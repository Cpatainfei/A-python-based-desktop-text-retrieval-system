   <HEADLINE> COLD_WAR ' S UNWITTING WARRIORS WONDER ABOUT THE PAST , FUTURE ; NUCLEAR TESTS : ROBERT GIORDANO TENDED SHEEP EXPOSED TO RADIATION AT CAMP PARKS , CALIF . LATER , HIS DAUGHTER DIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robert Giordano never thought_of himself as an unwitting guinea_pig or believed a daughter who died of severe birth_defects was a Cold_War casualty . But now he wonders . As a teen-ager , he was paid $ 1.25 an hour to tend sheep that were part of hundreds of radiation experiments at Camp Parks , an obscure military base 40 miles east of San Francisco in California ' s picturesque Livermore Valley . Giordano ' s chores included burying the droopy-skinned , black-faced beasts who died of radiation . Their limbs would fall_off in his bare hands as he pitched them into graves . His work_at this atomic ranch didn ' t concern him even when a daughter was born in 1983 without a trachea and with damaged internal_organs . But renewed interest in radiation experiments has created a nagging unease . &quot; I would like to know if there ' s any possible connection to those experiments and what happened to my daughter . Nothing will bring that baby back . But it would be a little easier to put behind us if we knew for_sure one way or another , &quot; said Giordano , 47 . &quot; I knew they were testing the animals for radiation , but I was never given any warnings or special instructions , &quot; he added in a recent interview . &quot; Shouldn ' t I have had some type of protective clothing or gloves or anything ? How hazardous was it ? Were they 100 % sure we weren ' t wandering in the wrong area ? Does being exposed to radiation cause birth_defects ? &quot; Giordano ' s questions , fears and doubts -- despite assurances that they are unfounded -- aren ' t the only ones with elusive answers . Thousands of people and their relatives have been pondering the legacies of the nuclear age since December , when U.S. Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary asked the government to review all radiation experiments and to compensate those who were harmed . One of these Cold_War battlegrounds was Camp Parks , a 2 # 000-acre site where the Navy and the Office of Civil Defense conducted tests between 1959 to 1980 on how to survive a nuclear attack . Hundreds of tests were done with fallout_shelters , crops grown in irradiated soil , farm_animals bombarded with radiation , and radioactive sand used to simulate fallout . At the same time , people lived_on or around the base . The Pleasanton School District operated a school seven blocks from where the radioactive sand was made . And the Job Corps -- a federal program for disadvantaged children -- used buildings where experiments were done . Although precautionary fences and warning signs were erected around &quot; hot &quot; areas , similar tests under modern-day standards would be impossible because of the threat of exposure . &quot; They would n ' t be allowed to do that today . It would never be approved . Never . There would be more controls , &quot; said James L . Thomas , who served as a radiation safety officer at Camp Parks for seven years . &quot; You ' d have to be absolutely 100 % sure ( that ) the radiation would be contained and enclosed and that no one could get_into the area. &quot; Thomas and those who conducted the tests say there are no health hazards , and inspectors said the base was clean in 1983 . But to dispel fears , camp commander Lt . Col . Mark Nelson ordered a re-examination of the work . A report is_due by the end of March . &quot; We ' d all like to know if there really is a nuclear bogyman out there , &quot; said Nelson , who served in the Persian_Gulf_War as a combat engineer with the Army ' s 82nd Airborne Division . &quot; I ' d like the image to go_away ( that ) we ' re some kind of time bomb. &quot; The review is being done_by the earth_sciences consulting firm of Woodward-Clyde . And some of the report is being written by James Sartor -- project manager on many of the Camp Parks radiation experiments . &quot; There ' s no danger in what we did , &quot; Sartor said . &quot; There were no human guinea_pigs involved in any of the experiments . Employees were never purposely part of the tests . We had a very rigid health physics program. &quot; The tests were monitored independently by the Atomic Energy Commission , which in 1975 became the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . &quot; There was no problem . They took air samples and radiation surveys . There was no hanky-panky . Everything was above board . These were highly competent people , &quot; said Ray Fish , a retired safety officer with the AEC who monitored the tests . &quot; People should have a whole_lot of confidence in the end results and in their inspectors. &quot; During an era when people were building back yard bomb_shelters , a Camp Parks test involved a 100-person fallout_shelter . To determine its habitability , volunteers lived inside the bunker for up_to 14 days -- the time it would take fallout to dissipate . One test involved inmates from the nearby Santa Rita County Prison . And on April 15 , 1960 , the bunker was rimmed with tons of burning scrap lumber to test its ability to withstand the heat of a bomb . Robert Campbell , an adviser to the National Assn . of Atomic Survivors , contended more_than wood was involved , however . He said radioactive material -- code-named &quot; Rolla &quot; -- was placed in the flaming piles to simulate a nuclear bomb , and volunteers were exposed to &quot; hefty doses &quot; of radiation . Sartor , Fish and Nelson flatly deny Campbell ' s allegations . Any documents that could prove or disprove Campbell ' s claim are under review by the Department_of_Energy and are unavailable for viewing . &quot; There exists no public documentation of it , &quot; Campbell admitted . But he added : &quot; It shows what happens when the government or a group of people go amok with science. &quot; Officials said the bunker was tested for its ability to shield against radiation , but no humans were inside at the time . Measurements were made by instruments . Other tests at Camp Parks included : * Testing the long-term effects of fallout on plants . From 1962 to 1965 , crops were grown in soil spiked with plutonium . The radioactive material was later packed into drums and buried in Beatty , Nev . * Determining the effects of whole-body radiation with animals . Behind a series of fences and warning signs , sheep were zapped with cobalt-60 from 1963 to 1973 . The radiation was stored underground behind lead shields , and mechanical arms lifted the cobalt from its protective envelopes . Some sheep were exposed for up_to 23 hours a day , 74 days at a time . Exposures were done about a mile from the sheep_pens , where donkeys , beagles , pigs and mice were also housed . In a separate experiment , about 100 sheep were injected with an iron isotope in 1971 . When they died , these injected sheep were also buried on site . * Decontaminating buildings and grounds . A site called the Target Complex , which simulated a typical neighborhood , consisted_of abandoned barracks , streets and lawns . Workmen sprinkled the area with radioactive sand using spreaders pushed by hand or towed behind a truck . The stuff was then hosed , swept or plowed away during cleanup . The sand contained lanthanum-140 , which has a half-life of 40 hours and decays to normal background_levels within 14 days . Ropes , warning signs and a barbed wire fence were eventually erected around the 17-acre area . The buildings were turned_over to the Job Corps and then torn_down to make room for a federal prison , where Patricia Hearst served time . * Simulating the effects of radiation on ship ' s hulls . Inside a gymnasium , the Navy sprayed sea water containing lanthanum-140 onto metal panels to test the effects of vessels if a nuclear bomb threw sea water into the air . Tests were done between 1961 and 1963 , and the gym was turned_over to the Job Corps in 1965 ( former heavyweight champion George Foreman trained there ) . In 1983 , demonstrators at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab were supposed to be detained there , but U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said , &quot; The risks are so grave and unknown , no court should be in the position of placing anyone in such risk. &quot; Anti-nuclear activists are particularly concerned about the Camp Parks school , which was closed_in 1971 -- not because of radiation concerns but because it didn ' t meet earthquake standards . A 1961 report by the AEC cited lack of proper safeguards . &quot; If one of the students did become contaminated , no one would find_out , &quot; the AEC said . &quot; This is part of the pattern where certain people were considered disposable by the nuclear Establishment , &quot; said Marylia Kelley of the Tri-Valley Citizens Against a Radioactive Environment . &quot; Unless the scientists claimed that they control the wind , they cannot have been guaranteeing those children ' s safety . &quot; I don ' t think these experiments can be justified either today or yesterday . If the community had known more about them at the time , ( we ) probably would have acted to stop them , &quot; Kelley said . One of the people pressing for answers is Peggy Stewart , who lived at Camp Parks and attended school there . From 1957 to 1973 , her father , Emory Pettigrew , was chief of fire protection and base security . As a child , Stewart roamed the base freely with her go-cart and dune buggy . She admits to youthful mischief , sneaking into buildings and getting past fences . And she kept quiet until reports of radiation experiments resurfaced . &quot; It ' s almost seemed like ' Silkwood , ' &quot; she said , referring to a movie about Karen Silkwood , a nuclear_power plant employee who died under suspicious circumstances after contending that the plant was unsafe . &quot; Everyone always lived with the fear that if you opened your mouth , you better fear for life. &quot; What ' s worrisome is that her father died of bone cancer in 1990 and suffered horrible headaches and sterility . Her mother lost a child at birth and later had a hysterectomy . Stewart , 39 , has been diagnosed with fibrous tumors and has suffered from headaches , swollen lymph_glands , anemia and high_blood_pressure . She also recalls pet sheep and rabbits that died on base . &quot; I don ' t think I ' m entitled to remuneration , but I ' d sure like to have some questions answered , &quot; said Stewart , who now lives_in Carefree , Ariz . &quot; Could some of these things have been related ? Is that the stuff that killed my rabbits and sheep ? What do these things do to people ? What did you expose us to ? What are our families going_to be exposed to ? Did you take all_the safety precautions ? . . . &quot; If you ' re going to do experiments , fine . But don ' t allow people to live_in and around the place , &quot; Stewart said . &quot; To be exposed to risk without being told about it is very wrong. &quot; Michelle Locke in Walnut Creek , Calif. , and Elizabeth Weise in San Francisco contributed to this report .</TEXT>
