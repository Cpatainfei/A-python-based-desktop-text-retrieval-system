   <HEADLINE> DISCOVERY GIVES_UP ON LAUNCH OF SATELLITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After three frustrating days , Discovery ' s crew gave_up Monday on casting a satellite into space , one of the main purposes of the shuttle mission . Astronaut Ronald Sega , who is in_charge of the trouble-plagued satellite , had little to say when Mission Control informed him that flight directors were calling it quits.But the tone of his voice said it all . &quot; Yeah , we copy , &quot; Sega said quietly . Sega and Discovery ' s five other crew_members , including Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev , had been trying since Saturday to deploy the Wake Shield Facility , a $ 13.5-million steel disk on which physicists hoped to manufacture pure semiconductor film . Researchers said high-quality samples , if obtained , could have led to more advanced electronics , including faster computers . The crew encountered one problem after another : glare from the sun , radio interference and , finally , a failed guidance sensor . After hours of debate by flight controllers over whether to release the Wake Shield as is , time ran_out . Monday afternoon was NASA ' s last chance ; the shuttle mission is scheduled to end Friday . Controllers could not be certain the Wake Shield would remain steady in flight , given the bad horizon sensor . An unstable satellite would jeopardize whatever growth of gallium arsenide film could be achieved and possibly prevent the crew from retrieving the craft for the trip home . With the Wake Shield shelved for this voyage , Discovery ' s crew turned_to other experiments : U.S.-Russian medical and radiation tests , Earth observations , laboratory work and another satellite release . A German science satellite is to be deployed Wednesday ; six metal balls also are to be ejected for tracking by space debris experts on the ground .</TEXT>
