   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS ; WHAT ' S COMING , WHEN , AND WHY IT ' S A BIG DEAL ; THE BETTING CONTINUES ON WIRELESS REVOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wireless communications arena , the big news of 1994 was the government ' s auction of airwaves in July , in which some of the biggest names in technology bet billions of dollars that a booming mass market in wireless will soon emerge . And the big news of 1995 -- at least the first month of it -- will involve another , similar auction , this one for licenses even more valuable than those sold in July . Winners in the current auction of licenses for so-called broad-band personal communications services will probably be announced in January , and the victors are expected to pay the government as much as $ 10 billion . But don ' t hold your breath waiting for the services that will emerge from this auction frenzy . While interactive video and data service ( IVDS ) , personal communications services ( PCS ) and a new type of cable service_called local multipoint distribution service ( LMDS ) all got the green_light in 1994 , it will cost billions of dollars and take several years for companies to build the necessary facilities . Providers will spend 1995 running a regulatory gantlet that will include obtaining final licensing approval from the Federal Communications Commission , getting tower construction permits from City_Hall and even securing the blessings of rival utility companies that may own the rights_of_way where wireless providers have to string cable . &quot; I do not expect major developments next year , &quot; said Bob Foosaner , a senior_vice_president at Nextel Communications Inc. , a Rutherford , N.J. , company that operates a wireless mobile radio service that competes with cellular_telephone service in Los Angeles and several other cities . Even if the latest and greatest in wireless communications won ' t be quite ready yet , those who sell cellular_telephone and paging services with today ' s technology should continue to do a land-office_business . Cellular phone_companies have been adding 1 # 000 customers a day as the increasingly mobile and computerized American work_force demands always-in-touch communications . Cellular services face a big challenge from the new wireless entrants because analog cellular providers now are short on capacity and do not have the flexibility to carry voice , data and other communications simultaneously in a single device . Cellular carriers are scrambling to deploy digital networks that will enable them to offer similar capabilities . All of this -- implementing new services and upgrading old -- represents a rare opportunity to get_in on the ground_floor of a major new industry , but it also promises to be frightfully expensive . So all_the big phone_companies are involved , along with the cable companies and many others , but alliances are the order_of_the_day . Look_for many_more in 1995 .
