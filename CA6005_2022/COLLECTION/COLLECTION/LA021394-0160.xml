   <HEADLINE> DOES CALIFORNIA HAVE A FUTURE AFTER ITS DELUGE OF DISASTERS ? ; POLITICAL FORECAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After temblors , wildfires , riots , mudslides and economic recession , what is the future of the state ? The Times asked seven California writers and historians . Gerald W . Haslam , Professor of American studies , California State University , Sonoma . The only thing that might not have a future is the California Dream , which never was real to begin with . Expectation always preceded reality in California . The quest_for el_dorado was rooted in an unreal expectation . When Americans came_with the Gold_Rush , they saw abundance ; there was no reason to say that anything could be denied . At some point , we Californians have to begin living within the means of the land , to start having a sustainable culture . Fernando J . Guerra , Professor of political_science , Loyola Marymount University The future of California rests with leaders who are willing to be innovative , not only in government but in industry , religious institutions and universities . California will be judged not only by the wealth it creates , but by how it treats its youngest , its oldest , its poorest . Jeff Lustig , Professor of government , former director of the Center for California Studies , California State University , Sacramento We ' ve got_to apply California ' s &quot; notorious &quot; reputation for innovation to political forms . We have to decentralize politics inside the state , make_it possible -- and necessary -- for citizens to participate in public affairs . Our current constitution was adopted when the state had 800 # 000 people . The very ways we go_about being public prevent us from implementing the public interest . Patricia Nelson Limerick , Professor of history , University of Colorado , Boulder The future of California is to move to Colorado and to other western states . The combination of discomfort from the economy and earthquakes and fires and ethnic tensions are making people pick_up and move . This is the pattern in American history . People pick a western location , thinking it will cure their problems . A lot of people moved to California to escape reckoning on limits on their freedom . Newcomers thought they could build their houses in a freer sort of way , only to discover that they had built_in fire zones or places where there are earthquakes . James D . Houston , Author of &quot; Californians : Searching for the Golden State &quot; California is going_to be profoundly affected by its rate of population growth . The state has been growing by more_than 1 # 000 people a day for more_than 50 years , and it has finally caught_up_with us . Every system in the state -- water , roads , housing , education -- is overloaded . The upside of the Northridge earthquake is if it manages somehow to discourage people from coming_to California . The birthrate and immigration are hard things to talk_about , because you have racial charges being thrown_back and forth . You can ' t fault people for having kids , but there ' s got_to be greater control of immigration and some education on birth_control . Gloria Lothrop , Professor , history at California Polytechnic University , Pomona . I see a very hopeful future , economically , with increased trade . Activity in the Wilmington-Long Beach Harbor will increase with the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . On the down side , as I listen to debates regarding family values , crime and violence , I sense a growing conservatism and wonder whether California will lose its position as the bellwether of trends . I find the idea of state division not as remote as some people would . With an increasingly youthful population and increasing demand upon social_services -- which will lead to less ( resources ) for higher education , infrastructure , arts and recreation -- I wonder if there won ' t be a call_for state division , with the idea that parts of the state that are not as affected by these demographic patterns may_not want to be burdened with the cost and responsibilities . Robert V . Hine , Professor of history emeritus , University of California , Riverside and Irvine campuses . California has always been a state of boom and bust throughout its history . We have always been able to pull_out of difficult periods , and I don ' t see why we can ' t pull_out again . Political Forecast was compiled by Therese K . Lee .</TEXT>
