   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A WITH SHIFRA M . GOLDMAN ; TAKING ' ARTISTIC GEMS ' OUT IN PUBLIC ; ' MODERN MEXICAN ART ' CURATOR SEES PLENTY OF JEWELS IN A SHOW SHE ADMITS ISN ' T FLAWLESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exhibition curators generally speak with unbridled enthusiasm about their own shows . They soft-pedal shortcomings or ignore them altogether -- if they can see them . Shifra M . Goldman , guest curator of &quot; Seven Decades : Modern Mexican Art From the Bernard Lewin Collection , &quot; at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana through April 25 , spoke in a recent interview to her show ' s weaknesses as well as its strengths . She also spoke freely about the museum , the collection on which the show is based , other shows and art critics . &quot; She ' s a pistol , &quot; said a Bowers spokesperson . sg , 2 * Question : How would you evaluate the Lewin Collection , on which &quot; Seven Decades &quot; is based , and how did_it aid or limit your vision for this show ? * Answer : While the Lewin Collection is certainly the largest collection ( of modern Mexican art ) in Southern California and possibly the country , it ' s one collection , and I was not free to draw from other collections . Still , I was able to glean a show that was more_than simply a collection of precious objects . Also , a collector who collects has one kind of collection . But we ' re talking_about a commercial gallery owner , someone who sells his work . After looking over the gallery collection , I chose X number of works to best represent a historical sweep , but the commercial_activities of the gallery have left great gaps . As I write in the ( exhibition ) guide , the show is &quot; an introduction to the pioneering and experimental conceptions and developments , &quot; and as such , it &quot; allows visitors to see a number of little-known artistic gems. &quot; Q : Artistic gems -- is that like an unassuming wine ? A : By gems I mean works that are not constantly reproduced -- outstanding small works that a museum might own . Mexican art is my area of specialization , yet there are works here that I ' d never before seen . At ( &quot; Mexico : Splendors of Thirty Centuries , &quot; at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1991 ) , they showed modern works that we ' d seen over and over and over , even on postcards ! Q : Since you brought it up , how does &quot; Seven Decades &quot; compare to the &quot; Splendors &quot; show ? A : The &quot; Splendors &quot; show was enormous . ( The 400-piece show was one of the biggest in LACMA ' s history. ) &quot; Seven Decades &quot; is a small show , under 100 works , and it has no pretensions to be a historical overview . To mount a purely historical show for Bowers would have been very difficult in terms of what I had available to me . The Mexican government could draw_on all_the resources of Mexico . And they did . They took pulpits out of churches , materials out of remote villages . . . and there were protests about that . When the &quot; Splendors &quot; show hit Los Angeles , the impact was huge . Los Angeles has the largest Mexican population of any city outside of Mexico_City , and it has an active Chicano art_movement . . . so the local Chicano community was very excited , and ( there were ) 350 subsidiary events from the Chicano community alone . Q : What were your overriding goals for this exhibition ? A : I wanted to put_together a show that would correspond to major shifts in ideas . . . . I ' m also very aware that modern Mexican art gets very rare play , at least outside of New York . I was very conscious , and so was Mr. Lewin , of the &quot; Splendors &quot; show , which was a splendid opportunity , but I thought heavily overloaded with ideological biases . Q : For instance ? A : It helped ( promote ) the NAFTA cause by portraying Mexico as a great civilization that continues without any contradictions . Yet today we watch the uprising of the Mayan peasants . But then , I ' m an art_historian , not a political_scientist . Q : As an art_historian , why do you say modern Mexican art gets &quot; rare play &quot; ? A : Many critics know only Eurocentric art , and anything that doesn ' t fit into that isn ' t treated well . Latin_American art is systematically ( treated as ) second_class . I ' ve tracked the Los Angeles edition of the L.A. Times for 25 years , and I have yet to find a critic who has any appreciation for any period or master of modern Mexican art . To say that Tamayo is not as_good_as Picasso , that ' s Eurocentrism . Even over the last 10 years , there are people who have written very stupidly about Latin_American art , simply out of ignorance or ( because they ' re ) convinced that there are only several European masters and they condemn everybody else . Putting_down Tamayo as not a very good painter , ( writing that ) after seeing a Matisse you cannot even consider Tamayo . . . . You don ' t have to paint like Matisse to be a very good painter . It was astounding to me that somebody could write this . Q : So modern Mexican art is getting play . A : The ' 80s were a Latin_American art boom , equivalent_to the Latin_American literature boom of the ' 60s . Those who do not comment on this phenomenon would be out of step . But it has not been commented on well in these pages . In the past it was really horrendous , but some people who write for The Times today , and some outside writers who have been brought_in , have been more sympathetic . The San Diego edition , for instance , had given excellent coverage , but I can ' t say why . . . . They ' ve been both critical and laudatory , but they ' ve been flexible enough to get_out from under their Eurocentric training . Learning as they go -- that to me is a very good thing . Q : What , specifically , still needs to be learned ? A : We have to combat the stereotypical notions that all art south of the Rio Grande is somehow exotic or folkloric , colorful and strident , and that one needn ' t concern oneself with artists who didn ' t work in magic . This art is not an exotic art . It ' s right in sweep with the international bank of ideas , only with a national concern . Like everybody , ( Mexican artists ) dip_into this bank , they contribute to it , they withdraw from it what pictorial , aesthetic and conceptual ideas they want , then shape them to their needs , their roots , and what they want to say . Tamayo has done so splendidly . He was very influenced by Picasso and Braque , but his art is his own . Latin_American artists are not imitations , or second_class -- these notions have to go . Q : Where there any glitches in putting_together the Bowers show ? A : Unfortunately , the museum didn ' t find the funding to do a catalogue , and the newsletter is fraught with errors . One glaring , obvious mistake I hope people see_through , they substituted Chicago for Chicano : Chicago mural movement instead of Chicano mural movement . The newsletter also identifies the Estridentista movement as loosely based on Picasso ' s &quot; Guernica , &quot; and Goya as a spiritualist . I don ' t know how Picasso ' s &quot; Guernica &quot; came_up , and Goya is not a spiritualist . ( These are ) very embarrassing errors . I wish they ' d been more careful . Q : Any other problems ? A : We lost one of the gems in our show when it was sold ( by the Lewin Gallery ) and sent to Mexico . I was very upset . It was very important to me to find another work by Maria Izquierdo , who is very hard to come_by . By some tremendous quirk of fate , the Bowers owned one her works . Instead of &quot; Horses , &quot; we now have &quot; Nanny and Child. &quot; Q : Why were you so upset about losing the Izquierdo work ? A : Unfortunately , the United States knows only one female Mexican artist . Frida Kahlo is like a star shining in a heaven without women . Olga Costa and Izquierdo are two others . Nobody among Mexican artists is given proper attention , and certainly the women get less .</TEXT>
