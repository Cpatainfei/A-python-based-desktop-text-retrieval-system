   <HEADLINE> ' FAMILY CAP ' ON WELFARE BENEFITS WILL GET BOOST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending months of intense debate within the Administration , President Clinton will propose making_it easier for states to deny additional benefits to women who have children while on welfare , senior Administration officials said Wednesday . The decision aligns Clinton with those inside and outside the Administration who argue that government must intensify its efforts to discourage out-of-wedlock births , which now constitute about 30 % of all births in the United States . &quot; We think it is very important to discourage additional births on welfare , &quot; one senior official said . &quot; We are saying that states that want to try this approach should be able to try it. &quot; But the &quot; family cap &quot; policy inspires even more intense opposition among liberals than the proposed two-year time_limit on benefits that is at the center of Clinton ' s welfare reform plan , which is now expected to be introduced shortly after the President returns from commemorating the 50th anniversary of D-day in Europe next month . Given its potential to affect the most intimate decisions of millions of women , the family cap issue is certain to provoke a polarized struggle in Congress . Many moderate and conservative legislators see the family cap as a way to promote personal responsibility , whereas liberals largely denounce it as racist and sexist social engineering . No other proposal may more starkly demonstrate the difficulty of finding common_ground between left and right on the emotional issues swirling through welfare reform . &quot; This is clearly one where there are very deep feelings on both sides of the issue and , apart from the families it directly affects , it has a large symbolic impact , &quot; said Mark Greenberg , an attorney with the Center for Law and Social_Policy in Washington . In fact , although Clinton settled_on the new policy at a Tuesday meeting , Administration officials still appear divided over how closely to identify with the controversial idea . Some officials took pains to say that the Administration does not intend to push states to adopt family cap policies , merely to smooth the way for those interested in the idea . One agency official lukewarm to the policy insisted that the decision leaves the Administration &quot; neutral &quot; on the question of whether more states should adopt the caps . But other senior officials acknowledged that by signaling at least tacit federal support for the family cap , the Administration plan inevitably will encourage more states to embrace the idea . Outside observers agreed . &quot; Inevitably , by framing it as a state option , it will be taken as a federal encouragement , &quot; Greenberg said . In opening the way for wider use of the family cap , Clinton continued a movement toward the center that has characterized his final_decisions on the welfare plan . Four weeks ago , Clinton rejected the idea of imposing a new casino tax as a way to pay_for more child-care assistance for the working poor -- a proposal fervently supported by liberals . And , although agreeing to phase_in his proposed two-year time_limit by imposing it on younger people first , the President has decided to allow states to require work after two years for older welfare recipients as well , senior officials said . That proposal , like the family cap , reflects Clinton ' s intention to give states more flexibility in managing welfare reform , officials said . Clinton will also propose easing the way for states to condition welfare grants for teen-agers on their school attendance and to encourage work by allowing recipients to keep more of their earnings without reducing their benefits , sources said . &quot; The notion of states trying different approaches and learning what we can from those different approaches makes enormous common_sense and political sense , &quot; said Delaware Gov . Thomas R . Carper , a Democrat who presented the Administration proposals to a closed_session of the National Governors ' Assn . executive board Wednesday . It is a sign of how far the welfare reform debate has shifted in the last year that the family cap Clinton will propose -- although anathema to liberal advocacy groups -- occupies a middle ground among the competing efforts to discourage out-of-wedlock births . As a presidential candidate , Clinton declared that he would allow states to experiment with the family cap proposal -- although he declined to sign such a law when he was governor of Arkansas . The Administration plan reflects that perspective . It would not require states to impose a family cap , but it would allow them to implement such policies without federal approval , sources said . Under current law , states cannot implement such policies without waivers from the Health and Human Services_Department , a process that can take months and require extensive negotiations . Only three states have received federal approval for a family cap plan . The George_Bush Administration approved a proposal from New Jersey and the Clinton_Administration has approved plans in Georgia and Arkansas . Applications are pending from California , Maryland and Wisconsin . Early results in New Jersey , the only state that has actually implemented a family cap , show that births have declined among welfare mothers since the policy went_into place . But it remains uncertain whether those numbers reflect the cap ' s impact , a general decline in childbearing in the state , or a decreased willingness among welfare recipients to report new births .</TEXT>
