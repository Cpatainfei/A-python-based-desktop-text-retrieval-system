   <HEADLINE> SMOG BUSTING RUN AMOK ; THE FEDERAL EPA SEEKS TO IMPOSE REGULATIONS THAT THREATEN TO ALIENATE CLINTON ' S NATURAL ALLIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mayor Richard Riordan ' s 11th-hour request that the Air Quality Management District delay its vote to impose Draconian air-pollution regulations on Southern California high lights yet another example of the Clinton_Administration ' s inexplicable anti-urban bi as . The newly invigorated Environmental Protection Agency is forcing local officials to adopt severe , ill-conceived measures that will hurt the nation ' s struggling urban economies while encouraging population and industrial migrations into precisely those less-urbanized regions where Bill_Clinton is most virulently opposed . Nowhere is this self-destructive tendency more apparent than in the EPA ' s takeover , earlier this year , of Southern California ' s air-pollution control efforts . Before federal intervention , there were many positive trends in local air-pollution abatement . The AQMD was curbing its worst regulatory excesses , weighing more carefully the economic costs and effectiveness of its clean-up efforts while promoting a &quot; user-friendly &quot; image . In conjunction with local companies , novel measures were developed , such_as pollution credits , and the region initiated a 30-year , $ 184-billion mass-transit program . Despite rapid population growth during the last two decades , Los Angeles has led the nation in improving its air quality . None of this was good_enough for the EPA . After losing a lawsuit alleging that it had not enforced federal air-pollution laws , the agency announced , in February , that it was developing federal implementation plans , or FIPs , for areas of the country that failed to meet Clean Air Act standards . Starting with California , the FIPs would mandate anti-pollution measures that could be substituted for local plans , such_as those developed by the AQMD , at the EPA ' s own discretion . Warily watched by other urban officials , the results in Southern California shocked even the most jaded observers of federal excess . During public hearings last month , the Administration unveiled a 1 # 700-page plan -- about 400 pages longer than its abandoned health plan -- to regulate , for the first time in history , everything that could possibly contaminate the air : interstate and international commerce , automobiles , trucks , ships , railroads , airplanes , factories , zero-emission vehicles , offices , retail businesses , mass transit , commuters , road_construction , aerosol sprays , pesticides , pleasure vehicles , lawn_mowers , farm equipment and back-yard barbecues . The FIP ' s 106 measures include novel , untested requirements to tax domestic and international ships and airlines up_to $ 10 # 000 per ton of emissions they generate ; mandatory &quot; no-drive &quot; days for residents and businesses ; diesel-truck engine standards that are presently unattainable , coupled with harsh fines for companies whose fleets fail to comply ; the retrofitting and downsizing of commercial vehicles ; limits on the deliveries that out-of-state trucks can make in the region , and severe agricultural-equipment restrictions . Even proponents of the FIP -- and the now closely related AQMD plan that stirred Riordan ' s anxiety -- admit that it will strip more_than 100 # 000 jobs from the local economy and cost $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion a year over 16 years . But the real costs are almost certainly higher . The environmental agency concedes that 60 of its proposed measures cannot be quantified . Independent appraisals of the FIP transportation and agricultural mandates alone amount to $ 192 billion and $ 257 billion , respectively . Other industry experts estimate a 40 % -to-60 % decline in Los Angeles ' airline , port and trucking_industries by 2005 , far more_than the government predicts . Even with such staggering commercial , employment and social costs , it is far from clear that the proposals will clear the air . Decreasing the size of trucks , for example , could generate more pollution by increasing the number of trips required to move the same amount of freight . The FIP also mandates emission reductions that the EPA concedes it doesn ' t know how to achieve . Ironically , the EPA ' s plan encourages and reinforces the dispersion of high-wage , high-skill urban industries to peripheral regions of the country , fostering pollution where it is not currently a problem . As cities like Los Angeles become economically untenable , families and businesses flood into ecologically sensitive , pristine regions , including the Sierra_Nevada foothills , where 8 million Californians now live , or into the intermountain west . This spreads environmentally harmful industrial and urban development problems to some of the most sensitive and least-monitored parts of the nation . And , by strengthening peripheral regions at the expense of major cities , the Administration alienates its natural political allies in favor of Nevada , Utah or North Carolina , where the President ' s approval ratings are measured in single digits , or the low teens . How could such perverse results be possible ? Unlike the mostly homogenous peripheral regions , major cities sustain highly vocal special-interest groups that have no direct ties to the local economy -- public-interest lawyers , actors , university professors , for example . Backed by an often sympathetic media , they advance agendas that undervalue middle-class or business_concerns . Time and again , the Administration has committed the mistake of believing that by responding to such constituencies , it would be promoting &quot; enlightened pro-urban &quot; policies . As with the FIPs , however , it then discovers that it seriously miscalculated the political support for and consequences of its interventions , forcing a mad scramble to save face while trying to win_back the trust of more mainstream interests . A second problem is the Administration ' s chronic policy incoherence . Southern California , like other non-compliant air-pollution regions , cannot meet federal standards because of its geography and weather , not because residents drive or own more cars . Imposing the same regulations that work in regions where wind or rain disperse pollutants severely harms industries in less accommodating climates . The only economically feasible solution for such trouble spots is full-scale development and distribution of zero-emission vehicles and other non-polluting technologies to reduce &quot; mobile source &quot; emissions , which cause 90 % of Southern California ' s smog , and lightening industrial regulatory burdens . But the EPA seems uninterested in such an approach . While conducting hearings on California ' s FIP , it bowed to pressure from U.S. automakers and thwarted efforts by several Eastern states to adopt California-style electric-car mandates . Abandoning the possibility of vigorous federal support for the technologies California needs to meet clean-air standards , the Administration could only propose further regulation of the state ' s urban industries . Virtually the same political logic threatens to produce equally damaging results in water policy . Earlier this year , the Administration waded into California ' s stalled Bay Delta negotiations and proposed huge water diversions from statewide aqueducts to satisfy environmentalists ' concerns . Agriculture and environmental uses , however , already consume 90 % of California ' s developed-water supplies . Just 10 % goes_to all_the state ' s urban regions , including approximately 3 % to Los Angeles County . By diverting water to the Delta without also reforming archaic state and federal policies that lock the state ' s water into less productive non-urban uses , the Administration further imperils increasingly tenuous urban-water supplies -- all to benefit bedrock Republicans like Central Valley growers . Stung by growing opposition to its plans , the EPA desperately hopes that the AQMD will vote next month to impose most of its proposals , thus shielding the Administration from criticism . Riordan ' s timely intervention , however , has at least forced a discussion of alternatives to the EPA , and could cause many of the most onerous measures to be dropped completely . But a far more comprehensive rethinking of the relationship between the federal_government and local economies is ultimately required if urban_areas in California , and the rest of the country , are to flourish . The constant threat that the federal_government will intervene in the economy is a principal reason why the state ' s urban regions are hemorrhaging much of their resources to less-regulated areas . To alleviate such problems , Washington must cede greater authority to local entities and then unambiguously support the key initiatives they identify -- such_as zero-emission vehicle development or water-allocation reforms -- that can achieve important environmental or social goals without eroding industrial vitality . Rather than weaken his core constituencies , Clinton should champion such efforts . If he loses the cities , he will , without fail , also lose his presidency. *</TEXT>
