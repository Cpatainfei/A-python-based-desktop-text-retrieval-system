   <HEADLINE> WEST MEETS EAST AT THE SIMON ; LACMA COLLABORATION MIXES SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF INDIA , NEPAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sad fact of life at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena is that many visitors don ' t bother to go downstairs after seeing the Old_Masters , French Impressionist paintings and Asian artworks on the main floor . Of those who do , few venture beyond the Degas display at the base of the spiral staircase and still fewer wander as far as the final gallery of Southeast Asian art -- except to gaze through a window at a stone Buddha in a sunken_garden . But life goes_on at the Simon , and facts change . The museum ' s last outpost now lures visitors with seductive sights and sounds . Fresh rose-colored paint warms the gallery ' s walls , Ravi Shankar ' s recorded music fills the air and classical Indian musical_instruments sit on a red_carpet in front of the window . All this is a backdrop for a new exhibition , &quot; A Tale of Three Muses : Music , Poetry and Art in India and Nepal , &quot; which qualifies as a genuine milestone in the museum ' s evolution . The show is the Simon ' s first collaboration with another museum , in this case the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . Simon curator Gloria Williams and Pratapaditya Pal , LACMA ' s senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art , have drawn_on the two institutions ' resources to show_off little-known treasures and explore a multidisciplinary theme . &quot; Mr. Simon had a great admiration for the art of India and Nepal , &quot; said Sara Campbell , director of the Simon Museum . &quot; This exhibition is both a tribute to his interest and a chance for Southern California ' s two great collections of South Asian art to share their riches. &quot; * Indeed , Indian and Southeast Asian artworks compose one of the greatest -- though largely unsung -- strengths of LACMA ' s collection . The Simon Museum is generally celebrated for its European art , but Simon became a passionate collector of Asian art in the 1970s -- after his marriage to actress Jennifer Jones , who had studied Eastern philosophy and persuaded him to take his first trip to India . At the heart of the landmark exhibition is a rare album of 36 paintings from Nepal , purchased in 1979 by Simon . They are accompanied by eight paintings from an addendum to the album , acquired in 1973 by LACMA . As to why , when and where the loose-leaf album was separated , little is known , but the fact that the two parts ended_up in Southern California paved the way to reuniting the paintings for the first time since they were divided . The jewel-like paintings -- each measuring about 7 by 5 1 / 2 inches -- come from a genre that flourished during the 17th Century , Williams said . Deriving their name , ragamala , from the Indian term for a garland of melodies , or ragas , the paintings epitomize a tradition of giving music a visual form . Musicians conceived_of musical_modes as having divine and human forms . Poets interpreted the melodies as verses and artists painted the verses , often including Sanskrit text with their pictures . That explains the &quot; Three Muses &quot; in the show ' s title , but deciphering the paintings can be difficult . The exhibition ' s text panels and labels help , but they also reveal unsuspected subtleties . Visitors learn , for example , that ragas not only have musical and human form , they refer to colors , passions , seasons and times_of_day . While musical ragas could be used for religious purposes , pictorial ragas were secular and earthy -- typically portraying Hindu gods , princes and beautiful women in an eternal cycle of love and longing . * Each of the paintings in the album presents figures in an architectural framework , with poetry at the top of the sheet . The paintings are displayed in groups of six , with a portrayal of a male figure surrounded by five depictions of women who either await his arrival or greet him in various states of emotion . The women -- who sprinkle flower petals on their beds or amuse themselves in gardens -- appear to have nothing better to do than prepare_for trysts and pout when their lovers are tardy , but their task in these paintings is to evoke erotic moods and amorous situations . They are archetypes rather than personalities . Although little is known of how ragamala paintings were used , they were produced for Hindu and Muslim noblemen and regarded_as prestigious gifts , Williams said . The work owned by the Simon and County museums is thought to have been commissioned by a king who presided over Bhaktapur , in the Kathmandu Valley . In contrast to the dark , predominantly red Nepali works , several Indian ragamala paintings from LACMA ' s collection portray figures and cross-sections of buildings in a varied palette of pastels and bright hues . * Musically-themed stone and metal sculptures from the two museums ' and Jennifer Jones Simon ' s collections provide a counterpoint of art-in-the-round . Unlike the paintings , which secret erotic details in tiny spaces , the sculptures flaunt sensuousness . Muscular gods and voluptuous goddesses play flutes and stringed instruments , while a group of five celestial musicians -- some with animals heads -- compose an orchestra along one wall . This sculptural group joined LACMA ' s collection more_than a year ago , but it is making its Southern California debut at the Simon Museum . * &quot; A Tale of Three Muses : Music , Poetry and Art in India and Nepal , &quot; Norton Simon Museum , 411 W .
