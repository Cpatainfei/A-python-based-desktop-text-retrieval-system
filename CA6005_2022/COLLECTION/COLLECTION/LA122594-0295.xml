   <TEXT> A Day Without O.J. Is Like a Day Without Live Team Coverage of Absolutely Nothing , Soon to Be a Movie of the Week &quot; Somebody ' s in the back ! ... Somebody ' s in the back ! ... I can ' t see who it is ! ... Now they ' re pulling_away ! ... No ... that ' s a woman I can ' t identify ! &quot; -- KTLA-TV reporter Ron Olsen , in reportage typical of that from those on watch outside O.J. Simpson ' s mansion the day he disappeared ( Calendar , June 19 ) . * &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , it ' s a reprieve . I get ( more time ) to cut the movie. &quot; -- Robert Lovenheim , executive producer of Fox ' s made-for-TV O.J. Simpson movie , on the network ' s decision to delay its airing until the jury is sequestered ( Calendar , Aug . 29 ) . * &quot; If you can ' t suppress ' em , join ' em. &quot; -- Times critic Howard Rosenberg on Judge Lance Ito ' s decision to be interviewed by Tritia Toyota for KCBS-TV ( Calendar , Nov . 16 ) * &quot; The sirens of mythology pale in comparison to the lure of seeing yourself on CNN . The results , however , can be about the same. &quot; -- Judge Ito , in pretrial advice to fellow judges ( The Times , Nov . 15 ) . M-I-C , K-E-Y ... Why ? Because We ' re Leaving You ! &quot; Jeffrey has a better job than I do . He has all_the fun stuff.... He is still the best golden_retriever I ever met. &quot; &quot; -- Disney chairman Michael Eisner , on studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg ( Calendar , July 24 ) . * &quot; Eisner called Jeff a golden_retriever in the L.A. Times . You don ' t use that term for a 43-year-old man responsible_for the highest-grossing film in the history of the studio . His golden_retriever is going_to turn_into a Rottweiler. &quot; -- Unnamed screenwriter ( Entertainment Weekly , Sept . 9 ) . * &quot; I ' ll start_up a company , and later you ' ll buy_it . Then I ' ll end_up working for you. &quot; -- Jeffrey Katzenberg , recounting what he jokingly told Eisner upon resigning from Disney ( Time , Sept . 5 ) . * &quot; People ask me what I ' m going_to do now . I ' m going_to Disney World . I really am. &quot; -- Katzenberg , on serious immediate post-resignation plans ( Newsweek , Sept . 5 ) . * &quot; Maybe I ' ll go_over to Dive ! and make sub sandwiches. &quot; -- Katzenberg ( Time , Sept . 5 ) . * &quot; Jeffrey Katzenberg ' s exit will be Michael Eisner ' s Machiavellian loss -- and Corporation X ' s El Dorado. &quot; -- Steven Spielberg , future co-founder of that very same Corporation X ( The New Yorker , Sept . 26 ) . * &quot; It ' s about a father not being able to accept a son. &quot; -- Katzenberg , asked to allegorize the big breakup ( Time , Sept . 5 ) . * &quot; The first change I ' m going_to make is not having a target of how many pictures to do . we ' ll start from , ' How many good ideas can we make ? &quot; ' -- New Disney Studios head Joe Roth , painting a sharp contrast between his policies and Katzenberg ' s ( Entertainment Weekly , Sept . 9 ) . All I Have to Do Is Dream ... and Raise Billions in Venture_Capital &quot; I look_at the three of us , and think , ' This has got_to be the Dream Team. &quot; ' -- Jeffrey Katzenberg , giving informal name to the new-studio troika formed with David Geffen and Steven Spielberg at a press_conference ( The Times , Oct . 25 ) . * &quot; This is as if Babe_Ruth , Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio got together. &quot; -- Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein ( The Times , Oct . 13 ) . * &quot; The first call I got was from Michael Eisner , who couldn ' t have been more gracious and excited. &quot; -- Katzenberg , at the October &quot; Dream Team &quot; press_conference . * &quot; Did you believe him ? &quot; -- Waggish reporter , asking obvious follow-up question . * Politics and Loathing in Los Angeles &quot; Y ' all said it is difficult to be a conservative in Hollywood . It ' s a little difficult , but I always remember that statistics prove that one out of three Hollywood conservatives goes_on to be President of the United States. &quot; -- Rob Long , a &quot; Cheers &quot; writer , at an extremely rare conservative media summit sponsored by the National Review ( TV Etc. , Nov. ) . * &quot; A few minutes later , CAA shogun Michael Ovitz introduced the second most powerful man in the room : ' The President of the United States ! &quot; ' -- Ted Casablanca , recounting a Creative Artists Agency bash honoring President Clinton ( Premiere , Feb. ) . Now If Only Jane Could Fool the New Congress Into Thinking They ' re Funding the N.R.A... &quot; Any move by the NEA in the last six years can easily be construed as being motivated ... to avoid controversy . If this had happened in 1990 , there would have been an outcry in the community . I ' m not seeing that happen this year , which is disturbing to me . It ' s the frog being ( slowly ) boiled in water. &quot; -- Christine Robbins , executive co-director of the New Langston Arts , after the NEA announced $ 1.65 million in funding cuts ( The Times , Oct . 26 ) . * &quot; I ' m disappointed that it ' s happening now under Jane Alexander ' s tenure . You would hope that at this point under the Clinton_Administration , with Jane as a leader , that the leadership could be found to make_sure we don ' t continue to demonize artists . Obviously , it ' s the same old game. &quot; -- Adolfo V . Nodal , general_manager of L.A. ' s Cultural Affairs Department ( The Times , Oct . 26 ) . * &quot; The public should be able to expect to attend a publicly funded performance without being exposed to HIV-infected blood. &quot; -- Letter sent by Sens . Robert C . Byrd ( D-W.Va. ) and Don Nickles ( R-Okla. ) to the NEA , suggesting that the agency ' s funding could be &quot; in serious jeopardy &quot; after news of a bloody performance art piece by Ron Athey in Minneapolis -- funded to the tune of $ 150 -- raised a ruckus ( The Times , June 21 ) . * &quot; It ' s really outrageous when one performance is used to overshadow the extraordinary programs that this agency has put into place. &quot; -- NEA director of public affairs Cherie Simon ( The Times , June 21 ) * &quot; I ' d rather focus_on the plethora of grants that everybody can agree on. &quot; -- NEA Chairman Jane Alexander ( The Times , April 16 ) . * Darkness on the Edge of Town &quot; I still see stuff ( in the press ) -- ' Kurt Cobain , the whiny , complaining , neurotic , bitchy guy who hates everything , hates rock stardom , hates his life. ' And I ' ve never been happier in my life.... I ' m really thankful , and every month I come_to more optimistic conclusions . I just hope I don ' t become so blissful I become boring. &quot; -- Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain , giving meaning to his &quot; Teen Spirit &quot; coda &quot; a denial &quot; ( Rolling Stone , Jan . 27 ) . * &quot; I haven ' t felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music ... for too many years now . I feel guilty beyond words about these things.... The fact is , I can ' t fool you , any one of you . It simply isn ' t fair to you or to me.... I need to be slightly numbed in_order to regain the enthusiasm I had as a child.... I ' m too_much of an erratic , moody person , and I don ' t have the passion anymore , so remember , it ' s better to burn_out than to fade away. &quot; -- Cobain ' s April suicide note , as quoted by wife Courtney Love . * &quot; He left a note . It ' s more like a letter to the ( expletive ) editor.... He ' s such an ( expletive ) . I want you all to say ' ( expletive ) ' really loud . This note should be pretty easy to understand . The wording ' s all from Punk_Rock 101. &quot; -- A bitter and tearful Love , preparing to read her husband ' s final missive to thousands of grief-stricken fans gathered at a Seattle memorial service . * &quot; The big question ( I always get ) is , nobody can be that depressed . Well , I ' m writing_about certain things , and I ' m trying to stay within the parameters . With this record I had something I wanted to say . If I had written a happy friggin ' song about smokin ' pot and shootin ' cops , I would n ' t have put it on the record anyway ; it would n ' t fit... But , as I would think a lot of writers are , I ' m more motivated by certain extremes than I am by feeling , ' Oh , I woke_up and it ' s a nice day today and I feel OK , I ' m gonna write a song about that. ' There ' s enough of that out there that I don ' t think I could eloquently comment on anything that Paul McCartney hasn ' t already said . I doubt he could write a song about wanting to kill yourself as well as I could , but who knows ? &quot; -- Nine Inch Nails ' Trent Reznor ( Calendar , March 6 ) . * &quot; Someone wrote a letter the other day about ' Eddie ( It ' s So Hard to Be a Rock_Star ) Vedder. ' Well , I just want to clarify . It ' s not hard to be a rock_star . If you want to go_around ( expletive ) women and cleaning a bunch of teen-agers out of all their dough because they like your band and charge them up the ying for T-shirts and concert tickets , that ' s easy . What ' s hard is trying to stop playing the game ... to try to treat people fairly and with respect. &quot; -- Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder ( Calendar , Nov . 20 ) . * Beaten to a Pulp &quot; You usually don ' t hear a music cue when something horrible is about to happen . Real-life violence isn ' t that way . It ' s more like one minute you ' re waiting for a bus and the next minute people are chasing each other with baseball_bats . that ' s how I try to play it in my movies. &quot; -- Quentin Tarantino ( Calendar , Sept . 11 ) . * &quot; Violence is a color_in Quentin ' s palette . Some work with musical numbers . Quentin works with violence . But unlike most filmmakers , he shows its impact . In his movies , violence is hyper-real . It ' s not just a style thing. &quot; -- &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; co-exec producer Stacey Sher ( Vanity_Fair , July ) . * &quot; When I ' m getting serious about a girl , I show her ' Rio Bravo , ' and she better ( expletive ) like it. &quot; -- Tarantino ( Vanity_Fair , July ) . * &quot; As much as I like John Travolta , I couldn ' t bring myself to watch some ( expletive ) talking-baby movie . But I ' ve seen everything else he ' s done. &quot; -- Tarantino , on the limits to being a fan ( Vanity_Fair , July ) . * &quot; I played myself in both games . And I won . Both games. &quot; -- John Travolta , on being coerced by Tarantino into playing actual vintage &quot; Grease &quot; and &quot; Welcome Back , Kotter &quot; board_games with the director as a condition of being cast in &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; ( Vanity_Fair , July ) . * &quot; I was thrown_off my game on ' Welcome Back , Kotter ' because I normally play Barbarino. &quot; -- Tarantino , justifying his loss ( Premiere , Nov. ) . Speaking of Games : Godzilla vs . the Smog Monster , or , QT Takes On Ollie &quot; Any time you try to get_across a big idea , you ' re shooting yourself in the foot . First , you need to make a good movie . And in the process , if there ' s something in it that comes_across , that ' s great . And it shouldn ' t be this big idea . It should be a small idea , from which everyone can get something different . I mean , if you ' re making a movie and your big idea is that war is bad , why do you even need to make a movie ? If that ' s all you ' re trying to say , just say it . It ' s only two words : WAR IS BAD . Wait , wait . that ' s three words . Two words would be even better : WAR BAD. &quot; -- Quentin Tarantino ( Playboy , Sept. ) . * &quot; Basically , ( Oliver Stone ) and I are pretty much at_odds as far as our sensibilities and styles are concerned . I like things unexplained . He ' s obviously not into that.... His biggest problem is that his obviousness cancels_out his energy and his energy pumps up his obviousness . He ' s Stanley Kramer with style. &quot; -- Tarantino , who thoroughly disowned &quot; Natural Born Killers , &quot; Stone ' s very reworked adaptation of an original Tarantino script ( Premiere , Nov. ) . * &quot; I was saying , ' Quentin , you ' re in your 20s . You ' re making movies about movies . I ' m making movies about the life that I ' ve lived to my 40s . I ' ve seen more violence than you ' ve ever seen in your life . I ' ve been in Vietnam . I ' ve been shot . If you want to talk_about violence , let ' s get real. &quot; ' -- Stone ( Premiere , Nov. ) . * &quot; I thought it was a good first draft.... There ' s a cult_of_personality for ( Tarantino ) , but that ' s such an inside thing , such an in-joke that it doesn ' t have much meaning to me . At the end of the day , who ' s going_to know who he was ? ... Tarantino cultists will say there ' s no humor in my film . But sit with an audience , they laugh -- and the movie ' s doing very well , way more_than our projections , and probably a lot better than any Tarantino film will ever do.... No one in the history of movies has had as much press as he ' s had , with no success. &quot; -- Stone , in the period between the releases of &quot; NBK &quot; and &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; ; at last count in the contest , Tarantino ' s film had racked_up $ 58.8 million to Stone ' s $ 49.5 million ( Empire , Dec. ) . * &quot; I have a ' Platoon ' game . I really would love to play the ' Platoon ' game with Oliver Stone . But me and him are too_much on the outs. &quot; -- Tarantino ( Premiere , Nov. ) . * &quot; Yeah , I ' d be glad to play the game with him. &quot; -- Stone ( Premiere , Nov. ) . The Best of Dana Delany &quot; There ' s something about white Jockeys that ' s so male and gross that I like . There ' s something dirty-sexy about them . And if they have stains on them , that ' s better. &quot; -- Dana Delany ( Us , Sept. ) . * &quot; When I told ( my friends ) I planned to portray the mistress of a resort on a mythical tropical island who initiates guests into the world of S &amp; M sex , they said , ' Finally , the real you ! &quot; ' -- Delany on &quot; Exit to Eden &quot; ( Premiere , July ) . * &quot; I went_to a_few private homes with ( a dominatrix ) and observed some scenes . There is something wonderfully , um , existential about standing in the bedroom of a man whom you don ' t know , with his naked rear_end ...and you ' re spanking it . -- Delany ( Premiere ) * &quot; I ' d like to say that I am not turned_on by the centerfold anymore . I like the ones from the ' 60s.... Big breasts and spanky pants , I ' m telling you ! Most men I know feel the same way.... It bothers me that boys growing_up now -- and girls , because girls read Playboy , too , and they compare themselves -- are going_to think that that ' s what a body looks_like . Of course , I ' m lucky to have big boobs , so I don ' t have to worry about that. &quot; -- Delany ( Playboy , July ) . Hooked On Online &quot; I just hope it ' s not one guy downloading it over and over again. &quot; -- Teri Hatcher , whose computerized photos have been downloaded 12 # 000 times by America Online subscribers ( People , Dec . 19 ) . * &quot; It was the only person I talked to for months . I just got caught_up in it . It was the void that you talk to . And since I didn ' t speak_to anybody else , I had to get_in trouble some way. &quot; -- Courtney Love , proud Mac owner , on her famous tell-all America Online computer postings ( Rolling Stone , Dec . 15 ) . Breaking Up Is Hard to Do &quot; We are heterosexual and monogamous and take our commitment very seriously . Reports of a divorce are totally false. &quot; -- Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford , in an ad taken_out in the London Times a_few months before they separated * &quot; Home is where your toothbrush is. &quot; -- Publicist Stan Rosenfield , cryptically denying separation rumors about then-client Shannen Doherty and her husband of five months , Ashley Hamilton ( Us , March ) . * &quot; After the DNA test I went my own way , and I see she ' s saying things like ' In the eyes of heaven it ' s his. ' Well , have the church pay your rent ! Have the Pope pay your car rental ! &quot; -- Sylvester Stallone , on ex-girlfriend -- but not mother of his child -- Janice Dickinson ( Details , Nov. ) . * &quot; I am a classic battered and abused wife ... ( Tom Arnold ) hit me , struck me , threw objects at me , pushed me against walls. &quot; -- Roseanne , in divorce papers filed_in April . * &quot; I must apologize for letting nasty gossip and lies break me down . I just lost it. &quot; -- Roseanne , dropping divorce proceedings three days later . * &quot; Tom Arnold ' s penis is three inches long . OK , I ' ll say four , ' cause we ' re trying to settle. &quot; -- Roseanne , in a standup performance at the Comedy Store on Nov . 19 , where she also discussed her impending marriage to bodyguard Ben Thomas . Oscar Talk &quot; This is the best drink of water after the longest drought of my life. &quot; -- Steven Spielberg , clutching his best picture Oscar ( Calendar , March 23 ) . * &quot; I told Steve , if I ' d known how famous he was going_to be , I ' d have had my uterus bronzed. &quot; -- Leah Adler , Spielberg ' s mother ( Calendar , March 23 ) . * &quot; I know that my work in this ( movie ) is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels . We know their names , they number a_thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight . They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all , a healing embrace that cools their fevers , that clears their skin and allows their eyes to see the simple , self-evident common-sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written_down on paper by wise_men , tolerant men in the City of Philadelphia 200 years ago . God bless you all , God have mercy on us all and God bless America. &quot; -- Tom Hanks , accepting his best actor Oscar for &quot; Philadelphia &quot; . * &quot; We ' ve got dogs , we ' ve got dinosaurs back there . The whole backstage is covered with newspaper . Finally they found something to do with the L.A. Calendar sections. &quot; -- Oscar host Whoopi Goldberg , in one of many digs at The Times . What ' s Wrong with Hollywood , in Three Easy Steps &quot; I ' ve been brought just about every TV_show imaginable . Last week somebody came_into my office pitching the Baldwin brothers as ' My Three Sons. &quot; ' -- Producer David Permut ( Time , May 30 ) . * &quot; I was in a theater the other night when a trailer came_on for a film that ' s probably going_to be the No . 2 summer movie at a major Hollywood studio . And when it was over , some guy in the back of the theater yelled out , ' Video ! ' And half the theater applauded . I got a chill down my spine , because that could have been one of my films. &quot; -- Joe Roth of Disney ( Calendar , April 24 ) . * &quot; I recently lost 60 pounds . Here I was eating a low-cal diet , and every time I went_to the movies I was getting three days ' worth of fat. &quot; -- Roger Ebert , one of millions dismayed about the alarming study on popcorn and coconut_oil ( Entertainment Weekly , May 13 ) .</TEXT>
