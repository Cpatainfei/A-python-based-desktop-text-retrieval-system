   <HEADLINE> RAIN CREATES MUDSLIDES , CLOSES ROAD ; WEATHER : SUDDEN DOWNPOUR IN SOUTH COUNTY PRODUCES WALL OF MUD AND DEBRIS THAT FLOWS INTO LAGUNA CANYON ROAD BUSINESSES . A DRY WEEKEND IS EXPECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A surprise storm dumped nearly half an inch of rain over parts of Orange County , causing mudslides and road closures Thursday in fire-scarred Laguna Beach . Mud &quot; went_through every square_inch of the shop , &quot; said Bob Chenault , manager of Stricker Automotive , which was among shops in the 2000 block of Laguna Canyon Road hardest hit by a six- to 18-inch wall of mud and debris . The road was closed , and no injuries were reported . Chenault spent the morning shoveling mud from inside the shop and from a parking_lot . Workers at Stricker Automotive and other businesses in the complex had scrambled to try to prevent the mud and water from entering their shops . Some hastily erected a dam made of a tow truck , a flatbed truck , bricks , plywood , sandbags and anything else they could get their hands on . &quot; Within 10 minutes we had mud everywhere , &quot; said Norman Wert , head mechanic at Canyon Auto Repair . &quot; It just came_down like a river . It was quick. &quot; A storm cell from an unstable weather system along the Southern California coast unleashed the torrent that dropped nearly half an inch of rain within an hour in Laguna Beach and . 87 of an inch in Santa Ana , according to Laguna Beach Battalion Fire_Chief Joe McClure and other officials who tracked the storm by computer from a city command center . The weekend is expected to be fair and dry with some high cloudiness , said Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc. , which forecasts weather for The Times . Southern California can expect a warming trend with temperatures in the mid-60s , and possibly in the low 70s by Monday . While only trace amounts of rain fell_in Fullerton and Yorba Linda , the capricious rainstorm struck the southern portion of Orange County with moderate amounts of rainfall , including the Sand Canyon area of Irvine , which received . 43 of an inch . * &quot; We ' re faring pretty well , &quot; said Jack Stubbs , emergency planning officer for San Clemente , which suffered a massive landslide during a rainstorm a year ago . &quot; We ' re dry and the slide area is intact. &quot; Similarly , Anaheim Battalion Chief Rudy Weyland reported that Anaheim Hills , which also had slides last year , came_through the rain without problems . Laguna Beach Fire Capt . Api Weinert said the storm ' s quickness caught the city by surprise . &quot; We heard there was supposed to be rain likely by about 6:30 a.m. , and we manned the command center between 7 and 7:30 a.m. , &quot; Weinert said . &quot; I was_on the telephone with the National Weather Service , and they were telling me to expect only a 60 % chance of rain when it was already raining here. &quot; In about an hour , nearly half an inch of rain fell on the South County city , he said . City officials said that at least half an inch of rain must fall before they will order evacuations in areas devastated by the Oct . 27 fire that swept_through parts of Laguna . The city was among victims of last fall ' s firestorms , which burned_off soil-stabilizing brush and grass from hills around and within the city . More_than 16 # 680 acres of vegetation and 366 homes were lost . A week later , a heavy downpour flooded streets and damaged homes , prompting Laguna Beach to establish a computer weather-tracking system inside a command center where workers are_on call_in case of the threat of rain . Most of the silt dams , sandbagging and other diversion techniques implemented in preparation for rain kept water and mud away from homes and buildings , Weinert said . The unstable storm also created waterspouts in the Pacific_Ocean that traveled up the San Diego County coast , Thoren said . &quot; The upper-level system that tracked directly right over you in Orange County was not enough to develop heavy rain , but very spotty rainfall , &quot; Thoren said . &quot; That stuff is very hard to predict as_to who ' s going_to get_it and who ' s not. &quot;</TEXT>
