   <HEADLINE> ' AUSCHWITZ LIE ' BILL DEFEATED IN GERMANY ' S UPPER HOUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Germany ' s upper house of Parliament threw_out a government bill Friday for tougher anti-crime measures , including laws to counter neo-Nazi propaganda and to criminalize the so-called &quot; Auschwitz Lie. &quot; The Bundesrat had called_for elements in the bill aimed at fighting the far right to be separated from measures aimed at ordinary crime . But the government called that suggestion &quot; totally absurd. &quot; The rejected bill would have made the &quot; Auschwitz Lie &quot; -- denying that the Holocaust happened -- a criminal offense and would have broadened the ban on the use of Nazi symbols in Germany .</TEXT>
