   <TEXT> When the Rev . Richard J . Anderson arrived_at Sierra Madre Congregational Church the morning of Jan . 17 , he entered the 66-year-old sanctuary to find fallen plaster and damaged stained-glass_windows . He was relieved . Through the years , Anderson has learned to expect the worst from earthquakes . In 1987 , the church put_off expansion plans when the Whittier Narrows quake damaged plaster and concrete . The plans were back on again three years ago , but the Sierra Madre quake severely damaged the bell_tower and choir room . Repairs cost $ 350 # 000 ; the church postponed expansion again . The congregation was about to again submit pledges on the $ 2.3-million expansion and renovation project when the Northridge quake hit . After the Whittier Narrows quake , church_members pledged the funds needed to repair the damage and to retrofit the church , a $ 140 # 000 project that was completed eight months before the 1991 quake struck . &quot; We have a long history of earthquake-related damage , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; This is really not something new for us. &quot; This time , the pledge drive is proceeding .</TEXT>
