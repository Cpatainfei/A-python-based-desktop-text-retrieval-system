   <HEADLINE> DANCERS BANNED AT HIGH_SCHOOL FIND AN AUDIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A teen-age choreographer will finally get the chance to present in public a dance that a high_school principal banned from a school dance concert , sparking a controversy over free expression . Choreographer Desiree Roble , 17 , and three other students from the California Academy of Mathematics and Science in Carson will perform Roble ' s piece this weekend during a dance concert at El Camino College in Torrance . The students had been looking_for a venue since their number was dropped from a March 25 performance at the high_school before parents . Principal Kathleen Clark ordered the piece canceled after seeing the dance for the first time earlier in the day during a performance for students and several guests . She said later that the dance was &quot; inflammatory and totally inappropriate &quot; and that it violated students ' privacy . The 11-minute piece , titled &quot; In Search . . . My Journey , &quot; combines narration with movements expressing isolation and rage . The dancers are accompanied by a montage of modern instrumental music . Roble , an 11th-grader from Hawthorne , said the piece draws from many experiences that have left her afraid and angry . &quot; I can ' t see justification for this dance to be censored , &quot; she said . Roble ' s dance teacher at the high_school , Ming Ng , also said the principal ' s decision amounted to censorship . She said a work_of_art should not be banned just because someone disagrees_with an artist ' s interpretation . The dance is performed by two boys and two girls , who interact through movement , much of it confrontational . At several points , a boy makes thrusting and striking gestures over one of the girls , who falls to the floor and resists . The narration includes cries of protest and calls_for help . &quot; I was cold and shaking and trembling , trembling , &quot; the narrator says at one point . &quot; I said , ' No , no , no. ' &quot; Then later : &quot; I yelled , then I screamed . I said , ' No , please , no , please ! ' No one heard me , so I screamed a little bit louder : ' No ! ' But not a sound . I was paralyzed . . . too weak to think. &quot; Some students laughed , cheered or whooped during the morning performance at the high_school . The audience applauded warmly at the conclusion . Principal Clark summoned the performers to her office and told them that the piece would not be performed before parents at the annual public recital for the high_school ' s dance program . She said in an interview that she objected to the dance because it alluded to a violent act that may have actually taken_place involving students . As a result , some parents might become angry or upset if they saw it , she said . Roble , five other students and a dancer ' s parent then complained to the Long_Beach school_board , which oversees the Carson academy . The school draws students from Long_Beach and seven other area school_systems . The principal ' s &quot; decision to omit this piece not only gives new meaning to the words hysteria and paranoia , but also clearly violates Desiree ' s 1st Amendment rights , &quot; said Gail Murray , the parent of Jamal Story , one of the dancers . Board_members referred the issue to staff , which is still trying to sort_out the_matter , said Helen Z . Hansen , superintendent of the district ' s high_schools . Last week , however , the students won a reprieve from an unexpected source . Sharon Collins-Heads , a dance instructor at Los Angeles Southwest College , invited the students to fill_in for another group at this weekend ' s &quot; Dance Jam ' 94 , &quot; a concert featuring dancers from five area community_colleges . The concert is at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday at the South Bay Center for the Arts on the El Camino campus , 16007 Crenshaw Blvd. , Torrance . Collins-Heads was a guest of one of the dancers at the original performance of Roble ' s work . To her , the work represented a girl ' s numbing expression of outrage and pain over being abused . Clark has given the students her blessing to perform at El Camino -- as long as they don ' t mention the high_school . The students have agreed . Off campus , Clark said , the dance &quot; becomes more or less a generic statement about an issue -- a social issue. &quot; that ' s all_the piece ever was , said Roble , who wants to become a professional dancer and choreographer . She added that she choreographed the piece &quot; basically to make me and my dancers look good and to show the audience that a lot of creativity was involved. &quot;</TEXT>
