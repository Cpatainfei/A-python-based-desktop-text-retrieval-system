   <HEADLINE> SPEED_DEMON ; NEXT WEEK AT THE INDY 500 , ROBBY GORDON WILL BE RACING AGAINST THE BEST IN THE WORLD -- AND HIS OWN REPUTATION FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> SCREAMING DOWN SHORELINE DRIVE IN HIS REGAL BLUE VALVOLINE LOLA-FORD race_car at three times the national speed_limit , Robby Gordon all but pounds on the steering_wheel in frustration . Italian driver Teo Fabi , in the bright yellow Pennzoil-sponsored car , is blocking his path . With the Toyota Grand Prix of Long_Beach just laps from the finish , Gordon is sitting safely in third place , but every nerve ending in his body is telling him he can catch the leaders , Al Unser Jr . and Nigel Mansell , who are within sight , just beyond Fabi . Gordon knows he should be able to leapfrog a back-marker like Fabi . After all , he qualified seven places ahead of the Italian , who is now a lap behind . The problem is , Gordon ' s car is seriously down on power , so instead of being able to pass Fabi easily on the straightaway , he ' ll have to try to take him on the twisty back side of the Long_Beach course . In the dangerous curves , driving skill can compensate for lack of power . &quot; Take_it_easy , &quot; comes the radioed order from Valvoline team owner and manager Derrick Walker as Gordon flashes by the_pits . &quot; Pace it. &quot; In previous years , Robby Gordon might have ignored such advice and followed his instincts , risking everything trying to pass in the curves . In 1993 , his first full year in Indy car_racing , a similar maneuver here at Long_Beach landed him on the sidelines , disqualified for deliberately crashing into another car after they came_together on the same curve . Which set the tone for Gordon ' s season . That DQ for rough driving -- virtually unheard of in a sport where rubbed wheels and swapped paint are everyday occurrences -- combined with nine accidents in his first six races . By midseason the rookie had gone from &quot; Flash &quot; Gordon , the fair-haired boy of Indy car_racing , to &quot; Crash &quot; Gordon . No one doubted he was fast , the question was , could he ever learn to control it ? What a difference a year makes . With 85 # 000 fans lining Shoreline Drive , straining against the catch fences , waiting for the pass , Gordon makes a non -move . In front of him , it ' s clear that Fabi is in his own battle with another driver and could easily miss seeing Gordon ' s go-around attempt . It isn ' t hard to imagine a crackup -- Fabi punting Gordon into the course-side tire barriers or another car -- and Robby Gordon risking life and limb while blowing another race . So Gordon swallows his frustration . When he hears Walker ' s gravelly , Scots-accented voice say &quot; pace it &quot; over the two-way radio , he does just that , reining himself in and holding_on for a respectable finish . In the_pits , Walker ' s stiff jaw relaxes into a smile . GRAND PRIX SUNDAY DAWNED CHILLY AND OVERCAST IN LONG_BEACH , but by the time Gordon jumped up_on the three-tiered podium last month to accept his third-place award , the marine layer had rolled back to reveal resplendent late-afternoon sun . With the winner , Unser , and second-place finisher Mansell , Gordon accepted the accolades of the crowd and spent nearly a quarter of an hour taking_off and putting_on sponsor hats for photographers from around the world . It was his first podium finish of the year , and it was doubly sweet : As an Orange County kid , not only was it nice to finish well before the hometown crowd , but it helped to make_up for last year ' s defeat . &quot; I ' m the worst loser of them all , &quot; Gordon readily admits the next day , at his race shop in an Anaheim industrial_park , close to Disneyland and the Big A . &quot; You show me a good loser and I ' ll show you a loser. &quot; But now , at the age of 25 , he says he understands that there ' s losing and there ' s losing . His day in Long_Beach began with the discovery that his car was running slow ( a valve problem it turned_out ) . So from the start , he and Walker were determined to pace the race , counting_on the action coming_back to Gordon as the faster runners burned themselves out over the course of the 166-mile event . Even though he was tempted to change that game_plan , Gordon opted to win by losing : &quot; I wanted to pass Fabi , &quot; he says , complaining that Walker had him driving at 75 % capacity by the end , &quot; but it would have meant a chance at missing the podium finish , so I didn ' t. &quot; Gordon has hoisted himself up onto a counter in the immaculate shop . Across from him , a team of mechanics is working_on a gleaming desert-racing truck that he will be driving this year when he isn ' t taking_care of his Indy car duties . Sandy-haired and movie-star handsome , Gordon smiles a lot . For all his brashness , he ' s almost shy , and when it comes_to talking_about his 1993 season , he puts_on a sheepish look . He knows that he has to live_down a rambunctious reputation . &quot; You can ' t finish first if you don ' t first finish &quot; goes an old racing saw . Gordon laughs : &quot; I ' ve heard it a_thousand times over the last year. &quot; To be fair , disappointment over Gordon ' s results last year can be traced in part to impossible expectations and an overload of pressure . The hype surrounding him has been intense , and more_than slightly jingoistic . The idea is that Gordon , who has been a dominant force in off-road racing since his debut at age 16 , will reinvigorate U.S. hopes on the Indy car circuit , a 16-stop series that includes the Indy 500 and the race in Long_Beach . Indy cars -- 900-horsepower , lightweight , open-wheel racers -- have long symbolized U.S. industrial know-how . And the Indianapolis 500 , the cars ' signature race , remains the world ' s single most-watched automotive event ; it is the fastest ( speeds average more_than 220 m.p.h. ) and most prestigious car_race in the world . But Indy cars and even the 500 have taken_on an international flavor . Next week , for example , Ford will be the only U.S. automobile manufacturer competing at Indianapolis , and it is facing incipient challenges from Mercedes , which is returning to Indy competition for the first time since 1915 , as well as Honda and Toyota . Foreign sponsors and drivers will abound . At Long_Beach this year , the warm-up event for the 500 , 12 of the first 16 drivers were born outside the United States ; Gordon alone represented new American talent near the head of the field ( the other top Americans , Unser Jr . and Michael Andretti are veterans ) . Gordon wasn ' t shy about playing to his image as the great American hope . Before he had ever won an Indy car_race , he named himself among the top five drivers on the circuit . And early in 1993 , it seemed as though he might actually live_up_to that assessment . The year before , his best finishes had been twin eighths , in Toronto and Cleveland . Over the winter , Gordon signed_on with the racing team led by legendary four-time 500 winner A.J. Foyt . In the 1993 Indy car opener , the Surfer ' s Paradise Grand Prix in Australia , he placed third behind two former world champions , Mansell and Emerson Fittipaldi . But then came Long_Beach . Today , Gordon says he was simply following Foyt ' s orders when he drew the disqualification for running Eddie Cheever off the track . Cheever had cut_off Gordon at the sharp turn from Shoreline , knocking him out of contention for a podium finish . Foyt , considered to be the most pugnacious driver of the modern Indy era , apparently told Gordon at a pit stop to deliver a pay-back and , according to Gordon , who never denied that the move was intentional , he performed as instructed . The events at Long_Beach might have been forgotten , if it hadn ' t been for what happened next in Indianapolis . During the weeks of training and hype that traditionally precede the 500 , Gordon was at best inconsistent . He posted the seventh-fastest time around the oval , but he also cracked_up several of his cars . In a very public dressing_down , Foyt , who was driving_in the race as well as running his team , ordered him off the track for a three-day cooling-off period . ( When it was pointed_out to Foyt that Gordon ' s style perfectly matched his own , Foyt was heard to mumble that it was OK for him to crack_up half-million-dollar cars ; after all , he owned them. ) Gordon started 25th at Indianapolis and finished 27th . And his next few races were again marred by crashes . He finished_out the season quietly , making only about $ 800 # 000 -- big-money winners in Indy car_racing make upward of $ 3 million -- and it was clear that Foyt was not going_to renew his contract . By then , Gordon ' s Darth Vader-like image was as well cemented as his potential . An ad appeared showing the other rising star of Indy car_racing , Canadian Paul Tracy , in his white Penske car with Gordon ' s menacing black Ford bearing_down_on him . The copy line read : &quot; Never has the future of Indy car_racing been so black and white. &quot; Gordon insists that despite the DQ , the crashes and Foyt ' s displeasure , the bad-boy image was simple misapprehension . The criticism &quot; won ' t change my style , &quot; he says , &quot; but it will teach me to be a little more cautious , to pay more attention to the big picture &quot; -- winning the Indy car championship and , eventually , the Indy 500 itself . &quot; Last year , I got a reputation for crashing , &quot; he says ruefully . &quot; I got this reputation from people who don ' t know me at all. &quot; AS HIS MOM , MARLENE , REMEMBERS IT , GORDON COULDN ' T WAIT TO GO fast , even as a kid . &quot; At Christmas , 1970 , when he was 11 months old , we got him a little electric_car to ride_on , &quot; she says , standing outside her Robby Gordon paraphernalia trailer at the Long_Beach race . &quot; The problem was that his foot couldn ' t reach the pedal . We had to tape the gas_pedal down before he was happy. &quot; By his second birthday , Robby desperately wanted a kid-sized electric motorbike -- which his parents refused until he came_up with a compromise : He would stop sucking his thumb if he got one . Laughs Marlene : &quot; Of course , he went_back to sucking his thumb the minute he got the motorcycle. &quot; Shortly thereafter the Gordons , who then lived_in Lakewood , got a call from the police -- their son had been terrorizing a neighbor ' s petunias . &quot; I would ride up and down the streets , on the sidewalks , everywhere , &quot; Gordon told a reporter in 1989 . &quot; The police took me to the station and would n ' t let me go until my dad came and signed for me. &quot; By age 8 , Gordon , whose father is prominent Southern California off-road racer Bob Gordon , was racing motorcyles competitively ; by 10 , gasoline-powered minibikes . It wasn ' t a case of ego-driven parents pushing a child into something he wasn ' t ready for . While the entire family is almost impossibly white_bread -- these are the people East Coasters hate us for , the perfect postwar suburban family , the father with the granite-chinned face , the mother with the grace of Donna Reed -- neither parent wanted him to follow in his father ' s footsteps . Or his great-grandfather ' s , for that matter -- Robby ' s father ' s grandfather once held the San Francisco-to-L.A. racing record . His father tried to interest Robby in sports like baseball ( a world champion Connie Mack-league pitcher , Bob Gordon was a Little_League coach ) or football ( Robby , built with a defensive back ' s powerful shoulders and thin hips , played one season at Orange ' s El Modena High ) -- while his mother pressed academics ( &quot; His main interest seems to be racing_cars , &quot; his first-grade teacher wrote_on his report_card ) . Robby even managed to turn the family_business to an advantage -- Bob runs a thoroughbred feed business , supplying Southern California race tracks from Santa Anita to Del Mar . While the business is based in Los Alamitos , the feed itself is grown several hours away near the Mexican border in the Imperial Valley . There Robby would go every season to help with the hay harvest . And while the desert sun made_it too hot to bale during the day , Robby would work all night with the laborers in the fields and ride his dirt bike all day . It paid_off when , at age 13 , he finished second at the world minibike grand_prix in Ponca City , Okla . Finally , after Robby broke too many bones on his motorcycle , his dad gave_up and let him drive a race_car -- a dune buggy . At 16 , an age when most teen-agers are worried about passing their road_test , Robby Gordon won the first race he entered , the Nevada 500 , against competitors more_than twice his age . In an off-road truck less than two weeks later , he won his second , a Mickey Thompson stadium race , named after the late Southern California Indy car racer and world land-speed record holder who first put off-road truck racing into stadiums like Anaheim , the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl . By 19 , Robby had been discovered , first by Toyota , which hired him to drive its stadium-racing trucks , and then by Ford for its desert-racing division . Along the way , he managed to rewrite some rules -- that season , the Toyota team won seven of eight races and &quot; they couldn ' t come_up with any way to keep us from winning , &quot; he says today . &quot; They did everything they could , including changing the rules halfway through the season. &quot; Among the new rules : An inverted starting order , meaning the fastest qualifiers had to start in the back . That was the beginning of Gordon ' s reputation for dirty driving -- with only 12 laps in the short stadium heats , he had no choice but to push his way to the front as fast as he could , even if it meant elbowing more experienced drivers out of the way . As Walker Evans , the dean of off-road racing , told The Times in 1989 : &quot; He ' s leaned_on a lot of guys and that doesn ' t sit too well with his competitors. &quot; On the other hand , he admitted , &quot; he ' s talented and knows how to get_to the front . You can ' t take that away from him. &quot; A lot of observers who have looked_at Gordon ' s fast rise in truck racing -- and beyond -- called him lucky . With his family background , they say , he had it easy . Gordon doesn ' t agree -- his father made him earn every penny he spent on his racing_cars and he passed_up a normal teen-age lifestyle to pursue his racing career . &quot; I must have missed out on a bunch of good parties , &quot; he says , laughing . &quot; While my friends were out screwing around , we were either at a race , going_to a race or coming from a race. &quot; After he graduated from high_school , Ford invited him to test its new racing sports_car with an eye toward having him join its 1990 endurance racing team . Of the eight or nine drivers tried_out , he was the only one with no pavement racing experience . Yet he was by far the fastest of them . Not only did Ford sign him up for its endurance races -- Gordon has since won four Daytona 24-hour races in a row -- but Roush Racing , Ford ' s International Motor Sports Assn . team , signed him to drive its sports_cars for the entire road-racing season . By far his most impressive performance that year was an amazing same-day victory in the off-road Baja 1000 and the IMSA finale at Del Mar . Under contract with Ford for desert racing , Gordon felt obligated to compete in both races . Fortunately for Gordon , the desert race started the day before the IMSA . After driving 17 hours to win the Baja 1000 , at 6 Saturday morning , he drove 80 miles from race headquarters in Ensenada back to the border , arriving in Del Mar about 9:30 a.m. He drove a 15-minute warm-up , took a nap and woke just before the race . He started in the sixth position , and 46 laps later he had beaten the sports car-series champion Pete Halmser . It was_after yet another win at Del Mar the next year , as well as additional IMSA victories , that he finally attracted attention from the big boys of car racing . Chip Ganassi , a team owner whose drivers have been top racers for years , invited him onto his team in 1992 , and Gordon became one of the few young racers to successfully negotiate the distance from motocross to desert truck events to sports_cars on pavement to automobile_racing ' s big_time . Ask Robby Gordon the secret of his success and he ' ll tell you it ' s simple competitiveness -- he hates to lose and seldom has . His live-in girlfriend , Inge Stikbakke , a former Norwegian beauty queen who met Gordon when she handed him his trophy at Del Mar in 1992 , calls that quite the understatement . On the way home from the race shop in Anaheim , she says , Gordon used to stop at a nearby video arcade . He had run_into an elderly gentleman there and consistently lost to him in a video racing game . &quot; Robby could not beat the guy and it ticked him off , &quot; Stikbakke says . He started getting home later and later , putting_in practice time perfecting his moves . Finally , after days of pumping quarter after quarter into the video machines , Gordon whipped the old gent , and the real-time racer emerged victorious in cyberspace , too . PHOENIX INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY LIES HARD AGAINST THE LOW SCRUB mountains that surround the city . Just outside the racetrack gates is the Fleming Thoroughbred Farm , home to more_than 100 horses . Most days , the farm ' s co-owner , Marv Fleming , can hear the sound of the turbocharged Indy car engines bouncing off the mountains as he takes his horses on lap after workout lap . &quot; Horse_racing is all mental , &quot; says Fleming . &quot; There are horses that just want to burst_out of the gate and run as fast as they can , but they ' re done_in half a mile . You ' ve got_to ' rate ' them , teach them to go_for the win. &quot; Inside the raceway gates , Derrick Walker is proving that horse_racing and car_racing have much in common . It is early April , just weeks before the 1994 Long_Beach Grand Prix , and Walker is &quot; rating &quot; Gordon . Walker , 49 , started in racing as a mechanic , graduated to leading teams for Roger Penske , champion driver turned millionaire racing sponsor , and then in 1991 , went_out on_his_own as a team owner and manager . In his time , Walker has helped bring along such Indy champions as Rick Mears ( another driver who came_up from Southern California desert racing ) , Teo Fabi and Danny Sullivan . For Gordon in particular , it ' s been a long learning process . &quot; It ' s a big jump from off-road racing or sports_cars up_to Indy cars , &quot; says Walker . Gordon himself offers_up a Zen-like definition of Walker ' s tutelage : &quot; I ' ve always been fast , &quot; he says proudly . &quot; Now I ' m learning how to go fast. &quot; Some might say that it was once again a matter of luck that got Gordon back in an Indy car with a mentor like Derrick Walker . After 1993 , it was clear that Gordon ' s one-year contract with Foyt ' s team would not be renewed . But then Al Unser Jr. , who had raced for years under a Valvoline sponsorship , got another offer and left his contract behind . Valvoline , a subsidiary of Ashland Oil that pours up_to $ 10 million a year into Indy racing , began to look_for a successor . Its search came_down to two drivers -- rookie Gordon and Canadian Scott Goodyear . Goodyear had it all_over Gordon in terms of experience , but , says Valvoline spokesman Mark Coughlin , it didn ' t hurt &quot; that Gordon was an American. &quot; When Valvoline signed with Gordon , Gordon -- and his Valvoline money -- signed with Walker . In 1993 , Gordon had gotten_in about a half-day ' s practice before the Phoenix race . This year , Walker has him running flat out around the track for four full days , experimenting with suspension settings and getting that all-important &quot; seat time &quot; that drivers talk_about . Standing behind the_pit wall as his young charge cracks out 190 m.p.h. laps , Walker says Gordon must forget about the naysayers and the pressure . &quot; If he can harness his natural capabilities , &quot; Walker says , &quot; he ' s going_to be one of the great drivers of Indy car racing . But it ' s not automatic . He ' s going_to have to work for it . As an Indy car driver , he ' s just at Day One ; he ' s got a lot of racing to do . The real question for Robby Gordon is not how great he will be , but how he controls his emotions . &quot; Learning to win at this level is what Robby ' s got_to do -- that ' s the difference between a fast driver and a great driver , &quot; says Walker . &quot; What we ' re looking_for now is consistency. &quot; WITH THE INDIANAPOLIS 500 just a week away , both Walker and Gordon are feeling positive . In Australia in March , Gordon was running third until mechanical problems caused him to spin_out and knocked him out of the competition . At Phoenix , the second race in the 1994 lineup and the short-term focus of all those practice laps , Gordon was in_the_lead before an error by his refueling team cost him seven positions . Then the podium finish in Long_Beach came as a kind of graduation ceremony . As the announcer said before handing Gordon his trophy , &quot; It ' s a ways from desert trucks to Indy cars , but this guy has made the quantum leap. &quot; Robby Gordon ' s biggest test will come next weekend at Indianapolis , when he finds_out if he can maintain his momentum against the world ' s finest . Taking the microphone at Long_Beach , Gordon displayed the new-found maturity his fans might see again at the 500 : &quot; We played it cautious today . We ' re looking_forward to going_to Indianapolis. &quot; But don ' t expect him to play it too cautious there . &quot; I ' ve been a winner at everything I ' ve tried , &quot; he says . &quot; If I can ' t win at Indy cars , I ' ll have to find something else to do. &quot;</TEXT>
