   <TEXT> Painter Leslie Sayour likes to splash color across big canvases when she paints . But Japanese consumers , who pay as much as $ 55 # 000 for her impressionistic oil_paintings , want art that fits into their small homes . So Sayour , who sells most of her work in Japan , takes her paintings to Kolibri Art Studio in Torrance , where Herta Hedrick uses a painstaking printing technique called serigraphy to reproduce the designs in smaller sizes . The prints , valued between $ 2 # 500 and $ 3 # 500 , look so_much like an original painting that it can be hard to tell the two apart . Typically artists request 200 to 500 copies of each work . Since the studio opened at 2908 Oregon Court 3 1 / 2 years ago , it has reproduced about 55 works . Only about five studios in the Los Angeles area do fine-art serigraph printing . Serigraphers separate and print each color_in a painting . For brightly colored works such_as Sayour ' s , each print passes_through the press more_than 100 times . The layers of ink coat the canvas and combine colors to duplicate the effects created by an oil_painter . Special overlays of web-like black lines imitate the artist ' s brush strokes . Five artists work full time for Hedrick to separate the colors . It takes_up to three months to complete a reproduction . Because of the hour it takes_to set_up the machine and the time it takes_to dry , only about three colors can be put_on each day . Hedrick said the hardest part of her business is finding workers patient enough to endure the handiwork who also have an artistic sense . It takes technical skills and a good eye to do the work well . &quot; Just to be an artist is almost too imaginative and creative , &quot; Hedrick said . &quot; It ' s just so_much discipline. &quot; For each color , Hedrick ' s artists black_out portions of a transparent sheet , which is then used to make the plate that goes_on the press . They rely_on their own color sense to differentiate between similar tones on the canvas . The workers also mix the ink to exactly match the original . Running the press takes equal skill . Each print must be placed in the printer exactly right or the colors won ' t end_up in the right place . The process is so exacting that even a Santa Ana wind causing a drop_in humidity can shrink the paper enough to ruin the run . Finding ways to duplicate each artist ' s style keeps the work interesting , Hedrick said . &quot; If I had my choice I would love to work with one artist and really perfect his work , &quot; she said . Sayour said that sometimes the copies of her work outshine her originals . &quot; If I ever notice differences , it ' s always for the better. &quot;</TEXT>
