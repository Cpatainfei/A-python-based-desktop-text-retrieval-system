   <HEADLINE> MTA STRIKE ' S 2ND DAY GOES BY THE RULES ; LABOR : UNION_MEMBERS BLOCK VEHICLES AT SUN VALLEY BUS_DEPOT . BUT THE ROUTE DELAYS ARE RESTRICTED TO FOUR MINUTES EACH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Everyone seemed to have a rough idea of the rules : The strikers agreed to hold_up departing buses for four minutes , no more , no less . The supervisors who had replaced them in the driver ' s seats waited patiently , joking with the strikers before getting permission to move_on . And police kept their distance , choosing the comfort of their air-conditioned squad_cars . &quot; We don ' t really mind ; we understand the situation , &quot; said a smiling supervisor , who was filling_in as a driver . &quot; All we ' re trying to do is to detain them a little , &quot; said a grinning Robert Blackwood , a striking bus mechanic . &quot; They understand what we have to do. &quot; &quot; We ' re just here to make_sure everything goes smoothly , &quot; Los Angeles Police_Officer Todd Trulock said with a shrug . And so it went at a picket_line at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s Sun Valley bus_depot Tuesday -- the second day of a strike against the agency by its mechanics , which is also being honored by drivers and clerks . During a day when all suffered under the same hot sun , there was a strange camaraderie between the 40 or so strikers and their bosses -- even as union_members tried to block buses by standing_in front of them for as long as possible , while their bosses wanted nothing more_than to get_to their routes . &quot; We were holding them up for seven or 10 minutes earlier this morning , &quot; said Blackwood , who made_sure that the drivers knew the holdup was not personal by bidding each of them a good_day . &quot; But they ( the police ) cut it to about four. &quot; Sometimes , though , the agreed-upon four-minute delay actually stretched to a quarter of an hour without anyone seeming to notice . While waiting for cars and buses to block , the strikers talked_about their greatest concern : the MTA ' s growing reliance on subcontracting duties that union_members had previously performed . Their other big worry is that the public perceives them as overpaid and spoiled . &quot; ( The MTA ) says we ' re in a hole , &quot; bus_driver and shop_steward Ed Hanger said . &quot; But hey , we didn ' t do_it . We didn ' t tell them to put all their money in rail and . . . spend thousands of dollars on newspaper_ads attacking the union. &quot; Added Steve Patterson , an MTA service attendant : &quot; They ' re trying to balance their budget on the backs of guys making $ 30 # 000 or $ 40 # 000 a year . Why not start the cost-cutting at the top ? &quot; While the strikers remained mostly good-natured on their second day out , occasionally they applied the heat . &quot; You are crossing the picket_line , and we ' ve asked you not to , &quot; Dane Sheldon , an executive board_member of the striking Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1277 , said as a substitute driver tried to exit the bus yard . &quot; You don ' t have anything to lose here ? &quot; After the driver turned_away , Sheldon backed_off . &quot; I was pushing it a little , huh ? &quot; he asked sheepishly . By late morning , they were told that a Los Angeles police_captain had surveyed their strike line and was unhappy about it . &quot; He said what we are doing is illegal , &quot; Sheldon informed the group . &quot; We need to walk a line , or he ' s going_to arrest somebody for blocking the street. &quot; So the strikers started walking back and forth , causing largely the same result : No cars or buses could come_in or out of the bus yard without waiting four minutes -- or thereabouts . Meanwhile , outside the San Fernando Valley ' s other MTA depot , in Chatsworth , there was precious little goodwill Tuesday afternoon . Because the MTA wasn ' t driving any buses out of that yard , a dozen strikers -- including drivers , mechanics and clerks -- had plenty of time to fume . The drivers said stress is unavoidable in their profession , with its tight schedules , complaining passengers and the occasional armed motorist aiming a gun at an MTA driver . Some said they were angry enough to vote against the tentative agreement that the driver ' s union reached last week . &quot; You give me another choice for a job and , if I make the same money , I ' ll be flying out of there , &quot; said Guillermo Munoz , a driver for 14 years . &quot; We get no respect , and we ' ve had it. &quot; Valley Emergency Bus_Routes For the duration of the strike , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has established emergency service on seven of the San Fernando Valley ' s busiest routes . There are fewer buses on those lines , however , and MTA officials cautioned passengers to expect to wait twice as long as usual between buses . For example , they said , if a bus normally reaches a particular stop every 20 minutes , buses on the emergency lines will probably arrive up_to 40 minutes apart . The buses also run_shorter hours , from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. only . All buses on the Valley routes are free except those on the Van Nuys Boulevard line , which cost 50 cents .
