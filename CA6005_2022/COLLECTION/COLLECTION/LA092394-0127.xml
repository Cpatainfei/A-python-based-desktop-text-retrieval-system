   <HEADLINE> NEW STUDY ON IMMIGRATION CITES HIGH COST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Legal and illegal immigration are more costly for large states such_as California than recently estimated by the Clinton_Administration , according to a new study . A report by the respected Center for Immigration Studies , a Washington-based think_tank , said Thursday that immigrants in 1992 produced a net national deficit of $ 29.1 billion , borne mainly by California and six other states . The center compared the cost of social_services and education against taxes and fees paid by immigrants to come_up with the deficit . This estimate contrasts with a finding by the Urban Institute , in an Administration-commissioned study , that immigrants had in fact brought the United States a net benefit of $ 28.7 billion . However , the institute acknowledged that it costs California $ 1.28 billion annually to pay_for the education of illegal immigrant children . While adding fuel to the debate over illegal immigrants , the report by the generally conservative Center for Immigration Studies provided no cost estimate of California ' s burden or that of any other individual state . Statistics compiled by the White House-commissioned study showed California and six other states -- Florida , Texas , New York , Illinois , Arizona and New Jersey -- spending more money on federally mandated programs than was collected in taxes from the overwhelmingly young and poor population of illegal immigrants , which the study estimated at 3.4 million nationwide as of October , 1992 . But the center ' s report said the Urban Institute ' s estimate of about 15.1 million foreign-born residents -- both legal and illegal -- is &quot; overly conservative. &quot; &quot; It sticks closely to census numbers , but unlike the Census_Bureau , is not prepared to acknowledge an undercount that is especially high in the populations targeted in these studies , &quot; the report said . The center estimated the total foreign-born population of the nation at 22 million in mid-1992 , or about 7 million more_than the institute ' s figure . This gap makes_it possible for some analysts to reduce costs associated with illegal immigrants by several billion dollars , the center said . It said the institute also inflated tax_revenues accruing from immigrant workers . The institute ' s estimates that the immigrant population contributes $ 24.2 billion in Social_Security taxes and $ 9.28 billion in unemployment taxes and other levies is about $ 6.8 billion too high , the center said . David Simcox , who helped author the report , said California &quot; clearly bears the heaviest burden of all_the states . It has more illegal aliens than other states , and on the whole they tend to be less educated . In addition , California is very generous with its social services. &quot; George High , the center ' s executive_director , told a news briefing , &quot; This study is helpful to states because it shows that immigrants , indeed , are costly. &quot; The report said that &quot; until recently , conventional wisdom had it that immigrants in_general were an economic boon to the host country . That wisdom has been challenged in lawsuits filed by California , Florida , Texas and other states , which effectively serve the federal_government with a bill for hosting immigrants. &quot; &quot; Those legal processes are founded on the premise that immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- and their offspring are costly to provide with education , medical coverage and other benefits of our extensive social safety net. &quot; California Gov . Pete Wilson , in a series of high-profile challenges to the Clinton_Administration ' s handling of illegal immigrants , has estimated that they cost the state $ 3.4 billion annually but pay only $ 739 million in taxes . Wilson ' s office has concluded that the average illegal immigrant household receives $ 7 # 760 in government services each year . To cover the costs of such services , the average household would have to earn $ 100 # 000 , he has said . Wilson has pushed for passage of Proposition 187 , a November state ballot measure that would deny most government services to illegal immigrants . Tracing the roots of the controversy , the report said : &quot; Stubborn high welfare dependency among refugees coming since the 1970s was recognized in the 1980s in congressional hearings and by the Department of Health and Human Services . But state_governments did not make a major issue of it until the federal_government began shifting much of the burden of public assistance to them in the late 1980s. &quot; But it complimented Los Angeles County for its attention to the situation , noting that &quot; during the 1980s , the office of the county administrator regularly compiled the rising costs of such services ( to immigrants ) as indigent medical_care , Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Medicaid to illegal aliens. &quot;</TEXT>
