   <HEADLINE> COUNTY DELIVERS AN URGENT PLEA FOR BLOOD DONATIONS ; HEALTH : SUPPLIES ARE SO LOW THAT ELECTIVE SURGERIES COULD BE CANCELED , OFFICIALS WARN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rows of empty shelves have prompted Ventura County health officials to issue an urgent call_for blood donations . Officials at United Blood Services , the nonprofit agency that delivers blood to medical_centers across the county , said Monday that supplies are so low that elective surgeries may be canceled . &quot; We just don ' t have enough blood on the shelves , &quot; said Patricia Hunt , who coordinates blood deliveries from United . &quot; We ' re running to take blood from one hospital to another , and then running back to fill the first hospital from the blood coming_out of the lab that day , &quot; she said . Hunt said her agency needs 100 or more pint-sized donations each day just to stay even with the demand in Ventura County . However , she said , the blood_bank is already more_than 300 pints below normal reserves . The blood-supply center fell even further behind on Monday , drawing just 90 donations from its offices and bloodmobile . &quot; If we can ' t generate support from the community and the donors , the next step is to start canceling elective surgeries , &quot; said Hunt , who predicted that such a move is only weeks away if the slump continues . A post-holiday shortage is not unexpected , officials said . But so far this month there have been even fewer donors than in winters past . &quot; January is a notoriously high usage month , because people typically put their surgeries off until after the holidays , &quot; said Carolyn Tyner , associate executive_director at United Blood Services . Because of illness or over-drinking by donors , the number of unfit donors and unusable donations also rises this time_of_year , she said . &quot; I had a woman in today who wanted to donate , but she had a small cough , &quot; Tyner said . &quot; I had to send her away. &quot; The would-be donor , Judy Johnson of Oxnard , said she would return to donate blood as soon as she was over her cold . &quot; I am a rare blood-type , and there is a need , &quot; said Johnson , an A-negative . The United Blood Services ' call Monday echoed a similar plea by American Red_Cross officials , who said last week that supplies were lower than expected across the country . The Red_Cross collects and delivers roughly half of the blood supply in the United States , although not in Ventura County . * Ventura auto mechanic Randy Gaumond heard about the shortage over the weekend . First thing Monday , he was at the United Blood Services office in Ventura with his shirt sleeve rolled_up . &quot; My best_friend ' s dad needed blood for an operation back when I was 18 , &quot; said Gaumond , 38 . &quot; I ' ve been doing_it ever since . I ' ve probably given_away several gallons by now. &quot; Hospital administrators said Monday the low blood supply was a concern , but it had not yet hurt medical services . &quot; This year is really bad , &quot; said Daniel Zia , the blood_bank supervisor at Los Robles Regional Medical_Center in Thousand Oaks . For instance , Zia said , Los Robles on Monday had just four units of O-negative blood on its shelves -- less than half the normal reserve . &quot; In every inventory they are below their par level , &quot; Zia said . &quot; Even though they are able to supply us , if we have a bleeder , they ' ll use_up all_of their reserves. &quot; FYI United Blood Services has offices in Thousand Oaks , Simi Valley and Ventura as well as a roving bloodmobile . To donate blood , call 654-8104 . Donors face no health risk because every instrument used is disposable , officials said . The donated blood is put_through an extensive series of tests to make_sure it is safe for the recipient .</TEXT>
