   <HEADLINE> HELPING CONSERVATION TAKE_ROOT IN RAIN_FOREST ; BIOLOGY : VISITING BRAZILIAN HOPES TO SET_UP VOLUNTEER AND PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN JUNGLE SIMILAR TO THOSE SHE WITNESSED ON CHANNEL ISLANDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The often dry and wind-swept landscapes of the Channel Islands seem an unlikely training ground for a woman charged with protecting the lush rain_forests of eastern Brazil . But through an exchange program hosted by wildlife biologists in Ventura , Maria Elisa Castellanos Sola will take_home valuable tips to help her manage the endangered and disappearing jungles in the state of Minas Gerais . Sola , who is nicknamed Sandy , is at once excited and intensely serious as she talks_about her plans to set_up volunteer and public education programs like the ones she saw here . On Santa Cruz Island , she saw high_school students working as volunteers in a summer program with the Nature Conservancy to repair fences , rid the island of non-native plants and do general maintenance . Each evening , the groups of students prepared a short presentation on the work they did that day , and the issues it involved . &quot; While these children are doing this hard work , they are also learning about the environment , &quot; Sola said . &quot; When you have kids working with preservation , you teach them something they could not learn in a classroom . It was really beautiful to see this. &quot; That combination of teaching and tapping the potentially vast network of free energy through volunteers will turn_into a similar program in Brazil , she said . &quot; This is my plan to have a program like this , this year , &quot; she said . Sola is one of two scientists from Latin_America chosen to come_to Ventura County this year as part of a program aimed at exchanging information and experiences , learning from North_American mistakes and profiting from successes . The eight-week course was conceived by Marc Weitzel , a Ventura-based U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who counts leading the California_condor recovery team among his duties . The program is funded by Fish and Wildlife ' s Office of International Affairs . Eventually , the 2-year-old program will send U.S. scientists to Latin_America to learn from that region ' s experience as well . &quot; We have to think_of protecting natural_resources in a global context , &quot; Weitzel said . The air and water that are cleansed and purified by the rain_forests of Brazil are important to the entire region , he said . &quot; One could look_at the entire Western_Hemisphere as a single ecosystem. &quot; Migratory birds , which spend many months of the year in Ventura County , spend their winters in Central and South_America . &quot; Natural_resources do not respect political boundaries , &quot; he said . To protect endangered species in California , their habitats in Latin_America must also be preserved , he said . In Ventura County , Sola visited the Hopper Mountain Wildlife Refuge , where biologists lived during the first months that the endangered California_condors were reintroduced to the wild in the nearby Sespe Condor Sanctuary . She also spent a_few days with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary staff , visiting Santa Cruz Island . She said she found some similarities in the problems involving ranching on the Channel Islands and in Brazil . In both places , introducing animals that are domestically bred for human consumption damages the environment . On the islands , the animals destroy native grasses and shrubs with grazing and in Brazil the ranchers cut_down the forest to make_way for pastures for grazing or , in some areas , coal mining . The farmers there are_on contract with large companies that own the land , she said . &quot; They are very poor people who go inside the forest to cut for the industry , &quot; she said . &quot; They do not know what they are allowed to do and the industry does not tell them. &quot; It is her task to educate them , helping them understand the law and why it is important to protect the waterways and hillsides . &quot; On the island , the problems are not what the farmer does not know , &quot; she said . &quot; It is more of a management problem. &quot; Ranching is still allowed on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands until the property can be acquired by the National_Park_Service or until leases run_out . In Minas Gerais , which is considered more advanced than the rest of Brazil in its environmental laws , landowners must set_aside 20 % of their property to remain wild . That segment is chosen by the government so the state will always have contiguous wild areas . In addition , all_of the watershed is protected . &quot; The rivers and lakes are owned by the federation , &quot; Sola said . She gave slide presentations on the programs that her institute operates . Sola said she takes_home a wealth of ideas that she is eager to put into place . She looks_to the strong models she saw here as a means to marry the people with the conservation goals of her agency . &quot; The real origin of our problems is that we did not consider ourselves and our culture as part of the environment , &quot; she said . &quot; We have tended to separate the two. &quot; Her intention is to use what she learned to help people &quot; better understand where we are in the planet. &quot; And by so doing , Sola said , she intends to help preserve it .</TEXT>
