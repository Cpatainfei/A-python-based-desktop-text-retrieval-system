   <HEADLINE> KEVORKIAN CLOSER TO LOSING STATE LICENSE ; COURT : HE FAILED TO APPEAR BEFORE JUDGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSISTED SUICIDES OF A COSTA MESA MAN AND SAN DIEGO WOMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dr. Jack Kevorkian moved closer Tuesday to having his California medical license revoked when he failed to appear at a hearing before an administrative_law judge here in connection with the assisted suicides of a Costa Mesa man and a woman from San Diego . By not attending or sending a lawyer to represent him , Kevorkian defaulted_on keeping his license , which state officials suspended in April , 1993 . Judge Joyce Wharton forwarded the_matter to the Medical Board of California , which is expected to revoke the license . &quot; The effect of this litigation is to reduce Jack Kevorkian to Mr. Kevorkian , &quot; said Deputy Atty . Gen . Thomas Lazar , who represented the state at Tuesday ' s hearing . &quot; He ' s essentially been kicked_out of the world of medicine . In any future litigation , he won ' t be able to say , ' This was my patient. ' He ' s not licensed to practice medicine anywhere in the world. &quot; Early last year , Dixon Arnett , executive_director of the medical board , announced his intention to have the license revoked , expressing concern that Kevorkian had begun to &quot; recruit &quot; Californians who might desire his help in committing suicide . Arnett asked the judge to begin the proceedings after Kevorkian helped the two Southern Californians die . Kevorkian , 65 , dubbed &quot; Dr. Death &quot; for having assisted in 20 suicides , obtained a California medical license in 1957 and worked from 1979 to 1982 at two hospitals in Long_Beach . He lives_in Troy , Mich. , near where each of the suicides has taken_place . Kevorkian could not be reached for comment Tuesday , and his Michigan-based attorney , Geoffrey Fieger , declined to comment . But last year , when California suspended Kevorkian ' s license , Fieger said the retired pathologist had no intention of appealing . State officials presented evidence Tuesday showing that Kevorkian had assisted in the suicides of a Costa Mesa man -- whose best_friend argued that he was merely depressed over the death of his mother and not seriously ill -- and a San Diego woman suffering from terminal cancer . Jonathon Grenz got cancer in 1992 , causing doctors to remove his voice_box and tongue . But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian ' s help , he had recovered from the cancer and was grieving over the loss of his mother , according to the court testimony of Newport Beach real_estate_agent Linda Healy . At the time of his death early last year at age 44 , Grenz was &quot; depressed from his surgery , overwhelmed with grief over the loss of his mother and was never given the opportunity to grieve over his losses , &quot; testified Healy , who had worked with Grenz at an Orange County real_estate firm . Martha Ruwart , 40 , of San Diego , whose duodenal cancer had invaded her small_intestine and ovaries with numerous tumors , died in a Waterford , Mich. , home_in 1993 with Kevorkian by her side . It was Ruwart ' s death that prompted the Michigan legislature to pass a law banning assisted suicide . Kevorkian , who assisted in five suicides after Ruwart ' s , was recently acquitted of having violated Michigan ' s law . However , the Michigan Court of Appeals on Tuesday ordered murder_charges reinstated against Kevorkian in connection with his role the 1991 deaths of two women and also overturned the state law designed to stop Kevorkian ' s practice of assisted suicide . Michigan , the only other state in which Kevorkian has ever practiced medicine , suspended his license in 1991 . But the license has yet to be revoked in Michigan , where Kevorkian ' s attorneys continue to argue that being prevented from assisting in suicides would violate his constitutional liberties .</TEXT>
