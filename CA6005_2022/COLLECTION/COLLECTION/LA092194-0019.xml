   <HEADLINE> PROSTATE CANCER NEEDS EARLY DETECTION ; MEDICINE : PRECIOUS TIME IS BEING WASTED ON THE DEBATE ON THE MERITS OF BROAD SCREENING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hospitals and clinics across the country are offering prostate-cancer screening this month for free or substantially reduced cost . At a time when health-care issues are uppermost in our national consciousness , this important service deserves special attention . The irony is that as more Americans become aware of the benefits of early detection , widespread screening for breast and prostate cancer is controversial . At a time when it remains difficult to win appropriate funding for research into the cause and cure for these diseases , there are those who cling_to another approach -- let ' s pretend we ' re doing enough . Reducing the scope of screening will not reduce the incidence of any cancer . The object of screening is to identify cases that can benefit from early diagnosis . In 1993 , breast_cancer killed about 42 # 000 women , while prostate cancer killed about 36 # 000 men in this country . Many of them might have survived had their cancers been discovered in the earliest stages . On the issue of breast-cancer screening , informed women are speaking out energetically . Ever since Betty Ford first spoke frankly about her disease , women have understood that open communication is a key element of treatment , that they play a vital role in their own healthy futures and that nothing can be taken_for granted . For men , unfortunately , there is little parallel experience . Some prominent Americans have been lost to prostate cancer lately , among them musician Frank Zappa and actors Bill Bixby and Don Ameche . Bixby and Zappa , both only in their 50s when they died , were considerably younger than the &quot; typical &quot; prostate-cancer patient . Each acknowledged the nature of his illness -- not always the case with prostate cancer -- and each apparently was aware that earlier detection might have increased his longevity . The arguments against broad screening focus_on the assertion that it is difficult to demonstrate a relationship between early detection and increased longevity . In the past , studies have not documented such a correlation . But a more recent analysis shows a 3 1 / 2-year difference , according to Dr. Peter Scardino , chairman of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . Two other areas also are the focus of much discussion : the economics of screening and the impacts of treatment . On the economic front , there is concern that large-scale screening is a &quot; cash_cow &quot; for some interests . One view is that as health-care structure is reshaped , reducing the scope of screening will be an important mechanism for reducing costs . The flip side of that economic argument is the tremendous cost of waiting to treat this disease until it has reached advanced stages . Each year , the federal_government spends almost $ 5 billion in prostate-cancer treatment . The cost of screening is , in fact , an important investment . But a more sensitive issue is the most intimate one . Some treatment for prostate cancer may cause undesirable side_effects , including incontinence and impotence . And in many cases , it ' s not at all_clear when such treatments are necessary . Prostate cancer is a mysterious disease . It is present in most men over 60 , to at least a minimal degree . In many cases , it grows very slowly over the years and causes no particular symptoms or ill effects . When the disease occurs in younger_men -- and 25 % of all cases occur in men under the age of 60 -- it is often more virulent . It metastasizes quickly , leading inevitably to a difficult death . Not all cases follow these patterns . Unfortunately , no one can predict which cancers will grow and spread and which may languish for years . This poses a dilemma for both doctors and patients : Is it better to suggest a treatment that may affect the most intimate aspects of a man ' s life , or to monitor the progress of the disease closely , taking action only if it becomes clearly necessary ? Or is it easier to limit screening and reduce the number of times the difficult question arises ? Clearly , the third answer is no answer at all . The real answer to prostate cancer , as with so many other diseases , is the assurance of an appropriate level of research funding . Only when the cause of this terrible disease is understood will the best possible answer be found . In the shorter term , the arguments against screening are plainly without merit . It is true that , upon learning they have prostate cancer , some men will face difficult choices . But unless they know and understand their circumstances fully , they will have no choice whatsoever . I can think_of nothing less fair , or right , than that .</TEXT>
