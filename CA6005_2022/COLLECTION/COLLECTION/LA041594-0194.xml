   <HEADLINE> ELABORATE SAFETY MEASURES FAILED TO AVERT DISASTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The downing of two U.S. helicopters by a pair of American warplanes over Iraq occurred despite a host of systems designed precisely to avert that kind of mistake , Pentagon officials said Thursday . The systems , which have evolved with the march of technology since World_War_II , range from the simple to the highly sophisticated , and should have begun with a meeting on Wednesday . Under military procedures , the pilots of friendly aircraft flying within the same hostile zones are to meet the day before to discuss their missions . Once airborne , the pilots could also rely_on four different means of radio communication . And finally , the jet pilots could have depended_upon visual identification . As the United States set_about the grim task of notifying the families of those killed in the latest incident of &quot; friendly fire , &quot; U.S. military investigators began poring over hours of recorded information from the cockpits of the two F-15C jets and from the nerve_center of an airborne command_post to determine what went_wrong . It is , for the moment , a mystery . The circumstances of the downing do little to explain the breakdown . The F-15Cs ' missile attack took_place in clear daylight , with an AWACS plane -- a sophisticated aerial command_post -- in control of operations . It occurred in an area that had seen little Iraqi military activity . As a result , the air crews involved are unlikely to have been in a high state of alert or distracted by enemy forces , as a Navy crew argued had occurred in a previous tragic case of mistaken identity -- the downing of an Iranian airliner in 1988 by a missile fired from the U.S. guided-missile cruiser Vincennes . Moreover , the American commander of the U.N. operation , Air_Force Brig . Gen . Scott Pilkington , had checked the safety procedures himself the day before Thursday ' s tragic accident -- and apparently found all was in_order . &quot; Strange things happen , &quot; said retired Adm . James Winnefeld of the RAND Corp. , an expert in the command and control of combat forces , upon learning of the accident from a reporter . &quot; Something like this is the result of a breakdown somewhere in the system . It ' s really disappointing because we managed to do Operation_Desert_Storm so well with many , many_more opportunities to blow it . For something like this to happen under these circumstances is a real tragedy. &quot; Indeed , it appears that several systems set_in place to avoid such &quot; friendly fire &quot; failed . First , Lt . Gen . Richard F . Keller , chief_of_staff of the U.S. European Command , said the pilots of the AWACS plane , the F-15Cs and the Blackhawk helicopters should have been &quot; tied_in tightly &quot; as a result of a meeting that was scheduled to have been held Wednesday . In that forum , the details of each aircraft ' s flight plans -- altitudes and times and the radio frequencies they would monitor during flight -- should have been coordinated and discussed by air crews that would be in command of planes aloft at_the_same_time . Keller said that &quot; as a matter of routine , &quot; it is safe to assume the meeting was held . The Blackhawk choppers were hopscotching from town to town in northern Iraq , carrying senior American , French , British and Turkish military officials and several Kurdish leaders , according to Keller . Some Pentagon officials suggested the choppers may have deviated from their announced flight plan , or that the AWACS plane and the F-15Cs may have lost track of the helicopters as they made their numerous stops . Under such a circumstance , the F-15Cs and AWACS plane could have failed to recognize the choppers when they reappeared on their radar . But had that happened , the pilots of the F-15Cs , as well as their controllers aboard the AWACS plane , should have had other means of determining identity . First , the Blackhawks , like all aircraft not directly engaged in combat operations , should have been broadcasting a continuous signal of identification over an international civil navigation frequency . This &quot; squawking &quot; signal alone could have tipped_off the combat aircraft to the choppers ' identities . Beyond that broadcast , the F-15Cs or the AWACS plane had three other electronic_signals that they could have used to confirm the choppers were friendly . The Air_Force planes should have been able to use a sophisticated &quot; identification friend or foe &quot; system that sends_out an electronic &quot; Who goes there ? &quot; query . The Army helicopters are equipped with corresponding systems designed to respond automatically with a friendly identification message . But the systems must be turned_on , operating correctly and accurately programmed . Under conditions of military tension , including those that may have existed above Iraq on Thursday , an aircraft may be presumed hostile if it fails to respond affirmatively to such a challenge of a fellow aircraft . The &quot; identification friend or foe &quot; system now in_use aboard U.S. warplanes can operate in any one of three electronic modes , all_of which should have been available to all_the aircraft involved in Thursday ' s incident . Military experts , including an experienced F-15C pilot , on Thursday said they were mystified that none of the four electronic procedures designed to elicit the choppers ' identity as &quot; friendly &quot; revealed that vital information . Finally , there is the most low-tech means of identification : the eyes of the two F-15C pilots , who are trained to recognize most enemy aircraft . Keller pointed to one feature that may have helped deceive the pilots -- the Blackhawk helicopters were carrying external fuel tanks to extend their range ; those pods appear to heighten similarities between the Blackhawk and Soviet-made Hind helicopters flown_by the Iraqi air_force . Procedures such_as the electronic_signaling that should have taken_place Thursday helped U.S. military and allied aircraft in the Persian_Gulf_War operate without a single &quot; blue-on-blue , &quot; or &quot; friendly fire , &quot; casualty . That was the case even though hundreds of dissimilar aircraft from several countries and many different services operated in close proximity to one another . By contrast , &quot; friendly fire &quot; claimed dozens of casualties among ground units in the Persian_Gulf ; those units operated in the confusion of fast-moving tank battles without benefit of identification systems as sophisticated as those used by allied warplanes . In the wake of the Gulf War , an Army-led working_group has sought to improve the procedures and the technologies used to distinguish friend from foe . Safety Beacons in the Sky U.S. aircraft in the region are equipped with &quot; identification &quot; friend or foe systems &quot; that are supposed to alert pilots that they are dealing with American aircraft . Beacons at_Work 1 . The devices receive and transmit constant electronic pulses . 2 . If a U.S. aircraft wanted to double-check an aircraft ' s identity , it could send a pulse that would query the aircraft . 3 . A device would then provide a visual indication that they were being &quot; queried , &quot; and would automatically send_back a signal indicating they were friendly . What Went Wrong ? It is possible that one or all_of the systems were not working right , or they may simply not have been turned_on . Source : Times Washington Bureau , wire reports</TEXT>
