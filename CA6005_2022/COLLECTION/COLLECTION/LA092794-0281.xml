   <HEADLINE> THE MELDING AMERICAS ; CULTURE ; AMERICAS PROVE THEY ' RE NOT ALWAYS POLES APART ; RODEOS ROPE BRAZILIAN HEARTS WHILE AMERICANS SWING TO LATIN BEATS . BUT THE EXCHANGE IS FAR FROM EVEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The only thing missing was a Texas drawl or an Oklahoma Yee haw ! because as far as American rodeos go , the thousands of Brazilians who had gathered at the exposition center here on a crisp Saturday night had almost everything else covered . To the strains of Ricky Skaggs singing &quot; Crying My Heart Out Over You , &quot; local riders bolted_out of the chutes atop bucking broncos and twisting , snorting bulls with names like No Future . Other cowboys , their leather chaps flapping , roped and wrestled steers to the ground , while cowgirls ran their mounts through the barrel races . In the crowd , cowpoke wanna-bes were decked_out in proper Western wear -- broad-brimmed hats , silver-buckled embroidered belts and Wrangler jeans ( the special &quot; Rodeo Endorsed &quot; edition ) that hung just so atop the Tony Lama boots . Those who arrived without the proper accouterments needed only to mosey over to the Simpson Bros . Western Wear trailer . There , salesman Celso Marcello was happy to show them a pair of Justin boots , lead them through a variety of spurs , lariats and other Western paraphernalia -- &quot; straight from Texas , &quot; he boasted in Portuguese -- or fit them into jeans that advertised , in English , the much-sought-after &quot; cowboy cut. &quot; And what cowboy would be complete without his chewing tobacco . Marcello offered both Beech-Nut and Skoal . The Wild_West , or at least the 20th-Century version of the uniquely North_American phenomenon , had come_to this mid-sized town tucked about 300 miles southwest of Sao Paulo . It was just one example of entwined cultures of the Americas . From basketballs to soccer_balls , Snoop Doggy Dogg to Julio Iglesias , McDonald ' s to Taco Bell , &quot; True Lies &quot; to &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; the popular cultures of the two halves of the hemisphere have washed against each other , leaving their marks in obvious and not so obvious ways . &quot; You see it everywhere , &quot; said Carlao Andrade , owner of a Rio de Janeiro record company and recording_studio that handles mainly American clients . &quot; I go_to the States , and I see things that are Brazilian or at least from Latin_American countries . And here , you see the ( U.S. ) influence in almost everything. &quot; Kindergartners at the Sierra_Nevada school in Mexico_City decorate their classrooms for Thanksgiving , while elementary students in New Orleans celebrate Mexican Independence_Day . American authors such_as Stephen King and Sidney Sheldon are perennial best_sellers in Latin_American countries , while Brazilian Jorge Amado , Colombian Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mexican Carlos Fuentes are renowned in U.S. literary circles . In Latin_America ' s two most populous nations -- Mexico and Brazil -- delivery_boys hustle up and down city streets with red , white and blue Domino ' s Pizza boxes , just as they do_in hundreds of U.S. cities . Meanwhile , Chilean families settle_down to meals of empanadas , as do diners at the Las Pampas restaurant in Washington , D.C. The regions have even swapped slang . Hipsters in U.S. urban_centers have long greeted each other casually with the phrase que pasa , while surfers in Portuguese-speaking Rio de Janeiro refer to each other as Bro . Hasta la vista , thanks in large part to Arnold Schwarzenegger , has become a household phrase in remote American towns such_as Sylacauga , Ala. , while throughout Latin_America OK is a universal term of approval . Each hemispherical pole influences the other , but the exchange is far from even . Despite a long history of Latin influence in the United States that includes Afro-Cuban music in the 1930s , Mexican mural painting in the 1940s , Brazilian bossa nova in the 1950s and South and Central_American architectural_styles throughout the century , Latin culture in America is still for the most part segregated in the communities of Spanish-speaking immigrants or naturalized Latino citizens . For example , while music by American pop stars is routinely mixed into the radio formats of salsa and samba in South and Central_America , Latin-influenced music in the United States is primarily limited to Spanish-language radio_stations . American television_programs , dubbed in Spanish or Portuguese , are routinely broadcast on Latin stations , but Latin-originated programming is almost never seen on English-language channels in the United States . &quot; that ' s true , &quot; said Broderic Camp , professor of Latin_American studies and head of the political_science department at Tulane University in New Orleans . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s really directed at Latin_American culture . It ' s just that in America we ' ve always been more focused on ourselves than other cultures. &quot; Still , the cultural fertilization is far from being a one-way_street , Camp said . &quot; The fact is that Latin_America has really replaced France as the most significant external cultural influence in the United States , &quot; he said . The most obvious areas are art , food and music . &quot; The ( Latin ) music is now so entwined with most popular_music that you can ' t be a real musician today without understanding Latin rhythms , &quot; said drummer Ndugu Chancler , who has played with artists from Miles Davis to Carlos Santana . &quot; And not only that , you have to be able to differentiate between Afro-Cuban and Brazilian rhythms. &quot; Nevertheless , U.S. culture has made a far greater impact in the hemisphere , as evidenced by the rodeo trappings in the Brazilian interior . There , pickup_trucks are the rage . Local discos play country_music , both American and an American-influenced Brazilian brand called caipiria . The onslaught of things North_American has been fueled by the pervasive presence of U.S. television_programs , movies and a rapidly growing fast-food franchise industry that fosters the American way_of_life . Throughout Latin_America , which has minuscule film_industries , American movies are the staple , representing at least 80 % of the market . Of the top 50 video rentals in Brazil last year , for example , only one was not a U.S.-made film . &quot; Our movies do sell America and an American way_of_life , both the good and the bad &quot; said Harry Stone , senior_vice_president for the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , with offices in Rio de Janeiro . And South_Americans are regular TV watchers of &quot; Cheers , &quot; &quot; Golden Girls , &quot; &quot; L.A. Law , &quot; &quot; Star Trek : Deep_Space Nine , &quot; &quot; Baywatch &quot; and American sports . American music has flooded into Latin_America via radio and MTV . Aerosmith is ranked in the Top 10 in Peru and Argentina ; Toni Braxton holds a Top 10 spot in Chile . &quot; The music changed the way people wanted to dress , the way they walk , the way they talk , &quot; said Johnny Pereira , who programs American music for a dozen Brazilian radio_stations . &quot; You ' ve got Brazilian rappers , just everything. &quot; The influx has been met with mixed feelings . &quot; There ' s good and bad , &quot; said Laura Cerrato , a professor of literature at the University of Buenos Aires . &quot; What we get is the most mediocre of American literature , Stephen King and Sidney Sheldon . We get Michael Jackson and Madonna , but we don ' t get some of the better music or better literature . At least in America the buyer gets a chance to choose. &quot; &quot; The good , &quot; Mexican author Homero Aridjis said , &quot; is that the American political culture , with its democracy and division of powers , is an impressive model for freedom. &quot; But like many , Aridjis worries that Latin_America will be drowned by the American cultural wave : &quot; The Mexican culture is losing its own identity and imitating American standards_of_life and culture due_to the invasion of American TV and films . America exports its violence and consumerism . . . . Mexican youth watch these shows and want to go_out and imitate what they see . . . . It ' s a tough issue . The question is whether we can prevent American culture from killing_off our own. &quot; Times staff writer Jube Shiver in Washington and researcher Susan Drummet in Mexico_City contributed to this story .</TEXT>
