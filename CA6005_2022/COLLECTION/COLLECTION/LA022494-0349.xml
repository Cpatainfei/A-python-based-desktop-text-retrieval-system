   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA CROATS REJECT PLAN TO LINK UP WITH MUSLIMS ; BALKANS : THE ABRUPT TURNABOUT IS A SETBACK FOR U.S. PLANS FOR A NEGOTIATED PEACE . THE TWO SIDES DO AGREE TO HALT FIGHTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s Croatian minority have abruptly rejected a U.S.-brokered proposal for political union with Bosnia ' s Muslims , dealing a setback to the Clinton_Administration ' s plans for a negotiated peace in the divided republic , officials said Wednesday . However , Croatian and Muslim military_leaders agreed to halt the fighting between their forces in Mostar and other central Bosnian towns , giving U.S. diplomats hope that political talks can get_back on track . The idea of a new republic that would join Bosnia ' s Muslims and its Roman_Catholic Croats has become the center of U.S. negotiating efforts in the former Yugoslav republic , and the Croats ' rejection of the idea left U.S. diplomats scrambling . The diplomatic flurry reflected a new reality in the Bosnian imbroglio : After months of standing on the sidelines , the United States has suddenly replaced Europe as the main broker for any peace deal . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher strongly endorsed the proposed Muslim-Croatian combination , telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the idea has &quot; many , many advantages. &quot; &quot; If they could get_together , it would make_for a more viable state , &quot; Christopher said , adding that it would also make the job of international peacekeepers -- including U.S. troops , if and when they are deployed to enforce a peace accord -- much easier . &quot; I don ' t know whether that will happen , but it is certainly part of the peace initiative that we want to promote with as much encouragement as we can , &quot; he said . An earlier , European-designed peace plan would have divided Bosnia into three provinces -- one for each of the country ' s main ethnic-religious groups -- the Muslims , the Croats and the Eastern Orthodox Serbs . The prime_minister of the Muslim-led Bosnian government , Haris Silajdzic , said that he is bitter about the Bosnian Croats ' sudden turnabout and charged that they are being manipulated by both neighboring Croatia and Serbia . &quot; They agreed and they backed_away , probably because there was a consultation ( by Croatia ) with Belgrade , &quot; the Serbian and Yugoslav capital , he said . &quot; We have been talking to them for months &quot; to prevent the division of Bosnia in three parts , &quot; but we are not_able to convince them , &quot; he said . &quot; Frankly , I do not know where we go from here. &quot; U.S. officials said Charles E . Redman , the State_Department ' s special negotiator for Bosnia , is trying to persuade the Croats to return to talks . One senior official , sending a pointed message to Croatia , said the United States could seek U.N. economic sanctions against Zagreb if it obstructs a solution in Bosnia . The U.N. Security_Council is already considering sanctions against Croatia because the republic has sent more_than 5 # 000 troops into Bosnia to reinforce Bosnian Croat forces there . The military truce was signed at the U.N. peacekeeping force base at Zagreb ' s airport by Rasim Delic , the Bosnian government ' s military commander , and Ante Roso , chief of the Bosnian Croat military_forces . In addition to the cease-fire , the two forces agreed to position U.N. peacekeepers in sensitive areas , withdraw artillery from front-line areas and establish a joint truce-monitoring commission . The Muslim-led Bosnian government and the Bosnian Croats fought as allies when Serbian-backed forces rebelled against the Sarajevo government in April , 1992 , but they later began fighting over land that their two communities shared . Christopher told the Senate committee that he still opposes the idea that this week ' s success in_forcing a withdrawal of artillery around Sarajevo should be followed by similar operations in other towns . &quot; I would emphasize that each of the safe areas in Bosnia is quite distinctive and quite different and you cannot put a template down on them and have one technique be useful in other areas , &quot; he said . However , he added that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization is moving ahead with plans to stop Serbian rebel shelling of the airport at Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia and to move new peacekeeping troops to the Serbian-besieged town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia . NATO agreed to undertake those missions at its meeting in Brussels last month .</TEXT>
