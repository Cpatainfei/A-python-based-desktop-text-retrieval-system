   <HEADLINE> U.S. SECRETLY PUSHES CHINA ON HUMAN_RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has launched a secret , intensive diplomatic campaign to get China to make more concessions on human_rights in the final weeks before the U.S. deadline for deciding whether Beijing ' s trade privileges in this country should be renewed , officials say . In effect , the Administration is now trying through secret negotiations to do what Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher was unable to do_in Beijing last March -- to make the Chinese regime take seriously President Clinton ' s oft-repeated threats to curb China ' s trade benefits if it fails to take concrete steps to ease its repressive policies . In recent days , Administration officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that the President has dispatched a secret emissary to Beijing for talks with the Chinese government . The Administration must decide by June 3 whether to renew China ' s &quot; most favored nation &quot; trade benefits , which permit Chinese goods to be exported to the United States with the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations . &quot; We ' re not going_to have any comment on any diplomacy that is going_on , &quot; White_House spokesman Tom Ross said Friday . Defending the secrecy , a senior Administration official said : &quot; We ' re in the delicate last stages of this thing , and there ' s a fierce desire not to say anything. &quot; Two senior officials from the Jimmy_Carter Administration , White_House National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michel Oksenberg , Brzezinski ' s China expert on the National Security_Council , are scheduled to land Monday in Beijing to take_part in what is officially described as a conference . Brzezinski and Oksenberg were in_charge of the 1978 negotiations leading_up to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing . In resorting_to secret diplomacy with Beijing , the Administration is following essentially the same path taken by former President George_Bush , whom Clinton criticized in the 1992 campaign for &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in China . In the six months after China ' s bloody 1989 crackdown , Bush twice dispatched Brent Scowcroft , his national security adviser , and Deputy Secretary_of_State Lawrence S . Eagleburger on secret missions to Beijing . Winston Lord , now Clinton ' s assistant secretary_of_state for East Asia and the Pacific , then denounced Bush for sending &quot; fawning emissaries &quot; to China . Under an executive order issued by Clinton a year ago , China was supposed to make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights by this June if it wanted to get its trade benefits renewed for another year . This spring , human_rights groups and several Administration officials have acknowledged that China has not yet made this progress . Over the last few months , the Beijing regime has appeared to take several steps backward by rearresting dissidents who had been freed , such_as leading democracy activist Wei Jingsheng . But early today , China ' s official New China News Service said that prominent pro-democracy activist Chen Ziming has been freed , the Reuters news_agency reported . U.S. business groups worry that without new concessions from Beijing on human_rights , the Administration will curb China ' s trade benefits , and Beijing will then retaliate against U.S. companies . The Administration ' s immediate goal is to see if it can win enough changes from Beijing to be able to claim that there has been &quot; significant progress. &quot; Among the possibilities would be a series of releases of prominent dissidents , a promise to end the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts or some new agreement on talks with the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan leader . National Security Adviser Anthony Lake referred briefly to the new negotiations in a television interview Thursday when he acknowledged that after the Christopher trip , the Administration had decided to switch to quiet diplomacy with China . &quot; The way to work this through was to drain the venom out of that rhetoric ( between China and the United States ) , which we have done over the last month or so , and to work it with them very hard and privately , &quot; Lake said . Lake met at the White_House Thursday with Wang Juntao , a pro-democracy activist just released from prison in China . In that session , Lake indicated that the Administration has obtained some new concessions from the Beijing government on human_rights . But he did not say exactly what China had promised or when it would be made public . Douglas Paal , who served as director of Asian affairs for Bush ' s National Security_Council , said he had urged the appointment of a secret emissary to China a month ago but that Administration officials then were not receptive . &quot; I was asked_for my ideas after the Christopher fiasco , &quot; Paal said . &quot; I suggested an emissary and I suggested some names , including Brzezinski and Oksenberg . I was told Clinton had ruled it out . But now they must be getting desperate. &quot; One congressional Democrat observed Friday that if the Administration has resorted_to special emissaries and secret negotiations with China , it would amount to &quot; a statement that the normal institutions of diplomacy aren ' t working. &quot; During Christopher ' s trip to Beijing last March , Chinese and U.S. officials called daily news_conferences at which they issued angry denunciations of one another . Chinese officials accused the American visitors of trying to interfere in China ' s domestic politics . At one point , Christopher told his Chinese host , Foreign Minister Qian Qichen , &quot; I wish the talks were as_good_as the lunch. &quot; State_Department officials contended this week that the secretary_of_state is still in_charge of Administration negotiations with China . &quot; We have had an intensive dialogue with China , following_up_on the presentation Secretary Christopher made in Beijing , &quot; one Administration official said Friday . In a carefully worded statement , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing told The Times on Friday that it had not been informed of any special emissaries sent to China by Clinton . Times staff writers Rone Tempest in Beijing and Doyle McManus in Geneva contributed to this report .</TEXT>
