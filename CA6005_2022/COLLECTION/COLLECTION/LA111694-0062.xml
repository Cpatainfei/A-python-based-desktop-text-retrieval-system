   <HEADLINE> PARTS OF PROP . 187 MAY BE BLOCKED 2 OR MORE YEARS ; LAW : ANALYSTS SAY SOME PORTIONS VULNERABLE . STATE WILL ASK FOR TIME TO DRAFT RULES TO AVOID CONSTITUTIONAL PITFALLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the court fight over Proposition 187 resumes today in Los Angeles , many constitutional analysts say the measure ' s legal flaws could block some provisions for two to three years until the U.S. Supreme Court or the state high_court makes a final ruling . &quot; I think at least a substantial part will be enjoined , and there is a good chance all will be enjoined , &quot; said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky . State Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren , a supporter of the initiative who will make a procedural move to keep the legal battle before elected state judges , conceded that parts of Proposition 187 are vulnerable to legal challenge . &quot; I ' ll just say this , &quot; Lungren said , &quot; I am glad there is a severability clause &quot; that lets the initiative remain law even if certain provisions are struck_down . At an afternoon hearing today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , the state will argue that judges should not block enforcement of Proposition 187 until regulations to implement the law are completed . The regulations , Lungren said , may avoid the constitutional pitfalls that a strict reading of the ballot measure could raise . Opponents of the sweeping measure vow to force the state to defend the initiative itself , not the regulations . They will seek a court_order today barring implementation of the law , citing cases of illegal immigrants who already have had problems getting public benefits since voters approved the proposition . &quot; They know they have serious constitutional problems , &quot; complained Mark Rosenbaum , an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who is attempting to invalidate the entire measure , &quot; and they are really trying to write a different statute. &quot; Lawyers and legal scholars are divided over the ultimate fate of Proposition 187 and which Supreme Court -- California ' s , which is dominated by conservatives appointed by Republican governors , or the nation ' s -- would be more likely to uphold more of the measure that seeks to deny most public_services to illegal immigrants . Legal analysts predicted the following twists in the court wrangle over the measure : * A provision preventing illegal immigrants from attending public_schools probably will be blocked by courts pending review by either the state or U.S. Supreme Court . A San Francisco Superior_Court judge already has issued a temporary order prohibiting the state from enforcing the provision , which wasn ' t due_to take_effect until Jan . 1 . * Arguments that the initiative usurps federal authority over immigration will prove to be a thornier legal question . Although the U.S. Supreme Court in the past has prevented states from passing certain laws aimed at illegal immigrants , the high_court could interpret federal law as a floor that states can build_upon as long as the final result mirrors national policies . * Some of the measure ' s provisions that require reporting of illegal immigrants probably will be struck_down , while others will withstand court scrutiny . Careful regulations , however , could save some of the reporting requirements by making them consistent with federal law . * The state , which is defending Proposition 187 , probably will attempt to consolidate the eight federal and state lawsuits against the measure and move the case out of Los Angeles . U.S. District Judge Mariana R . Pfaelzer , who has been selected to hear the four suits filed_in Los Angeles , is considered a smart , independent liberal who is more likely to rule_in favor of the opponents than the state . A Carter appointee , Pfaelzer is out of town , and U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. , considered a moderate liberal , will preside over today ' s hearing . Analysts said the provision banning illegal immigrants from attending public_schools is the most vulnerable , at least temporarily , because the U.S. Supreme Court struck_down a similar Texas law in a 1982 case called Plyler vs . Doe . &quot; It is about as sure a thing there ever is in a legal question , &quot; said Chemerinsky , who predicted that the provision will be blocked by trial and appellate_courts pending high_court review . Although the current U.S. Supreme Court probably would have decided Plyler differently , analysts said , the justices may be reluctant to overturn precedent . &quot; There is a decent chance &quot; the high_court will reverse the decision , said UC Berkeley constitutional law professor Jesse Choper , &quot; but any time you challenge a precedent you have an uphill battle . The people who sought to overturn Roe vs . Wade learned that. &quot; The initiative must comply with both the state and the U.S. constitutions . If the California Supreme Court struck_down the schools provision on state constitutional grounds , review by the U.S. Supreme Court would be unnecessary , Chemerinsky said . The California high_court has previously interpreted education as a fundamental interest under the state Constitution . This interpretation creates a special legal hurdle that must be crossed by anyone attempting to deny access to public_schools . Because there is no such hurdle under federal law , some believe the opponents of Proposition 187 would have a better chance before the state court . Most legal analysts , however , accurately predicted that Lungren would prefer to try the cases before elected state judges . Federal judges have lifetime tenure , so are shielded from political pressures , and Lungren also knows that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , the first stop for most appeals , includes many liberal judges . The California Supreme Court , which has only one Democrat , is reputed to bend over backward to uphold voter initiatives . The court could simply distinguish the initiative from previous education cases and uphold the schooling provisions , said Chemerinsky . The ACLU lawsuit , one of the four filed_in Los Angeles federal_court , is the broadest in scope because it tries to overturn the entire initiative on a variety of legal grounds , including the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution . States are prohibited under this clause from engaging in foreign relations , according to Loyola constitutional law professor Karl Manheim , who is working with the ACLU and who said immigration is an &quot; outgrowth &quot; of foreign_policy . He contended that Proposition 187 already has sparked anger within the government of Mexico . Top Mexican officials sent a diplomatic note to the U.S._government protesting the initiative before the election . Some legal analysts described the ACLU arguments as strong but less certain to prevail in court than the cases filed against the school provisions . Chemerinsky said the U.S. Supreme Court has twice stopped states from enacting immigration regulations based on the argument that states cannot step into issues over which the federal_government already has jurisdiction . The court ruled about 50 years ago that Pennsylvania was illegally preempting federal law by requiring illegal immigrants to register in the state , the USC law professor said . In 1982 the high_court also declared unconstitutional an attempt by Maryland to deny resident illegal immigrants in-state college tuition , he added . &quot; I think there are arguments to be made on both sides , &quot; Whittier Law_School professor Mary Ellen Gale said . &quot; The U.S. Supreme Court has taken a fairly strong view ( in favor ) of state rights. &quot; She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of California in 1983 to pass a law prohibiting new nuclear_power plants unless the electric_company building them could show it had a safe means of disposal for nuclear waste . The federal_government argued unsuccessfully that the state law was illegal because nuclear safety is the responsibility of the federal_government . But the high_court , Gale said , decided the state had not preempted the federal role because the law was aimed at economic concerns , not safety . She also said the requirement of Proposition 187 that police investigate the immigration status of arrested suspects &quot; probably would not be unconstitutional. &quot; Other analysts said requirements that social_workers report illegal immigrants to immigration authorities conflict with federal regulations aimed at protecting patient confidentiality in Medi-Cal programs and probably would be thrown_out by the lower courts . Most illegal immigrants are not covered by Medi-Cal in non-emergency situations anyway , say officials . Lawyers fighting to derail the initiative contend that some immigrants without green_cards are entitled to public-assisted health_care under federal law but would not be under Proposition 187 -- grounds for striking down the health_care provisions in the measure . But Lungren said : &quot; People have to look_at what our regulations are going_to say . . . . There will be a serious attempt to have them drawn_in a way that makes them consistent with the Constitution and current federal law. &quot; Lungren refused to say whether he thought the courts would uphold a section of Proposition 187 that opponents find the most troubling . It requires school districts to check the immigration status of students ' parents and to report those without legal_documents to authorities . That provision would take_effect in 1996 . &quot; From a public policy standpoint , &quot; said Lungren , who endorsed Proposition 187 on the eve of the election , &quot; that is the issue that gave me the most trouble in deciding whether to support it. &quot; Chemerinsky said , however , that he doubted any regulation preventing illegal immigrants from attending public_schools would be upheld by the courts . &quot; Maybe the regulations can save some of the reporting provisions , &quot; he said . &quot; Courts are often willing to allow laws to be narrowed if there is a way to save them . But it really has to be a situation . . . where the law is not so fatally flawed that it is clearly unconstitutional. &quot; Times staff writers Paul Feldman and Stanley Meisler contributed to this report .
