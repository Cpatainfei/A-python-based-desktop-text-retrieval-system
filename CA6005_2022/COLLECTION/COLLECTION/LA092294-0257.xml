   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; IN POLICY_CHANGE , U.S. TROOPS IN EFFECT TO SUPERVISE HAITIAN POLICE ; MILITARY : REVERSAL FOLLOWS TV FOOTAGE OF AMERICAN FORCES WATCHING AS MAN IS BEATEN TO DEATH IN ISLAND NATION ' S CAPITAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , scrambling to avoid further embarrassing incidents of violence in Haiti , announced Wednesday that U.S. military_police in_effect will supervise Haitian police and intervene if necessary to stop abuses . In an abrupt turnabout , the Pentagon said that more_than 1 # 000 American MPs newly landed on the island will be deployed to accompany Haitian police at &quot; every level &quot; of operations , with the power to call_in U.S. forces , if needed , to prevent excessive use of force . Pentagon officials said Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , also had assured Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that American forces ultimately will ensure that Haiti ' s civilian militia is fully disarmed and disbanded . The policy_change came_after the Administration was sharply criticized for incidents Tuesday in which American combat troops were forced to stand_by while club-wielding Haitian police waded into throngs of people , beating at least one man to death . Military officials insisted then that , under the agreement worked_out by a delegation led by former President Jimmy_Carter , American forces would be required to leave day-to-day police functions in the hands of the Haitian military and could not intervene to stop such excesses . But Wednesday , after footage of the beatings by the Haitian police was broadcast by U.S. television networks , the Administration announced that it would begin cracking_down on the situation , despite what officials had said the previous day . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said U.S. military_police &quot; will have the specific function of overseeing and monitoring the functioning of the Haiti police_force to ensure that they do not use unreasonable restraint in trying to deal with crowd_control problems. &quot; He also noted pointedly that the MPs will be able to call_in a new rapid-deployment force , equipped with Bradley fighting vehicles , if any situation gets_out of hand . &quot; We deplore the abhorrent acts of violence that took_place yesterday , &quot; Perry told Aristide . U.S. officials said there were no deaths or injuries from beatings in Haiti on Wednesday . The United States also told Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the Haitian strongman , that excessive violence by Haitian police would be unacceptable to the Administration and that police must stop beating and shooting ordinary citizens . Officials said U.S. Army Lt . Gen . Hugh Shelton , the American commander in Haiti , personally warned Cedras on the issue in a special meeting in Port-au-Prince on Wednesday . They said Cedras agreed to order the Haitian police to alter their tactics . Administration spokesmen insisted the new measures did not signal any change in rules of engagement for U.S. forces but merely &quot; accelerated &quot; by a_few days previous plans to deploy American MPs on the island . They also portrayed this use of American MPs as a temporary move , designed to keep Haitian police in check until peacekeeping duties are handed_over to a multinational U.N. force -- probably as early as next week , according to some officials . But U.S. Army Maj . Gen . Jared Bates , deputy operations director of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , conceded that , under the new policy , U.S. soldiers who witnessed a severe beating of a Haitian civilian &quot; would intervene. &quot; Senior Pentagon officials conceded that the situation remains fraught with risk , particularly if U.S. MPs end_up clashing with Haitian police , embroiling American forces in the civil strife that has existed since Aristide was forced_out . Military planners have said repeatedly that they want to avoid the &quot; mission creep &quot; that overtook American forces in Somalia , when orders that U.S. forces hunt_down Somali clan leader Mohammed Farah Aidid ended in a disastrous firefight that killed 18 U.S. Rangers . A senior military_officer who briefed reporters Wednesday skirted a question about whether the new use of U.S. MPs amounts to &quot; mission creep , &quot; while other officials expressed concern that the move might bring new risks . U.S. officials declined to elaborate on Shalikashvili ' s assurances to Aristide that American forces will ensure that Haiti ' s civilian militia ultimately is disarmed and disbanded , but that too amounted to a change from earlier policy . Officials had indicated that Washington would try to persuade the Haitian military to do the job , rather than having U.S. forces carry_out the disarming of the civilian militia . Also undecided was how far U.S. commanders might go_in prohibiting public demonstrations in Haiti -- another move being considered to help reduce violence by minimizing the chance for confrontations between Aristide supporters and Haitian police . Officials said that , in his meeting with Perry and Shalikashvili , Aristide argued that his supporters ought to be permitted to hold political demonstrations . They said Shalikashvili agreed to consider the request but made no definite commitment . Military officials insisted Wednesday that using MPs to supervise Haitian troops will not flout the Pentagon ' s previous rule against involving American soldiers in police work because MPs are trained in police techniques while regular combat troops are not .</TEXT>
