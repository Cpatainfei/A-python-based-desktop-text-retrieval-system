   <HEADLINE> FAA PROMISES FASTER ACTION ON SAFETY ISSUES ; AIRLINES : CHIEF VOWS CHANGES AFTER DISCLOSURES ABOUT AGENCY BEING WARNED ABOUT POTENTIALLY FATAL WAKE TURBULENCE CREATED BY 757S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing criticism for their handling of the Boeing 757 wake turbulence problem , federal aviation officials Thursday vowed to move more swiftly to alert those in the airline industry to potential safety hazards and announced new measures intended to prevent accidents . The announcement marked the second time the Federal Aviation Administration has taken safety-related steps since it was disclosed that agency officials had been warned about the potential danger of wake turbulence created by 757s years before two fatal_accidents claimed 13 lives . Testifying before the House subcommittee on technology , environment and aviation , FAA Administrator David R . Hinson pledged that within 60 days his agency would review the role of its Office of Aviation Safety and create an efficient method to identify and act_upon safety issues . &quot; I have asked specifically that they define management responsibility and accountability more clearly , so that we may be confident that safety issues are raised and receive appropriate priorities , &quot; Hinson said . Hinson said the agency has hired an official from RAND , a well-known think_tank , whose top priorities will include ensuring that safety concerns raised by scientists and researchers within the FAA get a proper hearing inside and outside the agency . And starting this weekend -- at a convention of general aviation pilots in Oshkosh , Wis . -- the FAA ' s Flight Standards and Aviation Safety office will disseminate information to pilots on the wake turbulence issue , Hinson said . He said the agency also will quickly establish a process that makes certain that &quot; emerging safety issues are addressed promptly and effectively. &quot; Hinson ' s announcements came two days after an internal report concluded that the FAA may have mishandled the 757 wake turbulence issue because bureaucracy and poor communication sometimes compromised the agency ' s ability to pinpoint and respond to potential safety problems in a timely fashion . The internal report and Thursday ' s hearing were prompted by a June 5 story in The Times , revealing that internal documents showed that the FAA had been warned about the 757 wake turbulence hazard by its chief scientist , Robert E . Machol , starting in 1989 . Eleven days before the first of two 757 turbulence-related fatal_accidents , Machol had predicted to FAA managers that a &quot; major crash &quot; would occur if the agency failed to take actions to protect planes , especially smaller ones , landing behind 757s . Subcommittee members Thursday repeatedly expressed concerns that the FAA could -- and should -- have acted sooner on the 757 turbulence issue . At a minimum , most appeared to believe that the agency should have publicly drawn attention to the problem sometime between the first fatal_accident in Billings , Mont. , in December , 1992 , and the second , in Santa Ana , in December , 1993 . The Billings crash took eight lives ; the Santa Ana crash killed five people , including the top two officials of the In-and-Out Burger chain . Both accidents happened after private aircraft encountered wake turbulence from 757s landing in front of them -- the very scenario Machol had laid_out beforehand . In his testimony at Thursday ' s hearing , Machol , who retired from the FAA on April 30 , said there was &quot; nothing brilliant about any of these predictions . There ( were ) very good , solid reasons &quot; for them , he said . But the blunt-spoken , former college professor portrayed the FAA as being the victim of a &quot; bureaucratic stasis that sometimes gets_in the way of anything useful &quot; being achieved . &quot; We have a situation where someone who seems to know what he ' s talking_about made a prediction that a cataclysmic accident could happen , &quot; said subcommittee member Rep . Dana Rohrabacher , ( R-Huntington Beach ) . Although the FAA often does its job well , Rohrabacher said , &quot; the way they did_it in this particular case . . . perhaps cost the lives of some innocent people. &quot; Asked at one point by Rohrabacher if some of the recently instituted operational procedures regarding 757s may have &quot; averted these two tragedies , &quot; Hinson paused and said , &quot; Yes , perhaps. &quot; During the five-hour hearing , subcommittee members also expressed concerns about why aviation officials in Canada and the United Kingdom took action on the 757 turbulence issue before the FAA did ; whether the FAA can balance its two missions of ensuring safety and promoting the airline industry , and when the agency will hire a new chief scientist to replace Machol . Thursday ' s actions by the FAA come two months after the agency in May adopted a policy requiring smaller planes in most instances to stay four miles behind 757s during landings to avoid their potentially deadly wake turbulence . Although there is not a consensus on the level of danger , the 757 ' s &quot; clean &quot; wing and body design appear to make_it capable of producing higher-intensity levels of wake turbulence , funnels of air emanating from each wingtip containing hurricane-force winds . For years , the FAA has resisted increasing the separation distance for planes landing behind 757s because it could cut the number of flights at the nation ' s busiest airports . That could result in delays and revenue losses for the aviation industry .</TEXT>
