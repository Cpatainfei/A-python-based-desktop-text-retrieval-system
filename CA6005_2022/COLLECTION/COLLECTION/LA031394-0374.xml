   <HEADLINE> PILOTS OF SHUTTLE ' LAND ' WITH LAPTOP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The shuttle Columbia ' s pilots practiced landings Saturday , using a laptop_computer that displayed the approach to the space center runway . Commander John Casper and pilot Andrew Allen took turns maneuvering a hand controller similar to the shuttle ' s real one , even though it will be nearly another week before they bring the shuttle down . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration wants to see if the landing simulator helps pilots maintain their flying skills in orbit . It was introduced in October . &quot; It ' s a good procedural review , &quot; Casper said . Casper and Allen plan to practice more landings before attempting the real_thing Friday . A study of spacecraft glow -- one of Columbia ' s primary ground-controlled experiments -- encountered more trouble Saturday . An ultraviolet-light detector malfunctioned and Mission Control had the crew zoom_in on the instrument with a camera on the end of Columbia ' s robot arm . Researchers at NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , suspect something might be partially blocking the light path . On Friday , the same researchers commanded a container on the shuttle to open and release nitrogen gas , but nothing emerged . The problem was traced to a ground computer and corrected . Scientists want to better understand the orange glow that surrounds spacecraft zooming through gas molecules . The glow can obscure telescope observations .</TEXT>
