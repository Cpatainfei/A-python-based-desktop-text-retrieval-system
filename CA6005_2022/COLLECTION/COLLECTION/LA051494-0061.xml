   <HEADLINE> FROM SAVING SOULS TO SOCIAL ACTIVISM ; COMMUNITIES : ONCE-INSULAR EVANGELICAL AND PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES ARE BRANCHING_OUT INTO PROGRAMS AIMED AT HELPING THE POOR AND FIGHTING URBAN ILLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of the tumultuous riots that rocked Los Angeles two years ago , evangelical and Pentecostal churches have emerged as major players in shaping a new and pragmatic religious response to urban problems . Long relegated to the fringes of the city ' s political life and viewed_as far more concerned with saving souls than with social_action , these once-insular churches are establishing anti-gang , job training , neighborhood development and a host of other inner-city programs once thought to be the exclusive purview of old-line denominations , a new yearlong study has found . &quot; There ' s been a shift in the balance of leadership , &quot; said USC religion professor Donald E . Miller , one of four co-authors of the $ 115 # 362 study . &quot; Many of the most vigorous , creative new programs are coming_out of evangelical and Pentecostal quarters. &quot; Traditional Protestant_churches , Jewish agencies and large African American congregations remain active in addressing community needs -- and still command the most visibility , the study said . But the trend is toward a growing role for evangelicals and Pentecostalists of all ethnic backgrounds . &quot; I think probably the future rests with those leaders , &quot; UC Santa Barbara religion professor and study co-author Wade Clark Roof said in an interview . Marked by a populist , grass-roots and neighborhood-based approach to pressing urban problems , the heightened activism in Los Angeles reflects a national trend . In cities such_as Miami , Boston , New York and Chicago , there is a new interest and urgency in ministering to the homeless , the poor , the hungry and the jobless on a scale that heretofore characterized efforts of old-line or traditional religious bodies . The new civic activism among evangelicals and Pentecostalists is attributed not only to religious convictions , but to a new confidence that has come_with maturity as their memberships and influence have increased throughout the United States . Since 1960 , for example , the number of denominations affiliated with the National Assn . of Evangelicals has nearly doubled , to 44 denominations representing almost 5 million members . Further , many of their members are located in the cities ' most trouble-plagued districts , requiring local congregations to either adapt their ministries to the times or risk the decline that many old-line denominations , such_as Presbyterians and Episcopalians , have faced . Twelve years ago , the Church of the Nazarene , an evangelical denomination founded 99 years ago in Los Angeles , operated six nonprofit &quot; compassion centers &quot; in the United States to meet inner-city needs . Today there are more_than 75 . &quot; The reality is that evangelical groups are_on the front_lines , &quot; said Michael Mata , former executive_director of the Bresee Institute , one of numerous evangelical-based para-church organizations involved in neighborhood development and job training_programs . Inner-city recipients of these ministries , such_as Kalani Benavides , say that without such neighborhood efforts their lives would be miserable . Benavides , 43 years old and homeless , said she lost her job as a hotel_manager last December . She sleeps on a lawn across the street from the First Church of the Nazarene in the Mid-Wilshire district . &quot; We have a lot of people out here who can ' t survive on_their_own , &quot; she said in an interview . &quot; They need to lean_on someone. &quot; Like 300 others every week , Benavides leans_on the church ' s food program , which serves the homeless , the elderly and families with little or no income . To be sure , not all evangelicals and Pentecostalists have taken_up the urban challenge . Many -- perhaps most -- continue to be suspicious of a &quot; social Gospel , &quot; according to the Rev . Ron Benefiel , senior pastor at the Nazarene congregation , the mother church of the denomination . Both evangelical and Pentecostal Christians continue to place great emphasis on the Gospels ' message of salvation and a personal_relationship with Jesus_Christ . Compared to old-line Christians , they are generally more intent_on seeking converts . In addition , Pentecostalists place special importance on the &quot; gifts of the Holy_Spirit , &quot; such_as speaking in tongues -- ecstatic utterances that are seen by believers as evidence that one has been baptized by the Holy_Spirit . Nonetheless , the study reports a proliferation of inner-city programs . They include Zoe Christian Fellowship ' s entrepreneurial training_school in Compton , the independent Faith Outreach Church ' s anti-gang program in East Los Angeles and the Van Nuys Church on the Way ' s food distribution program . Independent and Pentecostal churches formed the Southern California Coalition of Religious_Leaders , which has organized a credit_union to help minorities start small businesses . Para-church organizations active in inner-city work include World Vision , World Impact and the Bresee Institute . Old-line denominations pioneered and remain active in many of these same ministries . Their most recent and visible program is the Hope in Youth anti-gang program , backed by nine Jewish and Christian denominations and spearheaded by Cardinal Roger M . Mahony , the Roman_Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles . It has a projected five-year , $ 91-million budget . But one distinction continues to separate evangelicals and Pentecostalists from traditional Protestants , Roman_Catholics and Jews . Although all have successfully applied for government grants to operate nonprofit outreach programs , lobbying government for structural changes to root_out the causes of racism and poverty remains the purview of the traditional denominations . Said one confidant of Mayor Richard Riordan , who asked to remain anonymous : &quot; From the perspective I have from the mayor ' s office , I don ' t see them ( evangelicals and Pentecostalists ) at all. &quot; But few old-line religious_leaders disputed the study ' s contention of greater activism by evangelicals and Pentecostalists at the neighborhood level . &quot; I think they are , fortunately , heavily involved , &quot; said the Rev . J . Delton Pickering , executive_director of the United Methodist_Church ' s Council on Ministries in the church ' s California-Pacific Conference . Still , traditional leaders took_issue with what may be the study ' s most controversial finding , one that John B . Orr , professor of religion at USC and chief author of the study , said may require further research . Based on interviews and anecdotal information , the study contends that although there has been a surge in activity by evangelicals and Pentecostalists , a 1960s liberal coalition of Establishment Protestant_denominations , Jewish congregations and civil_rights groups appears to be eroding . It also said that only the Roman_Catholic Archdiocese and , to a lesser extent , Jewish agencies , have been able to maintain the central staffs needed to support the large-scale political leadership that characterized the old liberal coalition . &quot; I just don ' t agree with them , &quot; said the Rt . Rev . Chester Talton , suffragan ( assistant ) bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles . &quot; We are heavily involved , &quot; he said . Talton , and regional officials of the United Methodist_Church and the Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America , said they have experienced no cutbacks in staff for inner-city programs . Only the Presbyterian_Church U.S.A. reported a cutback in its hunger and homeless program . Harvey J . Fields , rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple , a Reform congregation , and chairman of the Interfaith Coalition to Heal L.A. , said old-line denominations remain the dominant players in the city ' s political-religious scene . But he , like the study ' s authors , said something is changing . &quot; It is my sense that what we ' ve got growing at the heart of L.A. right now is a new birth of interfaith cooperation . It is nascent . It needs a lot of culturing . But what is clearly different from the past is a realization that the mainline , traditional religious organizational structure , particularly Christian-Jewish or Protestant-Catholic-Jewish , is simply no longer a fit for Los Angeles. &quot;</TEXT>
