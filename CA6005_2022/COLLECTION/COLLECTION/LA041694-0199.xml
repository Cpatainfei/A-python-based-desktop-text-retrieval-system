   <HEADLINE> DEMOLITION IS URGED FOR TWO CSUN STRUCTURES ; QUAKE : ENGINEERING REPORT SAYS DAMAGES TO PARKING GARAGE AND APARTMENT COMPLEX ARE TOO SEVERE TO REPAIR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The partially collapsed Cal State Northridge parking structure and the seven-story University Tower Apartments sustained such severe damage in the January earthquake that they should be demolished rather than repaired , the university ' s chief damage consultant has recommended . In newly released reports , the Los Angeles-based engineering firm of Law / Crandall Inc. told university officials that it would be difficult to salvage the still-standing portions of the 2 # 500-space garage and that the dormitory is so battered that having repair workers in the building would be hazardous . The two structures are the only ones on the 353-acre campus that the consultant will recommend for demolition , said Chris Baylis , Law / Crandall ' s senior projects manager at CSUN . Even so , university officials said they plan to sponsor additional reviews of the two structures before making final_decisions . In the three months since the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake jolted Southern California and damaged virtually every major building at CSUN , campus officials have consistently maintained that talk_of potential demolitions was premature . The reports estimate the university ' s loss for the two structures alone would be about $ 51.8 million . That is based on estimated replacement_costs of approximately $ 27.3 million for the parking structure , including nearly $ 1.6 million in demolition expenses , and about $ 24.4 million for the high-rise , including $ 1.3 million for demolition and asbestos abatement . On the Northridge campus , students and faculty have widely assumed the remains of the parking structure built_in 1991 -- which became one of the most visible symbols of the quake ' s power -- will be demolished . The Law / Crandall report said about half of the four-level concrete garage on Zelzah Avenue is still standing . The firm ' s report , however , added , &quot; We believe it would be difficult to selectively demolish in_order to reuse parts of the structure &quot; and cited cracks in the exterior concrete columns of the still-standing portions . Therefore , &quot; We are making a preliminary recommendation to demolish the entire structure , &quot; the report said . The tower apartments , built_in the late 1960s but closed since 1991 because of seismic safety and asbestos hazards , sustained &quot; widespread and severe &quot; structural damage in the January quake , according to that building ' s report . In particular , enclosed stairways in the building ' s four wings have separated from the main structure by up_to 8 inches . Even before the quake , university officials had considered demolishing the tower , saying it is too expensive to repair . The Law / Crandall report reinforces that plan , concluding , &quot; Due_to the hazards of working in the damaged structure , the extensive damage and deficiencies in the overall structural system , we do not believe it is reasonable to repair the structure. &quot; * CSUN DAMAGE : Repair estimate tops $ 111 million .
