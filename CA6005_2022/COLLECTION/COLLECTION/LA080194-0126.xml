   <HEADLINE> STARS ADD SPICE TO L.A. OPEN ; TENNIS : CHANG IS SEEDED NO . 1 , BUT FOCUS IS_ON BECKER AND AGASSI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it the new and improved Los Angeles Open . Typically , attending the L.A. Open meant watching Michael Chang wear_down a_few court surfaces every day before losing in the final . The past two years it has meant watching Richard Krajicek of the_Netherlands serve his way to the title . But this year , the $ 325 # 000 tournament , which begins today at the L.A. Tennis Center at UCLA , promises to be different for two reasons : Boris Becker and Andre Agassi . &quot; It ' s definitely a rivalry that people seem to get excited about , &quot; Agassi said . &quot; Every time me and Boris play , it just seems to be the match of the tournament. &quot; Ideally for tournament organizers , second-seeded Becker and third-seeded Agassi would meet in Saturday ' s semifinals . Top-seeded Chang is in the other half of the bracket , with fourth-seeded Alexander Volkov of Russia and fifth-seeded Krajicek . Although it is premature to talk_about the semifinals before the tournament , there is little doubt Becker-Agassi would be the featured matchup . These players share much : They burst onto the scene as teen-agers and achieved pop idol status in their respective countries before struggling with their games . Agassi , ranked No . 20 on the ATP tour , emerged in 1988 at age 18 , when he advanced to the semifinals of the_French Open and the U.S. Open and was ranked No . 3 in the world . Since then , the 1992 Wimbledon champion attracts such a large following at tournaments that it sometimes is difficult for him to fight his way through the crowd to get_to practice courts . Agassi was hampered by a wrist injury last season before undergoing surgery in December . He returned in February and won a tournament at Scottsdale , his last title before he won Sunday at Toronto . The last time Agassi played the L.A. Open was in 1988 , when he lost in the final to Mikael Pernfors of Sweden . Agassi will play his first-round match against No . 84 Nicklas Kulti of Sweden on Tuesday night . Becker , the reclusive German star , won the first of his three Wimbledon titles in 1985 at 17 . Becker had his best year in 1989 , winning his third Wimbledon title as well as the U.S. Open . He reached the No . 1 ranking briefly after winning the Australian Open in 1991 . Becker , ranked ninth , has never played in the L.A. Open . He has returned from a recent leg injury , which prevented him from playing in the Players Limited International in Toronto last week . He will play No . 106 Grant Stafford of South_Africa in a first-round match Tuesday . The Becker-Agassi rivalry is more intriguing because they shared a common coach : Nick Bollettieri , who guided Agassi for 10 years until they split in 1993 . Bollettieri began coaching Becker this year . Agassi is 7-3 against Becker . Their most memorable match , however , was won by Becker , a 6-7 , 6-7 , 7-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 Davis Cup victory that spanned two days in Munich in 1989 and helped West Germany to a 3-2 victory . Although Becker has not beaten Agassi in their seven matches since 1990 , a matchup in the L.A. Open would be a tournament highlight . With the focus_on Becker and Agassi , top-seeded Chang is being overshadowed . Chang , who won the 1989 French Open at 17 , lost in the L.A. Open final in 1989 , 1990 and 1993 . Chang ' s half of the draw seems easier than Becker ' s and Agassi ' s . Chang , ranked sixth , will play 91st-ranked Mark Petchey of England on Tuesday . Krajicek , ranked 26th , will play wild-card entry Michael Joyce , ranked 168th , in a first-round match tonight . Krajicek gained momentum entering the tournament with a 2-6 , 7-5 , 7-6 , 7-5 Davis Cup victory over top-ranked Pete Sampras last month . Sixth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg of Australia might be the player to watch . Stoltenberg , who likely will move_up from his No . 33 ranking today , advanced to the final of a tournament at Washington last month before losing to Stefan Edberg , 6-4 , 6-2 .</TEXT>
