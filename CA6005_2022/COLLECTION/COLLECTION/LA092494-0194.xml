   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE REACHES ACCORD WITH IMF TO START MARKET REFORMS ; EUROPE : NEW PRESIDENT SIGNALS READINESS FOR ECONOMIC OVERHAUL IN EXCHANGE FOR FINANCIAL BACKING FROM WEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new Ukrainian government reached a preliminary accord Friday with the International Monetary Fund to launch market reforms in one of the weakest and most Communist_economies of the former Soviet_Union . The handshake agreement was the first clear sign that President Leonid Kuchma , who took_office two months ago , is ready to move ahead with a promised economic overhaul in return for financial_backing from the West . Lawrence de Milner , the IMF representative in Kiev , announced the agreement after meetings between an IMF official , Peter Hole , and Ukrainian Economics Minister Roman Shpek . If approved by Ukraine ' s Cabinet and the IMF ' s board , De Milner said , the deal could be signed and an initial credit of $ 350 million released as early as next month . In return for the loan , which will bolster its central_bank reserves , Ukraine pledged to tighten fiscal and credit policy , balance the budget , liberalize prices and exchange_rates and ease trade restrictions . Perhaps because the deal is controversial within the government , details were not spelled_out , and no Ukrainian official appeared with De Milner to brief reporters . The IMF program is certain to be unpopular among lawmakers in the Communist-dominated Parliament , among rust-belt industrial directors spoiled by easy government credits and among a semi-criminal elite that is profiting handsomely from Ukraine ' s economic troubles . But Kuchma , the former director of the Soviet_Union ' s largest missile factory , has indicated that he will bypass Parliament if it balks . He told the Interfax news_agency this week that his economic stabilization program , to be announced Oct . 4 and expected to conform_to the IMF deal , is not subject_to lawmakers ' approval . Ukraine ' s Soviet-vintage prime_minister , Vitaly Masol , may also resist the IMF deal . Masol was appointed by Leonid Kravchuk , Kuchma ' s predecessor , to win Communist support in an unsuccessful reelection bid . But Kuchma has been packing the Cabinet with his own appointees , and some politicians believe that Masol ' s days are numbered . Ukraine , with 52 million people , was an industrial powerhouse and the breadbasket of the Soviet_Union . It quickly became a basket case after declaring independence three years ago and losing its cheap sources of energy from Moscow . Its economic troubles have deepened in the last six months while the executive and legislative_branches focused_on their own elections . Masol announced last week that the government was bankrupt and unable to pay its foreign debts , mostly to Russia and Turkmenistan for energy . In a report this week , the International_Labor_Organization said that Ukraine has &quot; the highest level of hidden unemployment in Eastern and Central Europe , the lowest minimum_wage , possibly the greatest degree of poverty and the most alarming growth of open unemployment. &quot; Inflation , which had been reined_in from 80 % a month last fall to less than 2 % in August , is roaring again after Parliament approved a round of agricultural credits . The measures prescribed by the IMF are expected to cause an additional burst of inflation as price_controls come_off . But De Milner said the program also includes measures to protect the poorest from high prices and unemployment .</TEXT>
