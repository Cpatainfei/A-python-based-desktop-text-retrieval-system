   <HEADLINE> NATIONWIDE TRUCKING STRIKE APPROACHES ; NEGOTIATIONS STALLED ; LABOR : COMPANIES SCRAMBLE FOR REPLACEMENT FREIGHT HAULERS . A TEAMSTERS WALKOUT COULD START AS EARLY AS WEDNESDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The growing threat of a nationwide truckers ' strike this week found companies preparing Monday for a possible disruption in freight shipments as contract talks between the Teamsters and trucking firms remained stalled . A strike would leave companies with few viable alternatives if the major trucking_companies were completely shut_down , industry observers said . If successful , a strike could tie_up shipments of a wide range of consumer goods to stores , as well as idle some factories with low inventories . Talks between the Teamsters and Trucking Management Inc. , which represents 23 large trucking firms in_labor negotiations , broke_down last week after the union rejected a proposal that it said would throw members out_of_work and dramatically lower starting pay . No further negotiations have been scheduled . The heads of Teamster locals are scheduled to meet today in Washington , D.C. , to finalize plans for the strike , which union officials said could begin as soon as 12:01 a.m. Wednesday if no settlement is reached . &quot; If there is a strike and if all 23 ( firms ) are shut_down , there would not be enough capacity in the United States to handle that much freight , &quot; said Douglas Rockell , a trucking_industry analyst at Merrill Lynch Research . &quot; It would be fairly nasty. &quot; Companies and consumers depend_on firms like CF Motor Freight , Roadway Express and Yellow Freight for moving everything from coffee_makers to auto parts . The 23 firms control about half of the country ' s mid-size shipments , which are those between 500 and 10 # 000 pounds . Most of the firms , however , are not involved in perishable food shipments . A strike would leave many companies scrambling for space on board the fleets of numerous but much smaller non-union carriers . Companies like United Parcel Service , which usually handle loads of 500 pounds or less , as well as trucking firms that routinely transport more_than 10 # 000 pounds , could also pick_up some business . &quot; We are watching the situation closely , &quot; said Rhea Feldman , a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard , the Palo Alto-based computer maker , which would switch its shipments to carriers unaffected by the strike . Even companies that depend_on non-unionized trucking firms are concerned about the strike . &quot; We would certainly experience some impact because of the increased demand on the carriers we use , &quot; said Kathy Blackburn , a spokeswoman for Mervyns stores . The threat of a strike comes at a pivotal time for both the unionized trucking firms and the Teamsters . The trucking_companies say they need more flexibility in work rules and pay scales to deal with the growth of lower-cost , non-union firms . The Teamsters say the trucking_companies are seeking too drastic concessions of their drivers and dockworkers , 91 % of whom last month authorized the union to call a strike if contract talks failed . In addition to the lower starting pay , the union is upset by employer proposals to cut full-time jobs by adding lower-paid part-time workers , to ship more freight by railroad without safeguarding the jobs of drivers affected by the change and to eliminate the union ' s right to strike over deadlocked grievances . The contract talks come at a time when the 1.4-million-member Teamsters union is crippled by internal warfare , which could complicate its efforts to wage an effective strike . Ron Carey , voted_in as the Teamsters president in 1991 on a pledge to reform the corruption-plagued union , increasingly is being challenged by opponents , including many tied to the organization ' s old-guard leadership . Last month , a dues increase pushed by Carey to replenish the union ' s nearly depleted strike fund was rejected , 3 to 1 . In February , many Teamsters at United Parcel Service defied Carey ' s call to join a strike against that company and reported to work . Some key figures in the Teamsters , however , said the rift within the union would be bridged in this case by the opposition among the rank-and-file to concessions sought by trucking_companies . &quot; I ' ve been at_odds with Carey on a number of issues , but on this issue , I agree with him. &quot; said Chuck Mack , an official with the Western regional conference of the Teamsters . &quot; There are times for politics but not when the members ' livelihoods , and the security of their families ( are at stake ) , and that ' s what we have now. &quot;</TEXT>
