   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 TRYOUT FOLDED IN ENCINITAS IN 1980S ; DESPITE ITS OWN BRUISING CIVIC BATTLE OVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT -- THE CITY KEPT A LOW PROFILE WHEN THE INITIATIVE PUT SIMILAR ISSUES AND A SIMILAR SCENARIO ON THE STATEWIDE STAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In politics , as in theater , there are dress_rehearsals where the plot and the players are displayed before a small audience before moving to the larger arena . Take Proposition 187 , now center stage from Eureka to San Ysidro . If California is Broadway for this political-social-cultural drama , then Encinitas was New Haven . This prosperous seaside suburb of San Diego -- known for its flower fields and youth sports programs and safe neighborhoods -- became the focal_point in the late 1980s for the rising phenomenon in California of civic anger directed at illegal immigrants . There were other communities in San Diego and Orange counties that heard similar complaints from their residents at roughly the same time as Encinitas . But when the television networks , the wire_services and the New York Times wanted to do stories on the growing clash between affluent Southern California homeowners and impoverished immigrants , they came_to Encinitas . The beachfront setting proved journalistically irresistible . For five acrimony-filled years , Encinitas homeowners demanded that City_Hall do something about the groups of young Latino men standing on street_corners soliciting work as day_laborers and camping on private and public_property . A civic ordinance was adopted to penalize employers for hiring illegal immigrants off street_corners , but it was struck_down by a federal judge in 1990 . Those in Encinitas who had complained the loudest about immigrants in their midst reluctantly admitted defeat . * Given that history , you might figure Encinitas would have become a hotbed of Proposition 187 support -- that those same residents and politicians , having seen their efforts thwarted , would have been overjoyed that at long last something was going_to be done to discourage illegal immigration and that the governor was playing a leading role . It didn ' t happen . As the debate flared statewide , Encinitas ( population 57 # 000 ) was_quiet . If anything , the city took an outward attitude of &quot; been there , done that. &quot; &quot; It was surprising what a non-issue 187 was here , &quot; said Gregory Dennis , a free-lance journalist , environmental consultant and Encinitas resident . Catholic and Lutheran ministers in Encinitas and an official from the local synagogue were part of an ecumenical_movement against Proposition 187 , but the City_Council declined to take a stand . There were no campaign signs_on city streets . Although the city decisively supported the initiative at the polls , there were no forums and no large demonstrations . Most of the letters to the local newspaper dealt with a hotly debated local measure about whether to allow construction of a subdivision and golf_course . Ex-Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines , whose high-voltage fights with immigrant advocates were an early indication of the level the emotional rhetoric would reach in the statewide immigration debate , took a hands-off attitude toward Proposition 187 . &quot; I have chosen not to be political , &quot; she said . None of the nine candidates for City_Council was willing to commit the city to another round of trying to rid the streets and canyons of immigrants , even though the legal and political winds now seem to be favoring the employer-sanction approach . &quot; All we got last time was a bunch of bad national publicity , &quot; said Councilman John Davis at a candidates forum . * The issue of newly arrived immigrants living_in tents and cardboard lean-tos was waiting for the first City_Council when the communities of Encinitas , Leucadia , Olivenhain and Cardiff-by-the-Sea incorporated as the city of Encinitas in 1986 to free themselves from the pro-growth attitude of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors . The controversy gave the new city , 25 miles north of San Diego , a sense of being born into crisis . At meetings that went long into the night , residents complained to the fledgling council of trash_heaps , public urination and crime problems . Shop owners complained that their customers were being intimidated . &quot; Nobody saw it coming but then the issue just exploded , &quot; said Dennis , who was managing editor of the North County Blade-Citizen during the controversy . * In retrospect , the scenario appears familiar : Defining illegal immigration as a problem . Declaring a state of emergency . Appealing_to the federal_government for help . Sending the feds a bill . Devising a proposed solution that brought passionate opposition from the editorial pages and cries of racism from immigrant advocates . Protests in the streets . &quot; We never realized we were blazing a trail for the rest of the state , &quot; City_Manager Loren Wasserman said with a touch of sarcasm in his voice . By the standards of Proposition 187 , the Encinitas ordinance was mild . The ordinance would have slapped penalties on those who employ illegal immigrants rather than on the immigrants , the kind of employer-sanction approach that even some opponents of Proposition 187 say is needed . It was also part of a compromise whereby the city opened a hiring hall for documented immigrants , the first such hall in San Diego County , to ensure that employers would treat their day_laborers fairly . Pam Slater , who was_on the Encinitas council and now is a county supervisor , says that if the Encinitas ordinance had been allowed to stand and been copied by other communities , it might have averted the political upheaval that led to passage of Proposition 187 . &quot; We thought we were going_in the right direction ( with the ordinance and hiring hall ) , but the migrant advocates blocked us at every turn , &quot; Slater said . &quot; And they got Proposition 187 as a result. &quot; A differing view comes from Claudia Smith , attorney for the California Rural League Assistance , which along with the American Civil Liberties Union sued to overturn the Encinitas ordinance and prevent the idea from spreading to other California communities . To Smith , Encinitas residents were unwilling to accept the &quot; shared humanity &quot; of the immigrants . &quot; To me , I thought it offended their aesthetic sensibilities to see these men standing out there , &quot; she said . The years since the lawsuit have not softened Smith ' s view of Encinitas . She is still suing the city over its refusal to provide immigrant housing . She refuses to shop in the city . &quot; I refuse to patronize Encinitas , &quot; she said . &quot; I hate Encinitas. &quot; * A city , of course , is more_than just the sum of its public_debates , and Encinitas has flourished despite the divisiveness of the immigration fight . New subdivisions have the scrubbed , cheery look of the archetypal Southern California neighborhood in &quot; E.T. , &quot; a paradise for kids on bikes . The median resale price of a home is $ 295 # 000 . Traffic is still a hassle along the commercial intersection of Encinitas Boulevard and El Camino Real , but a good Cajun restaurant has opened along Pacific Coast Highway and the new athletic club , Frog ' s , received an award for architectural comeliness . As for why Encinitas opted out of the Proposition 187 battle , it is anybody ' s guess . Dennis believes that the city has decided to give tolerance a chance and learn to live with the young_men who still gather on street_corners in the morning . &quot; People came_to understand that most of these guys are just looking_for a job , &quot; he said . Gaines , who was defeated for reelection during the controversy , leans toward the idea that its five-year civic battle left Encinitas too exhausted over the topic to get emotionally involved in the fight again . And she notes , with some irony , how the issue that cost her her political career has now moved to a bigger stage : &quot; It ' s strange , all_the things we said then are what a lot of people are saying now. &quot;</TEXT>
