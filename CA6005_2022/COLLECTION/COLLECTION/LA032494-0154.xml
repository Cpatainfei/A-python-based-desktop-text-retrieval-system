   <HEADLINE> CANDIDATE TO LEAD MEXICO IS SHOT ; PRESIDENCY : RULING PARTY ' S LUIS DONALDO COLOSIO IS HIT IN HEAD AND CHEST AFTER TIJUANA SPEECH . CROWD SURGES AROUND AND DETAINS TWO SUSPECTED ASSAILANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two gunmen stepped from a crowd Wednesday and shot and seriously wounded Luis Donaldo Colosio , the presidential candidate of Mexico ' s ruling party who was campaigning in a poor area of this border city , authorities said . Details of the condition of Colosio -- who is 44 and was widely expected to be elected president of Mexico during national elections scheduled for Aug . 21 -- were not immediately available . But he reportedly suffered wounds to the head and chest and was taken from the scene bleeding profusely . Mexican radio carried urgent appeals for a rare blood_type for transfusion . Colosio was rushed to Tijuana ' s General Hospital , but reports indicated that he was to be transported via helicopter to nearby UC San Diego Medical_Center . The candidate was shot after a campaign speech in the neighborhood of Lomas Taurinas , near Tijuana ' s international airport . The furious Tijuana crowd , estimated at 3 # 000 people , surged around his apparent assailants , beating them and detaining them , according to broadcast reports . Their identities were not immediately available , but television broadcasts from the chaotic scene showed the alleged assailants as mustachioed men who appeared to be in their 20s . One of the men appeared bloodied and disheveled as a gun-wielding man -- possibly a security_guard who was trying to ward_off further attacks on the assailant -- battled members of the crowd . Wednesday ' s attack promised to create further turmoil for Mexico ' s Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI , as it is known . The party , which has ruled Mexico for more_than six decades , was badly embarrassed earlier this year by an Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas that left at least 145 people dead . Rebel leaders are now considering details of a tentative peace accord . Colosio ' s shooting stunned Mexico , a nation of 92 million that had hardly recovered from the shock of the New Year ' s Day rebellion in Chiapas . His shooting came one day after Manuel Camacho Solis , the government peace envoy in Chiapas , announced that he would not run_for president . The prospective candidacy of Camacho Solis -- Colosio ' s chief rival within the PRI -- had threatened to split the ruling party since January . Tension about August ' s elections has been mounting steadily since the insurrection in Chiapas . The rebels have called_for broad national reform toward true democracy , and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has pledged reforms in the electoral process . Mexican lawmakers are considering a broad package of reforms . Among other things , the proposed changes would make electoral authorities more independent of the PRI and other parties , stiffen penalties for voter fraud and modify the ballots to prevent ballot-stuffing . Colosio , an amiable politician whose open manner contrasted with the stiff persona of many Mexican lawmakers , has been controversial ever since he was named as the party ' s candidate Nov . 28 . Salinas , exercising a longstanding prerogative of Mexican presidents , personally chose Colosio -- one of his longtime proteges -- as his successor , passing_over Camacho Solis and other rivals . Critics complained that Colosio ' s adherence to free_trade and other policies too closely mimicked the neo-liberal economic blueprint of Salinas . Since the Chiapas rebellion , Colosio -- a native of the border state of Sonora -- had been distancing himself somewhat from Salinas ' economic plans , stressing the need to help the great numbers of poverty-stricken Mexicans . But Colosio has long had many defenders within the structure of the PRI , which has been synonymous with government here since its founding in 1929 . Party stalwarts favored him for the presidency , confident that he would do nothing to erode the PRI ' s longtime dominance . Before being named the PRI ' s presidential candidate , Colosio headed Mexico ' s vast Social Development secretariat , which included a multibillion-dollar anti-poverty initiative called Solidarity . In the wake of the Chiapas rebellion , many criticized Solidarity as a program that did little to resolve the pressing problems of rural and urban poverty that still characterize Mexico . Colosio had served as a PRI senator and chairman of the national party . An economist , Colosio is a native of Magdalena del Kino , near the Arizona border . He did postgraduate work_at the University of Pennsylvania and in Austria . In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States was &quot; horrified by this brutal assassination attempt. &quot; &quot; We very much hope that he is able to recover fully from this attack and resume his distinguished career , &quot; McCurry said .</TEXT>
