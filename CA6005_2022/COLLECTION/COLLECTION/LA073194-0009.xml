   <HEADLINE> SHADOWS IN A NEW LAND ; THE MARKS OF BIRTH , BY PABLO MEDINA ( FARRAR , STRAUS AND GIROUX : $ 22 ; 276 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Critics of mainstream publishing ' s attitude toward minority authors have long pointed_out that the industry is interested only in ethnic autobiography . Certainly this genre makes_up a large part of what is best in the growing body of Latino literature , from Rudolfo Anaya ' s &quot; Bless Me , Ultima &quot; and Richard Rodriguez ' s &quot; Hunger of Memory &quot; to Sandra Cisneros ' &quot; The House on Mango Street &quot; and Julia Alvarez ' s &quot; How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accent. &quot; But given the rapid proliferation of this genre , one can ' t help but wonder upon opening this latest installment : Can yet another Latino coming-of-age novel possibly be fresh ? Initially , Pablo Medina ' s &quot; The Marks of Birth &quot; seems to tell a tale common to all_of these more or less autobiographical first novels : a young_person born abroad migrates with his family to the U.S. -- or is born within a Latino family that is &quot; abroad &quot; even within America ' s shores . Here he wrestles with the alienation of having been born and raised within a foreign culture and in the process learns to be an American with a difference . A Latino American . Grouped together , these books could compose a saga titled &quot; Birth of a Subnation. &quot; But while Medina ' s novel tells this same story , his style is altogether different . For one thing , Medina ' s narrative lacks the candor found in other Latino fictionalized autobiographies , in which one can feel the author palpitating right under the surface of the discourse . &quot; Marks of Birth &quot; puts a greater distance between author and text , and , therefore , between author and reader . One does not get_to know Medina through his Anton , a character who remains a mystery until the very end . But then Anton is not the kind of character one is meant to know in the sense one knows the protagonists of realist fiction . He has not been brought_to life with psychological detail ; instead , he wears a birthmark shaped like some kind of map that flares_up in moments of crisis . To find Anton ' s literary antecedents one should look_to the heroes of the medieval romance or Baroque fable rather than to the fleshed-out characters of the 19th-Century novel . However , he is the heir to a kind of coming-of-age narrative that flourished in Romantic and realist European fiction and which would become firmly rooted in Medina ' s native soil . Cuban literature did not invent the Bildungsroman -- to call the coming-of-age tale by its more distinguished name . It is a genre that traces its origins to a variety of early forms of narratives , including the Spanish picaresque novel , and that , once realism played itself out , became emblematic of European modernism . Only two Old_World titles need be mentioned : &quot; Portrait of the Artist as a Young_Man &quot; and &quot; Remembrances of Things Past. &quot; Although to place Medina ' s novel in its proper context , one needs to think also of two Cuban titles : Alejo Carpentier ' s &quot; Explosion in a Cathedral &quot; and Jose Lezama Lima ' s &quot; Paradiso. &quot; Both of these books , written by authors in the full bloom of their mature artistic powers , not by youths new_to the writing profession , place their protagonists in the heart of bourgeois families that are nearly self-contained micro-universes , the kind of setting that is rich soil for the ripening of complex , observant , eclectic personalities . And in both , the protagonist ' s journey toward self-knowledge moves_in counterpoint through both familial and social history . Typically , Carpentier , though majestically at_ease with cultural history , is more fascinated with the political side of social history , while Lezama , the great aesthete , is more engaged with the process of culture , a kind of a historical history . In Medina ' s tale , the history that knocks_against the slow , rich unfolding of familial and personal growth is definitely political -- more precisely , the politics of the Cuban revolution . But Medina has chosen to take an almost anti-historical tack by not calling the most important event in his native country ' s young life -- Cuba is barely a century-old republic -- by its name . Cuba itself is called &quot; the island , &quot; while its revolutionary leader is named &quot; Campeon. &quot; It ' s a happy artistic maneuver , for it drains the Cuban Revolution of its excessive power of signifying and allows the protagonist to wrestle with History with a capital H , not just the Revolution with a capital R , which is , after all , but a small chunk of History . Medina cuts the Cuban Revolution down to size and by doing so takes History by storm , ripping it from the arrogant hands of its epic manipulators and putting it at the service of culture . And what simple truths a novelist can tell once he has divorced political &quot; reality. &quot; Here is Felicia , the family matriarch , evaluating her &quot; island ' s &quot; revolutionary leader : &quot; The worst thing that could happen to a country was for a rich boy to take it over in the name of the oppressed. &quot; Best of all is that a novelist can do directly what a historian must labor endlessly to elucidate . The books that analyze the phenomenon of Cuban Miami add_up by now to an American sub-genre , yet Medina in just two paragraphs gets_it absolutely right : &quot; Miami in those days was a bleached bone stretching west and south from Biscayne Bay , as if it wanted nothing to do with the sea . Its topography , or lack of it , its square , dull houses , and the grid layout of its streets were perfectly suited for exiles who did not want to be distracted from the past and from the delectable contemplation of their memories . They made_sure that whatever life they had in the new land was a mere shadow of what they had left_behind . They bought used cars and fixed them superficially so that they were constantly breaking_down . If it wasn ' t the carburetor , it was the alternator ; if it wasn ' t the alternator , it was the valves . ' The Studebakers and Packards of the Island , ' they would reminisce . ' Those were real cars. ' Their houses , too , were weak , unstable things . Any strong wind would call their permanence into question . ' Nothing , ' they would say , surveying the ruins after a hurricane , ' can compare to the buildings of our land . They were built to last . Even the trees here topple over as if they had no roots. ' &quot; The truth was that nothing and no one in Miami had any roots . The city was built_on water -- or more accurately , the water had been drained from the land so that the city could exist . Left to its own devices , the water would seep back in and the land would revert to swamp and mangrove . Exiles were the perfect denizens of such a place , and they were making Miami , with the ocean on one side and the Everglades on the other , a fervent distorted image of the larger , more permanent island they had left behind. &quot; Felicia ' s move to Miami caps the family ' s exile from the island ; like most Cuban families they leave their country individually or in nuclear_family units only to be reunited in the United States and then be dispersed again by this country ' s centrifugal power . The grand bourgeois family -- although Felicia ' s is grand in_depth and complexity , not wealth -- is not possible here . Thus , the cultivation of a personality like Anton is not possible either . Which is to say that to reinvent the Cuban Bildungsroman in exile is to do war with the impossible , and , in Medina ' s case , to win . Anton tries to be American . He goes_about it with the self-contained patience of a hero in a Puritan morality tale . And he succeeds to a certain extent . Toward the end of the book , Anton has become a lean spirit , cultivating his garden ( one of the many acknowledgments that Medina grounds his tale in fables like Voltaire ' s &quot; Candide &quot; ) and living a marital life that borders_on asceticism . In fact , his heart is cloven by love for two kinds of aesthetes : his American wife , whose singing of the Shaker hymn &quot; Tis a Gift to Be Simple &quot; labels her as a Protestant Everywoman , and a Cuban -- er , &quot; islander &quot; -- of austere political vision whose dedication to overthrowing Castro -- er , &quot; Campeon &quot; -- leads Anton to join a paramilitary group training to invade the island . The aesthetic remove of Medina ' s art applies to every aspect of island politics , and he is no more sympathetic toward the anti-Campeon factions than toward the island ' s triumphant revolutionaries . All politics , in fact , appears as a dangerous mixture of bluster and betrayal , with only one character , the enigmatic Spaniard Jose Maria Unanue , standing_for a kind of political integrity . Fittingly , he is as disillusioned as he is true , a perfect stoic , although how he manages to know and accomplish so_much -- he sneaks Anton and his parents out of the island -- shrouds him in a veil of suspicion . Jose Maria , in a way , is a kind of father figure , as is Anton ' s uncle Antonio -- Anton ' s true father is rather ineffectual . Antonio , charming and clever as he is , is a man_of_action , albeit failed political action , not letters , and his nephew is not destined to become a writer -- it ' s grandmother Felicia who by writing Anton ' s biography becomes a kind of literary fairy godmother within the novel . Anton too must act , must do the right thing . That the right thing is an absurd thing is fitting in this novel in which political action is always absurd or has absurd consequences : Medina reduces his native country ' s revolution to a grand absurdity . In the end , Anton is ready . The island is ready . The family ' s evolution had led him to the move he must make . &quot; The Marks of Birth &quot; is a gloriously reactionary piece of fiction in which history lacks the power of family , politics pales before imagination , revolution is but one more trial on_the_road to redemption , and dialectics can be flipped_over like a turtle by a personality that comes_to understand destiny .</TEXT>
