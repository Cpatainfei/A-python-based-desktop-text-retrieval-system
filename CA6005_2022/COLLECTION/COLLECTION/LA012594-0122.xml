   <HEADLINE> BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS REPORTS $ 37.6-MILLION LOSS AFTER CHARGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beckman Instruments Inc. said it lost $ 37.6 million in 1993 after taking a $ 115-million charge against the cost of a two-year restructuring program that will lop about 800 jobs from its worldwide payroll . Before the charge -- the largest of two annual charges the company plans to take -- Beckman earned $ 46.8 million from ongoing operations , up nearly 7 % from $ 43.8 million in 1992 . The annual loss amounts to $ 1.35 per share , compared to a profit of $ 1.53 a share , or $ 43.8 million , in 1992 . To fully account_for the costs of the restructuring , which it announced in October , Beckman said it will take a further $ 20-million charge this year . A spokesman for the medical_instruments maker said Monday that about 350 of the jobs to be cut will come from the company ' s California operations and will result from a combination of an early-retirement plan , normal attrition and , if necessary , layoffs . The remaining jobs will be cut from payrolls in the company ' s divisions in Europe , which has been hard hit by a recession . Specifics of the job cut plan have not been made public . Beckman has 6 # 600 employees , including 4 # 500 in the United State . Of those , 1 # 700 are in Orange County at the corporate headquarters and bio-technology instrumentation facility in Fullerton and a diagnostics instruments plant in Brea ; and 1 # 110 are in Northern California , predominantly at Beckman ' s Palo Alto research and manufacturing_plant for its centrifuge division . Beckman officials said a number of other jobs , mostly in Europe , will be affected by the restructuring as positions are transferred among locations . &quot; We expect that many of the people will not want to transfer , &quot; said spokesman Jay Steffenhagen . &quot; Those jobs will be filled , but the people holding them will change. &quot; The company ' s financial report held no surprises , said John Putnam , a medical technology analyst with the Alex . Brown &amp; Sons investment research company . &quot; They announced their reorganization in October , so the charge was anticipated . It is part of what the good companies are doing_in the health_care area right now . They are getting costs under_control to reflect an evolving environment. &quot; Louis T . Rosso , Beckman ' s chairman and chief_executive , said Monday that the company expects its reorganization to &quot; begin paying dividends with significant savings in 1994. &quot; Beckman is shifting focus to its medical diagnostics and centrifuge devices operations . &quot; We are putting our investment in our bio-technology businesses , because that is the fastest-growing part &quot; of the market , Steffenhagen said . Sales for the company ' s U.S. diagnostic systems unit grew 5 % . Beckman officials have said that the restructuring is a response to numerous factors including the European recession and medical cost containment efforts overseas and in America . Because the recession in Europe lowered the value of many currencies when converted to U.S. dollars , Beckman said its annual sales dropped 3.6 % to $ 875.7 million from $ 908.8 million in 1992 . Had currency values remained unchanged from 1992 levels , the company said , its sales would have increased by about 1 % . Beckman Reports Loss Beckman Instruments Inc. reported a $ 67-million loss for the fourth quarter , giving the company a $ 37.6-million loss for 1993 . The company attributed the shortfall to a one-time , $ 115-million restructuring charge .
