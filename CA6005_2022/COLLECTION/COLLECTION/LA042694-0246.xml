   <TEXT> The city of Santa Clarita will celebrate the reopening of City_Hall , which suffered millions of dollars in damage during the Northridge earthquake , with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday . The reopening of City_Hall should come as a relief to the public and to city officials and staff who were forced to work_out of trailers and tents in the City_Hall parking_lot for more_than two weeks following the January temblor . The city subsequently moved its offices to temporary quarters off Golden Triangle Road in Saugus , where they have been located during the reconstruction process . Repairs_to the City_Hall building at 23920 Valencia Blvd. , which suffered an estimated $ 4.5 million in damage during the quake , were completed on_time and on budget , said Gail Foy , a city spokeswoman . Over the last three months , 41 steel-reinforcement beams have been added_to make the building 25 % stronger , Foy said . The building also received a fresh coat_of_paint and new carpet . City workers are scheduled to pack office materials Friday and have their belongings moved to City_Hall over the weekend so that they can unpack Monday . The reopening ceremony coincides with a revised work schedule for city staff and officials . In an effort to reduce pollution by taking cars off the road , city employees will begin working nine-hour days , allowing City_Hall to close every_other Friday . The new hours are 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on alternate Fridays . The new schedule allows the city to comply with South Coast Air Quality Management District regulations that call_for a reduction in the number of vehicles traveling at peak hours . The City_Council ' s 7 p.m. meeting tonight is scheduled to take_place in the City_Hall building ' s council_chambers .</TEXT>
