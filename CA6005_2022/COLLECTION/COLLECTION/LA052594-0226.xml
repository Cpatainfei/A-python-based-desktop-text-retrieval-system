   <HEADLINE> IRAQ ROCKETS BATHED U.S. TROOPS IN CHEMICALS , SENATOR REPORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. troops were directly exposed to chemical_agents , mostly from rocket attacks , on more_than a dozen occasions during the Gulf War , a congressional report claims in concluding that such agents are a cause of illnesses afflicting thousands of veterans . The 160-page report , to be released today by Sen . Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , includes testimony from 30 Gulf War veterans who say that apparent Iraqi missile attacks were followed by chemical_agent detectors sounding , the air filling with fumes and burning sensations on their skin . Almost all now suffer from the debilitating symptoms of what has come_to be known as Persian_Gulf Syndrome . Riegle , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , holds hearings today with Pentagon and intelligence agency officials on the report . Defense officials say there is no evidence of Iraqi chemical or biological attacks . The report concludes that , despite Pentagon claims to the contrary , &quot; there is substantial evidence supporting claims that U.S. servicemen and women were exposed to low-level chemical_warfare agents and possibly biological agents and toxins from a variety of sources. &quot; Riegle said his yearlong investigation included interviews with 600 American troops , many of whom corroborated reports of chemical exposures . One soldier stationed in Saudi_Arabia reported a loud explosion early in the morning of Jan . 17 , 1991 , followed by a sounding of alarms and a burning sensation on his face . Two days later in another part of Saudi_Arabia , witnesses reported a sharp odor of ammonia after a &quot; real bad explosion &quot; and more alarms going_off . A soldier based near King Fahd International Airport on Jan . 20 , 1991 , said he saw what he believed to be a Scud missile shot down by a Patriot missile . He experienced &quot; a very strong raunchy taste , like very bitter burnt toast &quot; in his mouth . He now suffers from bleeding , dizziness , hair loss , joint pain , insomnia and blurred vision , symptoms common to many returning from the Gulf . Despite the numerous chemical alerts , troops were told by their commanding_officers that the explosions came from sonic_booms .</TEXT>
