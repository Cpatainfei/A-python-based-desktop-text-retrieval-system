   <TEXT> Josiah Andrew Alvarado is buried on a grassy slope in the Hollywood Hills , in the shadow of a stand of giant pine_trees and pink-blooming oleanders . His is a simple grave , marked by a brass tablet bearing a quote from Psalms and figures befitting a child just shy of his eighth birthday : a goose and rabbit , a cherub , teddy_bear and lamb . His mother doesn ' t come_to the cemetery much . Visiting is too painful . It has been five years since her only child , a hemophiliac , died of AIDS . Today , Joan Alvarado is brokenhearted , bitter and angry -- at the doctors she feels betrayed her , at the manufacturer of the blood concentrate that should have saved Josiah ' s life but infected him with the human_immunodeficiency_virus instead , and paradoxically at herself , for unknowingly administering the deadly infusion . &quot; I struggle with that every day of my life , even though intellectually I know it wasn ' t my fault , &quot; she said . &quot; What makes you angry is you put your trust in these people . They did nothing but lie to me . Nobody told me death was a side_effect of this concentrate . Yes , it was a wonderful product . Yes , he needed it . But they helped me murder my son. &quot; The death of Josiah Alvarado speaks volumes about the tragic link between AIDS and hemophilia . Through tainted blood products distributed in the early 1980s , HIV has decimated the hemophiliac population in the United States and other developed nations that imported the U.S.-made concentrate . A decade later , the death toll is mounting . Survivors , many of whom remained silent for fear that they would be stigmatized , are now going public and fighting_back . In the United States , officials estimate that half the 20 # 000 hemophiliacs are HIV-positive , and the infection rate is 80 % in those with severe forms of the blood-clotting disorder . By the end of 1993 , the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention had documented 3 # 342 AIDS cases among hemophiliacs . As a result of the epidemic , the median life_expectancy of a person with hemophilia declined from 57 years in 1979 to 40 in 1989 . Families are being wiped_out . Wives of hemophiliacs ( the disorder is genetic , passed from mother to son , and afflicts men almost exclusively ) have contracted AIDS from their husbands , or passed HIV to their children . Generations are disappearing . In San Bernardino County , a couple had four sons with hemophilia . Three are dead and the fourth is HIV-positive . AIDS has also claimed two of the wife ' s hemophiliac brothers , and her nephew is infected . Said the husband : &quot; You ' re constantly worried about one and grieved about the other. &quot; Amid this &quot; hemophiliac holocaust , &quot; as some have called it , there is a growing movement to avenge the deaths through lawsuits and legislation . It has been a time-consuming and emotional campaign . Often , it has not been successful . In Los Angeles , lawyers for Joan Alvarado and her husband , Tim , spent five grueling weeks this summer trying to persuade a Superior_Court jury that Baxter Hyland Therapeutics , one of four companies that manufactured the concentrate , was responsible_for Josiah ' s death by failing to take adequate precautions to keep HIV out of its products . But the case , like so many others brought by hemophiliacs , was extremely difficult to prove , and the couple lost -- as have the plaintiffs in all but one of 11 other cases that have gone_to trial . In Chicago , however , hemophiliacs recently scored a legal victory : This month , a judge ruled that there was enough evidence for a group called the Committee of Ten Thousand ( COTT ) -- named for the 10 # 000 infected -- to bring a class-action lawsuit against the manufacturers and , ironically , the nonprofit National Hemophilia Foundation . The suit alleges that the foundation , like the companies , knew the blood products were risky but failed to warn its members because it received funding from the manufacturers . While the foundation has declined comment , the manufacturers have denied wrongdoing , saying the infections occurred long before anyone knew that the blood supply was unsafe and thus could not have been prevented . &quot; Everyone understands what a terrible tragedy this is , what a horrible disaster this has been for the community , &quot; said Duncan Barr , attorney for Miles Inc. , one of the pharmaceutical company defendants . &quot; But the fact that something bad happened doesn ' t necessarily mean that it is someone ' s fault. &quot; Yet the Committee of Ten Thousand says fault abounds , not only with the companies , but with the federal_government , for failing to protect the blood supply in the epidemic ' s early days . Already , the committee ' s efforts have sparked an inquiry by the Institute of Medicine -- the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences -- into how the products became tainted ; a hearing is set_in Washington for Sept . 12 . And the advocacy group is pressing Congress to make reparations to infected hemophiliacs , noting that most Western nations -- including Canada , Spain , the United Kingdom and France -- have done so . Its harshest criticism , however , is reserved for the manufacturers . Two companies , Baxter Hyland and Rhone Poulenc Rorer , together have offered to pay $ 30 # 000 to each infected person -- not to admit guilt but simply to settle the lawsuit . &quot; An insult , &quot; is how one COTT board_member described the offer . When the judge ruled that the lawsuit could go_forward , the settlement collapsed . &quot; This was 100 % avoidable , &quot; said Jonathan Wadleigh , a Massachusetts computer salesman who , angry over his own HIV infection , founded COTT in 1990 . &quot; I ' m a business person , and I understand sales . But I also understand the value of human life and ethics . These companies put their profit before human lives . They should be held accountable for what they did , and we intend to hold them accountable. &quot; * No lawsuit , of course , will bring_back Josiah Alvarado . Nor has the legal_system done much to ease the pain of his parents , who have forced themselves to relive the details of their child ' s death through a trial that yielded little but sorrow . Seared in their consciousness are terrible images of the fair-haired little boy with the impish grin , the boy they named after a faithful Old_Testament king . There was Josiah , asking what it feels_like to die . There was Josiah , telling his mother jokes so she would n ' t be so sad . There was Josiah , struggling to walk on the final day of his life , June 21 , 1989 , a Wednesday , the first day of summer . &quot; It ' s been like trying to heal but you can ' t , &quot; Tim Alvarado said , as the jury deliberated . &quot; They ( Baxter Hyland lawyers ) are just trampling over our son ' s grave . You just want to stand_up and scream and yell at them and say : ' Maybe this doesn ' t mean anything to you . You get_to go_home and play with your children and watch them grow . But what do we have ? We have nothing . Our lives are destroyed. ' &quot; Now that they know Joan Alvarado carries the hemophilia gene , the couple has decided against having other children . Although they sometimes talk_about adoption , they feel they must first get Josiah ' s death behind them . &quot; I ' m stuck_in the reliving , &quot; Joan Alvarado said . &quot; I don ' t have a happy memory of my son . All I see is the pain , the suffering. &quot; As she spoke , she hugged her own slender frame , wrapping her empty arms tightly around her waist . Since Josiah died , she explained , she does not know quite what to do with them . * If there is a bitter irony in the story of Josiah and the thousands of other hemophiliacs with HIV , it is this : The very product that has cut their lives short revolutionized the treatment for their age-old disorder , holding the promise that for the first time , hemophiliacs could live a normal life . Contrary to popular belief , people with hemophilia do not bleed faster , nor do they die from simple cuts or scrapes . They bleed longer , because their plasma , a blood component , is missing proteins -- called &quot; factors &quot; -- that facilitate clotting . Those with Hemophilia_A , the most common form , lack Factor 8 . Those with Hemophilia_B , which afflicted Josiah , lack Factor 9 . Internal bleeding from bumps and bruises , especially head injuries , is the biggest danger . Nonetheless , as recently as four decades ago , many hemophiliacs made_it past childhood . Those who lived longer often suffered crippling deformities in the knees , ankles and other joints where blood pooled . But the image of the hemophiliac as a frail , homebound child is outdated because of dramatic advances in treatment since the 1950s , when blood_transfusions were the only option . Transfusions were ineffective and dangerous ; huge volumes of blood were required to get a small amount of clotting factor , and patients sometimes suffered heart_failure as a result . Then came fresh frozen plasma , until the 1960s when -- after a freezer failure in which the plasma turned_to slush -- scientists discovered that clotting factor could be separated from plasma . But the resulting &quot; cryoprecipitate &quot; was slow to administer and difficult to store , and patients often suffered severe bleeding by the time they got_to the hospital for treatment . In the 1970s came factor concentrate -- a freeze-dried form of Factor 8 and Factor 9 , packaged in tiny vials of powder that were mixed with saline_solution . It was convenient , stable and easy to use . No longer would patients have to rush to the emergency_room ; they could be treated at_home . Even better , the factor concentrates could be given prophylactically . A hemophiliac could play soccer or any other sport ; he or his parents would infuse the factor_in advance . &quot; It was a revolution in quality_of_life , &quot; said Dr. Peter Smith , a hemophilia expert at Brown University . &quot; Once you had a portable , practical , easily stored factor , people could pop that in their car . They could go_on vacations when they never dared to do that . &quot; Fathers could move onto a different job because they knew how to treat their child . Mothers could get a job themselves because they didn ' t always have to worry , waiting for the call from school that something had happened to Johnny. &quot; * Factor concentrate so dramatically altered the outlook for hemophiliacs that in 1981 , when the Alvarados learned their infant son suffered from the disorder , a nurse told them that if he had to pick a disease for his own child , he would choose hemophilia because it was so easy to treat . So the Alvarados followed the medical mantra of the day : Treat early and often . But there was a problem with the concentrate : Unlike cryoprecipitate , which was drawn from a single donor , Factor 8 and Factor 9 were drawn from the pooled plasma of up_to 20 # 000 donors . Most donors were paid ; some were prisoners , others lived_on Skid_Row . Lawyers for the Alvarados say Baxter should have known that taking plasma from such high-risk groups was dangerous . Baxter attorney Rick Berkman counters : &quot; Nobody ever said that poor people transmit AIDS. &quot; As important as who the plasma came from was that it came from so many people , any one of whom could taint the entire batch . Indeed , by the late 1970s it was clear that the concentrates were transmitting disease -- not AIDS , which no one knew about , but a new strain of hepatitis later known as Hepatitis C . The concentrate was so rife_with hepatitis that , in experiments at the CDC , scientists used Factor 8 to infect chimps . Still , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not yank the factor off the shelves ; the prevailing sentiment was that the benefits outweighed the risk . This baffles Dr. Donald Francis , the former CDC official who has been lionized for his unsuccessful efforts to make the blood supply safe in the early days of the AIDS epidemic . &quot; Here you had this stuff that was filthy and yet was allowed to go_through , &quot; Francis said . &quot; We knew that this stuff infected every single person who used it ( with hepatitis ) . I guess that was acceptable when you thought the disease was mild. &quot; The experience with hepatitis looms large in the legal wrangling over whether the pharmaceutical companies did enough to keep their products clean . In 1981 -- three years before the AIDS virus was discovered -- a German firm patented a method of heat-treating the concentrate to rid the factor of hepatitis . But U.S. manufacturers did not employ the method . They argued that such treatments -- which involved heating the concentrate to at least 148 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 to 144 hours -- altered the composition of the factor so that it could no longer be produced in large enough quantities to meet patient needs . Had they done so , many hemophiliacs would have been spared . Heat-treating , the companies later learned , kills HIV . Moreover , hepatitis was prevalent among homosexuals , who were also at risk for AIDS . Although there was no AIDS test in the epidemic ' s early days , lawyers for the Alvarados say that if a donor had hepatitis , he probably carried the AIDS virus too . They say Baxter should have questioned donors more thoroughly about their sexual practices , and should have tested plasma for hepatitis antibodies as a &quot; surrogate marker &quot; for AIDS . But Baxter never used the surrogate test . Arthur Grebow , a lawyer for the Alvarados , says the company was too cheap to use it . &quot; They knew they ' d have to go_out and replace the donors , &quot; he said , &quot; and that was going_to be costly. &quot; Berkman , the Baxter attorney , counters with studies showing that hepatitis was not a good marker for AIDS . Moreover , he says , the antibodies served a useful purpose -- they helped kill_off any active hepatitis virus that slipped into the concentrate . And , he says , the FDA never required the test . &quot; If you get past the smears and go_to the hard data , &quot; Berkman said , &quot; there is no evidence that anything we did caused this boy to be infected. &quot; * Caught in the middle of this lawyers ' duel are the Alvarados . They are a quiet couple who live_in an apartment not far from the Beverly Center . Joan , 42 , recently took a job as a paralegal for Grebow ' s firm ; Tim , 39 , repairs home security_systems . They came_to Grebow a year after Josiah died , on the recommendation of a friend . Unlike Berkman , who works for a high-powered Philadelphia firm and recites medical terms with the fluency of a doctor , Grebow knew_nothing of AIDS or hemophilia . He is a business lawyer , and his partner is a tax attorney . They knew only that the Alvarados had a tragic story , and so they agreed to take the case on contingency . Winning required convincing a jury of two points : that Baxter was negligent by accepting prison plasma , failing to use the hepatitis surrogate test and not screening donors effectively ; and that Baxter ' s product -- and not one manufactured by another company -- infected Josiah . It was this last point that tripped_up the jury , according to both sides . Joan Alvarado kept a meticulous infusion log ; each time she gave Josiah factor concentrate , she noted the date , the lot number of the product and the name of the manufacturer . The log for the first five months of 1984 -- when the Alvarados believe their son was infected -- lists only one product : Baxter Hyland Lot 2808 X018 AA . During the trial , two top AIDS experts -- Dr. Michael Gottlieb , who identified the earliest AIDS cases , and Dr. Steven Miles of UCLA -- testified that Josiah was almost certainly infected between February and April , 1984 . It was then , the doctors said , that Josiah exhibited the acute flu-like symptoms that appear when blood &quot; seroconverts &quot; -- becomes HIV-positive . Baxter countered with evidence that Josiah showed similar symptoms earlier , and the jury apparently could not agree on the date of infection . On Aug . 17 , after four days of deliberations , they voted_in favor of the defense . The Alvarados and their lawyers were stunned . &quot; To me , &quot; Joan Alvarado said , &quot; it seems like they have gotten_away with murder. &quot; * Few hemophiliacs have been infected with the AIDS virus since 1985 , when the test to detect it was developed . There have been no seroconversions since 1987 , according to the National Hemophilia Foundation . Since then , there has been another round of improvements in the manufacturing of factor concentrate : At the minimum , products are heat-treated and go_through other purification processes . And there is an even safer way to make Factor 8 , through genetic_engineering . This new &quot; recombinant &quot; factor , available since December , 1992 , is expensive -- infusions can cost $ 100 # 000 a year or more , depending_on the patient . But it is risk-free because no plasma -- and hence , no donor -- is required to make_it . So amid the disappearance of one generation of hemophiliacs , the outlook for the next has never been brighter . &quot; It ' s a very exciting time , actually , &quot; said Dr. Jonathon Goldsmith , who directs the Hemophilia Comprehensive Care Center at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . &quot; Something good has come_out of the tragedy. &quot; But the biggest excitement of all is gene therapy , which Goldsmith says could be available within the next decade . If experiments -- some of which are being conducted by Baxter Hyland -- bear fruit , there would be no more need for Factor 8 and Factor 9 . After a decade of death , there would be a cure . Hemophilia and AIDS AIDS has taken a devastating toll on people with hemophilia ; half of the estimated 20 # 000 hemophiliacs in the United States are infected with the human_immunodeficiency_virus as a result of tainted blood products . By 1984 , AIDS had been diagnosed in 103 people with hemophilia , and 98 of them had died . The following chart shows how many new AIDS cases were reported each year , and how many of those patients have since died .
