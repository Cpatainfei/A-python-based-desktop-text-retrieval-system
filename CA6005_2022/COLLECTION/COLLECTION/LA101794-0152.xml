   <HEADLINE> UNICEF KNOCKS_ON NEW DOORS FOR SUPPORT ; CHARITY : WHAT BEGAN AS A HALLOWEEN TRADITION TO HELP CHILDREN IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TACKLES SAME PROBLEMS AT_HOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People remember the little orange boxes . Since the 1950s , American children have carried them door-to-door on Halloween night , collecting donations for UNICEF instead of candy . The box was a bridge , linking children of the world ' s most wealthy nation , with needy children in foreign countries . But these days , the line that separates them from us has blurred , forcing UNICEF ' s American supporters -- particularly those in Los Angeles -- to sharpen their approach to fund-raising and advocacy , aiming their efforts for those at_home as well as abroad . &quot; We can ' t just talk_about children ' over there ' because those children live here now , &quot; said Marilyn F . Solomon , executive_director of the Los Angeles chapter of the U.S. Committee for United Nations International Children ' s Emergency Fund in Los Angeles . &quot; We have the same problems. &quot; Since becoming executive_director in January , Solomon has dedicated much of her time to refining the city ' s understanding of the 47-year-old organization . In communities throughout the city , Solomon is spreading the message : UNICEF is alive and well and concerned with issues facing children in East L.A. as well as those in Rwanda . &quot; The difference now is that we ' re getting_on the street and meeting face-to-face with community people , &quot; said Solomon , a longtime community organizer who began her work in the northeast San Fernando Valley . &quot; I think that ' s very different. &quot; Of late , the Los Angeles chapter has been busy forming partnerships with community-based organizations , part of an effort to increase public awareness of UNICEF and to forge the gap between local and international efforts for youth , Solomon said . This month , the Los Angeles committee is co-sponsoring the Third Annual Pan-African Film Festival , a two-week event that will raise funds for UNICEF ' s Africa project and two local , predominantly African American private_schools . &quot; There ' s such a relationship between the status of children in our own back yard and children in other places , &quot; Solomon said . &quot; With these partnerships we feel we can make a difference globally and locally. &quot; The local organization ' s new slant coincides with a national movement aimed at broadening the focus of the organization to include children in the U.S. Armed with the now-famous orange boxes , American children over the years have collected more_than $ 100 million for UNICEF on Oct . 31 , National UNICEF Day . The money collected on Halloweens past has been used to buy medicine , supply freshwater and provide primary education to children around the world . But this year , for the first time in its history , the organization has declared the entire month of October as National UNICEF Month . Not only will American children collect money for others , now they will have an opportunity to learn about the people who benefit from their efforts . The organization ' s goal is to have trained volunteers and staff_members visit schools nationwide during October , sharing their knowledge of other cultures and places with American schoolchildren in hopes of fostering a respect for differences . &quot; They need help understanding global diversity , which is not across the ocean anymore , &quot; said Gwendolyn Calvert Baker , president and chief_executive_officer of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF , based in New York . &quot; So_much of it is in the classrooms sitting right next to them and on the playground. &quot; Around the world , conflicts based on cultural , ethnic , religious and political differences cause the death of countless children every year . &quot; There has to be a way to break that cycle in how we work with_children and help them to grow beyond that , &quot; Solomon said . In multicultural Los Angeles , building that kind of understanding among schoolchildren , and forming alliances with churches , community groups , businesses and schools is critical -- and difficult . Back-to-back disasters in recent years have stretched &quot; our giving capacity , &quot; Solomon said . A recent report ranked Los Angeles 48th out of 50 large U.S. cities for charitable giving per capita . Add_to that , the city ' s changing demographics -- which translates into a change in giving patterns and habits -- and the task of creating an interest in international giving and advocacy is even more daunting . &quot; One of the challenges . . . is to understand that situation , &quot; Solomon said . &quot; To look_at a country like Rwanda and try to find a link between what ' s necessary to revitalize our own community and also excite this community to reach beyond itself. &quot; So Solomon spent a recent weekend visiting churches in the African American community and throughout the city , encouraging ministers to invite their congregations to the two-week film festival . And there will be other events this month to introduce the community to UNICEF and to raise funds : a concert featuring singer Maxine Weldon at Lunaria Restaurant and Jazz Club , a reception at the Alitash Kebede Art_Gallery featuring the work of artist Herbert Gentry . &quot; We want people to know we ' re here and the kinds of projects we ' re involved in , &quot; Solomon said . In addition to the UNICEF donors &quot; who have always been with us , &quot; her multicultural outreach aims to create a new tradition of giving and involvement in other communities as well . In July , the organization hosted an evening in Los Angeles with Julio Iglesias , a national UNICEF spokesman , and invited members of the Latino community &quot; to get acquainted with Mr. Iglesias and the work of the U.S. committee , &quot; Solomon said . Ayuko Babu sees a parallel between the goals of the Pan-African Film Festival and those of UNICEF . &quot; Our mission is to bring an awareness and consciousness about black people around the world , &quot; said Babu , executive_director of the festival . Awareness leads to understanding and concern -- which then leads to action -- but all too often Americans possess only vague sketches of people in other places , Babu said . Sketchier still is Americans ' understanding of the relationship between their lives and the lives of people abroad , how the hot cocoa Americans drink to feel cozy on cold winter days comes from Ghana , for example . &quot; And the people who pick ( it ) are poor and don ' t have enough money &quot; to enjoy it themselves , he said . The film festival &quot; fits right in with &quot; UNICEF ' s and Solomon ' s goal of &quot; letting folks have a better sense of what ' s happening , &quot; he said . At The Extraordinary Place , one of the schools that will receive funds from the festival , educators say UNICEF ' s involvement in local issues will &quot; contribute to the effort to keep children ( in America ) on the forefront of people ' s minds &quot; -- a contribution as valuable as the money . &quot; It just makes me feel very hopeful because so_much of the attention tends to be_on the children abroad who are without , &quot; said Ernestine Washington , who is program coordinator of the Crenshaw-area , nonprofit educational cooperative . &quot; I was very impressed by UNICEF ' s outreach to the community . My prayer would be that it continues. &quot; Whether meeting with heads of corporations spreading the message of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF or with members of the Latino community , Solomon can fall_back on the relationships fostered during her nearly 30 years of organizing and community building in Los Angeles . Beginning in the 1960s , she worked with the Latin_American Civic Assn . and started a Head_Start Program in the basement of a Pacoima church . While raising six children in the Valley , she taught preschool , worked with the Fair Housing Council , and numerous other organizations . And she currently sits on the board of directors of RLA , the Los Angeles Art Festival and others . &quot; She ' s been a real leader in the black community and the larger Los Angeles community , &quot; said Babu , who has known Solomon for many years . For nearly 30 years she worked_at KCOP-Channel 13 , where she was director of corporate relations and executive producer of information programs . Over the years she won five Emmy Awards and numerous others for documentaries and children ' s programs , including &quot; Whatever Happened to Childhood ? &quot; , a look_at the changing lifestyles of American children . Like the organizers of the film festival , Solomon knows the power of images . Some of the festival films focus_on the lives of children in countries where UNICEF has been a benefactor . &quot; Man By the Shore &quot; by Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck , is the story of a Haitian child whose life and struggles &quot; become a metaphor for a_people , &quot; Babu said . &quot; These Hands , &quot; by Flora M ' mbugu-Schelling tells of the conditions facing women in Tanzania , who , with babies at their sides , make a living crushing rocks used to build beachside tourist hotels . The films help people draw a connection between real_life , Babu said , &quot; and that time you dropped your quarter in that little box for Halloween. &quot;</TEXT>
