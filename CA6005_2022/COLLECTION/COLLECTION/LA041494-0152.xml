   <HEADLINE> VATICAN OKS USE OF GIRLS AS ALTAR SERVERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a break_with tradition , the Vatican has officially approved girls serving at the altar during Roman_Catholic Masses but stressed Wednesday that the decree is unrelated to the church ' s opposition to women priests . The church ' s decision was not unexpected . Bishops in the United States have long voiced support for girls serving at the altar . Indeed , many U.S. Catholic parishes have had altar girls for years , but their status has been clouded and a cause for disagreement among the faithful . The Vatican agreed to consider the issue a year ago . By unambiguously granting girls the same privileges as boys to assist priests at Mass -- the central act of Catholic worship -- the Vatican has all but ended the controversy . Altar servers , generally ages 8 to 14 , assist the priest by lighting altar candles , participate in the ritual washing of the priest ' s hands , and present the bread and wine to the priest to be consecrated as the body and blood of Jesus_Christ . Archbishop William H . Keeler of Baltimore , president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , called the decision a welcome one . &quot; I think everyone will accept it . They ' ll have to accept it , &quot; said Father Charles Miller , who teaches homiletics and liturgy at St . John ' s Seminary in Camarillo . &quot; No one wants to say little_girls are inferior or little_girls don ' t deserve it. &quot; But there was dissent . Women for Faith &amp; Family , a conservative Catholic lay group based in St . Louis , called the decision a &quot; pastoral error &quot; that would cause further confusion and unduly raise hopes that women would eventually be ordained as priests . An unknown number of Catholic parishes in the United States have had both altar_boys and altar girls since the mid-1980s , including some in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles . These parishes relied_on a change in canon_law in 1983 , which , unlike previous church codes , no longer specifically forbade altar girls . Among them is St . Elizabeth Catholic_Church in Altadena . Father Richard Prindle , the parish ' s pastor , said Wednesday that the Vatican announcement may come as a surprise to his altar servers . &quot; I think they ' re probably completely unaware there was ever an issue , &quot; Prindle said . Other parishes , however , have awaited an explicit authorization from the Vatican before allowing girls to serve . &quot; There was a feeling that maybe some had jumped the gun , &quot; said Father Gregory Coiro , a spokesman for the Los Angeles archdiocese . Now that the issue has been clarified , Coiro and Miller said , tensions should ease . They said much of the opposition was not related to girls serving at the altar as such , but to allowing the practice before the Vatican had clarified its position . &quot; In the minds of some people , it was sort of a litmus test of how loyal you were to the Holy_See whether you allowed female altar servers or not , &quot; Coiro said . The approval , announced Wednesday by papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro , came_in a letter by the Vatican ' s Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments that was approved by Pope John Paul II . In 1992 , the Congregation for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts had said there was nothing in canon_law to forbid altar girls . Permission for the use of altar girls does not represent a major innovation , Navarro said , but rather an interpretation that church statutes concerning lay altar servers are equally applicable to both sexes . Despite the authorization , local bishops have the last word on whether to authorize altar girls in their dioceses . In Washington , Msgr . Frank Maniscalco , spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , said that before local bishops implement the changes involving altar girls they would confer among themselves at their national conference in November . The Los Angeles archdiocese , the nation ' s most populous , will introduce guidelines next week , Coiro said . The guidelines , among other things , ask parish priests to fully explain the changes to parishioners . Members of the laity , including women , have long served as lectors , reading the appointed Scriptures during Mass and assisting the priest in dispensing the Sacraments to parishioners . Vatican sources were quick to insist that there was no prospect of any change in the Vatican prohibition against women priests . The Pope has been unbending in his opposition to women priests . Unlike the issue of altar girls , the ordination of women goes_to the heart of Catholic theology , which holds that because Jesus was a male and chose only men as his disciples , the church has no right to admit women to the priesthood . &quot; This decision has nothing to do with ordained ministry , which has a different juridical and doctrinal nature , &quot; Navarro said . &quot; It would be wrong to interpret this as the first_step toward woman priests. &quot; Stammer reported from Los Angeles and Montalbano from Rome .</TEXT>
