   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA SEEKS WIDER ACCORD WITH NATO ; MILITARY : MOSCOW ' S DEFENSE MINISTER PRESENTS THE PROPOSAL IN BRUSSELS . IT WOULD GO BEYOND THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia on Wednesday proposed beginning broad talks with NATO on a wide range of issues , from nuclear proliferation to the environment -- beyond its latest decision to join the Partnership for Peace program . The plan , unveiled at a NATO-sponsored meeting by Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev , appeared to be aimed partly at domestic consumption , to show hard-liners at_home that Russia is still holding its own in dealing with the West . Grachev did not make his proposal a condition for Russia ' s joining the Partnership for Peace program , which was set_up by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization five months ago to provide an opportunity for closer links with former East Bloc countries . The Russians , who submitted their preliminary application for the program Tuesday , are expected to join formally as early as June , at a meeting of NATO foreign_ministers scheduled to be held_in Istanbul , Turkey . Even so , the Western response to Grachev was lukewarm at best . Although the NATO defense ministers seemed relieved that Russia had not set conditions for its entry into the program , they seemed cool to the notion of broader talks . U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , asked about the plan at a news_conference later , said only that what Grachev is proposing is &quot; set_up along different parameters &quot; than the Partnership for Peace program . He declined to comment on the substance of the request . Western officials said they still are not sure how NATO would respond to the proposal . Besides proliferation and the environment , Grachev listed defense conversion and disarmament as possible topics in any broader talks . Wednesday ' s session marked the first time that the NATO defense ministers and their counterparts from countries in the Partnership for Peace program have met as a group . So far , 18 governments , representing East European and ex-Soviet countries , have signed_up . Perry , noting that for most of its existence the alliance had been devoted to defending the West against the now-defunct Warsaw Pact , called a NATO session held Tuesday &quot; a major step_in removing the dividing line between East and West. &quot; Although Russia submitted its initial &quot; protocol &quot; Tuesday , Western defense ministers seemed encouraged that Grachev himself attended the entire meeting here . The group later went_to Mons , Belgium , to tour a new Partnership for Peace center there . Until this week , Western officials had feared that Russia might seek some sort of special status as a condition for joining the program -- leading to worries among some East Europeans that it was trying to dominate the group . But Grachev made_it clear Wednesday that Moscow would not press such demands as a condition for membership in the program . &quot; We are not setting any preconditions for joining , &quot; he told reporters . He also announced that as part of its new role in the Partnership for Peace program , Russia would be willing to join NATO forces in a wide variety of operations , from peacekeeping duties to joint military exercises . In that connection , the United States and Russia announced Tuesday that they will go_ahead with previous plans to hold joint military exercises this summer , despite indications earlier that they might be canceled . In outlining his proposal for broader consultations between Russia and NATO , Grachev argued that existing talks are proving inadequate for the job , and that Russia and the West need a new vehicle for widening their current agenda . While praising the Partnership for Peace program as a &quot; first_step &quot; in bringing the two sides closer , he said it is &quot; not the complete answer to the reality of the new epoch. &quot; &quot; Russia is prepared_for the creation of a real and full strategic partnership with NATO , &quot; Grachev declared . He called his plan &quot; a practical step_on the road to the formation of a system of collective security. &quot; Although Grachev ' s proposal for broader talks was not likely to upset existing Western diplomatic machinery , analysts said it has the potential to turn NATO into a political forum well beyond its historic role as a military alliance .</TEXT>
