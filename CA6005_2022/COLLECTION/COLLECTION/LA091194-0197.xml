   <HEADLINE> MAST HYSTERIA ; TALL SHIPS ' ARRIVAL TURNS LANDLUBBERS INTO OLD_SALTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cannons popping and sails billowing , a slice of 19th-Century nautical history cruised into Dana Point Harbor Saturday in a coastal celebration of the sea . This annual festival of tall ships led by Orange County ' s brig Pilgrim seemed a tailor-made event for kids such_as 3-year-old &quot; Pirate &quot; Perry Waldman and 41-year-old Bob &quot; Silverbeard &quot; Chandler . For Waldman , a fan of Captain Hook and the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas , the harbor scene on the grounds of the Orange County Marine Institute proved an exciting venue to unsheathe his plastic sword , rub shoulders with &quot; real &quot; pirates and pal around with a young girlfriend he called &quot; Shark Bait. &quot; &quot; As soon as I knew this was going_on here , I knew I had to bring Perry , &quot; said the youngster ' s dad , Robert Waldman . &quot; He loves the tall ships . As young as he is , I really think he enjoys the romance of all this. &quot; How else could anyone explain the appearance of Chandler ? Dressed in period clothing , a long machete safely tucked_in his belt , &quot; Silverbeard &quot; walked the grounds carrying what he claimed was the skull of his mother-in-law . &quot; She don ' t eat much . She don ' t nag much . I ' d say she ' s damn near perfect , &quot; he said , thrusting the gray plastic figure closer to one tourist . Never straying from character , the Riverside resident said he ' s been a pirate &quot; all me life. &quot; &quot; Aye , it ' s the fantasy of it , &quot; he said . &quot; It is another time , another place . For me it ' s an escape. &quot; The colorful nautical theme touched nearly every display at the festival . From fish T-shirts , paintings and scrimshaw , the celebration even featured a miniature dolphin merry-go-round . * But the real stars of the day were the graceful vessels bearing the names Hawaiian Chieftain , Swift of Ipswich , Pilgrim of Newport , Kelpie , Spike of Africa , Red Witch , Curlew and Witch of Wood . Launched in April , 1979 , the Witch of Wood is the creation of Capt . Stan Pietrucki , whose fascination with tall ships began when , as a child , he built boats &quot; to float through mud puddles. &quot; &quot; I guess I just kept building them bigger and bigger , &quot; said Pietrucki , standing before his biggest &quot; model &quot; yet . &quot; It ' s madness , I guess. &quot; All of 61 feet and 35 tons , the Witch of Wood took Pietrucki 17 years to build and it has since become a permanent home for him and his wife . From the dock , the fine-lined schooner looks_like a relic from a bygone time , but below deck the Pietruckis enjoy most of the modern conveniences . There are tiled sinks and a high-tech radio system in the cabin , a microwave in the galley and a step-down shower in the head . &quot; I don ' t think you ' ll see that in many of these ships , &quot; Pietrucki said , pointing his land-loving guest toward the bathroom . Of the armada assembled Saturday in Dana Point Harbor , the Witch of Wood might be the smallest . But Pietrucki -- his salt-and-pepper hair pulled into a short ponytail -- said his eight cannons &quot; pack a pretty big bite. &quot; &quot; We operate this as a pirate vessel , &quot; he said , preparing_for launch . &quot; It ' s a totally different lifestyle . I don ' t have a garage to store a bunch of stuff . But it ' s the freedom we enjoy. &quot; Said Chris Fox of Dana Point , a crew_member on the Witch : &quot; This is a throwback to a great age . It is a lifestyle that doesn ' t conform_to the normal rules of life . A sailor ' s life is confined to the ship , but the wide-open expanses of the ocean is your world. &quot; By noon Saturday , the coastal hillsides in South County were dotted with people who had gathered to watch the graceful procession of vessels set_out to join another group at Aliso Pier . * When the fleet made the turn_back to Dana Point , dozens of pleasure_boats joined the parade back to the harbor , some sounding their horns . While the ships were at_sea and briefly out_of_sight , artist Gregory Lincoln was displaying his works , a number of which included paintings of the same tall ships about to return to port . &quot; The ships are really the attraction here , &quot; Lincoln said , dressed in a long-sleeved mariner ' s shirt and cap . &quot; People can ' t see this everyday . It ' s part of the history and romance of the so-called good ol ' days. &quot;</TEXT>
