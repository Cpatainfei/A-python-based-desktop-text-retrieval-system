   <HEADLINE> BLOCKBUSTER BUYS STAKE IN VIRGIN INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT ; TRANSACTION : IRVINE-BASED VIDEO_GAME PUBLISHER WILL USE EXPECTED $ 30 MILLION FROM THE DEAL PLUS INFUSION BY HASBRO TO DEVELOP NEW IDEAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under a deal announced Monday , Orange County ' s largest video_game publisher could become a major national player in the development of the next generation of interactive video_games . Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. , the nation ' s largest chain of video stores , said it has bought a 19.9 % stake in Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Irvine , a transaction valued at $ 30 million . Video_game publishers are hot properties now because they are expected to produce the content , or &quot; killer applications , &quot; that will create demand for much-heralded services such_as 500-channel interactive TV . Last year , toy-maker giant Hasbro Inc. bought a 16.2 % stake in Virgin Interactive ( formerly known as Virgin Games ) for $ 25 million . Virgin Interactive will use the money from both deals to develop new games , which are becoming complicated and costly as programmers incorporate video , animation , compact_disc sound and stories in so-called multimedia games . Virgin Interactive has a foothold in the emerging multimedia personal_computer market , and the market for Nintendo and Sega video_games . The price paid by Blockbuster suggests that Virgin Interactive is worth $ 151 million . As for Blockbuster , the company &quot; wants to expand into as_many areas of entertainment as possible , &quot; said Wally Knief , spokesman for Blockbuster at its Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , headquarters . &quot; We want to have some content to put_on the information superhighway. &quot; Analysts say that as technology advances , Blockbuster could find its video rental business radically changed if , as promised , cable TV operators offer video on demand -- an application in which someone at_home can use a remote_control to choose a movie or play a video_game from a TV menu . Blockbuster also has stakes in two film companies that together own more_than 20 # 000 hours of movies , some of which could be used in games . Virgin Interactive ' s 90 titles include &quot; The 7th Guest , &quot; a haunted mansion mystery that is the hottest-selling game in the computer compact_disc market , and &quot; Monopoly Deluxe , &quot; &quot; RoboCop vs . Terminator &quot; and &quot; Cool Spot. &quot; Many of the titles are offered for rental in Blockbuster ' s 3 # 593 video outlets nationwide . Most of the company ' s stock is owned by Virgin Group in London , which operates an airline and the_Virgin Megastore retail_chain of music stores . Blockbuster , in turn , is a part owner of Virgin ' s 20-store music and video super-store chain . A Blockbuster executive prematurely announced the_Virgin Interactive-Blockbuster deal at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week . But Virgin Interactive President Martin Alper said at the time that the agreement was not yet final and that Blockbuster ' s board was preoccupied with its pending offer to merge with Viacom Inc. , the producer of MTV and Nickelodeon . An industry source said Monday that Virgin Interactive , which employs more_than 250 people in Orange County , is expected to sell some of its remaining shares to the public in the near future . A majority of the company ' s stock is held by Richard Branson , owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways and founder of Virgin Interactive , and his family trust . Those shares would be sold if there were a public offering , the source said .</TEXT>
