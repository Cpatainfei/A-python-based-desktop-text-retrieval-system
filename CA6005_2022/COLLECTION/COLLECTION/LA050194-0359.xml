   <HEADLINE> ANAHEIM AND THE RAMS : FINAL PLAY ? ; OTHER CITIES PANT TO WIN TEAM OVER ; MOVE : FOOTBALL-HUNGRY BALTIMORE , ST . LOUIS , MEMPHIS , SAN ANTONIO AND HARTFORD ARE THE HOTTEST CONTENDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tired of shelling_out big bucks for that inferior product the Rams have fielded lately ? Frustrated by four consecutive losing seasons and a string of questionable front-office moves ? The folks in Baltimore , St . Louis , Memphis , San Antonio and Hartford would love the company of your misery . Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . . . your Los Angeles Rams . They ' ll take the wretched refuse of our teeming shore . These football-hungry cities are making their pitches , and to Rams owner Georgia Frontiere and Executive_Vice_President John Shaw , they ' re like belt-high fastballs down the middle of the plate -- very enticing . Each of the cities is offering a more financially lucrative deal than the Rams have in Anaheim . But there ' s also some fine print , such_as potential legal hassles that could follow a move to Baltimore ; the possibility of a messy stadium lease in St . Louis , and the reluctance of the other NFL owners to approve a third franchise in Texas or a fourth in the New England-New York area . The Rams , of course , could stay in Anaheim . They could sell_out every game in 1994 , lease out every luxury suite for 10 years , negotiate a better stadium lease , win the next four Super Bowls , make gobs of money and live happily ever after in Orange County . But if they do decide to leave , their most likely destination is Baltimore , St . Louis or Memphis , Tenn. , with San Antonio , Hartford , Conn . -- and , yes , Los Angeles -- considered long_shots . The Rams played in the antiquated Coliseum for more_than 30 years before moving to Anaheim , and there have been rumblings of Los Angeles putting_together a new stadium deal to lure them back . But don ' t expect an offer from the government sector . &quot; They ' re welcome to come_back , but I don ' t think you can spend your resources on a type of facility that , while it ' s not state-of-the-art , we already have , &quot; said John Ferraro , a Los Angeles city councilman . &quot; To spend that kind of money when we have so many other problems . . . we could be condemned for even thinking_of something like that. &quot; But there are several other cities , desperate for pro football , that have raised taxes or floated municipal_bonds to fund stadium projects . An update of activity in five potential future homes of the Rams : BALTIMORE Peter G . Angelos , majority owner of baseball ' s Baltimore_Orioles , is now heading efforts to bring NFL football back to the city , taking_over for the Baltimore Stadium Authority after it failed to win an expansion team in 1993 . Angelos has reportedly bid $ 200 million to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , and he recently acknowledged that Larry Lucchino , former president of the Orioles and a member of Angelos ' NFL investment group , has met with Rams officials . Speculation that Frontiere might sell a minority interest in the Rams to Angelos was fueled during league meetings in March , when owners discussed a resolution that would allow them to own more_than one major_league team in the same city . The sponsors of that resolution ? The Rams . Shaw , however , said he made that proposal in 1993 and that it had nothing to do with Angelos . Owners aren ' t expected to vote on it for at least a year . Maryland Gov . William Donald Schaefer , meanwhile , has been under pressure from state General_Assembly leaders , who threatened in February to allocate the $ 160 million earmarked for a new stadium in Camden Yards to other state agencies unless he could secure a franchise . Legislators in Maryland ' s Washington , D.C. , suburbs were also concerned that Schaefer ' s staunch refusal to endorse Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke ' s plans to build a new 78 # 000-seat stadium in Laurel , Md. , just south of Baltimore , would drive_away the Redskins , leaving Maryland with , possibly , no NFL team . But in March , Schaefer struck a stadium compromise with lawmakers , welcoming a Redskins ' move to Laurel in exchange for assurances that Baltimore ' s stadium financing would remain in place . Cooke , however , did not promise to support a Baltimore team . It will be at least a year before Cooke receives the zoning approvals necessary to break ground in Laurel . The thinking in Maryland is that if Cooke begins construction , Baltimore ' s chances for an NFL team are slim . But if a team announces it ' s moving to Baltimore first , Cooke might have to stay in Washington or look elsewhere . Many government and business_leaders , including Angelos , believe Maryland can support two NFL teams . But Cooke does not and predicted the league would not allow two franchises so close . At the least , the team that lays_claim to Maryland first will likely avoid the legal battles that a second team would face if the NFL opposes a two-team Maryland . Cooke ' s stance also angered Maryland state Sen . John Pica ( D-Baltimore ) , who predicted that groundbreaking for the Laurel stadium would be delayed by lawsuits and zoning requirements long enough for a team to move to Baltimore . &quot; Years will pass before one shovel will break ground for that stadium , &quot; Pica told the Baltimore Sun . &quot; If Baltimore gets a team , we ' ll be playing football before they break ground , so Jack Kent Cooke has to decide whether he wants to build 14 miles away. &quot; ST . LOUIS In this corner , weighing in with 65 % of the new stadium ' s lease , is James Orthwein , former New England Patriots owner . And in this corner , with 30 % of the lease , is Jerry Clinton , St . Louis beer distributor and aspiring NFL owner . In the neutral corner is St . Louis County Executive George ( Buzz ) Westfall , who just wants to settle the darn mess and get_on_with the business of attracting an NFL team for the $ 258-million , 70 # 000-seat domed_stadium under construction . The problem : Orthwein would give_up his share of the lease for $ 1 but wants indemnification from future lawsuits . Clinton would give_up his share but wants $ 8 million , in return for expenses from the failed expansion bid . And Fran Murray , a Philadelphia entrepreneur who was part of the original expansion ownership group with Clinton , wants $ 1.9 million in expenses and has hinted at a possible lawsuit against Orthwein if he is not compensated . &quot; The whole_thing is a mess , &quot; said Mac Scott , Westfall ' s director of communications . &quot; Every time we go_around the corner , there ' s another set of problems. &quot; Compounding matters is the fact that Orthwein and Clinton are not exactly the best of friends . Westfall tried to settle the dispute in early April when he came_up with a plan calling_for Orthwein to transfer his share of the lease to Clinton , who would then convey the lease to FANS Inc. ( Football At the New Stadium ) , a nonprofit entity consisting_of Westfall and St . Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr . Clinton was offered $ 3.5 million in the deal but has not accepted . Westfall has a contingency plan . The new stadium lease dissolves in 1997 , so if the issue is not resolved soon , he ' ll try to entice an NFL team to play in 52 # 000-seat Busch Stadium until 1997 , with the city paying the team to make_up for lost revenue because of the reduced number of seats at Busch Stadium . &quot; We have a 52 # 000-seat stadium that was fine for football for 20 years , it may have to be fine for another three years , &quot; Scott said . &quot; The problem is , what team is going_to leave where they are now for a 52 # 000-seat stadium ? &quot; MEMPHIS Pepper Rodgers , the former coach who played a major role in the city ' s 1993 expansion effort , admits the chances of Memphis landing the Rams are slim . &quot; But I still think Ed McMahon is going_to give me $ 10 million , &quot; he said . &quot; I never give up. &quot; Neither is Steve Ehrhardt , an attorney and the president of Memphis Football Partners , who said he has had discussions with the Rams but would not elaborate . &quot; Our efforts are very strong , and they are being done_in a quiet way , &quot; he said . Ehrhardt was happy to rattle_off all_the reasons Memphis should be_on top of NFL teams ' relocation list , though . The Liberty Bowl lease is competitive with others being offered , and a Memphis team would be the only pro sports franchise in a five-state area . &quot; When someone does the investigation and sees the kinds of dollars they can make here , a team will be relocating within 18 months , &quot; Ehrhardt said . &quot; When you have football , hockey , basketball or baseball_teams in the same market , history shows that at one time or another , one of those teams is suffering . Here , you ' d be No . 1 and dominate the market , period. &quot; SAN ANTONIO B.J. ( Red ) McCombs , who owns 40 automobile franchises in south Texas and co-founded a $ 600-million broadcast company , is sure he can persuade the Rams to take a serious look_at San Antonio . If he could only get past their secretaries . McCombs , former owner of the National Basketball Assn. ' s San Antonio Spurs , said he hasn ' t been able to reach Shaw or Frontiere , but he hopes he and city officials will have more success now that the Rams are officially free_agents . With 1.3 million people , San Antonio has the nation ' s 43rd-largest radio-television market , but McCombs said that when you add fast-growing Austin and its 700 # 000 people to the mix , it would move_into the top 20 . And the 65 # 000-seat Alamodome has already been paid_for , thanks to a half-cent sales tax that expired last year . &quot; We are going_to get an NFL team here , because if anyone took a serious look_at us , they ' d come running , &quot; McCombs said . HARTFORD Marc Ganis , a national sports consultant with an office in Connecticut , has reportedly had conversations with the Rams and Raiders about relocation . Neither Ganis nor Avice Meehan , Gov . Lowell P . Weicker Jr. ' s press secretary , would comment or elaborate on those reports , but Ganis said he expects discussions to pick_up this month . &quot; Just because you don ' t hear about negotiations doesn ' t mean they ' re not taking_place , &quot; Ganis said . If not for Robert Kraft ' s 11th-hour deal to buy the Patriots and keep them in Foxboro , Mass. , Hartford might have snagged the Patriots in January with its offer of a $ 252-million stadium . &quot; If it ' s not the best , it ' s one of the best proposals out there , &quot; Ganis said . &quot; The market is very strong. &quot; What the Rams Have to Consider What do other cities have to offer the Rams that Anaheim doesn ' t ? Baltimore ' s deal might be the most lucrative , but all are attractive . City : ANAHEIM Stadium : A 69 # 008-seat facility with 113 luxury boxes . Renovated and expanded from approximately 43 # 000 seats before the Rams ' arrival from the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1980 . The Deal : Rams pay rent of 60 cents per admission , not to exceed $ 400 # 000 per year . Rams also give city 7.5 % of ticket revenue , 20 % of luxury box revenue and about half of parking and concessions . The Good : Rams avoid litigation , which undoubtedly would accompany announcement of departure . Team maintains tradition dating_back to 1946 and undoubtedly gets new , sweetened deal from city . The Bad : Expensive new stadium might be only way to keep team . Shared tenancy with Angels , practice facility dispute and continuing lukewarm fan support complicate situation . City : BALTIMORE Stadium : A $ 160-million , 72 # 000-seat facility , with 108 sky boxes and 7 # 500 club seats , next to Oriole Park at Camden Yards and paid_for with bonds backed by lotteries and stadium revenue . The Deal : All revenues from tickets , sky boxes , club seats , parking and concessions go_to the team , which would pay rent of $ 1 per game . Team would get Colts ' renovated training facility . The Good : Projected team profits of $ 28 million by fourth year of operation . Strong fan interest demonstrated by Orioles ' 1993 attendance ( 3 # 644 , 965 ) , seventh-highest total in major_league history . The Bad : Interest in Colts waned in years before 1984 departure to Indianapolis . Redskins ' intention to build new stadium in nearby Laurel , Md. , could disrupt Baltimore ' s plans . City : ST . LOUIS Stadium : A $ 258-million , 70 # 000-seat domed_stadium , paid_for with state- and local government-backed bonds , will be completed in 1995 and will have 101 sky boxes and 6 # 550 club seats . The Deal : All concession , in-house advertising , sky box and club seat revenue to team . Team would pay $ 250 # 000 per year but $ 75 # 000 in game-day expenses would be paid_for . No training facility exists . The Good : St . Louis ( pop . 2.47 million ) is the largest city without an NFL team , and it has the largest television market ( 18th ) without a team . Would fit well in any NFL realignment . The Bad : Conflicting ownership groups doomed 1993 expansion bid . Stadium lease problems could hinder relocation efforts . Has stigma of losing Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988 . City : MEMPHIS Stadium : The Liberty Bowl would undergo $ 60-million renovation , increasing capacity to 68 # 000 -- 102 sky boxes , 8 # 300 club seats . Financed by tax_breaks , state and local assistance . The Deal : All revenue from sky boxes , concession and parking go_to the team , which would pay $ 1 per seat per game in rent . City would fund construction of training facility / office complex . The Good : All sky boxes , club seats were leased for five to seven years during expansion try . Would be only pro franchise in five-state area of Tennessee , Mississippi , Alabama , Arkansas and Kentucky . The Bad : Even with renovations , stadium is antiquated compared to today ' s state-of-the-art facilities . Per-capita income of $ 13 # 590 was poorest of recent expansion candidates . City : SAN ANTONIO Stadium : The 65 # 000-seat Alamodome , which is expandable to 72 # 000 seats , includes 64 sky boxes and was completed last year . NBA ' s Spurs are current occupants of the facility . The Deal : Team would pay no rent and receive parking revenue , a percentage of concessions revenue to be negotiated with the city , and revenue from half the sky boxes ( Spurs control other half ) . The Good : A Dallas Cowboys-Houston Oilers exhibition_game in 1993 attracted a capacity crowd in football-mad state , and the Spurs are among the NBA ' s leaders in home attendance . The Bad : City ' s bid for NFL expansion team in 1993 was one of the first eliminated . Team would be secondary tenant in stadium . NFL probably would n ' t want third team in Texas . City : HARTFORD Stadium : State Legislature has authorized $ 252 million in_general obligation bonds for construction of 70 # 000-seat , 140-sky box stadium and adjoining practice facility . The Deal : Team would receive all revenue from concessions , parking , sky boxes , club seats and in-house advertising but would pay $ 4.9-million annual rent . The Good : Connecticut has the highest median household income of any state in the United States . Densely populated , with 9 million within a 75-mile radius of Hartford . The Bad : Nearby New York Jets , New York Giants and New England Patriots would likely oppose an NFL team moving to the state . Stadium rent is pretty steep .</TEXT>
