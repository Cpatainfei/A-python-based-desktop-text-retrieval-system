   <HEADLINE> STRIKE WHILE THE IRONING ' S STILL HOT ; FOR MOMS , WORKING CONDITIONS , SALARY AND PROSPECTS FOR ADVANCEMENT CAN BE DISMAL , DESPITE PROGRESS . DON ' T BE AFRAID TO PLAY HARDBALL WITH MANAGEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was the Homestead Strike of 1892 . Federal troops were sent_in and 18 people were killed . There was the Haymarket Riot of 1886 . Eleven men died in the protest against deplorable working conditions . Then there were My Mother ' s Strikes of 1954 , 1955 , 1956 and 1957 . Mom marched up_to her bedroom and stayed in bed for three days . We had to fend_for ourselves . &quot; I ' m on strike ! &quot; she ' d yell whenever we were hungry or needed our band uniforms . &quot; What are you striking for ? &quot; we ' d have asked if we ' d any idea what a strike was . &quot; A decent 12-hour working_day . The right to take a shower without worrying about the scum between the tiles. &quot; In the pre-feminist Dark Ages , such strikes were probably common . Friends of mine keep coming_up with childhood memories of Mom in the bedroom &quot; on strike. &quot; &quot; My mother would go upstairs and close her bedroom door and just refuse to come_out , &quot; a friend told me over coffee the other day . &quot; My dad would go_in there , and there ' d be yelling . It scared me . I ' d go_back and forth between them , trying to make peace. &quot; This friend and I brought our stories to a women ' s dinner and found compatriots : &quot; Me too ! My mother used to declare strikes after all_the holidays ! &quot; * These protests my friends and I witnessed weren ' t really strikes at all but small nervous_breakdowns . And why not ? Look_at our mothers ' working conditions . Their job performance was constantly under review by people with a grade-school education or less . They could be critiquing the Second Law of Thermodynamics and have to break_off to fetch a roll of toilet_paper . Their &quot; salaries &quot; evaporated whenever kids needed expensive new sports equipment or cool new outfits . They were plain overworked , slaving over meals and housework . Three days up in her bedroom ? What our mothers needed was a month in the country , a testimonial dinner and a trophy . And when the three days were up , it was back to the same old grind . It would be nearly two decades after our Mothers Strikes of the 1950s before women would make housework a political issue . In the General Strike of 1972 , women got plain about it : &quot; We hate housework ! &quot; &quot; Out of the kitchens and into the boardrooms ! &quot; Here we are 20 years later . Women are putting_in full workdays ( and not in the boardrooms ) , and studies show working mothers doing 90 % of the housework . But now they do_it at night and on weekends . My mother ' s strikes were futile in terms of winning a shorter , gentler workday . But some mothers went_on strike and made real gains against management . I remember when Aunt Pearl disappeared . After stranding Uncle Bob with the kids for three days ( a casual survey indicates three days as the standard duration of a mother ' s strike ) , she called from a hotel in Connecticut , where she read off a list of demands . They were met . Most women don ' t have Aunt Pearl ' s chutzpah . Self-effacing moms tend not to be hardball bargainers . As guardian of the household budget they identify too strongly with management : &quot; Three nights at a fancy hotel ? When Tracy needs Rollerblades and Matt ' s dying for a Sega CD_player ? &quot; Women need to practice preserving a stronghold of ego against the pull of domestic and custodial responsibility . My husband remembers his mother locking herself in the bathroom to study her textbooks when , in her forties , she decided to become a teacher . Her kids kept demanding band uniforms and snacks . She kept studying . They yelled louder . She kept studying . * She finally passed her exams , got her teaching_certificate and hired somebody else to iron the uniforms and make the snacks . Now that we ' ve admitted the General Strike of 1972 was a washout , it ' s time to get real . Individual mother ' s strikes are in again . So let ' s learn from the examples set two generations ago : 1 . When striking , always go_to a hotel . Beds are for sick people . 2 . Have a plan . Make a list of demands . Going_into a three-day snit doesn ' t get you anywhere . 3 . Don ' t fight with your husband . That just traumatizes the next generation of strikers . 4 . Forget perfectionism . Wrinkled band uniforms are a small price to pay_for a decent life . Above all , remember those who struck before you . Be strong ! Someday one of us will reach the mountaintop , look down the other side , and tell us how women juggle it all_in the Promised Land .</TEXT>
