   <HEADLINE> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART : MILLER ' S COMEBACK IS OVERSHADOWED BY TV EXPERTISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are two things wrong with this week ' s Nissan L.A. Open : ( 1 ) Johnny Miller is announcing rather than playing , and ( 2 ) there ' s no cable coverage of the first two rounds . Miller ' s candor makes him the best golf commentator on television , but after his improbable victory at Pebble Beach last weekend , it would be better if he were playing again this week . The victory gave Miller an automatic two-year qualifying exemption for all PGA tournaments , but he told NBC Monday that he had made a number of commitments this week , including one to announce the L.A. Open , and he planned to honor them . Miller had played competitively only five times in four years before Pebble Beach . He isn ' t playing in the L.A. Open , but he says he will play in the Masters . And how does he expect to do at Augusta ? &quot; Those greens will kick my butt , &quot; he said . You ' ve got_to like that candor . * Golf fans have come_to expect seeing the first two rounds_of_golf tournaments on either ESPN or the USA network . About half of the 36 televised PGA Tour events get early-round cable coverage -- including all_of the big ones . USA did nine last year , ESPN seven . The USA network televised the early rounds of the L.A. Open in 1993 , but passed this year because of the February sweeps rating period . Entertainment programming generally gets higher ratings than golf . A deal for ESPN to carry this year ' s early rounds fizzled when a sponsor package couldn ' t be put_together to defray production_costs , said John Evenson , the PGA ' s vice_president of broadcasting . The L.A. Open is_on NBC instead of CBS this year because of the Winter_Olympics . But CBS -- and USA -- will be back in the fold next year , Evenson said . * Miller and partner Jim Lampley will be joined by on-course reporters Roger Maltbie , Bob Trumpy and Dan Hicks for NBC ' s weekend coverage of the L.A. Open . Mike Ditka will also be_on hand to offer tips on golf etiquette . Now there ' s a twist . * Radio talk : It started_out as just another call to a sports-talk show . Nancy of Malibu was calling KMPC ' s Joe McDonnell to talk_about Rick Neuheisel , UCLA ' s receivers coach who got passed_over in favor of Bob Toledo for the offensive coordinator job . Nancy said she thought Neuheisel got a raw_deal , but then explained she might be a little biased because her last_name was also Neuheisel . Turns_out she was Rick ' s sister . &quot; Rick feels as if he has been kicked_in the stomach , &quot; Nancy said . &quot; He thought he would be at UCLA forever , and this is how he is treated . &quot; Today is Rick ' s birthday , and how is he spending it ? He ' s teaching the offense to Bob Toledo. &quot; Nancy Neuheisel , a cheerleader at Arizona when Rick was a quarterback at UCLA in the early 1980s , went_on to tear_into Coach Terry Donahue , speculating that he didn ' t promote her brother because he was afraid of him . McDonnell had earlier said it was a no-win situation for Donahue . If he promoted Neuheisel and the Bruins won , then Neuheisel would get the credit . If they lost , then fans would want Neuheisel to replace Donahue . Nancy Neuheisel agreed with McDonnell ' s theory . Did Rick know she was calling ? &quot; No , &quot; she said , &quot; and he might not be too happy about it , either. &quot; That would seem to be a safe bet .</TEXT>
