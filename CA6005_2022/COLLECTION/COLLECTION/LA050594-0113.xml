   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; GONZALEZ-TORRES EVOKES A POETRY OF INTERACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The gossamer poetry of Felix Gonzalez-Torres ' spare and evocative art is spoken through a symbolic interaction between artist and audience . At the Museum of Contemporary Art , where his gently lovely exhibition , &quot; Traveling , &quot; opened last week , the activity of looking_at art is cast as a ritual exchange . The show is small , just eight works made of simple materials -- mirrors , clocks , a string of lights , candies wrapped in bright gold_foil -- arrayed in simple configurations . Often they ' re set_out in pairs , as in two thick stacks of rectangular sheets_of_paper standing on the floor in proximity ; two mirrors embedded side-by-side in the wall ; or two ordinary commercial wall_clocks ticking in near-unison . The repeated pairing keys you to consider connections between things . Gonzalez-Torres ' art puts community on an artistic platform usually reserved for individuality alone . Publicness mingles with privacy , while the boundaries between them blur . The round wall_clocks , &quot; Untitled ( Perfect Lovers ) , &quot; are installed high on the wall and they abut . In design terms , abutted shapes are said to be kissing . The clocks , set at exactly the same time , steadily tick away , but their second_hands are not quite in perfect sync . * Were they ever ? Or is this couple inexorably going_further and further out of sync , as time goes_by ? Or are the two just different in the details within the larger commonality of telling the same time ? In &quot; Untitled ( Strange Bird ) , &quot; a wall-size black-and-white billboard image of a cloudy sky is interrupted by the sight of an oddly shaped bird . It ' s odd , that is , until you realize that the bird , seen in silhouette from a great distance , is actually two birds , not one , flying freely yet apparently close_together . In addition to the billboard in the museum , 20 more are scattered around Los Angeles , while the image also will be printed in six suburban newspapers , all as part of MOCA ' s show . The picture ' s appearance in emphatic public settings asks the question : Out in public , are these two birds together ? Gonzalez-Torres , who is openly gay , knows as well as anyone the ramifications of the question . Identity exists only in_relation_to the world outside itself , not as something autonomous or pure . So , distinctions between public and private are tricky . False ones lead to repressive institutions like the closet , which is a public concealment of gay identity , and which in turn fuels such failed schemes as the dumb U.S. military policy of &quot; Don ' t ask , don ' t tell. &quot; A pair is also the sparest means by which to suggest repetition , and repetition is the core of ritual . Gonzalez-Torres ' best work has the unmistakable heft of public ceremony with all_the sense of gravity and moral seriousness ceremony conveys , but without pomposity or posturing . * The most unpretentiously beautiful example is &quot; Untitled ( Placebo-Landscape-for Roni ) , &quot; which consists_of 1 # 200 pounds of brightly illuminated foil-wrapped candy . Like shimmering golden treasure strewn across the art museum floor from which a slight , sickly sweet aroma arises ( toffee ? ) , the dazzling eye-candy is there for the taking . A visitor is invited to take a single piece from the pile and consume the gift later , after leaving the museum , where its taste will recall the collective experience to mind . The pairs in Gonzalez-Torres ' art are compounded in &quot; Untitled ( Portrait of MOCA ) , &quot; made especially for the show . Like decorative trim on an entablature , two rows of words_forming a non-sequential time line are painted on encircling gallery walls at the juncture with the ceiling . Each event is paired with a date -- Great Society 1964 , Talkies 1927 , MTV 1991 , LA 1781 -- and interspersed with the names of exhibitions seen at MOCA since its founding . The only punctuation_marks in the frieze are quotations around the show titles -- &quot; Louis I . Kahn , &quot; &quot; High and Low , &quot; &quot; Helter Skelter &quot; -- which highlight them as institutional packages about history . These reverberate against the personalized packages of memory , which one has of the rest of the encircling list . Both bump_up against &quot; Traveling &quot; -- the show this work is in . Gonzalez-Torres provocatively explores the busy , crowded intersection between public and private , collective and personal . In part , his skill was honed by participation with Group Material , a changing 1980s collaborative of artists . Cuban-born in 1957 , the New York-based artist is also fully of his generation . His work is built_on public-private intersections derived from traditions of Pop , Minimal and Conceptual art . Its emphasis on ritual may owe something to the fact that , after 30 years , the Pop-Minimal-Conceptual watershed definitively shaped the landscape of contemporary art . It now forms our culture ' s ceremonial circle . As such , how does an artist showing in a museum keep_from being elevated to ceremonial high_priest , which would tip the scales by promoting the individual over the communal , the personal over the public ? MOCA , which organized the show in collaboration with the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington , where it also is being shown , seems to address the dilemma with the accompanying catalogue . But , the effort badly misfires . Beautifully designed , the 80-page book contains an introduction by the three curators , a short bibliography and six essays by six authors , some startlingly autobiographical , others focused_on specific aspects of Gonzalez-Torres ' art . One essay ( the most interesting ) is by an eminence grise of Conceptual art . There is no checklist of the show ( which changes at each venue ) , no biography of the artist and no overview of his artistic development . Given the art , the omissions and inclusions presumably mean to shift focus away from the artist as personality , while denying a singular reading of his art . The miscarried result , however , is to spotlight institutional clout . Leaving scant room for dissent , a tribunal of influential curators bolstered by a juggernaut of writers collectively anoints an artist . You ' re left feeling slightly dazed by an onslaught of officialdom , while still wanting some rather basic information about Gonzalez-Torres , his work and the context within which the eight examples in the galleries have grown . Perhaps one ironic measure of this gossamer art ' s significance is how well it fends off your countervailing urge , which is to flee the airless grip of its looming institutional frame_of_reference . * Museum of Contemporary Art , 250 S . Grand Ave. , ( 213 ) 626-6222 , through June 19 . Closed Mondays .</TEXT>
