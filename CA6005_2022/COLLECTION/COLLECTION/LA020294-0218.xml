   <TEXT> Dagger-wielding goatherds and vintners lugging 50-year-old hunting rifles stalk the Pirin Mountains , listening as they tend their flocks and truss denuded vines for the starting shot of a fifth ethnic bloodletting this century . The summons will not come from the military high_command in Sofia . The government has vowed neutrality in the conflict destroying this land ' s Yugoslav neighbors . This peaceful pose has drawn Western plaudits for Bulgaria as an island of stability in a tempestuous realm . Neither will it be the promise of victory and resolution of the century-old &quot; Macedonian question &quot; that would propel Bulgarians into the medieval savagery on their doorstep . Impoverished and politically drifting , Bulgaria could expect from the current conflict the same ignominious defeat it suffered after four previous wars for Slavic unity and territorial grandeur . But logic and strategy seldom wield much clout against nationalist passions in the Balkans . If war spreads to Macedonia , explains would-be warrior Hari Mavrodiev , Bulgarians will be honor-bound to answer &quot; the call of blood. &quot; &quot; We must go and defend our relatives if this war touches them , &quot; says the burly , mustachioed paramilitary commander outfitted in camouflage . &quot; If war spills to Macedonia , every man in this region will go there to fight. &quot; The call of blood is a venerated principle by which the poor and backward of the Balkans live . The need to stand_by ethnic brothers , no matter how doomed their fight , is the defining measure of nationalist dignity and a convincing explanation for why the region ' s violent history is compelled to repeat itself . While officials in the capital of Sofia assure Western leaders of their determination to stay out of the Balkan conflict , the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization -- a turn-of-the-century terrorist group -- has reinvented itself as a quasi-legal nationalist movement . It is arming and training volunteers for battle . Mavrodiev and fellow activists in the group pay lip_service to the official aim of staying neutral . But they readily concede all bets are off if any Balkan neighbor threatens the Slavs of Macedonia , whom Bulgarians claim as their kin . &quot; We would be among the first to protect Macedonia , because we are conscious of the fact that we would not just be protecting a new country but our own brothers , &quot; said Anatoly Velichkov , a revolutionary organization leader in the city of Blagoevgrad . The brash , 29-year-old artilleryman disclosed that the group is engaged in paramilitary training . He said Bulgaria ' s loose , poorly applied gun-control laws pose little obstacle to the movement ' s drive to secure arms . The group ' s women ' s councils are stockpiling food and clothing in the event Slav refugees from neighboring Macedonia begin to pour in , and to ensure rations are ready for men who go_off to fight . The battles would be triggered , as Velichkov and others see it , by a series of events that would destabilize the region . Under these predictions : * Serbs would spark the crisis by moving to ethnically cleanse Albanians in Kosovo , the southern Serbian province . * In turn , Albanians in Kosovo , trying to escape Serbian aggression or gather arms and supporters for their fight , would seek refuge in the predominantly Albanian western half of Macedonia , disrupting the ethnic balance there ; as a result , Serbian forces would be enticed into Macedonia to eradicate nests of Albanian resistance . * Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians then would rush to the defense of the Macedonians . Almost 1 # 000 U.N. peacekeeping troops , including 300 American GIs , are deployed along the Macedonian-Serbian border in an effort to stare_down such an escalation . But the foreign soldiers , like 27 # 000 comrades deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia , are hamstrung with so restrictive a mandate they could do little more_than watch , if the worst happens . Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia ' s claim to independence from the former Yugoslav federation roughly two years ago , hoping that according it statehood would protect the territory from Serbian or Greek adventurism , preserving it for eventual union with Bulgaria . But Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov insists that his 2 million citizens make_up their own nation ; Macedonians reject claims that their people and language are actually Bulgarian , and they are wary , at best , about Sofia ' s offers of assistance to them in the event of conflict with the Serbs . This striving for a separate identity stirs the ire of nationalists like the 17 # 000 members of the revolutionary organization and the larger mass of Bulgarian society whose unspoken aspirations for unity they represent . &quot; There is too_much tolerance for this principle of self-determination , &quot; insists Velichkov , who contends the Macedonian nation is an artificial creation of late Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito . Velichkov believes war is coming and Bulgarian patriots must prepare_for it . He says the outbreak is not imminent because Serbian nationalists are now pinned_down by the struggle for Bosnian territory . Still , fears of being drawn into the Balkan conflict undulate with the waves of butchery in Bosnia , where an undeterred Serbian land grab is fueling regionwide desires for territorial expansion and demanding resolution of what has been known since the end of Ottoman Turkish rule as the &quot; Macedonian question. &quot; The dilemma arises from the search for political and national identity for a territory inhabited by at least eight peoples . Macedonia has had a name since antiquity but has seldom been united and never affixed with formal boundaries . More a geographic distinction than a national entity , like the Great Plains or the Sahara , the land known as Macedonia reaches_into three countries today -- northern Greece , this southwestern corner of Bulgaria and the entire former Yugoslav republic now bearing the name . With the Balkans ' diverse peoples seeking national definition in the post-Communist era , the expanse of Macedonia provides fertile ground for overlapping territorial claims and clashing nationalist sentiments and for reviving painful memories of ethnic slaughters . The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia , which covers about one-third of the geographic_region , has angered Greece by adopting a name that Athens considers the property of Hellenic history . Athens insists on referring to the newly independent state by the name of its capital , Skopje , and Bulgarians call it Vardar Macedonia , alluding to its principal river . Here , in the Bulgarian portion of the territory known as Pirin Macedonia , extremists lay claim to the whole region , contending that the former Yugoslavs are primarily Bulgars and that Slavs were the majority in the Greek sector , known as Aegean Macedonia , before Athens expelled them after World_War_II . Mihail Ivanov , adviser to Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev on ethnic and religious issues , concedes the clashing views of history could undermine the government ' s determination to preserve peace . &quot; We have to consider the worst possible scenario . Bulgaria has taken_part in two world_wars and two Balkan wars this century . A third Balkan war would be devastating , &quot; he says , with resignation rather than alarm . In the event of fighting in Macedonia , &quot; the Bulgarian government would oppose any involvement , but things would be out of control. &quot; Some academics in the region have lately expressed the view that Macedonia has little chance of surviving as an independent state -- comments seen here as fanning the hopes of neighboring nationalists lusting_after its territory . Ivanov sees another risk in partitioning Bosnia , in that it would strengthen the arguments of those who contend Christians and Muslims cannot live together . &quot; This model of intolerance is being transplanted into the minds of Bulgarians , &quot; Ivanov says , warning that religious polarization is a potent danger . Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitar Ikonomov sees the potential for a spread of the Balkan conflict as &quot; very great &quot; and cautions that the government ' s power to control extremists is limited . &quot; We are trying to avoid being influenced by the demons of the past , &quot; Ikonomov says . But , as at the start of this century , Bulgaria is an often forgotten state , too economically troubled to forge Western alliances and too militarily weak to defend itself should the regional bloodshed worsen . &quot; Conflict has been raging around us for three years now and everyone has been living_in a state_of_war paranoia , &quot; Ikonomov says . &quot; This has created a kind of vacuum that has to be filled. &quot; The revolutionary organization and an even more ardently nationalist group , OMO-Ilinden , appear to be filling that vacuum . More_than 1.5 million of Bulgaria ' s 8.5 million people claim Macedonian origin -- 350 # 000 from the Pirin area and many_more from the Aegean region that suffered an earlier bout of &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; &quot; Despite 40 years of communism , nationalism has proved durable enough and attractive enough to interest the younger generation , &quot; said Evgeny Ekov , a portly 33-year-old who is part of the revolutionary organization ' s national leadership in Sofia . &quot; Some people will defend Vardar Macedonia because of family ties , but others simply because they realize it is the right thing to do. &quot; As has become common in the war-ravaged Balkans , Ekov tends to see clear strategy in what is more likely gesture , interpreting American participation in the meager U.N. peacekeeping force for Macedonia as an ironclad guarantee that Washington will never let that republic suffer the same fate as battle-torn Bosnia . Most activists in the revolutionary organization expect the United States to protect Macedonia , noting that otherwise the whole of the Balkans will be drawn by cross-border ethnic links into the conflagration . &quot; Bulgarians are sensitive about Macedonia because a lot of Bulgarian blood has been spilled there , &quot; says Georgy Todev , a 73-year-old who spent a dozen years in prison for revolutionary organization activity while it was banned . &quot; Zhelev will do whatever he can to keep Bulgaria neutral , and I believe he is sincerely working for that , &quot; the white-haired revolutionary says , hoisting up his black wool sweater to reveal a pistol tucked into his belt . &quot; But if the war spills_over to Macedonia , Zhelev will not be able to do anything . No one will be able to stop us. &quot; Bulgaria ' s sorry history in past Balkan conflicts seems to weigh little in the minds of Pirin peasants , who have convinced themselves that 19th-Century battle tactics and weaponry that is scarcely newer will suffice in a faceoff with Serbian-led Yugoslavia , Albanian separatists or NATO-member Greece . &quot; No country can count_on continuous military successes , &quot; Ekov says of the neighbor states that defeated Bulgaria in 1912 and 1913 Balkan bloodlettings and in both world_wars . &quot; We don ' t foresee a fifth victory by other powers. &quot; Reminded that Serbs command the third-largest army on the Continent , Ekov contends that &quot; nationalist energy can be channeled to make_up for any technical inadequacies. &quot; The revolutionary organization was founded in 1893 with the aim of reviving Bulgarian national consciousness after 500 years of rule by the Turks . In its first decade , it gained a reputation as one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in Europe as it ambushed , tortured and killed in a failed campaign for liberation . Nowhere was its underground activity so well-organized and successfully masked as in this rugged mountain stronghold , known before World_War_II as Nevrokop . Gotse Delchev , a teacher , helped build a network of shadow governments , schools and other institutions in preparation for the day when revolutionaries would be able to drive_out the Turks . Delchev was captured and executed even before the movement staged its ill-fated rebellion in 1903 , but his efforts won him the respect of Slavs throughout Macedonia . Antonina Zhelyazkova , a specialist in Ottoman history who heads the International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations , says the dispute over Macedonia is an &quot; invented problem , &quot; but one that has the potential to throw Bulgaria back into the carnage of Delchev ' s time . She expresses confidence that no Bulgarian group , no matter how radical , will provoke fighting with Serbs , Greeks or Albanians . But if any of those forces invade Macedonia , &quot; our nationalists would participate gladly. &quot; Zhelyazkova sees trouble for Bulgaria in the event of Macedonian fighting , even if Bulgarians can somehow be compelled to stay within their own borders . Any influx of refugees would strain an already bankrupt social_system and change the delicate balances in Pirin Macedonia ' s Orthodox and Muslim communities . The revolutionary organization ' s unfettered , nationalist saber-rattling has already fueled antagonism toward Bulgaria ' s 1-million-strong ethnic Turkish minority by reviving Slav resentment of descendants of Ottoman occupiers . Mavrodiev , the self-styled revolutionary organization warrior , belabors claims that the Turks are trying to assimilate Bulgaria ' s Muslim Slav population , which , as in Bosnia , is a legacy of Ottoman rule . Stoyan Boyadjiev , the revolutionary_group ' s national president , also rails against what he calls Greek and Yugoslav Communist-era perfidy against the Bulgars , reciting statistics of post-World War II expulsions , executions and internment . The inflammatory campaigns against rival religions and ideologies exacerbate fears of moderates that nationalism is strengthening its hand in deceptively placid Bulgaria . Those concerns are not eased by growing signs of extremist sentiment and intolerance that foretell another impassioned quest to reverse perceived wrongs against the Bulgarian nation . Across the roadside wall of a whitewashed farmhouse in the nearby town of Melnik , someone has scrawled a warning in red spray paint that seems to express the belligerent spirit of Bulgarians poisoned by nostalgia and nationalism . &quot; God forgives , &quot; the graffiti read . &quot; The ( revolutionary organization ) doesn ' t. &quot; Williams , The Times ' Vienna Bureau chief , recently was_on assignment in Sofia . Bulgaria at a Glance Population : 8.5 million Area : 42 # 855 square_miles ( about the size of Ohio ) Monetary unit : Lev Language : Bulgarian Religions : Eastern Orthodox , 27 % ; Muslim , 8 % ( atheist , 65 % ) Economic activity : Processes agriculture , mineral , timber products ; manufactures machinery , electronics . The history of Bulgaria clearly bears the marks of the long strife in the Balkans : First Bulgarians , horsemen akin to Huns , crossed Danube in 600s , subjugating Slavs in area but adopting Slavic dialect and customs * After Serbs subjected their kingdom in 1330 , Bulgars gradually fell prey to Turks * From 1396 to 1878 , Bulgaria a Turkish province * In 1878 Russian forced Turkey to accord Bulgaria independence , but European intervention caused it to be made an autonomous state under Turkish sovereignty . * Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha declared country independent , himself Tsar in 1908 * Bulgaria sided with Germany twice in the great_wars , though it resisted sending its troops against Russia in World_War_II and briefly declared war on Germany before Russian troops streamed in . * A Soviet-style republic was established in 1947 and Bulgaria became one of Moscow ' s most slavish satellites .</TEXT>
