   <TEXT> Maybe Shirley MacLaine has been razzed for her metaphysical beliefs often enough and drawn enough cutting reviews to explain her prickly , often openly disdainful attitude during a recent interview . She gave one-word answers to some questions and banned certain topics , namely metaphysics . Whenever the phone rang , MacLaine answered , even though an assistant and her manager were_on hand . One conversation dragged_on for 15 minutes without so_much as a &quot; pardon me. &quot; While she refuses anymore to discuss the other-dimensional fascination she revealed more_than a decade ago in her bestseller , &quot; Out on a Limb , &quot; she did say she hasn ' t minded most of the ribbing -- only the bad jokes and the fact that &quot; interviews always veer off to that &quot; subject . The jokes , at least , come less frequently nowadays . MacLaine thinks it is partly because her attitude toward spiritual exploration has become so &quot; mainstream. &quot; Fortunately , she brightened considerably when addressing subjects that do interest her . Like the one-woman show she ' s performing tonight through Sunday -- to open the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts ' third season . She also seemed genuinely enthusiastic about discussing her writing . Each of her seven books has been a bestseller . Her eighth ( she won ' t divulge the subject ) is_due this summer . The world-traveled actress , dancer , singer and author recalled some colorful anecdotes from a still-active , distinguished 40-year , 40-plus-film career . During that time , she has amassed five Emmy awards , six Oscar nominations -- winning the best actress award for &quot; Terms of Endearment &quot; in 1983 -- and legions of fans . And theatrical magic happened when , for an instant during the interview , she assumed the character of Aurora Greenway , whom she played in &quot; Terms of Endearment &quot; and will reprise in &quot; Evening Star. &quot; She expects to start filming the sequel this spring . * MacLaine , 60 , wore a long , loose-fitting natural-fiber brown shift for the interview in her beachfront apartment , one of six in a building she owns . Her reddish-brown hair , cut_in that trademark pixie , softly framed her clear green eyes , ringed by those starry black lashes . Her living room , just a_few feet from the surf , is decorated with Japanese prints , photographs of the actress with brother Warren Beatty , Liza Minnelli and other stars , and one that pictures what appears to be an Eastern guru sort . She was happiest to talk_about her singing , dancing revue , which she called &quot; completely new. &quot; It contains Mama Rose songs from &quot; Gypsy &quot; and other material from the show she performed at Anaheim ' s Celebrity Theatre in 1991 , her most recent Orange County appearance . &quot; I love ' Gypsy , ' &quot; she said , sipping iced_tea , &quot; but I never wanted to go_to Broadway and commit to a run of the play , so I do a kind of mini-Gypsy musical . Then I do a whole , long medley about a woman ' s ups-and-downs in her relationship with love , almost 70 songs . . . . A show like this evolves , you take_out whole hunks and put_in new whole hunks . Age hasn ' t made_it much more difficult to perform the 90-minute show , she said , providing she eats properly ( &quot; sugar , that ' s my downfall &quot; ) and maintains an exercise program to keep her body &quot; aligned. &quot; &quot; I just finished playing in Canada , &quot; she said , &quot; and I played a couple dates at Disney World in Florida . And I had the urge to go_to Argentina , so I played it down there ( in May ) , and in Brazil . It ' s great to have a show like this because you can travel and do what you love to do at the same time. &quot; The fun comes from getting_to know her audiences , she said . In South_America , for instance , after mixing with folks at local eateries and reading the papers , she spoke on stage &quot; about what was going_on in Sao Paulo , or in Rio or wherever. &quot; &quot; They love the familiarity that you might have with what their lives are , and I love to be a part of what ' s happening when I ' m there. &quot; The Norwegian government loved her in a big way when years ago she helped them save face . MacLaine was about to appear in Norway at a $ 100-per-seat grand opening for a new , government-funded theater when its director approached her shortly before curtain . An electrical_storm , he told her , combined with some unresolved technical bugs , could mean trouble . He &quot; came_to me and my people , &quot; she recalled , &quot; and said , ' Look , with the storm outside , there ' s no ( electrical ) ground in this theater , so we can guarantee against loss of equipment , but we can ' t guarantee against loss of life. ' &quot; The actress still gets a great laugh out of that line , reiterating it with a hearty laugh . She decided to go_on , she said , which ultimately resulted in her decision to hire a new vocal coach . For safety ' s sake , she performed the &quot; whole show without a microphone. &quot; MacLaine , who had never &quot; even hardly written a letter &quot; before publishing her first book , started to write mostly because of her extensive travels , some of which she describes in her books . &quot; I just decided I wanted to share a lot of the things I experienced , I guess . . . and I loved it , I love the feeling . I ' m in better health when I write . There ' s nothing like having your thoughts well ordered . &quot; I don ' t consider myself a really good writer . I just am a clear thinker and I put the thoughts down with one word , simple . It ' s not an extensive vocabulary , but it ' s clear. &quot; * Born in Richmond , Va. , MacLaine studied ballet as a girl . Shortly after high_school , she got work in New York as a chorus_girl and was picked to understudy Carol Haney , the lead in &quot; The Pajama Game &quot; on Broadway . One night in 1954 she went_on for the injured star , got raves and a plane_ticket west . Producer Hal Wallis had seen the show and offered her a movie contract . * Since her first film , &quot; The Trouble With Harry &quot; ( 1955 ) , she has played diverse characters ranging from a helpless waif in &quot; The Apartment &quot; ( 1960 ) to a smarmy hooker in &quot; Irma La Douce &quot; ( 1963 ) . Her more recent movies include &quot; Steel Magnolias &quot; ( 1989 ) , &quot; Postcards From the Edge &quot; ( 1990 ) and &quot; Guarding Tess , &quot; which came_out last March . She often rejects inferior scripts , she said , and is &quot; amazed &quot; at what does get produced . &quot; So , &quot; she added wryly , &quot; is the audience. &quot; She has no qualms , however , about revisiting Aurora Greenway . In &quot; Evening_Star , &quot; the willful , overbearing matriarch , now 20 years older , realizes that she has not done a good job raising the grown children of her deceased daughter , played in &quot; Terms of Endearment &quot; by Debra Winger . Aurora ' s grandchildren &quot; are an unmitigated disaster , every one of them , &quot; said MacLaine , effortlessly taking_on Greenway ' s perturbed air and clipped speech . &quot; And she doesn ' t understand why . Why can ' t children just enjoy their lives and not be so upset with things , and why do they take dope and why is he in prison and why did she get knocked_up by this person . &quot; Greenway goes_to a psychiatrist to get some help , but ends_up seducing the good doctor , 30 years her junior . &quot; So the therapy isn ' t going_to work very well , &quot; MacLaine said , chuckling at the scenario . &quot; It ' s wonderful. &quot; * Shirley MacLaine will perform her one-woman show at 8 tonight , Saturday and Sunday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts , 12700 Center Court Drive , Cerritos . $ 35-62 . ( 800 ) 300-4345 . She will reprise parts of the show with Pacific Symphony on Nov . 18 and 19 at 8 p.m. and Nov . 20 at 3 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center , 600 Town Center Drive , Costa Mesa . $ 22- $ 53 .
