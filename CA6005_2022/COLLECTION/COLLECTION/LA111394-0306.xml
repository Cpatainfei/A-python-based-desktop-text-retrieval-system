   <TEXT> Don Feeney had been out of prison only two weeks and all he wanted to do was spend time with his family and rebuild his business . If anyone had told him he would go right back_off on another risky foreign_mission , the kind of high-adrenaline project that had landed him in an Iceland hoosegow in the first place , the fast-talking , Brooklyn-born Feeney would ' ve laughed in his face . But when Connie Ghozzi walked through his door , neither Feeney nor his wife , Judy , could say no . Ghozzi ' s 4-year-old son , Elias , had been kidnaped , spirited away to Tunisia by her ex-husband the day before a custody hearing . For a year , she had tried everything to recover her son , even paying nearly $ 100 # 000 to men who promised they could snatch Elias back . She turned_to the Feeneys in desperation , traveling from her home_in Oklahoma to see them last February . &quot; You could tell by looking_at her that her heart had been ripped away , &quot; Judy Feeney said . So the Feeneys swung into action . Corporate Training Unlimited , the company Don Feeney founded in 1985 with a team of former members of the anti-terrorist Delta Force , was designed to offer training and security services to executives working overseas . But retrieving kidnaped children has developed_into a flashier , if controversial , sideline . The Feeneys say they have recovered 18 kidnaped children and adults -- including the September return of Arcadia resident Michelle Neserri ' s 2-year-old son from Iraq . The State_Department , which reports 1 # 200 active custody_cases involving an American child abroad , tries to assist parents through legal channels . It frowns_on the type of abductions the Feeneys engineer . &quot; There is concern if a child is abducted once and then is abducted again , that it can keep the chain of abductions going , &quot; said a State_Department spokeswoman . &quot; It doesn ' t really resolve anything. &quot; Other concerns include the potential of physical danger to the children , and the myriad implications of breaking the laws of other countries . The Feeneys themselves want their clients to exhaust legal remedies first . But only 37 countries have signed an international accord on custody issues . In the Middle_East , where the Feeneys stage most of their recoveries , only Israel is a party to the accord . The upshot is that custody orders issued by U.S. courts can be as meaningless as &quot; potty paper &quot; overseas , said Judy Feeney . The couple , and a small number of other similar firms , consider themselves &quot; the court of last resort. &quot; To pull_off their recoveries , CTU operatives have posed as movie_makers , fought_off angry mobs and snatched a child from a crowded school_bus . It is an incongruous image : macho ex-Delta Force members applying the blunt skills of their trade to accomplish the most delicate of missions : extricating children from the embrace of a faraway parent . It was in the middle of such a mission in 1993 that Don Feeney was arrested . CTU operatives flew to Reykjavik , Iceland , posing as location scouts for a film that would star Sylvester Stallone and Kim Basinger . In truth , CTU was working for James Grayson , a Florida resident who accused his ex-wife of snatching their daughter nine months earlier . The CTU team befriended the ex-wife , Erna Eyjolfsdottir , convincing her that they would hire her as a production aide . Actually , two children were involved in the case . Eyjolfsdottir had fled with her two daughters just as a Florida judge was about to take them away from her and give custody to the fathers , the woman ' s two ex-husbands . After going_out partying with Eyjolfsdottir one night , the operatives took the children while she slept . Waking_up to find her daughters gone , she was able to get customs officials to stop Don Feeney , Grayson and Grayson ' s daughter at the airport . Judy Feeney and another operative had boarded an earlier plane with the other girl but were intercepted in Luxembourg . The girl was returned to Iceland . Feeney and Grayson were both sentenced to prison . Grayson was sentenced to three months . Feeney was sentenced to two years and served one year , including six months in isolation after he escaped and was recaptured . * Mention the Feeneys and the tendency is to talk_of the adventures , the close_calls , the hair-raising escapes . But Judy Feeney complains that news_stories have lavished too_much attention on the derring-do and not enough on the tender objects of their mercy . The couple love_children -- that ' s why they do what they do , she said . Pictures of_their_own three children hang_on a wall_in her office located in a one-story building not far from Ft . Bragg , where the Army ' s top-secret Delta Force operation is based . The sign above the door is for a security-guard firm . that ' s because , while Don , 41 , was in prison , CTU languished and Judy Feeney , 38 , focused her energies on the couple ' s other , more mundane business of supplying guards to local companies . The Feeneys are working to return CTU to profitability by focusing more on corporate security and crisis-management training , providing they get the time between retrieving children . The expensive child-recovery operations that have gained the couple notoriety usually cost more_than the client is able to pay , they said . Costs can vary widely , but expenses alone can run_into the tens of thousands of dollars . On one of their early missions they went $ 36 # 000 into debt , said Judy Feeney . &quot; Of course we like to get a payday , &quot; she said . &quot; We finally made a mortgage payment on_time . that ' s a good feeling . . . . But a lot of times I don ' t have the luxury of making_good business decisions. &quot; A reminder of why they take_on the unprofitable child rescues sits on a sideboard in Judy ' s office -- a color photograph of Brittney Chowdhury , a 5-year-old Oklahoma girl they recovered from Bangladesh , where she had been taken by her father in 1989 , days before a scheduled divorce hearing . For Judy Feeney it was a special case , the first in which she was a full participant , going undercover , hatching plots , exposing herself to the same dangers as her husband . &quot; We found her living like an animal , &quot; she said of Brittney . &quot; She couldn ' t even eat with utensils . Her hair had lice in it . . . . We ' ve pulled some kids out of some pretty hellacious situations. &quot; The first attempt to rescue Brittney failed . A CTU operative , using the firm ' s favorite ruse , contacted the father , Mohammed Chowdhury , claiming to be a movie location scout in need of an English-speaking guide . But Chowdhury became suspicious and broke_off contact . When they tried again months later , the Feeneys used Terry Chowdhury , Mohammed ' s estranged second wife , as bait . She had become friends with Keli Chowdhury , Brittney ' s mother , and was willing to do anything -- even fake a reconciliation with Mohammed -- to help . For a week , Mohammed virtually lived with Terry at her hotel . The Feeneys and Terry communicated through written notes , which they left taped beneath a sink_in the women ' s restroom . At first , Mohammed was suspicious of the Feeneys , the American couple he often saw around the hotel . But when he heard that Don Feeney was a New York investment consultant interested in opening a textile factory , he stunned the Feeneys by approaching him to discuss a job . The two couples ended_up having dinner together . Terry eventually learned of Brittney ' s whereabouts . To get Mohammed out of the way , the Feeneys sent him to Bangkok , Thailand , on a ruse . There a CTU operative roughed him up and told him never to go near either Terry or Keli again . Meanwhile , the Feeneys went_to the home of Mohammed ' s family to get Brittney . An angry crowd surrounded them when it became clear what they were doing . While Keli sang nursery_rhymes to soothe the child , Don drove_back the mob with a telescoping police baton and had to forcefully restrain Mohammed ' s father , who tried to snatch the girl back . A Bangladesh judge refused to grant Keli permanent custody unless Brittney ' s father was present . But the Feeneys managed to elude armed guards who had been stationed outside their hotel and left the country with the child . * If the Feeneys have an image problem , it is partly their own doing . Don , who grew_up in a rough-and-tumble New York neighborhood , has the tough-guy moves and patter of a young James Cagney . He does not try to hide a hair-trigger temper . He resigned from the Army in 1984 after 16 years of service rather than accept disciplinary action . He and other Delta Force members working undercover in Beirut were expected to live like Foreign Service personnel , but on a smaller Army per diem . A deal was worked_out with hoteliers so that the Delta Force received cut_rates and kickbacks . Feeney insists the arrangement was necessary for the successful fulfillment of the mission , but the Army says he and the other soldiers were guilty of financial irregularities . Judy was never in the military , but she is an Army brat with a lifelong love of shooting . But , despite their image as weapon-slinging swashbucklers , Judy Feeney said they never carry guns on recovery missions , especially when children are involved . The Neserri case was the first in which CTU worked in cooperation with government officials . After Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) took an interest in the case , the Los Angeles district_attorney ' s office and then the FBI got involved . They enlisted Scotland_Yard to help after the Feeneys concocted a plan to lure Neserri ' s estranged Iraqi husband to London with the child . When he stepped off the plane at Heathrow Airport , he was immediately taken into custody and the child was taken_away . More typical was the operation to retrieve Connie Ghozzi ' s son last spring . She had been warned to stay_away_from CTU . &quot; All I ever heard was negative things about them , &quot; she said . The State_Department , for example , contends that the Feeneys ' extralegal activities not only can cause diplomatic problems , but can put the children in physical danger and also cause them psychological damage . People who knew of their exploits told her they were reckless and foolhardy . &quot; I think some of the ( Feeney recoveries ) could very well put some of the children through trauma and danger , &quot; said Judy Shretter , legal director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . The center , like the State_Department , prefers that parents pursue legal means of regaining custody of snatched children . In Ghozzi ' s case , though , the State_Department said they couldn ' t help . Under the Feeneys ' guidance , she persuaded her Tunisian husband in a series of telephone_conversations that she wanted a reconciliation . During the year of separation from her son , she had in fact already tried moving to Tunisia to be with him . But she realized she couldn ' t stay after a week in that country . The isolation -- from her culture , her language , her friends -- was too great . Also , she said , her husband ' s family treated her &quot; like dirt , &quot; as if she were an outsider and Elias was their child . She moved_back to Tunisia early this year . At first , she said , she wasn ' t allowed to be alone with Elias and was locked_in her room at night . Eventually , as she won her estranged husband ' s trust , she was allowed to take Elias on walks . Enter the Feeneys , masquerading as Americans interested in importing Tunisian wine . They made the family ' s acquaintance , which enabled them to observe close_up . In telephone_calls , Judy would advise Ghozzi on what to say and how to behave and learn more about the family ' s routine . Then came the time , on one of her walks with Elias , to make_good her escape . Ghozzi arrived_at the point where she was to meet a Feeney operative , only to find no one there . She panicked . Remembering other would-be rescuers , she thought : &quot; It ' s happened to me again . I ' ve been duped again. &quot; As Ghozzi fretted about what to do , a hulking Irishman suddenly appeared in her path , pretending to tie his shoe . Without looking_up , he told her in his Irish lilt to turn left and get_in a gray Peugeot nearby . The man was the CTU operative . He had been delayed briefly checking on the boat they needed . Soon , Ghozzi and her son were_on the high_seas , speeding to Italy . * If Don Feeney has to break the laws of foreign nations to accomplish his missions , he does_it without a twinge of guilt . His philosophy now is the same as when he worked for the government : He doesn ' t mind breaking rules if he feels he is justified . He is an ex-Army sniper who survived the ill-fated government mission to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980 . &quot; When I became a sniper for the Army , they put you through a psychological test , &quot; he said . The administrator of the test told him a sniper could not have a conscience . Feeney disagreed . &quot; You must have a conscience to be a sniper. &quot; A good soldier trusts his superiors , &quot; but I ' m not a blind sheep . If they told me Ronald Reagan had become a communist and must be killed , I ' m not going_to do_it . It ' ll be a cold day in hell before I kill the President because you tell me to. &quot; He passed the test . Recalling his Beirut financial hijinks , Feeney said : &quot; Was it wrong what we did ? Yes , but it was justified. &quot; Similarly , recovering snatched children might be sneered at by U.S. officials and might break the laws of the countries where the recoveries are staged , but the Feeneys keep_on doing_it . They feel they are justified .</TEXT>
