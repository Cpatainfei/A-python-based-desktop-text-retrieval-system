   <HEADLINE> SUIT CHALLENGES ASSISTED-SUICIDE LAW IN OREGON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A group of doctors and patients is suing to block Oregon ' s new law allowing physician-assisted suicide , saying it is unconstitutional and will pressure sick people to end their lives . The measure narrowly approved by voters Nov . 8 would allow doctors , under certain conditions , to prescribe lethal drugs to patients with less than six months to live.It is to take_effect Dec . 8 . &quot; Something needs to be done to protect the patients from this bill , &quot; said Dr. Gary Lee , who is suing with another doctor and several disabled or terminally ill patients . &quot; The safeguards are really inadequate . When people become seriously ill , when they are diagnosed with cancer , they become vulnerable to a lot of factors , &quot; Lee said . &quot; They may become depressed. &quot; Attorney Thomas Alderman , who filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday in Eugene , said the measure violates the Constitution ' s equal protection and due_process guarantees , as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . The lawsuit was expected by supporters of the suicide measure .</TEXT>
