   <HEADLINE> COURT REFUSES TO PROBE STARR ' S POLITICS ; WHITEWATER : SEN . LEVIN SOUGHT AN EXAMINATION OF THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL ' S GOP ACTIVITIES . DEMOCRATS , CITING BIAS ISSUE , STEP_UP CRITICISM OF PROSECUTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A special three-judge court refused Thursday to look_into the political activities of independent Whitewater counsel Kenneth W . Starr , saying that it lacked any power to do so . Sen . Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) , leading Senate sponsor of the independent counsel law , urged the court last Friday to ask Starr for &quot; a complete accounting &quot; of his recent Republican political activities and to either ask him to resign or explain why the activities do not impair his &quot; appearance of independence. &quot; The panel two weeks ago appointed Starr , solicitor_general during the George_Bush Administration , to replace Robert B . Fiske Jr. , who had been named by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno seven months ago after an earlier independent counsel law had expired . In turning_down Reno ' s request that it name Fiske under a newly signed law , the court said that it was &quot; in the best interest of the appearance of independence &quot; to choose a person not affiliated with the Clinton_Administration . The court ' s refusal came as Democrats stepped_up their criticism , saying that the selection of Starr violated the same standard that the court had cited in removing Fiske . Levin , in his letter to Judge David B . Sentelle , who presides over the special panel , cited Starr ' s role as co-chair of a Republican congressional campaign in Virginia and his participation in a televised debate on the sexual_harassment suit brought against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones , a former Arkansas state employee . Starr also has come under_attack for working_on a legal_brief for a conservative women ' s organization that challenges the President ' s claim of immunity in the Paula Jones suit . Levin disputed the court_order , saying : &quot; Not only do they have such authority , but they alone have the authority. &quot; Starr ' s appointment also has been criticized because Judge Sentelle had lunch with Sen . Lauch Faircloth ( R-N.C. ) , a leading advocate of removing Fiske , while the special court was weighing who it should name as independent counsel . Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) , a leading supporter of Sentelle when he was named to the bench , joined Faircloth and Sentelle at the lunch . They have denied discussing the appointment . Starr has rejected Democratic calls_for him to step_down , noting that his &quot; sole loyalty &quot; is to the Constitution and the laws of the United States . In turning Levin down , the special court said that the law authorizing the court did not contemplate the accounting from Starr that he sought . The independent counsel act &quot; simply does not give &quot; the special court &quot; the power to ' supervise ' the independent counsel in the exercise of his or her investigative or prosecutorial authority , &quot; it said , citing a 1988 Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the independent counsel law . It added that Levin had sought a &quot; supplementary opinion passing_on the fitness of an independent counsel already appointed and as_to whom the court has no current power of either supervision or termination. &quot;</TEXT>
