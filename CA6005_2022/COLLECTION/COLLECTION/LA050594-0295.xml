   <HEADLINE> INSIDE OUT : FASHION ; SUPPORT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We may have just moved_into a place that looks straight out of &quot; Leave It to Beaver , &quot; but so far , the spirit of June has eluded us . Would Mrs . Cleaver have forgotten where she ' d packed her underwear ? Not likely . Ours , on the other hand , was missing in action . So we did what we always do_in time of crisis : headed for Bullock ' s . We try not to jiggle in a textured microfiber pantsuit . It isn ' t easy . Stomach muscles taut , bosom sagging , we avoided eye_contact -- first with the crew of house_painters who politely ignored us , then with those hard-bodied makeup salesgirls who flanked our route to the lingerie department . We loaded_up on Adrienne Vittadini ' s failed attempt at undergarments , 50 % off . Our intention was to slip the stuff on in the ladies lounge . Then we remembered the wicked story we ' d just heard at a party . It seems a legendary bulimic was outed by a woman who ' d followed her to the ladies room . The spy spotted bulimia ' s tell-tale sign : feet pointed the wrong direction in the stall . Days later , the story came_back to haunt us . Did we really want to risk being outed as a public restroom underwear changer ? Who knew who might be watching ? We jiggled all_the way home . * Cover Shots : We love Madonna . So sue us . So does Jonathan Van Meter . So fire him . Never mind . He already quit . The former editor in chief of our favorite fashion-pop culture magazine , Vibe , was ordered to yank Madonna off the cover of the June-July issue by one of his bosses , Vibe founder and record producer Quincy Jones , according to the New York Times . Executives at the magazine declined to comment Tuesday , saying it is not their practice to discuss editorial decisions . Some insiders suggest that Madonna isn ' t the fresh , hot young thing she once was , while others say she ' s the wrong color . Hey , the lily-white Beastie Boys made the cut this month . But then one of the Beasties was just convicted of beating_up a tabloid television cameraman . . . . * One Very Hot Trend : The people at the Mohair Council of America are reveling in mohair ' s recent starring role in many_a designer ' s fall collections . We wonder how they ' re reacting to an incident in which actress Fran Drescher leaned her mohair-sweater-wearing torso into some votives and caught_fire ? With surprise , it seems . &quot; Mohair is sort of self-extinguishing , like wool , &quot; said Madeline Daddiego , director of promotions for the New York-based Mohair Council of America . &quot; I bet she was wearing one of those brushed mohair sweaters . And the candle singed the hairs , like when your hair catches fire. &quot; At any rate , mohair is a big trend for fall and we should know that the United States is the largest mohair-producing country in the world . Just keep the stuff away from open flames . * The Land That Time Forgot : Just because we ' re not a country_music fan doesn ' t mean we turn_a_blind_eye to that particular fashion scene . And what better place than the Academy of Country_Music Awards ceremony Tuesday night for checking out the biggest hair and sparkliest gowns this side of a wax museum ? Not everyone , of course , stuck_to the program . With her stick-straight unsprayed hair and shapeless black pants outfit , Mary-Chapin Carpenter risked -- in this crowd at any rate -- looking_like a cross-dresser . Then there was the eerie sight of Randy Travis gone Hollywood . The singer-turned-aspiring-actor was clad in a beautifully cut neutral-colored suit with matching buttoned-up shirt , no tie and soft , wavy hair . We mistook him for Harry Hamlin till we heard the nasal_twang . But elsewhere it was business as usual . Young , pretty Faith Hill accepted her award as top new female vocalist looking_like an over-teased , over-aged beauty queen . Reba McEntire performed a novelty song wearing rows and rows of blue fringe and matching Wonder_Woman boots . The menfolk sported get-ups that ranged from show co-host Alan Jackson ' s sleeveless Hank Williams T-shirt tucked into skin-tight beltless jeans to a handful of leather tuxedo jackets . The must-have accessory ? A 10-gallon hat . * Contempo Casualties : News that the Boston-based Neiman Marcus Group would close 50 of its 288 Contempo Casuals stores -- primarily in the Los Angeles area -- hasn ' t quite registered with some of the troops . A salesclerk at a local Contempo Casuals had heard that some stores would be shut , but insisted that &quot; it ' s for a positive reason . Nothing negative . They ' ve given us limited information , but none of us will lose our jobs . we ' ll all be reassigned. &quot; That came as a surprise to Joanne Parker , director of corporate relations , who told us that underperforming stores would be shut as early as the end of July , and up_to 1 # 000 area employees terminated . The problem with stores that cater to the junior customer , Parker said , is that the clientele prefers to wear basics -- like those sold at the Gap . They could find such basics at Neiman Marcus , couldn ' t they ? &quot; We would n ' t complain about that , &quot; Parker allowed . * Book Report : The alleged indiscriminate gay encounters and copious drug use have been hashed_over by the media . Here ' s the skinny on the second wave of intimacies shared_in &quot; Obsession : The Lives and Times of Calvin Klein , &quot; straight from co-author Steven Gaines . On Klein ' s marriage to pretty , preppy assistant designer Kelly Rector : &quot; It is a real , deeply committed marriage . She wanted to live_in a fantasy_world . . . . He wanted to be_on the cutting edge of lifestyle movements : When it became hip_to be clean and sober , he joined rehab . When it was hip in nouvelle society to be a mogul with a trophy wife , he married. &quot; On Klein ' s request that no one assist Gaines and co-author Sharon Churcher in their research : &quot; It brought people out of the woodwork . No one likes to be told what to do . Intimates , intimates , of Calvin ' s came forward. &quot; On Gaines ' next project : &quot; A brilliant American success story , one of the most powerful men in America , he speed dials the White_House -- David Geffen. &quot; * A Mink of One ' s Own : Leave it to mink-wearing fashion correspondent Richard ( you should call him &quot; Mr. &quot; ) Blackwell to turn_up at a fashion soiree without a pen . Better you should forget the fur , sir ! But then , we all have our politically incorrect weaknesses . ( Ours is blood-red steak. ) Let ' s hope someone else ' s is celebrity-designed Levi ' s jackets because a_hundred of them will be auctioned June 18 at the Century Plaza Hotel to benefit the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS ( DIFFA ) . At a preview cocktail_party last week , we noted our favorites : a button-covered version created by costume_designer May Routh ; Glenn Close ' s &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; interpretation -- complete with leopard spots and turban -- and the Whoopi Goldberg jacket , featuring curled yarn dreadlocks . * Inside Out is published Thursdays .</TEXT>
