   <TEXT> After every big earthquake , you say to yourself , &quot; Gosh , I really ought to stock up_on all those supplies I didn ' t have. &quot; Or : &quot; Gee , it would have been nice if I had had a quake game_plan with my family or with my neighbors. &quot; Time goes_by , the next quake hits and there you are , without a flashlight and without a clue as_to who lives next door . Here it is -- what you need to have , what you ought to know before a quake comes . SUPPLIES The California Office of Emergency Services advises supplies for a minimum of 72 hours of self-sufficiency . Home * A flashlight and fresh batteries or rechargeable flashlights should be handy in every room . It doesn ' t do much good if you are in bed when a quake strikes and your flashlight is in the kitchen . * Three- to four-day food supply per person . * Two gallons of water per day per person . * Tools such_as crescent wrench to turn_off gas and water ( learn how to use beforehand ) , hammer , screwdrivers ( flat and Phillips ) , shovel , ax , crowbar . * Portable radio and batteries . ( Portable TV and batteries , if you want more_than audio contact. ) * Water purification tablets . * Fire_extinguisher ( learn how to use it beforehand ) . * Manual can_opener . * Cash . * Paper plates , cups and plastic utensils . * Blankets . * Comfortable clothes and shoes . * Barbecue grill and charcoal . * Matches . * First-aid_kit . * Resealable plastic bags for human_waste . * Large trash bags . * Thick-soled shoes . * Heavy gloves . * Newspapers .

OFFICE * Extra clothes and comfortable shoes . * Canned fruit and unsalted nuts . * Manual can_opener . * Essential medication . * Portable radio . * Blanket or sleeping bag . FOOD Because grocery_stores may be closed for several days , experts advise keeping a three-day food supply for each individual . Here are some guidelines : * Choose foods that store well without refrigeration , such_as canned meat , fish , soup , macaroni , beans , chili , vegetables , spaghetti , ravioli , fruit , juice , nuts , peanut_butter , jelly , pudding and dried_milk . * Store staples such_as crackers , cereal , rice cakes , snack_bars , dried fruit and legumes in plastic jars . * Buy_foods that are low in sodium . You don ' t want to deplete your water_supply . * Store food in a dark , cool area . * Don ' t forget the fifth major food group : snacks . Chocolate can be soothing after a quake . * Rotate foods once or twice a year to avoid spoilage . * If power is out , first eat food from the refrigerator . Next , freezer food and lastly , non-perishables . ( Frozen food lasts several days if the freezer door is kept closed. ) * Do not use canned_foods that are bulging or leaking . * Do not use food from open containers near broken glass or spilled household chemicals . * Do not eat perishable foods that become warm . Bacteria grow rapidly without refrigeration and may cause food_poisoning . WATER Keeping water in your body is critical . Symptoms of mild dehydration include impatience , fatigue , emotional instability and apathy . Symptoms of severe dehydration include headache , sunken eyes and cheeks , difficulty breathing , weakness , mental_confusion and rapid but weak pulse . Here ' s what you ' ll need : * 2 gallons of water per day per person . * Alternate sources of water are soda beverages , melted ice or snow , liquid from canned_foods , toilet tanks ( not bowls ) -- a toilet tank can provide up_to 7 gallons of water . Do not drink if chemical disinfectant or bluing agent was used . * To rely_on a hot water_heater for drinking_water , flush at least once every 6 months to remove rust and mineral deposits . * Don ' t drink water stored in vinyl plastic containers , such_as water_beds . * Quickly running water from streams should be filtered and purified . * Dew does not usually require purification . It can be collected by wiping from low vegetation , rocks and grasses with a rag . PURIFYING WATER Dysentery , infectious_hepatitis and typhoid_fever are diseases that can result from contaminated water . After an earthquake , you can ' t assume water from water_lines or reservoirs is pure . Instead , choose one of the following purification methods : * Boiling -- Boil water vigorously for five minutes . Without power , place a steel cup directly over hot coals until red hot , then place directly into container of water . * Filtering -- Allow collected water to stand_for several hours to settle heavier_particles . Pour the clearer water through a piece of cotton cloth so the suspended particles are filtered . Repeat until water is clear . * Purification Tablets -- Effective in removing most biological pollutants ; available at drugstores . INFANTS The following items should be_on hand for babies , says Dr. Neil Kaufman , head of ambulatory pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center : * Extra packages of disposable diapers . * Water and other liquids . ( &quot; Babies can live without food for several days , &quot; he says , &quot; but they need a minimum of 1 1 / 2 ounces of liquid per pound each day. &quot; ) * At least a three-day supply of ready-made formula . * An extra supply of baby food . If you run_out , it ' s perfectly fine for parents to chew_up food for their infants . * An adequate supply of food for breast-feeding mothers . ( &quot; Nursing moms should add 20 % to 30 % more calories and hydration to the average adult requirements , &quot; Kaufman says. ) PETS According to Warren Eckstein , host of KABC-AM radio pet show , you should : * Make_sure your pet has an ID tag with both your home telephone_number and that of a relative in a different area . * Make_sure your pet ' s license is up-to-date . * Make_sure your pet ' s earthquake kit includes leashes , collars , a pet carrier in case of evacuation , a_few days of food and water , and a fresh supply of any special medications . * Keep medical_records on file . * Have your veterinarian ' s phone_number handy . * Establish a relationship with a fellow pet lover in the neighborhood . In case you are not home , there will be someone to help your animal . * Have the telephone_numbers of humane organizations in your area . FIRST_AID Here ' s what you ' ll need : * Prescription medication . * Antibiotic rub . * Pain reliever / aspirin . * Anti-diarrhea medicine . * Laxatives . * Anti-gas medicine . * Dressing materials , including bandages , gauze pads , Ace bandages , tape . MONEY Make_sure you have cash on_hand . ATMs rely_on computers and a continued supply of cash , both of which are affected during major quakes . Merchants may_not accept personal_checks . Credit_cards could also become useless if the electronic network is out_of_commission . HAZARDOUS MATERIALS According to Capt . Ron Leydecker of the Los Angeles City Fire_Department , many common household products pose a risk of fire or accidental poisoning after a quake . Here ' s what you should do beforehand : * Common household cleaners -- such_as chlorine bleach , ammonia and oven cleaner -- should be stored in a safe place . * Keep quantities small and stored in plastic bottles away from ignition sources and living areas . * Chemicals should be secured so they won ' t tip_over in a quake , and locked_up so that children and pets can ' t get access . * Flammable liquids such_as paints should be stored in the garage , but away from such appliances as the hot water_heater and furnace . NEIGHBORS In Scotts Valley , an isolated area near the epicenter of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake , advance planning by a group of residents saved houses and possibly lives . The neighbors learned each other ' s house layouts , and exchanged keys and telephone_numbers . They set_up caches of food , water and emergency supplies . Stephanie Mann , author of &quot; Safe Homes , Safe Neighborhoods &quot; ( Nolo Press , 1993 ) offers advice on organizing : Q . Why are neighbors important after an earthquake ? A . There ' s a lot that neighbors can do for each other . They may rescue your child or pull you out of debris . It ' s important that you know that you may have a doctor , nurse or firefighter in the neighborhood . You also need to help your neighbors . If one house goes , the whole block can go . Q . How can neighbors organize ? A . All 20 houses in my area of Orinda have an emergency neighborhood map with names , phone_numbers and symbols for gas and electricity . We have all agreed that a red symbol on the mailbox indicates a problem and a white symbol indicates that everything is OK . IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS * According to the California Office of Emergency Services , documents should be stored safely in a fireproof storage box or safe deposit_box , a freezer ( with documents tightly sealed_in a freezer bag ) , or with an out-of-town contact ' s residence ( send copies , not originals ) . * To expedite insurance_claims , keep both a written inventory of personal belongings and receipts for major items . * Other papers to store include Social_Security cards , birth_certificates , marriage and death records , drivers licenses , credit_cards , insurance_policies , income_tax_returns , mortgage or rental receipts , paycheck stubs , deeds , stocks and bonds , savings and checking_account books , wills , health history and recent photos of family members .</TEXT>
