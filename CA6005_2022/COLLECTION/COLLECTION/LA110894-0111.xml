   <TEXT> Commemorating the fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , 140 Americans will lay a wreath Wednesday to honor Germans shot while trying to cross the old divide , then hold a candlelight march from the eastern half of the city to the west . The event , organized by the Citizen Ambassador Program of People to People International , from Spokane , Wash. , will follow a day of workshops on efforts to unite the people of eastern and western Germany . The American organization has invited Germans to participate and has the blessing of Berlin City_Hall , says program spokeswoman Barbara Schulte . But she added : &quot; We wish thousands of Germans would participate , but I don ' t think so . Berliners don ' t like a memorial to that date . The wall is still in their heads. &quot;</TEXT>
