   <HEADLINE> CAN JUNIOR_COLLEGES TRAIN WORK_FORCE OF THE FUTURE ? ; EDUCATION : PASADENA CAMPUS IS A MICROCOSM OF STATE ' S UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS . SOME THERE SUCCEED AGAINST LONG ODDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is one of the scariest nightmares about California ' s future : A once-proud state sinks ever deeper into social chaos , millions of unskilled workers mired in poverty , a social fabric unraveled . But there is another , happier scenario : Imagine a California that bristles with renewed prosperity , its have-nots confident that they have a chance to move_up , its labor_force the envy of the world . Which vision will prove closer to the truth ? At Pasadena City College , a diverse array of 26 # 000 students takes courses ranging from remedial English to astrophysics . For a hard-to-track group that drifts in and out of school , the prognosis is murky . Despite serious budget woes , however , the college still provides motivated students an enormous opportunity to move ahead . &quot; My grandmother was in poverty . My mother was in poverty , &quot; says Linda Santana , one of the many striving for a place in the brighter picture . &quot; I don ' t want to be like that. &quot; Not so_long ago , California ' s skilled work_force was valued as one of the state ' s great assets , a potent lure for any employer contemplating a move to the Golden State . Indeed , California possessed more_than a quality work_force ; it had faith that its vast system of higher education would guarantee an unending supply of young people qualified to compete in the world economy . But now , as voters prepare to choose their next governor , the certainties have been shaken . Dramatic population change is transforming the workplace . The state ' s public colleges and universities face an ongoing financial crunch . Southern California ' s economy has been slammed by recession . In the governor ' s race , Gov . Pete Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown have jousted over university tuition and funding . But the issues of worker skill and training have been overshadowed by the hot-button issues of crime and illegal immigration . Nevertheless , experts warn : Unless more people get better skills , the social chasm between rich and poor will only widen further , and a frustrated population of have-nots will remain stuck on the bottom . California ' s long-term strengths , such_as its Pacific location and the presence of leading-edge technologies , do not erase the anxiety . &quot; More_than anything else , we ' ve got_to deal with that problem if we want to survive as a leading state , &quot; declares Donald Vial , senior adviser to the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy . There is no better place to witness the challenge than on the 53 acres of Pasadena City College , a wide-open window into the future of California ' s labor_force . PCC ' s students , like the public , reflect a hodgepodge of economic backgrounds and educational needs . A few are qualified for elite universities . Others absorbed little in high_school . Still others can barely voice simple sentences in English . Many are looking_for a second chance in the workplace . For instructors , it adds_up to a bewildering set of demands : Prepare students for the university classroom . Prepare students for the shop_floor . Teach students to read and write . All the while , budget realities are prompting cutbacks in courses and faculty : &quot; It constantly amazes me how well we do , &quot; declares John Jacobs , a ceramics instructor who coordinates programs for teaching teachers on the campus . To get a sense of PCC ' s heartbeat , meet a_few of the students : &quot; You try to go_to school in the daytime . Then you hire a sitter at night so you can work to pay the sitter you had during the day , &quot; says Robin Owens , 25 , a single mother of two who is studying to become a nurse . &quot; It ' s hard. &quot; Linda Banks , whose course load includes botany , algebra and economics , concedes that she has dropped_out of school several times . But this time will be different , she promises . &quot; I ' m not dropping_out anymore , &quot; said Banks , 38 . Across the room , Kendall Warrick , 33 , peers at a computer_screen , recalling how an algebra tutor helped rescue his plans to become a radiologist . &quot; If you don ' t know something , they ' ll show you the resources , &quot; he says of PCC officials . Throughout California and the nation , many prospective employees do not know a lot of things once considered elementary . Commission after commission laments low student achievement levels . Millions do poorly on tests of simple reading . Employers gripe about the quality of job applicants . In August , the U.S. Department_of_Education reported that 49 % of Californians age 16 and older could not read or do math at levels demanded by contemporary society , about the same levels as for the nation . An earlier study , cited in January by the California Business Roundtable , found that nearly two-thirds of community_college students did not meet college standards for reading and writing . Unless such trends are arrested , many maintain , the state is headed for trouble : &quot; We cannot compete by following a low-skill , low-wage strategy , because the low-wage nations of the world can always make their products for less , &quot; warned the group , which represents major corporations . Yet others say the claim is overstated . Employers emphasize problems of red_tape , crime and high costs more_than a scarcity of know-how , particularly at a time when many Californians are out_of_work or underemployed . On this much , however , the experts agree : Fail to get a decent education , and you ' re at the end of the line for a decent income . Chances for a comfortable livelihood are dismal . Upward mobility ? Forget it . The more people in that fix , goes the thinking , the more anger and polarization society will be forced to cope_with . &quot; The larger concern is the fragmentation of our state -- that we ' re going to have more division between haves and have-nots , good schools and bad schools , good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods , &quot; said Russell W . Rumberger , an economist and education professor at UC Santa Barbara . For Californians seeking a second chance in the workplace , community_colleges are often the logical place to start . Outdoors , on PCC ' s busy quad , a timeless scene is unfolding : Students hurry between buildings , others chat in little clusters . A group huddles around a card_game outside the student_center . There is the occasional strumming of a guitar . But look closely . The student body is 31 % Latino , 36 % Asian or Pacific Islander , 24 % white and 8.5 % African American , according to records from last fall . PCC now offers 120 classes in English as a second language . Other differences from the stereotypes of college life are less obvious . More_than one-third of PCC ' s students may qualify for a program that waives virtually all fees for the financially needy . Are they success stories-in-the-making ? There is reason for hope as well as concern . &quot; You put them in a class where the teacher really cares -- and tells them that their future depends_on what they do now -- and they will respond to that challenge , &quot; declares Sam Soghomonian , a political_science instructor who retired last year after 30 years on campus . &quot; At PCC we ' ve done some marvelous things. &quot; Many of the students are highly motivated and see public education as their best shot at a better life . &quot; You always dream that when you grow_up you ' re going to be different , &quot; says Linda Santana , who still remembers wearing &quot; the same clothes over and over again &quot; in a childhood of poverty . Her goal : to transfer to a University of California campus and pursue a career in psychology . Then the friendly , brown-haired Santana begins to cry as she talks_about PCC and the help she received from a special program that provides mentors , a counselor , writing instruction and extra peer support for Latino students . &quot; Somebody said : ' Knowledge is pain , but it ' s beautiful , ' she recalls . &quot; And it is. &quot; At the community_colleges , knowledge also has been much less expensive than at universities . Fees have gone_up in recent years to $ 13 a credit hour for most degree students , a rate that could mean tuition of as little as $ 156 a semester for a full-time student . A definitive measure on how effective schools like PCC are at helping people move_up -- sort of a batting_average of upward mobility -- remains elusive . A majority of the state ' s 1.3 million community_college students attend part time , often drifting in and out of school and never achieving a degree . Less than one-fourth manage to get a degree , even after several years , according to sketchy data . &quot; If the general public knows that less than one out of four community_college students -- after six years -- gets a degree or certificate or transfers to a four-year college , I think the general public begins to wonder : What are we doing over there ? What kind of education is happening ? &quot; asks Diana Fuentes-Michel , an official with the California Postsecondary Education Commission , a planning agency in Sacramento . Community_college officials respond that such statistics are to be expected , given the types of students they serve and the obstacles many face . Perhaps three out of four go_to school without the goal of a degree , according to the chancellor ' s office . &quot; Our population is so different , that traditional measures are not appropriate &quot; as ways to evaluate the schools ' success , maintains Ernest R . Leach , deputy chancellor of the California community_colleges . More worrisome , Leach said , is that the ongoing fiscal squeeze could jeopardize the schools ' &quot; open_door &quot; policy . Last year , for example , community_college enrollment fell by 132 # 000 students or 9 % , due_to fee increases and money-saving class reductions . Since 1991 , 15 # 000 classes , or about 10 % of all offerings , have been cut , according to the chancellor ' s office in Sacramento . PCC , for instance , has trimmed 31 teaching and administrative jobs in the last few years . &quot; It ' s reaching the point where we can ' t just ' back and fill ' anymore , &quot; said Jacobs , the ceramics instructor . Meanwhile , as planners look_for ways to meet students ' needs with limited cash , Linda Banks is doing her homework . By her own description , Banks , 38 , graduated high_school &quot; functionally illiterate. &quot; Next came stints in the Army Reserve , a failed marriage , and a string of jobs such_as manager of an apartment complex . As try after try at community_college proved futile , she ultimately came_to see herself as stupid . Then came a profound discovery : PCC counselors told her she had dyslexia , a reading disorder . They also showed her new ways to study , such_as by reading along with books recorded on tape . They linked her up with a volunteer mentor on the counseling staff , &quot; someone who takes the time to hear me. &quot; Now , after all_the false starts , a miracle seemingly beckons : Banks is_on course to get her associate of arts degree next year and pursue her goal of studying hotel management at Cal Poly Pomona . But her dreams don ' t end as a mere employee toiling for somebody else . At PCC she has had a glimpse into a new_world of possibilities , and she is aiming high . The plan is not &quot; to manage a hotel , &quot; Banks explains firmly . &quot; It ' s to own one. &quot; State of the State * Missed previous stories in the &quot; State of the State &quot; series ? All five parts are available on TimesLink , the new on-line service . Details on_Times electronic services , B4 State of the State : Education REALITY SKILLS : About half of California adults lack the reading and mathematics skills demanded by modern society , according to a recent study by the U.S. Department_of_Education . EDUCATION : Despite the budget squeeze , the state ' s system of higher education and training remains enormous , with 1.3 million students attending California ' s community_colleges alone . ECONOMY : The precise link between worker skills and economic_growth remains in_dispute , but scholars agree that people without post-high school training face shrinking career options . RHETORIC KATHLEEN BROWN &quot; Schools , students and middle-class families have shouldered too_much of the pain from Pete Wilson ' s budgetary mismanagement . It ' s robbing our economic future , and our children will be the ones who have to pay. &quot; &quot; Today , at the exact moment when we most desperately need a smart work_force , our school_system is failing us and we are failing our school system. &quot; &quot; California ' s economic future is dependent_on preparing California workers for the high-skill , high-wage jobs that will form the foundation of our 21st-Century economy. &quot; PETE WILSON &quot; California ' s economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to our ability to ensure that our work_force is adequately prepared. &quot; &quot; Economic revitalization isn ' t just a business issue . It ' s an education issue . It ' s a children ' s issue . It ' s the California issue on which all others turn. &quot; &quot; We need to forge a new partnership between business and schools , a partnership which can bring private resources , internships and job training into the public classroom. &quot; PROPOSALS BROWN Freeze tuition for at least a year in the community_college and university systems . Create a school-to-work curriculum in high_schools , allowing students to choose between college preparation courses and workplace preparation or a combination of both . Consolidate the 23 employment and training_programs into one accessible system of work_force development , and develop training standards set by industry . WILSON Establish a comprehensive school-to-career system in California , helping students make the transition to private industry by revamping high_school programs , with input from the private sector . Develop an integrated employment and training system , after hearing recommendations of the state Job Training Coordinating Council in April , 1995 .</TEXT>
