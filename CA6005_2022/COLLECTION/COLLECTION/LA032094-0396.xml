   <HEADLINE> IBM ' S CORPORATE DIET INCLUDES REDUCING ITS EXCESS REAL_ESTATE ; DOWNSIZING : IN THE PAST THREE YEARS , THE COMPANY HAS VACATED NEARLY HALF ITS U.S. OFFICE SPACE TO HELP STANCH THE FLOW OF RED INK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lee Dayton was anxious . It was early 1993 , and IBM was bleeding red ink . Dayton , IBM ' s manager of real_estate , ordered his staff to slash expenses for office space . They quickly responded , moving four employees into one wastefully big office . His . &quot; I told my team that we ' d better make an example of ourselves , &quot; the manager recalled , grinning . &quot; They came_up with a plan which required me to evict myself. &quot; Dayton ' s transfer to a smaller office in Stamford , Conn. , was symptomatic_of a change that is reshaping IBM and parts of corporate America . In the past three years , International Business Machines Corp . has vacated nearly half its U.S. office space -- 21 million square_feet . How much is that ? Picture all_the office space in downtown Pittsburgh , Seattle or Phoenix -- empty . It ' s like casting_off nine Empire_State Buildings , or three Pentagons . The shrinkage , of course , reflects IBM ' s particularly sharp decline in the highly competitive , DOS-eat-DOS era of personal_computers . IBM has shed one-third of its U.S. employees in the past three years . But IBM is not alone . Now that companies have &quot; downsized &quot; their staffs , many are looking_to do the same to their office_buildings . For example , Dayton ' s group , in addition to pruning IBM ' s space , has done consulting work for American Express Co . and KPMG Peat Marwick on cutting their office space . Corporate giants from AT &amp; T to Aetna have embarked_on space-reduction programs . In a recent Arthur Andersen &amp; Co . survey , nearly two-thirds of 700 corporate_executives said they had recently shrunk their office space , or planned to . &quot; Over the last three years , they ( companies ) have been shedding workers like crazy . That has caused them to reassess how much space they need , &quot; said William Wheaton , director of the center for real_estate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Some firms , he noted , have gone so far as_to &quot; re-engineer the work space -- so they need less space per worker. &quot; With corporate behemoths shedding offices like old skins , you might expect a further decline for the depressed U.S. commercial real_estate industry . Analysts say that ' s unlikely , since smaller , growing businesses are moving_into the empty space . But some cities have been hit badly . Take White Plains , 25 miles north of New York City , where IBM has vacated five buildings . A thriving corporate center in the mid- ' 80s , it ' s now dotted with silent glass-and-concrete shells . More_than one-fourth of its office space is empty , one of the highest rates in the nation , says ONCOR International , a real-estate services_firm . That has hurt both the city ' s tax_base and the electricians , plumbers and other workers who catered to the gleaming office complexes . &quot; You can ' t even give_away space , &quot; lamented Mayor Sy Schulman . &quot; They don ' t need it. &quot; IBM ' s case is striking because of the amount of space it ' s shedding and its attempt to go beyond merely disposing_of offices occupied by departing workers . It ' s trying to squeeze every penny out of its real_estate , in what Dayton calls &quot; a fundamental change in thinking. &quot; &quot; You have to very matter-of-factly explain that having a private office or a given office size is not an entitlement , &quot; he said . At IBM , rank used to have its privileges . Ask Linda Bodden . In the old days , the 34-year-old branch manager would have had a personal &quot; branch manager ' s secretary. &quot; There was a &quot; branch manager ' s desk &quot; -- &quot; bigger than a marketing manager ' s desk , &quot; she said . &quot; To be a branch manager in the old days was to get the big corner office , &quot; she said . &quot; That was a big deal. &quot; These days , Bodden works_out of clients ' offices , assisted by a car phone , beeper and a laptop_computer . When she checks_into the Cranford , N.J. , IBM office every two weeks , she shares a small cubicle in an open space . It was , she said , a &quot; cultural change. &quot; Perhaps a more important change affected desk-bound employees . These days , many IBM workers are doubling_up in offices . They ' re sacrificing classrooms and meeting rooms . Some conference_rooms , once idle , now see more traffic than a New York tanning salon in January . IBM motivated managers to give_up space by allowing them to &quot; transfer &quot; it -- on paper -- to IBM ' s real-estate department . The managers could then subtract the rental cost from their tight budgets . Like a giant jigsaw_puzzle , the vacated offices were put_together in some buildings . Employees were consolidated in others . Rick Bause , a 42-year-old public relations executive , was one of 400 employees moved from four locations into IBM ' s sprawling gray-and-blue building in White Plains . He went from a private office to sharing a slightly bigger one . &quot; To me , it ' s not a big deal , &quot; he said . Not everyone agrees . But one IBMer , speaking privately , said there were few complaints from employees : &quot; They ' re happy to have jobs. &quot; The problem now is disposing_of the emptied office space , most of which is leased . IBM has gotten_rid_of about 5 million of the 21 million emptied square_feet , and subleased another 3 million , Dayton said . Some local real-estate professionals believe IBM may eventually go so far as_to sell its hilltop headquarters in Armonk , N.Y. For now , though , the company says it has no plans to do so . In fact , it ' s moving more employees into the building . Some real_estate analysts note that companies typically cut office space during a recession , and expand when the economy grows . What is new , Dayton said , is the intense global competition that has forced companies to scrutinize every expense . &quot; A couple of years ago I would have been somewhat skeptical whether this would last , &quot; Dayton said . Now , he said , &quot; In IBM and other companies I talk to , it ' s permanent. &quot;</TEXT>
