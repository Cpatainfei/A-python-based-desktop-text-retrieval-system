   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; RACIST ' MAIL BOMB ' MESSAGE HITS 20 # 000 COMPUTER USERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 20 # 000 computer users across the country received an electronic &quot; mail bomb &quot; Monday when someone apparently broke_into a Texas college professor ' s Internet account and fired off a racist message to addresses culled from several sites on the global network . The incident -- which brought death threats and other angry responses from hundreds of recipients who thought it came from Grady Blount , a professor of environmental_science at Texas A &amp; M University in Corpus Christi -- reflects the vulnerability to intrusion of many computer_systems on the network . It also underscores the fragility of the emerging social_system on the electronic frontier , where the much-touted cheapness and simplicity of distributing information can be easily abused . Unsolicited mass mailings , whether from stolen or legitimate accounts , are not hard to orchestrate . &quot; The potential for this kind of thing is the price you pay_for the relative inexpensiveness of the Internet , &quot; said Jeff Olenchek , a University of Wisconsin system administrator whose network was compromised in the break-in . &quot; You pay your initial fee but it ' s free to send an e-mail message. &quot; Internet users at college campuses in Mississippi and Colorado were also affected . Netcom , a San Jose-based Internet service provider , estimates that about 3 # 000 of its subscribers received the mail , which was signed &quot; Crusader &quot; and included the phone_number of the white_supremacist National Alliance . &quot; And if you burn_down your own neighborhood when a court decision doesn ' t go your way , don ' t worry : Truckloads of money will soon arrive to build you new breeding colonies -- er , I mean houses , apartments , community_centers , swimming_pools , etc. , &quot; the message read in part .</TEXT>
