   <TEXT> Edison Signs More Side Deals With Power Generators : Southern California Edison Co . said it has negotiated options to buy electricity from three more of the independent energy producers that previously won power-purchase contracts from Edison under an auction mandated by the California Public_Utilities Commission . Edison , which is contesting the auction , has long contended that it does not need the new power , which it estimates would cost ratepayers $ 200 million to $ 300 million more a year.Edison signed a similar deal last month with Kenetech Corp. , a windmill energy producer . Wednesday ' s deal with U.S. Generating Co . -- an independent power producer owned by subsidiaries of Bechtel Group Inc. and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . -- is for an option to buy 372 megawatts of power . Edison also said it has bought_out the auction contracts won by two smaller producers -- BTI Chino , a biomass energy company , and Mammoth Pacific , a geothermal producer . Edison wants the PUC to accept these deals in place of the 30-year auction contracts that would force it to buy power .</TEXT>
