   <HEADLINE> GIRL SUSPENDED FOR CONDOM DISPLAY FILES SUIT ; COURTS : ACLU CHARGES THAT SCHOOL VIOLATED RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH . DISTRICT SAYS HER ACTIONS WERE INAPPROPRIATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fourteen-year-old Astrianna Johnson said she was so concerned about friends who have gotten pregnant , and the spread of the deadly AIDS virus that she wanted to make a bold statement about the importance of safe_sex : She pinned condom packs to her shoes and clothes at school . Her campaign got Astrianna suspended from school last fall after the principal at Bethune Middle_School in South-Central Los Angeles said the eighth-grader was not old enough to make statements about sex , according to a lawsuit filed_in Los Angeles Superior_Court on Friday against the Los Angeles Unified School District . Astrianna , who says her right to free speech has been violated , said in an interview Friday that administrators &quot; should face the fact &quot; that teen-agers her age are having_sex and that her school should provide better sex education and AIDS awareness instruction . &quot; When my friends started having babies , when they started having_sex without protection , that ' s when I decided to start wearing them ( condoms ) , &quot; said the girl , who is back in school and has ceased wearing the packets until the case is settled . The lawsuit , filed by the American Civil Liberties Union , seeks to allow Astrianna to wear the sealed condom packages in class with &quot; safe_sex &quot; written_on them as a means to increase student awareness . In the past , Astrianna had worn up_to five packages on her shoes , jacket lapel and her upper right pant_leg , court documents said . In addition to the school district , the lawsuit names Principal Edith H . Morris and Assistant Principal Lucreisa Sturns . Morris declined to comment . School district spokesman Bill Rivera said the district administration supports the principal ' s decision to order the girl to remove the condoms and suspend her for one day . &quot; School administrators felt it was inappropriate , &quot; Rivera said , adding that the girl had displayed one condom in her crotch area . &quot; Sometimes there is a greater right -- that her actions might lead to disrupting other students -- and school administration has to take appropriate steps to make_sure that doesn ' t happen. &quot; Amos Dyson , the girl ' s ACLU attorney , denied that Astrianna ever wore a condom on her crotch . Astrianna said : &quot; There really wasn ' t a lot of reaction from my friends . It didn ' t disturb anyone . They just asked me why I was wearing them . I said if they are going_to have_sex , they have to be safe and use protection. &quot; According to the lawsuit , Sturns told Astrianna to remove condoms from her shoe because it conflicted with school policy that promotes student sexual abstinence . After she came_to school again with condoms on her shoes and pants , the girl ' s mother , Sundra Johnson , was called_in . Morris said that although displaying condoms was &quot; not clearly prohibited under the school rules , &quot; it was &quot; distasteful to the administration . . . on the list of dangerous things , &quot; court records said . Sundra Johnson disagreed . When her daughter told the principal she had a right to wear the packages and would continue to do so , Astrianna was suspended . &quot; I believe my daughter has a right to express herself and that she is not too young to make a statement like this , &quot; Sundra Johnson said . &quot; We have had discussions together about sex and when she has questions she knows she can come_to me . If I don ' t have the answer , we will find_out together. &quot; Dyson said that Astrianna is expressing her views &quot; in a very discreet and subtle way . . . . This was not a circus-like thing . She didn ' t look_like a clown. &quot; The district ' s health curriculum encompasses a broad range of issues . Middle and high_school students , who must obtain parental permission , receive about 20 hours of sex education that includes instruction on AIDS awareness , sexually transmitted diseases , safe_sex and abstinence , said Claudia Baker , who prepares the programs . Condoms are available to students at all high_schools with parental permission . Only 3 % of parents districtwide refuse to allow their children to attend sex education classes , Baker said .</TEXT>
