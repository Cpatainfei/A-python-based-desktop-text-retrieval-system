   <HEADLINE> MEN MUST ENGENDER GREATER INDIVIDUALITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Uncarnal Knowledge &quot; ( May 2 ) : Human_beings are many things . They are their profession , their political_party , their gender , their citizenry , their ancestry , their religion , someone ' s spouse , someone ' s child . The list goes_on and on . It is unfortunate that men identify themselves first and foremost , if not completely , with their gender . It seems to me that is why men find it hard to have friendships with women . Their gender overshadows their individuality . A male encounters another male -- competition ; a male encounters a female -- sexual tension . We are individuals , and individuality should be the first thing we identify ourselves with . If we could put our gender second or third , I think our society would be a little less sex-mad and a little less uptight overall . KATHERINE CHILJAN Northridge</TEXT>
