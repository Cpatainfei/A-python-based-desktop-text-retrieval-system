   <TEXT> A July 12 article described the use of computers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory &quot; to store and distribute hard-core pornography. &quot; It is unfortunate that many Americans still have not recognized that the work of the nuclear_weapons labs in designing , testing and improving nuclear_weapons is an even more serious form of pornography . What could be more obscene than developing weapons that melt eyeballs , cook flesh and incinerate human_beings -- weapons of mass_murder that place the entire human species in danger of annihilation ?
