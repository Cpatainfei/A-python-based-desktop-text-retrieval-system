   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DOCUMENT SEIZURE PUTS D.A. ON CENTER COURT ; INQUIRY : CAPIZZI WAITED TWO WEEKS TO ENTER O.C. FRAY . SOME LAUD HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH ; OTHERS QUESTION DELAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The decision by Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi -- who has maintained a decidedly low profile for the past two weeks -- to seize a vanload of documents from the county Monday moves his office abruptly from the sidelines onto center court in the bankruptcy disaster . Many in legal and political circles had been waiting to see how Capizzi , a man who built his reputation pursuing public corruption , would weigh in on the controversy . &quot; This whole_thing is a political minefield . But it ' s an area in which Mike Capizzi has an incredible amount of acumen . He ' s smart , and he ' s moved to stake out his position -- once he decided that it would n ' t be political suicide , &quot; said William J . Kopeny , a veteran defense_attorney and former public_defender . But for some critics , Monday ' s move was too late in coming . &quot; We ' re into our third week in this now , and where has the D.A. been ? &quot; asked Mark P . Petracca , an associate_professor of political_science at UC Irvine . &quot; One might have imagined he would have ( taken a more aggressive role ) right away. &quot; Since the county declared bankruptcy Dec . 6 , Capizzi ' s office has stayed clear of the fray , refusing to acknowledge whether it was investigating the_matter . Even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and at least three other agencies launched formal probes , Orange County prosecutors insisted they were merely &quot; reviewing &quot; the situation . Investigators did speak last week with several financial_officers from around the county , but Robert Cornelius , assistant superintendent for business services for the Saddleback Valley Unified School District , said the interview was brief and the district_attorney ' s representative was &quot; kind of apologetic for stopping by and checking with us. &quot; But that low-key approach turned aggressive Monday , as district_attorney ' s officials spent most of the day executing search_warrants at the offices of the Orange County treasurer and the auditor-controller , seeking documents that might reveal whether the nation ' s biggest municipal bankruptcy entailed any criminal wrongdoing . While his investigators worked behind a yellow tape cordon at county offices a block away , Capizzi maintained his conservative posture , declining to provide details on the scope or aim of his investigation as he fielded questions at a hastily called afternoon news_conference . &quot; It ' s not our custom or practice to provide road maps &quot; for where investigations are going , he said . &quot; We ' re not confining our focus to any particular ( area of the law ) . . . . We ' re analyzing all aspects of this matter. &quot; Capizzi made his mark as a deputy district_attorney in the 1970s in the prosecution of more_than three dozen Orange County political corruption cases . With that experience behind him , Kopeny said he believes the district_attorney realized the need to assess the potential legal and political fallout from a high-profile case before rushing in . But Capizzi obviously concluded that the gains outweigh the risks . &quot; He ' s decided not to let anyone -- the Feds or the state -- take_over the high ground from him , &quot; he said . Said Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder : &quot; It ' s important for all concerned to get_to the bottom of everything . If it takes a search_warrant to do_it , then so be it . If the treasurer and auditor didn ' t do anything wrong , they shouldn ' t feel bothered by this. &quot; Observers said a successful prosecution in the internationally known case could provide a much-needed boost in public relations for the district_attorney ' s office , which has suffered a string of recent setbacks . Most prominent was the decision this fall to file and then drop charges against a suspect in the Laguna Beach fires who turned_out to have been in a Mexican jail at the time . But there may be political risks for Capizzi as well , since Monday ' s search_warrants have already caused signs of friction among some of his colleagues . Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley appeared frustrated to see yet another agency taking an active role in the bankruptcy . And one top county official who asked not to be identified grumbled aloud over why Capizzi wanted copies Monday of a 1993 audit that was critical of Citron ' s management practices . County supervisors have been pilloried for not acting_on the audit , but the official said : &quot; He got that report too , and he didn ' t do anything . You ' ve got_to ask the question , why now ? &quot; UCI ' s Petracca maintained that such tensions can color a sensitive investigation because the district_attorney ' s office falls_under county jurisdiction and must work with other branches of government on budget and management issues . That may explain , Petracca contended , why the district_attorney often allows other agencies to take the lead public role in corruption cases such_as the influence-peddling investigation of former Supervisor Don R . Roth . The FBI moved_out front publicly at the beginning of the case , but the district_attorney ultimately convicted Roth on seven ethics violations . In the bankruptcy case , the SEC ' s probe was promptly followed by others launched by the Justice_Department , the state_Department of Corporations and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , before Capizzi announced his own investigation . &quot; This is really the district_attorneys ' ( modus_operandi ) in Orange County . . . to wait until some_other agency steps_in before going_after it themselves , &quot; Petracca said . &quot; But this is a pretty big event -- they don ' t get much bigger . . . . So eventually , you look a little silly in the eyes of a public that ' s angry as hell if you don ' t do anything about it. &quot;</TEXT>
