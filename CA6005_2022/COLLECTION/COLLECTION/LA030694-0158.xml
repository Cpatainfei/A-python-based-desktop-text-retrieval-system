   <TEXT> As everyday baseball resumes this spring and as the basketball_season begins to wind down , one thing is evident : On the popularity meter , these are sports heading in different directions . Basketball is gaining everywhere . Baseball , the undisputed national pastime 30 or 40 years ago , has lost its grip on the country . Nationwide polls , television ratings , and other indicators make the critical_points : * Although pro football is America ' s most popular spectator game , the public ' s interest in basketball on all other fronts -- college , prep and playground -- is either comparable_with football ' s or ahead . * Although attendance remains high for major_league baseball -- identifying the game ' s loyal but aging fan base -- support for baseball has been declining in the country at_large . * The college basketball championship game has moved ahead of the World_Series and become the nation ' s second-biggest annual sports attraction . In the most recent television ratings , the NCAA title game ' s 22.2 was exceeded only by the Super Bowl ' s 45.5. Since 1980 , the average annual World_Series TV rating has tumbled 47 % to last fall ' s 17.3. By contrast , the NBA finals were up_to a 17.9 average last spring , when college basketball ' s Final Four games averaged 17.0. It shouldn ' t be supposed , though , that as a game , baseball has deteriorated . This is still the same superb game it was in the years before television , before radio , before telephones . What has changed is the America that created baseball a century and a half ago . Today , basketball is in tune with the times . * This is an era of information overload , instant gratification and shortened attention_spans . This , to use a TV phrase , is the sound-bite era . And , contributing to the restive collective consciousness , basketball offers the quickness of movement and the repetitive , almost continuous , scoring that so strongly appeal_to the sound-bite generation . Baseball , once the obvious leader , is losing ground not because of its defects , real or imagined , but because 1990s Americans want something livelier , more modern , more pertinent . And that ' s basketball . This is a country always in evolution , and its history , in large part , is a history of a quickening of pace . In the slow , hard days before electric_lights and indoor plumbing , the symbol of early America was the horse . Nothing moved faster than a horse could run . The pace picked_up with the coming of electric , steam and oil power to a more active generation , and the symbol of that somewhat hastier time was a baseball . In those years , nothing moved faster than a ball could be hit with a bat , and baseball suitably became the national pastime . But that era , too , was doomed . With fiber optics and computer_science and dunked basketballs , the pace has quickened again , and the symbol of this new age is the sound_bite . Time appears to be instantaneous on living-color television . The evening news can acquaint the entire country with the latest war reports , or more often the latest scandals , in eight or 10 seconds , more or less . And in doing so , TV people have found that that ' s all that Americans want to hear about anything , anyway , unless an ice skater has been assaulted . As President Clinton recently said , &quot; It ' s hard to get more_than one message a day across to the American people. &quot; If in such a country basketball is a better fit than baseball , the fit wasn ' t planned , it just happened , evolving out of the nature of basketball -- which not too long ago was a slow-moving sport with final scores of 28-27 and 32-30 . It has become a 104-102 sport because , for one thing , most of the nation ' s finest athletes are now in the NBA . &quot; I ' d have gone_for pro basketball if I were taller , &quot; Kansas City Chief quarterback Joe Montana said , expressing a view often made by professionals in all sports . &quot; Basketball was my favorite game in school. &quot; Many nonprofessionals , who play neighborhood and playground basketball all_over America , agree with the pros . &quot; Basketball has such deep roots , &quot; former coach Red Auerbach once said . &quot; It ' s a team game that two people can play . In fact , it ' s a team game that one guy can play by himself. &quot; As a spectator sport , it also differs considerably from the others . On a typical winter night , in an interval of three or four seconds , you can watch the athletic 7-footers of the NBA make -- in one play -- a sequence of six or seven seemingly impossible moves , followed by somebody ' s sudden shot . The shot drops_in more often than not , starting a race to the other end of the court and , perhaps , a dunk , followed by another race and another basket and another race in a long , exciting melange of sound_bites . There are no home_run trots , no balks , no huddles . And it is the constant commotion that holds the attention of today ' s shouting sports fans , who have to think fast to keep_up with it all . Their thoughts wandered last fall when a baseball_player , Lenny Dykstra , in one of the big events of the sports year , took_five consecutive pitches_in a typically slow-moving playoff_game -- never moving his bat from his shoulder . Most end-of-the-century Americans don ' t have the time or patience to sit through the baseball playoffs . And so that night they missed one of the great athletic moments of our time . * The only thing that can speed_up baseball is the 11 o ' clock news . Between commercials , an entire World_Series game can be staged in one sound_bite without missing a significant pitch or base_hit . But that , of course , isn ' t the game that baseball fans love . Theirs , they insist , is a sport without flaws . As aspiring baseball_player Michael Jordan said last year when he was still playing basketball : &quot; I don ' t think baseball has done anything wrong . I think a new generation grew_up with the NBA. &quot; Still very much in place are all_the aspects of baseball that made_it the national pastime early in the 1900s . As presented on warm summer evenings -- or even on cold nights in California -- baseball is still a pastoral game of precision , pageantry and a pleasing simplicity that masks often picturesque complexity . As a television_program , though , it doesn ' t adapt as well as basketball does or as football can with its avalanche of violent plays and instant replays . So the best way to see a baseball_game is to sit quietly in the stands , using binoculars now and then to focus_on the batter , the pitcher , or the managers -- who can always be out-guessed -- or on such details as the changing alignments of the defensive teams . With almost every pitch , one or more infielders will shift left or right , move_in or out , and one or more outfielders will move a step or two or more . For , if the score is close , every pitch begins a new ballgame , and any pitch can be decisive . Baseball , as its fans say , is a game of expectations . What doesn ' t happen can be as interesting as what does . And the game moves with such deliberate speed that every spectator has an opportunity to live_in the minds of the principals -- the players and their managers -- and to think along with them pitch to pitch , out_to out , inning to inning . &quot; For most clubs , the object is to get a runner to second_base , &quot; Oakland A ' s Manager Tony LaRussa said . Once he ' s there , can the hitter get him home ? Can he do_it if he falls_behind , and 2 ? Can he do_it if he works the count to 3 and 1 ? It ' s a team game without a goal_line to defend -- that is a baseball oddity -- but it ' s a team game only nominally . The essence of baseball is pitcher vs . hitter : the mind games of man vs . man . No other sport except boxing is so conspicuously man to man . * Dykstra personified the timeless nature of the sport last October when a National League playoff_game was poking along as usual . Tenth inning , score even , 3-3 , series even , 2-2 . Coming_to bat for the Philadelphia Phillies -- slowly -- Dykstra finally stepped_in and took a strike . Then he took a ball . Then another ball . Then he took Strike 2 . Then Ball 3 . Five pitches -- and Dykstra ' s bat was still on his shoulder . Was anything happening ? Is there any drama when a good hitter just stands there looking_at the pitches ? It all depends . It depends_on whether the viewer realizes -- or cares -- that in that spot , Dykstra , a singles hitter normally , is working the count for his home_run pitch -- an inside fastball up in the strike zone . &quot; I think he would have fouled off three or four if he ' d had to , &quot; said Steve Moyer of Chicago ' s Stats , Inc. Instead , the sixth pitch was Dykstra ' s . And since the home_run he hit that time had been planned and deliberately executed , it could be recognized immediately for what it was -- one of the most difficult feats in all_of team sports . It was also the turning point in a series that ended the season for the Atlanta Braves . For those who had the time to wait for it , that was a moment . * Few things more clearly define the difference between baseball and basketball than what happens after the final play : * When the game is over and the crowd leaves the arena , basketball fans find it hard to remember what went_on , precisely . They know who won , but the rest is often a blur . * By contrast , baseball fans , on their way home , or when they get there , can reconstruct the whole game in their minds . A mental exercise of that sort is a distinct plus to baseball fans , as well as_to football fans and golfers , who frequently replay their games , too . But it ' s all irrelevant to basketball fans . Their most recent game is a jot in history . Who wants to give it another thought ? After the last dunk every night , basketball fans are instantly ready for another show . The polls show that most baseball fans are over 50 . Basketball fans tend to be much younger -- and it could be that their world was shaped by , of all things , TV commercials . The sound-bite era began , some believe , with television ' s modern commercial_messages , whose producers wished to cram a lot of information into a_few seconds . Thus they started cutting quickly from this to that , and learned , in the process , that the optimum way to sell a complex message is with quick bites . Among those viewing the earliest action commercials were the producers of TV news_shows and movies , some of whom soon made movies that way , too , telling their simple stories with sequences of quick visual_images . And that ' s what killed old movies : Not just the sex and violence and color but also the modern pace . Video_games and MTV are likewise filled with rapidly changing images , and hence are more likely to appeal_to younger sports fans . And , quite possibly , such activities have made basketball fans mentally more alert than the Americans of 50 years ago . They simply think faster -- or at least process visual information faster -- than grandpa used to . It ought not to come as a surprise , in any event , that today ' s sports fans , nourished on the action of the new commercials , the new movies , MTV and the_like , and hammered by the continuous sound_bites of television ' s news_shows , should feel right at_home at a basketball_game . And out_of_place in a ballpark . The idea of settling_down and getting more deeply involved in something that is just a game is foreign to the sound-bite generation . But not to baseball fans , who , in a relaxed ballpark setting , still enjoy matching wits with a manager who can ' t decide whether to change pitchers now or five minutes from now . After the next pitch . Clearly , the swiftness of the game makes basketball more congenial than baseball to the modern mind . But it doesn ' t make_it better . The rarest individual in the sports world today is the man who can get three base_hits in 10 major_league at-bats . Who in the NBA can ' t dunk a basketball ?</TEXT>
