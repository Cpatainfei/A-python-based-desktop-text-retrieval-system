   <HEADLINE> ISLAMIC TROOPS TO THE RESCUE ? ; THE FRENCH PROPOSAL COULD DISGUISE THE ROUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Monday , French Defense Minister Francois Leotard , joined by U.S. Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry , called Monday for a strengthened NATO defense of U.N. operations in Bosnia , contradicting a position in favor of U.N. withdrawal taken just last week by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe . However , the measures Leotard and Perry mentioned in their Washington press_conference -- concentrating the U.N. forces in just a_few places , opening a well-defended corridor to the Adriatic and changing the rules of engagement -- may only be disguised preparation for a Bosnian Dunkirk . The British are reportedly cool to the proposal , though nothing proposed Monday would prevent U.N. officials and Sir Michael Rose , who commands U.N. peacekeepers , from barring , as they have hitherto , any inconvenient NATO action . By contrast , the Organization of the Islamic Conference , meeting in Morocco , has declared the readiness of its members not just to replace European U.N. troops but to do so even if the U.N. arms embargo is lifted , a measure the Europeans have argued would endanger U.N. forces . That suggestion attracted notice in France , which is in the middle of an electoral season . Perhaps the embarrassment of a precipitous French departure from Bosnia followed by the arrival of Islamic troops on European soil may have dictated a delay of the debacle . At this confusing juncture the American policy options remain , in declining order of preferability ( not probability ) : 1 ) Lift and strike : Lift the U.N. arms embargo against Bosnia and use NATO air strikes to support ground defense by Bosnia ' s own troops . This is the option that President Bill_Clinton favored as he came_into office and what the Republican majority_leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives still favor . 2 ) Defense of the U.N. forces . If Leotard ' s proposal is not a Dunkirk disguise , here is where it could count . The United States has nothing to lose by taking the proposal at face_value . Even an orderly retreat , as opposed to a humiliating rout , may save U.N. lives now and U.N. credibility later . 3 ) Evacuation of the U.N. forces . If Leotard ' s proposal is rejected by NATO ( in which every member state has a veto ) or frustrated by a U.N. commander too fearful of -- or favorable toward -- the Serbs to risk actively defending his own forces , then the humiliation of those forces will continue and will end only in potentially chaotic evacuation . At that point , whatever the domestic grumbling , the United States should assist in an expeditious evacuation . Effectively , these remain the U.S. options even in the wake of a peace proposal Wednesday by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic . A declaration of victory more_than a peace proposal , Karadzic ' s offer is likely to be rejected by the Bosnian government but welcomed by a United Nations that at this point may want only a safe exit . For now , the OIC countries want their forces to work as a part of UNPROFOR . Under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter , however , they may also come_to Bosnia ' s defense directly , without U.N. approval . Short of intervention , rumors are rife of a unilateral OIC lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia . If the OIC attempts to land troops or deliver arms to Bosnia by sea , will the_French and British now patrolling the Dalmatian coast try to stop them ? Will the world see a Christian-Muslim naval war in the Adriatic ? Scarcely . Yet if the OIC action turns_into measurable support for Bosnia , the Europeans may discover that by refusing to defend this Muslim-dominated European state they have succeeded only in enlarging the Muslim presence on their continent . With the OIC in the background , a NATO evacuation of the U.N. forces acquires a meaning that otherwise it would not have . The Balkans War may be evolving before our eyes into a world_war in miniature .</TEXT>
