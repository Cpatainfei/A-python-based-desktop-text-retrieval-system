   <TEXT> The myth of the West is of a frontier pounded into submission by rugged_individualism . Southern Californians , according to more modern mythology , are the nation ' s social tumbleweeds , stampeded west by a solipsistic lust for wealth and fame and a loathing of the claustrophobia of small-town America . Both myths are truthful in part . ATMs , freeways , drive-throughs and drive-bys all attest to many Angelenos ' fidgety aversion to direct human contact . But individuals here have never been entirely autonomous . Cults are as Californian as the car culture , for instance . And by the 1992 riot , it was all_the rage for people to band into aggrieved interest_groups . The &quot; African American community &quot; and &quot; Korean American community &quot; soon found themselves elbowed by the &quot; surfer community &quot; and the &quot; tattooed community. &quot; Balkanized became the region ' s latest defining cliche . Then , at 4:31 one morning , Southern California ' s alarm_clocks went_off in unison , so to speak . Now a lot of people want to hang onto the feeling of connectedness that came_with instant membership in the community of quake survivors . There are plenty of reasons to think that ' s a good idea . &quot; All over America , people are in deep doubt about the culture of the individual , &quot; says social theorist Michael Lerner , whose writings have shaped the Clinton_Administration ' s &quot; politics of meaning &quot; spiel . &quot; The healthy human being is the one who can recognize his or her need for other human_beings , our mutual dependency. &quot; Columnist George Will has observed in America &quot; a yearning for the community feeling that comes from collective undertakings . . . . The question is whether any enterprise other_than war can tap that yearning. &quot; Southern California may have provided an answer on Jan . 17 . It would be silly to tell Sweet Alice Harris of Watts , the folks at All Saints Episcopal in Pasadena , or other Californians who -- myths be damned -- have long cherished their connectedness , that this thing so facilely called &quot; community &quot; is a hip new trend . But these days institutions from the Catholic_Church to author Amitai Etzioni ' s &quot; communitarian &quot; movement are rethinking and experimenting with the concept . Traditional community and the extended_family began to erode with the industrial_revolution as factories and offices lured people who had once worked side_by_side on the farm or in the home , says futurist Alvin Toffler . As the power of family and community diminished , their traditional functions , from child_care to health_care for the elderly , gravitated to the state . Now Toffler has hope that the emerging interactive media and access to the information highway will reverse the work of two centuries , allowing parents to work_at home again and making_it possible for so-called bedroom &quot; communities &quot; to become more neighborly . Even the most cohesive community , though , can send repercussions through the region that surrounds it . When well-meaning people in the Valley organize to oppose a light rail project through their turf , they might also consider the stunningly low lung capacity of children in such communities as Compton , Boyle Heights and Hancock Park and acknowledge that automobile emissions are the likely cause . Urban life is an intricate web of rights and responsibilities between rich and homeless , Vietnamese and Armenian , supplier and demander . . . . Unless the us-and-them boundaries of community break_down , riots will remain as inevitable as earthquakes . In heaps of broken china , though , is hope . True community , argues Lois Arkin , who is helping to create an &quot; eco-village &quot; in the central_city , makes people question their priorities at a fundamental level -- makes them notice , she says , the distinction between &quot; standard_of_living &quot; and &quot; quality of life. &quot; The first term , Arkin says , &quot; has to do with your relationship to your material level of comfort , goodies . . . . Quality_of_life has to do with your relationship to people and to the environment . . . . When people think_about community , they think_about how we care_for one another. &quot; And , Arkin adds , the burden on government drops_in direct relation_to that caring . Building community isn ' t easy though . It ' s not all pancake breakfasts and uplifting chat with like-minded neighbors . Community also means , it has been said , tolerating &quot; bores , boors , and people who smell bad. &quot; So , how far can we go_in foisting community upon individuals already juggling demands of work , home and chores and at_the_same_time searching for some sense of oasis in an increasingly crowded place ? The question becomes not how we reconstitute an old-fashioned goldfish bowl of a neighborhood but how we define and make a new community in which the spaces between people are as important as the places where they choose to gather . Years ago , author Kurt Vonnegut Jr . suggested that America ' s sense of existential loneliness might be cured by the creation of artificial extended families . Similar radical steps for building community may now be in_order , he suggests . &quot; Not only Los Angeles but most American cities , &quot; he says , &quot; should be thinking now of what they ought to have been instead of what they allowed themselves to become. &quot; BOB SIPCHEN and CARLA HALL</TEXT>
