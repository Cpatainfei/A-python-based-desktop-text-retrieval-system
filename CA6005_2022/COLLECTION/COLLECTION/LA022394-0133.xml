   <HEADLINE> ' THIS TOO SHALL PASS ' ; SISTER MARIE MADELEINE SHONKA , CHIEF OF ST . JOHN ' S , LOOKS_AT THE CENTER ' S FUTURE AND AT LIFE AFTER THE QUAKE -- WHEN SHE LOST HER JOB , HOSPITAL , HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka , president and chief_executive_officer of St . John ' s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica , is taking_stock these days after the Northridge quake closed St . John ' s . Gone are her hospital and its 1 # 750 employees , gone are her home and her roommates . The 67-year-old Sister of Charity , a dead_ringer for the woman on the See ' s candy box , now lives_in a 2BD , 2BA apartment with her closest friend and senior assistant , Sister Alice Marie Schwieder . Sitting in their new environs with Frank Sinatra crooning &quot; Fly Me to the Moon &quot; over the radio , Shonka talked_about the tasks ahead . * Question : What will happen to St . John ' s Hospital ? Answer : St . John ' s will never be the same . It will be different . It will be better . The most dramatic thing will be razing the North Wing . This is an opportunity to prepare ourselves for the health_care of the next century . We ' ve known all along that there is an excess of hospital_beds in Southern California and that we did not need 501 beds . When we reopen the South Wing in August , we ' ll have about 150 inpatient beds . The volume of inpatients has decreased significantly and the volume of outpatients has increased . We are going_to work with Santa Monica Hospital so that both of us are meeting unmet community needs . Maybe we ' ll develop a medical-mall type of approach , where you have multiple , walk-in clinics with dentistry , inpatient beds , emergency activities and free-standing surgery centers . * Q : Do you think most health-care facilities are moving_in that general direction ? A : Outpatient is less costly and a more effective way of meeting public needs . When I first came here in 1968 , about 10 % of our surgery was outpatient . A patient would come_in the morning , have surgery and go_home at night . The rest of the surgeries , patients would stay five or 10 days . With the changes in health-care delivery , we are now finding that about 60 % of our surgery is done_in an outpatient capacity . We need to accommodate much fewer inpatients . Other hospitals will be in the same situation in the future , where they will have to look_at programs and services directed at the health-care revolution . * Q : What is motivating the movement toward outpatient care ? A : Doctors prefer it because it gives them a broader turnover of patients . It ' s more cost-effective . Many patients prefer it . Maybe the future patient is a working man who can ' t give_up a weekday to come_in_for surgery . Maybe there are options for him to come_in on Friday , recuperate over the weekend and get_back out on_the_job on Monday . I think , with the Clinton health plan , or whatever version comes_out of it , that people will stay healthier as we move_into preventive_medicine and we won ' t be looking_at long-term stays . We ' re a much healthier country now . Most people that came here in 1968 would come for maybe two or three days to get annual physicals . * Q : What is your view on Clinton ' s health-care plan as it stands now ? A : The goals , access and universal coverage are really very important . The challenges will be in looking_at how we can accommodate access and still have reimbursement that is projected to be much less . I am concerned about these alliances ( a concept of managed competition where regional alliances representing consumers would shop among competing insurance plans for the best deals and deliver report_cards to health plans , hospitals and doctors ) they are talking_about . I am concerned that it could become a bureaucratic maze . Price-fixing would be a very serious problem . It has not ever worked in any of our major industries . If everything were price-fixed that would be fine , but if a hospital is price-fixed in what it can charge , but the people outside and vendors are not , then it could inundate a hospital with red ink in a short period_of_time . * Q : How are you dealing with all these losses since the earthquake , including the severance of all these employees who considered St . John ' s a family ? A : I get emotional when I talk to my employees and say goodby after all those years . I have cried . And it really kind of tears you apart after awhile . But in all fairness to them , you really have to sever relationships so they can find jobs because it is just never going_to be the same . But the loss of the sisters is one of the most poignant things for me . It ' s lonesome . I always enjoyed seeing them at meals , and I miss that . It ' s like disrupting a family -- it kind of gets convulsed and it ' s going_to get more convulsed in the next few months . But this too shall pass . * Q : Some former St . John ' s employees have said that they feel betrayed because they say they were told that they would not get priority over other applicants for jobs when the facility reopens and because , initially , they were told that they would not retain seniority if rehired . A : We made a mistake with the seniority . But we heard the employees ' complaints and we made the adjustments . Now if an employee had 15 years ' seniority and they were gone_for ( up_to five years ) they could still come_back in at the 15-year level . Some of this is a misunderstanding or confusion or anger at things in_general and at life in particular . We have spent a lot of time , effort and energy to develop a cadre of employees that really represent St . John ' s . Why would I , at this point_in_time , go_out and bring_in total strangers to go_about our mission , our ministry and our work efforts ? We felt so compelled to give good severance packages because we know that nobody could be down from February to August , particularly when there are going_to be 1 # 000 less jobs now . It doesn ' t take a rocket scientist to see what the_devil has happened here with the hospital down . I really feel badly that so many were laid_off . But I didn ' t create the earthquake . I just didn ' t do_it . * Q : What has it been like living_in an apartment after having spent 45 years in a convent with a community of religious sisters ? You have a Betty Crocker cookbook on the coffee_table . What kind of cuisine is served_up at night ? A : The food was brought_up from the cafeteria every day ( when the convent was_on the hospital ' s sixth floor ) , so cooking , baking and shopping are things we have to deal with . I am abhorrent of shopping , for clothes or anything . And I just don ' t cook . I cooked our first meal here and Sister Alice Marie was_sick the next day . We decided to let her cook the meals . All I did was scramble eggs and bacon . I am hoping she got an illness from something else . But it has been different , challenging and lonesome . I lost my job , my hospital and my home all_in one day . This is where we live now . It ' s a nice , cute lovely apartment , but for me , the loss of the sisters was the most traumatic thing . I used to always have a Super Bowl party . I watched it in my new apartment , and there were only two of us to have my usual party with the chips , dips , popcorn and beer . My heart was with Buffalo , but my money was_on Dallas . I am a great , great sports fan . I ' ve always been like that . I was the only girl on the block in a little town of Chapel in western Nebraska and whatever the boys were playing , either football or basketball , they let me play because they knew it was OK for the guys to push me around and tackle me . And women , at that time , weren ' t the highest priority in Chapel and still aren ' t . But I have had a happy career as a sportsperson . * Q : Where do you think nuns are today in terms of the public perception , from the 1966 movie &quot; The Singing Nun &quot; to today ' s &quot; Sister Act 2 , &quot; and in the patriarchal power_structure of the church ? A : I enjoyed &quot; Sister Act , &quot; just the fun of it . I haven ' t seen the second one , but nuns are real live human_beings and we like to laugh , work and pray . We are products of our age . We are no longer isolated in a convent . Some dress in habit , some don ' t . We have far more exposure to all_the issues that people face . Although we don ' t face the same issues , simpatico and compassionately , we can really identify with their problems . The power_structure of the church is still predominantly male , but I think that the future of the church is recognized in the contribution of the many marvelous women who are committed as deeply as cardinals , bishops and priests to our faith and service . And I ' ve met people who simply don ' t like nuns . They can be very rude . I always laugh and say , &quot; I ' ll bet somebody rapped their knuckles with a ruler when they were in grade school. &quot; You just have to try and develop an individual relationship with them . * Q : Do you think sisters will ever say Mass , become priests or bishops ? A : Heard a joke about that one : The Pope was very ill . One night , he went_to_sleep and woke_up thinking he saw the heavenly Father there and he said , &quot; Oh , heavenly Father , do you think there will ever be married priests in the church ? &quot; And the heavenly Father said , &quot; No , not in your lifetime. &quot; The next night he had another vision , and he said , &quot; Oh , heavenly Father , do you think nuns will ever say Mass in the church ? &quot; And He said , &quot; No , not in your lifetime. &quot; And the next night , he had another vision and he said to the heavenly Father , &quot; Do you think that there will ever be another Polish pope in the church ? &quot; And He said , &quot; No , not in my lifetime. &quot; I love that joke . BACKGROUND The biggest task of Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka ' s 26-year career at St . John ' s Hospital and Medical_Center will be planning a St . John ' s for the 21st Century . Although the 52-year-old hospital now has outpatient services , inpatient won ' t be available until August and the immediate future calls_for demolition of the North Wing , home to the nursery , obstetric beds , a chemical-dependency unit , surgical-medical beds , a neonatal-intensive-care unit and a transitional-care unit . Shonka -- unbending as leader of the prominent hospital where she has collected 18 humanitarian awards and earned such endearments as &quot; the angel of St . John ' s &quot; and health-care visionary -- is dealing with the loss of 10 of her fellow Sisters of Charity . After the quake , they were called home to Leavenworth , Kan. , and reassigned . Her new apartment in Santa Monica , a far_cry from the convent at the hospital , marks the first time in 45 years that she has lived outside an institution .</TEXT>
