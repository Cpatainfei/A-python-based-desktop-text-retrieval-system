   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : CANINE SHOW A DELIGHT FOR DOG FANCIERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marilyn Donlon of Westlake and her golden_retriever , Lacey , stood_in the shade near Ring 18 on Sunday at the county ' s annual dog_show in Ventura , as Donlon primped and preened Lacey in anticipation of their turn_to enter the ring . Moments later , the judges called_for Donlon and the long-haired canine to begin . Lacey , with head held high , embarked_on a series of well-practiced walks , turns and jumps that Donlon hoped would result in a blue_ribbon for her 6-year-old companion . Afterward , Donlon rewarded Lacey with snacks and sips of cold water . But she doubted that the effort would be good_enough to take first place at the Ventura County Dog Fanciers Assn . Dog_Show concluding Sunday at the Ventura County Fairgrounds . Instead , she learned later , Lacey won a yellow ribbon for a third-place showing . &quot; She tried and that ' s what was most important , &quot; said Donlon , a professional dog trainer who won champion status with Lacey at an earlier meet . &quot; There are still some weaknesses , but she did a nice job. &quot; Lacey was one of more_than 2 # 300 dogs entered in a series of competitions at the fairgrounds in a weekend contest that attracted canines from all across the Western United States . &quot; People have to love animals to do this , and you have to love the competition , &quot; said William Bergum of Ventura , a director of the American Kennel Club , which sponsored the three-day show . &quot; Most people are here just for the joy of competing , &quot; he said . &quot; Nowadays , there are very few money prizes. &quot; Thousands of people streamed through the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Sunday to applaud the animals ' performances . Dogs competed in divisions of two primary categories that assess obedience and physical appearance . Divisional winners are presented ribbons that increase their value for breeding . Dogs competing for obedience ribbons must perform a routine that calls_for the animals to walk unleashed on long stretches of grass and sit at their owners ' commands . They must also fetch bones and hurdle a three-foot-high fence . Contestants in the conformation category , Bergum said , are judged strictly on physique and how closely they match a perfect computer-generated model . Tom Holstein , a Navy physicist who lives_in Oxnard , brought his 3-year-old golden_retriever , Trooper , to the show Sunday . But he didn ' t enter the young canine . &quot; He just hasn ' t been trained enough , &quot; Holstein said , watching the obedience contest near the fairgrounds entrance . &quot; I ' ll have him in the Lompoc show at the end of the month. &quot; JEFF McDONALD</TEXT>
