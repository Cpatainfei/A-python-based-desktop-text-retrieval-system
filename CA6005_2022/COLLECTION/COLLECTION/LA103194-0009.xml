   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 186 ; ' SINGLE PAYER ' IS A TONIC FOR PATIENTS ; THREATS OF LOST BENEFITS AND HIGH COSTS ARE AN INDUSTRY SMOKE_SCREEN . PROP . 186 OFFERS FULL COVERAGE AND SECURITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As I followed the national debate on health_care , I could not help but remember the hundreds of tragedies I ' ve come_across since I have been a physician : lack of access to proper care , financial ruin despite thousands spent on health premiums , insurance_companies that want to insure the healthy and desert the sick and who see patients as objects to manipulate to maximize profits , lack of peace_of_mind regarding our most precious commodity , our health . We have a chaotic health_insurance non-system that dictates everything , guarantees nothing and purposefully sacrifices people ' s health , financial security and peace_of_mind for financial_gain . And now the beneficiaries of this chaos are using every means possible to dissuade the public from passing Proposition 186 , the California Health Security Act . I have seen and lived what this proposition entails . I studied medicine at McGill University in Montreal where I experienced the single-payer system firsthand . Like most of my American colleagues who trained in Canada , I enthusiastically support single-payer universal coverage . As a physician , I may have been called a heretic just a_few years ago for promoting single-payer health_care . But the insurance_companies and &quot; mis &quot; managed-care firms have abused us and our patients . They have micromanaged our patient care and violated the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship . They have forced our large academic centers to compromise their educational and research missions in_order to compete with them . As a result , what was heresy has now gained legitimacy . In addition to the 1 # 000 physicians of the California Physicians Alliance who crafted the California Health Security Act , the California Medical Assn . admits that more_than 10 # 000 of its members favor a single-payer system . This trend among physicians is being progressively censored and suppressed by many hospital administrators who thrive on the current massive inefficiency . Proposition 186 ' s single-payer plan is a publicly financed , privately delivered , competitive health-care system that would provide legal California residents with a card enabling them to see the physician of their choice . The public would elect a health commissioner to administer the system , someone who is accountable to us and not to stockholders . The commissioner would be advised by a board of physicians and medical experts and would answer to consumer councils throughout the state . The health security act was carefully written and worded by physicians to preclude any micromanagement or intervention in the physician-patient relationship . The excellent benefits package would be available to all from cradle to grave . It could not be taken_away because of change in employment , disability , illness , divorce or anything else . Most of us would be very angry if the government we elected had to authorize our health_care before we received it ; yet we easily accept profit-motivated insurance_companies doing just that . It is time to reduce the 15 % -30 % insurance overhead ( and multimillion dollar CEO salaries ) our health premiums finance and replace it with the 2 % -4 % overhead seen in Medicare and single-payer systems . The money is there . It is just being wasted , most recently on huge campaigns to defeat national health reform and false advertising to defeat Proposition 186 . Many voters are starting to look past the propaganda and cliches , but two major concerns remain . The first is : &quot; If I have good insurance now , what ' s in it for me ? &quot; My wife and I have excellent insurance . We pay no premiums , have some choice and low deductibles . But we still lack what we most long for : security . If I become disabled and lose my job and my ability to pay premiums , I lose_it all . You may be terribly disappointed with even good insurance once you need it for a chronic disease , devastating illness or long-term care . The list of reasons for which people lose their health_insurance is endless . The second concern is cost ; we don ' t want to pay more taxes . Most of us already pay heavy health-care taxes in the form of constantly rising premiums . In addition , we all pay_for our care through deductibles and co-payments that can go_into the thousands . The overwhelming majority of middle-income Californians will pay less in taxes than they are now paying_for health coverage . The Congressional Budget Office , after reviewing all alternatives , concluded that single-payer is the only plan that would cover all Americans , reduce health expenditures and reduce the deficit . One of the major strategies of those who want to deny us our rights is to villainize our northern neighbor ' s health-care system . But poll after poll has shown the Canadian public and physicians to be very satisfied with their system . Canadians have universal coverage and total health security ; 95 % of all medical services in Canada are administered within 24 hours of need ; Canadian medicine remains at the frontier of medical_science , with developments of such innovative therapies as lung and bone_marrow transplants , which are performed on a higher per-capita basis in Canada and denied to many Americans with &quot; good &quot; insurance under the pretext that they are &quot; investigational therapy. &quot; I studied medicine because I wanted to engage in the healing arts , not in business administration . Please vote &quot; yes &quot; on 186 to restore this privilege to me and thousands of my fellow physicians and to give yourself what you so truly deserve : your right to a doctor .</TEXT>
