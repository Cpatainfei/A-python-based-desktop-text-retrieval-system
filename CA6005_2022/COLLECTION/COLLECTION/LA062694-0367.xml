   <HEADLINE> TURNING_UP HEAT ON TOBACCO FIRMS ; AS TAXPAYER-FUNDED ANTI-SMOKING ADS GET BOLDER , SOME SAY THEY OVERSTATE THE DANGERS OF CIGARETTES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surely you ' ve seen it : the television commercial depicting a tobacco executive telling a series of lies , his head shrinking into his collar as he repeatedly contradicts himself . Finally his head vanishes in a puff of smoke . Then there ' s the ad that follows a smoker through his day , numbering the people who come_into contact with his secondhand smoke -- 37 people , including his wife and daughter , who &quot; will die a little , because they were forced to breathe the smoke from his cigarette. &quot; Since 1990 , California ' s Department of Health Services has been buying_time on television and radio and space on billboards to change public attitudes about smoking . These ads have won the enmity of the tobacco_industry as well as numerous national and international media awards . The most recent commercials , many of them targeting teen-agers and emphasizing the dangers of secondhand smoke , are tougher than ever . Indeed , there has never been a media campaign quite like this before -- and you would have to look_at negative political ads to find advertising that attacks the opposition with such joyful abandon . These messages , with their savage bite , are the most visible use of the 25-cents-a-pack tobacco tax included in Proposition 99 , the voter-approved anti-smoking initiative . The measure did not mention a media campaign at all , but the legislation that authorized spending of the tax money required one and gave state officials only four months to begin it . &quot; There ' s been nothing like this ever before in the rest of the world , &quot; said Colleen Stevens , who heads the state ' s anti-tobacco media campaign . There is some evidence that the ads have been working . A period of rapid decline in cigarette sales in California coincides with the launching of the first barrage of ads in April , 1990 . When Stevens , a career health administrator with a degree in social_work , began to put_together the first advertising_campaign , she had nowhere to turn for advice . California health officials had produced educational health films and public_service messages before -- mostly low-budget announcements shown at no cost at odd hours on commercial television . But this was to be an ambitious program with a big-time budget -- more_than $ 28 million in the first two years . But public health officials point_out that the amount is a pittance compared to what tobacco companies are spending to peddle their products -- an estimated $ 1 million a day in California . From the start , the ads took_aim at the tobacco_industry . One of the early spots portrayed a corporate_executive asking his colleagues to help him solve a problem . &quot; We need more cigarette_smokers , &quot; he declares . &quot; Pure and simple . Every day , two thousand Americans stop smoking and another 1 # 100 also quit . &quot; Actually , technically , they die . That means that this business needs three thousand fresh , new volunteers every day . So , forget about all that heart_disease , cancer , emphysema , stroke stuff. &quot; Just days before the department was going_to release the first commercials , then-Gov . George Deukmejian got his first look_at them . Department officials waited in_suspense for several days before Deukmejian , a pro-business conservative , delivered judgment on the campaign . The ads ran . Gov . Pete Wilson suspended the ad_campaign in 1992 during one of the state ' s seemingly never-ending budget crises . The American Lung Assn . successfully sued to restore the funding . But Wilson ' s action interrupted advertising for many months . Since the lawsuit , the governor has been protective of the tobacco-control media budget . In January , he called_for spending $ 12.9 million on the ad_campaign in the coming fiscal_year -- the same level as this year . But recently , he cut $ 2 million from that proposal . Stevens praises Wilson ' s support for the ad_campaign : &quot; I think this is a governor who believes_in prevention , and ( smoking ) is the No . 1 preventable cause of death and disability in the United States. &quot; She agrees with observers who say the most recent commercials and billboards make the earlier media campaign seem tame by comparison . &quot; We ' re finding ways of making our messages clearer and more meaningful , &quot; Stevens said . Using market research techniques , the health department has learned how to target its messages -- aiming at teen-agers and members of ethnic_groups that have relatively high smoking rates . From the start , the state has bought advertising time on the Fox Network , which has high viewership among young people and minority groups . Lately , the state has been reaching_out to a youthful audience by airing ads on MTV . The department ' s outdoor advertising_campaign emphasizes the effect of smoking on nonsmokers : &quot; Try secondhand smoke ! &quot; states one recent billboard . &quot; Get all_of the effects of smoking without those pesky filters ! Secondhand smoke kills. &quot; A television ad states that &quot; 5 # 100 Californians die every year from breathing secondhand smoke. &quot; These and other ads have prompted complaints from pro-smoking groups , charging that the messages overstate dangers to nonsmokers by assuming a national death rate due_to secondhand smoke of 50 # 000 deaths a year . &quot; Even the Environmental Protection Agency ( which concluded that secondhand smoke can cause cancer ) won ' t endorse 50 # 000 deaths a year , &quot; said Bob Merrell , who heads Californians for Smokers ' Rights .</TEXT>
