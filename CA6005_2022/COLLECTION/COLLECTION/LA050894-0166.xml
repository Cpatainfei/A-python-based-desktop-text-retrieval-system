   <HEADLINE> CIVIL WAR RAGES AMONG HOLOCAUST REVISIONISTS ; COURTS : AT STAKE ARE CONTROL OF THE COSTA MESA INSTITUTE FOR HISTORICAL REVIEW AND A $ 10-MILLION BEQUEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the morning of the coup d ' etat , Willis Carto could be found clinging_to the glass doors of his cherished institute like a tough sea barnacle . Swiftly , the mutineers moved to oust Carto , a stubborn and wiry man of 67 years who had founded and shaped the obscure Institute for Historical Review into a right-wing think_tank that critics call the &quot; spine of the international Holocaust denial movement. &quot; The insurrection finished with a slam of a door and Carto in the cold . But it did not put a close to the civil_war that rages within a small circle of Holocaust &quot; historical revisionists , &quot; who are more accustomed to fighting facts like the gas_ovens of Auschwitz or the World_War_II extermination of 6 million Jews . Since that sunny autumn day Oct . 15 -- when the founder and the institute ' s insurgent staff unclenched their fists and laid_down a club , a cement-filled can , wire-clippers , a sawed-off garden handle and a handgun -- the rival factions have continued battling for control of the institute with lawsuits and poisonous prose . The bitter power struggle is outlined in voluminous court documents in three lawsuits filed_in Orange County Superior_Court . Carto has declined to discuss the_matter except through his court declarations and letters to supporters . At stake is not only the 16-year-old Costa Mesa-based institute and its shadowy web of political connections , but a generous bequest of more_than $ 10 million in_stock share certificates from the late granddaughter of inventor Thomas_Edison . And much like their lingering squabble over history , everyone involved has a sinister theory about the spark that burned the bonds of the founder and staff of six longtime editorial employees . Subterranean forces . Greed . Money . Racism . Inadequate health benefits . &quot; I ' m sure this is personally difficult for Carto , &quot; said Kenneth S . Stern , the author of &quot; Holocaust Denial &quot; and the American Jewish Committee ' s specialist on hate groups . &quot; This is the man behind the curtain who has been pulling the strings for years . Carto was the guiding force behind the institute , the one who pulled_together the white_supremacists and neo-Nazis . Is it going_to fall_apart ? These people are all committed to the same goals . They ' re fighting over money , tactics and personality , but their common agenda is one of promoting Nazism and xenophobia. &quot; Mainstream Jewish organizations , alarmed by the spread of Holocaust denial theories , said the split is a boon because it divided key figures who promote the movement as a serious enterprise . &quot; Whenever enemies are fighting with each other that is a positive sign , &quot; said Aaron Breitbart , a senior researcher for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles . &quot; Let them shoot each other . You don ' t hear a lot of human_rights groups talking_about this because they feel they should fight it out . Maybe they ' ll manage to wreck each other ' s camp. &quot; * From an unassuming suburban headquarters in Orange County , the institute has emerged over the last decade as an international forum for right-wing ideologues from Europe and the United States who have used the pages of the institute ' s glossy Journal of Historical Review to debate arcane themes such_as whether the diary of Anne Frank was a fraud or the concentration_camp gas_chambers possessed the actual capacity to execute 6 million Jews . In 1985 , the institute reaped international publicity and Movie of the Week immortality after it paid $ 90 # 000 to settle a lawsuit filed by an Auschwitz concentration_camp survivor , Mel Mermelstein . Mermelstein sued after unsuccessfully demanding the institute ' s $ 50 # 000 reward offer for proof that the Nazis operated execution gas_chambers . Since Carto ' s unceremonious ouster , his wife and another ally have filed a lawsuit and an appeal in Orange County Superior_Court seeking unsuccessfully to regain control of the institute . He has also circulated angry letters , linking the rebel staff to his familiar enemies like Mermelstein , the Anti- Defamation League of B ' nai B ' rith and a catch-all category of &quot; political Zionists. &quot; In court documents , he hints that the Church of Scientology is a backstage force ; two of the rebel staff_members are Scientologists who deny religion played a role in the takeover . &quot; It is certain there are many_more motives at_work , &quot; Carto wrote in a letter shared with his supporters , &quot; not the least of which -- in addition to Zionist forces -- are pure greed and also the involvement of a bizarre , mind-bending , Jim Jones-like cult , which has a long history of infiltrating and ruining organizations. &quot; * Clearly , Carto was a man who selected his enemies with care . Over 16 years , he handpicked or approved every one of the rebel staff_members who shared his theories that the Holocaust killings had been greatly exaggerated for WWII propaganda . One of the most enduring figures of the postwar right , Carto had been_active in conservative politics since the 1950s when he organized the Liberty Lobby , a Washington-based group which publishes a weekly tabloid called The Spotlight that was supportive of former Klansman David Duke ' s political aspirations . The Anti-Defamation League of B ' nai B ' rith scorns the lobby as &quot; the most active anti-Semitic organization in the country . . . a multimillion operation. &quot; Irwin Suall , director of fact finding for the ADL in New York , said his organization has been monitoring Carto ' s activities for decades . &quot; We regard him as probably the leading anti-Semite in the country because of his funds , resources and publications at his command , &quot; he said . Yet , even with that well-known reputation , the staff eventually came_to view their founder as an edgy , cantankerous Captain Queeg who was steering the institute too far starboard . In interviews , they complained that he treated them like children and skimped on their pay . He was so intent_on saving money , they said , that he lowered the air conditioning during peak summer days . He exhorted them to conserve paper clips . Longstanding employees said they lacked health benefits , a sore issue that a lower-ranking staff_member huffed about even in the midst of the October coup d ' etat . They blamed Carto , too , for economizing on the institute ' s fire_insurance coverage , which became a compelling issue after the group ' s former quarters in Torrance were destroyed in a July , 1984 , firebombing that caused $ 300 # 000 in damages . The group was insured for only $ 50 # 000 . One employee bitterly observed in a court declaration that only Carto ' s locked personal office -- which contained four heavy bronze busts of Hitler -- was unscathed by fire . And in interviews and court documents , they criticized Carto for botching the handling of the celebrated Mermelstein case , which later was made into a Movie of the Week with Leonard Nimoy and Dabney Coleman in starring roles . &quot; Carto ' s launching and subsequent mishandling of the reward offer wound_up costing a $ 90 # 000 settlement with Mermelstein and another $ 30 # 000 in attorney ' s fees and $ 20 # 000 in lost productivity , not to mention embarrassment and widespread alienation of supporters , &quot; wrote director Thomas J . Marcellus in a court declaration in connection with the lawsuit debating control of the institute . * But the growing resentment finally exploded on the issue of race . &quot; Our main problem was editorial direction , &quot; Mark Weber , editor of the Journal for Historic Review , said in an interview . &quot; He wanted to make substantive changes in the direction of the review . He wanted to become more ' racialist , ' to make_it more clearly white racist. &quot; Carto ' s intent became clear last April , according Marcellus , who remembered a table-pounding session of outbursts &quot; a la Nikita Khrushchev. &quot; While the senior staff editors listened_in dismay , they said , Carto declared his intention to slash journal stories devoted to the Holocaust by 80 % . Eventually , they were told , the topic would vanish entirely along with the name of the journal . &quot; The focus of the new journal would be race and multiculturalism , &quot; recalled Weber in a letter to subscribers . &quot; In one written memo , Carto called_for an article to appear ' proving ' the partial African ancestry of President ( Dwight ) Eisenhower . . . . The staff told Carto that to transform our journal into such a periodical would be suicidal. &quot; For years , they had tried to win a measure of credibility for their movement with a journal that strived for a sober tone although mainstream historians still scoffed at the results . Suddenly , it appeared to the staff_members that their glossy , scholarly-looking journal -- with a paid circulation of 6 # 000 -- was in danger of transforming into little more_than a crude racist rag . * In his own correspondence to old allies in the Holocaust denial movement , Carto would later argue that he simply was trying to expand the focus of the journal to include articles on ancient history , culture , art , religion , philosophy , social and racial matters . The staff didn ' t buy the Renaissance argument ; they threatened mass resignation . &quot; Having suffered Carto ' s machinations , hair-brained ( sic ) schemes , mismanagement , insults and irrationality long enough , the senior staff met to determine the course of action to stop Carto from taking harmful actions , &quot; said Marcellus in his court declaration . They quickly devised a strategy , turning for advice to the same Santa Ana attorney who had defended the institute in the Mermelstein lawsuit . One of the employees started researching Carto ' s ties to the institute ' s parent corporation , the Legion for the Survival of Freedom Inc. He discovered , according to the staff ' s court declarations , that the Texas-based nonprofit corporation had listed a corporate director who had been dead for five years . Then as the summer progressed , Marcellus discovered a $ 100 # 000 bank order for Carto ' s Liberty Lobby . It was drawn_on a Swiss bank_account holding funds for the Legion from the Jean Farrel Edison bequest , according to court documents . Edison , the granddaughter of Thomas_Edison , was a heiress to the Edison fortune who died in 1985 , leaving conflicting instructions about the dispersal of her estate . A handwritten will bequeathed the money -- then estimated at $ 40 million -- to a South African-born woman who was Edison ' s neighbor in Switzerland . The Legion also had a claim to the money because Edison left further instructions that only a Legion representative could open the four safe-deposit_boxes in Europe , Asia and the United States , which contained cash certificates for the money . Three of the boxes and $ 20 million in certificates were found , according to Suall of the ADL , who said the fourth box_in Singapore was never located . The Legion and the neighbor fought over the money in Swiss courts , eventually splitting the estate in 1990 . During settlement conferences related to the Mermelstein case , the institute ' s attorney , William S . Hulsey , remembered how Carto acknowledged the existence of the legacy , describing it as &quot; considerably smaller because it had been contested by various Jewish groups. &quot; &quot; Carto told me that he had been distributing the Farrel Edison bequest ' to good causes ' but did not say to whom , &quot; Marcellus said in court documents . He added that Carto ' s wife , Elisabeth , told him that Carto had set_up a separate corporation called Vebit Inc. to control the money and loan it back to the Legion . The loans and debts would then make the Legion an unappealing target for lawsuits , according to Marcellus . * For years , said Marcellus , the institute , which has a mailing_list of 30 # 000 , had shifted its assets between various corporations to avoid losing property in an unfavorable lawsuit . But never had they considered that they would unleash the lawyers on each other . In his court declaration , Carto lashed_out at the accusations of &quot; lying , cheating , falsifying , committing fraud etc . These brazen smears prove that ( the staff ) is trying to obfuscate the one significant fact : that I founded and built the IHR using what help I could get and usually paying_for it with the dollars of sincere and concerned Americans . And I did this in the teeth of the opposition of extremely powerful and entrenched forces , which had no wish to have me succeed. &quot; Eventually , the senior staff_members and their attorney would persuade two elderly directors of the board for the Legion to resign because of the allegations about Carto . Then the remaining third board_member was enlisted to appoint a slate of new directors in the rebel camp . That director , Thomas Kerr , eventually came_to regret his decision . &quot; I was misled as_to the facts , &quot; said Kerr , a retiree and part-time translator who added in an interview that he appointed new board_members because he thought he had no other choice . &quot; I think it ' s all about money . They believe Willis Carto has a tremendous amount_of_money that was left to the Legion in the will . They think he has it and they mean to get ahold of it. &quot; In September , the new board voted to terminate all association with Carto . At present , the fractured relationship of Carto and his historians are being sorted_out in Orange County Superior_Court where the three lawsuits stemming from the takeover are pending . In one case , Judge Robert J . Polis already has ruled that the new board has authority to run the institute , concluding that &quot; Willis Carto was exercising substantial control over the Legion without any apparent legal authority. &quot; * Still awaiting judgment is the staff ' s civil damage claim for the fateful fall day when Carto returned to the headquarters after the senior editors engineered his termination . While the editors were away , Carto notified their attorney that he was seizing control . Meanwhile , according to remaining staff_members , Carto and his wife and three men set_about disconnecting the office telephones , disabling the computers and changing the locks . &quot; It was hard to keep_from laughing , &quot; recalled Hulsey , the staff attorney who raced to the office after receiving the faxed declaration of war . &quot; It was like something out of Woody Allen ' s Banana Republic . Who would control the headquarters ? The staff arrives , forces the door and then fistfights start breaking_out all over. &quot; Eventually police arrived and Carto was arrested along with some of the other staff_members . Charges were never filed against any of them . Hulsey ' s last memory of the melee is an indelible image of Willis Carto with one foot wedged in the door . Nearby a staff editor brandished a gun to break_up a wrestling match on the floor . Meanwhile , other institute historians were struggling mightily to shove Carto out the door . The founder ' s screams filled the room : &quot; You ' re killing me ! &quot;</TEXT>
