   <HEADLINE> U.S. FLIERS BELIEVED HELD BY LAOS AT VIETNAM_WAR ' S END ; EVIDENCE : NEW DATA INDICATES AS MANY AS 41 U.S. PRISONERS WERE NOT RELEASED . OFFICIALLY , ONLY TWO AMERICANS WERE KNOWN TO BE IN CUSTODY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From a huge archive of documents about the Vietnam_War declassified in recent months , new evidence is emerging that some American pilots held prisoner in Laos were not released at the end of the war , and that U.S. intelligence officials might have known where some of them were . The Defense_Department lists 330 Americans , almost all pilots and crew , as missing in action in Laos . Most were certainly killed when their planes crashed in the remote jungles of the mountainous , sparsely populated country . Officially , only two American fliers , Col . Charles Shelton and Lt . Col . David Hrdlicka , are known for certain to have been alive in custody of pro-communist Pathet Lao rebels . Shelton and Hrdlicka died in captivity in the 1960s , Pentagon officials believe . But declassified documents from the State_Department , the Central_Intelligence_Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency provide some support for those who argue that the number of prisoners was considerably higher , perhaps as high as 41 Americans . Some military intelligence specialists and prisoner_of_war activists have believed for years that U.S. prisoners may have been left_behind in Laos . Senior officials of the Richard Nixon Administration , in anguished testimony before a Senate committee in September , 1992 , acknowledged that they feared it was true at the time but said they decided then there was little they could do . Of the 591 Americans released by North Vietnam in &quot; Operation Homecoming &quot; in 1973 , only nine had been captured in Laos , and those nine were in custody of the North Vietnamese , not the Laotians . None had been held by the Pathet Lao in areas of northeast Laos where , according to some intelligence documents , groups of downed U.S. fliers were kept prisoner . In the negotiations with North Vietnam that produced the Paris Peace Agreement and ended U.S. involvement in the war in January , 1973 , Nixon ' s national security adviser , Henry A . Kissinger , repeatedly sought assurances from the North Vietnamese that they would deliver all U.S. prisoners &quot; throughout Indochina &quot; in the postwar prisoner exchanges . The United States never acknowledged officially participating in a war in Laos , and Laos was not a party to the Paris accord . U.S. negotiators believed , however , that the Pathet Lao communists were , in Kissinger ' s term , &quot; stooges &quot; of the North Vietnamese and would deliver their prisoners if ordered to by Hanoi . U.S. officials were shocked when only nine were delivered from Laos , according to declassified documents and testimony at the 1992 hearings . Lawrence S . Eagleburger , then a senior Pentagon official and later secretary_of_state in the final months of the George_Bush Administration , wrote in a memo to his then-boss , Defense_Secretary Elliot L . Richardson , that after the last of the acknowledged prisoners had been released , the United States should stage a &quot; demarche , &quot; or diplomatic initiative , on the Laotians about the rest . &quot; This initiative should plainly and forcefully assert that the U.S. will no longer play games with the POW issue in Laos , &quot; said the memo , written a week before the final prisoner release . The Laotian communists &quot; should be told that we have reason to believe they hold additional U.S. prisoners , and we demand their immediate release , as well as an accounting and information on all those who may have died. &quot; Nixon , in an address to the nation at the conclusion of Operation Homecoming , said : &quot; All of our American POWs are_on their way home. &quot; Later in the same speech , he said provisions of the Paris agreement regarding Laos &quot; have not been complied with , &quot; but he did not indicate there might still be U.S. prisoners there . Several times in the next few months of 1973 , he repeated that all prisoners had come_home . But the declassified documents show there was intelligence information that the Pathet Lao held some U.S. fliers in caves near Pathet Lao headquarters in Sam Neua , in northeastern Laos near the border with Vietnam . Asked by a House committee in 1976 how it could be that none of more_than 300 Americans lost in Laos could be a prisoner , Vernon E . Walters Jr. , then deputy director of the CIA , replied in writing that &quot; this question has been very disconcerting to the intelligence community also . We have information that some of these 300 individuals survived their shoot-down incident . Admittedly , the number is small. &quot; If any of the intelligence information were correct , the apparent conclusion is that some men were abandoned to their fates when the last U.S. troops left Indochina , unless the Pathet Lao killed them , as some U.S. officials believe . Among the documents supporting this view : -- A January , 1973 , CIA listing of &quot; confirmed enemy prisons &quot; in Laos , with locations . Several of these carry descriptions of the likely inmates : &quot; American prisoners , &quot; &quot; American pilots ( possibly 20 ) , &quot; &quot; approximately 15 American prisoners &quot; and &quot; American pilots ( possibly in a cave. ) &quot; -- Minutes of a Washington interagency meeting , about the same time , in which the Defense_Department representative is recorded as saying : &quot; We don ' t know what we will get from Laos ( in postwar prisoner exchanges. ) We have only six known prisoners in Laos , although we hope there may be 40 or 41 . We have known very little about the caves where they keep the prisoners in Laos . We just got the first photos of those caves recently and our impression is they are pretty big . We think they are holding a lot more_than six prisoners there. &quot; -- A Defense Intelligence Agency account of a Laotian communist soldier , described as &quot; cooperative . . . intelligent . . . sincere . . . has a good memory , &quot; who entered a cave_in northeastern Laos in March , 1972 , to replace the batteries in a field telephone . There , he said , he encountered three American , four Thai and four royalist Laotian prisoners , all said to be healthy and adequately fed . They had books and a guitar for entertainment . -- A 1970 CIA report saying that &quot; until recently , the Ban Nakay Neua VH 1965 ( a location designation ) prison complex was the only prison facility in Laos known to contain American POWs. &quot; Ban Nakay Neua was the region of northern Laos where prisoners were believed to have been held_in caves . None of the Americans released from Laos in_Operation Homecoming had been held there , so what happened to the prisoners &quot; known &quot; to have been in the caves ? -- A 1992 deposition given to Senate investigators by Bobby Ray Inman , President Clinton ' s nominee to be secretary_of_defense and a senior naval intelligence_officer at the time of the 1973 prisoner releases , in which he testified that &quot; in ' 73 a large_number of us thought there were ( prisoners in Laos ) , simply because we had known people had gotten_to the ground , that there were substantial prisoners in Laos that were unaccounted for. &quot; Inman added , however , that he later changed his opinion . When none of those men ever surfaced or was found , he said , he decided that either the original assumption of their safe landing was incorrect or the Pathet Lao shot the prisoners rather than keep them . Also in the files is a 1992 CIA memo saying that &quot; photographs taken by a reconnaissance aircraft in October , 1969 , show what may be as_many as 20 non-Asians accompanied by Pathet Lao guards near caves &quot; at Ban Nakay Neua . This was a reference_to the &quot; volleyball photos , &quot; a subject of furious disagreement in the intelligence and MIA activist community since their existence became known almost a decade ago . To the untrained eye , these aerial photographs of a jungle clearing appear to show 20 non-Asian men in identical clothing , surrounded by armed men in the black uniforms often worn by the Pathet Lao . In some of the prints , the non-Asian men appear to be playing volleyball . Defense_Department officials long have insisted that expert analysis of these photos shows they are not what they appear to be . But activists -- including Sen . Robert C . Smith ( R-N.H. ) -- who believe the Pentagon has a &quot; mind-set to debunk &quot; such information are citing the CIA memo as validation of their belief that the photos show American prisoners who never came_home . None of the evidence is conclusive . The Defense Intelligence Agency repeatedly has argued that no information has ever been verified that would show specific American individuals at specific locations , aside from Shelton and Hrdlicka .</TEXT>
