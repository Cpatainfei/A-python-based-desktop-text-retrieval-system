   <HEADLINE> SAMPRAS RESURFACES , AND HE ' S READY TO GO ; U.S. OPEN : DEFENDING CHAMPION APPEARS SHARP IN PRACTICE_SESSION WITH EDBERG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a Pete Sampras sighting Sunday . Turns_out he is alive and well and about 99 % ready to defend his U.S. Open tennis title the next two weeks . Sampras is the No . 1-ranked men ' s player in the world , winner of four of the last five Grand_Slam events . He is currently so_much better than the rest of the men ' s field that no less than Boris Becker said recently , with only partial tongue in cheek , that his goal and that of most of the other top men right now is to &quot; try to bother Pete a little bit. &quot; Sampras , after winning his second consecutive Wimbledon title this summer and limping through a Davis Cup match July 17 , disappeared from the tennis scene . He canceled_out of tournaments in Washington , Toronto , Cincinnati and Indianapolis -- the traditional summer hardcourt tuneup events for the Open -- and even pulled_out of the doubles competition last Tuesday at a tournament called the Hamlet Cup in Commack , N.Y. , where he had been scheduled to play with Richey Reneberg . The culprit was a pair of new shoes that caused a sore left ankle , at first diagnosed as tendinitis and , more recently , as calcium deposits on a ligament . This was no injury of convenience to get_out of tournament commitments ; nor was it one of those soccer injuries where the weeping and drama far outstrip the pain . His coach , Tim Gullikson , said Sunday morning , &quot; When Pete pulled_out of the doubles last Tuesday , he did so because he just couldn ' t have played . The doctor said he couldn ' t go , that he still needed more rest. &quot; that ' s what made Sunday morning ' s Sampras sighting so significant . It was 10:45 a.m. on Center Court at the U.S. Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow . Sampras was playing practice_games with Stefan Edberg , the only man other_than Sampras to win the U.S. Open in the 1990s -- Sampras won in 1990 and ' 93 , Edberg in ' 91 and ' 92 . People pay hundreds of dollars to see these two play . But since this practice_session wasn ' t a scheduled event , the crowd was 46 . Those who watched closely saw the Sampras of old . The serve crackled , the movements were fluid , the timing sharp . The two superstars played for more_than 1 1 / 2 hours and , had anybody been keeping score , Sampras would have won . What really counted , though , was how Sampras ' heavily taped left ankle fared . &quot; It ' s OK , not too_bad , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; I felt good out there. &quot; Gullikson agreed . &quot; I ' m sure it is a little tender , and I ' m sure it is going_to be , &quot; he said . &quot; But he moved pretty good out there today , even though he is probably still holding_back a little . I ' m confident it is going_to be A-OK. &quot; Gullikson , who took_over as Sampras ' coach in 1992 , when Sampras was ranked No . 6 , said he is stepping_up the intensity and frequency of the practice_sessions . Sampras plays 22-year-old South_African qualifier Kevin Ullyett in the first round , but it hadn ' t been determined as of Sunday morning whether that match will be Tuesday or Wednesday . &quot; I ' m watching that closely , so that we can ease back a bit the day before he plays , &quot; said Gullikson , who added that Sampras had also practiced hard the day before against qualifier Wade McGuire , a friend from the Tampa area and more of a baseliner than Edberg . &quot; I want him to get comfortable for any kind of game , but mostly I ' m doing what I ' ve always done with Pete -- keep it simple . I want his mind uncluttered when he goes_out there . I want him at such a high level , as he has been the last year and a half or two years , that the other guys have to adjust to him , rather than him adjusting . &quot; Pete playing_at his best is like the old Green_Bay Packers . They were going_to run the power sweep , you knew they were going_to run it , and it was up_to you to stop it. &quot; Steffi Graf , seeded No . 1 among the women , has also been bothered by an injury that , like Sampras ' , is expected to be sufficiently healed to allow her to be the likely winner . Graf , who won U.S. Open titles in 1988 , ' 89 and ' 93 , will test her sore back in a first-round match Tuesday or Wednesday against wild-card entry Ann Mall of La Mesa . The second-seeded players each have a match on opening day today . Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia will play_on the Grandstand court against Markus Zoecke of Germany , and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain will take_on Linda Ferrando of Italy in the opener on Center Court . Although both matches should easily follow form , Ferrando is_best known for ousting Monica Seles in the 1990 U.S. Open . Among the more interesting story lines in this year ' s event will be in women ' s doubles , in which Natalie Zvereva and Gigi Fernandez will attempt to complete the doubles Grand_Slam that eluded them a year ago . Last year , they won the Australian , French and Wimbledon titles before going_out in the U.S. Open semifinals to Sanchez Vicario and Helena Sukova . This year , Zvereva suffered a stress_fracture in her ribs just prior to the women ' s event at La Costa the first week in August . She pulled_out of that tournament , and also the women ' s event at Manhattan Beach . The injury remains serious enough for her to also have pulled_out of the singles here , but she will play doubles in her quest_for the Slam , something that hasn ' t been achieved in women ' s doubles since Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver did_it in 1984 . In men ' s doubles , last year ' s winners , Ken Flach and Rick Leach , both U.S. Davis Cup veterans , have split_up . Flach will play with his brother , Doug , and Leach with South_African Danie Visser . Neither team is seeded . Tennis Notes John McEnroe avenged his defeat of a year ago in the third annual Arthur Ashe AIDS Tennis Challenge , beating Andre Agassi on Sunday in a 9-7 tiebreaker that featured the normal clowning for a national television audience . The highlights were Agassi ' s 117-m.p.h. serve aimed at McEnroe ' s head that barely missed and chair umpire Bill Cosby ' s obvious bias toward the older McEnroe . A crowd of 15 # 763 , most of whom paid $ 12 each , helped to further contribute to the Ashe AIDS Foundation , which has raised more_than $ 4 million in three years . . . . The men ' s and women ' s U.S. Open singles champions will each receive $ 550 # 000 , an increase of $ 15 # 000 from last year . . . . The U.S. Tennis Assn . will honor the 25th anniversary year of Rod Laver ' s 1969 Grand_Slam sweep with a Rod Laver Day here Sept . 7 . Laver , a resident of Rancho Mirage , won $ 16 # 000 the last time he won the U.S. Open in ' 69 . . . . Meilen Tu , 16 , of Northridge will make her U.S. Open debut today , playing the first match on Court 12 against Silvia Farina , a 22-year-old from Italy . Tu got a berth by winning the USTA Junior title this year . . . . Gabriela Sabatini , who won the U.S. Open in 1990 , has become pretty much of a non-factor on the tour and is seeded eighth . . . . Amy Frazier , who went_through the L.A. Slims tournament without losing a set , is seeded 16th . . . . As in past years , the USA cable network will handle U.S. Open telecasts when CBS is not . USA will carry 86 1 / 2 hours of the event , starting this morning and going right through the event ' s final day , when it will show the women ' s doubles final . USA ' s main commentators will be John McEnroe , Tracy Austin , Virginia Wade and Barry McKay . . . . CBS will handle 39 hours of the prime matches , with telecasts the first weekend through Labor_Day and Saturday and Sunday of the final weekend . Announcers include Jim Nantz , Mary Carillo , Tim Ryan and Tony Trabert .</TEXT>
