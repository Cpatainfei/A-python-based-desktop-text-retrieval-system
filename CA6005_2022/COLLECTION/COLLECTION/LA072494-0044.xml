   <HEADLINE> LET ' S R-U-M-B-L-E ! ! ! ; SHARP JABS , VICIOUS UPPERCUTS AND STINGING HOOKS AT THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP POETRY BOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> 1 . The Buildup . Bets are down . Brown paper_bags have sprouted , Bible-Belt style , amid forests of 7-Up and Coke cans . The capacity crowd of more_than 500 , which has paid $ 15 for general admission tickets and $ 25 for ringside_seats , has just settled_down inside the remodeled Piggly Wiggly Super-Market when referee Peter Rabbit slinks into the middle of the ring . Long and lanky , wearing a fedora and a thrift-shop seersucker suit , Rabbit grabs a microphone as it descends into his hand . &quot; From Ramona ' s dance_hall in beautiful Taos , New Mexico , &quot; Rabbit thunders , &quot; the Poetry Capital of the World . . . &quot; The crowd explodes into cheers . &quot; . . . the challenger Quincy Troupe versus the champion Simon Ortiz . . . for the Heavyweight Poetry Championship of the World ! &quot; The wise_guys on the back patio at the Caffe Tazza have established Ortiz , who is from Acoma Pueblo , the oldest continuously inhabited place in North_America , as the home state favorite at 7-5 . 2 . The Prize . A spotlight focuses_on the Max M . Finstein Memorial Poetry Prize -- a bronzed boxing_glove atop a wooden pyramid -- known simply as &quot; The Max &quot; and named in honor of the poet , communard and con_man who died in 1980 when his pickup_truck spun_off the road in a snowstorm on his way to Los Angeles . Leaning_against the trophy is a fist-sized silver belt_buckle engraved with the words &quot; The Max. &quot; Beside it is a navy-blue baseball_cap , the bill bordered with cut beads plotted and sewn by Cheyenne artist Joyce Starr . The crown says in white letters &quot; World Heavyweight Champion Poet. &quot; 3 . The Rules . Two poets , last year ' s champ and a challenger , selected by the World Poetry Bout Assn. , compete in a 10-round bard-off . In theory , scoring is based on the Illinois Boxing Commission ' s 10-point must system . Each of the three judges , using entirely personal criteria , must award 10 points to the round ' s winner ; the loser usually gets nine unless there ' s an intellectual knockdown . In practice , the judges simply designate the winner for each round . Poets must employ the naked human voice only , except during the seventh round , when accompaniment is allowed . ( Last year , in taking the championship from Ntozake Shange , who used a boombox tape to back her poem , Ortiz shuffled river stones against one another to frame the title piece of his collection , &quot; Woven Stone. &quot; ) The 10th round is extemporaneous . Each poet draws a slip_of_paper from a hat and has 30 seconds to create a poem based on the idea or phrase on the paper . ( Bout vets still consider Victor Hernandez Cruz ' s inspired 1989 improvisation on the word &quot; mud &quot; the finest 10th round in championship history. ) This year , for the first time , poems must remain within a five-minute limit . ( Wags refer to this as the Anne Waldman rule. ) 4 . The Contestants . In the recesses of Ramona ' s , handlers are giving the poets last-minute instructions . &quot; It ' s a great crowd , &quot; Quincy ' s wife , Margaret , exhorts . &quot; Don ' t hold anything back. &quot; Ortiz huddles in the green room with two Indian poets , Lance Henson and Sherman Alexie , who read in a preliminary bout two nights before . &quot; And in the Red Corner . . . &quot; Rabbit intones , gesturing to an empty stool on the right side of the ring . &quot; He battles demons every day . He walks unknown trails and many follow . New Mexico can be very proud_of S-i-i-m-on &quot; -- he elongates the syllables , stretching them back like the rubber in a slingshot -- &quot; Or-t-i-i-z ! ! &quot; The slight , bespectacled Ortiz , dressed for work in sneakers and jeans , bounces down the aisle , carrying a folder full of poems . The audience rises to cheer . Ortiz ' s sister , who has never heard him read , surprises him with a shout of &quot; My brother ! &quot; and hugs him before he can reach the stage . Son of a railroad worker and a distinguished potter , Ortiz has been the Acomas ' official &quot; interpreter &quot; to the outer world and a lieutenant_governor of his pueblo , and is probably the greatest of all American_Indian poets . The Native Writers ' Circle of the Americas , an organization of indigenous writers , last year named him the winner of its second annual Lifetime Achievement award ( novelist N . Scott Momaday won the first ) . In 1992 , Ortiz wrote the narrative for the PBS documentary &quot; Surviving Columbus. &quot; His 14th collection , &quot; After and Before the Lightning , &quot; will be published this month . A man of humility and strength , Ortiz is also , when alcohol engulfs him , a mean , scary , falling-down drunk , who knows the insides of VA hospitals all_over the West . This contradiction is often at the center of his poems . &quot; And in the Black Corner . . . &quot; Rabbit growls , pointing to the stool at his left . &quot; His line is long . He spits on capital letters . He ' s gonna knock you out ! The challenger , Quincy ' The Jazzman ' Troupe ! ! &quot; At 6 feet , 2 inches and 220 pounds , Troupe towers over Ortiz . A professor of American and Caribbean literature and creative writing at UC San Diego , winner of the 1980 American Book Award for Poetry for &quot; Snake-back Solos &quot; and the co-author of &quot; Miles : The Autobiography , &quot; one of the most inspiring books ever written_about American music , Troupe strides down the aisle in a T-shirt imprinted with Miles Davis ' face , his dreads bouncing underneath a multicolored baseball_cap with &quot; music heals &quot; scrawled across the bill . The applause is noticeably restrained . 5 . Your Reporter -- I own a pair of Maxes myself -- the original version , designed by Linda Fleming , a solid bronze boxing glove on an industrial spring . One sits on top of the TV_set . The other I use as a doorstop . I won my first Max in 1984 , when I blew Chicago poet Terry Jacobus out of the ring . To this day , he disputes the decision . Jacobus is not the only poet who swears he or she ' s been robbed . The great Nuyorican poet Victor Hernandez Cruz still won ' t accept that Anne Waldman , the doyenne of Boulder ' s Naropa Institute , the Buddhist Notre Dame , defeated him in 1989 . Andrei Codrescu , best known for his surreal mini-raps on National Public Radio ' s &quot; All Things Considered , &quot; has never admitted that Cruz outpointed him in 1987 . And I , of course , have never believed for a second that Codrescu beat me fair and square in 1986 , spoiling my three-peat the year after I overwhelmed the subtle Zen country poet Joanne Kyger . The Transylvania-born Codrescu resorted_to a_battery of evil mind-games for the bout , arriving in a Batman sweat shirt he ' d worn a day earlier into the bat-infested depths of the Carlsbad Caverns . Like any good poetic device , Codrescu ' s shirt worked_on more_than one level . It reaffirmed his heritage , but he also knew that I would recognize the shirt as having once belonged_to a mutual friend , a young poet named Jeffrey Miller who ' d accidentally killed himself by wrapping his car around a redwood tree on the way back to his birthday_party from a liquor_store . I ' ve given poetry readings in the United States and Europe , in grade_schools and colleges , in museums , theaters and bars , in front of thousands and in front of two , but nothing I ' ve experienced is so naked , so pressure-filled , as a championship poetry fight . People listen so intently you can hear their minds whir . Late in the match against Codrescu , I fell_apart . I knew I was down . Desperate for a knockout , I scrapped my game_plan for a work that had wowed the judges the previous year . The fight was over . Codrescu knew it , I knew it and , worse , the judges knew it . In the first unanimous decision in championship history , I went_down in flames . 6 . The Promoters -- Early on the morning of the fight , Peter Rabbit and his partner Anne MacNaughton field telephone_calls at WPBA headquarters with the help of the organization ' s new president , a smooth-talking Tarahumara Indian poet named Amalio ( Mexican Bob ) Madueno . Up a flight of metal stairs from Zeke ' s Auto Supply , the office -- barely a desk wide -- is strewn with manuscripts , plastic foam cups and old fight posters . T-shirts celebrating past bouts hang across the only window . For the last 13 years , Rabbit and MacNaughton have been the driving force behind the WPBA and its predecessor , the Society of the Muse of the Southwest . They met in 1969 while living at Libre , a still-thriving commune in southern Colorado . Rabbit , who changed his name from Douthit many years ago , was a founder of Drop City , one of the first large-scale , geodesic-domes-out-of-rusty-car-parts ' 60s communes . The no-nonsense MacNaughton , like Rabbit , has been a poet for a long_time . &quot; People don ' t have any idea what kind of a tepee rig we ' ve got going here , &quot; she says wearily , hanging_up the phone after sparring with one of the 19 print and electronic journalists accredited for the bout , by far the largest_number ever . Since 1981 , the championship has expanded from a restaurant-bar to the Taos Civic Auditorium to the Taos Convention Center to Ramona ' s , the biggest indoor space in the area . Nobody in the WPBA collective gets paid a salary to produce the World Heavyweight Bout , the culmination of the group ' s annual Taos Poetry Circus , which this year includes eight days of workshops , readings and a daily , espresso-fueled , afternoon-long open session at the Caffe Tazza . The WPBA ' s budget is $ 20 # 000 , financed by grants from the county and local foundations and from ticket sales . Both the challenger and the champ take_home about $ 1 # 000 and expenses , hardly_a princely sum even by poetry standards . Rabbit got the idea of holding a championship in 1981 after reading about the popularity of the &quot; poetry slams &quot; that Al Simmons had been staging in Chicago lofts and nightclubs . Those slugfests began after poet Jim Desmond signaled his displeasure with a Jerome Sala reading by going_after Sala with a chair . Soon after that , they persuaded Simmons , a genial , smooth-domed poet , to come_up with a forum where they could duke it out with words . Simmons did , and sold tickets to the event . He was thrilled when Rabbit asked permission to produce a similar bout in New Mexico . Rabbit , a born impresario and indefatigable idealist , had long sought to move poetry out into the world . &quot; The older I get , the more that I think_about it , &quot; he says , &quot; my primary concern is community. &quot; 7 . The Judges -- In scoring , the WPBA championship differs crucially from the slams , which have spread beyond Chicago to bars nationwide and will be featured in the Los Angeles stop of Lollapalooza . Slams , based on the notion that poetry can -- and should -- be judged by Everyman , usually employ judges chosen at random from the bar audience . Consequently , slammers tend to read directly to the_pit , angling for bravura , one-punch knockouts . Slams often seem less like poetry events than like stand-up comedy . Or stand-up tragedy . In contrast , WPBA judges must be residents of Taos and have no &quot; erotic or commercial &quot; interest in the bout ' s outcome . Their names are never disclosed . This year ' s judges are a photographer who takes pictures of minor_league baseball , a sculptor who lives at the Taos pueblo and a secretary at the printing_company that produces the program for the bout . 8 . In Training -- On the Sunday before the June 11 bout , Troupe wound_up a series of tuneup readings with a performance , accompanied by trombonist George Lewis , at the Central Library in Downtown Los Angeles . As Lewis unlimbered his trombone and his Apple PowerBook ( which had been programmed to synthesize sounds ) , Troupe talked_about what he was doing to prepare . &quot; Reading with musicians helps make me better able to phrase , &quot; he explained . &quot; It helps me think_about the words and how I can read them and manipulate the rhythms . I ' ve been running_up and down a mountain of words . I ' m going_to beat Ortiz up. &quot; Most poets come_to the bout with the same strategy : read your best nine poems , build to a climax the way you would in a regular reading , scatter your subject_matter across the vast poetic landscape . But last year against Ntozake Shange , Ortiz fashioned a fresh approach . He elaborated on a theme -- how a man holds_on to what is his own -- with one poem commenting on and reinforcing another . At first , Ortiz seemed monochromatic against the flamboyant , theatrical Shange , but as the rounds went_by , Shange wilted under Ortiz ' s moral onslaught . Her poems -- which had seemed so sexy , confident and wise the previous year , when she ' d defeated Waldman -- began to lose their swagger . Midway through the fight , one of her black mesh stockings ripped . Under the hot lights , her lipstick began to smear like blood . Because of its open embrace of competition , the event has made some poets uncomfortable . Waldman had to be coaxed for several years before she agreed to participate ; the same with Ortiz . Over the years , masters like Allen Ginsberg , Robert Duncan and Amiri Baraka have observed the championship and even read in non-competitive prelims , but have refused to step into the ring . &quot; I think competition is always there in so-called polite literary society , &quot; says Troupe . &quot; I just think Peter Rabbit ' s been dealing with it out front . People compete for grants and for publishers . People are loath to say it , but that ' s how it is . One time I read with Ginsberg , and I went_on first . He came_up_to me at intermission and said , ' What are you trying to do , burn_down an old_man ? ' Then he took it to a whole higher level . &quot; The champ is much more ambivalent . &quot; Competition is something poetry can do without , &quot; Ortiz insists , driving north toward Taos two days before his title defense . Still , he admits , the same two poets reading one after another probably would n ' t attract a bout-sized crowd . &quot; The attention the championship gives to poetry is very important , &quot; he agrees . &quot; But poetry as individualism is a waste of time. &quot; Ortiz stares out the window at the junipers and pinyon , at the sere landscape of New Mexico that ' s so_much like his own work -- a plain surface only hinting at the richness beneath . &quot; I think the real winner should always be the people and the people ' s voice. &quot; Right before the bout I tell Troupe what Ortiz said . He ' s right , the challenger agrees , &quot; but by God , one guy wins and another guy loses. &quot; He then admits that he spread gooba dust around Ortiz ' s stool . 9 . Into the Ring -- Rabbit calls Ortiz and Troupe into the middle of the ring , then flips a coin . For the second year in a row , Ortiz loses the toss and has to read first . The ring girl , Laurien Cook , in stiletto_heels and a tight black gown , parades across the stage holding_up a sign that announces &quot; Round One. &quot; The ring girl ' s role is actually important : to clear the audience ' s palate between rounds , like crackers at a wine tasting . I scan the faces of the crowd . They ' re all types and ages : rich women in turquoise squash-blossom necklaces ; poor folks in dusty sandals ; grizzled hippies and nursing mothers ; college_students with notebooks poised ; Pueblo Indians with their hair in braids ; snowbirds looking_like they just stepped_out of their Winnebagos , and a sprinkling of kids . Last year , as he snarled out his pre-fight hype , Rabbit got so wound_up , his false teeth fell_out . Without missing a beat , he grabbed them up , waved them above his head and whipped the audience into a frenzy . Would he do_it again ? &quot; All right , &quot; Rabbit bellows , his choppers firmly in place , &quot; Let ' s R-U-M-B-L-E ! ! &quot; 10 . The Match -- Ortiz comes_out all business , firing from his new collection . &quot; Picture a man going from place to place in this country now called America , &quot; he reads , pinpointing himself in a shifting landscape , simultaneously spreading the news and on the run , fighting to keep soul and culture alive in the face of long odds . Troupe steps_up , blasting a poem about the liberation of Nelson Mandela , calling_out the big spiritual guns , voodoo priests and deities like Elegba , the god of the crossroads . As he chants &quot; go there spirit . . . Wa-Doo , ah-oom , &quot; his earring glitters and shakes . I give the first round to Troupe . The champion ' s got_to know he ' s in a battle . When Ortiz comes_out for Round Two , he hangs his purple baseball hat on a ring post to reclaim the turf . &quot; Seed , &quot; says Ortiz , pressing together his index_finger and thumb to indicate an invisible kernel . &quot; He looked_at the tiny seed for a long_time . &quot; The poem is about a man , sitting in the middle of a college campus , battling for his own sanity . &quot; When he decided to give_up poetry , it was 1 o ' clock_in the afternoon . &quot; Two members of the press mumble to each other sotto voce , and a spectator shushes them . &quot; He did not want to be swayed by the lilt of a bird somewhere . &quot; Ortiz continues . &quot; . . . and he did not want to know . . . the seed that stood before his eyes as a tiny monument . . . of new life , the beginning that would flower by his seeing. &quot; The audience explodes in applause . Next to me , a guy snaps his fingers in beatnik delight . Troupe comes_back with &quot; My Poems Have Holes Sewn into Them , &quot; but Ortiz has established the pace and tone , slowing things down the way the Knicks did_in the Eastern Conference playoffs , forcing Troupe to play his game . If Ortiz keeps this up , focusing his poet ' s eyes on the essential , he ' s going_to make the challenger look frantic , his words so_much static in the void . Round Two to Ortiz . The ring girl tickles Troupe under the chin with her feather_boa when she crosses the stage for Round Three . Ortiz goes_into his folder for another new poem , &quot; Busted Boy , &quot; written after he moved to Tucson last January . &quot; I ' m new in Tucson , but I ' m not a stranger to this scene / waiting for the bus , I don ' t look_around for plain clothes . I know they ' re waiting there in this America , they ' re here. / Waiting for busted boys , busted lives . &quot; Troupe rolls_out a similar theme , &quot; Skulls Along the River , &quot; which starts &quot; up from new_orleans on river_boats . . . . &quot; At its best , the World Heavyweight Poetry Championship is a duet , a call-and-response , with themes weaving in and out of both poets ' work that allow the audience to see the world from many different sides . Troupe leans into the microphone to whisper , &quot; We suffer because we must / there is no other way to find beauty / there is no other way to find love / we suffer because we must / there is no other way home / to find the memory. &quot; A whoop from the back of the room : &quot; You got him on the ropes , Simon ! &quot; I mark my score card 2-1 for Ortiz , as he steps to the lectern with &quot; Some Past Poems I ' ve Written , &quot; a new piece about Missoula , Mont . &quot; Where are the Indians in this crummy town ? &quot; he begins . &quot; My temptation is to go_up to the nearest white_man / and say ' Where are all_the Indians in your crummy town ? ' &quot; Quincy Troupe ' s verse is descended from preaching , from jazz and blues . Not only is it about music -- subjects include Duke Ellington , Miles Davis , Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington -- it is music . Troupe grew_up in St . Louis around musicians ; his brother was a drummer , and jazzmen like Arthur Blythe and Lester Bowie were family friends . &quot; I think the language of poetry should be uplifting , &quot; he told me at the Downtown library . &quot; I think_of the written poem as a script to be performed. &quot; Round Four belongs_to Troupe ' s &quot; River Town Packin House Blues &quot; : &quot; big tom was a black nigga man / cold &amp; black / eye say , big tom was a black nigga man / black steel flesh / standin like a gladiator / soaked in animal blood . . . &quot; Troupe ' s fingers are high above his head , wriggling with electric energy . His dreads sweep like wild-horse tails when he corkscrews his body , bends his knees and stomps out choruses in rhythms as complicated as any in hip-hop . The voice in the back of the room spoke too soon . Now it ' s 2-2 : two fine poets at the top of their form spiraling higher and higher . For Round Five , the ring girl changes into long purple gloves Ortiz ' s voice , of course , is also trained . He remembers his mother and father singing &quot; Catholic Church-type music &quot; as well as Pueblo songs , and long before he started writing , Ortiz sang country_and_western . &quot; Sand Creek , Colorado Territory 1864 , &quot; Ortiz announces quietly , invoking the U.S. Army ' s devastating attack on the Cheyenne . &quot; Acoma Pueblo , 1599 , &quot; he continues , marking the date of the Spanish onslaught against Ortiz ' s own people . &quot; My Lai , Vietnam , 1968 , &quot; he says , pausing before he launches into an improvised chant : &quot; My Lai / Oh why why ? / We know why , / why you died / Now we know why / why you die . . . &quot; The words are repeated in dozens of combinations , as his keening voice probes the connections between the massacres . Cigarette smoke has engulfed the room . People fan themselves in the heat . &quot; Sand Creek , you live_on . . . &quot; sings Ortiz , guiding his poem to a close , as a little kid yells out , &quot; Thank you. &quot; Troupe ' s Round Five poem , &quot; Las Cruces , New Mexico , &quot; which invokes Geronimo and &quot; the high , great mesas , flat as vegas gaming tables , &quot; echoes Ortiz . At the break , I have it three rounds to two , Ortiz . While Tom Tom Club and John Coltrane boom over the sound_system , I ricochet around the room with my periodista tie flapping over my shoulder , surveying the audience . I compare notes with a friend , Jack Collom , a fine poet out of Boulder , and his daughter , Sierra . Jack says he has Troupe a bit in front . Sierra is giving it to Ortiz . I talk to at least 20 other fans . It ' s a tossup . &quot; Sometimes I think that I ' ve never been sure whether I ' m a poet , &quot; Ortiz had said on the way into Taos , &quot; I don ' t understand what poetry is . Poems are all story to me . Poems should give a sense of a mythic dimension to reality , even when writing_about everyday things. &quot; I think_about this when Ortiz kicks_off Round Six with &quot; Histories , Places , Indians : Just Like Always. &quot; In the poem , Ortiz wanders down a street in New York , looking_for a place to have lunch after serving on a panel at the annual colloquium of the Modern Language Assn. , one of academia ' s most brutal meat markets , when he sees an elderly Indian leaning against a wall_in Times Square , carrying a sign &quot; Need Money to Get_Back Home to Window Rock , Navajo Nation. &quot; &quot; I approach him , say ' Yaahteh , ' holding_out my hand , smiling . The 42nd Street traffic up and down the street is ceaseless . He looks_at me , shakes his head , and ignores my hand . &quot; The Indians in the room -- there are more_than I ' ve ever seen at a bout -- nod their heads in recognition when Ortiz reads . For the first time , I realize what Troupe is up against . This is Indian country . In his half of Round Six , Troupe weighs in with his quietest and most personal work of the evening , &quot; Poem For My Father. &quot; Quincy Trouppe Sr. , who died in 1993 , was one of the best catchers ever to play in the Negro Leagues as well as the game ' s unofficial historian . &quot; father , it was an honor to be there , in the dugout / with you . . . . &quot; To the poet ( who dropped a &quot; p &quot; from his last_name ) , his father and his father ' s teammates were the harbingers of a new_world : &quot; . . . the miraculous truth sluicing through steeped &amp; disguised in the blues confluencing , like the point at the cross when a fastball hides itself up in a slider , curve breaking_down &amp; away in a wicked , sly grin curved &amp; posed as an ass-scratching uncle_tom , who like old satchel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch before coming_back with a hard , high , fast_one . . . &quot; I ' ve got_it even at the end of six . In Round Seven , the poets usually go_for the big work , the sweeping statement -- love and death -- that can blow an audience away . Instead , Ortiz staggers . With &quot; Not Knowing And Knowing , &quot; another poem / story in which the poet , surrounded by tourists , has to find his way beyond dismay to beauty , he appears to be repeating himself . I wonder if Ortiz has anything left . I have a good idea where Troupe will go_in Round Seven . I saw him electrify the crowd in L.A. with the same verse at the beginning of the week , and he has set it up perfectly with Round Six . And sure enough , it comes -- &quot; A Poem For ' Magic ' &quot; : &quot; take the sucker to the hoop , &quot; magic &quot; johnson , recreate reverse hoodoo gems off the spin , deal alley-oop-dunk-a-thon-magician passes now , double-pump , scissor , vamp through space hang_in place &amp; put it all up in the sucker ' s face , &quot; magic &quot; johnson , &amp; deal the roundball , like the juju man that you am . . . &quot; The poem embodies perfectly Troupe ' s sanctified , come-home-to-Jesus style , and the crowd goes wild . On my card , he ' s moved_into the lead , 4-3 . Ortiz needs a big poem here , and he gets_it beautifully , with a quiet lyric , written recently at Rosebud , South_Dakota , among the Sioux , which concludes : &quot; . . . It ' s this we perceive at the edge of this rainy dawn , the water trembling and gentling off the roof . It ' s this prayer which insists we notice and cannot avoid . It ' s Tuesday morning rain right now . It could be California , Pacific_Ocean clouds like horses_flying over the coastal hills , across desert valleys , over the mountains toward the Lakota prairie It could be , but right now , it ' s here , a Lakota Prayer-rain . &quot; Troupe responds with his own fine lyric , &quot; Collage , &quot; and though the round is close , I give it to Ortiz , 4-4 . But just when he ' s ready to put Troupe away , Ortiz chooses to sing another song . This one is about a man who is hauled_up before a judge and given a chance to make a statement . &quot; Yes , you honor Judge . . . You have no honor , Judge . &quot; Ortiz ' s deep voice is starting to fray . He ' s beginning to trip over his own words . Troupe roars back with &quot; Avalanche , &quot; the title poem from his next book : &quot; and i want this poem to kneel down itself before healing want it to be magic there beneath the crucifixion of light want it to be praise song , juju rooted want it to be mojo hand raised_up to powers of flight &quot; As Troupe acknowledges loud applause , the blond 4-year-old next to me turns_to his mother and says &quot; He ' s my favorite. &quot; At the end of nine , it ' s Troupe 5-4 Round 10 , the extemporaneous round , separates the men poets from the boy poets , the women from the girls . In 1992 , Anne Waldman , not a strong improviser , lost her title to Ntozake Shange in the 10th , when she croaked out a brief , panicked improvisation and abruptly sat_down . The ring girl strips_down to a G-string and a glittering halter as the poets strip to pure inspiration . Rabbit brings_out a small Santa Clara Pueblo bowl , and Ortiz reaches in . Rabbit takes the folded paper and reads it out loud -- &quot; black hat. &quot; A nervous titter runs_through the crowd . Ortiz begins almost without hesitation , pronouncing each word deliberately : &quot; ' Don ' t forget to take your black hat , ' she said , before he left . He turned_to ask foolishly what she meant . &quot; Ortiz proceeds to take us through the provenance of the hat , the history of the relationship , and an exploration of the emotions symbolized . &quot; As he reached for the black hat , she let it drop to the floor. &quot; Any borderline psychotic can string together a bunch of words from which a listener could possibly make_sense ; in the poetry world , that ' s known as &quot; turning_on the poetry machine. &quot; But Ortiz has gone much further , shaping an emotionally complicated story about the ashes of a love_affair -- from two words , on the spot . The crowd gives him a standing_ovation . Troupe comes_back strong . Working off &quot; sharkskin suit &quot; -- &quot; the man in the sharkskin suit reached_into his pocket and pulled_out a 10 &quot; -- he creates a Stagolee tale : a hustler offers a woman $ 10 to go_off with him , and she turns him down . The hoodoo syllables glitter like the silver &quot; Q.T. &quot; of his earring , but the piece doesn ' t reveal that &quot; sense of a mythic dimension to reality &quot; that Ortiz had talked_about in the car . Not even Troupe thinks he won the round . I ' ve got the fight dead even . As the lights go_up , Rabbit collects the judges ' cards and tabulates the scores . The crowd goes silent the instant he re-enters the ring . &quot; Judge Number One scores it 6-4 Ortiz. &quot; The champ ' s supporters cheer nervously . &quot; Judge Number Two calls it 7-3 for Troupe. &quot; Troupe ' s fans whoop in reply . &quot; Judge Number Three , &quot; with a look of disbelief , Rabbit clears his throat , &quot; Judge Number Three scores it 10-0 , Quincy Troupe ! The winner and the new Heavyweight Champion of the World is Quincy Troupe ! ! &quot; City Councilman Bobby Duran leaps onstage to present the trophy as the press swirls around the two contestants . &quot; I ' ve read with Ginsberg , &quot; Troupe , looking dazed and exhilarated , says to the reporters , &quot; I ' ve read with Baraka , but I ' ve never been as nervous as I was tonight. &quot; I ' m in shock . I can ' t believe a judge would give Troupe all 10 rounds . I collar Ortiz . &quot; Do you believe the people were the winner tonight ? &quot; I shout over the din . &quot; Yes , I do , &quot; he replies . Frantically , I chase_after Rabbit to complain about the scoring , but he ' s already in the center of the ring with an ecstatic grin as Ortiz and Troupe embrace . They join hands , then lift them above their heads . I look_around Ramona ' s . Wild debates have sprung_up in every corner of the room . People are alive_with poetry .</TEXT>
