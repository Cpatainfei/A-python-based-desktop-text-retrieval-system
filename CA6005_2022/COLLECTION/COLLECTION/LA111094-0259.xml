   <HEADLINE> THE COLLEGES / IRENE GARCIA ; CSUN FOOTBALL_TEAM UNDERMINING ITSELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Cal State Northridge football_team has received ample attention lately and it has nothing to do with its performance on the field . Let ' s face it , a struggling program on the verge of extinction would not merit such a spotlight . In CSUN ' s case , the attention is related to incidents off the field : rejection of a referendum , which could lead to elimination of the program , a player charged with a felony allowed to compete , and the latest . . . . Let ' s just say when the going gets_tough , Northridge football_players get going . As in walking_out . Last season the team boycotted practice , citing a growing dissatisfaction with the level of funding for the cost-containment program . On Tuesday , a handful of players , among them key starters , boycotted practice but refused to reveal why . It won ' t do any good to ask Coach Bob Burt . The coach seemed puzzled by Tuesday ' s action and said : &quot; I ' m sure I ' ll find_out when they tell me what the reasons are . I honestly don ' t know. &quot; How could a coach not know what ' s going_on with his team , especially when one player indicated that coaching was among the grievances that led to the boycott ? Another player admitted he didn ' t know what was going_on but followed the rest of the gang . Those who attended Tuesday ' s practice also said they had no idea why their teammates walked_out . Perhaps these last two cases best describe what ' s happening with the football_team at Northridge . Nobody knows what ' s going_on and the program has shifted into a state of disarray . The team already has had two big distractions this season . A starter was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted murder , causing controversy when the school allowed him to compete as if nothing had happened . Recently , the student body delivered a big blow when it voted against a controversial student-fee referendum . That rejection could result in the football program ' s elimination . Now this . One can ' t help but wonder what these players hope to accomplish with this latest action . Perhaps they think it will motivate administrators to scramble for the funding that could save the program . Or maybe they think this will arouse a sudden interest among the same student body that basically voted to get_rid_of football . Maybe they ' re looking_for sympathy . A more realistic guess is that Tuesday ' s demonstration isn ' t going_to help the players ' cause . In fact , the incident will probably work against the football program . It probably will assure the students who rejected the referendum that they made the right decision . Who needs a program that brings the school so_much bad publicity ? Burt guessed on Tuesday that perhaps the latest incident was related to players ' frustration with the team ' s problem-plagued season and 3-5 record . That would make CSUN football_players losers , on and off the field . If you can ' t win , might as well quit . In these tough financial times , who wants to spend extra money to fund a team infested with losers ? If it survives the athletic department ' s drastic financial problems , the Northridge football_team should find a better way to gain attention . Perhaps demonstrating a winning attitude , both on and off the field , would be a start . Another suggestion : Improve the lines of communication between the coach and his athletes . That way he ' ll know what ' s going_on with his team , for a change .</TEXT>
