   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : VAN NUYS ; ON-RAMP TO INTERNET BEING BUILT AT MAGNET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s no big orange sign to mark it , but the first on-ramp to the information superhighway from a San Fernando Valley public_school is under construction at one of the Los Angeles district ' s newest magnet schools . Teachers and coordinators at Grant High_School ' s communication technology magnet are spending the summer setting_up computers and putting_together a curriculum that will introduce students to global communication through Internet . &quot; I am very excited about it , &quot; said Ellis Kaufman , coordinator of the new magnet . &quot; We are out there , pioneering something. &quot; The 180-student magnet , one of 10 new magnet schools in the Valley , will also focus_on radio , television and video production . No other schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District have formal programs to use Internet already in place , according to the district ' s information technology division . But Garfield High_School in Los Angeles and a new magnet at the Los Angeles Public_Library are starting similar programs this year , and will serve as models for future districtwide communication programs . The district is awaiting word on an application for a $ 2.4-million federal grant to link 26 high_schools to Internet . &quot; What we really want to do is to have all teachers and students have access to Internet , &quot; said Andy Rogers , a coordinator for the information technology division . The magnet program at Grant in Van Nuys will feature a 20-computer lab and up_to eight computers in each of six classrooms , linked together so that students can share information from different classes . &quot; What we want to do is expose our students to all_of these technologies so they can function in a global community , &quot; Kaufman said . &quot; Students on the high_school level are just not being prepared for that new world. &quot; There are more_than 100 spaces open for ninth- and 10th-graders at the Grant magnet , which is housed on the campus of Grant High . For information , call ( 818 ) 781-1400 . SUSAN BYRNES</TEXT>
