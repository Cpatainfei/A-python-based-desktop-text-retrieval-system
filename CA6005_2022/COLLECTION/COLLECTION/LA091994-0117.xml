   <HEADLINE> EMOTIONS RUN HIGH IN PROP . 187 DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Opponents say if Proposition 187 passes , school officials and doctors and social_service agencies will , in_effect , become agents for the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Skin_colors and last_names will become suspect and lead to discrimination . About 300 # 000 students in public_schools could be turned_out , and $ 15 billion in federal funds could be lost and disease go untreated . But the other side says that if the state ballot measure is approved in November , public education will improve because there will be fewer students and more teachers per classroom . There will , these people say , be a smooth transition for illegal immigrant students not entitled to an education -- they won ' t be kicked_out immediately , if they are kicked_out at all . What ' s more , there is no way the federal_government will withhold funds to so large and powerful a state as California . Those were the arguments Sunday night at an emotionally charged forum at St . Mark Presbyterian_Church . An estimated 150 people showed_up to learn more about the controversial initiative by questioning a five-member panel , including proposition co-author Ron Prince . The so-called Save Our State initiative , which would bar illegal immigrants from attending public_schools and deny them non-emergency health_care and social_services , has been called racist by many who oppose it . But Bill King , a former INS official of 37 years and one of the panel members , said : &quot; I keep_on hearing it ' s a racist issue , which is vexing to me . It ' s not about ancestry ; it ' s about illegal behavior . Those who say the proposition is racist . . . well , that ' s just a crutch to lean on. &quot; Racially motivated or not , Proposition 187 would do nothing to solve the state ' s illegal immigration woes , its opponents agreed , because most immigrants come for jobs first , not benefits . The measure could also lead to greater health_problems by denying illegal immigrants immunizations , said Dr. Robert T . Miner , a panelist and member of the Orange County Medical Assn . &quot; Disease is 100 % nonpartisan , and it has no respect for borders , &quot; he said . &quot; Even killer_bees don ' t respect our borders . Proposition 187 is the wrong prescription for a serious disease . But if you don ' t allow me to treat the little illegal alien now , I ' m going_to be treating people inside your homes. &quot; But Prince , a Tustin accountant , said it is wiser_to start denying health_care to illegal immigrants now rather than later . &quot; The good doctor ( Miner ) is living_in an ideal world where we try to treat every patient , &quot; Prince said . &quot; But the state health_care system is already strained and overburdened . It may be a hard choice to deny health_care now , but the situation is bad and it ' s getting worse. &quot; Mary Hornbuckle , a panelist and a Costa Mesa City_Council member who opposes the proposition , said the initiative wouldcost taxpayers in future legal challenges , if the voters approve it . that ' s exactly what happened to the city of Costa Mesa , she said , when it tried to stop the influx of illegal immigrants by challenging federal laws in court . &quot; It may be great politics , &quot; she said of the initiative . &quot; But it ' s bad public policy. &quot; Mitchell Valbuena of Costa Mesa stood_up and told the panelists in favor of the proposition that they had everything turned_around . &quot; Illegal immigrants don ' t cost us money -- they make us money and they save us money with their cheap labor , &quot; he said . But Barbara Coe , a co-chairperson for the California Coalition for Immigration Reform , said : &quot; This is a nation of laws , and people must abide_by them . If we had the money and the wherewithal , we ' d happily educate the children and medicate the children and put them in beautiful homes . But we don ' t have the money. &quot;</TEXT>
