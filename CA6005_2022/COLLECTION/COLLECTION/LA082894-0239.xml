   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 38th state Senate District . They are Democrat Thomas Berry of Laguna Hills , Libertarian August Anderson of Encinitas , Peace &amp; Freedom candidate Mary Ann Nikl of Carlsbad and Republican William A . Craven , the incumbent , of Oceanside . Here ' s where they stand on four issues . &quot; Three Strikes &quot; Crime Law Berry : &quot; An alternative might be a boot camp for all Californians between the ages of 19 and 22 who are not in higher education . The camp could be paid_for by parents , the state and federal government. &quot; Anderson : &quot; I favor the ideal behind the ' three strikes ' law . However , I believe the law as written is our elected officials ' feeble attempt to put a bandage on a broken arm . Criminals found guilty of violent crimes should serve full sentences without parole . However , this law does not fix the underlying problems that exist within the entire criminal justice system . The entire system needs an overhaul. &quot; Nikl : &quot; I oppose the ' three strikes ' law . It violates the freedom judges must have to ensure that the punishment is proportional to the crime . Violent crime is actually down . Crime hysteria is up and the ' three strikes ' law feeds that hysteria . It is no coincidence that the U.S. has the highest percentage in the world of citizens being imprisoned and the lowest academic test scores of any industrialized country . ' Three strikes ' will fill_up prisons while draining billions of dollars that can be used for social programs . I favor lighter sentences and more money for education. &quot; Craven : &quot; I favor the law . I firmly believe tougher penalties act_as a deterrent . Endless appeals and the lack of punishment have only exacerbated our crime situation. &quot; Save Our State Initiative to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants Berry : &quot; California needs to secure the international border and should end economic incentives for people to cross the border seeking work. &quot; Anderson : &quot; Again , the S.O.S. law is a minor attempt at fixing a major problem , but it is philosophically a step_in the right direction . The entire welfare system needs to be virtually eliminated . The United States Constitution does not create ' entitlements ' for anyone . We need to fix the underlying source of all these problems , not just treat the symptoms on a piece-by-piece basis after the problems have reached emergency status . Nikl : &quot; All immigrants , including undocumented workers , provide benefits to the economy by doing_work that Americans are unwilling or unable to do . At both ends of the spectrum , immigrants fill a void : In math and sciences , Americans are behind ; at the low end , Americans won ' t do needed work for low pay . Californians need to know that people immigrate to other places when their way of living is destroyed by big corporations and farmers are forced to look_for a way to feed their families. &quot; Craven : &quot; I favor SOS . By definition , illegal immigrants are here without the acquiescence of government and therefore should have no expectations of receiving government services . Stricter border enforcement is essential , but the issue is largely within the purview of the federal_government . If the federal_government mandates services by the states , then federal matching dollars must be made available. &quot; Single-Payer Health Initiative Berry : &quot; I would like to see health_care for all Americans and reduce the cost of health care. &quot; Anderson : &quot; The answers to these first three questions take far more_than 100 words each to address . I would suggest that if a reader really wanted to understand all_the issues , problems and solutions facing our state and our nation today , they should read my book ' Bridge Over Troubled Waters ' ( penned under the name Rasputin ) . &quot; Nikl : &quot; I favor the single-payer health plan . It will save billions of dollars that under the present system are wasted by allowing insurance_companies to run an inefficient system that requires an enormous administrative bureaucracy . I favor full universal coverage for all with an emphasis on preventive health_care . I believe that if all other industrialized countries can provide health_care for all their citizens , we must do the same . Do not forget that Medicare is an efficient government-run system. &quot; Craven : &quot; I oppose it . It ' s been estimated that the combined cost would be greater than the entire state ' s budget . Further , a comprehensive solution is needed on a federal rather than state-by-state basis . Otherwise , California invariably becomes a health-care magnet for residents of other states in search of health care. &quot; Future Uses for El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Berry : &quot; The El Toro base should be used as a regional park or as a desalination facility selling water to California. &quot; Anderson : &quot; The El Toro base is not within my district and it would take a significant amount of research along with an understanding of the people ' s views within that jurisdiction to be able to answer that question from such a distance . However , in_general I believe that military facilities that no longer serve a military purpose should be put to the highest and best civilian use. &quot; Nikl : &quot; I oppose an airport at the El Toro base . This facility was bought with tax dollars and it would be unfair to continue subsidizing big business . If the airlines want another airport , let them build one with their own money . The facility should be converted to a park and recreation area for public use . Runways can be converted into ball courts , biking and running trails . Undeveloped areas could be used as a green belt by planting trees that all citizens can enjoy. &quot; Craven : &quot; It is premature to develop a plan for El Toro until the Base Reuse Authority studies are completed . El Toro represents a unique asset . Decisions as_to future use deserves careful consideration after all options have been presented. &quot; Source : Individual candidates ; Researched by ERIC BAILEY / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
