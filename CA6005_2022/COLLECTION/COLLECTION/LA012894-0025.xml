   <HEADLINE> $ 50 MILLION RELEASED FOR ROAD REPAIRS ; REBUILDING : INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDS WILL ALLOW RECONSTRUCTION TO CONTINUE AROUND THE CLOCK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration released $ 50 million in emergency earthquake assistance Thursday to keep construction crews working around the clock to clear debris and repair damaged highways in Southern California . &quot; We don ' t want them to stop for a second , &quot; Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena told a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing . &quot; We want to provide funding to allow them to continue reconstruction &quot; of the major highway structures damaged in the Jan . 17 quake . The announcement brings the amount of transportation money provided_for emergency repairs_to $ 95 million since the Northridge quake . Under federal law a maximum $ 100 million in emergency funds is available until Congress approves the Administration ' s $ 6.6-billion aid package for quake victims . The package includes $ 1.35 billion to repair roads and bridges . At the hearing , called by Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , Pena said arrangements were being made to add 25 locomotives and train cars to accommodate commuters riding the Metrolink system . Pena said he was also working_on securing federal waivers to increase the average speed of Metrolink trains from 25 m.p.h. to 30 m.p.h. on the route between Palmdale and Los Angeles . * Pena emphasized that the long-term plan to rebuild the Los Angeles area ' s transportation network must include efforts to persuade as_many commuters as possible to park their cars and use mass transit . Ridership on the Metrolink system has jumped since the quake . &quot; We are asking the people to reconsider their transportation alternatives , &quot; Pena said . &quot; We have to find a way in this process to ensure that when construction is finished this ridership is maintained. &quot; Pena estimated that it would take six months to a year to rebuild damaged highways , which he called a vital link in &quot; restoring the flow of commerce from the Pacific Coast to the rest of the nation. &quot; Earlier in the day , the Senate Public Works Committee passed_on a voice vote Boxer ' s proposal that would make highway bridges eligible for federal funds to cover earthquake retrofitting . Under current law , a freeway structure must be damaged before it is eligible for federal funds . Although the proposal would not set_aside any federal money to retrofit California freeways , Boxer called it a necessary first_step . Boxer said she and Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) are optimistic that California House Republicans will not delay an effort to quickly pass the $ 6.6-billion aid package by insisting that the spending be offset by budget_cuts . * Both California senators were assured by Sen . Harry M . Reid ( D-Nev. ) that Congress does not regard the earthquake as a California problem . &quot; This is a problem we have to face as a nation . We have to get ready . There will be more earthquakes , &quot; he said . Next week the Senate will assess relief operations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development at a committee hearing called by Sen . Barbara A . Mikulski ( D-Md. ) .</TEXT>
