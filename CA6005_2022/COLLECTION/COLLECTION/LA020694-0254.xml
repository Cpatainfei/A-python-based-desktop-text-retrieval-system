   <HEADLINE> TESTING THE LIMITS ; THANKS TO BOLD NEW TECHNOLOGY , A WOMAN CAN GIVE_BIRTH IN HER 40S , 50S AND 60S . BUT SHOULD SHE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are careers to juggle , toys to avoid stepping_on , earaches to have treated and play dates to arrange . The diapers mount_up , and so do the bills from the baby-sitter and the pediatrician . Most days , Lynn Grossman-Getoff and her husband , Peter Getoff , are so busy caring_for 15-month-old Emily that they give little thought to the fact that they arrived_at parenthood at an age -- and via a route -- that trouble some people . But sometimes , reality hits_home . &quot; You are dealing with so many stages of life at one time that it ' s disorienting , to say the least , &quot; Grossman-Getoff said . &quot; You ' re dealing with all_the issues of a young mother -- and , at_the_same_time , menopause. &quot; Using eggs donated by a younger_woman , Grossman-Getoff , a West Los Angeles family therapist , gave_birth when she was almost 45 -- six years older than her husband , a social_worker . She is_well aware that her age by no means thrusts her into the book-of-records category for first-time mothers , a distinction held by a 61-year-old Italian . Still , by using ovum transfer and high_technology to conceive when her own body was at a stage called perimenopausal , Grossman-Getoff entered an arena where science is dueling with physiology -- and where , at the moment , no one is quite sure who is winning . Donor eggs and bold new procedures that prepare an aging uterus for pregnancy are enabling women to test the biological limits of maternity . Doctors in this field stress that such procedures are still new and are by no means widespread , with only 50 to 75 babies born to post-menopausal women around the world in the last three years . But , they concede , sacred societal notions about motherhood are suddenly on the line . The issue came_to prominence not long ago when a 59-year-old British woman went public with the fact that she had just given_birth to healthy full-term twins . Her announcement added fuel to the debate about high-tech reproduction : If men can embark_on parenthood at any age , shouldn ' t women have the same option ? Is a post-menopausal woman physically capable of raising an infant ? Will she live to see her child grow_up ? Does a child get a fair shake in a household where Parents magazine arrives alongside Modern Maturity ? To Dr. Mark V . Sauer , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at USC who is among the leading specialists in egg-donor pregnancies , such questions reduce to a matter of individual choice between a patient and her physician . &quot; If we have reproductive choice in this country and we have technology that works , &quot; Sauer said , &quot; then why deny the choice ? &quot; But another pioneer in post-menopausal pregnancy , Dr. Ricardo Asch of the University of California , Irvine , said that even though his clinic imposes no age limit for what are sometimes called third-party pregnancies , some kind of guidelines are needed . &quot; In the case of using egg donations for someone who underwent normal menopause , you ' re not treating pathology , &quot; said Asch , a dean at UC Irvine ' s School_of_Medicine . &quot; You ' re just challenging physiology , the normal events that happen to a human_being . &quot; I have mixed feelings about this , I really do , &quot; Asch said . Not surprisingly , parents who have benefited from ART , or assisted reproductive technology , are not so ambivalent . Working through the technological steps that saw his sperm mixed with a donor ' s eggs , then inserted into his wife ' s womb , required &quot; a certain stamina , &quot; Peter Getoff recalled . &quot; There was so_much at stake , and there was a sense of unreality to it. &quot; But in a culture where &quot; we mess with Mother Nature in lots of other ways , &quot; many people still cling_to &quot; some very rigid and idealized notions about how things should be in terms of motherhood , &quot; Getoff said . &quot; For me , I just have very strong feelings that a woman has a right to have a child fairly late in life. &quot; Getoff and his wife are unusual among ovum-donor parents interviewed by The Times in that they readily agreed to be quoted by name and were comfortable revealing their ages . More typical was the 49-year-old mother in the San Francisco area who asked that she be called &quot; Laura &quot; and that her husband , 62 , be referred to as &quot; Sid. &quot; These are made-up names ; Laura said she was worried about personal security , adding that when she discusses post-menopausal reproduction on television , she does not disclose her real name or hometown . What is true is that Laura and Sid were married for 30 years before they became parents . Married young , they dreamed of a big family , six kids at least . But nature failed to cooperate . No specific cause could be isolated for their failure to conceive , making treatment a challenge . The couple went_through seven cycles of in_vitro fertilization . They tried a procedure in which a fertilized egg is inserted directly into a woman ' s Fallopian tube . Again , no luck . There were other treatments , such_as hormone injections and intrauterine injection of Sid ' s sperm into Laura . &quot; Nothing worked . We never even got a nibble , &quot; Laura said . Laura was_well into her 40s by the time she was ready to consider adoption . She found the process troubling . &quot; Adoption takes so_long , &quot; she said . &quot; And you have to sell yourself , like a product. &quot; Nevertheless , Laura and Sid had adopted a baby boy when they received a call from their fertility specialist , Dr. Geoffrey Sher . &quot; It was December , 1991 , and egg donation wasn ' t being talked_about , &quot; Laura recalled . &quot; But they said they were having a lot of success . So I said sure. &quot; Three months later , Laura was pregnant after her first attempt at receiving a donated egg . &quot; It took me three months before I really believed it , &quot; Laura said . &quot; I kept doing home pregnancy tests , just to make sure. &quot; That child , a boy , is now a year old , and Laura is trying to become pregnant again . Sher , whose Pacific Fertility Center has clinics throughout California , cites remarkable success rates for pregnancies attained through egg transfers . More_than half of his clinic ' s donor-egg recipients are post-menopausal , Sher said , noting that menopause normally occurs between 40 and 55 . But regardless of the age of the recipient , &quot; assuming she has a healthy uterus and the donor is under age 35 , &quot; Sher said , the birth_rate per attempted embryo transfer is 56 % . Hormone preparations enhance the &quot; friendliness &quot; of an older uterus , Sher said . A notable example is a 53-year-old patient_of his from Central Europe , who is now in her second post-menopausal pregnancy . Because egg donation is illegal in her country , that patient would not permit her name or the country she resides in to be used in this article . But in a telephone_interview , she and her husband said they had tried_for many years to have children by more conventional means . They said they ignored the reproachful relatives and friends who chastised that they would be in their 70s when their children entered college . &quot; Listen , we are very healthy . We don ' t look the age we are . And you can die also at 35 , &quot; the woman said . Her husband , 55 , sloughed off concerns that he might not live to see his grandchildren : &quot; Ah , but that could happen also if I had a child at 35. &quot; Age is relative , this couple insisted . In birthing classes to prepare_for the arrival of their daughter 10 months ago , for example , it was the younger parents who were uncomfortable in their presence -- not the other way around , they said . &quot; If the relationship with the child is good , age doesn ' t matter anyhow , &quot; the woman said . &quot; I remember when I was a very young child , I thought anyone who was 20 was terribly old . At 40 , I thought they were dead. &quot; Although Sher has not been confronted with patients in their 60s or 70s who are seeking to become pregnant , he believes strongly that physicians cannot arbitrarily draw an age line . &quot; We do not discriminate on the basis of_age , marital_status or sexual preference , &quot; he said . &quot; What we are here to do is to responsibly enhance the human condition , using technology to enhance that condition . We ' re here to help people have families. &quot; But even some of Sher ' s own patients falter in the face of time . Laura , for one , has decided not to try_for any more pregnancies after her 50th birthday . Still , she supports other women in her age_group who might decide to push beyond that limit . &quot; I think people should mind their own business , &quot; Laura said . &quot; If people want to have a baby in their 50s , they ' re going to raise that child . No one is asking them to do_it . Just the fact that you want to have a baby at that age tells me you ' re not an old 50. &quot; But 50 remains the magic_number , the age when an unseen buzzer goes_off and people get edgy about pregnancy . In many circles , a 49-year-old pregnant woman is a source of amazement , a miracle of human fecundity , while a 50-year-old in maternity clothes is more likely to be viewed_as a grotesque curiosity . &quot; There is a psychological barrier at 50 , &quot; agreed Carole Lieber-Wilkins , a West Los Angeles psychotherapist who counsels couples undergoing fertility treatment . &quot; But that used to be 40 . Now it ' s really common for 40-year-olds to be having their first children. &quot; Anne Adams , a New York journalist who until recently published a newsletter geared to older parents , predicted that as egg donation becomes more common , 50 will seem less significant . &quot; As science and people ' s desires to procreate collide to push the age frontiers out , it seems to push what we regard_as old parents further out on the timeline , &quot; Adams said . &quot; I ' m not saying people will ever stop scratching their heads at a 58-year-old woman who wants to experience pregnancy , and I still don ' t think most people are going_to opt to get pregnant at 60 , &quot; she said . &quot; But I think the shock value will wear off. &quot; But Sher maintains that questioning the motives of a 50-year-old woman who wants to have a child is a reflection of outdated values . &quot; It just so happens that women lose their fertility over the age of 40 for reasons that applied when the life span was 50 , not 70 , &quot; Sher said . The 55-year cutoff age that he has imposed at his Los Angeles clinic is arbitrary , USC ' s Sauer said . &quot; It ' s simply that my comfort level gets stretched beyond that , because I do have a problem with longevity issues. &quot; Sauer said 18 of the 29 women older than 50 whom he has worked with since 1990 have become pregnant . One 51-year-old had triplets , Sauer said ; a 55-year-old patient gave_birth to twins . Yet the novelty element of this kind of parenthood is clear even to Sauer : &quot; Every time we take_on a 50-year-old , to me I still think_of it as experimental. &quot; In the view of UC Irvine ' s Asch , the uncharted nature of this technological territory is cause for concern . Asch has performed embryo transfers on women older than 50 . He has also used the procedure to aid much younger_women who wished to become pregnant but experienced premature ovarian failure . &quot; Technology so far is dictating &quot; reproductive age limits , Asch said . &quot; That is where we need to examine where we are going_with all this. &quot; Scientific progress is one thing , Asch said . &quot; But from there to say that there should be no limits at all to reproductive freedom is a mistake . I think we need guidelines . We need to agree to limits , as a society , and among the medical community. &quot; But for those contemplating such procedures , the limits may be more pragmatic . High-tech pregnancies are expensive and generally little if any of these costs are covered by insurance . Lynn Grossman-Getoff estimated the cost of conceiving Emily at about $ 12 # 000 -- high enough that she is not sure she can afford another such pregnancy . Financial constraints have been a major concern for another of Sauer ' s patients , who asked that her identity be disguised . &quot; Fran Jones , &quot; as this 44-year-old , unmarried attorney from Sacramento asked to be called , said her earlier attempts at pregnancy -- using her own eggs and donor-inseminated sperm -- cost her about $ 3 # 500 per attempt . Since her projected success rate using that method was only about 5 % to 10 % , Jones said she turned_to a younger sister for an ovum donation . &quot; You continue to read these stories about these 59-year-old ladies who ' ve had twins , and you figure why not give it a shot , &quot; she said . Besides , she added , &quot; I guess I ' ve always wanted to be pregnant . I ' ve always wanted to have my own baby . I would have preferred to do_it the more traditional way , but it didn ' t happen to me. &quot; Relationship after relationship failed to work_out , Jones said . Before she knew it , she was 41 and worried that her childbearing years were winding down . That description squares with stories psychotherapist Lieber-Wilkins said she has heard time and again in her counseling work . &quot; Part of the myth that really gets me is this idea that women have just kind of postponed pregnancy because of their careers , &quot; Lieber-Wilkins said . &quot; The truth is , most of the women in my practice have been going_through infertility treatment for years. &quot; Many of these women have similar profiles as Jones -- women who had never met &quot; the right man &quot; or a man willing to have children at_the_same_time they were . So women of 40 and older who seek_out high-tech reproductive options are probably not doing_it as a lark , Lieber-Wilkins said . &quot; The very nature of high-tech reproduction doesn ' t allow_for frivolity , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s expensive , it ' s time-consuming , it ' s grueling on your body -- and it ' s hard on a relationship. &quot; Should the process succeed , the struggle to become pregnant may pale in the face of raising a child in a world that is not accustomed to vintage parents . &quot; They ' re walking in the dark , &quot; said Christi Taylor-Jones , the author of &quot; Midlife Parenting &quot; ( Veracity Press ) . &quot; There are no role models. &quot; Older parents may seek to dismiss the age issue , Taylor-Jones said , &quot; but the reality is that they may_not be alive when their kids have kids . They may be old and healthy -- but they may also be ill and elderly , and their kids are going_to have to take_care of them , just at the point when they ' re getting their own lives launched. &quot; As the editor of a short-lived magazine called &quot; Over-30 Parenting , &quot; Taylor-Jones , of Los Angeles , said she talked to many older mothers who reported intense feelings of isolation . &quot; They were a kind of island . Their friends their own age either had grown kids , teen-agers or no kids , &quot; she said . And while &quot; 20-year-old mothers often defer to their own parents &quot; for information , most older mothers and fathers felt uneasy soliciting guidance from their elderly parents . Taylor-Jones also found that older parents often came face to face with complicated expectations that did not mesh with the reality of raising children at any age . &quot; They think because they are older that they really ought to be able to do this thing called parenting , &quot; she said . &quot; But parenting is sort of like an earthquake . No one is prepared_for it. &quot; Earthquakes are touchy subjects in Southern California these days . But at Sauer ' s office , near USC , temblors have earned a spot in the folklore of high-tech medicine . One of Sauer ' s patients , Jones , the 44-year-old attorney , recalled that her first attempt at embryo transfer took_place the morning of Jan . 17 , only hours after the 6.6 Richter-scale quake that jolted Los Angeles . As she left the hospital following the procedure , Jones said , Sauer gave her an affable smile . &quot; If this one works , &quot; Sauer told her , &quot; we ' ll have to remember to shake all our eggs up in the future. &quot; Maybe a sense_of_humor goes_with the turf in the sphere of assisted reproduction . In Central Europe , the 55-year-old first-time father has vowed that the first compound phrase he will teach his daughter is : &quot; That is not my grandpapa . That is my papa. &quot;</TEXT>
