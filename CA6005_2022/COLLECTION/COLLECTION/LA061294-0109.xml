   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; BUT HOW WERE GERMANS VICTIMS OF NAZI AGGRESSION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the end of the Cold_War , the Age of Anxiety seems to be over . Unhappily , though , the Age of Rubbish appears to have replaced it . One chief characteristic of this new age is the creation of oppor tunistic and self-serving historical concoctions , linkages and comparisons that obfuscate historical reality . The most recent exercise along these lines revolves_around whether Germany should have been represented at the D-day commemorations . The argument goes that Germany , too , was &quot; liberated &quot; by the Allied armies , is now a full-fledged member of the Western Alliance and has come_to be the kind of democracy for which the invading forces on the Normandy beachheads fought and died . As Susan Eisenhower and other American policy analysts have demonstrated , this position is not the exclusive property of some German politicians eager to drown the past in a sea of communal sentimentality on Omaha Beach . What makes such an appalling idea possible ? The current craze for &quot; victimhood &quot; certainly has much to do with it . For understandable reasons , postwar Germans were prone to think_of themselves as victims . Emphasizing their status as victims was probably a necessary way for Germans to cope_with the unbearable regime of Adolf Hitler and the involvement of so many in its misdeeds . Generals could complain that they and their troops were victims of Hitler ' s megalomania and military incompetence . Businessmen could claim they were victims of the Nazi state ' s dominance of the economy and violations of the rules of economics . Doctors could claim they were victims of the regime ' s bizarre racial ideas and disdain for medical standards . Professors could claim they were victims of the Nazi takeover of the universities . More recently , there has been a growing literature inside and outside Germany on the plight of the millions of Germans expelled by the Czechs and Poles in ethnic cleansing that took_place in the Sudetenland and parts of Germany taken_over by Poland in 1945 , the large_number of rapes committed by Russian troops as they occupied Germany and the mistreatment of German POWs in 1945-1946 . Obviously , these are historical events that must_not be neglected . But what gets lost in these waves of assaults on the beachhead of memory is the fundamental distinction between those who perpetrated the war , with its horrors , and those who were victims of Nazi aggression . German troops did not occupy most of Europe and cause millions of deaths by invitation , and the price paid by Germans must be seen in its real historical context . D-day was not intended to liberate Germany but rather Germany ' s victims . Its success probably saved Germany from being the victim of the first atomic_bomb . Using the bomb would have appeared a welcome alternative to launching a second invasion . For that , we should all be thankful , just as we should be appreciative of Germany ' s extraordinary achievements since 1945 and its efforts to come_to terms with its past . D-day , however , was an Allied victory , and a post-modernist fog of free-wheeling &quot; interpretation &quot; should not be allowed to descend on it . The defeated German enemy soldiers of 1944 cannot be represented by the German friends of today as participants in our victory . As the late and great German historian Thomas Nipperdey argued , one should accord to history that which belongs_to it . The great battle on those beaches was not some noisy and regrettable way station on_the_road to the current happy state of affairs , and the German troops in Normandy were not greeting our assaulting troops with towels to dry_up and Wurstchen . The Germans put_up a ferocious resistance , and it is hard to imagine that any expected to return for a D-day commemoration a half-century later and celebrate with the men they were trying to drive_back into the sea . The outcome of the battle was anything but certain . Gen . Omar N . Bradley actually thought the invasion was a failure during its initial phase . Furthermore , the success of the invasion in no way destroyed the morale of the German army , which fought with extraordinary tenacity for a terrible cause right through the Battle_of_the_Bulge at the end of 1944 . The German army was not at that time preparing itself for membership in the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Some of Nazi Germany ' s political and military_leaders even entertained the hope that the alliance between the Western powers and the Soviet_Union would break_up and there would be a joint effort against the Soviets . In fact , Germany ' s leaders still had plans for victory in 1944-1945 . The Russians were not doing as well against the Germans in 1944 as they had in 1943 , while the Germans had the benefit of a consolidated front in the East . The V-1 and V-2 rockets were launched against England in the summer of 1944 , and a new U-boat offensive was planned . The air war against Germany had failed to stop war production , and the Nazi leadership was ready to call_up its last reserves . It is simply unhistorical , therefore , to talk_about &quot; liberating &quot; Germany in 1944-1945 . There could only be one goal -- defeating Germany and imposing an unconditional surrender . The success of D-day , after all , opened the way not only to Paris and Berlin , but also to Dachau and the other sites of Nazi horror that the invading armies were to discover . Therefore , to speak_of liberating Auschwitz and of liberating Germany in the same breath is blasphemous . The cynical notion of an alliance between Nazi Germany and the Western Allies against the Soviet_Union was totally unrealistic -- not only because of the Allies common interest in preventing German domination of Europe , but also because of the vileness of the Nazi regime . It is precisely the character of the regime for which the German troops at Normandy fought that makes_it impossible to engage in a joint celebration of the landing today . Normandy is not like battle_of_Verdun during World_War I -- where hundreds of thousands of soldiers died as victims of a great historical rivalry now buried with them . Whatever its faults , the Germany that fought the First_World_War was no more like Nazi Germany than the Germany of today . And Germany today is not the product of a German victory over National_Socialism but of an Allied victory over Nazi Germany . That is a historical reality that needs to be understood by Germans and by everyone else in assessing what can be and cannot be appropriately commemorated in common. *</TEXT>
