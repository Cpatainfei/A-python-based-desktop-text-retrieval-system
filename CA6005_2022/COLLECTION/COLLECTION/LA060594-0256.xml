   <HEADLINE> NORMA DEAREST ; FAYE DUNAWAY BECAME A STAR JUST AS ' OLD HOLLYWOOD ' WAS DISAPPEARING . WITH THAT PERSPECTIVE , WHO BETTER TO PLAY NORMA DESMOND , THE GREATEST STAR OF THEM ALL ? SHE ' S READY TO RISK THE DRIVE ON ' SUNSET BOULEVARD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Norma Desmond , aging silent screen star in &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; the advent of talking pictures spelled the end of her career . Faye Dunaway saw Hollywood unofficially relieve her of her movie-star crown in the 1980s as she entered her 40s ; looking_back , she said she sometimes feared her own career might take Norma Desmond ' s downward spiral . Rather than face that crisis , in the early ' 80s she headed to England with son Liam and then-husband Terry O ' Neill , spending nearly a decade away from the aggressive youth culture of the United States . Although she made occasional transatlantic treks to take roles in U.S. productions , she remained a virtual expatriate for most of the ' 80s . Now 53 -- three years past Norma Desmond ' s age in &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; -- Dunaway is getting ready to face one of her biggest career challenges . A month ago , she was named to replace Glenn Close on July 5 in her critically acclaimed role as Norma Desmond in the Los Angeles production of Andrew Lloyd Webber ' s musical &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; based on Billy Wilder ' s 1950 film_starring Gloria Swanson . Despite her escape to England , Dunaway always kept a hand in the U.S. film scene , taking occasional film roles , and doing plenty of work in television . Among her many TV credits was the critically acclaimed 1989 TV movie &quot; Cold Sassy Tree &quot; for TNT cable . She stayed big . It was the screen that got small . * Now Dunaway has gone_back to doing things big . She has landed one of the juiciest musical stage roles for women past ingenue age . Despite having no professional singing experience , Dunaway was the winner out of an illustrious list of candidates rumored to include Meryl Streep , Diahann Carroll , Shirley MacLaine , Diana Ross , Raquel Welch -- and even Zsa Zsa Gabor . Dunaway now is busily training her voice in marathon sessions with vocal coach Bob Corff , and for the moment , she refuses to let outsiders hear her sing . Dunaway said that , with a_few additions , she will wear the same sumptuous Anthony Powell wardrobe Close wears in the show , but said she may go &quot; bigger &quot; with the character , and added that she has been in discussions with Lloyd Webber about how to make the character her own . &quot; I won ' t be Swanson , I can ' t be Swanson , I ' m gonna be me , &quot; she said . &quot; But , maybe , it ' s going_to be closer to what they did_in the movie than what ' s currently being done onstage -- I don ' t quite know yet . &quot; But I ' ve already evolved certain things in terms of_age , and ( a desire to create ) a kind of gossamer thing about her . Anthony has already given me more veils , more_than I can play with , so there ' s illusion and reality -- there ' s a face , but it ' s hidden. &quot; Since it opened in London a year ago , the show has been a constant source of rumors . Patti LuPone , who portrayed the role in London and was originally signed for Broadway , got some negative reviews -- leading to speculation that Close , not LuPone , would go_to Broadway . Initially , Lloyd Webber and LuPone , as well as Close herself , denied it , but now LuPone has been paid_off , and Close is packing her bags for New York . Dunaway often turned_up in gossip columns as a contender , but then so did many others . &quot; Every time someone else ' s name was mentioned in the gossip columns , I ' d get a_hundred phone messages saying , ' Oh , I ' m so sorry , ' &quot; Dunaway said with a frustrated laugh during a recent conversation over breakfast at the Hotel Bel Air . &quot; But it ' s because this is such an event , you know ? I want to send a note to Glenn that says , this is because of you and Andrew ( Lloyd Webber ) , who have made this such an event that people are just sort of . . . nuts ! &quot; Dunaway said that , like any woman faced with getting older in Hollywood , she empathizes more_than a little with the desperately fading Norma Desmond . Despite a career highlighted by acclaimed films such_as 1967 ' s &quot; Bonnie and Clyde , &quot; which launched her career , 1974 ' s &quot; Chinatown &quot; and the 1976 &quot; Network , &quot; for which she won a best actress Oscar , Dunaway said that there have been enough failures , misfires ( most notably portraying Joan Crawford in 1981 ' s &quot; Mommie Dearest , &quot; a campy celebration of black eyebrow_pencil , shoulder_pads and coat_hangers ) and dry spells in her career to make her know the fear . &quot; That whole decade of the ' 80s , I was really out_of_sight , out of mind , &quot; mused Dunaway . &quot; I came_back ( from England ) because I think I missed my country . So I think that was a period when I thought , well , I ' m going_to have to really see what I can do with this , sort of , final chapter . &quot; It ( the role of Norma Desmond ) is kind of a natural for me , in a way . I ' m going_to play her as 50 , the age she was in the movie . I think there ' s something that Wilder was trying to say about a 50-year-old woman in Hollywood that does not apply to a 50-year-old woman in any other walk_of_life . You can be a great journalist when you ' re 50 ; you can be a senator when you are 50 . You can be almost anything , except a model or an actress . &quot; I remember when I was 18 , all I wanted was to be 25 , or 30 . And , I remember , as a New York Times article said then , that Barbara Stanwyck , for example , always seemed to be 38 . The stars weren ' t young . You didn ' t see stars that looked_like Julia Roberts . The fashion until recently was that the leading ladies were more , kind of , womanly . &quot; They used to be women , not girls . But then , by 50 , they still weren ' t working. &quot; And , Dunaway added , she connects with Norma Desmond for another reason -- she knows a Hollywood lifestyle that may never exist again . &quot; I came_in on the tail_end of the star system , I think , &quot; Dunaway said . &quot; The costumes , for example : For ' Chinatown , ' for ' Bonnie and Clyde , ' they were all handmade . . . . It was still like the old Hollywood . You don ' t get much of the old Hollywood anymore . I ' m sort of a ' bridge ' character in a funny way , you know . It ' s a whole arena that I ' m familiar with. &quot; * Since &quot; Mommie Dearest , &quot; Dunaway said , &quot; I ' ve absolutely shied_away_from doing a larger-than-life movie-star role . Because I ' d attempted it once , and . . . I think my work was good in that movie , but it didn ' t tell the story of what really happens. &quot; Music and lyrics provide Lloyd Webber ' s &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; with the subtext &quot; Mommie Dearest &quot; lacked , Dunaway said . &quot; More_than the speech . . . it does reveal the soul of the woman , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s like a close-up in the movies . In an instant , you can reveal it . People don ' t say their emotions. &quot; Dunaway said she hopes that playing Norma Desmond will , in some way , give her a chance to rethink the star syndrome of &quot; Mommie Dearest. &quot; &quot; It didn ' t work , it didn ' t come_out the way we initially hoped , but we wanted to get_at this thing that is stardom , and how insidious and powerful it is , you know , &quot; Dunaway said . &quot; Judy Garland was killed by this star system -- it was pills to keep you up , and pills to bring you back down. &quot; While she considers herself a survivor , Dunaway said she knows Hollywood ' s power all too well . &quot; You have people who perpetuate the illusion , &quot; Dunaway said . &quot; People who will be able to get a raise in salary on your next movie if they keep you feeling that you ' re the biggest star . It ' s part of the business . And it has happened to me . I ' ve had people in my life at times who ( helped me ) ostrich myself up , and I didn ' t really get_to see what was happening . But ( those people ) live_off you . &quot; You have to be strong in this business , you really have to be strong . I mean , the whole movie-making business is tough . It ' s very tough . The hours are really long , and what fracturing it does to your own reality is very tricky . I think there are some people who have it mastered , but there are tragedies . &quot; What happens is , in Norma ' s case -- and I ' m sure for me in some degree -- there was a period in my stardom . . . where you are in kind of a cocoon , away from reality . But she was told that no , she was still the greatest star . She was still the greatest star . &quot; And when you live_in an illusion , and that illusion is stripped away from you the way ( Norma ' s younger lover ) Joe Gillis does_in the final scenes , you cannot accept it . And the truth smacks up and breaks you -- and breaks you . &quot; In the end , her dream enfolded her . Just took her . It was the pain of having to face the truth. &quot; Dunaway -- whose speeding train of thought takes frequent detours , stops and occasional complete derailments -- took a contemplative pause . &quot; Maybe I will touch what I ' m trying to say here if I can just be_quiet about trying to find it , &quot; she said . &quot; This is the tragedy , I think . . . . What is the tragedy of Hollywood , of movies and of stardom ? You live_in a certain reality , and that reality is very heightened . And it ' s the best of everything . &quot; They used to bring trays of real jewelry for ( Norma ) to choose which one she wanted to wear in the scene , you know . And the garments were all hand-sewn . They were immaculately fitted . It was just like royalty , ( the stars ) were our kings and queens . She says this wonderful thing : ' We taught the world new ways to dream . To dream. ' So it ' s great . It ' s big , what they did. &quot; Dunaway is attracted to big dreams . If you ' ve never sung a note in public , what more logical next step than to audition for a starring role in an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ? &quot; You know , it ' s been a dream of mine to sing , &quot; Dunaway said . &quot; I ' m from the South ( born in Bascom , Fla. , she has lived throughout the South ) ; I used to sing country_and_western whenever I could . And with my first husband , ( former J . Geils Band singer ) Peter Wolf , we used to sing a lot . But I never studied it seriously . I never had a reason . This gave me a very important reason. &quot; When she first became interested in the role ( she says her decision to approach the &quot; Sunset &quot; people was concurrent with them approaching her ) , she was invited in to sing . &quot; They said : ' Just come_in , and let ' s see if you can carry a tune ; we ' ll get you a great coach. ' And I said , no , let me work a little bit on my own first . I worked for only two or three weeks . Every day . Long hours . And then I auditioned for ( musical supervisor ) David Caddick . And then we spoke , and , because I had no real training , he said , ' I don ' t know if ( pursuing this role ) is what you want. ' &quot; It was what she wanted . So Caddick suggested that Dunaway work with Corff , the voice coach who trained Close_in the beginning . Dunaway worked with him &quot; for four weeks straight , between two and nine hours a day , every day. &quot; Then she auditioned for Caddick again . &quot; The second time I auditioned , he kind of sat_back and said , ' Well , that ' s quite a difference ! ' &quot; And then came &quot; the most terrifying thing I ' ve ever done &quot; -- an audition for Lloyd Webber . Afterward , he called Dunaway personally to tell her she had the part . &quot; It ' s a technique . It ' s still a very new discipline for me , but you know , you can learn to sing , &quot; she said . &quot; And then I guess how good you get depends_on a lot of things . But it seems like I can carry a tune , and I know notes . I can hit a note when I hear it . So my ear seems to be good. &quot; With stage microphones , Dunaway said , &quot; you don ' t have to have a big voice . . . but you have to be able to sustain notes , and you have to be able to hit big notes and hold them . ( LuPone ) , for example , has a very big voice . . . . I ' m not so immodest as_to believe I can ever sing along those lines . But I intend to keep trying , and to see what I am capable of. &quot; * Upon being cast as Norma Desmond , Close , in her mid-40s , admitted she had some fears about playing an older character , and one so_much defined by age . For Dunaway , the concern about finding herself identified with this role might be a little different . She has been strongly identified with tough , cold movie roles such_as Bonnie Parker , &quot; Network ' s &quot; ratings-crazed TV executive Diana Christensen and frosty Joan Crawford ; psychotic screen queen Norma Desmond also fits neatly into that weird mold . Moreover , Desmond is the quintessential &quot; difficult &quot; actor -- and Dunaway , rightly or wrongly , has developed her own reputation as the movie_star from hell . Dunaway has no problem acknowledging that she ' s 53 . She baldly admits such career mistakes as &quot; Mommie Dearest. &quot; She has relished unsympathetic and unattractive roles , jumped with ego-less ease from movie stardom to TV sitcoms . She ' s maintained that kind of experimentation , leading her to include a &quot; Columbo &quot; movie with Peter Falk among her credits . And , of course , there ' s the Lloyd Webber audition . She speaks with cheerful resignation about her failed TV series last fall , &quot; It Had to Be You. &quot; The CBS show cast Dunaway as a successful book publisher who falls_for a widowed carpenter ( Robert Urich ) with three kids . It lasted four episodes . &quot; I really wanted to try comedy . And I still do , and I still will , &quot; Dunaway said . &quot; I think that kind of comedy doesn ' t seem to be right for me . It ' s like snapshots . It ' s jokes . I think the comedians do_best in it . You cannot work the way I normally work -- I mean , how detailed I get , and how intensive the research is . &quot; I think everyone who tried it did the best they could do . It really wasn ' t meant to be . I don ' t think it ' s anyone ' s fault -- not the writers , not me , not Urich . In retrospect it just wasn ' t the right place for me . All of them were great , but you just can ' t get your hands around it . I felt_like water was just going_through my fingers. &quot; Yet , despite steely nerve , as far as career choices are concerned let an interviewer suggest that Dunaway has a press reputation for being &quot; difficult &quot; and she dissolves into a panic almost like Norma Desmond does when she loses Joe Gillis . One might think by now that Dunaway would have become hardened to celebrity journalism . Not so . Raise the issue of her well-known reputation to Dunaway and she , quite simply , shatters . She is shaken . She is angry . She is upset enough to threaten to end an interview . &quot; If that ' s what you want to talk_about , I would like to leave , &quot; she said . &quot; Now -- I would like to say what I want to say in this article. &quot; She leaves abruptly for a_few minutes to pull herself together . She returns , however , and gamely continues . And while she remains evasive about her reputed bad-girl behavior in Hollywood , she hints that a failure to click with director Roman Polanski on the set of &quot; Chinatown &quot; just may have set the tone for a reputation that lingers two decades later . &quot; The need to build you up is equaled only by the need to bring you down . . . . You can ' t have all good experiences in life , and you ' re not gonna come_off great sometimes , &quot; she said . &quot; And there would be exaggerations , and sometimes there will be exaggerations and everything else is false , &quot; she continued slowly . &quot; There will be a kernel of truth , and everything else has been embroidered over it . &quot; I mean , it was just an unfortunate connection between me and Roman . He is a great filmmaker . I think he respects me as well . I just think we met at a time in our lives when neither one of us could kind of give , and say : ' Hey , wait a minute , let me step back. ' Which is what I do now , all_the time. &quot; Those who have worked with Dunaway recently are not sure from whence her dragon lady reputation springs . Jeremy Leven , writer-director of the upcoming film &quot; Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold , &quot; called Dunaway &quot; charming and gracious and a real doll. &quot; While one individual associated with her failed sitcom noted cryptically that &quot; there are two Fayes , &quot; Terry Corigliano , director of CBS ' media relations , said that Dunaway had personally called the network and asked to meet with the marketing and publicity staff who would be handling her show -- turning_down their invitation to a frilly lunch at Maple Drive to hunker_down over a sandwich in a CBS conference_room . &quot; She asked us questions , and really wanted to learn about TV , &quot; Corigliano said . &quot; I don ' t think we ' ve ever had a star do that before . By the time she was ready to start promoting that show , Faye Dunaway knew what she was supposed to know. &quot; When the freshly divorced Dunaway returned to the United States from England , her first film role was with Mickey Rourke as two down-and-out alcoholics in Barbet Schroeder ' s 1987 film &quot; Barfly. &quot; Rourke -- whose reputation for temperament possibly outshines Dunaway ' s -- offered an unsolicited advance review of &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; when Dunaway replaces Close : &quot; It ' ll be a much better show. &quot; &quot; Before Faye and I got_together , I heard horror stories about her , and I ' m sure she heard the same thing about me , &quot; Rourke said . &quot; But everything I heard about her was not true -- and , I guess , vice versa . I can honestly say I don ' t think I have worked with anybody who is as professional as she was . I appreciated it more because I am usually talked_about as being difficult , in the same way. &quot; Rourke also applauded Dunaway for daring to be ugly in &quot; Barfly. &quot; &quot; This wasn ' t this leading lady type ; she had to play a character who didn ' t have very much makeup on , one who wasn ' t really glamorous . She was secure about that ; it was sort of a bold chance she took . &quot; She is , like , one of the last true movie_stars . Faye Dunaway has been a movie_star since ' Bonnie and Clyde. ' . . . She ' s a big screen actress , and she always will be. &quot; Joan Tewkesbury , who did a rewrite for Dunaway on the 1978 film &quot; Eyes of Laura Mars &quot; and directed &quot; Cold Sassy Tree , &quot; said that &quot; both as a director and as a writer , you are thrilled to have someone who will go_to the mat for a shared vision . Her work was fine -- there were no problems once the rules of the game were laid_out , that you have a very short shooting schedule for TV . &quot; What people call difficult -- the same thing happens with Streisand -- any of the women who come_through the difficulties of this business , and God knows they have had to endure all kinds of experiences , have very rigorous criteria of who they are , and how they are going_to do_it . And they have done_it for some of the best people in the business. &quot; As for that unpleasant Polanski period , Tewkesbury said , rather cryptically , &quot; That was a very difficult time in her life . People are allowed to go_through their passages ; God knows , everybody has them . These women are called_upon to be incredibly strong , and sometimes you just can ' t do_it that day , or that month or that week . &quot; Actors have a great regard for Faye ; they understand the struggle , and the baggage that comes_with being a celebrity. &quot; Was Dunaway , then , a terror in the early days of her career who somehow mellowed out during the ' 80s ? &quot; Network &quot; director Sidney Lumet said that , circa 1976 , Dunaway was &quot; a joy to work with . She ' s a completely creative actor ; she is brave , she is fearless , she is true_to the character . She doesn ' t worry about whether it ' s sympathetic or not sympathetic . &quot; I heard she was difficult before we started , and she just wasn ' t . It just never happened . I ' m not hiding anything from you . I do know that , in some instances , when these kinds of reputations develop , it ' s because the actor is working with people who don ' t know as much about their work as the actor does . that ' s the one thing that the actor needs. &quot; Added Lumet : &quot; I think , generally , that people are always surprised that such an incredible beauty has that much talent . Usually there is that kind of condescending thing , especially for actresses -- assuming , looking_at a beautiful woman , that she can ' t have any brains . And there she is . She ' s beautiful , and she can act. &quot; Even though Dunaway will never quite come right out and say she was ever . . . difficult , she will guardedly acknowledge that perfectionism can sometimes be misinterpreted -- and that , over the years , she has come_to more easily accept human flaws . &quot; I ' m in the business of trying to achieve something wonderful , and so you use all_of your wit and courage and mind and try to make_it special , &quot; she said . &quot; I mean , that ' s what art is -- that ' s what people come_to movies or the theater for , to see something special . &quot; They say that you only grow through trial_and_error . And I believe that . You only grow by doing something wrong . So , anyway , I feel that I am at a place where I ' m the best I ' ve ever been , hopefully , for my mind , my emotions and the way I live my life . &quot; I know that what I wanted at this moment in my life was some material that I really cared about . . . something I could sink my teeth into and I could really be happy about . And it ' s very hard work . But I really got more_than I asked_for because I also have to sing . So I just wanted a great big old challenge. &quot; And , Dunaway added , &quot; You can ' t fake it to an audience . They have very good truth barometers . They don ' t have an ax to grind , and they ' re ready to like you -- as opposed to sometimes in our ( Hollywood ) world where there are middlemen who say , ' Well , if I ' m nice to her , and tell her she ' s wonderful , I ' ll get the job on her next movie ' or something . &quot; It ' s a nice connection . And it ' s an honest one. &quot; *</TEXT>
