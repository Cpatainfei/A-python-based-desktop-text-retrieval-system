   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY ; TAKING THE HIGH ROAD ; WHY HELICOPTERS ARE GIVING POLICE DEPARTMENTS A LIFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Each pilot of a police helicopter has a favorite tale . For Investigator Bob Mulhall , Pasadena ' s chief pilot , it ' s the time he caught two car thieves and recovered the stolen car without even trying . One night , he said , he was simply sweeping his spotlight along the ground as he flew patrol when two guys slammed_on the brakes and jumped_out of their car . &quot; For bad_guys , that light is like a death ray -- they have to get_out of it , &quot; said Mulhall . &quot; They always think Big Brother is up there watching them. &quot; Pasadena police pilot George Ramos ' favorite chuckle involves the guy who was about to vault a fence to elude his pursuers . Suddenly , the suspect heard a voice in the sky from a seemingly omniscient presence . &quot; Are you sure you want to jump that fence ? &quot; Ramos ' voice boomed through the chopper ' s speaker_system . &quot; There ' s a big dog waiting for you over there. &quot; Rapid response_times and the advantage of having an all-seeing eye to back_up ground officers are two of the reasons more and more San Gabriel Valley police_departments are following the example of larger cities and swapping beat cops for beating rotorblades . One-fifth of the departments in the area have helicopter programs in place , and several other departments are taking_a_look at adding choppers . Pasadena and Pomona police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , which patrols several valley cities , have been flying helicopter patrols for over 25 years . El Monte started its own helicopter program in September 1993 and Baldwin Park started a part-time helicopter program last week . &quot; I don ' t know how a police_department can get_by today without a helicopter , &quot; said Lt . Terry Blumenthal , who heads_up the Pasadena police helicopter program . A major consideration fueling such programs is manpower : statistics from the state_Attorney General ' s office reveal that the San Gabriel Valley is technically under-policed . The area ' s 19 police_departments average 1.3 officers per 1 # 000 residents ; the national average is 2.2. More departments are finding that helicopters enable their finite police_force to keep_up with a load of calls that sometimes seems as if it ' s approaching the infinite . Blumenthal points_out that his team of a half-dozen officers , three pilots and three observers assisted on 1 # 000 arrests in 1993 and handled about 10 # 000 calls . Considering the entire 222-officer department made 10 # 201 arrests in 1993 , his six officers were involved in one-tenth of all_the collars made last year . &quot; Helicopters so reduce response_times . . . . You can catch people you never would ' ve caught , &quot; Blumenthal said . &quot; Our worst response_time is 58 seconds , and when you consider cars take about six minutes to get_to crimes even on priority one calls , that ' s a big difference. &quot; One recent night , the infrared screen flickered in the fishbowl cockpit of the two-seat Pasadena police helicopter as the rotors beat the air and sped it to a crime scene at more_than 100 m.p.h. The infrared system turns the world into a black-and-white negative of real_life , with hot images showing_up bright white and darkened city streets flowing across the screen an inky black , their borders defined only by the heat from the streetlights . A man who had been spotted brandishing a handgun in a Pasadena neighborhood and officers responding to the call showed_up on the screen like tiny characters in a real-life video_game , the police the ghosts relentlessly chasing the Pac-Man of the fleeing suspect through the maze of the streets . &quot; The more afraid you are or the more you run , the hotter you are and the better you show_up , &quot; Mulhall said . The helicopter crew spotted the man crouching in the bushes by the side of a home -- the heat sensors are advanced enough that footprints show_up in grass on cool nights -- and even picked_out the dark shape of the man ' s steel handgun , which stood_out against the warmer background of the living grass . Via radio , the pilot led officers directly to the surprised gunman , who figured he was safe as long as he stayed quiet under the cover of the bushes . &quot; We found this guy within one minute , &quot; added Mulhall , noting that with no red_lights or traffic to contend with in the sky , the helicopter responded within 30 seconds of the call . Departments also find the helicopters useful in the search for ways to keep police use of force to a minimum . Pinning_down a suspect in a spotlight and waiting for help to arrive is being seen as a preferable alternative to pinning_down a suspect with a physical takedown , said Bryan Vila , an assistant_professor in the criminology department at the University of California at Irvine . &quot; If it ' s nighttime and you ' re chasing some person in the dark through back alleys , you have no way of knowing if it ' s some scared teenager or some three- or four-time heavy loser who ' s been pumping iron in prison and is heavily armed , &quot; said Vila , who served with the sheriff ' s department for nine years before going_back to school for his doctorate . &quot; But if you have the helicopter , they can tell you , ' He ' s huddled behind some bushes , you ' re almost on top of him. ' It ' s a much safer situation for you and for the suspect . The more control police have , the more they ' re able to attenuate their use of force. &quot; Pasadena owns five helicopters , one Bell Jet Ranger 206IIIB and four turbocharged Enstrom F28Fs , which fly about 10 hours a day , Mulhall said . Though police_departments maintain that the high visibility of the choppers is a major key to developing the mentality among crooks that the long arm of the law can reach them anywhere , officers still field occasional calls from residents complaining about the aircraft buzzing like giant mechanical gnats above their houses all night . &quot; We try to address any kind of inquiry immediately , &quot; said Lt . Tom Oldfield as he sat in front of the phones at Pasadena police ' s Benedict Heliport . &quot; We check with the guys flying and we ' ll tell ( the callers ) , ' We ' re checking out a liquor_store that ' s been robbed. ' That usually suffices , most people will say , ' Oh , thanks , we were just wondering. ' &quot; Many residents of northwest Pasadena , an area well-trafficked by the helicopters , regard the hovering choppers as a necessary evil . &quot; I would rather hear them circling overhead than hear shooting in my neighborhood and have them not be there , &quot; said Alma Nelson , a community service representative who works the phones at the Jackie Robinson Community_Center and lives nearby . Nelson added she does not hear any serious complaints from neighborhood residents about the aircraft . Complaints are the last thing on the minds of area shopkeepers . &quot; I can only give those guys praises and pluses on my behalf , &quot; said Walter Butler , 53 , the owner of Walt Butler Sports Shoes on North Lake Avenue . &quot; It ' s the one service I feel is totally worth paying for. &quot; Pomona and El Monte report similar situations . &quot; We understand that some people have complained about the helicopter , &quot; said training Sgt . Mark Sullivan , who heads_up the El Monte program . &quot; But we ' ve also gotten petitions with 20 signatures of people in support of the helicopter . And at 2 a.m. , when you see a prowler , it ' s nice within 30 seconds to have a 15-million candlepower light circling your house. &quot; Pilots admit that the hardest part of patrolling from the air is knowing where you are , and occasionally choppers drop low to read freeway signs or look_for landmarks . Most government-owned structures and automobiles , including low-income housing projects and city buses , are topped with numbers who help the crews find their way around . But most of the time , the pilots memorize landmarks and count streets . Ramos , 37 , worked as a patrol cop for eight years before becoming a helicopter trainee . After passing a_battery of tests , he worked as an observer for about three years before being trained as a pilot . While no pilots have ever been killed flying for Pasadena , he is one of the few who has been injured while on_duty , shot during the riots that followed the not_guilty verdicts in the first Rodney G . King beating trial in 1992 . &quot; A fragment of a 9mm bullet came_up through the canopy and ricocheted and hit me under the chin , &quot; he said . &quot; Felt like someone had hit me in the jaw as hard as they could. &quot; He landed the helicopter safely and his wound turned_out to be minor , he said . Crashes are rare among helicopters , as the aircraft can pivot their rotors to let air_pressure keep them spinning even if their engines cut_out . &quot; I had an electrical failure back in the summer of 1988 , &quot; Mulhall recalled . &quot; My engine cut_out and had to I put it down in the middle of the Fuddrucker ' s parking_lot over by Michillinda ( Avenue ) . . . We put_up some tape around it , and everybody just thought the police helicopter was_on display. &quot; Cost is the major stumbling_block for operating a helicopter program . Pasadena ' s program cost $ 1.45 million , though Blumenthal noted that about $ 362 # 000 went_to actual helicopter-related costs , with the rest going towards salaries for the pilots , observers and ground_crews . Pomona ' s program used to boast three helicopters , but budget problems in the mid-1980s forced the city to ground two of the aircraft , said Sgt . Ken Gillespie , the officer in_charge of the air support program . The Pomona budget is about a third of Pasadena ' s -- $ 465 # 000 -- but the department ' s Enstrom 280FX still assisted on 300 arrests in 1993 , and flies about five hours a day , five days a week , he said . Baldwin Park and El Monte have been able to keep their helicopter costs lower -- around $ 78 # 000 per year -- by renting low-cost aircraft for a set number of hours each month , about 10 hours per week . Baldwin Park Police_Chief Carmine Lanza said money from the department ' s asset forfeiture fund and funds from public safety Proposition 172 is financing his city ' s helicopter program for the first year of operation . El Monte , whose program has been operating since September 1993 on a 10-hour per week basis , went the same route , paying_for all costs through its seized assets . Costs are cut further because the Robinson R-22 , the helicopter used by both El Monte and Baldwin Park , is a low-maintenance , two-person aircraft that costs about $ 115 per hour to fly , compared with about $ 450 per hour for a larger chopper . Lanza hopes to interest other departments in sharing the price of the air support . &quot; We ' re planning on approaching chiefs in other areas to try and put a regional shared-cost program together , &quot; he said . Departments in Alhambra , Covina and Monterey Park have expressed interest , but most are waiting to see how El Monte and Baldwin Park fare before actually committing any financial resources . &quot; We think it ' s a great idea , a great program , but what holds us back is the money , &quot; said Covina police_Chief John Lentz , whose city is still wrestling with a potential $ 1 million deficit Though U.S. Helicopters , a firm based in Long_Beach , is just squeaking out a profit on the aircraft rentals now , director of operations Bob Muse hopes he will land more contracts with more departments as they see what the helicopters can do . &quot; I started_out with this idea about three years ago , &quot; said Muse , who also is the primary pilot of the El Monte police chopper . &quot; We approached all_the agencies in the San Gabriel Valley ... and before , we couldn ' t get anyone to listen , &quot; he said . &quot; But once we got El Monte , ( the departments ) are actually calling me now. &quot;</TEXT>
