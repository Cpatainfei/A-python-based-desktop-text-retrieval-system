   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; ' SPACE SHUTTLE ' FAILS TO SOAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Discovery Channel ' s &quot; The Space Shuttle &quot; is a rather unfocused , often lethargic and sometimes downright boring effort -- much like its subject . In this respect , it is perhaps the perfect documentary of the nation ' s current manned space_program . This meandering , two-hour look_at NASA ' s &quot; cost-ineffective white_elephant , &quot; as Carl Sagan describes it , moves at times as slowly as the giant &quot; crawler &quot; that carries the shuttle at 1 m.p.h. to its launch_pad . The viewer is subjected_to the banal reflections of an endless stream of talking heads -- technicians , administrators and astronauts themselves . While it is clear that these are extremely dedicated , hard-working people , NASA personnel have never been known for their charisma . Producer Tim Cowling and director-writer Scott Hicks would have been wiser_to tell the shuttle ' s story through the eyes of two or three of the more colorful participants -- perhaps following astronaut Story Musgrave , &quot; flow director &quot; Tip Talone and a soldier in the army of technicians from preparation through touchdown of a single shuttle flight . Spaceflight intrinsically is an exciting , imagination-provoking subject and , despite its overall vanilla flavor , &quot; The Space Shuttle &quot; does have its moments : some spectacular , but far too infrequent , footage of the dicey repair of the Hubble Space Telescope and other missions ; Talone ' s poignant commentary as he wanders through the eerie remnants of the Apollo moon-shot program , which are &quot; just lying_in the sand . . . like bones in a graveyard &quot; at the Kennedy Space Center ; Musgrave ' s matter-of-fact admission that &quot; I ' m scared to death of launches &quot; ; the revelation that the astronauts wear diapers for takeoff ; and a technician ' s tearful recollections of the program ' s only fatal flight , the Challenger . Even just a short clip inserted from the Apollo days of the 1960s reminds the viewer of how uninspiring the manned space_program has become in the last_quarter century . The documentary could have used this theme of decline from the &quot; right stuff &quot; days to sharpen its production and give it some perspective . * &quot; The Space Shuttle &quot; airs Sunday at 9 p.m. and midnight on cable ' s Discovery Channel .
