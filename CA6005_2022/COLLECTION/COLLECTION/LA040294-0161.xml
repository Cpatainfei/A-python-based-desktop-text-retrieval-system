   <HEADLINE> U.S. RELEASES NEW PAPERS ON KENNEDY ASSASSINATION ; RECORDS : DOCUMENTS AT NATIONAL ARCHIVES OFFER INTERESTING GLIMPSES OF OSWALD , FBI . INFORMATION DOESN ' T CHALLENGE LONE-GUNMAN CONCLUSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s too soon to say for_sure , but conspiracy fatigue may be setting_in . The National Archives prepared_for Friday ' s release of a raft of new government documents relating to the assassination of President John F . Kennedy by assembling enough research guides and security officers to handle a full-scale rush on the stacks . But as the day wore_on , the archivists often outnumbered the reporters and researchers who turned_up to sift through the records . Awaiting them were 80 cardboard boxes of declassified FBI records on Lee Harvey Oswald , along with four boxes of desk diaries and telephone records from Robert F . Kennedy ' s tenure as attorney_general and five boxes of records from the mid-1970s Senate Select Committee that studied the intelligence community and its possible links to President Kennedy ' s assassination . Researchers won ' t assimilate all_the material for months or years , if ever . National Archives officials who have paged through the documents say there is no stunning new fact that challenges the conclusion that Oswald , acting alone , shot the President on Nov . 22 , 1963 . * Of course , there also appears to be nothing in the papers to dissuade those who believe Oswald had help , or was the tool of Cubans , the CIA , the Mafia , or some combination of the three . But the ocean of memos , documents and Teletypes offer tantalizing glimpses of the personality and behavior of Oswald , the FBI at_work , the concerns of top government officials in the days after the assassination , and the endless collection of loose_ends that have entangled conspiracy theorists ever since . Two memos , for instance , underscore the speed with which the FBI and the Justice_Department appeared to have concluded that Oswald acted alone . Only one day after the assassination , then-FBI Director J . Edgar Hoover , in his first memo on the case to President Lyndon B . Johnson , appears to have foreclosed the possibility that others assisted Oswald . In the five-page memo summarizing Oswald ' s background and the evidence against him , Hoover uses only singular -- never plural -- terms to describe the &quot; assailant &quot; and &quot; the person responsible_for this assassination. &quot; * On Nov . 25 , 1963 , the day after Oswald was killed , Deputy Atty . Gen . Nicholas Katzenbach wrote Bill Moyers , then a top aide to Johnson , urging that the FBI make public &quot; a complete and thorough report &quot; on Oswald as soon as possible to discourage the emergence of conspiracy theories . &quot; The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin ; that he did not have confederates who are still at_large ; and that the evidence was such_that he would have been convicted at trial , &quot; Katzenbach wrote . He added : &quot; Speculation about Oswald ' s motivation ought to be cut_off , and we should have some basis for rebutting thought that this was a Communist conspiracy or ( as the Iron_Curtain press is saying ) a right-wing conspiracy to blame it on the Communists. &quot; In fact , in December , 1963 , the FBI turned_over to the Justice_Department a report , which was leaked to the press , that concluded Oswald acted alone . But , as the documents released Friday illustrate , conspiracy theories about the murder proliferated anyway . In one instance , FBI_agents days after the murder responded to a memo sent to the bureau by a United States Information Agency official who attempted to implicate China . The agents assigned to review the submitted evidence concluded that the &quot; document contains nothing but speculation . . . . It appears he was interested in getting his theory down on paper as quickly as possible and was attempting to attract some attention to himself. &quot; More serious questions were raised by Petr . S . Derjabin , described in a Nov . 26 , 1963 , memo as &quot; an admitted former Soviet intelligence officer. &quot; Derjabin told the FBI he &quot; does not believe the Soviet government had any knowledge of Oswald ' s plans to assassinate President Kennedy ; however he does believe that Oswald and his wife had some connection with the Russian intelligence service. &quot; Derjabin , the report continued , &quot; feels that Oswald ' s departure from the Soviet_Union was planned by the intelligence service. &quot; Even members of the Communist_Party of the United States had their own theories . According to an unnamed FBI informant , top party officials , at a meeting days after the assassination , indicated that they believed &quot; someone else did the shooting but all_the evidence was stacked against Oswald to point to him as the guilty person. &quot; The portrait of Oswald that emerges from the papers is at once desolate and poignant . One of the most compelling documents is a psychiatric report ordered on Oswald by a New York City family court judge in 1953 after Oswald was brought_in for excessive truancy . The psychiatrist describes Oswald , then 13 , as &quot; seriously detached , withdrawn . . . laconic and taciturn. &quot; The report continues : &quot; There is a rather pleasant , appealing quality about ( this ) emotionally starved , affectionless youngster . Grows as one speaks_to him , and it seems fairly clear that he detached himself from the world around him because no ( one ) in it ever met any of his needs and love. &quot; * But , the psychiatrist added , Oswald &quot; acknowledged fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting or killing people but refused to talk_about the dreams , other_than to admit that they sometimes contained violence. &quot; Another memo suggests that Oswald had changed little along the tangled course that led him to the assassination in Dallas . A few days after the murder , a woman who described herself as a childhood acquaintance of Oswald recounted to the FBI a conversation she had with him and his Russian wife , Marina , in New Orleans in July , 1963 . The woman asked Oswald ' s wife how she liked the United States . &quot; Me like America , &quot; Marina Oswald responded , according to the memo . &quot; Lee no like Russia . Lee no like America . Lee like moon. &quot;</TEXT>
