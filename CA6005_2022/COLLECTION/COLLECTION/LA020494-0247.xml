   <HEADLINE> HUGE , ANCIENT PORT CITY UNCOVERED IN MEXICO ; ARCHEOLOGY : DATING FROM THE DECLINE OF THE ROMAN_EMPIRE , IT FLOURISHED FOR 500 YEARS ON VERACRUZ STATE ' S COAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The remains of a huge , ancient port city believed to have flourished for 500 years during the decline of the Roman_Empire have been discovered on Mexico ' s Gulf Coast , the National Geographic Society announced Thursday . With more_than 150 earthen pyramids and other buildings , the biggest 100 feet high , the port seems to have been North_America ' s largest coastal city 1 # 500 years ago . The site , in the state of Veracruz , has been named El Pital for a nearby town . Although digging has not begun at the site , an examination of the surface has already yielded artifacts and information that establish the city ' s importance as a multiethnic political , commercial and agricultural center from AD 100 to 600 . El Pital could provide important clues to gaps in ancient Mexican history in areas bordering the seats of the Mayan and Aztec empires , said American archeologist S . Jeffrey K . Wilkerson of the Institute for Cultural Ecology of the Tropics in Tampa , Fla . He is directing the exploration , which is partly funded by National Geographic . El Pital residents probably traded with their contemporaries at Teotihuacan , site of the famous pyramids north of the capital that were built by a civilization that predated the Aztecs . The city is likely to have been an early rival of El Tajin , a later city 40 miles away that until now was the biggest archeological site in northern Veracruz . El Pital appears to have been larger than El Tajin , controlling an area that included more_than 40 square_miles of suburbs and farmland and probably influencing an area several times that large . The discovery could also have significant ecological implications because the ancient civilization seems to have supported more_than 20 # 000 people -- similar to the population of the area today -- using farming techniques less harmful to the environment than the intensive chemical agriculture now practiced there . &quot; The ( population ) density we ' re seeing far exceeds anything that preceded it in this area and even those that follow until the end of the 20th Century , &quot; Wilkerson said . &quot; Something special was going_on technologically that allowed that to happen and that has not occurred in the intervening 1 # 500 years. &quot; The fields around El Pital were made highly productive by some of the largest earth-moving projects of their time . Canals were dug to drain wetlands or to channel fresh_water into rich estuaries that brackish water would otherwise have left infertile . Residents also appear to have constructed an artificial island to guard the two slow-moving rivers that provided access to their city from the Gulf_of_Mexico . One of those rivers is the Nautla , Mexico ' s 26th-largest river , notable because it floods every year , like the ancient Nile , leaving farmers a layer of rich silt . The city ' s demise may have been connected to a megacycle of El Nino , a climatic phenomenon that resulted in six months a year of the cold , windy rains known as nortes , Wilkerson theorized . Some cocoa farmers still lived_in the region at the time of the Spanish conquest , but disease had mainly wiped them out by the end of the 16th Century . The jungle reclaimed the area until plantation_owners cleared it again in the 1930s and 1940s . Today ' s farmers rely_on chemicals to fertilize plantations in what is now one of Mexico ' s most important banana and citrus regions . Those chemicals have stained ancient ceramic fragments -- whose varied patterns led scientists to believe that the area was multiethnic -- and even obsidian , an extremely dense volcanic material seldom penetrated , Wilkerson said . Besides everyday ceramics , archeologists have found a mask that resembles the image of the ancient rain god Tlaloc and a four-inch clay head believed to depict a sacrificed ballgame player . Residents of El Pital seem to have been major fans of ballgames : Eight courts have already been identified in the area . &quot; This is an extensive site with huge monuments for that period , &quot; said Enrique Nalda , technical secretary of Mexico ' s National Institute of Archeology and History , which granted Wilkerson a permit to explore the El Pital area . Ironically , Wilkerson discovered El Pital because the institute nearly two years ago refused to allow him to continue working in an area farther upriver , where he has carried_out investigations over the last three decades .</TEXT>
