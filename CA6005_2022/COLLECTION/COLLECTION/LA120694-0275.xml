   <HEADLINE> ALREADY A REPUBLICAN OUTCAST , HORCHER MAKES BREAK OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Slamming his hand on his desk and shouting , &quot; Brown ! , &quot; Republican Assemblyman Paul Horcher on Monday emphatically defected from his party by casting his vote for Assembly Speaker for Democrat Willie Brown . The maverick lawmaker declared that he was becoming the Assembly ' s only independent . Horcher ' s dramatic action triggered a 40-40 stalemate in California ' s lower legislative house and once again propelled the trial_lawyer from Diamond Bar into the spotlight . &quot; As an independent , I will be free_of political_party bosses and better able to fight for my constituents , &quot; Horcher , 43 , declared in a prepared statement . He said he had paid his dues , noting his support for Gov . Pete Wilson ' s state budgets when many of his GOP colleagues abandoned the Republican governor . In 1991 , Horcher cast the 54th and deciding vote for the budget . But in the wake of that vote , Brown took good care of Horcher , naming him vice_chairman of a key budget committee over objections by Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte . With the position , Horcher received additional staff . As a consequence , Horcher , who criticized the rightward tilt among Assembly Republicans , turned_into something of an outcast within his own caucus . He was criticized for favoring abortion rights and for aligning himself with the traditionally Democratic California Trial_Lawyers Assn . The antipathy was heightened last year during an unsuccessful effort at the state Republican_Party convention to censure Horcher for accepting his Ways and Means Committee position . But the contempt for Horcher never broke_into the open , as it did Monday when Republican Trice Harvey of Bakersfield in a floor speech called Horcher a &quot; political whore. &quot; Horcher said Assembly sergeants at arms escorted him off the floor at day ' s end because of anonymous death threats received in his Capitol office . A native of Texas , Horcher earned a bachelor ' s degree in political_science from Cal Poly Pomona and graduated from La Verne University College of Law before passing the State Bar in 1978 . He and his wife , Van Le , a refugee from Vietnam , have two daughters . He was first elected to the Assembly in 1990 . Considered a proud and independent lawmaker by his colleagues , Horcher has been_on the political hot_seat ever since the Nov . 8 election made_it clear that Republicans would have a razor-thin majority in the Assembly . Initially , Horcher said he might run_for Speaker and rally moderates . But no such move was attempted Monday . Instead , Horcher , cast his lot with the controversial Brown and , according to Republicans , immediately became a possible recall target .</TEXT>
