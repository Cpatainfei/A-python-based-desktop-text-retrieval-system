   <HEADLINE> TAKING HIGH ROADS AND LOW ROADS THROUGH IRELAND ; IN CONNEMARA , NESTLED IN A REMOTE COTTAGE IN A GAELIC-SPEAKING POCKET OF IRELAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was early morning . Cool and damp . I was fanning a turf fire in a fireplace that had been kitchen_stove and central_heating before the_Irish cottage , where my wife , our twin teen-age daughters and I were staying , had been modernized . Suddenly there came a heavy knocking_on the sturdy wooden front_door . Glancing out the window I saw an elderly man who I supposed to be a motorist in_trouble and seeking a telephone in this barren region , where the next phone may be 10 miles away . Edging through a closet-sized foyer bulging with coats and dirty Wellingtons , I pulled the door open . &quot; Can I help you ? &quot; I asked . &quot; Sure , and I should be helping you , &quot; the man said , smiling and walking past me directly to the fireplace . &quot; You ' ve got_it burnin ' ! &quot; he exclaimed . &quot; Howd ' ye know about turf fires ? &quot; &quot; Well , uh , I have built a_few fires , &quot; I explained apologetically . We had arrived the night before and that was my first meeting with Tom , a man with eyes as blue as the_Irish sky and a face as craggy as the rocky shore of the small inlet off Bertraghboy Bay , a_few yards behind our isolated cottage . The farmer and his wife lived a half_mile down the road . They had a long-standing arrangement with my wife ' s family in Dublin , who owned the charming cottage we were staying in , to keep_an_eye_on it when it was unoccupied . On the rare occasions when he saw an unfamiliar car_parked on the narrow road ' s grassy shoulder , generously dotted with splatters of manure from free-roaming cows , he would walk over and show the temporary occupants how to build a fire with turf , somewhat comparable_to very soft_coal . A few minutes later his wife , as bright and friendly as your favorite aunt , delighted all_of us when she arrived carrying a loaf of homemade bread baked on a fireplace hearth and faintly redolent_of turf smoke , carefully wrapped in her worn , blue apron . She said she had baked it &quot; this vera mornin ' . And ' tis for yer breakfast. &quot; Their warmth is a universal trait of the people who live_in a lonely and hauntingly beautiful corner of all Ireland , the western coastal region of Connemara whose epicenter is Glinsk . It is a stark and unyielding land . The thin soil has always given grudgingly of its fruits , and fishermen long battled the sea in fragile , oar-driven boats known as currachs . Separated from the rest of Ireland by vast bogs , bleak terrain and barren , precipitous quartzite mountains , it is a sparsely settled area , which the 20th Century is only beginning to invade , and the customs of the past are still much alive . This is the heart of Gaelic-speaking Ireland . Though the people are fluent in English , the ancient tongue -- referred to locally as Irish -- is their language of street , pub and classroom . Place_names usually are written both in English and Gaelic , and sometimes only Gaelic . Ancient pride , you know . To me , a powerful lure of this barren and remote countryside , where we have traveled on several occasions and most recently visited last December , is that it is off the tourist paths -- a wondrous place for those who seek the road less traveled , but not for those who enjoy bright lights , theater , elegant shopping and an active night life . You won ' t hear Mozart at a live concert , but your toes will tap merrily as you sit in smoke-filled pubs listening to the beat of traditional Irish music by local musicians . It is a taste of real country Irish life . Connemara has traditionally been a sparsely settled land . Because of its isolation , it historically resisted a close alliance with the rest of Ireland . The locals waved to Columbus when his flotilla stopped in Galway Bay on its way to the New World . In the mid-1800s , more_than half the population left , most coming_to America because of the potato famine . In the late 1800s , Clifden -- today one of Connemara ' s main tourist centers -- became the unofficial capital of the region and a popular vacation location for British hunters and fishermen . Motorists have no trouble finding Glinsk , sometimes spelled Glynsk or Glinsce , on road maps of Connemara , 176 miles almost due_west of Dublin . But they may never know they ' ve found it while driving along a narrow and lonely coastal stretch of Route L102 . Glinsk consists_of only three or four widely scattered cottages and the gleaming white Glynsk House , a modest hotel atop a small hill in the middle of nowhere , between bog and ocean , with sweeping views of the striking landscape . The hotel has a dozen charming rooms , a bar popular as a local gathering place and a turf fire always flickering cozily in the lobby . Some eight empty miles south is the village of Carna . As Connemara is a center of one of Ireland ' s Gaelic-speaking pockets , this tiny community is the very soul of those who cling_to the ancient tongue . Between Glinsk and Carna are more of the endless flat peat_bogs pushing_up against the mountains . On our first drive to Carna we stopped to watch a_couple_of farmers cutting and piling heavy black peat into long rows to let it dry before it is compressed into shiny , black brick-size blocks of turf , a task they have performed for generations . The girls were delighted when they waved and the farmers , leaning_on their shovels , waved back , beckoning them to come_over for a visit . Occasionally one drives past a cottage , almost always white , surrounded by plots of land ringed with stone fences and , often , with stone remnants of a long abandoned home nearby . Carna has one street and a_couple_of stores , Moran ' s market and Geraghty ' s supermarket , with bushel_baskets out front heaped with packages of turf . There are , of course , the pubs . Popular are Mac ' s bar , whose Irish name is Tigh Mheaic , and the cheerful bar in Moran ' s , whose name is Tigh Mhorain . The village is a wonderful place to hear Irish music almost every night in any of the pubs . One night we attended an Irish dance , known as celi , in the high_school gym . I captured the joyous musicians with their whistles and drums on my tape_recorder . My wife was delightfully shocked when the mayor , a man broad of shoulder and light on his feet , invited her to be his partner in a traditional dance set . During July there are numerous local festivals bouncing with Irish music and colorful traditional dances in the Carna area . One of the most unusual is the celebration of &quot; St . Mac Dara ' s Day , &quot; July 16 . Saint Mac Dara , the patron_saint of Carna , lived_on a nearby island . A pilgrimage goes_to the island to hold a Mass , watch boat_races and celebrate . The island ' s St . Mac Dara chapel dates_back to the 6th Century , the same century the region was swept into Catholicism . The chapel was restored in 1975 . Ashore , all_of Carna celebrates . Visitors will recognize how important the holiday is because the pubs , which normally close around 11 p.m. , on this night are allowed by law to stay open as long as the stout flows and the violins , drums and tin_whistles play . The best-known festival in Connemara , however , is the annual Connemara pony show in Clifden , this year on Aug . 18 . Legend has it that these sturdy , powerful small horses descended from Arabian horses that swam ashore after_part of the Spanish_Armada was destroyed in storms nearby . The breeders range from farmers to aristocrats , but they share one thing besides their love of the ponies -- a love of Guinness . The most spectacular mountains in Connemara are the steep and treeless Twelve Bens -- sometimes called Twelve Pins -- a cluster of 2 # 000-plus foot peaks about 15 miles north of Carna as the endangered , protected raven flies , but twice that far on the twisting road that follows the rock-strewn coast . There are several well-marked hiking trails in Connemara National_Park , a small section of the Pins , with exhilarating views of bogs , lakes , ocean and mountains . Clifden , with a population of perhaps 1 # 000 , about 25 miles from Glinsk , has shops offering a remarkable selection of local art and handmade Irish tweed clothing . We were especially pleased with the quality and variety at the Celtic Shop ( in the nearby village of Spiddal , we found similar quality at Standun ) . Four miles from Clifden are several towering radio masts where Guglielmo Marconi operated the first commercially reliable two-way transatlantic telephone_service , and , nearby , a monument marks an almost forgotten epic in aviation history . Here in 1919 , two aviators , John Alcock and Arthur Brown , landed their biplane in the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic , flying from Newfoundland to Ireland . Both sites are_well marked . Beyond being awed by the coast , visiting imposing ruins and prowling through shops in the few villages , visitors can fish for trout on lakes scattered throughout the area , go_to sea in chartered fishing_boats for about $ 25 per person , and hike over mountains , across bogs or along the coast to watch the seals . At almost every tiny port , boats are available for hire to visit islands . Golfers who wish to challenge the always breezy Connemara Golf_Club overlooking the Atlantic near Clifden be warned : It is a point_of_honor to play through , whether hail or gale . Several villages have free tennis_courts . Excellent horsewomen , our then 15-year-old daughters quickly spotted roadside signs at several horse liveries along the coastal roads . Weather permitting , they galloped along the beaches , their red hair flying in the wind , or took trail rides into the mountains almost daily for about $ 4 an hour . The scattered beaches are fine for picnicking , but the waters , even in mid-summer , are chilly for swimming . On the coast road a dozen miles north of Carna lies one of the most elegant country hotels in all Ireland , the Cashel House . Its 50 acres of rare and colorful flowering gardens have won both praise and awards . It commemorates with unabashed pride in its printed literature when the late Gen . and Mrs . Charles de Gaulle spent a two-week vacation there in 1969 . In addition to an outstanding riding_school , the hotel stables breed Connemara ponies and offer guided pony treks into the mountains or across the bogs . At the hotel there are also tennis_courts , croquet , billiards and a tiny ocean-side beach , which is a pleasant walk away . We found the Cashel House restaurant to be visually stunning , with polished wood and gleaming brass . Unfortunately , our meal of lamb and fish was merely acceptable , especially considering the price . Dinner for four , with wine and tip , was $ 210 . Not far from Cashel House is the Zetland House hotel , smaller but equally charming and in the same price range ( about $ 95 in summer ) . It is_well worth a special visit to its truly wonderful restaurant , where we dined on superb lamb and beautifully done salmon . Our dinner tab for four , including wine , tip , and a magnificent view of the nearby ocean , was $ 190 . If meal prices seem high for such a rural_area , it should also be pointed_out that dinner in local restaurants and pubs will range from $ 6 to $ 10 . A cheerful &quot; pint &quot; of heady dark_beer is extra . But to touch the intimate heart of the people , stuff yourself on hearty portions of Irish home cooking , and hear endless tales of this mystical corner of Ireland , then you must spend a_few days of casual B &amp; B touring . Technique : Drive_in any direction on any road , from coast to mountains , until you see a &quot; B &amp; B &quot; sign_in front of a home that pleases your taste . All are clean and pleasant , some are antique and beautiful . The Irish love_children , and so do the B &amp; Bs . Occasionally something wonderful happens by accident in Connemara . This is the way we stumbled upon Janny Levin ' s modest booklet , &quot; Discover Carna , A Guide for Visitors &quot; ( published in 1991 ) , under a stack of magazines at Geraghty ' s supermarket in Carna . We paid about $ 2.25 and found it to be an invaluable guide to the charms of the area . In 16 pages of amiable text and hand-drawn maps -- all place_names in both Gaelic and English -- it told us where to gather mussels and periwinkles , spot seals , find orchids , watch heron and curlew , and go_on memorable walks in both bog and mountain . Almost more significantly : for readers with further questions , the author lists his personal telephone_number in the book . . . an illustration of just how small and friendly this part of Ireland is .
