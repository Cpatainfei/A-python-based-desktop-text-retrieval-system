   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : IRVINE ; COUNCIL ADOPTS ETHICS CODE , ' WHISTLE-BLOWER ' PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The city has adopted its first formal code of ethics and &quot; whistle-blower &quot; resolution . City_Council members said that Orange County ' s troubled economic times underscore their belief that the time is right to institutionalize ethical behavior . The new code , which governs everything from the private use of telephones by city employees to acceptance of gifts from members of the public , is based on a 1990 memorandum on ethics created by City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . &quot; Mr. Brady already had guidelines for his staff people , which were very good , &quot; said Lowell Johnson , an aerospace worker on the five-member citizens ' committee that helped shape the new ethics code . &quot; We had some good debates on what ethics really is . It was tough. &quot; Councilman Greg Smith was first to suggest that the city create a formal code of ethics , citing concerns raised by members of the city ' s Safe Community Task_Force . &quot; One of the points that came_out of that task_force was that there is a real crisis in ethics , &quot; Smith said . &quot; Not only in the community , but throughout the country. &quot; The new ethics code tells employees that &quot; high ethical standards &quot; are more important than loyalty to co-workers or department_heads . The code was accompanied by a resolution affirming state law that protects employees from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing . The whistle-blower resolution was prompted by Mark Petracca , a UC Irvine social_science professor who says it did not go_far enough . &quot; It ' s good , but it ' s not good_enough , &quot; Petracca said . &quot; What I was looking_for was a proactive apparatus that would actively encourage people as a matter_of_course to be whistle-blowers. &quot; With such a policy in place , Petracca said , some city employees might have been encouraged to question the city ' s decision to borrow additional money to invest in the county portfolio . &quot; What incentive would anybody in the city have had to raise a question about whether or not that was proper ? &quot; Petracca said . &quot; No one would have had that incentive. &quot; But Petracca applauds the city ' s new ethics code , which addresses what he believes is a national concern about the behavior of officials at all levels in government_agencies . Gene Bedley , an Irvine elementary_school principal and member of the citizens ' committee that formed the new code of ethics , said people are struggling to create a standard for ethical behavior at all levels of society . &quot; A lot of people don ' t really understand what the word ethics means , &quot; said Bedley , author of several books on &quot; values-based &quot; education . &quot; What we tried to do is to say that the city must go beyond its laws to form a code of ethics. &quot; RUSS LOAR</TEXT>
