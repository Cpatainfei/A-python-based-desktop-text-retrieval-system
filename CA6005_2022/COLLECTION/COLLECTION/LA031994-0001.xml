   <HEADLINE> ARAB NATIONS AGREE TO RESUME PEACE TALKS WITH ISRAEL ; MIDEAST : U.N. SECURITY_COUNCIL ' S VOTE TO CONDEMN HEBRON MASSACRE BRINGS SYRIA , LEBANON AND JORDAN BACK TO THE TABLE . CHRISTOPHER SAYS PLO MAY SOON FOLLOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Syria , Lebanon and Jordan agreed Friday to resume peace talks with Israel after the U.N. Security_Council approved a resolution condemning the massacre of Palestinians in a West_Bank mosque . The U.N. action also let the Palestine Liberation Organization inch toward renewed negotiations with the Israelis . Moments after the resolution was adopted , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told a news_conference here that &quot; a senior-level meeting between Israel and the PLO will take_place soon &quot; and &quot; it is the expectation that these discussions will lead to early resumption of negotiations. &quot; But Friday ' s announcement reflected a seeming defeat for the Clinton_Administration in its tug of war with the PLO over the resolution . American officials had threatened to veto the measure unless PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed to an immediate resumption of negotiations . But the PLO refused , insisting that it wanted the United Nations to condemn the massacre without conditions . The PLO -- after making a highly publicized breakthrough in the Middle_East peace process with Israel last fall -- broke_off talks on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and the West_Bank city of Jericho after an Israeli settler gunned_down about 30 praying Palestinians in the mosque of the Cave of the Partriarchs in Hebron on Feb . 25 . At the United Nations , Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador , abstained on two paragraphs in the resolution but joined the 14 other Security_Council members in condemning the killings and calling_on Israel to take measures &quot; to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied territory. &quot; These measures , the resolution said , should include &quot; a temporary international or foreign presence &quot; -- a reference_to the possible stationing of outside observers in the occupied territories . Passage of the resolution , Christopher announced , let Syria , Lebanon and Jordan agree to resume their bilateral negotiations with Israel in April . The three Arab countries had suspended the talks after the Hebron massacre . Christopher said these negotiations , the impending PLO-Israel contacts and the dispatch of a State_Department team to consult with the parties in the Middle_East &quot; will move us toward putting the whole peace process back on track. &quot; Senior Administration officials said the decision to resume the talks between Israel and Syria , Lebanon and Jordan was galvanized by a phone_call Thursday in which President Clinton urged Syrian President Hafez Assad and the others to return to the negotiations . Assad phoned Clinton after noon Friday , the officials said , and told him that King Hussein of Jordan and Prime_Minister Rafik Hariri of Lebanon had agreed to resume talks . High-level telephone_calls were a feature of the day . Christopher said that Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin had called Arafat in Tunis , Tunisia , earlier in the day . In Jerusalem , Israeli officials said Rabin made the call to discuss resumption of peace negotiations . At the Americans ' insistence , the Security_Council voted on each paragraph of its resolution separately . The procedure let Albright register her objection by abstaining on two paragraphs without vetoing or abstaining on the entire resolution . &quot; It is precisely to serve and protect the peace process , &quot; she said , &quot; that my government has -- with great reluctance -- made the difficult decision to allow this resolution to pass today , despite the existence of some language we find objectionable. &quot; First , Albright said , &quot; we simply do not support the description of territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 War as ' occupied Palestinian territory. ' &quot; She said &quot; this language could be taken_to indicate sovereignty , &quot; a matter that Israel and the PLO , in their Declaration of Principles signed_in Washington on Sept . 13 , agreed would be taken_up in later negotiations . Second , she said she objected to the description of Jerusalem as an occupied territory of Israel since &quot; Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues to be addressed in the negotiations. &quot; &quot; My government does not believe that it is helpful in the negotiations to include the kind of reference that is made to Jerusalem , &quot; she said . &quot; It could prejudice or prejudge the outcome of negotiations. &quot; She told the Security_Council that the United States had decided that it would not veto the resolution because the offending language was in the preamble rather than in its key operating paragraphs . Those key paragraphs -- introduced by France , Britain , Spain , Russia and Djibouti : * Strongly condemned &quot; the massacre in Hebron and its aftermath. &quot; * Called_on Israel &quot; to continue to take and implement measures , including . . . confiscation of arms , with the aim of preventing illegal acts of violence by Israeli settlers. &quot; * Sought measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied territory including . . . a temporary international or foreign presence. &quot; * Recommended the implementation of the Declaration of Principles . In Jerusalem , a senior Israeli official said the 15-minute discussion between Rabin and Arafat was largely &quot; one of negatives. &quot; The Israeli leader told Arafat that he could not meet the full PLO demands but &quot; would only do what he could &quot; -- and expected Arafat to recognize his own political needs within Israel . Rabin outlined the measures -- including the banning of extremist Jewish groups and the detention without trial of their leaders -- that he had already taken_to curb violence by Israeli settlers in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip against Palestinian residents , according to Israeli officials . Rabin pledged follow-up action next week . Plans for a meeting between Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were discussed , according to Israeli officials , and the meeting could come early next week in Cairo . &quot; The suitcases are not yet packed , &quot; Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid cautioned . &quot; But there is a possibility , a strong one , that such a meeting will take_place soon , and with it full negotiations would follow. &quot; In his talk with Arafat , Rabin reportedly said Israel would not pull its 450 settlers out of the West_Bank town of Hebron but would take steps to gather them into one or two groups in the town or in the adjacent settlement of Kiryat Arba , reducing the friction with Palestinians and making_it easier for Israeli forces to protect settlers . Israeli officials said Rabin emphasized the need to implement the basic agreement between his government and the PLO on Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho District in the West_Bank . The sources also said Rabin told Arafat that the Israeli army is already moving large_numbers of troops out of Gaza and regrouping those that remain around the Jewish settlements there . But he warned that the steps could be reversed if the negotiations stall . Peres , meanwhile , met with Faisal Husseini , the senior PLO leader in Jerusalem , to argue for resumption of the talks , despite strong sentiment against it in the West_Bank . Israel said it hoped the Security_Council resolution would bring the rapid resumption of talks with the PLO on Palestinian self-government as well as peace negotiations with neighboring Arab states . &quot; Israel believes the best way to promote peace and security between Israelis and Palestinians is by resuming and accelerating negotiations on the implementation of the ( Declaration of Principles ) on Gaza and Jericho , &quot; Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Uriel Palti said . &quot; In regard_to the Security_Council resolution , Israel hopes it will pave the way for the resumption of these talks with the PLO. &quot; Palti noted : &quot; Israel was first to condemn the horrendous massacre in Hebron and will continue to take decisive actions against extremist and dangerous elements . &quot; Israel will encourage any measures to restore stability in the territories as far as they are in conformity with the Declaration of Principles , &quot; Palti said , &quot; and it will do its utmost to carry_out its responsibility for the security of all Arabs and Israelis in the territories. &quot; Meisler reported from Washington and Parks from Jerusalem . Times staff writers Doyle McManus and Norman Kempster contributed to this report from Washington . Words of Condemnation Here is the text of the resolution adopted by the U.N. Security_Council .
