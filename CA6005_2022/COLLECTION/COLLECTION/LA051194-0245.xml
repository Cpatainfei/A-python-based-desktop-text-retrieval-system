   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : STILL FRETTING FOR THE ECONOMY ? JUST LOOK_AT THE AUTO BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Panic is caused by unstable prices and short memory . Turmoil in the financial markets is leading otherwise sensible people to lose their balance and to doubt the strength of the real economy . The Federal_Reserve_Board is criticized for acting too quickly or too slowly on interest_rates ; inflation or recession or both are coming , cry the doomsayers . Reality is more complex and encouraging . The economy is truly strong and likely to be so for four or five years -- as can be seen from a good look_at the automobile business . That most basic and evocative American industry is in its best shape in two decades and offers an excellent example of trends in the real economy . But first , turmoil in financial markets may continue for a month or two . Stock and bond prices are bouncing around -- they rose Tuesday after a deep dive Monday -- not really because of inflation or Fed policy , but because billions of dollars of speculation in U.S. Treasury_notes and bonds is being liquidated by big-money investors who borrowed heavily to play in the government_bond markets . that ' s unnerving and affects interest_rates for business , housing and personal_loans . But such effects are temporary , as history shows . Similar bond market turmoil occurred in 1958 , reports James Grant , editor of Grant ' s Interest_Rate Observer , in the &quot; ostensibly serene years of the second Eisenhower Administration. &quot; Then as now , Grant relates , investors borrowed money to play the spread between low short-term interest_rates and high long-term rates . Corporations , too , sought to pick_up a quick buck speculating on interest_rates -- as Procter &amp; Gamble and others have done recently in derivatives . But all were confounded when Treasury_bill rates rose from 1 % in the summer of 1958 to 4 % a year later . Yet back then , the stock_market went right on rising and the real economy started its long , healthy , non-inflationary march through the first_half of the 1960s . Rising interest_rates didn ' t stop the economy then . Nor is business_activity slowing today . On the contrary , banks are lending to small business again for the first time since 1990 . And they are pushing car loans for the first time in more_than a decade . Which brings us to the car business . U.S. car and truck sales are running at an annual rate of 15.5 million vehicles , which is almost historic . But most experts think sales will go even higher in the next few years . Chrysler and Ford are selling everything they make and expanding capacity . Furthermore , they have dramatically improved operations . Chrysler developed the new Neon in just 31 months ; Ford is unifying its manufacturing worldwide . General Motors is doing better than it has in a decade , with further product improvements coming_in the next few years . Demand is so heavy that Japanese car_makers , whose prices have been forced up by the high yen , nonetheless are having a good year because leasing deals are moving cars for them . Yet auto stocks are down -- Chrysler from $ 61 a share to about $ 46 currently , Ford from more_than $ 70 a share to about $ 59 , and General Motors from $ 65 to $ 55 -- because rising interest_rates have frightened the stock_market . Investors think higher rates will slow car buying . But a look_at the numbers tells you that ' s not so , says analyst Joseph Phillippi of Lehman Bros . &quot; These higher rates will add about $ 7 a month to the average car loan payment , &quot; Phillippi says . &quot; That won ' t stop this car rally. &quot; A relatively new wrinkle , leasing , is moving cars out of showrooms . Individual leases , as opposed to company fleet deals , now account_for more_than one-fifth of all new cars purchased , says Doug Kevorkian , an automotive consultant in Ann Arbor , Mich . More_than half of all luxury cars are leased , he adds , because leases allow_for lower down_payments and often lower monthly payments than a conventional loan . One reason is that manufacturers subsidize leases through their finance_companies , which leads some on Wall_Street to worry about future write-offs if car values at the end of the leases are lower than financiers had predicted . The effect on the used car market is also imponderable . Like so_much else in America , the car business is changing . The rise of leasing , which experts think will level_off at one-third of all cars sold , reflects different lifestyles . Many people like the idea of hassle-free service and a new luxury car every two years . Auto_companies and dealers , in turn , like the idea of customers coming_back all_the time for repairs or a new lease . So cars will become somewhat like housing , where many people rent their homes . There will be financial innovation as markets develop automobile loan paper similar to mortgage pass-through certificates . There is one shadow on the rosy picture . U.S. car_makers have taken_advantage of their Japanese competitors ' problems with the yen to raise prices themselves , taking profit today rather than market share for tomorrow . That could come_back to haunt them , because U.S. auto_makers are still a hair behind Toyota and Nissan , which can go from drawing board to finished car in 30 months . So it remains a competitive world . Still , Detroit in the next few years will move a lot of iron , as they say , and other industries will move a lot of merchandise and services too . The economy ' s strength is real . But that doesn ' t necessarily mean a bull_market , says master investor Peter Lynch of Fidelity Investments . The next 12 months could see a further 12 % decline in_stock prices , Lynch said recently in Barron ' s . Such a bear_market -- a decline of about 25 % in major stock averages -- has occurred every six years throughout this century . Yet even that would n ' t stop profits of most U.S. companies from rising . And that ' s the reality that will drive stock prices higher over the next four to five years , Lynch said -- demonstrating that a long memory and a calm perspective are keys to understanding and investment success , especially in these panicky times .</TEXT>
