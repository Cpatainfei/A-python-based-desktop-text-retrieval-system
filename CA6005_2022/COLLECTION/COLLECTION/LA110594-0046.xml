   <HEADLINE> POPE BLASTS MAFIA IN WEEKEND SICILY VISIT ; ITALY : JOHN PAUL URGES CITIZENS TO ' RISE_UP ' AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME . THE TRIP WILL TEST HIS RECOVERY FROM A LEG INJURY IN APRIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inveterate traveler Pope John Paul II went_back_on the road Friday , launching a barnstorming weekend through Sicily that promises to be a test for his slow-healing leg and a trial for the Mafia . &quot; Catania , rise_up and cloak yourself in light and justice , &quot; the Pope urged Friday night in a strong-voiced opening sally against organized_crime at a meeting with citizens in front of a cathedral that was begun 900 years ago . History ' s highest-mileage Pope flew to Catania from Rome on a muggy , hazy evening to keep a promise . He had planned to visit at the end of April but broke his right leg in a bathroom fall at his Vatican apartment the night before he was to leave . Mounted anew on his Popemobile on Friday , he waved to happy crowds lining the streets of this prosperous but Mafia-beset port city overlooked by the brooding mass of Mt . Etna , Europe ' s biggest volcano . &quot; Too often and for too long the children of this community have suffered the humiliation of being written_off as residents of a decayed and violent city , dominated by organized_crime and made unlivable , &quot; the Pope thundered . John Paul brought an appeal for action on his first call_in Catania and his first in Sicily since May , 1993 , when he lambasted the Mafia in one of the strongest addresses of his papacy . With a large and friendly crowd cheering his every move Friday , the 74-year-old pontiff returned immediately to the hunt . &quot; My thoughts are with your community on its difficult and tiring road to moral and social growth , hoping to find a new harmony , leaving_behind the forms of suffocation and corruption manipulated by some at the expense of many , &quot; he told Sicilians . The Pope dismisses organized crime , a stubborn and deeply rooted fact of Sicilian life , with the scorn he reserves for issues such_as abortion and euthanasia . Silence will not do , the Pope says . He demands that Sicilians rise_up in active opposition . &quot; Time is running_out and does not allow inert waiting or timorous mediocrity , &quot; he said in a speech based on Christ ' s biblical response to a cripple who asked_for help : &quot; Rise_up and walk. &quot; It was John Paul ' s first venture beyond Vatican walls since he canceled an October visit to the United States to allow further time for recuperation . Since then , he has worked a full load as an administrator but skipped a number of scheduled pastoral events that would have kept him on his feet for extended periods . Arriving in Catania on an Italian air_force executive jet , John Paul descended the steep nine steps from the plane with fierce concentration , grasping handrails in both hands and placing both feet on each step , one deliberate shuffle after another . John Paul ' s Sicilian visit has been pruned to accommodate his leg . He will say Mass here this morning and , after a fairly relaxed day , will journey to the ancient city of Syracuse , where he will dedicate a shrine Sunday before returning that night to Rome .</TEXT>
