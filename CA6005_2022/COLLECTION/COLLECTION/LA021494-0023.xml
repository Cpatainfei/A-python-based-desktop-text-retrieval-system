   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TESTIMONY ; ONE PERSON ' S STORY ABOUT CHINESE IN AMERICA ; ' THEY DON ' T THINK THEY NEED TO CHANGE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joseph Jinn , 37 , arrived in America nine years ago and for the past four years has been a popular anchor of the Chinese - language news_show on cable station KCSI . He was fired late last month in a dispute over his reporting of the visit to Los Angeles by Taiwan ' s premier , Chan Lien . In Southern California we have around 500 # 000 to 600 # 000 overseas Chinese that are from Taiwan . People tell me that at least another 100 # 000 have come directly from the mainland . This is a big community . Taiwan is so close . From Los Angeles to Taiwan , it ' s 15 hours . And because the interaction is so frequent , the Southern Californian Chinese community cannot just say , &quot; We are Chinese , we need to do some assimilation . . . &quot; Assimilation is very , very hard , because so many -- 60 % -- are new immigrants . They have money , they have businesses , they are a really big community . If you ' ve been to San Gabriel you know . They don ' t need to speak English , really ; they don ' t need to go_to the American supermarket . They ' re bringing over a lot of habits from Taiwan . They don ' t have to adapt . People can live their life well here ; they can have their Chinese life . Last week was the Chinese New Year ; you could go_to Monterey Park and San Gabriel and celebrate the Chinese New Year in your own way . They don ' t want to change ; they don ' t think they need to change . A phenomenal thing is that even when the economic situation is so bad in the whole nation , the Chinese community here is not affected . Because they can sustain themselves so well . They buy things from the Chinese-owned market . They sell things to Taiwan and to mainland_China . They bring_in money from Taiwan . A lot of people still have family in Taiwan , they still have businesses in Taiwan . They buy and sell stocks in Taiwan , get rich and come_to the United States and buy a house here and stay here , and then fly back to Taiwan and make some money and come_back . It ' s a common practice . So even when the economy is so bad here , the Chinese community is never affected . You see how many Mercedes-Benz are being driven_around ( by Chinese people ) ? In recent years the Chinese American community has become more complex than ever before . The Southern California Chinese community is a miniature model of Taiwan ; it is an extension of Taiwan ' s political struggle . In 1949 the Kuomintang government fled mainland_China to Taiwan and many people from mainland_China were expatriated to Taiwan . Conflict between these expatriates and the original Taiwanese who were born there has grown bigger and bigger ever since . Some people from Taiwan are pro-Taiwanese independence , for example , ( as opposed to reunification with mainland_China ) , and these tensions are carried_over into Southern California . And so the handling of the news , especially in the Chinese community , requires special sensitivity in_regards_to the story itself -- the way you report . I ' m Chinese , I know how and what I should write_about , what I should report about , the way I should handle the news . I know the nuances , the differences , and I know how to handle them correctly . However , the station , the American boss -- KSCI is owned by Citicorp -- sometimes they don ' t appreciate that sensitivity . Like in my situation . I did a report that didn ' t please certain parties . I did a report about the Jan . 24 reception for Taiwanese Premier Chan Lien and I was a bit critical , a little sarcastic . I said the tables at the party were not fully filled , and I said the premier was received by former President Reagan -- and I also noted that , actually , Reagan is not that difficult to visit ! I said that because the relationship between Taiwan and the United States is so subtle -- there is no formal diplomatic relationship -- Premier Lien ' s visit to L.A. was very difficult and so it was played it low-key . Because the station got a complaint , just a partial complaint from a very small section of the Chinese community , I was fired . The station thought that complaint represented a whole segment of the Chinese community ' s opinion . that ' s totally wrong . In the Chinese community , you just cannot write anything that will be totally accepted by all sides , because of that complexity I just told you about . The major media in the Chinese community have a tendency to be friendly to the Taiwanese government . They are influenced by certain ( economic powers ) from Taiwan , some political interests from Taiwan . that ' s why the people here always complain they cannot get candid reports from the Chinese media . As a reporter , I ' ve been trying very hard to do that . To balance that . that ' s why I got viewer support not only from people from Taiwan , but also people from mainland_China . And this is very difficult . I ' m very appreciative of their support , I ' m very proud_of it , because the rule here is if you work for a media ( outlet ) which is pro-Taiwan government , it is very hard to get the support or recognition of readers from mainland_China , and vice versa . And I did that . My dismissal will have a chilling effect on the future of unbiased , independent , candid reporting in the Chinese community . I was kind of naive , thinking , &quot; I ' m employed by an American TV_station , so this can be an example ; we can do independent news_reporting here . However , 90 % of the show ' s sponsors were Taiwanese businesses , so you still felt a lot of influence out there . that ' s why things happened the way they did . This is a big community . And how to serve the community , how to inform them takes a lot of courage , a lot of determination . We have a long way to go.THEODORA LITSIOS / For The Times</TEXT>
