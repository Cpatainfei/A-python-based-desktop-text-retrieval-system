   <HEADLINE> RENEWED SELLING SPREE CLOBBERS BOND MARKET ; INTEREST_RATES : ANALYSTS WONDER WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO LURE BUYERS BACK INTO MARKET , AS SECURITIES CONTINUE TO PLUMMET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another wave of selling swept the bond market Monday , sending long-term yields to 15-month highs and raising fears of even higher rates ahead , as the badly pummeled market searches desperately for buyers . The yield on 30-year Treasury_bonds , which had rocketed from 7.08 % last Thursday to 7.26 % on Friday on news of a surge in March employment , zoomed to 7.40 % by Monday ' s close -- its highest since 7.47 % on Jan . 13 , 1993 . The mood among bond traders and analysts around the country was one of stunned disbelief , as_many of them wondered aloud what it would take_to lure buyers back to fixed-income securities . Worse , many pros fear a new round of selling today , as millions of bond mutual_fund investors see the biggest one-day losses in years in their fund shares . Fund prices Monday reflected not only Monday ' s trading but also accumulated losses from Friday ' s slump in bond values . Mutual_funds did not officially trade Friday , even though bonds were traded among some investors . &quot; This is one of the sharpest selloffs I ' ve ever experienced , &quot; said Gerald Guild , a veteran bond trader at Advest Group in New York , reflecting on the market ' s ongoing massacre . Potential buyers , he said , &quot; have their hands in their pockets , &quot; and most refuse to step_up and bid for bonds of any type . As bond prices drop , their yields soar . Just three months ago , the T-bond yield was at 6.35 % , and most bond traders did not expect that yield to hit even 7 % until later this year . But the rebounding economy and rising inflation fears began to drive yields_up in January . That turnaround has become violent over the past month , as massive numbers of speculators who expected yields to slide in 1994 have attempted to sell bonds all at once -- only to find few takers . Ironically , some bond traders had hoped that the stock_market would plummet Monday morning , and that selling stock investors would reinvest in bonds , helping to pull yields lower . But the Dow industrial average held its loss to 42.61 points Monday , closing at 3 # 593.35 , even as bond yields surged . &quot; A lot of bond managers thought the stock_market would bail us out , but it didn ' t happen , &quot; said David Rosenberg , manager of the Oppenheimer U.S._Government Trust bond fund . Bond traders ' gloom was worsened by the market ' s inability to key off any good news . A plunge in most commodities Monday , which should have lessened inflation worries and allowed interest_rates to fall_back , failed to help bonds . The Commodity Research Bureau index of key commodities traded at a two-month low of 225.32 before closing_off 1.65 points , or 0.7 % , at 226.02. While gold led commodities ' slide , falling $ 5.50 to $ 386.30 an ounce , bond investors paid more attention to the continuing rebound in crude_oil prices . Oil futures jumped $ 1 to a two-month high of $ 15.79 a barrel on the New York Merc . Reports of unrest in Algeria helped spur the gain . The bond market also was fixated on an afternoon report from the Center for International Business_Cycle Research at Columbia University . The Center ' s inflation index rose to 107.1 in March from 106.7 in February , refueling fears that prices of goods and services are rising with the economy . That report overshadowed the National Assn . of Purchasing Management ' s monthly business survey , which showed that while the economy continued to expand in March , its pace cooled somewhat . Bond traders say the reluctance of buyers to come_forward in part reflects uncertainty about the strength of the economy and the potential for higher inflation . But they also say that the speed with which interest_rates have risen this year has surprised so many investors that they are too afraid to take_a_chance and buy bonds -- because the risk appears too great that yields will simply continue to rise in the short run . Worse , Wall_Street brokerages are increasingly unwilling to buy bonds from mutual_funds and other sellers , because the brokers have already lost so_much money on the bonds still in their inventories . One fund manager said that in soliciting bond bids from five brokerages Monday , two said outright that they would n ' t even name a price for the bonds . What is unclear now is whether bond mutual_funds have adequate cash on_hand to meet further potential redemptions by conservative shareholders , more of whom may decide they are losing too_much of their principal as market interest_rates rise and older fixed-rate bonds plunge in value . Long-term bond fund shares lost 1.5 % to 2.5 % of their value Monday . Some of the funds have lost as much as 10 % since last fall . &quot; The biggest concern I have is that ( other ) funds still don ' t have enough cash &quot; to meet exit requests , said one fund manager . If that ' s the case , rising redemptions could force fund managers to dump more bonds in the market , potentially sending interest_rates even higher . At some point buyers will return to the market , analysts say , but most have become unwilling to project how high yields will have to go_in the interim . It didn ' t help Monday that well-known Wall_Street economist Henry Kaufman suggested that bond yields might eventually reach 9 % or 10 % , though he said there would be a rally before that . In other markets Monday : * U.S. stocks finished broadly lower once again , though up from their worst levels of the day , as investors reacted to surging interest_rates and to growing fears that stocks have entered a bear_market . The Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index slumped 6.85 points , or 1.5 % , to 438.92. The Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks tumbled 16.05 points , or 2.2 % , to 727.41. The S &amp; P now is off 8.9 % from its peak ; the Nasdaq index is off 9.5 % . Losing issues swamped winners 21 to 4 on the Big Board , on heavy volume of 344 million shares . * Latin_American stocks dove , reflecting Wall_Street ' s woes and rising interest_rates . In Mexico_City , the Bolsa index plummeted 144.89 points , or 6 % , to 2 # 265.49. Argentina ' s market was off 8.4 % and Brazil ' s key index lost 10.6 % . * MAIN STORY : A1 Big Losses in Bond Funds Shares of bond mutual_funds posted some of their largest one-day losses in years on Monday , as soaring market interest_rates devalued older bonds .
