   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT , RABIN VOW TO EXPAND PLO AUTONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization , pleased with progress in establishing Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip , agreed Wednesday to expand the autonomy , step by step , throughout the West_Bank and end the Israeli occupation there . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat decided in talks here to transfer responsibility for a range of government services , including education , health and welfare , to the new Palestinian Authority . But they acknowledged that difficult issues will have to be resolved . &quot; A fresh impulse was given to peace by Israelis and Palestinians , &quot; Arafat told reporters after the two leaders met for the first time since May . &quot; The meeting was positive , fruitful . . . . We agreed on some major issues , and some_other issues will require more discussions. &quot; The issues include some of the most difficult the two sides will face in reaching a full Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement : their borders ; the long-term presence of Israeli forces and settlements on the West_Bank ; and the future of Jerusalem , claimed by both as their capital . Rabin urged commitment and caution . &quot; We are entering one of the more decisive stages on the way to reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians , &quot; he said . &quot; This is the stage where we end our dreaming . The time has come now to roll_up our sleeves. &quot; Arafat , who heads the new Palestinian Authority , promised to hold &quot; free , honest and democratic elections as quickly as possible &quot; in expanding Palestinian self-government . But he did not confirm mid-October as the target date for the vote , which will be the Palestinians ' first national election . Wednesday ' s discussions between Israeli and Palestinian officials were described by both as broad and strategic , an effort to set the agenda for the next phase_in the peace effort and to fix a timetable for the new measures . But the two sides also dealt with very specific , very sensitive issues , including : the release , requested by Arafat , of the imprisoned leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas ; freedom for more_than 5 # 000 other Palestinian prisoners still held by Israel ; and enlargement of the Jericho district in the West_Bank as part of the autonomous area . Arafat and Rabin , speaking separately after an initial two hours of talks , said they had created three committees to discuss unresolved issues on autonomy for Gaza and Jericho , the transfer of civilian administration to the Palestinians in the rest of the West_Bank , and convening a conference with Egypt and Jordan on Palestinian refugees from the 1967 Middle_East War . Shimon Peres , the Israeli foreign_minister , said that even expansion of the Palestinian Authority ' s powers was complicated because it raised the question of who would enforce its decisions in areas still under Israeli military occupation . Yet both sides appeared encouraged by the successful transfer of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho district to the Palestinians and Arafat ' s establishment this week of the first Palestinian government . &quot; A creative spirit has nourished and inspired this process , and it has led to opening the door of genuine peace to one of the most complex conflicts of this century , &quot; Arafat said , speaking at a U.N. ceremony honoring him , Rabin and Peres with the UNESCO peace prize for their breakthrough agreement last year . Henry A . Kissinger , former U.S. secretary_of_state and head of the UNESCO prize jury , handed_out awards worth almost $ 50 # 000 for each winner . Kissinger , who avoided talks with Arafat during his Middle_East diplomacy in the 1970s , shook the PLO leader ' s hands as the crowd cheered . Arafat again appealed for economic assistance to the new Palestinian Authority . Wealthy nations should &quot; assume their moral , political and material responsibilities , &quot; or &quot; the peace process , however noble and important it may be , will be liable to collapse , &quot; he said . French President Francois Mitterrand , who met with Arafat and Rabin , said later that it would be tragic if financial problems thwart the peace process . He said he would press , at this weekend ' s summit of leaders of the seven leading industrialized nations , for the release of more of the $ 2.4 billion that has been promised for Palestinian autonomy . Rabin , speaking in Hebrew with Israelis as his primary audience , recounted the deaths of three of four sons of a prominent Israeli family , followed by their parents ' deaths . Replying to right-wing critics at_home , he addressed the surviving son -- and through him all families who have suffered through the long Arab-Israeli conflict -- declaring : &quot; For you , for our children and their children , we are moving toward peace . . . . That is our vow to you. &quot;</TEXT>
