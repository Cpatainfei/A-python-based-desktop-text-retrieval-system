   <HEADLINE> UNION ' S FOCUS ON FIELDS STARTS TO BEAR FRUIT ; LABOR : SINCE RETURNING TO GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZING THIS SPRING , UNITED FARM_WORKERS HAS SURPRISED GROWERS WITH ELECTION WINS AND NEW CONTRACTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the United Farm_Workers union marched from Delano to Sacramento in April to announce a return to organizing campesinos in the fields , many growers throughout the state derided the event as a publicity stunt with more bark than bite . But in the months since the pilgrimage , the UFW appears to be making_good on its promise . It has won three elections outright and possibly a fourth at fruit and vegetable companies from Coachella to Kings County involving more_than 1 # 000 workers . It has negotiated two new contracts -- one with a Coachella table grape grower , the first grape contract_in nearly a decade . And the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board , mostly silent in recent years , has filed more_than a dozen complaints since May against growers who allegedly refused to bargain in good_faith -- a clear response to the renewed field activity . While these gains may be small in the overall picture and no one is claiming the union has recaptured its old_glory , at least some growers are looking over their shoulders at the UFW ' s growing shadow . &quot; I do see a heightened level of concern among our growers now that the UFW has returned to organizing , &quot; said Richard Matoian , head of the California Grape and Tree Fruit League , which represents 350 growers from Coachella to Mendocino . &quot; No one is panicking , but I ' d say the industry is_on guard. &quot; The biggest aftershock seems to have come from the UFW ' s lopsided victory last month at Warmerdam farms in Kings County , which is just north of Kern County . Of the 263 workers who cast ballots , 220 voted for the union . The state labor officials who oversaw the election were said to have been stunned . The Warmerdams had been criticized for losing touch with their work_force and using abusive labor contractors or middlemen to deal with the workers . &quot; It caught us by surprise , &quot; said Bill Warmerdam , a third-generation fruit grower who conceded that his critics may be partly right . &quot; We ' re still trying to figure_out what happened. &quot; UFW President Arturo Rodriguez said the vote was the union ' s first-ever victory in Kings County . &quot; It was a major , major accomplishment for us , &quot; said the 44-year-old Rodriguez , the son-in-law of the late Cesar Chavez , who led the UFW for its first 30 years . &quot; The workers at Warmerdam did_it all . They took the message that every worker is an organizer . They are the ones who formed the committees and signed_up their co-workers. &quot; None of this seemed possible just months ago with the UFW reeling from a decade of losses and the sudden_death of Chavez . Even some longtime supporters found little reason for optimism . In the early 1970s , the UFW had contracts with 80 % of the grape growers in the San Joaquin Valley . Two decades later , not a single contract remained . The union had retreated from the fields , former top organizers complained . Its almost singular reliance on the table grape boycott and the issue of toxic pesticides was doing little to improve the lot of farm_workers , they said . While publicly dismissing the criticism , Rodriguez , co-founder Dolores Huerta and others huddled in strategy sessions at the UFW ' s La Paz compound in the Tehachapi Mountains 100 miles north of Los Angeles . They emerged this spring with a Delano-to-Sacramento pilgrimage that retraced the path of the union ' s first trek 28 years earlier and announced a major shift in strategy : No longer would the grape boycott be the centerpiece . The union would return to the difficult work of organizing farm laborers , enlisting new members , confronting growers and pushing for new elections and contracts . On the eve of the monthlong pilgrimage in April and at stops along the way , growers and farm groups dismissed the event as so_much nostalgia . &quot; It ' s the last gasp of a dying man , &quot; said Richard Baiz of the Grapeworkers and Farmers coalition , a longtime foe of the union . But in the three months since 10 # 000 supporters marched the final leg of the 330-mile trek to the steps of the state Capitol , UFW organizers have kept_up the pressure on growers and fruit companies up and down the state . There have been rallies at Dole Food Co . in Los Angeles and at Oceanview Produce in Oxnard . There have been picket_lines at date companies in Coachella and at vegetable farms in Salinas . There have been protests at the offices of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board , the state agency set_up to enforce a landmark 1975 law that gave farm_workers the right to collective_bargaining . The union argues that the board has served only the interests of growers during the Deukmejian and Wilson administrations . The dividends have been modest but real . In addition to Warmerdam farms in Kings County , the union won two elections last month at small date companies in Coachella . Before the UFW can actually represent workers at the three companies , the state labor board must certify the vote and dismiss any grower objections , which have been filed_in two of the cases . The UFW appears headed for a big victory at Oceanview Produce . Workers voted 275 to 231 in favor of the union , but the farm labor board has yet to certify the election because 87 additional votes are disputed . The company would have to win 66 of those votes to prevail . The labor board is reviewing the_matter . Because table grapes are a $ 750-million-a-year industry that relies heavily on field workers for pruning , thinning and picking , the success or failure of the UFW is often measured in its impact on grapes . Chavez waged his most bitter battles against the state ' s table grape giants . Grower Lionel Steinberg of David Freedman farms in Coachella said he expects to sign the first table grape contract_in nearly a decade with the UFW in the next few weeks . He is already honoring its terms , which include a wage increase from $ 5.80 to $ 6 an hour . &quot; We have not had a contract with a table grape grower for eight years , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; Even though ( Steinberg ) is not a large grower , this puts pressure on the rest of the industry . And it tells our organizers that if we can do_it in Coachella , we can do_it elsewhere. &quot; But others dismiss the importance of the Steinberg contract , pointing_out that the grower has been a longtime supporter of the UFW and that the new contract is merely a resumption of an older one that went_into hiatus because of a small dispute . &quot; Lionel Steinberg is hardly an example of a major victory , &quot; said Bruce Obbink of the California Table Grape Commission . &quot; The two sides just picked_up where they left_off several years back . It ' s another example of the UFW using smoke and mirrors to make things bigger than they are. &quot; Steinberg himself characterized the contract as a &quot; morale_booster &quot; to the UFW but agreed that other grape growers were much bigger quarry . &quot; This new agreement isn ' t much of a change in my relationship with the UFW , which began on April 10 , 1970 , when I was the first grower to sign a contract with Cesar Chavez. &quot; The union concedes that it will be harder pressed in the next few weeks as the harvest and picket_lines move north to Kern County , where the big table grape growers pay workers some of the better wages in the industry . &quot; We ' ve got a strategy for the San Joaquin Valley too , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; But it would be stupid of me to tip our hand. &quot; The union points to several key negotiations now taking_place with other growers around the state . And it highlights numbers from the state that show a significant rise in complaints against growers over allegedly unfair labor bargaining . Already , the farm labor board has issued nearly as_many complaints this year -- 25 -- as it did_in all_of last year . And a small staff with few resources is feeling the pinch . &quot; There is no question the UFW has been more active these last few months , &quot; said Don Pressley , Agricultural Labor Relations Board general counsel , who files the complaints . &quot; They have some very good people out_in the field who are giving their time . &quot; The question is whether or not they can sustain it . Whether or not they can win elections and get contracts . That remains to be seen. &quot;</TEXT>
