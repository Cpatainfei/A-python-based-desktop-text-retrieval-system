   <HEADLINE> LANDLORDS UNFAIRLY BEAR THE BURDEN OF DISASTER ; CALIFORNIA LAW HOLDS OWNERS OF APARTMENT_BUILDINGS LIABLE FOR LOSS IN CATASTROPHES LIKE THE JAN . 17 QUAKE . AN ATTORNEY ARGUES THAT THIS THREATENS THE BLAMELESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California authorities are rightly seeking to assess blame for the devastation that killed and injured so many of our neighbors in the Northridge earthquake in January . Investigators are trying to learn why purportedly reinforced freeways collapsed and why building inspectors are finding a pattern of faulty construction and design in destroyed and damaged buildings . In this period of reassessment of earthquake-related building policies , however , nothing is being said about a quirk in California law that literally allows the courts to blame the blameless -- owners of apartment_buildings -- for the injuries and deaths caused by quake-damaged buildings . Apartment_house owners may seem unlikely candidates for our compassion , but the reality is that California law requires that they shoulder the liability for design or construction defects that cause their buildings to fail and injure or kill people inside -- even when they bought the buildings long after they were built and had nothing to do with their design or construction . The owner of a single-family rental house that falls_down and kills everyone inside faces no such strict liability . Neither does the owner of the strip mall that caves_in and kills dozens , or the owner of a hospital that collapses and kills hundreds . Such owners who had nothing to do with the structure ' s design or construction will not be held strictly liable for the injuries or deaths even if it is determined that a construction or design defect contributed to the damage . But if any apartment_building gives_way , its present owner is liable for any injury or damage that results from a defect , even if he or she had nothing to do with its design or construction and was in fact the fourth , fifth or 10th owner of the building . The owner can attempt to recover all or part of the damages from those actually at_fault , such_as the architect and builder -- if they are still alive , are solvent and can be located . In general , when an injury occurs , the U.S. judicial_system holds responsible the person who caused the harm . This is liability based on fault . However , in products liability cases , the courts have carved out an exception whereby every person ever connected with the design , manufacture or sale of a product is held liable for any injury proved to be caused by the product ' s failure to perform as expected . This is known as strict liability . In 1985 , in Becker vs . IRM Corp. , the California Supreme Court expanded the scope of strict liability to apply to the owners of apartment_buildings . The Becker case means that even the 100th buyer of a building could be held liable for problems he never knew existed and could not have discovered even through reasonable inspection . The rationale behind Becker is that landlords are in the best position to bear the cost of injuries and can obtain insurance to protect themselves . Unfortunately , this reasoning does not acknowledge that insurance is expensive , that obtaining insurance to cover all eventualities is impossible and that rents are controlled by both the marketplace and rent control laws . As the attorney representing numerous owners of apartment_buildings damaged in the Northridge quake , I am witnessing the impact of this travesty firsthand . Some of my clients are large developers . But others are retired couples who planned their retirement around the income of a small apartment_house . They owned the buildings but had nothing to do with their design or construction . Yet they face years of litigation , huge damage claims and in some cases financial ruin -- all for alleged activities for which they are unquestionably blameless . * Imagine the implications of such a law in the aftermath of the catastrophic earthquake that so many experts predict for our state . Not only would we face unparalleled injury , death and destruction , but with that kind of liability , we would also face a future in which destroyed apartment_buildings would simply never be rebuilt . California is in the minority of states that impose strict liability on apartment owners . As the implications of this legal doctrine become clear as a result of this earthquake , we can expect the number of investors willing to risk everything to own apartment_buildings to shrink , which in turn will reduce an inadequate pool of affordable housing . During this period of rebuilding and reaffirming California ' s commitment to a healthy social and business environment , the public , Legislature and courts should re-examine the wisdom of singling_out apartment owners as the one group of real_estate owners somehow suited to be blamed when they are blameless .</TEXT>
