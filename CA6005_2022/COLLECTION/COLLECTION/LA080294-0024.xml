   <TEXT> Negotiators for Israel and Jordan will meet Thursday in an air-conditioned tent at Ein Evrona , a desert nature preserve on the Israeli side of the frontier , to discuss border problems . At stake are several thousand acres of land claimed by Jordan but currently cultivated by Israeli kibbutzim ( collective_farms ) .Land , water and travel rights are top subjects as the Middle_East neighbors enter a peaceful relationship . The two nations formally ended their 46-year-old state_of_war last week at a historic summit between Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein in Washington . Rabin and Hussein are tentatively scheduled to attend the opening of a new border crossing near the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat on Monday .
