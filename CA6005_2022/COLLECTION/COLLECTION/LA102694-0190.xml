   <TEXT> Carrie knew all about safe_sex . And she was cautious . When her friends began having_sex in high_school , she steadfastly refused . But , at 18 , she fell_in_love and decided it was OK because this boyfriend seemed so nice , so safe . They didn ' t even discuss condoms . Later , as the relationship faltered and Carrie learned more about her boyfriend ' s past , she decided to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases . After the exam , a clinic counselor told the tearful adolescent that she had chlamydia , the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the country , which often produces no symptoms in women but can cause sterility if left untreated . &quot; He was my first partner . He supposedly loved and cared about me . I guess I thought love would protect me , &quot; she says . What ' s disconcerting to health experts is that , even in the age of AIDS , there apparently are so many young Americans like Carrie : naive about the hazards of sex in the ' 90s -- and greatly at risk . Sexually transmitted diseases , or STDs , are flourishing in the United States . Several are thought to be at their highest rates ever . But what alarms health officials most is that teen-agers and young adults are now the primary victims of STDs . And STD infections , in turn , boost the risk of contracting the human_immunodeficiency_virus , becoming infertile or giving_birth to babies with health_problems . ( Most HIV-infected people contract the virus in their late teens and early 20s , according to statistics. ) Teen-age girls in particular have become more promiscuous in the last two decades , experts say . The problem stems in part , they say , from a dearth of educational materials and treatment programs for teen-agers and a reluctance by parents and doctors to deal honestly with young people regarding the do ' s and don ' ts of sex . The infection rates -- from age-old gonorrhea to newer scourges such_as chlamydia and human_papilloma_virus -- are highest among Americans ages 15 to 25 , and show little signs of abating . Of the 12 million new STD infections each year , two-thirds occur among people under 25 . And since young people are generally more promiscuous , less likely to use condoms , less likely to see a doctor and , among females , more biologically prone to STDs , they are the generation of Americans who stand to suffer the greatest consequences , experts say . Particularly puzzling is that this is happening when AIDS and safe_sex are universal discussion topics for all ages . But the message clearly is not getting_through , particularly to teen-agers . It is a predicament so disturbing to health officials that many are pleading for a restructuring of the nation ' s approach to controlling STDs to focus more on young people and sex education in addition to a consistent public-health effort to prevent disease . Experts note that , historically , when the federal_government has pumped money into syphilis and gonorrhea prevention , infection rates have dropped . But when the funds are reduced , they rage back . Federal funds have mainly targeted these two diseases , which largely affect adults , while STDs that affect younger people have received little attention from the government . According to experts , new tactics are long overdue . &quot; The AIDS epidemic is as bad as it is because we , as a culture , have not been good at dealing with sexuality , &quot; says Peggy Clarke , president of the American Social Health Assn. , the only non-government organization devoted to fighting STDs . &quot; Our rate of STDs is a national embarrassment . We are the only industrialized country in the world with so big a problem. &quot; The inadequate response can be traced to every sector , from the government to health_professionals to educators to parents , according to a 1993 report from The Alan Guttmacher Institute , a nonprofit corporation for research in policy specializing in reproductive health . &quot; How can this be happening in the age of AIDS ? &quot; asks Patricia Donovan , a senior associate at Guttmacher who wrote the report . Experts point to several factors that include : * An increasingly promiscuous society in which people begin having unprotected sex younger and have more partners during their &quot; unattached &quot; period -- often 10 to 20 years -- before they commit to one monogamous relationship . * Americans ' inability to talk_about sexuality and provide factual sex education in the home , schools and health_care settings , even though the culture is highly sexualized . * An antiquated approach to STDs by governments , health organizations and schools , which makes_it difficult for youths to get treatment , screening -- or even basic information . &quot; I ' m afraid . . . that people are not aware of the problem or don ' t believe it will happen to them , &quot; Donovan says . &quot; Teens , who are a particularly strong risk group , often make the judgment that their partner is clean even though they have no way in the world of knowing that. &quot; A look_at statistics shows high infection rates for young people in every STD category . For the first time , teen-age girls have the highest gonorrhea rates in the nation ; teen-age boys rank second . The rate in adolescent girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30 , according to the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . At least 10 % of sexually active teen-age girls have had gonorrhea . &quot; That teen-age girls are now the harbingers of this disease is amazing , &quot; says Deborah Howard , program coordinator of the STD / HIV Prevention Training Center in Long_Beach , a joint federal , state and city program to educate health_professionals about STDs . This is particularly scary , she says , because many girls in the 15 to 19 age_bracket do not come_in_for treatment -- meaning the incidence is probably greatly underreported . Adolescent rates for chlamydia , which can lead to pelvic_inflammatory_disease as well as infertility , range from 15 % to 37 % in females and are around 10 % in males . And , in several studies , 32 % to 46 % of sexually active teen-age girls were found to be infected with human_papilloma_virus , most of them carrying a strain that can cause cervical cancer . Nationwide , one in four sexually active adolescents will become infected with an STD by age 19 , says Dr. Adele Dellenbaugh Hofmann , a professor of adolescent medicine at UC Irvine . Human_papilloma_virus , which is difficult to treat and can become chronic , is not a disease that must be reported in the United States , and the federal_government has no program to deal with it . Health officials in some states have only recently been asked to report chlamydia cases , but there are few programs to control the disease . &quot; We have a large_number of youths who are sexually active , and we still have a large percentage of youths who are not using condoms . I don ' t see this problem as diminishing significantly , &quot; Hofmann says . One in five adult Americans carries some type of viral STD , such_as herpes , which are not curable , according to the Guttmacher report . When the curable , bacterial STDs -- such_as syphilis , gonorrhea and chlamydia -- are included , Americans have at least a one in four lifetime chance of contracting an STD . But the price of sexual freedom is more profound for 15- to 19-year-olds than for their parents because of the widening pool of infections in that age_group . About one in five reported AIDS cases is diagnosed among people in their 20s . But since the virus has a long incubation_period -- about 10 years -- most were adolescents when they were infected , according to the CDC . That fact is particularly alarming because many STDs act in synergy with HIV to enhance the transmission of both , experts say . Having an STD , such_as gonorrhea , increases by as much as 100 times the chance of contracting HIV from an infected partner , according to some estimates . &quot; As time goes_on , we ' re seeing more and more of a connection between HIV and syphilis and gonorrhea , &quot; says Sylvia Drew Ivie , director of T.H.E. Clinic , in Los Angeles , which treats underserved families and has a large teen-age clientele . &quot; I think the fact that ( syphilis and gonorrhea rates ) are high is not only alarming by itself but by their connection to hidden HIV infection . One of the indicators of HIV are these other diseases. &quot; Although HIV has helped raise awareness about all STDs , there is a common misperception that , other_than HIV , the diseases are easily cured and cause no lasting harm . That is not true , Donovan says . As infections slink through the population they lay a minefield of future reproductive problems , such_as infertility , ectopic_pregnancy and miscarriage . &quot; I don ' t think people understand how common some of these serious consequences are , particularly infertility , &quot; Donovan says . &quot; That has a major impact on the lives of millions of women who would like to have children. &quot; In addition , STDs often attack women silently , without symptoms . But this crucial bit of information rarely reaches young people . For example , one 1990 study of college_students in Canada found almost half didn ' t know STDs can be asymptomatic . &quot; Seventy-five per cent of women with chlamydia don ' t have any symptoms , &quot; Donovan says . &quot; They don ' t know until five years later , when they have serious pelvic pain , or 10 years later , when they can ' t get pregnant , that they had this STD that would have been easily curable. &quot; Teen-agers are sexually active younger and have more partners than did previous generations . According to a new national poll of more_than 11 # 000 high school-aged youths , 54 % said they were sexually active , compared to 29 % in 1970 . The portion of 15-year-olds having_sex has risen from 4.6 % in 1970 to 26 % . Almost one-fifth of the sexually active teens say they have had four or more partners . In addition to being less likely to use condoms , young people are more likely to use drugs and alcohol , which often leads to unwise decisions about sex . In the national study , published in July ' s American Journal of Public Health , over half of the sexually active teens said that they had not used a condom when they last had_intercourse . Among students who used illicit drugs , one-third said that they had multiple partners and did not use condoms when they last had_sex . &quot; Sexual behavior is putting a sizable portion of high_school students at risk , &quot; says Dr. Richard Lowry , a CDC adolescent health expert and lead author of the report . Having several partners is especially dangerous for teen-age girls because , studies show , they often have an immature cervix which may be more easily infected . But the biggest problem among young people -- male or female -- may be that they don ' t perceive themselves at risk for STDs -- until it happens , experts say . Widespread efforts to promote safe_sex because of the HIV threat have helped reach some , but far from all , young people . &quot; We ' ve used HIV as the ' great bad outcome ' to encourage people to undertake precautions , &quot; says Dr. Stuart Berman , of the CDC ' s Division of STD / HIV Prevention . Armando , now 20 , started having_sex years ago but didn ' t bother to use condoms . Then his aunt died of AIDS . &quot; That changed me , &quot; he says , sitting in a clinic where he works part-time as a peer counselor to youths seeking treatment for an STD . &quot; I used to think if a girl looks clean she was probably clean . I didn ' t know there were so many diseases. &quot; Armando himself was treated for an STD and says he now always uses condoms . But although the HIV threat may be convincing some high_school and college_students to practice safe_sex , says UCI ' s Hofmann , &quot; There is no evidence that the HIV threat or anything else has affected the behavior of the alienated youth population , such_as the kids who drop_out of school. &quot; And the HIV threat message may miss some adolescents who simply don ' t think_about sex or its repercussions until it ' s too late . When adolescents were asked_in one study why they do not use protection , 65 % said it was because sex was unexpected . Youths may avoid using condoms because it indicates they &quot; planned &quot; to have_sex , Hofmann says . Few people , adult or adolescent , understand that having_sex with one person may mean being exposed to the diseases of many others , says Laura Brannon , an Ohio State University researcher who has studied what she calls &quot; the phantom sex partner. &quot; This fact may be especially true for teen-agers , among whom STD rates are extremely high and condom use low . For example , one study in Atlanta found that 24 % of teen-aged women with only one sexual partner had chlamydia . Tricia , a 20-year-old from the Westside , learned that lesson the hard way . She recently contracted gonorrhea from her longtime boyfriend after he returned from a six-month military tour . &quot; It was so upsetting because I had always used protection when I was dating other people , &quot; Tricia says . &quot; This was the one person that , for three years , I had never questioned . When you get something from someone you care about , just think what you could get from strangers who will tell you anything. &quot; Condoms are very effective in preventing disease if used correctly every time , Donovan says . &quot; But just giving people condoms is not enough . You have to educate people on their risks . I think one of the real shortcomings ( of the nation ' s attempt to control STDs ) is the refusal of television networks to air condom ads. &quot; Many sex educators criticize what they say is a deadly double_standard : Sex education for children and teen-agers is restrained at_the_same_time that young people are bombarded by sexuality on TV and in movies and song lyrics . Guilt , shame and fear that their parents will discover their sexual_activity prevents many adolescents from seeking health_care when they do suspect they have an STD , Hofmann says . In California , children 12 and older can seek STD treatment on_their_own . But , she says : &quot; These kids still don ' t know where to go. &quot; Few school-based health clinics offer such services , experts say . As for government-sponsored STD clinics , many are clearly marked units in urban health departments where adults line_up for appointments early in the morning and wait for hours , noted one expert , who added : &quot; Teen-agers would n ' t be caught dead there. &quot; And it would take a gutsy child to raise the issue of sex with a pediatrician or the family_doctor . In one report on college freshmen published in the journal Pediatrics , 79 % said they had never been counseled about STDs by a physician . Only one-third of sexually active females ages 15 to 19 are screened for an STD each year , according to another study . &quot; Either the doctors themselves have no idea of the prevalence of STDs or they don ' t want to offend their patients by suggesting they may have one of these diseases , &quot; Donovan says . That is beginning to change . The American Medical Assn . in 1992 issued a report on adolescent health advising doctors to regularly counsel their teen patients about responsible sexual behavior and to make condoms and contraceptives available . The report also called_for routine STD screening for sexually active youths . To prevent STDs in young people , experts say , more sex education has to occur in doctors ' offices , family_planning clinics , health centers , schools and homes . &quot; We educate our young children early not to get_in a car with a stranger . I don ' t see how we cannot educate our kids in_regard_to sexual decision-making , &quot; Hofmann says . &quot; Sure , it would be a lot easier if kids weren ' t sexually active , but that ain ' t the fact . If we are going_to have a permissive society , we have to equip our kids for it . We can ' t just say , ' Just say no. ' &quot; The Teen Factor About 55 % of U.S. adolescents are sexually active . Members of this group have higher rates of sexually transmitted disease than any other age_group , according to health experts . Here are the percentages of sexually active teen-agers infected with : 03 # 23 , 05 # 07 Men Women Gonorrhea 6 % 10 % Chiamydia 10 % 22 % Trichomoniasis * - 21 % Human_papilloma_virus 15 % 39 % * Does not usually appear in men Note : These averages represent ranges of infection as reported by several studies . Terms to Know Gonorrhea and syphilis have been around for ages , but several other sexually transmitted diseases have been identified only in the past two decades . Chlamydia : Bacterial . Often produces no symptoms in women . Men may experience discharge and burning sensation . Curable . Genital Herpes : Viral . Symptoms are often mild but can include itching or burning sensation and pain in legs or genital area . Blisters or painful sores may appear and recur any time . Incurable , but a drug is available to reduce symptoms . Gonorrhea : Bacterial . Symptoms often absent but can include discharge , burning sensation and itching . Curable . Hepatitis_B : Viral . No symptoms present in one-third of all cases but can cause fever , headache , muscle ache , vomiting and diarrhea . Infections often clear_up themselves , but some people become chronically infected . A vaccine is available to prevent infection . HIV : Viral . Often asymptomatic for many years . Later symptoms include immune_system deterioration . Symptoms can be treated but infection is otherwise incurable . Human_Papilloma_Virus : Viral . Produces painless fleshy warts . Warts can be removed but infection often reappears . Syphilis : Bacterial . Produces painless sores in early stages . Curable . Trichomoniasis : Parasitic infection . Women may have vaginal discharge and odor . Curable . Sources : Dr. Adele D . Hofmann ; U.S. Office of Technology Assessment , &quot; Adolescent Health , Vol .
