   <HEADLINE> RENO TO PROTEST MEXICO ' S PLAN TO WITHHOLD SUSPECT IN RAPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atty . Gen . Janet Reno and other U.S. officials plan to protest the Mexican government ' s refusal to extradite a suspect in the brutal rape of a 4-year-old Riverside County girl when they meet with the Mexican Cabinet here today , officials said Sunday . Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari personally promised to secure the extradition of Serapio Zuniga Rios last year , when the issue was a point of contention in the congressional debate over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . But late last month , the Mexican government notified the U.S. Embassy here that Zuniga had been tried in secret and convicted -- meaning he would not be extradited after all . Both Reno and State_Department officials had planned to protest the Mexican action strongly during their meetings here , aides said . Reno arrived in Mexico_City Sunday night along with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and other top Clinton_Administration officials for a two-day mission , one of a series of regular meetings between the two governments . &quot; We are deeply shocked and disappointed by the Mexican government ' s actions , &quot; said Robert S . Gelbard , assistant secretary_of_state for narcotics and international crime issues . &quot; The Mexican government has known from the beginning that we have considered the Zuniga Rios case to be of fundamental importance , &quot; he said . &quot; We thought we had complete assurances from the Mexican government . . . that this man would be extradited . . . . If they are not prepared to extradite Zuniga Rios under the assurances we have gotten , under what circumstances are they going_to extradite anyone ? &quot; A senior State_Department official , speaking anonymously , was blunter . &quot; They lied to us , &quot; he said . &quot; There was amazement , horror and real anger when we learned what they had done. &quot; Zuniga , a 28-year-old Mexican national , was sentenced April 27 after he was convicted of sexual_assault , abduction and burglary in the kidnaping of the girl from a ranch near Temecula in September , 1992 . After assaulting the girl , Zuniga wrapped her in a blanket and hanged the bundle from a tree , according to police . Zuniga was allegedly enraged because he had been fired from a job at the ranch , which is owned by the girl ' s parents . Zuniga later fled to Mexico , where he was arrested last December after an extensive manhunt . The issue of extradition has been a sore point in U.S.-Mexican relations . Mexico has never extradited one of its citizens wanted for crimes in the United States , citing concerns of national sovereignty . In 1990 , U.S. agents abducted a Mexican wanted for participation in the murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena because the George_Bush Administration did not believe Mexico would extradite him . Since then , the two countries have drafted a &quot; non-abduction treaty &quot; to prevent similar incidents . But U.S. officials said they negotiated the treaty on the understanding that Mexico had changed its extradition policy , and said President Clinton is unlikely to sign the pact unless the policy is changed .</TEXT>
