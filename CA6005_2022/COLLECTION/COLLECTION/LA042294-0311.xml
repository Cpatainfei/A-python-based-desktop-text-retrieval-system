   <TEXT> What to look_for in some key PC components : * Central_processing_unit . It contains the microprocessor , the &quot; brains &quot; of the computer . IBM-compatibles operate_on the 8086-80486 family of microprocessor chips ( 386 , 486 , for short ) or the new Pentium chip by Intel . Chips ' processing speeds are expressed in megahertz . The higher the number , the faster the computer ' s response to instructions . Experts ' recommendations : nothing less than a 386 , since older machines cannot run many of today ' s newest programs , with a minimum of 25 megahertz . Also , look_for a &quot; DX &quot; processor rather than an &quot; SX &quot; to run mathematical spreadsheets . * Random access memory , or RAM . This is where the computer_stores programs and files_in use . Storage capacity is expressed in megabytes , with one megabyte able to store a_million characters . Most systems , though , can have memory added through single in-line memory modules , or SIMMs , that plug into a computer . The more memory , the more data can be used at one time and the faster a computer works . Recommendation : nothing lower than four megabytes , especially for those planning to use Windows software . * Hard disk_drive . It stores all software programs and data even when the PC is turned_off , like a computer data warehouse . Recommendation : a minimum of 105 megabytes , though the average for most models today is in the 200-megabyte range . * Floppy_disk drive . This allows PC users to read or save data from other computer sources stored on floppy_disks . Recommendations : It would be ideal to have two floppy_disk drives -- one for 5 1 / 4-inch floppies and one for 3 1 / 2-inch floppies . But if you have to choose just one , pick the one for the smaller floppies , since they have become the industry standard . * Monitor . It houses the screen on which information is displayed . Recommendations : a minimum 14-inch screen , though larger screens are better for spreadsheet programs . A &quot; super VGA &quot; and non-interlaced screen is best for the eyes . * Keyboard and mouse . Both are used to give commands to the computer . Recommendation : whatever feels comfortable . * Modem . This allows computer data to be carried_over phone_lines and is necessary for connection to on-line information services such_as Prodigy or CompuServe . Many modems also have faxing capabilities . The faster the modem , the less time it takes_to transmit data and the lower your phone_bill . Recommendation : a minimum 2 # 400-baud modem , though many experts say it is wiser_to invest in faster 9 # 600- and 14 # 400-baud modems . * Printer . It transfers computer-generated text and pictures to paper . The least expensive is the dot-matrix , which creates characters by printing a series of dots . A laser_printer , which uses a laser_beam to transfer images , is the most expensive but offers the highest_quality . Recommendation : If you need letter-quality results , stick_with a laser_printer .</TEXT>
