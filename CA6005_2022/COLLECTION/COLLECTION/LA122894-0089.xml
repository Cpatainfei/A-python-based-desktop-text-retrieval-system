   <TEXT> Van Nuys Democrat David Roberti and Glendale Republican Pat Nolan began 1994 as members of the state ' s political elite . Now , Roberti is holding_down a job as an appointee to an obscure state panel and Nolan is in state_prison . * Meanwhile , 1994 saw San Fernando Valley voters help elect the state Legislature ' s first openly gay member to a local Assembly seat , give Zev Yaroslavsky a long-delayed political promotion and defy the GOP juggernaut to hand Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) a 10th term in Congress . The year also witnessed a political awakening among Latino students , many of whom took_to the streets prior to the November statewide election to protest Proposition 187 , the measure to bar illegal immigrants from benefiting from a wide range of government services . In short , 1994 was a big year for politics in the Valley . The year began with a bombshell when it was revealed that a ragtag band of dissidents had gathered enough signatures to force Roberti , then president pro_tempore of the state Senate and one of the state ' s most powerful elected officials , into a history-making recall election . It was the first time in decades that a recall challenge against a California state legislator had qualified for the ballot . This political feat was fueled largely by money and volunteers from gun-rights groups incensed by Roberti ' s support for gun_control laws , including a 1989 ban on assault weapons . With the help of gun-control advocates nationwide , including the family of James Brady , the former White_House press secretary badly injured in the 1981 assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan , Roberti eventually defeated his recall challengers -- who even raffled_off a collection of guns to finance their campaign . But the victory was costly . The exhausting April recall election has been largely blamed for Roberti ' s defeat in June for the Democratic nomination for state_treasurer . Although term limits prevented Roberti from seeking reelection to his 20th District seat , the Sacramento old-boy network came_to the veteran legislator ' s aid . On Dec . 7 -- two days after he left_office -- Roberti ' s former Senate colleagues announced they had appointed him to four-year post on the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals_Board at a salary of $ 97 # 000 a year . Nineteen Ninety-Four was also a topsy-turvy year for Nolan . In February , Nolan , the former GOP minority_leader in the Assembly , stunned his supporters by pleading guilty to one count of political corruption and resigning . Within days , Nolan was sent_packing to state_prison to serve a 33-month sentence . The political passing of Roberti and Nolan triggered succession fights . The winners here were veteran state Sen . Herschel Rosenthal , 76 , who dropped his retirement_plans to run_for -- and easily win -- Roberti ' s seat , and former Municipal Judge James E . Rogan . Rogan , a former Democrat who by 1994 had become a right-wing Republican supportive of school prayer and teaching creationism in public_schools , was elected twice to Nolan ' s seat in 1994 -- first in a May special election to fill_out the remainder of Nolan ' s term and then again in November , when he won a regular two-year term in the Assembly . Rogan ' s twin victories embarrassed Democrats , who had entertained hopes that 1994 would be their year to crack the GOP ' s grip on the 43rd Assembly District . Meanwhile , on the other side of the Valley , it was the Republican_Party that was getting its comeuppance . Nineteen Ninety-Four was the year the GOP expected to oust incumbent Beilenson from his 24th Congressional District seat that included the western San Fernando Valley , Malibu and the Conejo Valley . Former Wilson Administration aide Rich Sybert , the GOP hopeful in the race , appeared to have the horsepower needed to defeat Beilenson , including a large and heavily self-financed war_chest and the support of the GOP ' s national leadership , including Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) and U . S . Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) . But Beilenson won reelection by a razor-thin margin after portraying Sybert as a creature of special_interests , while holding himself up as an independent who refused to take campaign contributions from political_action_committees , as he has for years . Beilenson ' s victory was especially surprising because the Democrat was a rare survivor in national elections that saw Republicans seize control of both houses of Congress . The 1994 political season also witnessed several other highlights . One of these was the election of Sheila Kuehl , a lesbian attorney who played the role of Zelda in the TV sitcom &quot; The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis , &quot; to the 41st Assembly District seat , succeeding the retiring Terry Friedman . Kuehl , who took_office this month , is the first openly homosexual member of the California Legislature . In June , Los Angeles City Councilman Yaroslavsky , who for years had found his plans for political advancement stymied , got a break when County Supervisor Ed Edelman retired , giving Yaroslavsky an unobstructed shot at promotion . Yaroslavsky ' s ascension to the Board of Supervisors has triggered a pell-mell race for his council seat , in which his wife , Barbara , could be found among the contestants in the April primary . Also competing in this spirited contest are Michael Feuer , the former head of a Jewish legal aid group , and former Los Angeles school_board member Roberta Weintraub . By year ' s end , the Los Angeles City_Council had nixed a plan -- advanced by a coalition of neighborhood and business groups -- to appoint an interim council_member to fill Yaroslavsky ' s 5th District seat until a successor was elected . The defeat of this proposal means the 5th District council duties will be handled by an obscure City_Hall bureaucrat , Avak Keotahian , who has no power to vote on the City_Council and must make_do with a skeleton staff , for at least the next several months .</TEXT>
