   <HEADLINE> QUAKE AID REQUESTS NEAR HALF-MILLION MARK ; RELIEF : DESPITE RECORD FIGURES , FUNDS WON ' T RUN_OUT , OFFICIALS SAY . THE MAY 17 DEADLINE MAY BE EXTENDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Requests for government assistance stemming from the Northridge earthquake -- already at an all-time high for a U.S. disaster -- are expected to top 500 # 000 by Monday , as applications pour in from a wide swath of the region . As of Friday , government_agencies had received 497 # 626 requests for assistance , and approved more_than $ 1.4 billion in aid to businesses and individuals . Earthquake victims have received checks for everything from emergency housing to replacing lost dentures . The number of requests -- shattering the record of 304 # 000 from Hurricane Hugo -- is larger than the population of some major cities , such_as New Orleans and Denver . &quot; We have as of this point 148 # 000 applications , &quot; said Bernard Kulik , assistant administrator for disaster assistance for the U.S. Small Business Administration . &quot; that ' s a lot , almost as_many as we had in Hurricane Andrew , the Midwest floods , Loma Prieta and Hurricane Hugo -- combined. &quot; Officials say they are in no danger of exhausting a federal allocation of $ 9.8 billion in earthquake relief -- even with an expected $ 2.6 billion in requests from local and state_governments for their emergency response costs and repairs_to public facilities . Records and interviews show the vast scope of the relief effort : * The Federal Emergency Management Agency has assisted 237 # 000 people , including 149 # 000 homeowners who needed repairs_to make their dwellings &quot; safe , secure and sanitary. &quot; The agency also paid rent for 88 # 000 renters and homeowners whose residences were rendered uninhabitable . * Of the 148 # 000 applications received by the Small Business Administration for home , personal and business loans , 25 # 000 have been approved . * The state_Department of Social_Services paid an average of $ 1 # 058 to 13 # 000 earthquake victims who were unable to draw_on any other resource -- public or private -- to pay_for basic necessities . Funds were provided to allow earthquake victims to replace lost appliances , clothing and , in one case , a $ 10 # 000 electric wheelchair . * The federal_Department of Housing and Urban Development has approved approximately 20 # 000 rent subsidies for low-income quake victims . Applications came from every corner of Los Angeles County , from Azusa and Long_Beach , from Palmdale to Pacific Palisades , according to the state emergency officials . The vast majority were from Los Angeles , including more_than 30 # 000 from Northridge , 23 # 000 from Van Nuys and 20 # 000 from Canoga Park , 10 # 000 from Santa Monica and 4 # 200 from Hollywood . In Ventura County , more_than 18 # 000 applications came from Simi Valley . The application deadline for most programs is May 17 , but officials said it could be extended if the demand warrants . The total number of applications exceeds 500 # 000 , because some individuals have applied for more_than one form of aid . &quot; The thing that surprises us the most is that over two months after the earthquake , we ' re still seeing such a large_number of people still coming_in requesting assistance , &quot; said Richard Andrews , director of the state Office of Emergency Services . But Andrews said there are no indications that fraud or other abuses are inflating the number of applications . * Although the number of applications continues to rise , officials said the proportion of new applicants whose damage does not qualify for aid appears to be increasing . The main reason is that they suffered insufficient damage . &quot; As checks go_out to people , they tell their buddies and they say , ' Hey , I ' m going_to call and apply too , ' &quot; said Peter Wessell , one of about 500 field inspectors working seven days a week to survey damage claimed by applicants . He said that one day last week , he failed to find a single applicant who he thought qualified for aid . About 80 % of the applications completed by early this week had been judged eligible for some aid , but one official said that percentage could dip as low as 70 % by the time agencies stop taking new requests . Some late applicants have discovered more damage after they began tearing_down walls or exposing foundations to make repairs . Some were property_owners who suffered new damage in the strong aftershocks . Carlos Gonzalez , 41 , a San Fernando homeowner , applied for aid last week only after a longtime friend who is a FEMA employee said he might be eligible . With cracked walls and floor damage in his home , Gonzalez said he tried making the repairs himself . But he said last month ' s magnitude 5.3 aftershock worsened the damage and the roof began leaking during the recent rainstorms . Gonzalez said he did not apply earlier because he had assumed that most federal relief was available only through loans . &quot; I didn ' t want more debts , &quot; he said . But in fact , he may be eligible for a FEMA cash grant for home repairs . Like Gonzalez , Jeannie Russell and Artie Parti of Van Nuys only recently applied for aid . Initially they thought the damage to their townhouse was relatively minor compared to the buildings that had collapsed in other parts of the San Fernando Valley . Then the bills began adding_up . One estimate put the cost of filling cracks and repainting at $ 9 # 500 , with other repairs_to cost thousands more . Although they had insurance , Russell , a chiropractor , and Parti , a children ' s party entertainer , still would be out at least $ 3 # 400 . &quot; There ' s a cap on what we can get from the insurance so we decided we needed a little bit more help , &quot; Parti said . But Wessell , the FEMA inspector who visited their townhouse , said he found that the damage was not enough to qualify them for aid . &quot; If it ' s mostly . . . cosmetic cracks throughout and that is all it is , that is not a hazard , &quot; he said . One reason so many applications have been filed is that relief agencies have aggressively spread the word about the types of aid available . &quot; We ' re still finding pockets of people &quot; who suffered losses and did not apply , for various reasons , said Fausto Recalde , an outreach worker serving central and southern Los Angeles . Yelena Lerner , a Russian-speaking federal relief worker , found that little attention had been paid to the city ' s Russian immigrants , many of them elderly and living_in the West Hollywood area . So she prepared a Russian-language flyer . Among those drawn to FEMA centers by the handwritten flyer was 64-year-old Maria Lebedeva , who lost appliances , housewares and a television in the earthquake but did not know where to turn . &quot; We got ( the flyer ) from a friend , &quot; she said through an interpreter , after applying for a cash grant . &quot; Before , we didn ' t know. &quot; Some people have been frustrated by the aid process . Joan Lampner , a hygienist whose Bel-Air condominium was declared unlivable , said she had to make repeated calls and visits to relief agencies trying to get a FEMA inspector to her home . &quot; They ' d say , ' we ' ll put a tracer on it , ' &quot; she said . &quot; I must have had them put a tracer on it every day. &quot; Nearly two months after applying for aid , and getting a relief supervisor to track her file down , Lampner finally met with an inspector at her condo and a_few days later received her first $ 3 # 400 check for property repairs . With mortgage payments coming due , she is still waiting for a FEMA temporary housing grant . &quot; Everybody ' s very caring here , &quot; she said last week at a FEMA center . &quot; It ' s just very difficult. &quot; Officials acknowledge that there have been delays , glitches and some bottlenecks , notably problems with the software in a high-tech system of hand-held_computers used in the field to file inspection reports verifying damage . But Frank Kishton , the federal coordinating officer for the relief effort in Los Angeles , said the overall response and distribution of aid has been quicker than after other disasters . On average , it has taken FEMA about three weeks to process a request and provide a check to an applicant for housing assistance , officials said . It has taken the Small Business Administration four to six weeks to approve loans to homeowners and businesses , although it can take longer to receive a check . Officials said they are not finding much fraud . There have been only five arrests so far . Four people are accused of fraudulently obtaining money by claiming to have lived_in the Northridge Meadows apartment_building , which collapsed , killing 16 . One person was arrested on charges of submitting a fraudulent SBA application for $ 1.5 million . However , Assistant U.S. Atty . Nathan J . Hochman said more arrests and prosecutions will come soon . People who obtained money improperly can probably avoid trouble by returning the checks , Hochman said . &quot; We ' re trying to encourage people to give the money back before we have to go_out and get_it , &quot; he added . FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said some fraud occurs in every disaster and that the agency tries , through computer checks and inspectors ' visits , to pursue those who improperly obtained money . But he said , &quot; By policy , we are in the business of providing assistance . . . not arresting people . If . . . it was an honest mistake , we don ' t prosecute. &quot; Times staff writer Richard Lee Colvin contributed to this article . * LITTLE HELP : SBA loans have been slow in coming . D1 .
