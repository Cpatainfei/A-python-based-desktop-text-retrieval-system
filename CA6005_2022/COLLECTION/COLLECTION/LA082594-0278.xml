   <HEADLINE> 22 POUNDS OF URANIUM RECOVERED BY RUSSIANS ; REGULATION : MATERIAL STOLEN FROM A CLOSED NUCLEAR CENTER IS REPORTEDLY NOT WEAPONS-GRADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian security officials , adding weight to promises that they would work harder to stop nuclear smuggling , announced Wednesday that they recovered more_than 22 pounds of uranium stolen from a closed nuclear center . The uranium-238 is not weapons-grade and Atomic Energy Ministry spokesman Georgy Kaurov said the material is so harmless it could best be used as a weight for a fishing lure or &quot; to make presses for buckets of sauerkraut. &quot; But in the wake of German accusations that plutonium recently seized in the Munich airport originated_in Russia , the uranium case served as concrete reassurance that Moscow would try harder to keep its nuclear stocks under_control . The origin of the Munich plutonium has not definitely been established , but German suspicions that it came from Russia -- it arrived on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow -- were so strong that Chancellor Helmut Kohl dispatched his intelligence coordinator for three days of talks with Russian security chiefs . The meetings yielded joint_resolutions Monday to fight the nuclear black_market harder and with more coordination but no definitive word on where the plutonium came from . Western governments harbor intense fears that the general disarray and corruption in the former Soviet_Union will lead to a swelling supply of black-market nuclear materials that could ultimately be used by terrorists or a hostile dictatorship to hold the world hostage . It is unclear whether there is a market for purloined uranium and plutonium . But the latest Russian theft , solved by police in the closed nuclear city called Arzamas-16 , demonstrated that the supply of the radioactive materials , or at least the will to provide them , is abundant . &quot; I think these fools who stole the uranium in Arzamas-16 simply fell_for the turmoil in the press , &quot; Kaurov said . &quot; They thought they could sell it for millions of dollars and make a fortune out of it . They didn ' t know what they were doing. &quot; Despite some Western aid , the nuclear industry in Russia remains a hungry one . At the Kurchatov Institute , one of Russia ' s premier nuclear centers , scientists earn a mere $ 100 a month and atomic_power plant workers have repeatedly threatened to strike because their salaries were delayed for months . Police have noted a tendency by workers to steal almost anything radioactive in the belief that it will find a buyer on the black_market . The kind of press encouragement Kaurov referred to can be found in newspapers like the daily Vechernaya Moskva , which told readers a rise in nuclear thefts was inevitable in coming months because Russia ' s economy is so bad and the materials are so valuable . It quoted Sergei Novikov , one of the top officials in Russia ' s nuclear inspection agency , who told Radio Liberty that , at a factory near the Estonian border , at least 22 nuclear fuel units had been stolen in the course of a year and sold to Estonian factories . &quot; What do you want , when you can get such materials in Russia for a bottle ( of vodka ) and sell them in Estonia for a_few thousand dollars ? &quot; he reportedly asked . The uranium-238 stolen in Arzamas-16 was found Sunday , the Federal Counterintelligence Service reported Wednesday . It said the uranium was good only for industrial use , not for bomb-building , and would normally cost about $ 50 a pound if bought officially . The uranium had been reported missing earlier in Arzamas-16 -- a high-security center of nuclear science , much like Los Alamos in New Mexico -- and police arrested two unemployed men on suspicion of stealing the material . Meantime , on Wednesday , Pakistan sought to defuse its latest nuclear controversy , caused by a former Pakistani prime_minister who claimed his country possesses the atomic_bomb . Nawaz Sharif , the former prime_minister who now heads the main opposition party , said Tuesday in a speech at Neela Butt , part of the disputed Kashmir territory controlled by Pakistan , that &quot; I confirm that Pakistan possesses the atomic bomb. &quot; He insisted that Pakistan did not have the bomb when he served as its leader . But Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali on Wednesday repeated Pakistan ' s longstanding position that it has the components and the know-how to make atomic_bombs but has not done so . &quot; I want to say categorically that Pakistan does not have nuclear_weapons and does not intend to make nuclear_weapons , &quot; Ali said in an interview on state television .</TEXT>
