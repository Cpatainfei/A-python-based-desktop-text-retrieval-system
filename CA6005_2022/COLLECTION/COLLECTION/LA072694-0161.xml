   <HEADLINE> THOUSANDS OF RWANDANS RETURN TO WAR-TORN LAND ; AFRICA : REFUGEES LEAVE FETID CAMPS DESPITE THREATS OF VIOLENCE IN HOMELAND . CHOLERA EPIDEMIC HAS KILLED 14 # 000 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The barefoot old_woman hobbled quickly here Monday , her worn bamboo cane pounding the pavement as fast as she could walk . Deep inside her native_land , Generose Nyirandoti was headed_home from the horrors of a cholera-ridden refugee camp in Zaire . She balanced a rolled sleeping mat on her grizzled gray head . She guarded her identification papers in a dirty plastic bag hidden inside her tattered wrap . And her gnarled hand held tightly to her most precious possession -- a 4-year-old granddaughter in a torn , filthy sweat shirt . She was the only survivor in her family . &quot; Her father is dead , &quot; Nyirandoti said , as the tiny girl tore ravenously into a roll offered by a reporter . &quot; Her mother is dead . Even her brothers and sisters are dead . We will die too if we stay there. &quot; A day after Zairian officials agreed to open the sealed border after repeated urgent appeals by the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , thousands of Rwandans trudged steadily along the narrow winding road Monday , heading_home into an eerily deserted land that was once Africa ' s most densely populated country . A daylong drive about 30 miles into western Rwanda found looted ghost_towns and villages perched on beautifully terraced mountains and nestled in lush valleys lined with dense groves of eucalyptus and bamboo . Endless green fields appeared at every turn , bursting with a bounty of corn , beans and bananas . But except for the odd military truck , the long line of refugees was the only sign of humanity . They walked alone , in pairs , and in groups of 10 and 20 , with meager possessions on their heads and infants safely bundled on their backs . Other_than the shuffling of feet , the only sound was the cawing of crows and the rustle of the mountain breeze . Two barefoot men carried another in a stretcher atop their heads , and he shaded himself with a ripped golf umbrella . Another hauled a gaunt woman in a rusty wheelbarrow . About half_a_dozen people had collapsed , however , and their forlorn corpses lay_in the dust . The residents here were butchered in massacres that began in April , when the Hutu government ' s civilian militias and death squads launched a genocidal pogrom of the minority Tutsi population . An estimated 500 # 000 Tutsis were slaughtered , most hacked to death with machetes . But when the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front army quickly routed the Hutu government , the fleeing 40 # 000-member military_forced virtually the entire Hutu population here to cross the border with them into neighboring Zaire . An estimated 1.2 million Hutu refugees now live_in miserable camps set_on a moonscape of sharp volcanic_rocks . A still-worsening cholera epidemic has killed up_to 14 # 000 people , doctors say , and dire shortages of food , water and medicine leave tens of thousands more at risk . Members of the murderous militias now control parts of the disease-ridden camps ; many of their leaders are reluctantly used by relief groups to help distribute what little food is available . Hutu leaders have ordered the refugees not to leave , warning that they will be killed if they return . But a growing stream of Rwandans have decided to take the risk . &quot; In Zaire , they told us they ( the victorious rebel soldiers ) are killing people , but it is false , &quot; said Ferdinand Niyatusenga , 29 , who headed_home in lace-less shoes that flapped along the road . His barefoot friend , Jean Wemeyirongo , 34 , agreed : &quot; It ' s better to come_back , even if they kill me. &quot; Most of the 50 friends and family members who fled the capital , Kigali , with them for Zaire are now dead , he said . But the refugees said the victorious RPF soldiers had welcomed them back , giving food at check-points and truck rides to a_few of the worst-off . &quot; I am asking people along the road if we can go_on , and people say we have nothing to fear , &quot; Wemeyirongo added . Ray Wilkinson , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , said about 1 # 000 refugees crossed the border into Rwanda at Goma , Zaire , on Monday and several thousand others had headed_home through nearby forests . &quot; It ' s going slowly , but it ' s going , &quot; he said . An official from the agency was posted at the border to monitor the refugees , and about 15 blue-helmeted U.N. troops will be assigned there today . The refugees were not asked_for documents as they crossed into the former lakeside resort of Gisenyi . Once home to Rwanda ' s president and several ministers , its elegant villas are empty , and the broad palm-lined streets are filled with burned-out vehicles and other debris of war . &quot; Refugees don ' t have papers , &quot; said Lt . Peter Karake , 39 , the RPF commander at the border . He added that like many Tutsis , he had grown_up as a refugee in Uganda and Kenya . &quot; Personally , I don ' t have papers either. &quot; The new government has compiled a list of alleged Hutu war_criminals , and Karake said they will be tried when they are caught . But he said there was no urgency . &quot; To hunt people involved in genocide is not overnight , &quot; he said . &quot; The Nazis are still_hunted after half a century . So we are in no hurry. &quot; The border at Goma is still lined with stacks of grenades , assault_rifles , ammunition belts , machetes and spears -- all confiscated from Rwandans when they began crossing into Zaire in an unprecedented exodus about 10 days ago . Dan Everts , head of the World Food Program operation on the border , said the agency hopes to begin truck convoys across Rwanda within days to bring food faster to the refugees . He said the returning , empty trucks could then be used to carry the old , sick and children home . Maj . Gen . Romeo Dallaire , head of U.N. forces in Rwanda , told reporters at the border that fighting had ceased inside Rwanda and the situation was &quot; relatively calm. &quot; He urged people to return to help rebuild their shattered land . Virtually all_the refugees headed_home said they had lost family members in the maelstrom of confusion and death at the border . Walking alone , Bridgette Uwera , 16 , cried as she recalled losing her father when she went_to fetch water at one of the sprawling camps . &quot; When I came_back , he wasn ' t there , &quot; she said , tears streaming down her face . She doesn ' t know if he , or her two brothers , their wives and children , are alive or dead . &quot; I ' m going_home because if I go_home , maybe I will find them , &quot; she said . She said other refugees had given her potatoes and cassava to eat , her first meal in days . Down the road , Moise Ngorati sat on the ground with three children , sharing millet and potatoes given to them by RPF soldiers . The girls were 8 and 11 ; their brother was 10 . Dressed in filthy , cast-off clothes , they stared reverently at Ngorati as he spoke . &quot; I met them in Goma , &quot; he explained . &quot; They were alone and had nothing to eat . I had some sugar and shared it with them . So now we are all together. &quot; He said he would take them to Ruhengeri , a provincial town nearby , then continue home to Kigali , hoping to find his own family . &quot; I ' m not expecting to find them alive , &quot; he added . Indeed , hope was hard to find among the survivors . Cleopace Mugabo , a barefoot , 38-year-old farmer from Karago , simply shrugged when asked his plans . &quot; If I must die , I prefer to die in my own country , &quot; he said without emotion . He reached up_to readjust the bulky sack on his head , patted the boy on his back and marched_on , silently headed_home .</TEXT>
