   <HEADLINE> A REFUGE NO MORE ; LIKE THE WORLD AROUND IT , THE WORKPLACE IS BECOMING A MORE VIOLENT PLACE , EXPERTS SAY . BUT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES NEED NOT FEEL HELPLESS . THERE ARE WAYS TO BOOST SAFETY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What was so shocking about the incident was that it happened in the workplace . A post_office , of all places . An enraged part-time mail_carrier named Patrick Sherrill walked into the Edmond , Okla. , post_office Aug . 20 , 1986 , and killed 14 co-workers before shooting himself to death . The incident marked the onset of a terrifying phenomenon in America . In the eight years since Edmond , workplace violence has become the most urgent occupational health-and-safety issue of the era , many health experts say . Since 1989 , the number of homicides occurring at_work has tripled , according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , with 1 # 063 people murdered on_the_job last year . One recent survey found that 18 % of workers said they had been assaulted in the workplace . There is even a slang term for the phenomenon -- &quot; going postal. &quot; Now , following_up_on requests from the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention and OSHA , mental_health experts are churning_out a wealth of studies designed to identify the behavioral and emotional triggers and what to do about them . So far , the studies indicate that the tactics taken most often by employers -- doing nothing or simply hiring extra security personnel -- are inadequate . Instead , companies should do careful pre-hiring screening , train employees on how to spot and report threatening behavior , enact policies to deal with disgruntled or threatening workers and try to improve stressful work environments as well as beefing_up security . Moreover , studies show the reasons people go berserk at_work -- killing , assaulting , harassing , raping or robbing their co-workers , supervisors or subordinates -- are much more complex than initially believed , says Michael R . Mantell , a San Diego psychologist and leading expert in the field . &quot; Steps need to be taken_to prevent the increase of violence in the workplace , and one of the best deterrents is to not hire violence-prone individuals in the first place , &quot; Mantell says . &quot; Asking the right questions , knowing what profile to look_for , and thorough background checks should prevent an employer from hiring a ticking bomb waiting to explode in a company. &quot; While Americans increasingly recognize that the workplace is no longer the sanctuary it once was , there are many misconceptions about violence and how to stop it , say experts reporting on new studies at the recent American Psychological Assn . meeting in Los Angeles . Among the myths : * The economic recession is responsible_for the upsurge in job-related violence . * Employers and employees are helpless to prevent violence . * The employer is to blame for violent incidents . * These incidents are random and unpredictable . * The security business is a growth_industry in corporate America . At the Memphis offices of Guardsmark Inc. , one of the largest security companies in the country , business is booming at a rate of 12 % a year . &quot; There is an urgency involved now , &quot; says Ira Lipman , chairman of Guardsmark and a longtime expert on crime . Security measures include guards , better lighting , alarms , surveillance cameras and bullet-proof barriers . But Lipman says they advise companies to do more_than hire extra security personnel . &quot; Some people say , ' Well , we ' ll put a guard on the door. ' But then they will not put a policy into effect about barring ex-employees from coming_into the organization . They think a guard will solve all their problems . You have to have a policy , a program , a system to try and eliminate threats that can occur , &quot; Lipman says . New studies show that workplace violence often stems from a combination of two factors : a hot-tempered individual and a stressful work environment . The worker to be feared is typically a male with a history of aggression , Mantell says . This person is often socially isolated , carries grudges and complains of the various injustices against him . He may have a track record of job-related injuries and involvement in labor-management disputes . He sees other people as the cause of his problems . Too often , these individuals also are fascinated with guns . Employers must carefully address the risks of this kind of employee to determine if behavior can be improved through counseling or a job change within the company , or whether the individual should be fired . Experts acknowledge that each option , particularly the latter , can present thorny ethical and legal problems . In his new book on workplace violence , Mantell describes the &quot; ticking bomb &quot; as this kind of employee who works in a toxic environment . The &quot; toxic &quot; workplace is usually highly stressed , understaffed and run in an authoritative , disciplined style with lots of labor-management disputes and a high rate of worker compensation claims . &quot; It ' s an environment where people feel management doesn ' t listen , &quot; Mantell says . An additional factor that can set_off an episode of violence is job layoffs , says Berkeley psychologist Ralph Catalano . His study of 14 # 000 individuals showed that people laid_off without having done anything wrong are six times as likely to commit violence at the workplace than they were when they held their job . But Catalano says his study shows that the economic recession , which has led to massive layoffs across the country , is probably not responsible_for the recent surge in workplace violence . He bases this conclusion on a finding in his study that suggests people who fear being laid_off were less likely to be violent , or to do anything that might lead to unemployment . Still , the result of corporate downsizing -- a leaner , more competitive , more efficient workplace -- may have something to do with the disturbing trend , Lipman says . &quot; We are in this great productivity cycle in America . There are a great_deal of competitive pressures . Those pressures are driving American business to require tougher standards and more focus , &quot; he says . Experts also note the general rise in violence -- including domestic violence -- and the proliferation of guns have fueled the problem . Moreover , Mantell says , psychological studies show that people entering the workplace today may be less equipped to handle job stress than ever before : the products of a weaker educational system , broken families and exposure to more violence on the streets . &quot; What is coming_into the workplace are people ill-prepared to deal with conflict , stress and authority , &quot; he says . Drug use is another factor that appears to have fueled workplace violence . Eighty percent of perpetrators are substance_abusers , says Nika Garrity , a workplace violence expert in Chicago . But , notes James Janik , a Chicago-based expert on crime : &quot; They are cold_sober when they come_in with their guns loaded . They arrive with a mission of what they are going_to do . They have it rehearsed. &quot; * Given this emerging profile , the prescriptions for prevention become clear . But , &quot; the vast majority of employers do nothing , &quot; Catalano says , in part because employees and employers alike often feel helpless to do anything about threatening individuals or tense offices . &quot; ( Workers ) believe it is not their place to report violence , &quot; Janik says . Or , he adds , they may feel reporting incidents won ' t do any good , will earn them a reprisal or will lead to the firing of a co-worker . Reporting threatening behavior can prevent a tragedy . Individuals who commit violent acts in the workplace almost always warn of their intentions , studies show . &quot; Individuals give verbal clues , &quot; such_as complaining about a co-worker or supervisor , says Chris Hatcher , a San Francisco psychologist who has produced a corporate training film on violence prevention . &quot; These people will give multiple clues to multiple people . But what often happens is the first-line supervisor does not recognize this or does not see a method by which the company can deal with that. &quot; A survey of 589 companies taken this year by the American Management Assn . found that more_than half reported incidents or threats of violence in the past four years . But in one-fourth of the incidents , warning signs were ignored by the victims . In one-third of the incidents , warning signs were ignored by co-workers and supervisors . To be sure , employers have to move cautiously when confronted with an employee or ex-employee who appears threatening . Companies are mandated by law to provide a safe workplace . But employers can be sued for libel or slander if they wrongly accuse or fire an employee before any offense has been committed . Increasingly , however , companies are instituting &quot; zero tolerance &quot; rules at_work -- any threat made by anyone will be taken seriously , Hatcher says . In addition to posting more security_guards on the grounds , some progressive companies are also holding violence-prevention workshops for employees and appointing teams to handle complaints or threats . Workers are also being instructed on what type of behavior is threatening and what channels to follow to report the threat . Companies are trying to create a more caring work environment by holding sessions in which employees can vent their frustrations or air grievances . The U.S. Social_Security_Administration has a pilot_program that was originally presented to workers at one busy New York office . &quot; It ' s not that we necessarily had any problems , &quot; says John Clark , public affairs director of the Social_Security_Administration . &quot; But , at this facility , the work tends to be repetitive -- a situation where stress comes_into play and supervisor-employee relationships can sometimes become strained. &quot; The program was so successful that employees in each region are being trained to present it at all Social_Security field offices , Clark says . And the U.S. Postal Service , reeling from its highly publicized shootings , has also begun a model prevention program that includes tighter pre-employment screening , town-hall meetings for employees , supervisor training to identify problem behavior and warning signs of trouble , and a work-behavior committee to monitor progress . Postal employees had come_to fear their workplaces , says Dr. David Reid , national medical director of the U.S. Postal Service . &quot; Employees feel more secure now. &quot;</TEXT>
