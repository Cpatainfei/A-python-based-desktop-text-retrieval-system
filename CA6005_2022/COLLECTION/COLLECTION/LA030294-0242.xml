   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : MIGHTY DUCKS NEED TO PAY PRICE FOR KARIYA , SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For five long months of watching and studying the daily habits of Canard clutchus grabus -- the Mighty Duck , as it is more commonly known -- we have been told to wait and see . Wait until March . See how the Ducks are doing then . If the Ducks are anywhere near the playoffs , we have been told , management would then do the right thing , the honorable thing , and reward the blind devotion of those 17 # 174 zealots who fill Anaheim Arena every home_game by signing top draft choice and folk-hero-waiting-to-happen Paul Kariya , just in time for a cavalry charge into the Stanley Cup tournament . Well , the calendar on the wall says today is March 2 . The standings in the newspaper say the Ducks are within three points of the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference , currently held by , of all people , the San Jose Sharks . The Olympics have been completed , meaning that Kariya , silver-medal star for Team Canada , is a free man . So , as thumbs twiddle and fingers drum all_over Orange County , the question goes_up : Where ' s Kariya ? The time has come_to bring him in , suit him up , send him out there . The Ducks are down to the final 20 games of their regular season , down to a three-team race with the Sharks and the Kings , those still sleep-walking Stanley Cup finalists who haven ' t won a game since Feb . 11 , when they beat the Ducks in Anaheim , 5-3 . If the Kings can ' t help themselves -- the canonization of St . McSorley has been postponed until further notice -- the Ducks have no such excuse . Their help is sitting in Boston right now , kicking_back in his girlfriend ' s home , waiting for the Ducks to make him an offer he can ' t refuse . As you might have read , Disney recently shook loose $ 2 million to buy another ice-skating Olympic silver medalist , Nancy Kerrigan , and put her to work Monday at Disney World . Kerrigan was to share a motorcade with Mickey_Mouse for a &quot; You ' re No . 2 ! &quot; ticker-tape parade . Kerrigan complied -- barely . She griped to Mickey along the way that &quot; this is the corniest thing I ' ve ever done , &quot; complained that her arm was tired from too_much waving and generally appeared so annoyed that a Disney operative had to remind her to &quot; Smile , honey &quot; before commencing a photo shoot . Maybe Michael Eisner noticed . If so , Kariya has to look_like the steal of the year . For $ 1.5 million , Kariya will skate for you , won ' t whine about it , will share the puck with his teammates , won ' t whine about it , will withstand bone-jarring body checks , won ' t whine about it , and has never expressed any aversion to car pooling with a guy in a mouse suit . Also , Kariya just might put Disney ' s hockey_team in the playoffs . Think_about that . You know the Duck players and coaches already have . Risking scorn and ridicule , the team had &quot; Skate For Eight &quot; T-shirts printed back in October , when hockey was still a novelty item in these parts and a 40-point season seemed an impossible dream . Now , the Ducks have 53 points and 24 victories , placing them within striking distance of the NHL expansion team record ( 31 victories ) as well as the playoffs , which have eluded every NHL expansion team since the league doubled in size in 1967 . Those T-shirts weren ' t just fashion statements . The players rallied around the idea , believing that hard work could put a team led by Bob Corkum and Terry Yake on par with a team led by Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille . Coach Ron Wilson and his staff dug_in , too , ignoring at least one newspaper poll that considered the Ducks the least talented team in the league and fashioning a successful , if not especially scintillating , dump-and-chase , bump-and-grind style of play . The players , the coaches , even the fans have overachieved . The string of sellouts at Anaheim Arena has been no less remarkable than the Ducks ' home-and-home sweep of the New York Rangers . Now , it is up_to management to hold_up its end . The Stephan Lebeau trade was one step_in the right direction . Signing Kariya , ASAP , would be another . Suddenly , the Ducks ' two-goals-and-a-cloud-of-ice-shavings offense would be toting a former 30-goal scorer , Lebeau , and a rookie playmaker whose puck-handling skills have drawn comparisons to Gretzky . While no guarantee of a triumphant ride into the postseason , it certainly beats the head-banging prospect of six more weeks of 3-2 defeats . At the moment , however , the Ducks and the Kariya are off in their separate corners , undecided . The Ducks , who made a second contract offer to Kariya on Tuesday , aren ' t sure they want to spend more_than $ 1 million a year on a player who was drafted behind Tampa Bay ' s Chris Gratton , who signed for $ 862 # 500 per season . Kariya , meanwhile , isn ' t sure he wants to join the Ducks now or return to the University of Maine and go_for back-to-back NCAA titles . Recent circumstances , however , could push both sides to an accord . Maine , charged with using an ineligible player , stands to forfeit 11 victories and two ties , which would drop its overall record to 2-30 and make any return by Kariya pointless . The Kings , expected to blow away the Ducks and the Sharks any day now , still continue to blow tires three nights a week . The race has come_to the Ducks and if they know their 1993 baseball history , they know what happened to another unexpected contender from Anaheim that failed to make the necessary mid-course improvements . If Kariya is the player the Ducks maintain he is -- &quot; franchise player , &quot; &quot; one of a kind &quot; -- then he is a player worth bending the salary structure for , especially now , with the Ducks so close to making a memorable first season unforgettable . Pull_back now , with the Ducks still Skating For Eight and Wilson just asking_for a fighting chance , and the Ducks risk sacrificing many of the gains they have made this season . Just like that , they slip from Something Truly Exciting And New to just another denizen in the land of broken promises .</TEXT>
