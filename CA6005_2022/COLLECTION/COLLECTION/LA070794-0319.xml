   <HEADLINE> FED PANEL SIGNALS NO PLANS FOR RATE HIKE ; POLICY : AFTER 2-DAY MEETING , GOVERNMENT SAYS ONLY THAT THERE IS ' NO FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENT. ' ANALYSTS WELCOME THE NEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal_Reserve ' s key policy-setting panel concluded a two-day closed-door session Wednesday without signaling any immediate plans to raise interest_rates again , calming jittery financial markets that feared another rate increase might be imminent . The Fed Open Market Committee , which sets the short-term interest_rates that influence economic_growth and inflation , adjourned its meeting at midday , and Fed spokesmen said only that &quot; there will be no further announcement. &quot; Most economists and traders , citing indications that U.S. economic_growth is slowing in several key sectors , said they do not expect the Fed to raise rates a fifth time this year . Some analysts , though , speculated that the Fed might feel compelled to act to halt the dollar ' s continuing decline against the Japanese and German currencies . Higher interest on U.S. bonds and Treasury securities attract foreign investment and tend to strengthen the dollar . The dollar fell to new postwar lows against the Japanese yen Wednesday and dropped to its lowest level of the year against the German mark . It would have taken a massive move by the Fed to slow the decline , market watchers said . The central_bank may still decide to raise rates in the next few days or weeks . However , the central_bank has apparently adopted a wait-and-see attitude in anticipation of June unemployment numbers Friday and possible word of concerted international action on interest or exchange_rates from the Group of Seven economic summit this weekend in Naples , Italy . Fed officials did not want to be seen preempting the actions of government leaders at the G-7 meeting , analysts said . Economists also suggested that the Fed will want to see whether the slowdown in automobile sales and the June dip in home-building activity are merely temporary blips in a fast-growing economy or signs of an overall economic cooling . The Open Market Committee is composed of Federal_Reserve_board members in Washington and Fed regional bank presidents . The panel next meets on Aug . 16 . The Fed has increased the federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge one another for overnight loans -- four times this year , from 3 % to 4.25 % . The most recent increase , on May 17 , was accompanied by an increase in the discount_rate -- the interest the Fed charges for direct_loans to banks . That rate stands at 3.5 % , up from 3 % , where it had been for nearly two years . The May discount_rate increase prompted a rise to 7.25 % in the prime lending rate for most big banks . Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in recent congressional testimony defended the increases as necessary to keep the economy from overheating and sparking a surge in inflation . And although he left open his options for further increases , Greenspan indicated at that time that the central_bank was likely to allow the effects of the four increases to work_through the economy before the bank would move to raise rates again . &quot; This is looking_to me as_good_as I ' ve seen an economy evolving in a balanced form in a very long period_of_time , &quot; Greenspan told the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee in late May after the last rate increases . &quot; The economy is moving at a fairly respectable pace . . . ( and ) could go_on for quite a long period_of_time , provided that inflationary imbalances don ' t emerge. &quot; Analysts welcomed the news of Wednesday ' s inaction , saying that inflation remains under_control and that higher interest_rates would only punish businesses and consumers while doing little to bolster the dollar or stabilize economic_growth . &quot; I ' m happy to hear that they broke_up and announced nothing , &quot; said Martin A . Regalia , chief economist at the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; The only ( announcement ) that could have come_out of that meeting would be either moderately bad or very bad news . We have dodged the first bullet in the six-shooter. &quot;</TEXT>
