   <TEXT> It is the year 2003 and a resurgent Iraq has invaded Kuwait -- again . But this time , Baghdad is brandishing a weapon that it didn ' t have in 1991 : a nuclear arsenal . And it is threatening to use it if allied forces intervene . The U.S. response is quick . In the Pentagon , military intelligence_officers pool the computer data they have painstakingly collected on the locations and interior layouts of all_of Iraq ' s nuclear facilities , including their structural weak_spots . Special operations teams sneak into Iraq from Saudi_Arabia , fanning_out -- in dangerous missions -- to disrupt communications at a pre-appointed hour . Tacticians prepare_for ground_attacks with special weapons , aimed at confusing the Iraqis and putting them off_guard . Squadrons of B-2 radar-evading Stealth bombers take_off to drop deep-penetrating , precision-guided munitions that can pinpoint the vulnerable parts of a nuclear facility and pierce its protective bunker -- without sending clouds of radioactive debris across the country . Finally , the United States deploys aircraft equipped with radar-tracking missile hunters that can destroy mobile ballistic-missile launchers . If any Scuds actually are fired , the military has a new theater air-defense missile system that can shoot them down . The air war is noisy , destructive and swift . Within a_few hours , the Iraqi nuclear threat is gone . No such high-technology scenario is yet within the capability of any U.S. military commander , but if the Pentagon has its way , at least some of it may be a part of the U.S. arsenal by the year 2003 . The need is indisputable . As the United States discovered to its horror during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , Iraq and perhaps other Third_World dictatorships are far more advanced in developing weapons of mass destruction than U.S. intelligence agencies had believed . Analysts said that U.S. troops escaped serious exposure to chemical and biological weapons mainly because Iraq was afraid of provoking the allies into using their nuclear_weapons . Next time , Baghdad may_not be so timid -- and may have nuclear_weapons as well . Moreover , military analysts pointed_out that of the handful of countries that the United States would be most likely to face on a battlefield in the next few years , virtually all -- Iran , Iraq , North_Korea , Libya and Syria -- have some weapons of mass destruction . Pentagon officials warned that even a_few of these &quot; special &quot; weapons , as they are called , could wipe_out regional airfields and depots that the United States would need to stage a second Operation_Desert_Storm and seriously jeopardize the chances for an allied victory . Yet , until relatively recently , the Pentagon had not made much of a push to equip U.S. forces to meet those kinds of threats . &quot; We simply weren ' t prepared to deal with what we were facing in Iraq , &quot; one U.S. official said . That may be about to change . Just last December , the Clinton_Administration launched a new &quot; counter-proliferation &quot; program aimed at equipping U.S. armed forces to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons at the beginning of any conflict -- before they can be used against U.S. troops . The plan , which is only beginning to get under way , calls_for a wide array of initiatives , from bolstering existing intelligence-gathering capability and developing new high-tech weapons to reorganizing the nation ' s military_forces to carry_out such a mission . The Administration has also begun sounding_out U.S. allies on the possibility of joining forces in the counter-proliferation effort . The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization has already begun work_on the broad outlines of such a plan . &quot; This really is a serious problem , &quot; said Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . The United States , he said , is &quot; behind the curve . . . . We need to have more tools in our toolbox &quot; to deal with weapons of mass destruction . The implications for the military are enormous . Facing enemies who have even a handful of nuclear_weapons might preclude the United States from using bases in countries such_as Saudi_Arabia or Japan , which might quickly become skittish about exposing themselves to nuclear fallout . The United States might be forced to find more -- and smaller -- staging_areas rather than concentrating its deployment at a handful of bases , as it did during Operation Desert Shield . Intelligence agencies would be used mainly to locate targets , as in anti-submarine warfare . And the Pentagon would have to reshape most of its forces to enable them to handle the new counter-proliferation mission . It would also need an array of new weapons and high_technology to help pinpoint -- and destroy -- weapons of mass destruction . Although most of those tools are a long way off , the Pentagon is looking_into a variety of proposals , from deep-penetrating bombs that can plow through thick concrete bunkers to tiny sensors -- shaped like twigs -- that can be dropped_in the countryside to detect chemical weapons . But , as Shalikashvili is the first to admit , the job will not be easy . To begin with , acquiring the technology and weapons is certain to be expensive . Some experts said it could take as much as $ 35 billion a year for a decade to finance a serious counter-proliferation program -- no easy job in an era of declining defense spending . Second , for all_the spectacularly high-tech weaponry that the United States displayed during the Persian_Gulf_War , Pentagon officials conceded that they still are a long way from having the technology to carry_out the new counter-proliferation mission . Critics of the initiative said they fear that it will only divert the Administration from traditional diplomatic efforts -- including renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- and expand the role of nuclear_weapons into the counter-proliferation area . Indeed , the defense_secretary ' s own annual report to Congress , submitted in January , calls_for formal consideration of &quot; whether and how U.S. nuclear_weapons and nuclear posture can play a role in deterring the acquisition or use of nuclear_weapons by other nations. &quot; The Administration , however , says it has no intention of permitting the use of U.S. nuclear_weapons to destroy those of other countries . Ashton B . Carter , assistant secretary_of_defense for international security policy , contended that the counter-proliferation program envisions using nothing but conventional weapons to deal with the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction . &quot; Our intention is to have a military that doesn ' t need to use ( nuclear , biological and chemical ) weapons , &quot; Carter said . &quot; We can use conventional forces to prevail anywhere around the world. &quot;</TEXT>
