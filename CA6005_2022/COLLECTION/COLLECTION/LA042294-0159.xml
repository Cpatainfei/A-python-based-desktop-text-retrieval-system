   <HEADLINE> GORE LABELS GLOBAL WARMING AS TOP PERIL ; ENVIRONMENT : THE VICE_PRESIDENT MARKS THE 24TH EARTH DAY ANNIVERSARY BY COMPARING THOSE SKEPTICAL OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE TO TOBACCO_INDUSTRY LEADERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vice_President Al Gore , marking the 24th anniversary of Earth Day , Thursday called the threat of global warming &quot; the most serious problem our civilization faces &quot; and likened skeptics to leaders of the embattled tobacco_industry . &quot; On one side there ' s a vast preponderance of serious scientists who have studied the evidence , and on the other hand we have a tiny minority of the self-interested who say , ' We just don ' t know , ' &quot; Gore said . Gore ' s comments were aimed at a vocal community of those who challenge scientists ' assertions that the buildup of carbon gases in the atmosphere will lead to a warming of Earth ' s surface , with dramatic disruptions in weather_conditions , agricultural production and sea_levels . Like tobacco_industry executives who have said there is no conclusive evidence that smoking can cause lung_cancer , he said that many U.S. industrialists are warning that science has not proved that the accumulation of carbon gases will lead to the feared &quot; global warming &quot; effects . With many such industrialists in his audience , Gore scoffed that &quot; there was a time earlier in ( the tobacco ) debate when some people actually believed &quot; the tobacco_industry ' s denials . The vice_president ' s speech underscored the White_House ' s challenge as it seeks to carry_out President Clinton ' s promise to reduce the nation ' s emissions of greenhouse gases . In addition to skeptics resistant to making those reductions , the pace and urgency of the Administration ' s proposed solutions are frustrating environmentalists . While Gore slammed the skeptics Thursday , the President gently chided environmentalists , telling an Earth Day gathering in the capital that &quot; government should encourage people to work together , not pit business and workers and environmentalists against each other. &quot; The Administration ' s comments came a day after the Energy_Department signed an accord with more_than 600 members of the Electric Utility Industry to reduce greenhouse gases . Under the memorandum of understanding , utilities voluntarily would adopt a variety of measures designed to reduce their release of carbon gases . Environmentalists have attacked the agreement -- and the Administration ' s efforts to draw industries into &quot; partnerships &quot; with government to achieve its environmental goals . The Sierra Club , for instance , charged Thursday that the Administration ' s proposal for reducing greenhouse gases -- announced last fall -- will fail to stabilize those emissions at the 1990 level , as Clinton promised . The United States would have to cut 139 million metric_tons of carbon emissions to meet its goals , but the plan Clinton has laid_out will reduce those emissions by only about half of that , a Sierra Club analysis warned . &quot; This plan bows to polluters but merely doffs its hat to the global warming problem , &quot; Sierra Club analyst Daniel Becker said . &quot; It ' s good for polluter public relations but doesn ' t do much for the planet. &quot; In response to such charges , Gore held_out an olive_branch to environmental groups , declaring that they are playing a crucial role in holding the Administration to its promises . &quot; We need you ; we need you , &quot; Gore said . &quot; Keep it up. &quot; On Thursday , Gore cited not only scientists , but also a study from the Travelers Corp . insurance_company that said even a modest 0.9-degree Fahrenheit increase in average global temperature by 2010 could extend the hurricane season by 20 days , cause a 33 % jump in hurricane landfalls in the United States , increase storms ' severity and cause a 30 % annual rise in catastrophic U.S. losses from storms .</TEXT>
