   <HEADLINE> OPPOSITION SOCIALIST ALLIANCE WINS PLURALITY IN SRI LANKA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A socialist alliance that wants to try negotiating an end to Sri Lanka ' s 11-year-old civil_war emerged as the top vote-getter in the troubled island nation ' s parliamentary election , official results showed Wednesday . But even as happy backers of the People ' s Alliance celebrated their victory by exploding firecrackers , the ruling United National Party was furiously trying to cobble_together a coalition to safeguard its 17-year unbroken grip on power . With the voters ' verdict now leaving no single party with a working legislative majority , whoever forms Sri Lanka ' s new government will find it a &quot; dicey affair , &quot; predicted Gamini Wijesekara , United National Party general secretary . In Tuesday ' s vote , the leftist People ' s Alliance won 105 seats to the ruling party ' s 94 , according to the tally issued by the election commissioner ' s office . ( The other 26 seats were captured by minority Hindu and Muslim parties. ) The balloting , in which an estimated 75 % of Sri Lanka ' s nearly 11 million voters took_part , was a virtual referendum on President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga ' s liberal economic_policies , on the hard line he has taken toward the Tamil ethnic insurgency and on alleged widespread official corruption . After the proclamation of the returns , Wijetunga is supposed to choose a new prime_minister . But since neither his party nor the People ' s Alliance won an outright 113-seat majority in the 225-member legislature , it was not clear Wednesday night what he would do . &quot; I appeal_to all my countrymen to remain calm , &quot; Wijetunga said in a televised address . &quot; You may rest assured that I will be acting in terms of the constitution. &quot; The election followed the most violent political_campaign in the Indian_Ocean nation ' s history . More_than 3 # 000 street clashes were reported in the monthlong run-up to election_day , and at least 20 people , most of them allied_with the opposition , were slain . On Tuesday , Tamil guerrillas , who called_for a voter boycott , blew_up a navy ship in northern Sri Lanka , killing two sailors . But otherwise , the insurgents -- who are fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka ' s north and east -- did not try to disrupt the election . To prevent any unrest , Wijetunga declared a state of emergency immediately after the polls closed . On Wednesday , he extended a round-the-clock curfew until Friday , and soldiers patrolled the nearly empty streets of the capital , Colombo . Scrambling to stay in power , the United National Party on Wednesday night was reportedly trying to entice the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress , a_People ' s Alliance ally that won seven parliamentary seats for itself , into a coalition by offering it three Cabinet positions . Sources in the ruling party confidently predicted they could win_over the Muslim group , as well as three Tamil parties that won a total of 17 seats . Meanwhile , the five-party People ' s Alliance also started wooing the small minority parties to forge a majority in Parliament . Vehicles were sent to the north and east of the island to bring the leaders of the Tamil groups to Colombo for negotiations , one alliance source said . The opposition alliance -- led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party , which ruled the island from 1970 to 1977 -- campaigned for an end to what it termed widespread government graft and corruption . It also pledged to negotiate with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels . Wijetunga took power in May , 1993 , after strongman President Ranasinghe Premadasa was blown_up by a suicide bomber believed to be a Tamil rebel . Although far from being as highhanded as his predecessor , Wijetunga has flatly refused to consider negotiations with the insurgents , saying the problem is not one of ethnic discontent but of terrorism .</TEXT>
