   <HEADLINE> ROSH HASHANAH ; STARTING A SWEET YEAR IN THE GARDEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This year Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown Monday , which just happens to be Labor_Day . My family will gather to celebrate this double occasion with a barbecue and early dinner that will allow everyone to attend evening synagogue services without rushing . The weather is usually still warm at this time of the year , so we will eat_in the garden . The menu starts with a refreshing cup of cold tomato soup and chunks of fresh mozzarella cheese . The easy-to-prepare main_course is marinated grilled salmon kebabs served on a bed of stewed leeks . The whole-wheat challah rolls can be made several days in_advance and stored in the freezer . A mixed green_salad will round_out the meal . For dessert , the holiday apple cake made with honey symbolizes &quot; a sweet year , &quot; a Jewish tradition that dates_from Biblical times . Vanilla_ice_cream , home-made or store-bought , is a perfect addition . * This menu is a light and welcome change from the traditional chopped liver , chicken_soup with matzo_balls and stuffed roast chicken dinner I have served in the past .
