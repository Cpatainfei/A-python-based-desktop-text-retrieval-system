   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; BOND PACKAGE SHAPED BY BUDGET , POLITICS ; FINANCES : COMPROMISE PLAN WOULD PAY FOR BRIDGE WORK AND RESCUE HIGHWAY PROJECTS WITHOUT RAISING TAXES . BUT THE GAMBLE FACES VOTES BY LAWMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In packaging a $ 2-billion earthquake bond measure for the June ballot , the governor and legislative leaders avoided a head-on collision with mounting financial problems that threatened to force a tax increase or shut_down politically popular highway projects . The eleventh-hour agreement to designate nearly half the bond funds for the strengthening of bridges most vulnerable to earthquake damage put_off for this election year the necessity of a sales or gas tax increase to pay_for roads . And it postponed the state ' s reckoning with at least a $ 2.5-billion shortfall in its transportation program . At the same time , it solved a nettlesome problem for lawmakers in the San Francisco Bay Area who were facing a $ 560-million bill for the seismic retrofitting of toll bridges and no politically palatable way to pay_for it . For Republican Gov . Pete Wilson , the compromise package defused a potentially explosive campaign issue sparked by the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , which collapsed portions of six Los Angeles freeways and focused attention on the slow progress that Caltrans has made in strengthening the state ' s highway bridges to resist quake damage . A Times special report last month found that about 80 % of the freeway structures considered most vulnerable in an earthquake have not been retrofitted more_than four years after the Loma Prieta quake sent 43 people to their deaths on Bay Area freeways and bridges . The Wilson Administration on Thursday announced a plan to accelerate the lagging retrofitting program by at least a year . Highway bridges would be strengthened by the end of 1995 , while toll bridges would be fixed by the end of 1997 . After the Loma Prieta earthquake dramatically underscored the weakness of some freeway structures , Caltrans embarked_on an ambitious program to strengthen the concrete columns that support about 1 # 300 freeway bridges considered most at risk in a major temblor . To reduce the likelihood that the concrete in the columns will blow_out when subjected_to intense shaking , Caltrans developed a program to wrap the columns in steel jackets . Even before the Northridge quake , the soaring costs of this seismic strengthening program threatened to gobble_up scarce dollars from other transportation projects . These include maintenance and safety repairs on freeways , widening of roadways and construction of highways , as well as improvements to ramps and overpasses . &quot; When you have insufficient revenues you do begin to cannibalize , &quot; said Art Bauer , executive_director of Californians for Better Transportation , an industry and local_government lobbying group . Last month , the nonpartisan legislative analyst ' s office warned lawmakers that the state was $ 2.5 billion short on the revenue needed to complete a seven-year master_plan for transportation improvements . The financial crunch was blamed on the recession , which reduced sales and gasoline_tax receipts , and on the increased fuel efficiency of motor_vehicles that has eaten_into collections from the 18-cent-per-gallon state tax . The analyst ' s office also said the defeat of a rail bond measure in 1992 and the transfer of transportation revenues to help balance the state ' s financially troubled general fund has contributed to Caltrans funding problems . Without additional money , the analyst ' s office concluded , the transportation department faces sharp declines in spending on maintenance of highways and construction projects in the fiscal_year that begins July 1 . The financial problem would be aggravated , the analyst said , by the fact that &quot; the existing seismic retrofit program . . . has suffered delays and is likely to cost more_than currently estimated by Caltrans. &quot; The analyst ' s findings reinforced Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels ' assessment at a January meeting of legislators and transportation lobbyists that the highway program was going &quot; off the cliff &quot; next year because of insufficient revenues . Several key lawmakers and Wilson ' s Democratic challengers in the governor ' s race proposed tax increases to avoid the financial crisis , complete the retrofitting work and prevent the cancellation of new construction projects . But Wilson adamantly opposed increasing taxes . &quot; He feels a tax increase would just be fatal to an economy that ' s on a turnaround , &quot; Wilson spokesman Paul Kranhold said . But faced with criticism that the Administration had not moved fast enough to prevent freeway failures in future quakes , Wilson needed a means to defuse the issue . First he announced the acceleration of the seismic program , and then came the announcement of the bond issue to pay_for it . Although a sales tax increase had been used to pay_for repairs after the Loma Prieta quake , Administration officials said the governor believed that bonds were the most appropriate way to cover costs associated with the Northridge quake and to strengthen freeways for future quakes . H . D . Palmer , assistant director of the Department of Finance , said Wilson believes the economy is much too weak to support a tax increase . Palmer said bonds avoid a tax_hike and allow the state to take_advantage of exceptionally low interest_rates . &quot; At a time when state economy is stabilizing , the last thing you want to do is choke_off or thwart that potential economic recovery by saddling the state ' s economy with additional taxes , &quot; Palmer said . The deal that emerged from the closed-door negotiations with top legislative leaders included a concession from Wilson that made_it politically attractive to the two top Democratic leaders -- Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) -- both of whom represent the Bay Area . Previously , Wilson had insisted that the $ 650-million price_tag for strengthening all_of the state ' s toll bridges -- most of them in the Bay Area -- come from tolls paid by motorists using the spans . Instead , the compromise calls_for the cost to be borne by the bond issue , sparing Bay Area motorists that burden . &quot; He ' s backtracked . . . to get political support from Northern California , &quot; said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) . Katz said the move , if successful , delays the crisis in the state transportation program . &quot; What he ' s trading here , &quot; Katz said , &quot; is long-term debt as opposed to dealing with the problem today . He ' s making a political decision to go_for a bond versus a sales tax , thinking that bonds are less onerous in the public ' s mind than a tax increase. &quot; However , Katz said the strategy is a gamble because the bonds still must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature and a majority of those casting ballots in the June 7 election . If the plan fails at either juncture , Katz said , the state ' s political_leaders will face the dilemma they have been trying to avoid -- deciding whether to delay new highway projects or approve a tax increase . And the cost of the retrofitting program could grow significantly as Caltrans completes a review of an additional 1 # 500 bridges , many of which were deemed seismically safe but are being re-evaluated in light of the failure of bridges during the Northridge quake . The use of bonds to pay_for seismic retrofitting of bridges is a dramatic departure from the state ' s traditional policy that highway improvements should be handled on a pay-as-you-go basis . After the governor and the legislative leadership announced their compromise bond proposal , critics were quick to raise questions about the new policy direction . &quot; From a political standpoint this is a deft compromise , but from a policy standpoint it is a disaster , &quot; said Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin L . Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) . Officials have estimated that over the 20-year life of the bonds , debt service will cost an additional $ 1.4 billion . Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) and Katz complained that in the leadership ' s zeal to solve a political problem , they had put forth a proposal that would not only increase costs but saddle future generations with mammoth debt . &quot; I see no rationale for this except politics , &quot; said Hayden , who is running_for governor . &quot; In order to keep the expansion of interchanges and off-ramps rolling . . . they had to find this new source of money for seismic so that it didn ' t compete with the new projects. &quot;</TEXT>
