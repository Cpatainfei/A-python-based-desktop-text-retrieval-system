   <HEADLINE> 3 LAWS INSPIRED BY ANTONOVICH CASE SIGNED ; ETHICS : GOVERNOR ENACTS THREE BILLS MAKING OFFICIALS LIABLE FOR COURT DAMAGES ARISING FROM MISCONDUCT . THEY STEM FROM 1993 CASE , NOW ON APPEAL , IN WHICH THE SUPERVISOR CALLED A JUDGE ON BEHALF OF A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson has signed three bills protecting taxpayers from court damages incurred by elected officials found liable for misconduct . The bills were inspired by a 1993 case in which a jury found Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich liable for conspiring to influence a judge on behalf of a campaign contributor . Although the case is being appealed , county lawyers have agreed to pay an unspecified portion of the $ 1.2 million in compensatory damages that were awarded . The new laws specify that government entities , like counties or cities , do not have to pay damages if their elected officials get themselves into trouble by actions ranging from intervening in court cases to engaging in sexual_harassment to committing a felony . If an elected official is unable to afford the court costs , public agencies still have the option of making the payments , but the new laws require them to seek reimbursement from the official . &quot; It serves notice to all politicians . . . statewide that the taxpayers will not be left holding the bag for improprieties , &quot; said Sean Walsh , Wilson ' s spokesman . Assemblywoman Debra Bowen ( D-Marina del Rey ) wrote the bill , AB 2467 , that most closely mirrors the circumstances of the Antonovich case . It specifically targets cases in which elected officials try to intervene in a judicial_proceeding . &quot; Under this bill , any elected official who chooses to intervene in a court proceeding will do so at his or her own financial risk -- not at the risk of the taxpayers ' wallets , &quot; Bowen said . Antonovich was not available for comment , but a spokesman said he favored such changes in the law . The new laws , however , will not retroactively apply to the Antonovich case . &quot; We supported these bills because they would bring an end to frivolous lawsuits against deep pocket entities , &quot; said Steven Herbert , Antonovich ' s spokesman . Antonovich , a supervisor since 1980 , says he did nothing improper five years ago when he telephoned a judge to put_in a good_word for campaign contributor Krikor Suri and his jewelry business partners . Suri and his associates were involved in a lawsuit against another partner . * Campaign reports show that Suri and his companies contributed $ 19 # 000 to Antonovich ' s campaigns from 1985 to 1989 , loaned him $ 10 # 000 about a month before he called the judge and made a $ 3 # 000 contribution four days before he called . Two months after Antonovich ' s phone_call , Judge Eric Younger excused himself from the lawsuit , explaining in a deposition that he felt &quot; uncomfortable about the call either having an impact or the appearance of an impact. &quot; Businessman Avedis Kasparian , who opposed Suri in the first lawsuit , then filed a new suit against Antonovich , the county , Suri and his partners , complaining that he lost money because the judge was influenced by Antonovich . A Norwalk Superior_Court jury agreed , holding the defendants liable for $ 1.2 million in compensatory damages . Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) wrote one of the other two bills , AB 2508 , limiting government liability , but his was broader than Bowen ' s and would also cover cases of sexual_harassment , sexual battery and attempts to inflict emotional distress . Katz took_note not only of the Antonovich case but also of a sexual_harassment lawsuit pending against Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden . &quot; The message I wanted to send was that public officials who screw_up cannot expect taxpayers to pay_up for them , &quot; Katz said . &quot; People who behave unethically and illegally should be held accountable and they ought to pay_up first. &quot; The third bill in the package , AB 2522 , was written by Assemblyman Paul Horcher ( R-Diamond Bar ) . Although Horcher told a legislative committee it stemmed in part from his concerns over the Antonovich case , he said it more directly addressed wrongdoing by municipal elected officials -- such_as one city councilman who sued constituents for trying to recall him . Horcher ' s bill states that government entities will be liable for neither damages nor defense costs if an elected official is convicted of a felony .</TEXT>
