   <TEXT> International Olympic Committee_member Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles was a central figure in one of the most heart-tugging medal ceremonies of this or any other Olympics , presenting the gold to speedskater Dan Jansen Friday for his victory in the 1 # 000 meters . Having presented a gold medal to speedskater Bonnie Blair after she won the 500 meters two years ago in Albertville , France , and figuring that Blair would also win here , DeFrantz requested to the IOC before the Games began that she be allowed to do the honors again after that race . But South_Korean IOC member Kim Un Young also requested that race , figuring that his compatriot , Yoo Sun Hee , would win . Because he is an IOC vice resident , his request was given priority . DeFrantz was given a consolation , the men ' s 1 # 000 . &quot; I couldn ' t help but think_about the wrestler , Jeff Blatnick , in the 1984 Summer Olympics , who won the gold medal and said , ' I ' m one lucky dude , ' &quot; DeFrantz said . &quot; Well , I ' m one lucky dude. &quot; By the way , IOC member Kim is no speedskating expert . His pick , Yoo , finished fifth Saturday . Blair won . RANDY HARVEY</TEXT>
