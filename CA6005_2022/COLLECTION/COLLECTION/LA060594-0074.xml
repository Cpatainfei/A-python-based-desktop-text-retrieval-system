   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : SOMETIMES YOU JUST can ' t CURB THE URBAN ANIMAL WITHIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A car , a_couple_of runners , a confrontation . It was a total urban moment , that split_second in which your civilized veneer peels away and you become what you detest -- an angry animal ready to pounce . My partner and I were trotting toward the beach on the first leg of a three-mile workout . We have to cross three busy streets to get_to the unrestricted seaside portion of our run , and we do so at our peril . But we are thrill seekers . We eschew traffic_lights in favor of the far more dangerous crosswalks , strewn like mines across our path . After complaining about our husbands ' lack of affinity for dirty diapers ( 10 minutes ) , gossiping about our co-workers ( 10 minutes ) , we often fill the remaining time discussing the relative merits of crosswalks and stop lights . We have come_to the conclusion that the traffic engineers are right : Crosswalks provide pedestrians with a false sense of security and not much else . Still , we feel self-righteous about our rights-of-way and have developed a_few techniques to get drivers to stop . Sometimes we put our hands in the air and command them to &quot; Stop . . . in the name of love , before you break my legs. &quot; Sometimes we flail our arms , looking panicked , so they think something is wrong . Occasionally , this shocks drivers out of their stupor . More often than not , we are the ones who stop , because most Los Angeles drivers regard the sight of a person standing in a crosswalk as an optional stop , not a required one . They might stop , but only if they are feeling especially gracious and aren ' t too busy putting_on lipstick , checking their hair plugs_in the rear-view mirror or chatting on the car phone . I have no idea what the guy in the Mercedes was doing when we entered the crosswalk . * On the day in_question , we were plodding westward and were halfway across the intersection when a black southbound Mercedes seemed as if it were going_to barrel right through the crosswalk , and -- by extension -- us . At the last minute , the driver slammed_on his brakes . The nose of his car came_to a stop rather too close to our calves for comfort . I took revenge , as I usually do , by walking verrrry slooowwly in front of his car -- the better to annoy him for being in such a hurry and for scaring us . My highly verbal , ultra-sophisticated running partner , however , turned_on him . &quot; You ( expletive often used for emphasis ) ( vulgarity for rear_end ) ! &quot; The driver , who I guess wasn ' t in a hurry after all , lowered his passenger window . &quot; What did you call me ? &quot; She reprised her comments , this time con brio . &quot; Hey ! &quot; he yelled , &quot; I stopped for your fat ( expletive used for emphasis ) ( vulgarity for rear_ends ) ! &quot; Some alien force -- afflicted with coprophilia -- invaded my body and took_control . It wheeled me around . It opened my mouth . I heard my voice : &quot; Eat ( should be obvious ) , you ( a compound vulgar noun that I would be embarrassed if my mother were able to figure_out by reading this ) ! &quot; I was shocked . Such profanity , such angry poetry , such pleasure . Where did that come from ? And why did_it feel so good ? In a trice , I viscerally understood Jack Nicholson wanting to attack the car of that poor guy ( well , formerly poor now that they ' ve settled ) who cut him off in traffic at Toluca Lake in February . ( Nicholson was driving . . . a black Mercedes. ) If I ' d had a golf_club on me , who knows what might have happened ? The afterglow , I must say , was incredible . Best run we ' ve had in weeks . * Generally , I avoid such entanglements . Like crosswalks , they are dangerous and unpredictable . You enter at your own risk . I suppose we thought we were safe because someone driving a luxury car has too_much to lose to really get nutty ( pompous actors excepted ) or maybe because we were steps away from a staircase leading to the beach , an easy escape . But there was something discomfitingly invigorating about this exchange . Maybe it just felt good to yell . Maybe we just needed to relieve our pent-up frustrations . And yet . . . isn ' t that why we run ? Could the stress of running in the city , wondered my partner , outweigh the benefits ? We spent the rest of our jog devising fabulous , witty things we wished we ' d said to the Mercedes driver . His presumed anatomical shortcomings were high on our list of imagined ripostes . Maybe there ' s something wrong with me , but I kind of hope we see him again .</TEXT>
