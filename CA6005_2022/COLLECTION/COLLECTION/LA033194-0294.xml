   <HEADLINE> U.S. MOVES TO SIMPLIFY OVERSEAS TECHNOLOGY SALES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration lifted export restrictions Wednesday on the sale of most commercial computer and telecommunications_equipment to Russia , Eastern Europe and China , closing a chapter in the Cold_War and giving U.S. manufacturers access to billions of dollars of business a year . The announcement , which surprised and delighted industry officials meeting at a Washington hotel , coincided with a decision to close_down the international agency that has controlled exports of Western weapons and weapons-related technologies to the former Soviet Bloc for 45 years . The Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , known as Cocom , officially goes_out of business today . Clinton_Administration officials , meeting with European , Japanese and Australian counterparts in The Hague , Netherlands , were unable to get agreement on creating a successor to Cocom that would control weapons-related exports to &quot; countries of concern &quot; -- North_Korea , Libya , Iran and Iraq . The new agency would also continue to control exports to all nations of the most threatening technologies , those dealing with nuclear and chemical weapons , and missile technology . While negotiations on a successor agency continue , the Cocom nations promised to keep_in place current restrictions on exports of products with military purposes . They will press for an agreement before year ' s end . &quot; We still live_in a world of hazards , &quot; said Robert E . Rubin , head of the White_House National Economic Council , who announced the new policy . Underlining the tug and pull of the Administration ' s export policy , he also stressed President Clinton ' s desire to help U.S. companies compete abroad . Although the 17 Cocom members will continue cooperating on weapons proliferation policy , each country is now free to make its own decision about what to export .</TEXT>
