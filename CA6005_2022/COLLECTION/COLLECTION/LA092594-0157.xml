   <HEADLINE> NO MORE GREEN HAIR ; GROWING NUMBER OF SOUTHLAND POOL OWNERS ARE USING CHLORINE ALTERNATIVES TO DESTROY CONTAMINANTS IN WATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Screenwriter Robert Towne ' s hair had turned green . His skin was chewed_up , his eyes burned constantly , and he said he reeked of a &quot; God-awful after-smell. &quot; The effects of swimming several thousand yards a day , every day , in his chlorinated , back-yard lap pool were more_than Towne could endure . So Towne investigated alternatives to chlorine , then switched to ozone , a powerful chemical that kills pool contaminants much faster than chlorine . Europeans have used ozone to purify their public pools and drinking_water for decades , but it is only now gaining acceptance in the United States . &quot; It ' s a joy to swim in it , &quot; Towne said . &quot; I hate to take a shower after swimming in the pool . My pool water is much cleaner than my tap water. &quot; Towne is among a small but growing number of Southern California ' s 450 # 000 pool owners who are seeking to reduce or eliminate chlorine from their pools . Three of the most popular options are ozone , ionization and chlorine generators . Large public pools also are moving away from relying solely on chlorine . Pierce College is testing a combination of ozone and bromine pellets ; UC Santa Barbara will be sanitizing three pools in its new aquatics complex with ozone and liquid chlorine later this year . Typically , pool owners ( or a pool service ) test pool water at least once a week for chlorine , pH , acid demand and total alkalinity . Based on the results , they pour in liquid chlorine by the gallon or fill floating dispensers with chlorine tablets , as well as mix_in a host of other chemicals to clean and balance the water . On a regular basis , they may also &quot; shock &quot; the pool with a megadose of chlorine to kill bacteria , viruses and algae that have gotten_out of hand , despite the weekly routine . Ozone , as Towne found , is an appealing option . His pool water is remarkably clear . It glistens and sparkles beneath dappled sunlight . The pool is a convincing example of how effective the gas can be . Ozone is a powerful oxidizer , killing much faster than chlorine . It quickly attacks bacteria and viruses and destroys body oils , suntan lotion , urine and other contaminants that readily turn a swimming_pool into a murky , scummy mess . Ozone also coagulates tiny minerals into larger pieces , making them easier for a filter to capture . A jolt of electricity or light forms ozone by breaking_up oxygen molecules , then reforming them into ozone molecules . The problem is ozone lasts only about 20 minutes before it converts back to oxygen . In a swimming_pool , that means an ozone generator should run_for the better part of the day . Robert Towne sanitizes his 15-by-75-foot lap pool 12 hours a day using a system_called &quot; corona_discharge , &quot; which zaps very dry air with high-voltage electricity to create highly concentrated ozone . Sparks flicker like fireflies trapped inside slender , glass tubes when the system is_on . The ozone that the sparks create disinfects the pool water in a chamber . The gas is vented into carbon filter that absorbs it , while the clean , rejuvenated water returns to the pool . &quot; This pool is 100 % chlorine-free , &quot; said Steve Stubbs , president of Coastline Pool Construction of Los Angeles , who installed the unit . &quot; The absolute key is ( ozone ) distribution . . . . I have found that the corona_discharge , if it ' s done properly and applied forcefully , is pretty incredible. &quot; Stubbs added that a serviceman comes twice a week to clean the filters and adds only muriatic_acid to maintain the pH level . Such purity and technology bear a hefty price_tag . Stubbs said corona_discharge systems range from $ 10 # 000 to $ 25 # 000 , depending_on the pool ' s configuration , location and needs . Stubbs recently installed a $ 40 # 000 set of similar ozone units on the Santa Monica YMCA ' s indoor swimming_pools , where 300 to 400 people swim daily . However , the pools are not be chlorine free . A highly concentrated dose of ozone cleans the water , then is vented into a special charcoal filter and destroyed . Bromine , a halogen related to chlorine , is added just before the water goes_back into the pool , to conform_to a state health_code requiring all public pools to maintain a free chlorine residual of at least 1.5 parts per million while using a stabilizing chemical . Although homeowners do not have to abide_by the free chlorine residual rule , many still cannot bear the lofty cost of corona_discharge . An alternative is ozone produced by ultraviolet_light , with units priced ( before installation ) from $ 300 for a small spa to $ 2 # 500 for a standard pool . UV lamps last several years : replacement lamps cost about $ 100 . UV light creates a low concentration of ozone , so the ozonated water can be injected directly into the pool via special jets or through the pool ' s return line . The ozonated water bubbles to the surface , sometimes releasing a faint odor . &quot; It has an electrical smell , kind of like lightning or what old sewing_machines give_off , &quot; described Grant Castleberg , who has used an ozone generator to disinfect his Santa Barbara swimming_pool for 15 years . Because the ozone concentration is lower and the gas ' life is so short , Paulette Scoville , a spokesperson for San Luis Obispo-based Del Industries , which has manufactured ozone systems for 21 years , recommends that UV-ozone owners never turn_off their pumps . Even still , algae and bacteria can overwhelm the system . &quot; You need to shock the pool occasionally , &quot; said Kim Martin of Golden West Pools in Newbury Park . &quot; In their literature , the ozone companies claim a 90 % reduction ( in chlorine consumption ) . If you use only 10 % chlorine , that ' s pretty good. &quot; Added Castleberg : &quot; I don ' t have to use chlorine for disinfecting . . . . I don ' t check the chlorine level at all . I just use ( chlorine ) to control algae. &quot; A second chlorine alternative is to clean the pool water with ions ; an idea that has lept from covered wagons to outer space and now to swimming pools . Western pioneers are said to have used a rudimentary ionization system to purify their drinking_water : they dropped copper and silver coins into the wooden water casks that they had strapped to their covered wagons . The jerking of the wagons apparently jostled the coins enough to release ions to kill bacteria and control algae . This century , NASA scientists studied using silver ionizers to disinfect drinking_water on the Apollo spacecraft . In swimming_pools , an ion generator produces silver ions to kill bacteria and viruses , and copper ions to kill algae . &quot; The only thing it ( ionization ) will not do is oxidize organic material , like body_wastes from swimmers , &quot; said Tom Stieb of Nova Specialties in Santa Barbara , who installs commercial , computer-controlled ion generators on the large , custom pools that he builds . &quot; You have to burn that out occasionally , or you will overwhelm ionization as far as algae control. &quot; Stieb advises his clients to shock their pools with potassium monopersulfate once every two weeks in the summer and every six weeks in the winter , instead of using chlorine or bromine . He said the granulated powder is a rapid oxidizer . &quot; In 10 minutes , it ' s completely gone . There ' s no odor . It doesn ' t bleach hair or eat swimming suits. &quot; Ionization requires precise monitoring of copper levels , total dissolved solids ( TDS ) and pH . Stieb said when the TDS exceed 1 # 000 ppm , it ' s time to drain the pool . Not willing to leave the pH balance to chance , Stieb routinely installs automatic pH controllers along with the ionization units . Packages range_in price from $ 4 # 000 to $ 6 # 000 , including $ 1 # 500 for a pH controller . Much smaller , less sophisticated residential model ionizers cost about $ 500 , with the ion-generating unit mounted on the pool ' s return line . Stieb said the flow cell that dissolves the silver and copper into the water typically lasts four to six months . Replacement cells may cost $ 50 to $ 100 . Big or small , ion generators are controversial . &quot; I want to tell you right upfront , they ( ionizers ) work . But there are problems . Water chemistry is more important than anything else , &quot; said Ernie Nebiolini of Sunrise Pools in Sacramento . &quot; If they get too_much copper into the pool , that turns the walls blue , &quot; Nebiolini said . &quot; You get all kinds of algae problems . They do not work efficiently above 90 or so degrees . People were calling me and saying ' My pool is turning green. ' ' It smells. ' &quot; Nebiolini said he &quot; got burned &quot; by ionizers . He finally removed &quot; many , many &quot; ionizers that he had installed and replaced them with devices called chlorine generators , the third popular method of sanitizing swimming_pools . Chlorine generators create a simple form of chlorine out of rock_salt . In-line chlorine generators , sometimes called saltwater generators , call_for dumping several bags of rock_salt directly into the pool water . The salty water circulates through the filter system . A small electrical charge zips through the water just before the water returns to the pool , splitting the salt into sodium and simple chlorine or hypochlorous_acid . &quot; Hypochlorous acid is very unique in that its properties maintain a bacteria-free pool without a chloramine buildup , &quot; said Ron Cardinal , general_manager of Kreepy Krauly West , a manufacturer of pool-cleaning equipment . &quot; You never ever have to shock a pool with an electrolytic converter because you always have a pool that is free_of chloramines. &quot; Organic chloramines -- byproducts after the chlorine has done its work -- are what swimmers should truly blame when they complain about a stench of chlorine , said Terry Fitch , vice_president and general_manager of Anthony Pools in Carson . &quot; If you ' re smelling chlorine that means there are chloramines in the water . The water molecule has a casing on it , so it ' s not accepting the sanitizer , &quot; Fitch explained . &quot; I don ' t go near a pool where I can smell the chlorine. &quot; Anthony Pools ' chlorine generators convert salt to an ounce of chlorine gas a day in a brine tank . A venturi_tube feeds the gas into the return line just before the water flows back into the pool . &quot; We do more renovation of old pools than new pools . . . . We won ' t put a saltwater generator on an old pool because we know there ' s going_to be some reaction on the galvanized and copper piping , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; ( But ) because we ' re making chlorine off-site , there ' s no negative impact on the pipes. &quot; The process that creates chlorine gas also produces caustic lye . Fitch said the lye is automatically bled off , fed into the pool water and used as a pH buffer , reducing the need to add as much muriatic_acid to balance the pH . Anthony Pools commonly packages its chlorine generators with two other specialty products . A series of zinc baffles installed within the plumbing releases zinc ions to kill algae . And a band of super magnets , strapped onto the pipes , causes any tiny mineral particles to coagulate , to reach a size large enough for a filter to trap . Altogether , the three-part system costs about $ 1 # 600 to install . Single in-line , saltwater chlorine generators range from $ 550 to $ 1 # 000 or more , with installation extra . Regardless of the type of chlorine generator , proponents say the best thing about the units is that they maintain the chlorine at a constant balance , preventing the water -- and swimmers -- from suffering wild swings in chlorine concentration . &quot; The biggest problem for a typical guy who doesn ' t have automation is that the chlorine level is all_over the place , &quot; Fitch said . &quot; The water looks terrible , so he pours in chlorine . Then the level is too high . The first_person who swims , their hair turns all green. &quot; Aida Barta said she ' s been pleased to discover that she can dive in and swim with her eyes open while her saltwater generator chlorinates her Camarillo lap pool . Adds Dusty Bruce , a saltwater user in Fullerton , &quot; There ' s no red eyes . You can ' t taste it . Your hair doesn ' t turn green. &quot; A_few pool owners using in-line generators , however , said they did detect a mild salty taste in their water . One described it as similar to saline_solution used to clean soft contact_lenses . Kreepy Krauly recommends a salt level of 2 # 500 ppm : a teardrop is three times as salty as that . Golden West Pool ' s Kim Martin views the slightly elevated salt levels as a bonus . &quot; They ' re great systems because the salt level in the pool is the same as your body . The pool doesn ' t pull the salts out of your body like a chlorinated pool does , so it doesn ' t dry_out your skin. &quot;</TEXT>
