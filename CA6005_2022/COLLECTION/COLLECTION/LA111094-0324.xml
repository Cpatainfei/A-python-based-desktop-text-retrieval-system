   <HEADLINE> LOCAL ELECTIONS / MEASURE A ; EL TORO AIRPORT IS APPARENT WINNER , BUT . . . ; BACKERS ARE READY FOR ACTION AFTER NARROW VICTORY . HOWEVER , THERE ' S NO GUARANTEE THAT A LAWSUIT OR PENTAGON PLANS WON ' T KILL THE PROJECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County voters have apparently cleared the runway for a new commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , but it is uncertain how soon -- if ever -- the plan will take_off . After months of inconclusive debate and competing ideas for the 4 # 700-acre base scheduled to be closed by 1999 , voters stepped_in and narrowly approved a referendum mandating that the county earmark 2 # 000 acres for an airport . With a winning margin of only 15 # 103 votes , it is still possible that the outcome could change once election officials finish counting about 48 # 000 absentee_ballots , Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney said . That process may take until next Wednesday . Convinced that Tuesday ' s result will stand , however , airport boosters left no doubt what they now expect . &quot; The public has spoken , &quot; said Newport Beach developer George Argyros , an architect of the Measure A referendum , and he expressed confidence that county supervisors will follow_through . &quot; It is incumbent upon the board to listen to what the people said and act accordingly , &quot; he said . But the future of the military base remains in limbo , and political divisions within the county appear likely to persist . One city , Lake Forest , promises to sue next week to have the measure declared illegal . The Pentagon said the vote would have no effect on what the U.S._government does with the property . County politicians also find themselves in a fix , nervous about spiting the voters but hopeful of sticking_to a planning process for the base ' s future -- a scheme that itself was forged only after months of rancor that , like Measure A , largely split Orange County between North and South . County officials said the supervisors will now have to decide what to do with the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , the official agency formed in March to establish a development plan for the base . The initiative does not require the dismantling of the agency . In addition , board_members will also have to decide whether the initiative can legally force the county to build a commercial airport at El Toro . Earlier this year , the supervisors ' own attorney advised that the planning agency is free to ignore Measure A , approved with 51.1 % of the vote . The agency is the only one recognized by the Pentagon to submit a reuse plan to the U.S._government for converting the Marine base to civilian use . It recently received $ 730 # 000 in federal funds . Supervisors will discuss the initiative ' s mandate at Tuesday ' s meeting , where members will debate several options for implementing the measure and keeping the planning process going , said Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder . One of the options calls_for the supervisors themselves to assume planning responsibilities for the Marine base , she added . Wieder , who supported Measure A , said that &quot; it ' s a little premature to say what ' s going_to happen. &quot; &quot; Is ( the county planning authority ) out of the picture now ? I can ' t say right now what ' s going_to happen , &quot; said Wieder . &quot; There will be several proposals before the board next week. &quot; * Meanwhile , a Pentagon spokesman said the U.S._government is not bound by the measure . &quot; As far as we ' re concerned , we ' re dealing only with the official reuse authority created to come_up with a reuse plan for the base , &quot; the Pentagon ' s Glenn Flood said on Wednesday . &quot; We will only consider the recommendations for development presented to us by that authority . If they ( the authority ) want an airport there , we ' ll consider it . But a law requiring an airport there is not binding on the federal government. &quot; The county agency is made_up of nine members : the five supervisors , three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake Forest . However , the initiative calls_for a 13-member advisory commission to work with federal , state and local agencies and the air cargo industry in developing a commercial airport at El Toro . The county counsel ' s memo on July 22 does not specifically address the county agency ' s future under Measure A , but it advised County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider that the agency can choose to ignore the initiative if members want . So it is possible that the county may have two agencies drafting separate development plans for El Toro . The memo said the county agency may also be disbanded upon passage of the initiative , if the agency or the supervisors decide to do that . Argyros said he is familiar_with the county counsel memo and dismissed it as self-serving . Another major sticking point is what to do about Irvine ' s and Lake Forest ' s roles in the planning process for El Toro . The councils of both cities oppose an airport there , and the supervisors will now have to decide whether the two municipalities should maintain their roles in the process . * Argyros said airport proponents were forced to put the initiative on the ballot because the current county planning authority , which includes Irvine and Lake Forest , is biased against the airport . Irvine Councilman Barry J . Hammond said supervisors &quot; have a difficult decision to make &quot; but argued that that county cannot legally disband the planning authority without the consent of the two cities , which &quot; signed off on the plan to create the planning agency. &quot; &quot; About 300 acres of the Marine base are inside the Irvine city_limits , &quot; he said . &quot; As long as this land is in our city , the county can ' t arbitrarily do things on its own . Sorry , we ' re part of the process whether anybody likes it or not. &quot; Hammond called the initiative &quot; in-your-face planning. &quot; &quot; If they try to exclude Irvine , we can zone those 300 acres for a 50-story child-care facility , &quot; he said . Jerry Patterson , city attorney for Lake Forest , said the city will file a lawsuit in Superior_Court next week to have Measure A ruled illegal . A judge rejected a previous lawsuit by the city in August on grounds that it was premature . Exit polling conducted by The Times shows support for Measure A -- which was touted by backers as a way to create jobs and improve the regional economy -- was strongest among Republicans , men and voters age 50 and older . It was also strong among voters with less than a high_school education and those with lower incomes . Liberals were split on the issue , but among conservatives , 55 % voted for it ; 52 % of the Republicans supported the measure , contrasted with 49 % of the Democrats and 48 % of independents . And while the Leisure World retirement community near the airport had voiced strong opposition to the airport because it would disrupt their quality_of_life , the poll found that countywide 60 % of those age 65 and over backed the measure . The measure was backed by 51 % of those whose income was over $ 60 # 000 , but it was stronger by two points among those with household income under $ 40 # 000 . A Breakdown on Measure A Votes Orange County voters were polled Tuesday after they cast their ballots .
