   <HEADLINE> 2ND AMENDMENT : SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE ; GUNS : SCHOLARLY RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE INTENTION TO HAVE AN ARMED CITIZENRY ; IRONICALLY , THAT COULD MAKE CONTROL EASIER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Nov . 8 Republican victory brought with it GOP vows to emasculate landmark gun laws , including the Brady bill . Even if the threats prove to be only rhetoric , this is a good time to give the Second Amendment some serious thought . This constitutional provision guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms was until recently dismissed as obsolete by academics , pundits and policy-makers . Yet on examination , the Second Amendment offers answers to today ' s gun debate that are likely to please neither pro- nor anti-gun control zealots . This point was made in a 1989 Yale Law Journal article by Sanford Levinson titled &quot; The Embarrassing Second Amendment. &quot; Although generally considered a left-leaning scholar , Levinson raised tough questions about how the Second Amendment has been wished away . Law professors who had previously ignored the subject began researching and holding conferences . There isn ' t complete agreement , but the outlines of what the Second Amendment means are now clear . Its purpose was to ensure an armed citizenry . This wasn ' t to prevent crime , or encourage hunting , or defend the country against invasion ; it was to ensure that the government didn ' t have a monopoly on force . With an armed populace , tyranny was thought unlikely . As Justice Joseph Story said , the right to keep and bear arms is &quot; the palladium of liberties of a republic. &quot; Or , as Thomas_Jefferson said , &quot; The strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last_resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government. &quot; Regardless of whether gun ownership promotes crime , the Second Amendment seriously limits gun_control -- just as the First_Amendment bars censoring crime reporting even though news_reports sometimes promote &quot; copycat &quot; crimes . And the argument from both sides about preserving &quot; legitimate sporting and hunting &quot; misses the mark : The Second Amendment isn ' t about hunting ducks . Nor are weapons that are &quot; only good for killing people &quot; exempted from the Second Amendment ' s protection ; they are at its core . The framers believed it was important for the people to have weapons that were good for killing , because they thought it essential for the populace to be able to defend itself against an oppressive government . This won ' t please either pro- or anti-gun forces . Many gun-control opponents are hunters ; they won ' t enjoy hearing that the Second Amendment is not about hunting . Nor is it a barrier to every kind of firearms regulation , any more_than the First_Amendment prohibits all regulation of speech . While the Second Amendment pretty clearly bans the sort of wholesale prohibition of firearms supported by some gun-control activists , it would n ' t prohibit reasonable regulation and licensing laws . In colonial times , all citizens were required to have arms and to present them for inspection once or twice a year . If the government could require citizens to show_up in_person for inspection , it ' s hard to argue that it can ' t require citizens to fill_out a form . The right to bear arms was always limited to the law-abiding . So similar provisions would clearly pass muster today . Gun-control advocates , meanwhile , seem especially upset by private ownership of &quot; military-style &quot; weapons . But this is what the framers meant to protect : The semi-automatic assault weapons that they most dislike would thus be protected under the Second Amendment . Of course , some say the Second Amendment is obsolete . But with armed citizens , this country has enjoyed a longer period of peace and stability than any other , while millions of citizens have been killed in this century by the authorities in European_nations often held_up as models of civilization by gun controllers . Had the millions of Jews and Gypsies annihilated by Nazis possessed weapons , their fate might have been different . Today , from Bosnia , to Cambodia , to Tian An Men Square , the enslavement or annihilation of the weak by the strong seems the rule , not the exception , and there is no reason that this country will always be immune . Could armed citizens resist a tyrannical government now ? True , modern armies have tanks and helicopters and civilians don ' t , but from Vietnam , to Lebanon , to Afghanistan , modern armies have consistently lost to armed civilians . So the role of an armed citizenry may_not be obsolete . Ironically , if we take the Second Amendment seriously it may actually make some gun_controls easier . So far ( as November ' s elections proved ) , barriers to gun_control have been political , not constitutional . And opponents have been energized by their well-founded fear that many gun-control advocates want to outlaw guns completely . If the Supreme Court explicitly recognizes the right to keep and bear arms , fear of confiscation might go_away , and reasonable regulations -- those that would disarm criminals , not honest citizens -- might fare better . What ' s missing in today ' s polarized debate is trust . Gun-control advocates portray gun owners as depraved merely because they own guns ; gun owners oppose any form of control because they see it as a step toward confiscation . Strong recognition of the right to bear arms might heal this breach and let us do something constructive .</TEXT>
