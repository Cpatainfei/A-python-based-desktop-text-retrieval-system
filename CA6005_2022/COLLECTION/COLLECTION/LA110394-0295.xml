   <HEADLINE> JON AVNET : ON THE BRINK OF ' WAR ' ; THE DIRECTOR ' S LATEST ONCE AGAIN SHOWS HE STANDS_UP FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s a forerunner of &quot; The War &quot; you will never see . Forget for the moment the real film_starring Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner that will open Friday . Burrow back into director Jon Avnet ' s brain to a less chummy Los Angeles , one that wasn ' t toasting him for the sleeper success of his first feature_film , &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes. &quot; This was a whole other city that was braking for that ubiquitous animal -- the aggressive , ambitious New York transplant trying to break_into the film business . And while said animal , Jon Avnet , awaited the chance to pour his fantasies onto the big screen , he cultivated them in his head . And this one wasn ' t pretty . &quot; I had this fantasy , because it ' s very hard to get started in the film business , this movie where you drop 10 # 000 yellow cabs on the freeway on a rainy_day , just to watch the battles break_out and the Angelenos die of fright from horn hogs and cabbies hitting them and pushing and going_on the wrong side of the road and rioting through the dividers , because it was like this placid culture , and all these people who speak a different brand of English . What a great movie it would have been. &quot; Jon Avnet , 44 , is still in fine fighting form . He is slouched in a leather chair in his Culver City office in his hot , newish director ' s best -- black leather jacket , slicked-back hair , jeans and gym_shoes . * A constant surge of high energy will keep a leg in motion for the next 2 1 / 2 hours . He is talking_about his flourishing aggressive side that has , at least in some regard , served him well . The charm of bulldozing through obstacles propelled him along the difficult five-year path to making &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes. &quot; &quot; I ' m said ' no ' to all_the time and I ' m excited when people say ' no ' to me , &quot; says Avnet . &quot; It gets me up_on Monday even. &quot; Perhaps even more useful , it got him down the last official stretch of his rocky road from producer to director . And now comes his latest film , &quot; The War , &quot; a prose_poem on aggression and a heart-tugging morality tale of its pitfalls . The duality is there because Avnet , the Brooklyn boy who resurrected the Southern film genre , is the Janus of directors -- with every hard-edged Avnet yang , there is a tender , emotional yin . &quot; Jon , when you don ' t know him , can come_off as being a little arrogant and a little bit of a know-it-all and a little insensitive , &quot; says longtime friend and former producing partner Steve Tisch . &quot; But that is a very thin surface , and beneath that surface there ' s a very deeply sensitive man who has found a venue to express his deep , deep feelings. &quot; &quot; The War &quot; traces the early 1970s aftermath of Vietnam in the fractured life of a returning war veteran played by Costner . There ' s also a parallel and metaphorical war between his kids , played by Elijah Wood and Lexi Randall , and the Lipnickis , a poverty-stricken family who battle them for a junk-filled treehouse nestled in an 800-year-old palace of an angel oak . Ultimately , the only battle won is the Costner character ' s lesson that all_of it is futile . &quot; My daddy said , ' Instead of fighting , we were meant for better things , you and I , ' &quot; says Randall , who narrates the film . &quot; No matter how much people understand war , war don ' t understand people. &quot; As in &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes , &quot; the Deep_South is virtually a character in &quot; The War. &quot; The $ 13-million &quot; Tomatoes , &quot; despite generally lackluster reviews , benefited from tasty word_of_mouth . It lingered for months in theaters , grossing $ 82 million in the U.S. And Avnet was catapulted onto the A-list of directors who could attract sterling talent , not only Costner for &quot; The War , &quot; but also Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer for his next film , &quot; Up Close and Personal , &quot; which begins shooting in March . And despite the title of &quot; The War , &quot; which would seem to hold commercial promise as an action film , the $ 18-million movie , in fact , trades little on that Hollywood commodity . &quot; I think_of it as similar to ' To Kill a Mockingbird , ' &quot; Avnet says . &quot; One of the things that attracted me to this movie was it seemed idyllic , this world of dirt-poor people . The town this was based on in 1970 had a population of approximately 25 # 000 people , and 22 # 000 of them earned less than $ 3 # 000 a year . &quot; But what they were fighting over seems idyllic compared to what we see every day on television or read in the papers , which is carnage -- carnage far in excess to what happened in Vietnam . . . . I just wonder whether the child has been taken_out of childhood. &quot; Avnet says that casting and directing the baker ' s dozen of children was the most challenging part of making &quot; The War. &quot; What ' s more , only the two leads , Wood and Randall , were professionals . &quot; I really have a problem with kids who do commercials , &quot; Avnet says , &quot; because they look_like they ' re selling a product . They have these shiny little faces. &quot; Of course , directing untrained child actors posed other problems as well , but Avnet found a handy tool in stunt camp -- or rather , the threat of no stunt camp . The camp was called to get the kids in shape for the battles around the treehouse and a water_tower . ( The trickiest stunts were performed by grown-up professionals -- really short ones. ) Wood says that Avnet , who lives_in Topanga Canyon with his artist wife , Barbara Brody , and three children , was deft in dealing with his young cast . &quot; I think he ' s excellent with kids because he ' s got kids of_his_own , &quot; Wood says . &quot; We all treat him like a dad , that ' s how cool_it was . At the end of the film , he was like , ' If you ever need help in acting , I can help you , ' or ' If you need help in regular life , I can help you also. ' &quot; Universal was equally pleased with the top-billed Wood -- enough to fashion an Oscar campaign around him which would , if successful , make the 13-year-old the youngest best actor ever . Costner reportedly agreed to be submitted as a best supporting contender to boost Wood ' s chances . And Avnet soft-pedaled buzz that Costner butted heads with him over the actor ' s limited profile in the movie . &quot; Kevin looked_at the movie in an early version and looked_at it in a later version , and his ideas had to do with the movie , not just with himself , &quot; Avnet says . What is not in_dispute is that working with the sometimes obstreperous kids of &quot; The War &quot; touched_on something that persists_in Avnet ' s own psyche . &quot; I was the first_person in the principal ' s office , and actually somebody said that kids are punished for the exact qualities that adults are rewarded for , and I was thinking , ' that ' s my autobiography. ' I ' m stubborn . I come_up with things that no one else would think to do . These are the qualities that hopefully infuse the films I ' ve done. &quot; Avnet was born &quot; in Gil Hodges ' mitt , &quot; as his mother liked to say , declining credit for the job in favor of the erstwhile first_baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers . When he was 5 , the family moved to Great Neck , Long_Island , where his father , Lester , and grandfather built an electronics distribution company . But Lester ' s heart lay_in the arts , and family lore has it that he turned_down a job playing violin in the Warner Bros . orchestra in Los Angeles in the early ' 40s because he couldn ' t afford to relocate Avnet ' s mother , Joan . &quot; I think I ' m playing the violin for him to some extent , &quot; Avnet says . Avnet attended Sarah Lawrence College as one of the first men to integrate the women ' s school , gaining a ringside opportunity to explore his empathy with the other sex . And that trait later formed the foundation of his &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes , &quot; which celebrates women ' s friendships , and &quot; The Burning Bed , &quot; the award-winning TV movie on spouse abuse that netted Farrah Fawcett stripes as a serious actress . Avnet got a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater and film , where he made an expressionistic film with an unknown actor named Richard Gere . It got him into the directing program at the American Film Institute in 1972 . Avnet never finished , though , leaving in disillusionment after his protests of a dean ' s firing led to naught . Avnet ' s early jobs in the business weren ' t any more gratifying . He worked for a while as an assistant to producers Fred Weintraub and Paul Heller , but ended_up being fired . He says he was hired &quot; ostensibly to direct films , but after 2 1 / 2 years of bondage , it wasn ' t going_to happen and I was pissed off. &quot; But Avnet , then only in his mid-20s , had learned something useful about his temperament and his calling . &quot; I imitated Vivien Leigh from ' Gone With the Wind ' when she said she was never going_to be poor again . I didn ' t want to be at the mercy of anybody for my directing , because it just meant too_much to me . And I was headstrong and too sensitive and too vulnerable and just generally ridiculously immature , but very energetic. &quot; He decided to enter the field as a producer , and when he had substantial control , move_over into directing . In late 1977 , Avnet hooked_up_with family friend Steve Tisch . They had worked together on ' 77 ' s &quot; Outlaw Blues &quot; for Warner Bros . when Avnet was still with Weintraub-Heller Productions . Soon after , they launched a seven-year partnership that produced a spate of work for television and theatrical release that included &quot; The Burning Bed. &quot; &quot; I think Jon had a tendency with most of the directors he worked with of co-directing , &quot; says his current producing partner , Jordan Kerner . &quot; For him it was sometimes frustrating if he knew he could get this or that performance , and ultimately there was that imperative creatively as an artist &quot; to move_into directing . When Avnet decided he needed to pull_back from producing and pour his energies into directing , he and Tisch ended their seven-year partnership . But they remain close -- they still work down the hall from each other in a jointly owned office_building and they share stakes in real_estate deals and the Hard Rock Cafe . In 1986 , Avnet joined forces with Kerner . Over the years , their company has had a critically uneven but mostly commercially successful track record with such films as &quot; Less Than Zero &quot; ( 1987 ) , &quot; Men Don ' t Leave &quot; ( 1990 ) , &quot; The Mighty Ducks &quot; ( 1992 ) , &quot; Three Musketeers &quot; ( 1993 ) and &quot; When a Man Loves a Woman &quot; ( 1994 ) . A new Avnet / Kerner romantic comedy opens in January , &quot; Miami Rhapsody , &quot; directed by David Frankel and starring Sarah Jessica Parker , Mia Farrow and Antonio Banderas . With &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes &quot; ( 1991 ) , Avnet finally left most of the producing at Avnet / Kerner to Kerner . Helping Avnet make the shift from producing to directing were his longtime mentor , Universal chairman Tom Pollock , and Norman Lear , who executive produced &quot; Tomatoes &quot; and shared a background in television . &quot; I was inclined to support him because he had such a passion for making that story , &quot; Lear says . &quot; And his background in TV suggested that between he and Jordan , they knew how to make a film and bring it in on budget. &quot; &quot; Tomatoes &quot; did have its worms , however . After press kits and posters had gone_out naming Avnet and &quot; Tomatoes &quot; novelist Fannie Flagg as the screenwriters , the Writers Guild stripped Avnet of his credit and gave it to Carol Sobieski , who had died at 51 after writing earlier drafts . Avnet still bristles_at the mention of that arbitration . &quot; I think ( the Writers Guild is ) changing the bias against directors and producers , which came_about for a very good reason . And I ' m not arguing against it , but there ' s something categorically absurd when you write the vast majority of something to say to someone they don ' t have a credit writing it . It ' s just bizarre. &quot; The other controversy turned_on a charge by gay organizations and some critics that Avnet had whitewashed the book ' s implied lesbian relationship between the characters played by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker . &quot; What I actually wanted to explore was a very intimate relationship between two women . And I found it just fascinating that the feelings were so vehement that it had to be one way or another , as if they owned it : ' How dare you ? ' &quot; Part of this ( politically correct ) world we ' re in is you ' ve got_to fit some mold or you ' re a bad boy . You know I ain ' t going_to take that from them any more_than I ' m going_to take it from the stupid far right people who tell you you can ' t have an abortion. &quot; In fact , social concerns lace many of Avnet ' s projects , from &quot; The Burning Bed &quot; to the &quot; The War , &quot; which maintains Avnet ' s youthful despair over the futility of Vietnam , but reflects a sympathy for its veterans that surfaced as Avnet matured . Avnet is also in pre-production on a miniseries for Turner Broadcasting and ABC about Nelson Mandela ' s life and the rise and fall of South_African apartheid , which will star Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte . The project was so hard to sell that it has taken seven years to get_off_the_ground . While Avnet has managed the tricky feat of melding social issues with commercial clout , he knows it ' s a delicate balancing act . And on this blazingly perfect day in Los Angeles , he is wondering whether &quot; The War &quot; will attract the sort of audiences and numbers that have allowed him to pursue his sometimes unlikely projects . &quot; I hope it has enough so that the people who spend money on movies will want to make another one like it , whether it be mine or Quentin Tarantino ' s or someone who does something that ' s different . . . from just genre films , that are only entertaining or exploitative , films that are violent for the purpose of making money , which I find repugnant . &quot; People have voices that don ' t get an opportunity to make movies , that may have something that would be affecting and help us laugh and understand differences and come_to understanding . That would be a great thing , I think . So I hope that it hits a chord in people. &quot;</TEXT>
