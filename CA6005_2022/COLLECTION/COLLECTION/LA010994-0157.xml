   <HEADLINE> SPRAYING AWAY GARDEN PESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Winter spraying is what is know as preventive_medicine for the garden . The enemy is usually hidden or just fast_asleep . Who are these enemies ? They are some of the worst pests such_as mites , scale , some species of aphids , rose mildew and especially the fungus that causes peach leaf curl , which can only be controlled by spraying . The keystone to success is thorough spraying with the correct product . Anything less means a wasted program . Spray from the bottom up , including the undersides of limbs . Avoid spraying during the heat of the day as this will help decrease the evaporation of the spray and don ' t spray on windy days to avoid and minimize drift . Always mix the solution as recommended by the manufacturer .</TEXT>
