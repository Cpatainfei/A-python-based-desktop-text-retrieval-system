   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER ; GETTING IT RIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You only have to be exposed to it for a little while to realize that Norwegian is not an easy language to pick_up . It is_full of sounds and inflections that trip enchantingly off the tongues of those who grew_up with it , but merely trip_up the unwary foreigner trying to make a good impression . Actually , foreigners here are spoiled , because most Norwegians speak English and many speak another language as well , often German . Still , there are place_names that really can ' t be said in other tongues , so when you ' re asking directions , it pays to say them right . And for those of you watching the Games at_home , eager to impress your friends by dropping the names of the various venues into your Olympic conversations , here ' s a little pronunciation guide : -- Lillehammer : It ' s LIL-uh-hom-mer , not Lily-hammer . It means little crag , to distinguish it from another similar sounding place nearby . -- Hamar : This is the similar sounding place nearby . The speedskating and figure_skating will be held_in HOM-ar , which used to be Storhamar / Hamar , or big crag . The differences in spelling and pronunciation of the two craggy places are not explained , simply accepted . -- Hunderfossen : The luge-bobsled run is at Hunderfossen , which sounds pretty much the way it looks , HOON-der-faw-sen . -- Hafjell : The thing to remember is that in Norwegian , J sounds like Y . Thus , the site of some of the Alpine skiing is HOF-yell . -- Kvitfjell : The F in the middle is merely there to confuse and there apparently is local_option on the V . Some say it like a W , some like a V , so the site of the rest of the Alpine skiing is either KWEET-yell or Ka-VEET-yell . -- Gjovik : Now here is an interesting word . The G-J combination is common in Norwegian but does not translate well , since the G is hinted at , rather than pronounced . And this particular O isn ' t really an O , since in Norwegian it has a slash through it , which gives it kind of an uhr sound . So if you say -- if you can say -- YEE-uhr-vik , people will probably know you ' re talking_about one of the hockey sites . -- Lysgardsbakkene : There is no way most Americans are going_to do_justice to the name of the ski-jumping arena , but it sounds like Liss-gorsh-BAH-kuh-neh . The Norwegians also say , Adjo , which means , See you later . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
