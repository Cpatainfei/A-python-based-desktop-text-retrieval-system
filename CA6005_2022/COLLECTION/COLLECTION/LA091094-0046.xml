   <HEADLINE> U.S. TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Todd Carrell ' s views ( Commentary , Sept . 1 ) on the limits to U.S. missionary and capitalist zeal in China are the most sensible to appear in The Times for many moons . He identifies but does not explain the cultural thresholds across which both Chinese and Americans view and bargain with each other in a world that is rapidly filling_up . We , raised in an exaggerated secular expression of Calvinist predestination of the individual that was made affordable by the conquest of the American West , protect the person at the expense of the community . The Chinese protect the community at the expense of the individual . Both systems have their excesses and costs along with their benefits ; the point is that they are and will remain different . These basic differences are reflected in many ways . In China , law and government are the same ; here we love the law and hate the government . The hierarchical Confucian model assumes trust and harmony in a cooperative system of command and control ; our free-market democracy is one where trust is an earned competitive advantage . There are many other distinctions . It seems evident to Carrell that mutual acceptance of these realities is inevitable . There is some urgency in this . I believe it will lead to cooperation that will increasingly rule over competition in a shrinking world where wars for resources and markets will be succeeded by conflicts over riparian_rights to pollute . It will be more efficient to adapt to cultural differences than to try to eliminate them . CHARLES GUNNERSON Laguna Hills * How ironic the article ( Aug . 31 ) on China and its &quot; progress in human_rights &quot; just below a photo of two leggy dress-up dolls symbolizing China ' s treatment of women . How continually ironic the U.S. policy toward Cuba , where , as opposed to China , it is still not believed that &quot; commercial engagement has a greater impact than the threat of commercial disengagement. &quot; If only we could learn from our lessons , and really live_by our ideals . GREG CHITTICK Santa Barbara * Where is Clinton ' s moral purchase for protesting Tian An Men Square when his own Administration burned hundreds of men , women and children to death in Waco , Tex. , for the even-lesser crime of following their religion ? A . E . MOSES Laguna Beach * The Clinton_Administration ' s non-policy on Cuba is a total disgrace and the epitome of hypocrisy . At the same time when Commerce_Secretary Ron Brown is dispatched to Beijing to initiate talks on increased trade with China , the largest remaining communist country and which has been granted MFN status , the Administration pretends that a small decrepit island nation in the Caribbean is still the threat that we were all led to believe it was during the Cold_War and states that further suffering by its people is the only solution to the Castro regime . In an era that has seen mortal_enemies such_as the PLO and Israel , the IRA and Britain , Mandela and De Klerk engaged in peace talks , why then does this Administration insist on continuing a 35-year-old policy that has obviously failed ? Open trade with Cuba will hasten the demise of Castro ' s government faster than any embargo will . JUAN G . SANCHEZ Downey</TEXT>
