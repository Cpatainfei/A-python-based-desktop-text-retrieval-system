   <TEXT> A Santa Paula man was arrested early Monday on suspicion of fatally shooting his brother and wounding another brother in the arm during a family gathering at their rural ranch_house . Moises Galaviz , 41 , was booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of murder and held_on $ 250 # 000 bail . He is suspected of killing his 35-year-old brother , Jose Luis Galaviz , and wounding Aurelio Galaviz , another brother of undisclosed age . Jose Galaviz was pronounced dead at the scene . Aurelio Galaviz was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital . Sheriff ' s Lt . Paul Anderson said gunfire erupted about 1:30 a.m. Monday during a quarrel over who was the supervisor at the sprawling citrus ranch where the three brothers apparently worked . &quot; There was a family argument over who was the top_banana , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; They were arguing about who ' s the boss and the guy decided to accent his point. &quot; After the shooting , sheriff ' s officials said Moises Galaviz ran_into a nearby orchard toward the Santa Clara River . Sheriff ' s officials launched an intensive manhunt , with several police_dogs , a sheriff ' s helicopter and the department ' s Special Weapons and Tactics team . About 6 a.m. , Galaviz was found in woods near the ranch and arrested without incident . He was in possession of the handgun believed to be the murder weapon , Anderson said . Galaviz had been drinking , Anderson said , but it was unclear how much . Late Monday afternoon , members of the Galaviz family sat red-eyed and sullen inside their wood-sided ranch_house surrounded by orange groves on South Mountain Road . A priest from a local church was present , making funeral arrangements for Jose Galaviz . The men ' s mother , Andrea Ornaes , visiting from Zacatecas , Mexico , was at the family gathering when the shooting took_place , a coroner ' s spokeswoman said . &quot; We don ' t have anything to say , &quot; one family member said . &quot; We don ' t want any of that publicity. &quot; The house is among a handful of residences that line South Mountain Road as it winds past the citrus ranches south of Santa Paula . It is ordinarily a quiet place to live , said Bob Smith , who lives across the street from the where the shooting occurred . &quot; You expect this kind of thing in town , &quot; Smith said . &quot; that ' s one of the reasons I live_out here . Out here you don ' t expect this kind of thing to happen. &quot; Although he doesn ' t know the family well , Smith said he was at the Galaviz residence on Sunday afternoon to ask permission to dump some brush_on their property . The party was just getting started , and Smith said he and his wife , Suzanne , were invited to stay . They declined . Later that night , Smith said he heard five or six shots , followed by a piercing scream . The police activity kept him up until about 2:30 a.m. &quot; They seemed like real nice people , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I guess things just got_out of hand. &quot;</TEXT>
