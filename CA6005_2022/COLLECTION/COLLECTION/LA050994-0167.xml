   <HEADLINE> INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT ; FITTIPALDI SAYS COCKPIT COVER WOULD HELP DRIVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Still saddened after the funeral of his close friend Ayrton Senna last Thursday in Brazil , Emerson Fittipaldi called Sunday for canopies to be added_to cockpits of open-wheel Formula One and Indy cars . &quot; Canopies , like ones used in off-shore racing_boats , should be the next safety step for these cars , &quot; he said after practice opened for the May 29 Indianapolis 500 . &quot; They could be the solution for head injuries , such_as Ayrton ' s. &quot; Fittipaldi , a two-time Formula One champion before switching to Indy cars , also criticized Formula One for its attitude toward safety . &quot; After the accident at Imola , the constructors blamed the promoters , the drivers blamed the constructors , everyone blamed someone else , &quot; he said . &quot; They should all work with one another , not point fingers at others , but that is not their way . &quot; Once , when I was racing ( Formula One ) and there was an accident where a driver was killed , I went_out the next day to the place where the accident occurred and sought some answers_for myself . Instead of asking me for some input , the FIA threatened me with suspension for looking around. &quot; As to Senna ' s crash , Fittipaldi said : &quot; The corner where he went_off is one that everyone takes flat out . There must have been mechanical failure . ( Michael ) Schumacher was right behind him , and he said Senna ' s car seemed to bottom_out and get a little out of shape before he went_off the course . &quot; Why , we don ' t know yet , but it would have helped if there had been a tire barrier in front of the cement barrier where his car hit . For sure , at such a high-speed corner there should have been more protection . &quot; I would also recommend that F1 cars increase their minimum weight . They are much too fragile . They are 250 pounds lighter than Indy cars , and around the driver there is not a lot of material to absorb an impact . Indy cars are much better protected . Because F1 cars are so fragile , it makes drivers much more vulnerable. &quot; * Scott Brayton , driving a Menard V6 modification of the old Buick stock block engines built_in his father ' s shop in Coldwater , Mich. , stunned the more highly publicized drivers with a lap of 227.658 m.p.h. Brayton reportedly had a trap speed of 243 m.p.h. on the straightaway , although he said , &quot; I saw the speedometer and never went_over 235. &quot; SHAV GLICK</TEXT>
