   <HEADLINE> COLLABORATOR TESTIFIES ON KILLINGS OF 7 JEWS ; WORLD_WAR_II : THE FIRST FRENCHMAN TRIED FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY INSISTS HE ' TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER SOLUTION. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier , his voice barely a whisper at times , testified in his defense Tuesday , giving a detailed account of the decision to execute seven Jews during World_War_II and portraying himself as a troubled functionary acting only under German orders . &quot; Right to the end , I tried to find another solution , &quot; said Touvier , 78 , the first Frenchman ever brought_to trial on charges of crimes against humanity . Shown photographs of the slain Jews , mouths and eyes wide open in death , Touvier sputtered , &quot; These photos . . . it ' s horrible. &quot; Touvier , the former intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia , has been_on trial for 10 days in a court in Versailles , where a jury of nine is deciding his fate . The maximum penalty under French law is life in prison . The trial , and the legal battle waged to bring Touvier to court after his arrest in 1989 , has renewed a painful , 50-year-old debate in France over the Vichy government ' s collaboration with the German occupation during World_War_II . Touvier , who was hidden for 45 years by right-wing Catholic priests and monks , has admitted that he handpicked the men who executed the seven Jews in Rillieux-la-Pape , near Lyons , on June 29 , 1944 . The executions were in reprisal for the assassination by Resistance fighters of the Vichy regime ' s propaganda chief , Philippe Henriot , after the D-Day landing . In earlier testimony , Touvier had claimed memory lapses . But Tuesday , he said he wanted to give a full account of the events leading_up to the executions . He said he had just returned to Lyons from Vichy on June 28 , 1944 , when his French superior , Victor de Bourmont , told him of Henriot ' s death and of the decision by Lyons Gestapo chief Werner Knab to respond with &quot; a spectacular execution of 100 Jews. &quot; &quot; De Bourmont was panic-stricken , and I was panic-stricken too , &quot; Touvier testified , noting that an agreement then was struck , cutting the number of Jews to be executed . &quot; We tried to reduce the number of victims from 30 , &quot; he said . &quot; I said we would do seven at a time. &quot; Touvier said Knab became preoccupied with other matters and didn ' t notice the change in number . Touvier ' s aide , Albert Reynaud , chose the seven prisoners , he testified . &quot; We could not avoid the catastrophe , &quot; Touvier had testified earlier . &quot; But I did , even so , save 23 human lives. &quot; That is the crux of Touvier ' s defense : that he was following German orders and that , by his actions , some lives were saved . The seven refugees , ages 23 to 64 , were lined_up against the wall of a cemetery in Rillieux and shot one by one , first in the back , then in the head . &quot; It had been decided . It had been done , &quot; Touvier said . After the executions , &quot; I spent a very bad night , &quot; he testified . And the next day , he said , he saw a Jesuit priest and confessed . &quot; I never forgot this tragedy , &quot; he testified . &quot; I said Mass . Mass for Jews is valid. &quot; Touvier ' s fate rests in large part on whether the jury decides that the executions fall_under the legal definition of a crime against humanity , which is a crime willingly carried_out as a deliberate policy of genocide . And a key question is whether the Vichy regime had , on its own , a policy of genocide . Robert Paxton , a historian at Columbia University in New York and author of two acclaimed books on France under the occupation , testified Monday that the Vichy government &quot; adopted a policy of exclusion of the Jews from the economy and culture , for its own reasons and not to please the Germans. &quot; Paxton argued that in 1942 , when the Vichy government turned Jewish refugees in unoccupied zones over to the Germans , &quot; the_French services became accomplices in the ' final solution.
