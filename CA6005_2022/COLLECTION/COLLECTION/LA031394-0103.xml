   <HEADLINE> DESIGNS ON SURVIVAL ; DESPITE A DOWNTURN IN THE INDUSTRY , INTERIOR_DESIGNERS ARE STREAMLINING AND SPECIALIZING SERVICES TO STAY IN BUSINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Interior_designer Ivan Beardsley , called_upon to lecture at a colleague ' s home on a cool fall night 18 months ago , looked_to his audience and caught_a_glimpse of the future . Instead of half_a_dozen or so beginning designers , Beardsley faced nearly 40 stellar industry professionals who had come_to hear his talk on how to survive the 1990s . Like a hungry press corps , they besieged Beardsley with so many questions that his planned 45-minute lecture became a three-hour session on designer woes , ranging from marketing and billing problems to shrinking demand and decorating budgets . &quot; I was beside myself , &quot; recalled Beardsley , a Silver Lake designer with nearly two decades ' experience and a past president of the American Society of Interior_Designers . &quot; I was prepared to talk to six to eight people. &quot; Since that lecture -- his first -- two things have happened : Beardsley ' s advice has become so in-demand that he now addresses interior_designers several times a year . And Southern California ' s recession , thought then to have perhaps bottomed_out , has grown steadily worse , making things yet more perilous for interior_designers . Of all_the high-ticket industries to nose-dive in the grim ' 90s , West Los Angeles ' residential interior_design business has taken a particularly nasty crash . Once awash in the capital of a thriving regional economy , Westside designers now are in the midst of a shakeout that has left them scrambling for customers , discounting prices and developing narrower and narrower specialties to woo their remaining customers . And those are the lucky ones . The unlucky ones have simply closed_shop and moved_on . &quot; We ' re having an industry fallout , &quot; said Beardsley . &quot; Everyone ' s gearing down on their products , on their prices and on their real estate. &quot; The upheaval has been as sudden and overwhelming as a brush_fire , affecting a_few designers at first before spreading quickly throughout the industry . Indeed , it wasn ' t that long ago that interior_designers on the Westside were blithely passing_on projects that weren ' t large enough for their tastes . In the age of affluence of a mere five years ago , a $ 100 # 000 budget_for a single residential project wasn ' t considered unusual at all . &quot; People were buying incredible homes and putting tremendous budgets into redecorating , &quot; said Bobbie Everts , owner of Designer Previews in Marina del Rey , a firm that represents interior_designers and architects . &quot; They were spending_money like they were printing it. &quot; Now Everts ' customers are willing to part_with only a fraction of that . In her last three jobs , the biggest interior_design budget amounted to $ 20 # 000 . &quot; People have to put bread on the table before they put fabric on their walls , &quot; she said . The physical and spiritual base for the local design industry -- the area in and around the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood -- reflects that economic shock . Overall occupancy_rates hover between 70 % and 75 % at the 16-acre center , regarded_as one of the major design centers nationwide and the premier such facility in the West . The center , built_in 1975 , recently had to have its mortgage renegotiated after the partnership that runs it , the San Francisco-based Catellus Development Corp. , fell_behind on payments . &quot; ( This ) is a world-class facility that needs to regenerate momentum about its mission , &quot; said center president Andrew Wolf , who was hired in January to rejuvenate the center . The downturn also has triggered wholesale changes in the way designers do business . Perhaps the biggest turnaround is how designers offer , and charge for , their services . Instead of purchasing furniture and accessories from showrooms , and then billing clients for their time and the merchandise , more designers are charging strictly for consulting and letting their clients pick_up their own goods . Though hiring a design consultant can cost between $ 75 and $ 200 an hour , those are still much more affordable sums to customers who might have anticipated spending tens of thousands of dollars in one designing fell swoop . &quot; We ' re charging for our creativity and design services rather than for providing a sofa , &quot; said BJ Peterson , a West Los Angeles designer and national president of the 33 # 000-member American Society of Interior_Designers . &quot; The designer is being paid_for being a designer. &quot; Some interior_designers are also narrowing their focus in hopes of capturing a particular type of client . One burgeoning specialty in residential interior_design is environmental design , in which some designers offer allergy-free environments or interiors that use only recyclable and nontoxic materials . &quot; We ' re not into the ' build your castle ' aesthetic , &quot; said Alison Pollack , a West Hills environmental interior_designer who recently launched her own firm called Earth Friendly . Despite the grim outlook in the rest of the interior_design industry , Pollack says that so far the response to her business has been very encouraging . &quot; You can ' t put a price on clean air , &quot; she said . Likewise , because of a confluence of social and economic factors , the home_office interiors trade is booming . Fifteen years ago , Douglass Hiatt , a Beverly Hills-based interior_designer , became one of the country ' s first designers to begin creating such offices . Today , said Hiatt , advances in communications technology , combined with the conflicting goals of working longer but maintaining a high_quality of life , have prompted more people than ever to seek_out spaces in their homes_in which to work . &quot; Almost every one of our clients now includes for himself a home_office , &quot; said Hiatt , whose services can command upward of $ 100 # 000 . Still , he said , it can be psychologically easier for people to justify an expensive design project that can be considered functional , rather than merely decorative . Psychology , say designers , also explains why some people who can afford it are no longer blowing big budgets on interior furnishings . Though their clients may be relatively unaffected by the recession , designers and industry observers say many customers continue to be apprehensive about the future -- and concerned that conspicuous_consumption in lean times would be politically incorrect . &quot; There ' s a weariness I call , ' compassion fatigue , ' &quot; said Wolf , the Pacific Design Center president . &quot; You ' re very aware of being ostentatious. &quot; The result has been a boon for retail design and furniture shops , as opposed to the &quot; for the trade only &quot; stores that allow only accredited designers to purchase goods . Along Venice Boulevard , dozens of home interior_design shops in the vicinity of the Antique Guild , the former Helms Bakery , are attracting a steady stream of weekend shoppers looking_for less expensive ways to decorate their homes . Steve Melendrez , manager of Civilization , a home furnishings and accessories store located near the Guild , says that while the shop ' s customers usually are well-heeled , they are drawn by the combination of cutting-edge styles at prices that are typically 30 % cheaper than list_price . The success of retail outlets has not been lost on &quot; for the trade only &quot; shops , some of which have adapted to the changing times . Though interior_designers and store proprietors are hesitant to admit it , given the tough economy , more stores than ever are likely to waive the &quot; for the trade only &quot; rule and allow the public to buy under certain conditions -- if the purchase is large enough , for instance . &quot; People who want to make a substantial investment , well , someone ' s going_to sell to them , &quot; Beardsley said . The goal of reaching_out to a larger customer base , and making interior_design more consumer-friendly , is also prompting changes at the Pacific Design Center , which is now in the midst of preparing_for Westweek , an annual trade show . The three-day_event , scheduled to start March 23 , is expected to draw 30 # 000 people . Acknowledging that the center has suffered from an aloof and &quot; off-putting &quot; reputation , Wolf envisions broadening the center ' s purview to encompass all aspects of design -- and attracting more visitors in the process . Some of the items on his agenda : opening a museum shop , attracting a major school of design to the building , showcasing the city ' s up-and-coming designers , and eventually turning the center into a visitor attraction . Echoing a sentiment heard increasingly in the design community , center executives also say they are targeting a new client base : members of the upper middle_class who may have never used a designer before but who can now afford their services -- and may have become more attuned to design in the status-conscious ' 80s . &quot; A center is more_than just a trade mart , &quot; said Wolf . &quot; I want people to leave aware that everything in the planned environment is the ' D ' word. &quot; Yet some wonder whether making high design available to upper-middle- , and possibly even middle-income consumers , can give the industry a significant economic boost . Even when showrooms in the Design Center hold an open-to-the-public demo sale of their furniture -- with goods and accessories discounted as much as 75 % -- such prices still may_not prove alluring when the item in_question is a $ 12 # 000 leather sectional or a $ 1 # 200 cocktail_table . &quot; The public that buys retail can ' t afford this furniture , anyway , &quot; said Beardsley . &quot; That segment of the market isn ' t the segment that uses designers . They aren ' t even buying on a markdown basis. &quot; Everts adds : &quot; The designers are cutting their prices but furniture costs what it costs . Ten thousand dollars is still not going_to get your home decorated. &quot; Moreover , designers say , even if trade showrooms were to open_to the public and clients ended_up buying all their own furnishings , customers still lack the creative vision to put_together an interior_design scheme . In a practice where one fatal design choice could cost thousands of dollars to rectify , many people remain intimidated by the decorating process . Indeed , at Civilization , store manager Melendrez says not as_many customers are coming_in by themselves anymore . &quot; I see more and more designers bringing their clients in , &quot; he said . &quot; You never saw that before. &quot; Such reports , though , will likely bring small comfort to those designers struggling to weather the recession . Beardsley said one recent survey he conducted of his colleagues found that more_than 40 % were forced to make changes in their business to survive , while another 16 % were contemplating leaving the business altogether . It ' s a refrain heard often by Everts , who represents nearly 50 interior_designers and about a dozen architects . Everts , who is married , considers herself lucky because she is not her family ' s only bread-winner . &quot; I don ' t see it getting better at all this year and I don ' t see it getting_better next year , &quot; said Everts , who on the advice of her accountant husband moved_out of her pricey Marina del Rey office to work_at home , just before the industry turned southward . &quot; If I had to depend_on this to live , I would be scared out of my mind. &quot; On the Cover Andrew Wolf , president of the Pacific Design Center , was hired in January to rejuvenate the facility . The West Hollywood center , built_in 1975 , serves as a base for the local design industry and is one of the country ' s premier design outlets .</TEXT>
