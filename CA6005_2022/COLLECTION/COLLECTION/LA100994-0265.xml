   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SECRETARY OF STATE ; CANDIDATES DIFFER SHARPLY ON EXTENT OF VOTER FRAUD ; REPUBLICAN BILL JONES SAYS UP TO 15 % OF THOSE ON CALIFORNIA ROLLS DO NOT BELONG THERE . DEMOCRAT MILLER SAYS THOSE CHARGES ARE EXAGGERATED . BOTH MEN STRUGGLE TO ATTRACT ATTENTION TO THEIR CAMPAIGNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At first glance , the two leading candidates for secretary_of_state in the Nov . 8 election have much in common : Both are political unknowns in their mid-40s from the Central Valley who are scrambling for scarce campaign dollars and name recognition . Both even attend Baptist_churches . Look closer and the similarities vanish . Democrat Tony Miller , 46 , the acting secretary_of_state , is a sophisticated Berkeley-trained lawyer , a career administrator and the first openly gay candidate to run_for a statewide office anywhere in the country . After 18 years as legal counsel and top deputy in the secretary_of_state ' s office , he is in his first run_for elected office . Claiming a lack of political experience , he describes himself as a non-politician and the best- qualified candidate for the job . Republican Bill Jones , 44 , is a 12-year assemblyman and onetime GOP leader who speaks with a slight drawl and spends weekends helping run his family ' s farming business in Fresno County . As a legislator , he has been one of agriculture ' s best_friends and a staunch opponent of environmentalists . More important to his campaign , he is also the author of the &quot; three strikes &quot; criminal sentencing measure that was signed into law this year , increasing penalties for a third felony to 25 years to life . The two candidates clash most over the issue of election_fraud . If you listen to Jones , the voting rolls have been tainted by the inclusion of untold numbers of illegal immigrants and deceased voters . Nothing short of an overhaul in registration and voting procedures -- even requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls -- can prevent elections theft in California . But Miller scoffs at Jones ' charges as exaggerated and his solutions as excessive . If there is fraud , Miller says , it should be rooted_out , but he finds no evidence that it is widespread . However , it is mainly an argument going_on in a vacuum . With little money for advertising , both candidates face the daunting task of attracting voters ' attention . To raise his visibility , Jones relies heavily on his claim to &quot; three strikes &quot; fame . On the campaign trail , he brings it up at every opportunity . Miller has tried to neutralize the issue by reminding voters that he is a recent crime victim -- he was robbed at gunpoint at a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles in January -- and by endorsing the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative on the November ballot , which is identical to the Jones ' bill . However , the job that the two are fighting for has little to do with prison_terms meted_out to repeat criminals . California ' s secretary_of_state coordinates elections , maintains campaign and lobbyist filings , publishes the statewide ballot pamphlet , files a variety of corporate records and is a member of the state ' s World Trade Commission . Jones says the &quot; three strikes &quot; measure is relevant because it shows that he can get things done if elected . Despite his genial , down-home demeanor , Jones is proving to be an aggressive campaigner , aiming his voter fraud charges squarely at Miller and Miller ' s former boss , longtime Secretary_of_State March Fong Eu . He contends that as_many as 15 % of all voters on the rolls in the state do not belong there -- that they are duplicate filings , non-citizens or dead . Miller responds : &quot; There just hasn ' t been wholesale fraud ( in California ) . You can find abuses and use them to try to prove the whole system has been corrupted . that ' s simply not the case. &quot; Jones likes to point_out that Mario Aburto Martinez , a Mexican citizen and the accused killer of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , was registered to vote_in San Pedro . What Jones does not volunteer is that Martinez never voted and was dropped from the Los Angeles County voter rolls as part of a routine address check , before the assassination . However , local election officials do confirm several examples of non-citizens registering and casting ballots . Miller asserts that many of these instances are the result of misinformation on the part of non-citizens who are encouraged to sign_up by bounty hunters who are paid according to the number of people they register . Miller also notes that Jones voted for a 1992 measure that allows welfare applicants to use voter registration records as proof of residence to qualify for grants -- an incentive for non-citizens to register . &quot; The most effective thing is an effective anti-voter fraud unit , &quot; Miller said , referring to a small team of investigators he formed this year . Jones counters that the unit was long overdue and put_in place as a result of his raising the issue . Both candidates advocate limits on campaign contributions . Jones supports reimposing contribution limits imposed by voters in 1988 when they approved Proposition 73 , which was struck_down in court . Miller goes further . He also wants to put caps on what candidates and their committees are allowed to spend . And he has called_for an end to the common practice of soliciting lobbyists for political contributions . Miller has voluntarily signed a California Common Cause pledge not to ask lobbyists for campaign money . Jones has refused to do so -- and several Capitol lobbyists showed_up at a recent Jones fund-raiser . Like most Democrats , Miller is an enthusiastic supporter of the federal &quot; motor voter &quot; statute , which requires states to begin registering voters when they apply for driver ' s licenses or other state services . Jones pledges to implement the new law , but his fellow Republican , Gov . Pete Wilson , has ordered state officials not to start_up the new registration system Jan . 1 unless the federal_government provides the money to run it . Miller leaves no doubt what he will do if Wilson is reelected and refuses to comply : &quot; If Pete Wilson is governor , on Jan . 2 of 1995 . . . if I am secretary_of_state , he will find himself in court on that afternoon. &quot; Jones has attacked his rival for reducing or forgiving millions of dollars in fines for those late in filing campaign and lobbyist disclosure statements . Miller says he has been evenhanded , forgiving and reducing fines regardless of party affiliation except where violations are shown to be willful . Miller was raised in the Northern California lumber town of Chester , where his father worked_at the sawmill . The candidate lives on a small farm in the Central Valley , where he and his partner raise nuts and other crops . Miller went_off to UC Davis and then Boalt Hall , the law_school at UC Berkeley . He was one of the original members of the state Fair Political Practices Commission . In 1976 , he went_to work for Eu as chief counsel in the secretary_of_state ' s office , later becoming her top deputy . Eu ' s campaign treasury is Miller ' s biggest contributor . Jones was born_on his father ' s ranch near Coalinga , Calif . He graduated from Cal State Fresno , where he was student body president . He lost in his first run_for the Assembly in 1976 . But he says he learned a lesson : When he ran again six years later , he hired the winner ' s campaign consultant . In 1991 , he became the Assembly ' s Republican leader in a revolt against the &quot; cavemen , &quot; conservative legislators who had run the GOP caucus for seven years . He stepped_down the next year after Republicans lost two Assembly seats under his leadership . Also in the race are third-party candidates Peggy Christensen , Libertarian ; Israel Feuer , Peace and Freedom ; Margaret Garcia , Green , and Dorothy Kreiss Robbins , American Independent .</TEXT>
