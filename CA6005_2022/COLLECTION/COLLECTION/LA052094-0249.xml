   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : HOPKINS JOINS OTHERS BEHIND CAMERA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What do you do when you ' ve become one of the most successful actors of your generation ? If you ' re Anthony Hopkins , you follow the lead of Kevin Costner , Mel Gibson , Warren Beatty and others and move behind the camera . Hopkins made a brief swing through Cannes on Thursday to announce that he will direct and star in &quot; August , &quot; which he describes as a &quot; funny , sad , tragic love story. &quot; The $ 5.5-million movie , set_in northern Wales , is being produced by two British companies , Majestic Films and Granada Film . Hopkins said he ' s wanted to direct for years , but only recently found the type of story he was interested in telling -- a combination of two works by Anton Chekhov , &quot; The Wood Demon &quot; and &quot; Uncle Vanya. &quot; The Academy Award-winning actor called &quot; getting the deal down on paper &quot; the hardest part of the job so far . To help move things along , sources said , Hopkins agreed to work for &quot; slightly less &quot; than his usual acting fee . &quot; August &quot; doesn ' t have an American distributor yet . With Hopkins behind and in front of the camera , however , that ' s not likely to be a problem . At a time when making films is an increasingly costly venture , many actors have moved_into directing and formed their own production companies to gain more control of the creative process . Hopkins plans to return to acting full time next year , but he says he also wants to keep his hand in directing . &quot; The challenge for me is to prove to myself that I can do something creative without all_the Sturm und Drang you see with some of the maniacs on these films , &quot; said the actor , who was too polite to name names . Sitting near poolside at the Carlton Hotel on a brilliantly sunny afternoon , where he somehow managed to avoid the kind of riot scene that envelopes most celebrities here , Hopkins said he would ultimately like to direct a big Hollywood movie . &quot; I know it ' s going_to happen , &quot; he said . * At Cannes , you never die . You just come_back with fresh hope and money . Director Peter Bogdanovich on Thursday became the latest Lazarus here when he announced the formation of a production company with philanthropist Laura Pels , who has committed to financing eight movies . Laura Pels / Peter Bogdanovich Pictures Corp . projects include &quot; Protect and Defend , &quot; based on the political potboiler by Jack Valenti , president of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America . Valenti , who will act_as a technical adviser on the film , is said to have received $ 500 # 000 for the rights to the book . Earlier in the festival , director Roman Polanski took center stage in two incarnations . He starred in the festival ' s &quot; A Simple Formality &quot; and vigorously promoted the soon-to-be completed &quot; Death and the Maiden , &quot; which is touted as his most commercial directorial work in years . Polanski said he wants to pick_up the pace of his career , because &quot; I have less and less time. &quot; One of the producers of &quot; Death and the Maiden &quot; is Thom Mount , a Hollywood veteran who has also been out of the spotlight . Emerging as the biggest comeback kid-in-waiting here is Mike Medavoy . The former TriStar Pictures chairman , who ' s expected to go_into business with CineVisions chief Peter Hoffman , made no formal announcements , but he appeared at practically every major festival party and was said to be in deal talks . Then there ' s the mother of all comebacks , the one staged by Menahem Golan and Yorum Globus , the former Cannon Pictures chiefs who split bitterly five years ago . This week , the Israeli cousins announced they ' re baaaaack . Golan and Globus , who redefined the art of self-promotion and the role of independent producers at Cannes in the 1980s , have formed International Dynamic Pictures . &quot; For five years there was a feeling of betrayal between us , &quot; Golan said . &quot; But now we are_on the verge of a new beginning. &quot; IDP was started with $ 8 million from private investors . Golan said further financing is being raised through pre-selling rights to their productions . Time hasn ' t dulled the controversial cousins ' promotional flare . Among the upcoming films touted in their brochure is &quot; On Dangerous Ground , &quot; which contains the tag_line &quot; The Heidi Fleiss Scandal . . . Now , the movie. &quot; * In his bright yellow pants and busy tie , Lloyd Kaufman looks a lot like one of his films -- loud and a little over the top . But the chairman of Troma Inc. -- think_of &quot; The Toxic Avenger &quot; and &quot; Surf Nazis Must Die &quot; -- has gained the respect of the industry by creating a loyal cult audience for his B-movies . Troma , founded by Kaufman and Michael Herz after they graduated from Yale , is celebrating its 20th anniversary at this year ' s festival with new offerings such_as &quot; Sgt . Kabukiman , N.Y.P.D. , &quot; &quot; Femme Fontaine , Killer Babe for the C.I.A. &quot; and even &quot; Nathaniel Hawthorne ' s Young Goodman Brown. &quot; The latter is part of an effort to create more serious fare . But at heart , Kaufman still resides primarily in the Roger Corman-Sam Arkoff universe of fast cars , fast guns and fast women . &quot; I must give what I have to the moviegoing public , &quot; he said . &quot; Unfortunately , I don ' t have that much to give. &quot; Self-deprecating one-liners are stock and trade for the New York-based Kaufman , who spent a frantic lunch here greeting everyone from financiers to lifelong friends to waiters with the same unfettered enthusiasm . Troma , which make movies in the $ 2-million range and under , has 150 titles in its library . Kaufman values them at $ 75 million to $ 80 million , but admits that his partner thinks that figure is too high .</TEXT>
