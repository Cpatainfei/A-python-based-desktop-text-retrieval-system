   <HEADLINE> ASYLUM OKD ON BASIS OF HOMOSEXUALITY ; IMMIGRATION : GAY_MAN SAID HE WOULD BE PERSECUTED IF RETURNED TO MEXICO . EXPERTS SAY INS RULING IS A FIRST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what appears to be a precedent-setting case , the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has granted asylum to a gay Mexican who said his sexual orientation subjected him to persecution in his homeland . Jose Garcia won his bid to remain in the United States earlier this week after telling immigration authorities that he was ostracized by fellow citizens and harassed , beaten and raped by Mexican police because he is gay . Garcia , who is using a pseudonym to protect his privacy , also presented evidence linking members of the Mexican police and military to assassinations of homosexuals , and said he feared retaliation if he was sent home because he is a visible AIDS education activist in San Francisco . Under U.S. immigration law , asylum is granted only if an applicant can prove &quot; a well-founded fear of persecution based on race , religion , nationality , political opinion or membership in a particular social group. &quot; INS officials said Garcia ' s case appears to mark the first time their agency has acknowledged that a homosexual may belong_to a persecuted social_group that deserves asylum . Last year , an immigration judge in San Francisco granted asylum to a gay Brazilian man who was being deported by the INS . The judge acted after hearing evidence of pervasive anti-gay violence in Brazil , including the testimony of a prominent anthropologist who estimated that a Brazilian homosexual is killed every five days . Experts say the Garcia decision is different because it marks the first time the INS has granted a petition based on sexual orientation . &quot; To have the agency itself make this finding is an important precedent , &quot; said Charles Wheeler , directing attorney of the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles . &quot; In the past , membership in a social_group has been a very difficult category to prove. &quot; Ron Silberstein , Garcia ' s San Francisco attorney , agreed : &quot; Lawyers have been arguing for this for a long_time . It ' s nice to see the Immigration Service agree with us. &quot; Advocates for gay and lesbian rights hailed the decision as a breakthrough . In Los Angeles , leaders of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund expressed hope that Garcia ' s success would help three applicants -- a Russian lesbian and two gay_men from Iran and Nicaragua -- they are aiding with asylum petitions . &quot; This nation has always been a beacon of hope for those who are persecuted in their homelands , &quot; said J Craig Fong , Lambda western regional director . &quot; It is gratifying to now see the U.S. offer safe_harbor for those persecuted for their sexual orientation. &quot; INS officials , however , cautioned that Garcia ' s victory is no guarantee for others . &quot; It does not mean by any stretch of the imagination that anyone who is gay in Mexico has a valid case for asylum in the U.S. , &quot; said Duke Austin , an INS spokesman in Washington . &quot; The facts in this case simply convinced the officer that asylum was warranted. &quot; Garcia , who is in his mid-30s , came_to the United States 12 years ago after what he called a life of unspeakable degradations in Mexico . Taunted and humiliated by his countrymen , he said he was also arrested for patronizing gay bars , jailed for crimes he did not commit , beaten and , on one occasion , raped by a Mexico_City policeman while in custody . &quot; I had no one to turn_to , &quot; Garcia said at a news_conference Thursday . &quot; When I heard that being gay in the United States was tolerated and even accepted in some areas , I had only one desire : to flee Mexico for the United States. &quot; Garcia ' s asylum bid was aided by evidence supplied by the International Gay and Lesbian Human_Rights Commission . The commission described rampant intolerance in Mexico and said police and government officials have obstructed the investigation of a series of assassinations of transvestites in Chiapas . Mexican government officials defended their country ' s treatment of gays and lesbians and called Garcia ' s portrayal of life there inaccurate . &quot; We respect the human_rights of anyone without consideration of sexual orientation , &quot; said Daphne Roemer , spokeswoman for the Consul General of Mexico in San Francisco . If Garcia had brought his concerns to Mexico ' s human_rights commission , she added , he would have learned that &quot; we ' re very concerned about these issues. &quot; Times researcher Norma Kaufman contributed to this story .</TEXT>
