   <HEADLINE> HONDA CIVIC RANKED MOST FUEL-EFFICIENT OF 1995 CARS ; AUTOS : GEO METRO XFI DROPPED OFF LISTING BY EPA . LUXURY MODELS WERE BIGGEST GAS GUZZLERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After five years of dominating the fuel economy derby , the Geo Metro is taking a back seat in 1995 -- to be replaced by a Honda . The Honda Civic hatchback emerged as the stingiest gasoline miser on_the_road among 1995 model cars , with Honda subcompacts accounting_for half of the 10 most fuel-efficient vehicles , the Environmental Protection Agency said in a report to be officially released today . Two Geo Metro models of subcompacts still made the top-10 list . But missing was the Geo Metro XFi which had been No . 1 for five straight years . Last year , Geo Metro cars finished first , second and third . A spokesman for General Motors said the Geo XFi model was discontinued for the 1995 model year . The Honda Civic hatchback was rated at 56 miles per gallon on the highway and 47 m.p.g. in city driving , the best among the new 1995 model cars tested . As has been the case in past years , a string of luxury and high-performance cars made_up the list of biggest gas guzzlers . The Lamborghini Diablo had the worst gas mileage at 9 m.p.g. in city driving and 14 m.p.g. on the highway . Eight of the 10 worst mileage cars were various models of the Rolls-Royce . The EPA estimated it costs $ 1 # 841 a year to fuel a Lamborghini , compared to $ 750 for a Ford Taurus ( 21 m.p.g. ) and $ 338 for the Honda Civic hatchback . The estimates were based on 15 # 000 miles of travel and average gasoline prices . The EPA list showed 39 cars that were subject_to the &quot; gas guzzler &quot; tax because of poor mileage , about the same as last year . The vast majority of cars and lights trucks were in the 18 m.p.g. to 29 m.p.g. category in combined city and highway driving . The Mazda Protege ( 34 m.p.g. ) was the stingiest compact_car and the Mazda 626 ( 29 m.p.g. ) had_the_best performance among mid-size automobiles . And about 7 % of the vehicles -- or 61 cars among those tested -- showed combined city and highway mileage of 30 m.p.g. or better . Nearly half of the cars and trucks tested had mileage of 20 m.p.g. or less , including 84 cars with mileage of less than 15 m.p.g. The Suzuki Samurai ( 29 combined m.p.g. ) and the Suzuki Sidekick and Geo Tracker convertible ( both 27 m.p.g. ) were the most fuel-efficient light trucks . The EPA provided no overall average mileage figures for 1995 models ; officials said no such analysis had yet been done . But it is believed the overall numbers have not changed much from the last few years when average mileage among all vehicles has been about 28 m.p.g. &quot; Nothing has jumped_out that says there is a change here , &quot; said Tom Ball of the EPA ' s automobile fuel economy testing office in Ann Arbor , Mich . Some critics of the auto industry said the figures show again that market forces are not enough to get auto_makers to increase fuel economy . President Clinton recently named an advisory commission to develop a plan to reduce automobile emissions , mainly carbon_dioxide from burning gasoline , that are linked to global warming .</TEXT>
