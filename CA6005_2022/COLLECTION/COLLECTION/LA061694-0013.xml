   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / GEORGE WEIGEL : A DEEP SPLIT BETWEEN U.S. AND THE VATICAN ; TO CLINTON , THE U.N. POPULATION CONFERENCE SIGNALS A MERE DISAGREEMENT . TO THE CHURCH , IT IS A MORAL TRAGEDY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If President Clinton believes that he and Pope John Paul II have simply agreed to disagree at September ' s U.N. Conference on Population and Development , or that there has been any narrowing of the gap between U.S. population policy and the Vatican ' s rejection of abortion as a universal &quot; reproductive right , &quot; then we may be heading for the most serious confrontation between the U.S._government and the Holy_See since Woodrow Wilson helped block Pope Benedict XV ' s participation in the Versailles peace conference after World_War I . The Administration would like to think that , in international public life as well as in American domestic affairs , the Catholic position on abortion is a sectarian anomaly of no real political consequence . The Holy_See ' s understanding of the_matter is entirely different . For Pope John Paul II , the abortion debate engages basic questions of universal human_rights , including the integrity of the family as the basic building-block of civil society and democracy . Viewed through that prism , the American insistence on abortion as an instrument of family_planning around the world is the real act of cultural imperialism . The draft document that will be debated at Cairo in September was bitterly contested during a preparatory conference in New York in April . Those who have plowed through the result of those labors -- 118 pages of turgid U.N.-speak -- have discovered a population-control program of astonishing ambition and scope . Indeed , were the Cairo conference to adopt the draft document in its essentials , it would enshrine in international_law a view of human_relationships and human sexuality that is far more reflective of Western feminist orthodoxies and the eugenic fevers within the &quot; population_control &quot; movement than of any sustainable international moral consensus . In that respect , the draft Cairo document is the worst form of elitism : the enlightened ( upper-class Westerners and U.N. bureaucrats ) instructing the benighted masses about the pursuit of real happiness . And here -- rather than in any arcane Catholic moral theology -- is the root of thePope ' s profound concerns about the Cairo conference . For Cairo is emphatically not about demographics and numbers . Nor is it about the relationship between population and development ( only six of the 118 pages of the draft document deal with the formal topic of the meeting ) . Rather , the Cairo conference is about lifestyles and about promoting the sexual revolution through coercive state power . An exaggeration ? Hardly . The draft document mandates states to override the prerogatives of parents on adolescent sexual education and envisions large-scale propaganda campaigns : &quot; Governments . . . should . . . use the entertainment media , including radio and television soap_operas and drama , folk theater and other traditional media &quot; to persuade the recalcitrant . In a truly Orwellian move , the document even demands that governments &quot; ensure &quot; that &quot; health-care providers &quot; have the proper &quot; attitudes &quot; toward their teen-age patients . That the &quot; attitudes &quot; in_question are those in Planned Parenthood clinics or school-based condom-distribution offices seems a reasonable assumption . It is precisely this soft totalitarianism , which violates America ' s historic commitment to human freedom , that the Pope urged Clinton to reject . Nor is the Pope alone in his concerns ; on the very day that John Paul met with Clinton , Argentina ' s President Carlos Menem wrote all Latin_American heads of government , requesting that they develop a common approach to the Cairo conference to address problems of population , development and women ' s health without conceding the argument over humane family-planning to the most radical population-controllers . In an Administration not notable for its foreign-policy dexterity , Menem ' s letter ought to provoke some serious reflection . Thus Clinton and his advisers would be making a grave error if they persist_in regarding the Catholic_Church ' s approach to the Cairo conference as tactical or confessional . It may be a quirk of history ( though some of us believe it Providence ) that the world ' s most influential moral teacher today is John Paul II . For the world ' s leading political power and the world ' s greatest moral authority to conflict on a fundamental question of human_rights is a tragedy . And the way to resolve that conflict is not to agree to disagree . It is for the Clinton_Administration to disentangle itself from the ideology of population_control that it is trying to impose on the world in the name of &quot; reproductive rights. &quot;</TEXT>
