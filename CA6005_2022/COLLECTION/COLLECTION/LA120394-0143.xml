   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MEXICO SHOWS FOREIGN INVESTORS A SMOOTH SHIFT OF POWER ; TRADE : SOME U.S. INVESTORS SAY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION MAY EVEN PUSH FOR THE SALE OF NATIONAL ENERGY AND RAIL COMPANIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the cameras focused_on the familiar faces of Cuban President Fidel Castro and U.S. Vice_President Al Gore at Mexico ' s presidential inauguration this week , a lower-profile group of foreign dignitaries watched the event from miles away on closed_circuit television . About 200 U.S. investors -- bankers , portfolio managers and heads of major corporations -- were invited to the inauguration as guests of a government eager to assure them that their investments are secure and that the transition between an administration they have come_to trust and President Ernesto Zedillo ' s new team will be smooth . And despite some grumbling about their remote vantage_point , investors here for the ceremony -- as well as those staying behind in the United States -- said they are favorably impressed by what they see of Zedillo ' s economic_policy . Indeed , well-connected investors expect him to deepen the free-market reforms of his predecessor , privatizing the railroads , electricity distribution and even part or all_of Pemex , the national oil_company , an almost-sacred symbol of nationalism . Zedillo hasn ' t addressed such questions publicly , and it remains to be seen how easily such politically powerful entities as Pemex , the National Railroad and the Federal Electric Commissions could be turned_over to the private sector . All would require constitutional amendments and approval by two-thirds of the Mexican Congress . But it would be consistent with the thinking of the country ' s new president , whose inauguration speech on Thursday promised economic_growth without inflation and pledged to keep a close rein on government spending . &quot; Sustained growth requires an environment of economic and financial stability that guarantees certainty and confidence for saving , planning , investing and working productively , &quot; Zedillo said . &quot; This demands clear rules and fair treatment for everyone. &quot; Endorsement by the foreign investment community is crucial to a nation whose economic development program hinges_on continued flows of foreign capital . Yet the investors ' presence remains a delicate issue in sovereignty-conscious Mexico , where many citizens are still surprised , 11 months after the North_American Free_Trade Agreement took_effect , to find their country in a trade pact with the United States and Canada . Sovereignty may become even more of an issue as the new administration sells the few government-owned companies that remain from the hundreds auctioned_off during the past eight years . Officially , those industries still under government control are termed strategic ; in reality , most of have remained in government hands due_to their political importance . Investors and senior government officials said privately that they expect the railroads , electricity and oil will be sold during this administration . All three fall_under the purview of Zedillo ' s most controversial cabinet appointee , Ignacio Pichardo , who has been accused by the former assistant attorney_general of using his position as chairman of the ruling party to obstruct a high-profile murder investigation . &quot; I believe we are going_to see the oil and gas industry moving toward privatization , &quot; said Jack Krol , vice_chairman of chemical giant DuPont Co. , owner of oil_company Conoco . &quot; They have been thinking_about it now for two or three years . It ' s now a matter of how , rather than ' Are we going_to do_it ? ' &quot; The previous administration of President Carlos Salinas failed to find buyers for several petrochemical plants , partly because they were put_on the block during a cyclical downturn in the international industry . Krol said he expects the Zedillo goverment to sell_off entire divisions of Petroleos Mexicanos , the national oil monopoly . &quot; They must have the scale to be competitive globally , &quot; he said . &quot; There is a big difference in the way people are thinking today. &quot; Krol added that DuPont would be an interested bidder for numerous Pemex assets , including petrochemical , natural_gas , oil exploration and production , and refining . Investors ' main worry in Mexico isn ' t Zedillo ' s economic_policies but whether the 42-year-old Yale-educated economist will be able to restore the political and social stability that they had taken_for granted in Mexico until this year ' s dual political assassinations and a wave of kidnapings . For example , nervousness over the threat of new violence next week in the southern state of Chiapas was blamed for Friday ' s steep 53.86-point drop_in the Mexican stock_market . Still , investors seemed reassured by the familiar faces in economic posts . Finance_Minister Jaime Serra Puche and Commerce Minister Herminio Blanco were their nation ' s chief NAFTA negotiators and spent weeks promoting the agreement to U.S. investors and business people . Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria is_well known to bankers for his key role in solving this country ' s debt crisis in the 1980s . &quot; We think this is an excellent cabinet , &quot; said Geoffrey Dennis , head of Latin_American Research at Bear Stearns . &quot; It is chock full of good , reform-minded young technocrats . We expect no significant change in policy . He has put his marker firmly in the sand. &quot; Dennis said he also was encouraged by Zedillo ' s inauguration speech promises of continuing to balance the federal budget and to fight inflation , now about 7 % a year , down from 159 % six years ago . Zedillo told the Mexican Congress , &quot; We will not destroy the stability that the people have achieved with such sacrifice. &quot; Meanwhile , an eight-page special advertising section titled &quot; The Mexican Investor &quot; appeared in major U.S. newspapers on inauguration_day , featuring an interview with Zedillo and touting economic opportunities in this country . Though the foreign investors who traveled here for the inauguration were disappointed to be watching it from a room at the National Anthropology Museum , near their hotel , most understood about security concerns and the limited seating in the Legislative Palace , where the ceremony was held . And Friday ' s private meeting with Zedillo must have soothed their egos .</TEXT>
