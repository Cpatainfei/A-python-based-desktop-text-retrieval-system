   <HEADLINE> OPEN ENROLLMENT , CLOSE DOORS ? ; LEGISLATION : NEW LAW COULD CREATE DISTRICT SUPER TEAMS , DENYING SOME STUDENTS A CHANCE TO PLAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Open enrollment might forever alter the face of high_school athletics , leading to the formation of high-powered &quot; district teams &quot; that compete in super leagues based on district enrollment . Far-fetched ? Not to Bob Cooper , the Hoover High baseball_coach of 20 years . After examining new legislation that permits students to attend any school within a district , he offers a hypothetical example in the Glendale Unified School District . Glendale High , with its first-rate stadium , would field the district football_team . Crescenta Valley would field the basketball_team and Hoover the baseball_team . Players wishing to participate at the highly competitive district level would attend the school fielding the particular team . Schools also would field less competitive &quot; club teams , &quot; creating a two-tiered system of high_school athletics . &quot; My feeling is that ( open enrollment ) is going_to put some schools out of certain sports , &quot; Cooper said . &quot; It might start with small sports . If you want to play , you go_to this school . &quot; I think it ' s sad , because a tremendous number of kids will not be able to participate. &quot; The idea of district teams , startling at first , has some appealing aspects . Undue influence and transfer rules become immaterial . Money is saved . A superb level of competition is born . It might start this way : A district decides that any student wanting to swim or play water_polo attend the only district school with a pool . A district golf team is next . Then a wrestling team . In major sports , the trend would begin with the best players gravitating to a particular school because of its superior program . Soon , a district team would be in place , like it or not . Colorado has had open enrollment for two years . Already , there is a move toward district teams . &quot; We call them athletic magnet schools , and that may very well be the direction high_school activities are going , &quot; said Bert Borgmann , assistant commissioner of athletics in Colorado . Colorado took the first_step this year by implementing a rule that allows schools to combine teams with neighboring schools if those schools are unable to field a team . Gymnastics and other minor sports already have fielded what Borgmann terms &quot; cooperative teams. &quot; Closer to home , check_out the Crenshaw boys ' basketball_team . Nine transfer students have made the Cougars one of the best teams in the nation . Their games are more of a con than a contest . &quot; Once you become a dynasty , other schools get discouraged , &quot; said Francis Nakano , an assistant superintendent in the L.A. Unified School District . &quot; People tend to hate you when you win all_the time. &quot; Under a district team plan , Crenshaw might get some competition instead of the steady barrage of scorn it receives now . The City Section , with 49 high_schools , could be broken_into perhaps 10 sub-districts for the purposes of forming district teams . &quot; Crenshaw is the standard , the granddaddy of all recruiters , the team all recruiters strive to equal , &quot; Taft basketball_Coach Jim Woodard said with more_than a trace of sarcasm . District teams would eliminate the need to recruit . Any player who wants to play with the best simply tries_out . The most heated competition might be among coaches : Who gets the district team ?</TEXT>
