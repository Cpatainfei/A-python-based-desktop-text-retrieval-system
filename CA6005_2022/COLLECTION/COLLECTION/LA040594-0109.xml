   <HEADLINE> HEAD OF NUCLEAR RESEARCH LAB RESIGNS UNDER FIRE ; SCIENCE : JOHN H . NUCKOLLS WAS UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO LEAVE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE BECAUSE OF ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT . THE ACTION COMES AT A TIME OF MAJOR RESTRUCTURING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , one of the government ' s premier nuclear_weapons research_centers , resigned Monday -- just days before University of California President Jack W . Peltason was prepared to call_for his termination because of mismanagement at the billion-dollar lab . John H . Nuckolls , 63 , has come under increasing pressure from Peltason to step_down from the $ 195 # 500-a-year post since February , when an internal review panel found &quot; serious management shortcomings &quot; during Nuckolls ' tenure over the last five years . Nuckolls was supported by prominent physicist Edward Teller , the father of the hydrogen_bomb , and appeared to be rallying some support among UC regents , who are responsible_for overseeing Lawrence Livermore and two other university labs , sources said . But in a March 30 letter to Nuckolls labeled &quot; personal and in strict confidence , &quot; Peltason cited Nuckoll ' s &quot; failure to accept my repeated requests that you resign &quot; and served notice that he would ask the regents Wednesday to fire him for &quot; significant deficiencies in your management abilities. &quot; Neither Nuckolls nor Peltason could be reached for comment late Monday but both men released statements announcing the resignation . Peltason said he will recommend a temporary replacement Wednesday for Nuckolls , who is stepping_down May 1 &quot; for personal reasons &quot; but will continue as an associate director at_large . In a post-Cold War era of &quot; revolutionary change , I believe the laboratory will benefit greatly by the new thinking and new vitality provided by a new director , &quot; Nuckolls said . Nuckolls ' resignation comes at a key time for the lab , which has a budget of slightly more_than $ 1 billion . With the ending of the Cold_War , the federal_government has dramatically scaled_down funding for nuclear_weapons research and the university has been scrambling to redirect its scientists into joint_ventures with private companies . Since Nuckolls took_over the lab in 1988 , the number of joint_ventures with companies ranging from IBM and General Motors to start-up biotech firms has grown from none to more_than 100 , said lab spokesman Jeff Garberson . But Nuckolls has been criticized by some for being too_much of a cold warrior . Last month , the lab director appeared before a panel of the House Armed Services Committee in Washington to warn about the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the need to keep nuclear defense skills high , and to argue that the withdrawal of government funding for weapons research be reversed , Garberson said . He has also fought against a proposal in Congress to consolidate nuclear_weapons research , a move that would shift those functions from Livermore to UC ' s lab at Los Alamos , N.M. , where the atom_bomb was developed , said Hugh DeWitt , a staff physicist at Livermore for 37 years and a critic of Nuckolls . &quot; It marks him as a director from the Cold_War era , &quot; DeWitt said . When Nuckolls took_over the Bay Area laboratory five years ago , about $ 315 million of the annual $ 896 million in federal funding was spent on weapons research . Today , that amount has dwindled to $ 198 million out of $ 705 million . The lab has 7 # 400 full-time positions for scientific_research , including the civilian fields of biotechnology , energy science and laser use . Nuckolls joined Livermore in 1955 , three years after the lab was founded , and worked in the lab ' s A Division , which designs thermonuclear_bombs . He led research into &quot; Star Wars &quot; concepts , such_as missile-destroying lasers , and worked_on &quot; inertial confinement fusion , &quot; which attempts to create a miniature type of hydrogen_bomb by using lasers to explode pellets of hydrogen isotopes . But it was his management skills that brought_about the confrontation with Peltason . Even by scientists who support his views on nuclear_weapons and proliferation , Nuckolls was seen as an &quot; indecisive manager &quot; who &quot; lets things slide , &quot; DeWitt said . As an example , DeWitt said Nuckolls left a key position in the physics department unfilled for five months , prompting the department to begin &quot; drifting &quot; and causing a drop-off in fundamental research . His management became the issue after a seven-member panel appointed by Peltason last fall conducted a review of how Nuckolls was running the lab . A UC spokesman said the panel interviewed more_than 70 people -- 34 lab employees who submitted written statements and the rest high-level U.S. Department_of_Energy or Pentagon officials . Although universally known to have been negative , the review ' s specific findings have not been released . But in a letter to Peltason dated March 28 , Nuckolls said the panel spent only two days at the lab and based its conclusions on &quot; erroneous information. &quot; He wrote that officials from the lab ' s principal &quot; customers &quot; -- the Pentagon and Department_of_Energy ' s defense_programs -- wanted him to continue for national security reasons . He also raised the question of political retribution because the review panel was chaired by Richard Truly , a former National Aeronautics and Space Administration administrator who was dismissed after reportedly being criticized by Teller and others . University sources said Teller was involved in lobbying regents in Nuckolls ' behalf this week but that the showdown was averted by the director ' s resignation .</TEXT>
