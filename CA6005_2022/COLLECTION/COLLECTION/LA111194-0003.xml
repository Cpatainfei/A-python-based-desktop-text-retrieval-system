   <TEXT> Scientists on both sides of the Atlantic launched ozone-mapping balloons and rockets Thursday as the space shuttle Atlantis and its tag-along satellite soared overhead and made their own survey . Researchers need the extra insight into Earth ' s ozone_layer to make_sure the information they get from the orbiting spacecraft is correct . NASA has launched 18 weather balloons and 20 small rockets from Wallops Island , Va. , so far for the experiment . The German weather service has sent up 15 ozone-measuring balloons from an observatory in Bavaria . Russian scientists have sent up at least two rockets with atmospheric monitors . The launches will continue until the six shuttle astronauts retrieve the German satellite Saturday for the trip home on Monday . The crew released the satellite last Friday . Ozone in the stratosphere protects humans , animals and plants from ultraviolet rays ; man-made chemicals are weakening this layer , especially over Antarctica .</TEXT>
