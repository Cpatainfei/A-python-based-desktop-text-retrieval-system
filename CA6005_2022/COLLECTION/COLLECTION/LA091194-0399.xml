   <TEXT> The European Union said Saturday that it is ready to send 135 monitors to Yugoslavia ' s border with Bosnia-Herzegovina to check on Belgrade ' s promise that no war supplies reach Bosnian Serbs . The foreign_ministers of the 12 EU nations , at an informal meeting on this Baltic_Sea island , endorsed a lifting of sanctions against Serbia if Belgrade acts decisively to cut supply_lines to Bosnian Serb troops , officials said . Lord Owen , the EU ' s Bosnia mediator , told the ministers that at least 135 monitors would be required to determine whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is honoring his pledge . Sweden , Finland , Norway and Denmark offered 60 monitors , officials said . The operation would also involve 150 Yugoslav monitors . The officials said the EU foresees a scenario under which monitors will be quickly deployed to see if the Yugoslav-Bosnian border remains closed . If it does , the United States , Russia , France , Germany and Britain will draft a U.N. resolution providing_for a gradual lifting of sanctions against Belgrade , which has urged Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan for Bosnia . The foreign_ministers also agreed there should be no lifting of the arms embargo against the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo , a step advocated by the United States .</TEXT>
