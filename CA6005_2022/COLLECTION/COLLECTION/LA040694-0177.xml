   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA NOW READY TO JOIN NATO PROGRAM ; MILITARY : EARLIER THE KREMLIN HAD SAID A DECISION WAS HALF A YEAR OFF . CRITICS OBJECT TO THE LACK OF SPECIAL STATUS FOR THE EX-SUPERPOWER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an announcement meant to end mixed signals from the Kremlin , the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Russia plans to go_ahead and sign_on to NATO ' s Partnership for Peace program by the end of this month . President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s spokesman had warned last week that Yeltsin was having second_thoughts about joining the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s loose affiliation designed for former Warsaw Pact members . He said it could take six or seven months for a Russian consensus to be reached on the_matter . But Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin said Tuesday that the partnership could help &quot; strengthen overall European security. &quot; He said Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev plans to sign an agreement on Russia ' s membership April 21 in Brussels . &quot; That will be the date of our joining the program , &quot; Churkin told reporters . Some Russian objections to the partnership deal appear to remain , stemming in part from Moscow ' s concern that it will not enjoy special status in the group despite its superior military might . Russian nationalists have also complained that the partnership is merely a post-Cold War cover_for luring all_of Moscow ' s former Warsaw Pact allies into NATO . Some military analysts also worry that membership could hamper Russian operations in other former Soviet republics , territory Moscow sees as falling within its own sphere_of_influence . But the Kremlin appears to have decided to work from inside the NATO program rather than keeping its distance . &quot; We have very serious possibilities to influence the system from inside , &quot; said Alexander A . Konovalov , a military analyst at the U.S.A.-Canada Institute in Moscow . &quot; Joining the program , we avoid the military-political isolation which would have been inevitable. &quot; Konovalov said that Russia ' s Security_Council and other top bodies have approved the plan to join the Partnership for Peace . But Yeltsin apparently balked after hard-line lawmakers at parliamentary hearings warned that Russia would have to toe NATO ' s line . &quot; Deputies have realized that it is fashionable today to be patriotic , &quot; Konovalov said , bemoaning lawmakers ' refusal to understand the basics of the actual partnership program . The Partnership for Peace was put_together last year to offer a way to foster better military cooperation between the former Soviet Bloc countries -- many of which were clamoring for entry into NATO -- and the Atlantic Alliance . Members participate in joint military exercises and share some training and peacekeeping work , but no security guarantees are offered . Six former Soviet republics -- Estonia , Georgia , Latvia , Lithuania , Moldova and Ukraine -- have already joined , along with much of Eastern Europe . The whole program is still highly makeshift and amorphous . Churkin said that even after Russia joins in principle , it will take six or seven months to work_out the conditions of its membership . Exactly what the basis was for presidential spokesman Vyacheslav V . Kostikov ' s statements last Friday about a different six months -- time he said was needed to sell the public on the program -- remains unclear . He indicated that growing opposition to joining the program had led Yeltsin to decide he would need a national consensus . &quot; This process may take six to seven months , &quot; Kostikov said . Kozyrev came_out immediately afterward , asserting the agreement will be signed at the end of April -- proving if nothing else that the Russian government remains confused and somewhat uncoordinated in its positions . The final_decision must come from Yeltsin himself . But it appears unlikely the Foreign Ministry would contradict him on so basic an issue . Kostikov , on the other hand , is known to voice his own opinions , although , as spokesman , he is supposed to represent the president ' s views . The newspaper Sevodnya ( Today ) commented that Russian public_opinion is actually quite indifferent to the Partnership for Peace program . Deputies may oppose it , but since the Parliament will not have to ratify it , Yeltsin need not change his views to accommodate lawmakers . Instead , Sevodnya said , the president was probably responding to concern from the military Establishment and critics of the West , like Vladimir P . Lukin , head of the lower house ' s Foreign Affairs Committee . They worry that the Partnership for Peace program will hinder Russia ' s arms sales and require it to open its military budget to real public scrutiny , the newspaper said .</TEXT>
