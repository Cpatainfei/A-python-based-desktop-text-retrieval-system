   <HEADLINE> JUKE JOINTS , ROADHOUSES AND SOUTHERN PARABLES ; THE DOCUMENTARY LYRICISM OF PHOTOGRAPHER BIRNEY IMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> COLUMBUS , A COUNTY_SEAT OF 23 # 800 IN NORTHEAST Mississippi , is as pretty as an antique ball_gown . In its well-preserved but not over-dandified historic district , more_than a 100 stately pleasure domes survive from the antebellum era , and goo-goo clusters of architecture and history buffs regularly trek through the broad , shady avenues to marvel at restored showplaces with nobby names like Shadowlawn , White Arches and Rosewood Manor . It ' s a slow , rocking-chair kind of place where everyone seemingly knows everyone else and the residents are likely to wave to you from their lawns and trellised verandas . Still , the overall feel of the place is modern , if not quite postmodern . A franchise-choked commercial strip spreads like a weed patch along the east-west highway , and downtown -- where a little known but gifted photographer named Birney Imes keeps a studio above the old Princess Theater -- is still intact and vital . In 1990 , Imes positioned himself among the cream of Southern documentary lyricists with the publication of &quot; Juke Joint. &quot; The book comprises a series of paradoxically lush-colored , yet stark images taken_in the lowdown black honky-tonks and rural dance_halls of the Mississippi Delta , some 200 miles from Columbus -- places with names like &quot; The Out of Sight Club &quot; and &quot; The Uptight Cafe. &quot; For weeks , I pored over Imes ' dreamy , almost unpeopled photos , admiring his delicacy in capturing the decor and ambience of an insular black subculture -- Imes himself is white -- and savoring the juicy strangeness of the Delta milieu . The photographer ' s strongest images , endearingly funky and executed in classic documentary style , recalled James Agee ' s dictum about the camera being the central instrument of the age . &quot; ( The ) camera can do what nothing else in the world can do , &quot; Agee wrote , &quot; . . . perceive , record , and communicate , in full unaltered power , the peculiar kinds of poetic vitality which blaze in every real_thing and which are in great degree . . . lost to every_other kind of art. &quot; When I called Imes to make hasty arrangements to visit his hometown , he was agreeable to getting_together , although he said he was &quot; right busy &quot; making prints for his first Southern California exhibition ( at the Gallery of Contemporary Photography in Santa Monica through Aug . 28 ) . He went_on to say that he had various pressing domestic obligations , such_as coaching a Little_League ballgame , preparatory to leaving with his family the following week for a long-planned vacation in England . &quot; Have you ever been to Mississippi ? &quot; Imes asked politely . I told him I ' d once set_out on a quixotic quest to meet William Faulkner . I got as close as Faulkner ' s front gate , came_to my senses and went_home to Texas . &quot; The same thing happened to me with Walker Percy , &quot; Imes said , laughing . &quot; Come on down . we ' ll drive_around and see some of the countryside. &quot; I took lodgings at the Amzi Love Bed &amp; Breakfast , a hospitable haven built_in 1848 , and I was just unpacking when Imes dropped_by from his house in the next block with a set of galleys for his new book , &quot; Whispering Pines , &quot; named after a gritty country roadhouse that gradually desegregated itself during the ' 70s and ' 80s . Imes , who is 43 , has clear hazel eyes and a halting , shy , Jimmy Stewart-sort of delivery . Even exchanging our brief how-do-you-do ' s , he struck me as a man who ponders things , turns them over in his mind . There are several stories related in &quot; Whispering Pines &quot; -- hard and compassionate , devilish and rhapsodic -- but the principal one belongs_to Blume Triplett , a backwoods product of Mississippi ' s segregationist past . Until about a generation ago , strident and often violent resistance to the mixing of the races kept the state and , indeed , the entirety of the Old Confederacy , on the wrong foot in the national parade . Kick-started by the civil_rights movement and grounded in the traditional interconnectedness of blacks_and_whites , an organic change began to take_hold . &quot; Whispering Pines &quot; conjures a place and a time and a process -- the palpable world of a highway beer joint -- through an internal narrative and a cast of characters worthy of a great Southern novel . &quot; It must have been 1975 or 1976 when I first set foot in the Pines , &quot; Imes relates in a lucid accompanying essay . &quot; I had just begun photographing seriously and would spend hours driving_back roads looking_for a . . . situation to photograph . It didn ' t take long to stumble upon the place . . . the rusting cars , the hedge in the parking_lot dividing the White Side and the Black Side , and the stuff . . . inside and out : coin scales , pinball_machines , jukeboxes , lawn_mowers , old campaign posters , newspapers , guns , cigar_boxes and beer signs . . . . &quot; At the center of it all was Blume Clayton Triplett , born in . . . 1902 . Blume had moved . . . nearby . . . in the early twenties to open a mechanic shop . . . . ( In ) 1921 , Blume married Eppie Cunningham , and it was for Miss Eppie that he built the Pines almost thirty years later . . . . &quot; By the time I walked into the Pines , Eppie had been dead a_couple_of years and the place was a shell of its former self . Food was no longer served ; Blume held court on the White Side with an occasional ( customer ) stopping by to visit , drink a beer and reminisce . . . . Rosie Stevenson . . . operated the Black Side . &quot; My visits were usually long ; we would spend hours telling stories , sharing meals , listening to the jukebox and making pictures . There was a sense of family among Blume , Rosie and the rest of the neighborhood , all sharing a common history . And there was always something going_on -- a dog to bury , a birthday to celebrate , a chitlins supper for the regulars . . . . I loved the place , and I loved the people passing_through it . . . . &quot; Blume ' s health began to decline , and he moved_over to the Black Side so Rosie could better take_care of him . The White Side , clogged with debris he had collected over the years , became known as the ' archives. ' Though Blume ' s last years were spent without sight , he enjoyed receiving a steady stream of visitors , smoking cheap cigars , listening to blues music . . . until a ruptured appendix put him in the hospital in 1989 . He never returned to the Pines . . . . &quot; Rosie , who will inherit the property , says she has no plans to reopen . . . . Even now when I go_in and walk through those rooms I enter some sort of reverie . It ' s as though I ' m the curator and sole patron of a forgotten museum . . . . &quot; Imes photographs the faded domain of the Pines -- the grizzled Triplett , the sweet-faced Rosie and a large supporting cast of poor black and good ol ' boy patrons -- with a sense of transfixed wonder . It ' s a signature trait carried_over from &quot; Juke Joint ' s &quot; vision of Southern-slash-American culture as a constant interplay of &quot; found &quot; and refound materials , an inextricable blend rather than separate , autonomous cultures . But &quot; Whispering Pines &quot; is looser and larger than &quot; Juke Joint &quot; -- and vastly deeper . Cultural snobs will have a hard_time with the book because it celebrates a larger-than-life , cruder-than-dirt , stereotypical &quot; cracker &quot; -- a feral old duff not even near the fringes of respectable society . Imes sees and captures in Triplett an odd human instrument whose slow and painful demise suggests the close of one chapter of our national history and the opening of another . The gentlest of Imes ' images memorialize Triplett in post-mortem cigar-box assemblages of the old pack_rat ' s prized trinkets and relics . The rest of the photos are raw and indelible , suffused with the gorgeous and appalling spectacle of the real . When I closed the book near midnight of my first day ' s stay , I realized exactly what had drawn me to Columbus . Over a period of 15 years , keeping tabs on a country barkeep ' s allegiances and life changes , Birney Imes had photographed a parable of the New South . DRESSED IN KHAKI SLACKS AND A BLUE cotton shirt , with an athletic spring in his step , Imes looks_like a boyish but very sharp young professor . He called_for me early the next day and we had coffee with his wife , Beth , who is also an artist as well as the longtime director of Columbus ' arts-in-the-schools program . The couple ' s children -- Peter , 15 , John , 13 , and a daughter , Tanner , 11 -- trooped through the large kitchen on their way to year-end classes , all_of them resembling one or the other of their striking parents . Imes showed me a well-thumbed copy of &quot; Passionate Visions of the American South : Self-Taught Artists From 1940 to the Present , &quot; chortling fondly over the &quot; outsider &quot; contributors ' blunt-spoken statements of purpose . Fat cardinals pecked_at a feeder outside the window , and a distant carillon pealed out &quot; Let the Lower Lights Be Burning. &quot; The Imes house , a modernized 1 1 / 2-story Victorian , seemed modest and lived-in compared to the columned shrines nearby . But it was far removed in psychic miles from Blume Triplett ' s dilapidated fiefdom . In his beat-up Honda , Imes drove me through the historic quarter , pointing_out landmarks -- the Friendship Cemetery , with its ranks of Union and Confederate markers from the Battle_of_Shiloh , and the former rectory of St . Paul ' s Episcopal Church that served as Tennessee Williams ' first home . Imes is uncommonly well-read , and we began a continuing discussion of the Southern writers we admired , ranging from Faulkner to Breece D ' J Pancake and Richard Ford ( who wrote the introduction to &quot; Juke Joint &quot; ) . Cruising back toward downtown , Imes spotted a friend named Jackie Ball and pulled over to the curb . Ball , a stocky black_man with a sweat shirt knotted around his neck , approached the car and leaned down at the window . &quot; Hey , Birney ! &quot; &quot; How y ' doing , Jackie ? Meet my friend here. &quot; Ball pressed my hand with a hard , measuring grip , and the two of them exchanged a minute ' s small_talk . &quot; Jackie is_on the City_Council now . He gives everybody hell , I guess , &quot; Imes said , driving on . &quot; He ' s a really great guy and a good friend of mine. &quot; He glanced across at me to see if I was alert to his meaning . &quot; Jackie sort of changed my life , in fact . We met back in the late ' 60s when the schools were first being integrated . We played sports together , ran track and all . He showed me a whole world I ' d never known about before , and that kind of blew things open for me. &quot; Imes parked under the Princess Theater marquee . &quot; Columbus was smaller then , if you can imagine it , and there was almost no crossover between blacks_and_whites . It ' s a better , healthier place now . Listen , are you hungry yet ? There ' s a pretty good soul-food place a_couple_of doors down. &quot; Our check for dressing and gravy , butter_beans and iced_tea came_to a total of $ 5.50. And everybody in the small cafe eventually drifted by to say hello to Imes , pat him amiably on the shoulder and wish him good_luck on his trip &quot; overseas. &quot; Imes graduated from the University of Tennessee ( Class of ' 73 ) with a history degree but no clear sense_of_direction . He traveled around the country for a while , sampling the territory and the possibilities from Massachusetts to Southern California . Then he returned to Columbus and took a job at the family newspaper , where he taught himself the nuts_and_bolts of photography . Imes ' father , like his father before him , is the owner and publisher of Columbus ' daily Commercial Dispatch . At the paper , Imes handled the assignments of a journeyman staffer -- shooting high-school football games and wrecks on the highway -- but he also began to develop full-page photo essays twice a week . The work plunged him into exploring the unmapped purlieus of &quot; the Prairie , &quot; a nearby rural_area whose inhabitants -- people like Blume Triplett and Rosie Stevenson -- still lived_in ways largely untouched by contemporary history . Imes photographed coon hunts , river baptisms and hog killings in the Prairie ' s scattered black_and_white communities , ingratiating himself with the locals by &quot; visiting &quot; before breaking_out his camera . His standard approach was to make friends , then to make pictures , and he usually returned later with prints of his work to cement the relationship . Imes left the paper after a year and a half , but committed to photography by now , he opened a shop of_his_own , shooting family portraits and the_like to pay the rent and support his frequent returns to the back_country . His commercial work eventually grew to include advertising accounts and editorial assignments for such publications as the Washington Post Magazine and Texas Monthly . He also served as the set photographer on &quot; Mississippi Masala. &quot; Meanwhile , his &quot; own work &quot; as a self-taught artist also flourished . At the 20-year mark in his career , Imes ' photographs have been included in shows at the Museum of Modern Art , the Whitney Museum ' s Phillip Morris branch and the University of Arizona ' s Center for Creative Photography . In a 1991 group show at the Tartt Gallery in Washington , Imes ' Delta images were displayed along with the works of William Christenberry , Keith Carter , William Eggleston , Debbie Fleming Caffery and Clarence John Laughlin -- a generation of distinguished Southern photographers . We had been talking in Imes ' handsome , Spartan studio above the old movie_house for almost an hour , with the photographer relating his vita in candid and often whimsical anecdotes . But when I asked about his relation_to those leading Southern lights featured in the Tartt show , he paused and let_out a little sigh , seeming flustered . With some prodding -- &quot; Who helped you learn things ? &quot; -- he said finally : &quot; Well , I mean , I can throw_out names of people whose work I was drawn to -- Robert Frank . . . Josef Koudelka . And I think everyone who photographs in_color owes something to William Eggleston . And to many others , you know. &quot; Well , I thought I knew . In a coded , guarded way , Imes seemed to be saying that his ambitions surpassed the regional . He meant to be world-class . Restive , Imes rose from his chair and I switched_off the tape_recorder . He crossed the room to the tall windows overlooking the street and stood peering out for a minute . Then he turned_back to me , smiling and motioning toward the door . &quot; Let ' s go_for a ride , &quot; he suggested . IMES DROVE WEST across the Tombigbee_River and turned south on U.S. 45 into the Prairie . The highway , almost empty_of traffic , wound through low , rolling hills and lush farmland cultivated in patches of cotton and immense tracts of soybeans . Hedgerows of green_ash and red_oak lined the fields , and dirt lanes snaked off toward hidden farmhouses . The day was warm , edging toward steamy , and we rode through stretches of sun and shadow with the windows rolled_down and a hint of rain in the rushing air . We talked casually at first , then fell silent . The land and the towering thickets of trees gave_off a dense , primeval hum that enfolded you after a while . Fifteen miles from town , Imes pulled_off into a tangle of undergrowth that I didn ' t immediately recognize as a parking_lot and rolled to a stop at the end of a cinder-block building resembling a stock shed . The old WHISPERING PINES sign lettered along the roof line had faded almost to invisibility . Across the lot , two black_men in work clothes emerged from a screen_door and wrestled an ancient dresser into a pickup_truck . Imes greeted them pleasantly and called_out , &quot; Where ' s Rosie ? &quot; &quot; She ' s inside , sir. &quot; &quot; Welcome to the ' archives , ' &quot; Imes said and led the way into the gloomy partitioned rooms , cautioning me to watch my step . Almost at once I slipped_on a mangled 45-r.p.m. record , part of the litter scattered all_over the pocky slab floor . Ragged and nearly impassable aisles ran_through boxes , crates , cartons , piles , stacks , heaps and bunches of miscellaneous goods and trash . Years of grime and dust_covered everything . Rosie Stevenson stepped_forward to greet Imes and to shake my hand with a friendly , appraising look . &quot; Ain ' t it a mess ? &quot; she asked , rolling her eyes . &quot; I ' m gonna need me a lot of hands to ever get_it all cleaned up. &quot; &quot; Well , a whole bunch of it ' s gone already , &quot; Imes said . &quot; You giving some more stuff away ? &quot; &quot; Yes . Those men out yonder are workin ' at my house . I let ' em have those old dressers in the back and some_other little things they might use. &quot; &quot; Triplett never threw anything away ? &quot; I asked . &quot; Anything at all ? &quot; &quot; No , &quot; Rosie said , &quot; he never much did. &quot; Imes laughed and pointed to a tottering cairn of cigar_boxes , scores of them stacked halfway to the ceiling . &quot; Beth came_out once and asked him for five or six of those for a Sunday_School project , and it was like she was asking_for pearls or something . He finally let her have ' em , but under pressure. &quot; &quot; Set_in his ways. &quot; &quot; Yes , he was , &quot; Rosie said . &quot; But I worked for him , and he was everything to me . You could say he was just like a father , a brother , a husband or what-have-you . We had some real good times_out here , him and me and all_of us. &quot; &quot; There were booths when I first started coming_by , &quot; Imes said , walking_around . &quot; Peoples ' names were carved in them . There was a door that said ' Yellow Canary Dining Room , ' and the one over there said ' Colored Dining Room. ' &quot; &quot; How did the dividing line start to break_down ? &quot; &quot; Oh , it was more fun on the Black Side , &quot; Imes said . &quot; Right ? &quot; &quot; Yeah , &quot; Rosie nodded with a smile , &quot; it was more fun . I worked both sides , and peoples over here would say , ' Rosie , why can ' t I go_over there ? Seems like y ' all ' s music is better over there than ours. ' I said , ' Well , it ' s all_right with me . If Mr. Blume don ' t care , go on. ' Sometimes he would say they could , and sometimes he ' d tell ' em no . Then it got_to where he didn ' t care . He sat on ( the Black Side ) all_the time anyway , and then everybody else would come_on that side . It was just a natural thing. &quot; &quot; Step back through here , &quot; Imes beckoned . He led the way along a dogleg hall and opened the door on a dingy , cluttered little cubicle with one small window . &quot; This is where Blume lived_in his last 10 years . The bed ' s gone , but otherwise it ' s pretty much the way he left it . After his eyesight went , Rosie would put him to bed at night and he ' d stay here until she came_back the next morning . She cooked for him , did everything for him . And really , she was his closest kin and her family was part of his extended family. &quot; Toeing around in the mulch on the floor , I spotted a spent . 38 shell . Imes picked_up a folded $ 10 bill and stood pensively turning it over in his hands . Just then -- &quot; ' Scuse us , please &quot; -- the workmen entered and began to move a three-legged dresser out of a closet . &quot; Oh , this is hard to watch , &quot; Imes said softly , retreating to the Black Side , where he walked_around in little circles with his hands in his pockets . Mopping my brow against the muggy heat , I asked Rosie to tell me more about Triplett . &quot; You talkin ' ' bout how he was with other people ? &quot; She reflected . &quot; Well , there were times when I thought that he were mean . Then , in his older days , he were very good . He was kind-hearted. &quot; She bent to pick_up a packet of crumpled Christmas_cards , smoothing them . &quot; But you know , when all is said and done , I believe he ' s with the Lord . I think , you know , he made some good choices and he made some bad choices . But put the good and the bad together , and I just say he was all_right . He was all right. &quot; Smiling , Imes came_over and handed Rosie the $ 10 bill . &quot; This was_on the bedroom floor. &quot; &quot; It was ? &quot; She tucked the money into her handbag and slipped the strap over her arm . &quot; Well , I ' m goin ' home -- it ' s gettin ' hot . I ' ll let you lock_up . Got your key ? OK. &quot; At the door , she turned_to wave -- and pointed a mock-stern finger at me . &quot; Now you be good , hear ? And I hope you ' ll be enjoyin ' your stay down here. &quot; Together and singly , Imes and I roamed around the Black Side , rummaging through Triplett ' s jumbled collections . The agglomeration was stupefying : political leaflets , Bible tracts , soda_pop signs , toys , stoves , defunct TVs , tools , newspapers and correspondence dating_back 50 years . It was a redneck Xanadu , a catalogue raisonne of American junk . After a while , Imes wandered back into Triplett ' s bedroom , and I followed . This time I picked_up the . 38 casing as a souvenir . &quot; Was there often violence out here ? Fistfights and so on ? &quot; &quot; No . Blume was pretty much a no-foolishness kind of guy . He always carried a gun , ( but ) he ' d just run people off if they were troublemakers. &quot; Imes went_on to say that Triplett was neither a drinker nor a hard-core racist and basically aimed to get_along_with everybody . &quot; He dearly loved celebrations and went_to all lengths to stir one up . He ' d write_on dollar_bills , little sayings , and give them to people for birthday_presents . ' Keep Me and You ' ll Never Be Broke ' -- things like that. &quot; Imes peered warily into the empty closet , then turned_away . He mentioned again that it was distressing to see the Pines being dismantled . &quot; Blume made me the executor for his will , and I had the place pretty much to myself for a_couple_of years . I drove_out , oh , once or twice a month to nose around , see what I could find . The things I was really interested in were his relics and letters . Gradually , I picked_out things I knew that he prized , photographing some of the cigar-box assemblages here and some back at the studio . &quot; But when I first started coming_to the Pines in the mid- ' 70s , I had no idea a book would ever develop out of it . I was just one of the regulars . There were always people coming_through , and all kinds of stories and different things happening . Blume just sort of sat and absorbed it all -- relished it all -- and I don ' t think there was anything stereotypical at all_in his relationship to the black community . He felt in a family way toward much of the clientele . I think they all understood and loved each other in their own way , despite their faults or the ( happenings of the ) past . The transformation of racial attitudes was a very powerful thing to witness. &quot; Late in the afternoon , the sky darkened and thunder rumbled across the Prairie . &quot; It ' s about to rain , &quot; Imes said , locking_up , and we dashed for the car as the first drops fell . He drove a maze of country roads back toward town as the storm burst in blinding sheets . Imes had recorded Triplett ' s 84th birthday_party , and he put the tape in the deck with a little smile . Over the thrumming rain , Triplett ' s voice crackled with the force of nature : &quot; This is Blume talkin ' , and I just want to say a_few words to all_of y ' all . I had a mighty good time today . My friend Birney Imes come_down about 11 o ' clock . He come_by to get some barbecue , and then he got a peach pie and some chitlins . We been eatin ' chitlins . ( SOUND OF A ROOSTER CROWING. ) You hear my rooster cryin ' , don ' t you ? He run in the door , he done come_in . Birney ' s been takin ' some pictures , a good friend of mine , and he took a picture of my rooster . He took a picture of all_of us ! And ( we ) went_out from the kitchen and I got a 30-gallon cask drum_out there , and I got a goose settin ' in it . And he took a picture of the goose . I got four Chinese white geese , one hen and three jacks . Birney took a picture of all_of us ! &quot;</TEXT>
