   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; TODAY ' S GAMES AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> GROUP F at Florida Citrus Bowl , Orlando , Fla . Belgium vs . Netherlands * TIME : 9:30 a.m. PDT . * TV : ABC , Univision . * KEY MATCHUPS : Belgian Coach Paul Van Himst will use three forwards instead of two , guaranteeing a defensive mind-set.It ' s the only way he believes his team can play in hot , humid weather , which continues to drain energy and dictates a slower pace . Josip Weber , Belgium ' s scoring threat , did little last Sunday against Morocco . He and Marc Degryse , who scored Belgium ' s only goal , will be the forwards today . Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat ' s team is offense-oriented . Advocaat probably will make one change , starting forward Gaston Taument in place of Marc Overmars . Taument scored the game-winner in Holland ' s 2-1 decision over Saudi_Arabia . * OUTLOOK : Belgium will be a slave to defense , taking few chances and waiting for counterattacks . Holland will attack , but this game won ' t be an offensive display because neither team is accustomed to this weather . Look_for the Dutch to use their speed on the wings and try to get the ball to Dennis Bergkamp . * OUTCOME : Because both won their first games , neither team is in a must-win situation . However , neither particularly wants to win the group title , because that would mean a game against the second-place finisher in tough Group E in Orlando . Second place brings an easier foe , the runner-up in Group_B . That will probably be Cameroon , Sweden or Russia . Look_for a 1-1 tie . HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
