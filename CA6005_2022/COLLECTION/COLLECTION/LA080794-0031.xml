   <HEADLINE> AMERICA , TAKE OFF YOUR SUNGLASSES ; LOOKING_AT THE SUN : THE RISE OF THE NEW EAST ASIAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEM , BY JAMES FALLOWS ( PANTHEON : $ 25 ; 528 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In &quot; Looking_at the Sun , &quot; James Fallows declares that the majority of Japan ' s nationally elected politicians are sons of politicians . The statement is one of many Fallows makes to warn American readers that Japan is not the democratic country they imagine it to be ; it is also one of many that does not jibe with the facts . While it is true that political families are more common in Japan than in the land of the Kennedys , Rockefellers or Browns , at last count , of 511 members of Japan ' s lower house , 114 ( about one out of every five ) were sons of politicians . Even by the most liberal reckoning , fewer than one-third of Japan ' s political elite is linked by marriage or blood ties to previously serving politicians . An intriguing question that arises while one reads this book is why Fallows insists on gilding the lily ? It seems that for this politically influential writer and broadcaster , it is not enough that Japan be alien , the country must also appear to be outlandish . This tendency is not merely a flaw of this book but of current thinking about Japan in Washington , where being tough on Japan seems to be far more important these days than having accurate information about the country . According to Fallows , Japan is an undemocratic country where elections mean nothing , and where promises of reform cannot be trusted . Fallows ' message is that Americans should cast_off the illusions their own officials fed them during the Cold_War about a democratic Japan committed to free market ideals and that they should see Japan as the originator of an alien system of state-supported capitalism which is now spreading through Asia and which challenges the long-term well-being of the Anglo-American world . After reading &quot; Looking_at the Sun , &quot; no one can accuse Fallows of being &quot; soft_on Japan. &quot; As for being factually correct , that ' s another matter . There is a pattern to the inaccuracies in this book . For example , Fallows warns Americans that Japan is not a democratic country because power did not change hands through the ballot_box for more_than 100 years . What he does not say is that for the first 22 of those 100 years Japan had no parliament . Then , until 1946 the prime_minister did not have to be an elected politician , so it was impossible for voters to oust him . Fallows also does not say that when the constitution was changed after World_War_II , governments were voted_in and out of office , in 1947 , 1949 and 1954 . Fallows also tells us that most of the members of the reformist coalition of former prime_minister Morihiro Hosokawa ( who took_office in August last year ) were until a_few weeks earlier members of the corrupt , long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party . Fallows ' idea is to show that Japanese promises of reform cannot be taken at face_value . But this too is an example of imagination leaping ahead of easily available information . Of some 260 lower house members of Hosokawa ' s coalition last August , a mere 73 were former LDP politicians . In spite of its many inaccuracies , or rather because of them , &quot; Looking_at the Sun &quot; is an important book . Its negative view of Japan is shared by policy-makers in the Clinton_Administration and this view forms the underpinnings of the present get-tough policy toward Tokyo on trade . The insistence of the Clinton_Administration on getting the Japanese to agree to numerical targets on everything from market-opening measures to a reduction of Japan ' s trade_deficits stems from the above kind of pessimistic assumptions about Japan . Incidentally , the present stalemate in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations is_due in large part to the inflexibility of the numerical target strategy , an approach which assumes that in_order to solve a trade dispute , it is enough if one side , the one with all_the problems , agrees to change . Why does this book contain serious inaccuracies ? One reason is plain carelessness . At one point Fallows describes Sakhalin as a peninsula . When Chekhov wrote his book about the place in the last century , he called it &quot; The Island , &quot; and when I visited Sakhalin a_few years ago it was still neatly separated from Siberia by the Tatar Straits . But another reason for Fallows ' all-pervasive pessimism about Japan seems to be a visceral hostility toward the country . In one anecdote we are told that a teacher of Fallows ' son praised the boy by saying his math was not_bad for a foreigner . The story is presented as a way of showing that Japanese are racists . There are , indeed , many racists in Japan but when it comes_to math scores , Japanese students outperform their U.S. counterparts on internationally administered tests by about 2 to 1 . In this case , the teacher was probably trying to pay a compliment to Fallows ' son . To be sure , Japan does have its problems ; its political institutions are weak . But what Fallows does not tell us is that most Japanese , including some of the elite bureaucrats who wield much of the real power , fervently wish Japan had a government free_of scandals at_home , and more responsive to the rest of the world . Former Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Hisahiko Okazaki and former trade bureaucrat Taichi Sakaiya have written influential books saying just that . Fallows is unfair both to former Japanese prime_minister , Tsutomu Hata , and to his readers , when he describes Hata as a one-time LDP powerbroker best remembered for a gaffe about Japanese having intestines that are too long to digest large quantities of_imported beef . Fallows does not tell us that Hata worked for years for electoral reform from within the LDP . Finally , in spite of Hata ' s remark about long Japanese intestines -- a remark which Hata has since admitted was inappropriate -- American beef is now widely available in Japanese supermarkets at reasonable prices . So_much for a Japan that never changes .</TEXT>
