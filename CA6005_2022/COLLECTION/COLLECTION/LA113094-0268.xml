   <TEXT> Setting Sights Low : Irvine-based Kia Motors America has the lowest-priced four-door sedan in the United States for the 1995 model year with its basic Sephia RS . The $ 8 # 495 car is one of 19 models listed at less than $ 10 # 000 in Automotive News ' catalogue of the base prices of 467 varieties of domestic and imported passenger_cars . Prices range from the $ 8 # 085 , three-door , three-cylinder Geo Metro , to the $ 347 # 200 Rolls-Royce touring limousine . For bargain hunters , the news isn ' t good . Just 4 % of the cars are less than $ 10 # 000 ; none come_with an automatic_transmission or air conditioning , and their base prices don ' t include destination charges . If those are added in , only nine of the cars still slip under the $ 10 # 000 threshold . The companies with the most sub- $ 10 # 000 models , at four each , are Ford and General Motors ' Chevrolet Geo division . Of the 27 Ford models , three make_up its new Aspire family -- made in Korea by Kia Motors Corp . The fourth Ford for less than $ 10 # 000 is the base three-door Escort hatchback . All four of the Chevy Geos -- the Geo Metro line -- are built_in Canada by Suzuki Motor Corp . Including the Geos , Chevrolet has 36 models on the Automotive News list . Like Kia , Suzuki also has its U.S. subsidiary headquarters in Orange County and placed several cars on the under- $ 10 # 000 list . General Motors ' Saturn unit sells one of its seven models for less than $ 10 # 000 . Plymouth , with six models listed , and Dodge , with 14 , each have just one car below $ 10 # 000 : the basic four-door , four-cylinder Neon . Most of the rest of the lowest-priced models come from Orange County-based importers . Kia Motors America sells two of its three Sephia models with base prices below $ 10 # 000 while American Suzuki , in Brea , lists the base price of both of its Swift model passenger_cars at less than $ 10 # 000 . The Suzuki Swifts are the peppier four-cylinder siblings of the three-door , three-cylinder Geo Metro . Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America , in Cypress , has one vehicle below $ 10 # 000 in its 13-model lineup : the two-door Mirage S . Its parent , Mitsubishi Motor Corp. , makes a version of the Mirage in Japan that is sold in the United States by Chrysler Corp. ' s Eagle division as the two-door Summit DL -- the only one of Eagle ' s 13-model lineup to list for less than $ 10 # 000 . Fountain Valley-based Hyundai Motor America , which once dominated the low-price category , now lists just one of its nine models , the basic two-door Scoupe sports coupe , for less than $ 10 # 000 -- and it is just $ 5 under . The 1995 Accent , which replaces the Hyundai Excel that hit the market at less than $ 5 # 000 in 1986 , has not been priced yet . But all three models in the Accent subcompact line are expected to have base prices less than $ 10 # 000 . The only Orange County-based importer with nothing less than $ 10 # 000 is Mazda Motor of America . The least expensive of its 14 models , at $ 11 # 995 , is the four-door Protege DX . Of Japan ' s three largest car_makers only two -- Toyota and Honda , have U.S. offerings in the under- $ 10 # 000 class . Toyota ' s base two-door Tercel , at $ 2 below the mark , is the only one of that company ' s 37 U.S. models to qualify , while the $ 9 # 750 Civic CX three-door is the only one of Honda ' s 27 models to slip under the threshold .
