   <HEADLINE> THEATER ; CHEKHOV ' S ' SEAGULL ' WINGS IT AMONG MULTIPLE CASTS AT MATRIX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chekhov poured a lot of anguish about the act of writing into &quot; The Seagull , &quot; and in the production of the play now at the Matrix Theatre , some actors best known for their TV work pour a lot of anguish about acting into it too . The Matrix features two revolving casts in the story of Konstantin ( Kurt Deutsch / Alastair Duncan ) , the tortured young writer ; Arkadina ( Barbara Babcock / Penny Fuller ) , his great-lady-of-the-theater mother ; Nina ( Julia Campbell / Anna Gunn ) , the aspiring actress who is his muse , and Trigorin ( Robert Foxworth / Cotter Smith ) , the worldly author Nina worships . Both casts ( I saw only one ) are directed by Milton Katselas , one of L.A. ' s premiere acting teachers . As a director , Katselas seems much more interested in indulging individual performances than in supplying one coherent vision of Chekhov ' s haunted artists . Unfortunately , one wants not to indulge but to throttle most of these performers . Deutsch ' s Konstantin complains of his mother ' s selfishness while draping himself all_over his uncle ' s lap like a kvetchy baby ; his histrionic self-absorption would out-emote anything his mother could possibly come_up with . In the last act , life has taught Konstantin to be sober , and Deutsch achieves this by looking disconcertingly like Ryan O ' Neal disapproving of Barbra Streisand in &quot; What ' s Up , Doc ? &quot; Campbell reduces Nina from a girl shimmering with an appetite for the beauty of the world to an annoying suck-up . She throws_back her shoulders , thrusts her breasts forward and pants with ambition even before she sees Trigorin and has a suitable outlet for all her heaving . This reading of Nina has the unfortunate effect of rendering her none too bright and making Trigorin ' s seduction of her a very sleazy affair ; she is not touching but transparent . So too is Babcock ' s Arkadina , although hers is not nearly so primitive a performance . Her alarm at considering Nina ' s youth and its possible effect on Trigorin is quite obvious , yet we are asked to believe she is a great ( or at least a famous ) actress on the Russian stage . Katselas turns the Act Three scene in which Arkadina pleads , bullies and does anything she must to get Trigorin to stay with her into a kind of raging burlesque , a knock-down fight that ends with Arkadina pulling her lover ' s head by his hair to her breast . Other liberties with the text , such_as when Konstantin rushes at Nina with a shotgun , at times give this production the quality of a Mel Brooks parody of what can happen when Hollywood meets Chekhov . * As the snuff-using Masha , Jeanie Hackett resembles an unstable high_school coke addict , but she ' s at least amusing , with one notable exception . She manages to drown one of the funniest opening_lines in all_of theater . When the schoolteacher Medvedenko ( Richard Kind / Gregory Cooke ) asks her why she ' s dressed in black , Hackett ' s Masha answers , &quot; I ' m in mourning . . . ( turns_to audience , waits a beat , flings a bunch of dried flowers ) . . . for my life. &quot; As Dorn , the doctor , Jeffrey Tambor employs the big-eyed , uncomprehending stare that makes his character on the Garry Shandling show so great , and it works here for him when he ' s pushing valerian drops on everyone like Valium . But , when he ' s a man of the material world rhapsodizing about what it must be like to be an artist , the same expression makes the character a tad more fatuous than is necessary . This is one of Chekhov ' s most romantic plays in that most of the characters attach romantic notions to the art of writing . Just as Dorn imagines that creating must be like soaring , Nina believes it to be the greatest human ecstasy . And Arkadina ' s elderly brother , Sorin ( Stephen Elliott / Robin Gammell ) , is the most romantic of all . In that role , Elliott gives a performance that actually hints at the vast melancholy and amusement that Chekhov took_in observing the world . He describes himself as &quot; the man who wanted &quot; -- the man who wanted to become so many things that he did not . When he talks_about writing , his eyes grow dreamy behind thick glasses as he imagines the glory of what it must be like &quot; even to become a second-rate writer. &quot; Here Elliott captures the perhaps Old_World sensation of believing the ability to capture life on paper is one of God ' s great gifts . In its press material , the Matrix notes that &quot; each role will be shared by at least two actors , with different combinations creating a new experience each night. &quot; Of course , no two performances are ever alike anyway , but in the case of &quot; The Seagull , &quot; one hopes they are as different as possible . * &quot; The Seagull , &quot; Matrix Theatre , 7657 Melrose Ave. , Tuesday-Saturday , 8 p.m. ; Sunday , 7 p.m. Ends Dec . 18 . $ 15 .
