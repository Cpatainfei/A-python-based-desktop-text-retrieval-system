   <TEXT> In a darkened editing room , sequestered behind the eternally guarded walls of Paramount Pictures , a film image flickers on a small screen . Six men gather around an editing table , their faces a whirligig of light and color projected by the moving image . Their eyes are transfixed on fresh footage of a miniature Capt . James T . Kirk , struggling atop a desert mountain on the uninhabited planet of Varidian Three in the finale of &quot; Star Trek : Generations , &quot; which opens Friday . The aging but spry Kirk , reprised by William Shatner , inches along a footbridge that clings with a tenuous grip to the mountainside . &quot; This is the final bridge he must cross , &quot; producer Rick Berman tells the music composer and sound artists around him in the editing room . In moments , they will take Berman ' s &quot; notes &quot; and begin devising the effects that will turn the action into a bone-jarring sequence in six-channel sound . Despite assurances that 1991 ' s &quot; Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country &quot; was the final voyage for the original &quot; Star Trek &quot; gang from the 1960s TV series , Kirk and a couple others have been resurrected to pass the feature-film baton to the crew from the wildly successful TV spinoff , &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation. &quot; The new movie features the epic meeting of the 23rd-Century Kirk and his 24th-Century counterpart , Capt . Jean-Luc Picard , played by Patrick Stewart . &quot; You ' re going to have nothing but this metal bridge moaning and creaking and screeching , &quot; continues Berman , who executive produced the &quot; Next Generation &quot; series and makes his first foray_into feature_films with &quot; Generations. &quot; &quot; I don ' t know if you can see it on this , but these bolts and rivets are snapping and popping , and there ' re rocks falling . So you ' re going to have some fun with sounds here. &quot; In the scene , Kirk is not only fighting valiantly for the fate of mankind , as has become his custom , he ' s also fighting for Paramount Communications Inc. Every effort is being made to assure that what ' s referred to around Paramount as &quot; the franchise &quot; lives on . Several weeks earlier , the studio agreed to spend $ 3 million to return to the mountaintop location north of Las Vegas to re-shoot a seven-minute end sequence . Test screenings revealed that people rated &quot; Generations &quot; favorably overall but were less than enthusiastic with the finale . And Paramount reportedly wanted more heroism from Kirk . &quot; You ' re going to have to sell this to make us really believe that he ' s slipping_off the bridge , &quot; Berman says . As the bridge jerks violently several times , causing Kirk to lose his footing , Berman imitates the noises he wants to hear . &quot; Uh ! Uh ! Uh ! Whoa ! &quot; Kirk skids down the bridge on his back and reaches_out for a chain at the last second to stop his momentum . . . . * &quot; The picture is now locked ! &quot; Berman proclaims after the session ends . He shakes hands with his film editor , Peter Berger , who worked with Berman from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. the day before . The two heave a symbiotic sigh of relief . It ' s three days before Halloween , and the remaining pieces of their jigsaw_puzzle are finally falling_into_place -- a jigsaw_puzzle that required $ 30 million and nearly two years to complete . &quot; I feel_like I ' ve come_up for air , &quot; Berman says with a wide smile . Berman ' s momentary lightness of being may be_well deserved , but it will pass . The 47-year-old bears the weight of a galaxy on his shoulders . He cannot escape the destiny he inherited three years ago when &quot; Star Trek &quot; creator Gene Roddenberry , an optimistic science-fiction visionary with a reverential following , died and handed_over the reins of a billion-dollar enterprise -- replete with a universe of mythological characters and story lines spanning three decades -- to an ex-documentary producer from New York . &quot; Gene Roddenberry laid a mantle on me , of sorts , and I feel very lucky as a result , &quot; says Berman , who took_over as the master of a franchise that now includes seven feature_films , three hourlong TV series and a fourth one on the way . Berman refers to all_of them as &quot; the show. &quot; &quot; What Gene wanted me to do was basically carry the ball for him , and to try to maintain his vision , &quot; Berman says . &quot; He saw that I had respect for his vision -- not because it ' s my vision . I don ' t believe the 24th Century is going_to be like Gene Roddenberry believed it to be , that people will be free from poverty and greed . But if you ' re going to write and produce for ' Star Trek , ' you ' ve got_to buy_into that. &quot; Although &quot; Next Generation &quot; ended in May , Berman still executive produces two TV spinoffs . &quot; Star Trek : Deep_Space Nine , &quot; set_on a space_station in the 24th Century , returned in September for its third syndicated season . And when the United Paramount Network launches on Jan . 16 , it will depend_on &quot; Star Trek : Voyager , &quot; a new series about a starship lost in an uncharted region of space , to lock_in the viewers necessary to establish a fifth network . &quot; I ' m like a quality-control guy , &quot; Berman says . &quot; My job is to keep this show good , and to keep it believable , and to keep it entertaining , and to keep whatever messages are in it true_to what Gene wanted . He wanted to paint_a_picture of hope in the world , and I would much rather paint_a_picture of hope than a picture of despair. &quot; &quot; Generations &quot; marks the first time the &quot; Star Trek &quot; movies and TV series have been produced by the same person . Roddenberry was heavily involved with the first film , in 1979 , but Paramount gave the sequels other producers and directors , including Shatner and Leonard Nimoy , who played Spock , the inscrutable Vulcan . Berman produced &quot; Generations &quot; in the same hands-on fashion he executive produces his TV series , and he shares story credit for the film . Ever since Roddenberry ' s death , hundreds of thousands of &quot; Star Trek &quot; loyalists have been sizing_up Berman via the Internet and at conventions . And while Trekkers have taken their swipes at Berman , they have been generally supportive of what he has done . But in producing &quot; Generations , &quot; the heat grew uncomfortably for the TV producer . Incessant Internet musings by fans often led to headlines the next day -- including the fact that Berman reshot the well-publicized ending of his film and the fate of a key character . Whereas Roddenberry used to rally his fans with speaking engagements , Berman admits that he doesn ' t entirely understand the fierce devotion some have for &quot; Star Trek. &quot; &quot; The people who talk on their computer_networks all night long , or the people who go_to conventions -- it ' s all a little overwhelming to me , &quot; Berman says . &quot; I can ' t relate that much to people who take this a little bit more seriously than this should be taken . It is , after all , a show. &quot; But ravenous Trekkers clearly are . &quot; People are always hungry for details -- to_the_point where scripts disappear from the lot , &quot; says Kerry McCluggage , chairman of Paramount Television Group . &quot; Almost everything you do is subject_to all kinds of scrutiny and wild speculation. &quot; Indeed , the entire &quot; Generations &quot; script found its way onto the Internet months ago . Berman says : &quot; We have 25 million viewers who watch ' Next Generation , ' 20 million who watch ' Deep_Space Nine , ' and hopefully just as_many who will watch ' Voyager. ' I like to think that we ' re doing this show for the vast majority of fans who bring this ' Star Trek ' family of characters into their home every week , and who embrace the ideas we try to portray on the show. &quot; * After the &quot; Generations &quot; sound session , Berman returns to his offices where the editors from &quot; Deep_Space Nine &quot; are awaiting him to go_over an episode . Sitting behind a monitor , Berman plays_back the episode , stopping the action every 10 or 15 seconds with orders for his editors to tighten a scene by cutting_out a &quot; Yes , sir &quot; here or a reaction shot there . &quot; Stop -- what ' s that line ? What does the script say ? &quot; Berman doesn ' t like how Maj . Kira , played by Nana Visitor , reacts to some information . &quot; Hearing from Sisko on a Cardassian ship is like hearing from Ollie North in Moscow . She should be surprised. &quot; He tells his editors to ask Visitor to come_in and re-record the line . Although Berman may_not be the science-fiction visionary that Roddenberry was , Roddenberry was never the executive producer that Berman has become . Roddenberry was a writer first who consistently rubbed people the wrong way as a producer . He drove his TV writers crazy because there was little dramatic conflict to be found in his idyllic vision of the future , and he routinely scrapped with studio executives who wanted to exploit his product . Because Paramount owns the &quot; Star Trek &quot; franchise , the stubborn Roddenberry ' s power was more perceived than real , but he always had the ability to pull his name off a project or publicly cry_out if he didn ' t approve of something , thereby whipping_up the anger of fans . So Paramount executives treaded carefully . Berman , on the other hand , was a fresh young vice_president at Paramount in 1987 when Roddenberry lobbied the studio to release him from his contract so he could produce &quot; Next Generation. &quot; He has since surrounded himself with writers and producers such_as Michael Pillar , who helped him create and executive produce &quot; Deep Space Nine , &quot; and Jeri Taylor , who joined Berman and Pillar in the same capacity on &quot; Voyager. &quot; Berman gives full credit to them and his entire staff for weaving the complex web of &quot; Star Trek , &quot; but the buck stops with him . Every costume design , casting choice , story and script must clear Berman . &quot; Rick has a remarkable ability to have an awareness of everything that ' s going_on , &quot; Pillar says . &quot; I give him personal credit for saving the pilot of ' Deep_Space Nine ' in the editing room . ( The raw film ) was long , slow , confusing . He went_in there with the editors and came_out with what was reviewed universally as a terrific piece of television film. &quot; B erman knows all too well that ultimately all_of the projects he oversees creatively must serve the financial interests of Paramount , which mines &quot; Star Trek &quot; like a seemingly endless vein of gold . Industry experts estimate that over its seven-season run ending in May , &quot; Next Generation &quot; brought_in $ 511 million in revenue and $ 293 million in profit -- making_it one of the most successful TV_shows in history . &quot; Deep Space Nine &quot; and &quot; Voyager &quot; were sold to TV_stations with different formulas , but they are commanding nearly the same rates from advertisers . Meanwhile , six feature_films have generated close to $ 500 million at box_offices across North_America , with roughly half that going_to the studio . About 23 million videocassettes have been sold domestically of the original &quot; Star Trek &quot; series , &quot; Next Generation &quot; and the feature_films . The two TV series can each be seen in reruns in 75 countries . And there are 63 million books in print , more_than 30 new titles published annually by Simon &amp; Schuster , a division of Paramount ' s parent company , Viacom . &quot; It ' s a cultural phenomenon that ' s really unprecedented , &quot; observes Barry London , vice_chairman of Paramount ' s Motion_Picture Group . With comic_books , toys , collectibles , CD-ROMs and plans for a virtual-reality mall attraction , there may be no way to calculate &quot; Star Trek ' s &quot; actual worth . According to Paramount Licensing Group , there are at least 250 product licensees worldwide ; merchandise sales have passed the $ 1-billion mark . In the face of such pressures , what weighs heaviest on Berman is his debt to the man who bestowed the good_fortune upon him . &quot; Whenever there is an instance in a story or a in piece of casting or or in the general fabric of society in the 24th Century , I always feel Gene sitting on my shoulder , &quot; says Berman . &quot; And if I feel that something goes_against what he believed this show should be , I will fight for it. &quot; Yet on Berman ' s office desk rests a plaster bust of Roddenberry , with a scarf around its eyes and ears . When asked why , Berman says with a sly smile : &quot; There are things said in this room that I think he would hate to hear . Not many , just a few. &quot; In October , 1992 , the space shuttle Columbia rose from Kennedy Space Center in Florida , carrying the ashes of Roddenberry . Majel Barrett , Roddenberry ' s widow , had flown to Houston before the mission and handed a tin containing her husband ' s remains to commander James Wetherbee . When Columbia returned , the ashes were presented to Barrett in a private ceremony in Washington . Roddenberry , a decorated combat pilot for the Army before he became a television writer , always dreamed of traveling in space . &quot; If he could have done_it , he would have liked to have been Capt . Kirk , &quot; says Barrett , who met Roddenberry while playing a nurse on the original series . &quot; The next best thing would be to be an astronaut. &quot; When Roddenberry died of heart_failure at 70 , computer bulletin_boards lit_up for weeks , with megabytes of poetry , tributes and personal remembrances . &quot; One to beam up , &quot; wrote Steve Lesnik on CompuServe , hours after Roddenberry ' s death on Oct . 24 , 1991 . &quot; I sit here now with the tears still in my eyes for a man I never met . . . . I find myself now missing him and hoping to do my best to make that future he began a reality. &quot; The starship Enterprise , as first dreamed_up by Roddenberry , was essentially a 23rd-Century proscenium where Kirk , Spock and Dr. Bones McCoy played_out morality tales in a future where the human spirit always prevailed . The NBC series aired for three seasons from 1966 to 1968 , though it was canceled twice and brought_back by viewer demand . &quot; ' Star Trek ' has become an integral part of the American mythology , &quot; Berman says . &quot; ' Star Trek ' is words like beam me up and transporters and dilithium crystals and warp speed and Starfleet and photon torpedoes and phasers , and all these things are known and understood by most people in America. &quot; Ironically , Berman had never watched a full episode of &quot; Star Trek &quot; when he signed_on to produce &quot; Next Generation. &quot; Berman grew_up in New York , dreaming of becoming an actor . While he was a senior at the University of Wisconsin studying film and television , he was invited to audition for the Yale School of Drama , but he decided to pass . Choosing filmmaking instead , Berman returned to New York City and started working for a variety of documentary_film companies , doing films for the United Nations , the National Science Foundation and United States Information Agency . Later , Berman won an Emmy for producing &quot; The Big Blue Marble , &quot; an educational children ' s program that aired from 1977 to 1982 , mostly on PBS , and he received acclaim for a 1984 PBS special called &quot; The Primal Mind , &quot; examining how Native_Americans perceive reality differently than Europeans do . But by the early 1980s , the documentary business was drying_up , and with his wife and 2-year-old son , Berman headed to Los Angeles , where he eventually landed at Paramount in_charge of current programming . Within a year , he was made a vice_president with responsibility to develop TV movies . And that ' s when he was introduced to Roddenberry . At the time , &quot; Next Generation &quot; was just another idea for a TV_show . At the time , quality dramatic programming was not being made_for syndication . Two days after meeting him , Berman received a call from Roddenberry saying that he wanted to have lunch with him . &quot; We found that we had , in odd ways , a tremendous amount in common , &quot; Berman says . &quot; He had traveled all_over the world . He was fascinated that I knew what the capital of Upper Volta was , and that I had been to parts of Africa and the Middle_East ( to make documentaries ) that he had been to . So we had a lot of fun talking_about faraway places with strange-sounding names. &quot; The next day , Berman was invited to lunch by Roddenberry ' s attorney , who said , &quot; Gene would like you to come and produce the show with him. &quot; Berman replied : &quot; Well , I have a job . I ' m a vice president. &quot; And the attorney said , &quot; Do you want to be a vice_president at a studio , or do you want to produce a television_show ? &quot; Berman walked to his car that night with Lucie Salhany , who was in_charge of domestic television , and confessed his dilemma to her . &quot; She looked_at me and said , ' If the show fails , don ' t worry , I ' ll give you a job , ' &quot; he says . Salhany left Paramount not long after , but she returned last month to head_up the studio ' s new TV network , which will be depending heavily on Berman come January . In Berman , Roddenberry saw someone he could rely_on . &quot; Gene created the show , and I think he wanted to distance himself from it very quickly , &quot; Berman says . &quot; He wasn ' t interested in people who wanted to come_in and fix ' Star Trek. ' He said , ' &quot; Star Trek &quot; doesn ' t need fixing. ' &quot; By the third season , Roddenberry ' s involvement was virtually nonexistent . He died in the middle of the fourth season , after having approved Berman and Pillar ' s plans for &quot; Deep_Space Nine. &quot; Barrett says : &quot; Gene brought Rick down from the white-collar world , in his blue suit and tie , and he taught him ' Star Trek. ' There were all_the people who were saying , ' Hey , nobody can do_it like Roddenberry , ' and that ' s not true . Rick understands the basic idea , the prime directive , and his main objective is toward a better , kinder , more gentle world. &quot; But she does feel it incumbent upon her to warn Berman of the job demands . She has been locked_in a legal battle with Paramount for years over merchandising rights for &quot; Star Trek. &quot; &quot; Rick has been the guy behind the badge , really , for a long_time . Now he ' s got the weight of the empire hanging all_over him that Gene had for so_long . I hope he ' s strong enough to take it , because we put_up with it for 25 years . And believe me , they will come at you with knives drawn . I have to say , it can be horrific. &quot; ' It ' s wonderful . It works beauti fully -- all_of it. &quot; Shortly after his &quot; Deep Space Nine &quot; editing session , Berman is back in his office on the Paramount lot , updating Malcolm McDowell on the telephone . McDowell plays Dr. Soran , the villain in &quot; Generations , &quot; who wants to extinguish stars to alter the course of a mysterious energy ribbon traveling through space . He will stop at nothing to re-enter the nexus , a sort of cosmic Shangri-La that lies within the ribbon , which he involuntarily left 80 years earlier . &quot; We ' ve been working_on it night and day since we got_back . It was a bitch , but it ' s terrific . Congratulations to you . I ' d like you and Patrick and Bill to come see it at the end of next week. &quot; &quot; Generations &quot; has been a learning process for Berman , who began developing the story almost two years ago with two of his &quot; Next Generation &quot; writers , Ron Moore and Brannon Braga , who wrote the screenplay . Last October , Berman called Nimoy to direct . Nimoy drew positive reviews and big box_office for directing &quot; Star Trek III &quot; and &quot; IV , &quot; and he executive produced and helped write the story for &quot; VI. &quot; In each case , the phone_call for his services came from powerful studio heavyweights -- Michael Eisner , Jeffrey Katzenberg , Frank Mancuso -- and he was involved in script development from day one . With &quot; Generations , &quot; Nimoy was being called by a TV producer with a finished script in_hand . Nimoy says he wasn ' t comfortable with the script and wanted a major rewrite , and with a release date looming a year away , there was simply no time . Nimoy also turned_down an offer to play Spock one last time in &quot; Generations. &quot; Initially , the entire original crew was supposed to appear in a 15-minute prologue to the film . When DeForest Kelley also turned_down an offer to come_back as Bones , Berman had to take a different tack . &quot; Once we knew we weren ' t going_to have Leonard and DeForest , it seemed silly to have all_the rest , &quot; Berman says . &quot; So we decided just to pick two . We thought it would be fun to take the biggest and the littlest . that ' s how we ended_up choosing Chekov ( Walter Koenig ) and Scotty ( James Doohan ) &quot; to complement Kirk . Berman chose a frequent &quot; Next Generation &quot; director , David Carson , to helm &quot; Generations. &quot; Berman persuaded Sherry Lansing , chairman of Paramount Motion_Picture Group , to go_with the untested feature director by showing her his work_on the two-hour series premiere of &quot; Deep_Space Nine. &quot; Carson has stepped_up considerably with &quot; Generations. &quot; The &quot; Next Generation &quot; episodes he directed went_for around $ 1.7 million each -- extremely high for a TV series -- but &quot; Generations &quot; cost more_than $ 30 million , features 200 optical effects and is , London says , one of the most heavily marketed movies in Paramount history . Berman says he went_back to re-shoot part of the ending to inject &quot; a little more excitement , a little more action. &quot; When asked why those elements weren ' t there to begin with , Berman says : &quot; It might have been a problem with the writing , or it might have been a problem with the directing or it was probably due_to the fact that when we first wrote this movie it was much bigger than we could afford . &quot; There were some limitations made to the last sequence that were probably a mistake . We storyboarded this movie at five or six days longer than we had , and we had to compress the time . When you have less time to do something , you have to do_it less well , especially when you ' re dealing with action. &quot; An assessment of Berman ' s work ranges from glowing to bitter , depending_upon whom you talk to . Alisha Black is vice_admiral and chief_of_staff for Starships of the Third Fleet , a writing club for about 500 Trekkers , based in Santee , Calif . &quot; There has been a lot of debate within the club about how Rick Berman is carrying_on Gene Roddenberry ' s idea of the ' Star Trek ' universe , &quot; Black says . &quot; I see , and so do others in the club , the ' Star Trek ' shows going_to battle , rather than going_to new places and exploring , discovering new alien life . A lot of people don ' t feel comfortable with it. &quot; &quot; So far , everybody is very , very pleased with what Rick is doing , &quot; counters Daniel Madsen , president of Star Trek : The Official Fan Club in Aurora , Colo . &quot; ' Star Trek ' has probably become a little bit more militant than when Gene was in control solely . But it ' s healthy that ' Star Trek ' evolves and changes while staying true_to Gene ' s vision. &quot; If ratings are any indication , Berman has done very well , indeed . &quot; Next Generation &quot; did not become the top-rated show in syndication until after Roddenberry ' s death . &quot; Deep Space Nine , &quot; which was about 25 % off &quot; Next Generation ' s &quot; ratings last season , has improved this season and has become the highest-rated dramatic show in first-run syndication . Bjo Trimble , who publishes the science-fiction newsletter Space-Time Continuum , was instrumental in forming the letter-writing campaign that brought_back &quot; Star Trek &quot; after NBC first canceled it . She says , &quot; Because Gene so wanted to see world peace in his time , he kind of lost track of the fact that conflict and resolution are the meat of a good_story , and you can ' t always have it with the giant purple magilla attacking the ship. &quot; With &quot; Voyager , &quot; the &quot; Star Trek &quot; franchise returns to its roots in many ways . The &quot; Star Trek &quot; universe has become very crowded over the last 25 years , with Klingons , Romulans , Vulcans and the whole gang in the Alpha Quadrant . &quot; But the original intent of Mr. Roddenberry was to have a ship alone out there in the unknown , &quot; Pillar says . &quot; We ' re out there alone in the unknown , with none of the familiar aliens to trouble us , and a whole bunch of new ones. &quot; In &quot; Voyager , &quot; a crew of Starfleet officers on a new breed of starship , with organic components and nerve endings throughout , are blasted into the other side of the galaxy while chasing a rebel ship of freedom fighters . They must team_up , the indignant outlaws and the squeaky-clean Starfleet officers , to find their way home . &quot; We find ourselves today as a society with a lot of problems that cannot be easily and quickly solved , &quot; Pillar says . &quot; I think we have the knowledge if we begin now , but we won ' t see solutions in our lifetime . If you look_at the ' Voyager ' premise from that perspective , this is a journey they ' re taking , which may take them longer than their own lifetime. &quot; The cast of characters includes a Native_American , a pair of mismatched alien lovers , and a holographic doctor -- who will provide the traditional function of Spock , Data and Odo by allowing the crew to reflect on their human values . And in the ongoing evolution of the series , the ship will be led by a female captain , played by Kate Mulgrew , the veteran stage and TV actress probably best known as Mrs . Columbo in her short-lived NBC series &quot; Kate Loves a Mystery. &quot; Berman expects &quot; Voyager &quot; to be the last &quot; Star Trek &quot; series that he will executive produce , although he wants to continue producing movie sequels ; he ' s already working_on story ideas for the next one . Beyond that , he has no idea how long he will lord over the &quot; Star Trek &quot; universe . &quot; When we brought_in ' Deep_Space Nine , ' we had two ' Star Trek ' shows on at_the_same_time , &quot; he says . &quot; That could be perceived as getting a little piggy . Then when ' Next Generation ' was getting ready to leave for the movies , we developed ' Voyager. ' &quot; I don ' t know at what point America is going_to cry , ' Enough ! ' I just know that we ' ve got_to keep pushing along and continue doing our best work and not worry too_much about what ' s going_to happen in five years. &quot; It ' s evening . People have gone_home and the Paramount lot is mostly dark . But Berman is hovering inside a post-production house , watching reel nine of &quot; Generations &quot; to approve the final sound mix . Tucked at his side are five &quot; Deep Space Nine &quot; and &quot; Voyager &quot; scripts that he will take_home and read over the weekend , and he ' s upset that he may miss his son ' s fencing tournament Saturday to come_in and oversee the mix of three more reels . But at the moment , his eyes are transfixed on the huge theatrical screen looming in front of him . The reel is playing_out the film ' s most impressive sequence , from a visual effects standpoint , featuring a spectacular crash of a starship into a planet . Berman leans over to a visitor at one point and says , &quot; Most of the work is work . This I find exhilarating ! &quot; The starship sheers off the tip of a mountain , then hits the ground and slides for an interminable mile , mowing_down towering trees to create a wide swath through a lush forest . Afterward , the lights come_up and a crew of technicians turn toward Berman expectantly . &quot; All right , &quot; he says thoughtfully , &quot; I ' ve got a whole bunch of notes. &quot;</TEXT>
