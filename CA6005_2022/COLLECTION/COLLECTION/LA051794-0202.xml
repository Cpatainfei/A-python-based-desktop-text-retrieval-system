   <HEADLINE> ASSAULT CAUSING MISCARRIAGE CAN BE MURDER CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a landmark ruling , the California Supreme Court held Monday that a person can be convicted of murder for causing the death of a fetus that could have been legally aborted . The 6-to-1 decision will allow prosecutors to charge a defendant with murder for causing a pregnant woman to miscarry , even if her fetus had been only seven to eight weeks old and incapable of surviving outside her womb . Although the case will not directly affect abortion rights , which are protected by constitutional privacy guarantees , activists on both sides of the abortion debate watched it closely because it posed the moral issue of when life begins . The court ' s decision gives California arguably the toughest fetal murder law in the nation . It means that a robber could be sentenced to death if in the course of his crime he injured a pregnant woman and caused her to miscarry , even if he was unaware that the woman was pregnant . Prosecutors also may charge a defendant with multiple murder -- a death_penalty offense -- for killing a pregnant woman whose fetus could not have survived outside her womb . &quot; The third-party killing of a fetus with malice aforethought is murder . . . as long as the state can show that the fetus has progressed beyond the embryonic stage of seven to eight weeks , &quot; Chief_Justice Malcolm Lucas wrote for the majority . Until now most California courts have interpreted state law to provide_for murder_charges only in the killing of a fetus capable of surviving outside the mother , generally not earlier than about 25 weeks . Under Roe vs . Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court ' s benchmark ruling on abortion , a woman is free to abort her fetus until it becomes viable outside the womb . Anti-abortion forces hailed the California ruling as confirmation that even a young fetus is a person . They said the decision underscored the absurdity of allowing a mother to abort a fetus whose killing would constitute murder if done_by a third_party . &quot; This is a victory of sorts because it is giving the identity of humanity to an unborn child , &quot; said Anne Kindt , executive_director of the Right_to_Life League of Southern California . &quot; This type of ruling says , hey , what is in the womb is a human_being , a baby. &quot; Abortion rights activists generally are uncomfortable with laws that treat the fetus as a victim independent of the mother . Abby Leibman , executive_director of California Woman ' s Law Center , said the California Supreme Court has moved the law in a &quot; very troubling direction &quot; by paving the way for regulating the behavior of pregnant women . If the fetus is considered a person , she said , lawmakers may eventually try to punish a pregnant woman for behavior that could injure her fetus . &quot; If I smoke while pregnant , &quot; she asked rhetorically , &quot; am I going_to be subject_to criminal sanctions ? &quot; Justice Stanley Mosk , in a lengthy and graphic dissent , complained that the court has defined as murder the killing of a creature &quot; roughly the size of a peanut , &quot; with webbed hands and feet and a vestigial tail . &quot; If this tiny creature is examined under a magnifying glass , &quot; he wrote , &quot; its appearance remains less than human . Its bulbous head takes_up almost half of its body and is bent sharply downward ; its eye_sockets are widely spaced ; its pug-like nostrils open forward. &quot; Under the majority ' s decision , Mosk said , an unarmed shoplifter who accidentally knocks_down a woman who is seven weeks pregnant , causing her to miscarry , could face death or life in prison without the possibility of parole . Mosk also said that 15 % to 20 % of all pregnancies end in spontaneous_abortion at seven weeks , making_it difficult for courts to determine whether an assault caused the miscarriage . The court ruled_in a San Diego case in which a 20-year-old man was convicted of murder for causing a woman to miscarry during a March , 1991 , robbery . Maria Flores , then 21 , had just cashed a $ 378 welfare check when Robert Davis approached her and demanded her money . Clutching her toddler in one arm , Flores refused to give_up her cash , and Davis fired a bullet into her chest . The pregnant woman crumpled to the ground , rolling_over and over in a vain attempt to grab the money . &quot; Dinero , &quot; a witness heard her whimper . Flores survived the shooting but her male fetus , not yet six months old , was stillborn . It died of loss of blood to the placenta and asphyxiation caused by Flores ' loss of blood , low blood_pressure and shock . During Davis ' trial , fetal experts testified that the fetus was 22 to 25 weeks old . They disagreed over whether it could have survived outside the womb , but none put the chance of survival greater than 50 % . Superior_Court Judge Michael Wellington , over the objections of the defense , told the jury that a &quot; fetus is viable when it has achieved the capability for independent existence ; that is , when it is possible for it to survive the trauma of birth although with artificial medical aid. &quot; The standard jury instruction defined a viable fetus as one probably capable of living outside the womb , a definition that would have been more favorable to Davis . The jury convicted Davis of the murder of the fetus , but indicated that it was not convinced that he knew Flores had been pregnant . She weighed 192 pounds when she was not pregnant and stood 5 feet , 1 inch tall . Davis appealed the murder_conviction . The 4th District Court of Appeal went beyond viability instructions , ruling that any fetus could be murdered if it had progressed beyond the embryonic stage . But the court also held that the ruling could not be applied retroactively and reversed Davis ' murder_conviction . The California high_court agreed that the new ruling cannot be applied retroactively to Davis . Justices Marvin Baxter and Ronald George dissented , contending that the jury instructions in the case were grounded in two appellate decisions . After the Court of Appeal ruling , the Los Angeles district_attorney charged defendants with fetal murder in two cases in which the fetus was not yet viable . In one case , the defendant pleaded guilty in a plea bargain and was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole . In the other , prosecutors dropped the fetal murder_charge because they could not prove that the fetus was alive at the time its mother was shot . Deputy San Diego Public_Defender Jeffrey Thoma , who represented Davis , said he looked_forward to telling him &quot; he may have his life back. &quot; Davis was sentenced to life without parole for the murder , assault and robbery . Without the murder_conviction , he faces about 11 years , Thoma said . He noted that California is now the only state in the country where someone can be sentenced to death for killing a fetus incapable of surviving outside the womb . Deputy Atty . Gen . Pamela Klahn , who represented the state in the case , stressed that the ruling would not affect a woman ' s right to an abortion . She also said she did not know whether prosecutors would attempt to retry Davis on the murder_charges under the previous court rulings on viability . &quot; This is about a third-party non-consensual killing of a fetus , &quot; Klahn said . &quot; Roe ' s principles apply only in the narrow context of the abortion decision. &quot; * COURT RULING : Imminent danger defense , used by Menendezes , is upheld .
