   <HEADLINE> SMOKING BANNED BY O.C.-BASED TACO BELL CHAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taco Bell Corp . said Monday that it will ban smoking at its company-owned restaurants and that most of its franchisees are expected to follow_suit , giving the Mexican-style fast-food chain the largest_number of smoke-free outlets in the nation . The Irvine-based company said it will snuff_out cigarettes , cigars and pipes at its 3 # 300 company locations nationwide on March 28 and that at least 1 # 000 additional sites owned by franchisees will also ban smoking . Taco Bell ' s action follows similar steps taken by other fast-food chains , including No . 1 McDonald ' s Inc. , as the effects of second-hand smoke -- especially on children -- are being scrutinized more closely at local and federal levels . U.S. Surgeon Gen . Joycelyn Elders on Monday praised Taco Bell , McDonald ' s and other smoke-free chains that cater to youths . &quot; I ' m very grateful that many of our fast-food restaurants are taking this stand_for our children , who cannot decide their own environment , &quot; she said . U.S. Rep . Henry Waxman , ( D-Los Angeles ) , who is sponsoring federal legislation to ban smoking in public places , said that Taco Bell ' s decision &quot; shows a real sense of corporate responsibility for the health of customers , especially children , who should not to be forced to breathe_in someone else ' s smoke. &quot; Taco Bell ' s action follows a trend that has been growing for some time . Four years ago , the California Restaurant Assn . called_for legislation to ban smoking in all restaurants . Two years ago , the Carl ' s Jr . and Chuck E . Cheese chains banned smoking in company-owned eateries . And Arby ' s and Dairy Queen announced plans earlier this year to eliminate smoking at company-owned units . McDonald ' s Corp. , bowing to pressure from consumer groups , said three weeks ago that it would ban smoking at 1 # 400 company outlets . About 2 # 200 franchise units were already smoke-free , bringing the company ' s total nonsmoking units to 3 # 600 of its 9 # 100 restaurants nationwide . No other franchisees have yet adopted the company ' s policy , a spokeswoman said Monday . Taco Bell ' s decision , therefore , affects more sites immediately . The company-owned locations consist_of 3 # 100 full-service eateries and 200 limited-menu outlets called Taco Bell Express . All but 400 of the company ' s 1 # 400 franchise restaurants have indicated that they will probably adopt a smoking ban , spokeswoman Janis Smith said . Last month , the Texas attorney_general sued Taco Bell , McDonald ' s and three other major chains , alleging that they endangered the health of patrons -- particularly children -- by exposing them to second-hand smoke . It was unclear Monday what effect Taco Bell ' s action would have_on the suit . Smith said the company ' s decision was not an effort to settle the suit . &quot; This is something we ' ve looked_at a long_time and something our customers want , &quot; she said . The decision followed a 12-month nationwide customer survey conducted by an independent firm , Smith said . The statistics showed that 70 % of Taco Bell customers who smoked and 84 % of customers who didn ' t favored smoke-free fast-food establishments . In addition , the survey found that 71 % of Taco Bell ' s customers are nonsmokers . Industry insiders say that the number of smoke-free restaurants will continue to grow . &quot; I think smoking bans will have virtually no effect on fast-food restaurants , &quot; said Michael Mueller , a restaurant analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco . &quot; You wait in_line , you eat , you go . And the drive-through business will be completely unaffected. &quot; Full-service restaurants , on the other hand , suffer when smoking is not allowed , Mueller said . &quot; At a restaurant where customers sit at a table for an hour or two , it really detracts from a smoker ' s pleasure not to be able to smoke. &quot; But the tobacco_industry doesn ' t think that fast-food chains can ignore smokers . &quot; Taco Bell ' s decision potentially alienates up_to 30 % or more of its customer base , &quot; said Thomas Lauria , a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute , the trade association for the cigarette industry . &quot; I can ' t think_of any business that can afford to do that , &quot; he said . &quot; There has been a concentrated effort by anti-smoking groups to pressure chain restaurants to ban smoking . It ' s not fair to their customers , who will go_to restaurants that welcome smokers. &quot; Pizza Hut , for instance , is &quot; on the cusp &quot; between fast-food and sit-down family restaurants , spokesman Rob Doughty said . Customers stay in fast-food eateries an average of 15 minutes , but they stay in Pizza Hut an average of 45 minutes , he said . Three studies showed that a no-smoking policy would hurt the company ' s business , he said . Tobacco companies are fighting_back . Philip Morris U.S.A. , the nation ' s biggest cigarette maker , and a small number of restaurant owners are pushing a ballot initiative in California to invalidate ordinances that have been adopted by more_than 100 cities , including Los Angeles , to ban smoking in restaurants . But the weight of official studies is against them . Last year , the Environmental Protection Agency officially branded secondary tobacco smoke a human carcinogen , concluding that it causes 20 % of all lung_cancers in the United States not attributed directly to smoking . The agency ' s finding sparked a spate of workplace smoking bans by employers who feared a rash of lawsuits by employees and customers . Second-hand smoke , for instance , can trigger asthma_attacks in children who suffer from that respiratory ailment , said Marian O ' Sullivan , a health educator with the American Lung Assn . of Orange County . O ' Sullivan applauded Taco Bell ' s decision . &quot; Kids love Taco Bell , so it ' s wonderful that the restaurants now will be smoke-free. &quot; Other fast-food chains are considering smoking bans . Burger King , for instance , is tracking consumer complaints through a toll-free telephone_line but hasn ' t seen a &quot; clear consensus from customers , &quot; spokesman Michael Evans said . Kentucky Fried Chicken has been conducting surveys as Taco Bell did and expects to have results within a month , spokeswoman Jean Litterst said . KFC , Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are all owned by Pepsico Inc. in Purchase , N.Y. , but set their policies separately . At Wendy ' s International Inc. , executives are concerned about related issues . The company isn ' t sure it wants to turn its employees into enforcers , and it doesn ' t want to get_into a fight with franchisees who don ' t want to go_along with a smoking ban , spokesman Mike Jenkins said . &quot; As the market gets closer and closer to deciding that a ban is what they want , we ' ll obviously start moving &quot; toward that , Jenkins said .</TEXT>
