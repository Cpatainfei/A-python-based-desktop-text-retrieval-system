   <TEXT> Interested in poultry health ? Victoriana ? The writings of Camille Paglia ? Thanks to Internet mailing_lists , you can be in constant contact with people from Paris to Perth who share the same interests.Such mailing_lists number in the thousands ; unlike the Internet ' s &quot; newsgroups , &quot; which function as forums , the material on mailing_lists comes_to you . You don ' t even need an Internet account ; almost any electronic_mail address will do . There are mailing lists for almost everybody . For scholarly discussion of schizophrenia , for instance , send e-mail to listserv.umab.bitnet with the message subscribe schiz-l ( your name ) . In fact , to join any mailing_list , you typically send a message containing the word subscribe_to an electronic postmaster , known as a listserver . Once you ' re subscribed , you ' ll receive messages from everyone on the list , and you can respond to them . Communications to list members take a different address than list housekeeping , so note the listserver address in case you want to cancel your subscription . ( Just send a message unsubscribe or signoff to the listserver. ) For a list of mailing_lists , send e-mail to listserv.bitnic.bitnet with the message list global . After an initial burst of enthusiasm , you may find it necessary to limit your subscriptions to a_couple_of lists . Some lists are echoed as newsgroups and may be easier to read that way . Also , some on-line services_charge a small fee when e-mail is received from the Internet ; check with your service before subscribing_to any mailing_list . ADAM S . BAUMAN</TEXT>
