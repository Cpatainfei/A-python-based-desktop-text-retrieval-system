   <HEADLINE> CARPENTER ' S EXTRADITION CALLED IMMINENT ; CRIME : FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HOPE TO RETURN FORMER SENATOR -- WHO FLED SENTENCING ON CORRUPTION CHARGES -- FROM COSTA RICA BY FRIDAY . HE IS SEEKING A DELAY FOR CANCER SURGERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ex-state Sen . Paul Carpenter , who fled to Costa Rica after his conviction on political corruption charges , has apparently exhausted his legal appeals and could be extradited to California by the end of the week , federal authorities said Wednesday . However , Carpenter , who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer , has asked the Costa Rican courts for a delay in his extradition , saying that he requires emergency surgery for his condition . The U.S. Marshal ' s office was preparing to pick_up the former Democratic legislator Wednesday , but because of the latest legal and medical complications held_off sending marshals to the Costa Rican capital of San Jose , where Carpenter has been jailed since April . &quot; I ' m not aware of any medical emergency , &quot; Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Mike Nelson said . &quot; I know that he wants to have an operation down there . . . to prevent the spread of the cancer . I don ' t know if the courts will allow that to happen . If it does happen , it would probably mean a delay. &quot; Earlier this week , U.S. Atty . Charles J . Stevens expressed confidence that Carpenter would finally be returned to the United States to face sentencing . Officials in Costa Rica have &quot; basically told us that this thing is over , that there is no further appeal for Carpenter , &quot; said Stevens , who was hoping that Carpenter would be returned to the United States by Friday . Stevens emphasized that the U.S._government would assure Carpenter of proper medical attention for his cancer . &quot; No one disputes the fact that he has prostate cancer at this stage and probably needs additional medical attention when he returns to the U.S. , &quot; Stevens said , adding that the U.S. prison system could provide him with better medical treatment than he has been receiving in Costa Rica . Carpenter ' s former lawyer , Charles F . Bloodgood , confirmed that the onetime California politician had exhausted his appeals in the Costa Rican courts but was asking_for a delay so that he could have surgery to treat his condition . Over the past several months , Carpenter ' s health has been precarious . He was hospitalized for six weeks when he underwent surgery to remove a benign_tumor blocking his colon , Bloodgood said . Initially , Costa Rican authorities insisted that Carpenter be handcuffed to his hospital_bed . Eventually the local courts_ordered him unshackled , ruling that handcuffing was cruel_and_unusual_punishment . The court awarded the fugitive political figure damages for the treatment , but Carpenter refused the money , Bloodgood said . Carpenter was first convicted on corruption charges in 1990 and was sentenced to 12 years in prison for extorting campaign contributions from those seeking help with legislation , including an undercover FBI_agent who was part of an elaborate sting operation . That conviction was overturned because of faulty jury instructions . However , Carpenter , a former member of the state Board of Equalization , was indicted and convicted on separate criminal charges in 1993 , along with Capitol lobbyist Clayton R . Jackson . Before he could be sentenced in February , Carpenter fled the country , leaving a note saying that he was seeking &quot; a more adventuristic &quot; treatment for his terminal cancer . In the handwritten note to federal Judge Edward J . Garcia , Carpenter explained : &quot; I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system. &quot; Soon after he arrived in Costa Rica , Carpenter was located by U.S. authorities and jailed pending his extradition . In a jailhouse interview , Carpenter told a reporter for the Sacramento Bee that he would rather die in a Costa Rican prison than be sentenced in California . &quot; You cannot go_home again , &quot; he said , &quot; even to die. &quot;</TEXT>
