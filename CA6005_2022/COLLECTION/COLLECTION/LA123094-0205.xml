   <HEADLINE> SKIING / BOB LOCHNER ; STORMS MAKE CONDITIONS IDEAL IN SIERRA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For skiers , it was a perfectly timed gift . Arriving on Christmas_Eve and continuing into the next day , the first of a series of Pacific storms added just the right layer of powder for the holiday rush to the mountains of California . Then , in midweek , more snow arrived , keeping conditions ideal . From Big Bear to Mammoth Lakes to Lake Tahoe ' s great white north , the_hills are alive_with the sound of skis hissing down slopes covered by the deepest early winter snowpack in several decades . Mammoth Mountain picked_up 14 inches of snow over the weekend and six more Wednesday , boosting its total past 100 . Nearby June Mountain , also owned by Dave McCoy , is reporting up_to 52 inches . &quot; The skiing is really spectacular , &quot; Mammoth spokeswoman Pam Murphy said . &quot; This is shaping_up as one of our biggest weeks ever . We ' ve even been getting a lot of calls from skiers who had planned to go_to Colorado , trying to make room reservations here . Unfortunately , the town is about 99 % booked. &quot; Elsewhere throughout the Sierra , the storms boosted depths to new heights , so to speak -- 156 inches at Kirkwood , 132 at Sugar_Bowl , 125 at Alpine Meadows , 120 at Squaw Valley and 102 at Heavenly , to cite a_few of the more notable measurements . Five to 10 inches fell last weekend in the Southland mountains , where Ski Sunrise and Kratka Ridge both opened on a limited basis Monday , joining Mt . Baldy , Mountain High , Snow Valley , Bear Mountain and Snow Summit , all_of which are in full operation . At Snow Summit , which has up_to 40 inches on its slopes , spokeswoman Bonnie Tregaskis said : &quot; We ' ve been selling_out of lift tickets as early as 8:30 a.m. this week , and it looks_like it ' s going_to be that way clear through the weekend -- although tickets are still presently available for each day. &quot; Ski Sunrise , near Wrightwood , is running its quad chairlift and two surface lifts at a reduced rate of $ 22 . Kratka Ridge , somewhat closer to downtown L.A. , has up_to 14 inches covering its beginners ' area , with three lifts operating at a discounted $ 15 . * After a brief holiday break , World Cup competition will resume with a women ' s slalom today at Meribel , France . However , a persistent scarcity of snow has forced cancellation of a men ' s giant slalom that had been scheduled there Thursday . Alberto Tomba of Italy , who already has piled_up 550 points , holds a substantial lead over his closest pursuers in the men ' s standings . With Michael Von Gruenigen sidelined because of a dislocated shoulder , defending champion Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway has moved_into second place at 302 , eight more_than the_Swiss racer . Heidi Zeller-Baehler of Switzerland tops the women ' s division with 485 points , 99 more_than teammate Vreni Schneider . So far , Americans have performed well in the speed events -- the downhill and super-giant slalom -- while exhibiting a chronic inability to make efficient , high-velocity turns with any regularity in the slalom and giant slalom . Eva Twardokens of Santa Cruz provided about the only glimmer of hope for the U.S. technical contingent when she finished fifth in a giant slalom last week at Alta Badia , Italy . Skiing Notes The three finalists for the 13th annual AT &amp; T Skiing Award are Diana Golden , Olympic disabled skiing gold medalist ; Phil Mahre , Olympic slalom gold medalist and three-time World Cup champion , and John Fry , editor-in-chief of Snow Country magazine and a former editor of Ski magazine .
