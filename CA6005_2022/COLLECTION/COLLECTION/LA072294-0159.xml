   <HEADLINE> SUSPECT REARRAIGNED IN 1990 PARK SLAYING ; CRIME : NATHANIEL BLALOCK AND DUNCAN MARTINEZ ARE ACCUSED IN THE KILLING OF THEIR ROOMMATE , RONALD BAKER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The case of a UCLA student whose mangled corpse was discovered more_than four years ago at a Chatsworth park inched closer to justice Thursday when a former Van Nuys man was rearraigned on murder_charges and authorities forged forward with attempts to have a second suspect extradited from Utah . Nathaniel Blalock , 26 , who pleaded not_guilty last June to a count of murder with the special-circumstance allegation of lying_in_wait , was rearraigned Thursday on an additional special-circumstance allegation of committing murder for financial_gain . Special-circumstance allegations allow prosecutors to seek the death_penalty against a defendant in murder cases . However , Deputy Dist . Atty . Anne Ingalls said that based on the facts of the case and Blalock ' s history , her office instead would seek a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole . She would not elaborate on the reasons . Blalock and co-defendant Duncan Martinez , 24 , are accused in the knife slaying of their roommate , Ronald Baker , a 21-year-old UCLA astrophysics major whose body was found in June , 1990 , near a railroad_tunnel in Chatsworth Park . Authorities have stated in court documents they believe Blalock killed Baker during a kidnap attempt designed to extort money from Baker ' s parents , but they have declined in interviews to specify what role Martinez played in the killing . A grand_jury indicted both men . Martinez , who helped police unravel the case against Blalock and ultimately himself , is fighting extradition from Salt_Lake_City , Utah , on charges identical to those against Blalock , police said . Ingalls said her office has not made a decision whether to seek the death_penalty against Martinez . The killing of Baker , who had been stabbed 18 times and whose head was nearly severed , initially prompted detectives to investigate whether his exploration of the occult had somehow gotten him killed . The tall , slender youth with curly blond hair frequently meditated in the railroad_tunnel , which had been the scene of occult activities and purported animal sacrifices , police said . Police got a break_in the case when an attorney representing Martinez contacted them in February of last year and arranged a meeting during which Martinez discussed the night of Baker ' s death and events which he said followed . Martinez also agreed to tape three conversations with Blalock that police later used to confront Blalock and get a taped confession of the stabbing from him . Blalock also told detectives during the conversation that the kidnap and extortion plot was Martinez ' s idea . Prosecutors had at one time considered charging Martinez with lesser counts or using him as a witness at Blalock ' s trial because he had cooperated with authorities . However , Ingalls said , her office decided to seek murder_charges against Martinez based on the role they believe he played in Baker ' s slaying . &quot; He was obviously very active in this case , &quot; Ingalls said . Martinez , who eulogized Baker at his funeral , was working as a waiter and attending the University of Utah at the time of his arrest . He is being held at a Salt_Lake_City jail , pending extradition to Los Angeles County where he is expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles Superior_Court . Martinez and Blalock had moved_into a Van Nuys apartment in January , 1990 , that Ron Baker ' s parents had helped their son rent the previous month , according to Katherine Baker , the victim ' s mother . Baker said her son had met Martinez , who would join the Baker family for birthdays , during his freshman year of college when they both worked_at Sears , Roebuck &amp; Co. , and that they later shared a West Hollywood apartment for about a year . &quot; I think it ' s proper that they ( Blalock and Martinez ) are both being charged because it ' s clear they were both involved , &quot; she said in an interview Thursday .</TEXT>
