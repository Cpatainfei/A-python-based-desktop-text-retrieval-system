   <HEADLINE> ASSASSINATION WITHOUT END ; GERALD POSNER TAKES_ISSUE WITH THE REVIEW OF HIS BOOK &quot; CASE CLOSED , &quot; WHICH SAYS WE ALL COULD HAVE RESTED WITH THE WARREN COMMISSION REPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jonathan Kwitny ' s review of my book &quot; Case Closed : Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK &quot; ( Book_Review , Nov . 7 ) is filled with misrepresentations of both the record and my book . It is curious that the Times selected Kwitny to review a book concluding that Oswald acted alone . He had already prejudged the assassination to be a Mafia conspiracy in his 1988 PBS special , and in the review , he charges that to espouse that the Warren Commission was right all along is the &quot; looniest JFK assassination theory of all. &quot; Kwitny reveals his bias in a number of ways . 1 -- Consider his attitude to the new technologies which have been applied to the Zapruder film , the so-called home_movie of the assassination . These techniques help to resolve the precise questions of the number of shots fired at Dealey Plaza , the timing of the shots , and whether a single bullet inflicted seven of the wounds to President Kennedy and Governor Connally . This work , presented in &quot; Case Closed , &quot; has been acknowledged in numerous reviews as a breakthrough on the case . Kwitny ' s entire discussion on the point is a sarcastic &quot; Yeah. &quot; This is frivolous . 2 -- Kwitny is misleading through selectivity . He is upset that I do not credit the testimony of Edward Becker , who casually knew New Orleans godfather Carlos Marcello . Becker claimed that in 1962 Marcello confided to him some details of a plot to kill JFK . Kwitny says that he interviewed Becker and found his story &quot; completely believable. &quot; He never informs the reader that the reason the House Select Committee on Assassinations rejected Becker ' s claim was because of his &quot; questionable reputation for honesty and ( he ) may_not be a credible source of information. &quot; Moreover , the Committee concluded that &quot; it is unlikely that an organized crime leader personally involved in an assassination plot would discuss it with anyone other_than his closest lieutenants . . . &quot; Becker claimed Marcello told him about the plot to kill JFK , at their first business meeting . The fact that Kwitny believes this discredited tale again underscores his strong prejudgment in the case . 3 -- Kwitny says that I am incorrect in_charging that the House Select Committee on Assassinations was prepared to conclude that a lone assassin had killed JFK until a last-second flip-flop caused by the mistaken acoustical conclusion that a police dictabelt contained the sounds of four , not three , shots . Instead , Kwitny says the House Committee planned months earlier to determine there was a likely mob conspiracy in the assassination . He ignores the statement of Rep . Edgar , on page 495 of the Select Committee Report , that : &quot; I agree with the Dec . 13 , 1978 first draft of our final report which states . . . that the available scientific evidence is insufficient to find that there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy . Up to that moment in the life of the committee we were prepared to go_to the American people with this conclusion. &quot; Based on its last-minute acoustical evidence , the Committee scuttled its own 600-page draft which concluded no conspiracy , and issued a nine-page summary saying there likely was one . The final report was not issued until the following year . 4 -- Kwitny charges that I &quot; am most misleading in claiming that Ruby was an underworld nobody. &quot; He then proceeds to pass along statements from uncorroborated FBI intelligence files to the effect that Ruby was involved in narcotics trafficking and had ties to leading mobsters . Kwitny himself claims that Ruby was taken before the Kefauver investigation in 1950 ( implying that he was a more prominent mobster than I indicate ) , yet that is based on the unverified claim of a single source , and there is no corroborating evidence that Ruby was ever before the committee . None of this , in any event , is relevant to the issue . Ruby could have been the godfather of one of the largest Mafia families in America , and that has nothing to do with why he killed Oswald . Kwitny may want to debate the issue on the extent of Ruby ' s mob connections , but that does not prove a conspiracy . 5 -- Kwitny also distorts the record regarding Oswald ' s supposed ties to Carlos Marcello . He greatly overplays the role and influence of Oswald ' s uncle Dutz Murret , a local gambler . There is not a shred of credible evidence that indicates that Murret introduced his nephew to any mobster in New Orleans . Moreover , Kwitny relies_on a photo of Ferrie and Oswald , when Oswald was a 15-year-old member of the Civil Air Patrol in New Orleans , to suggest that the two later had a relationship to crime boss Carlos Marcello . Even if the photo of Oswald and Ferrie is finally tested and proven not to be a fake ( as two other Oswald-Ferrie photos from the Garrison investigation were unmasked as composites ) there still is not an iota of credible evidence that show the two men had any connection some eight years later , in the summer of 1963 . 6 -- When discussing an episode in Clinton , La. , where six witnesses later claimed to have seen Oswald together with Ferrie , Kwitny says &quot; I only cite discrepancies &quot; in their statements . The reader might think these were normal disagreements among witnesses , but they are much more_than that . I uncovered previously missing documents from New Orleans District_Attorney Jim Garrison ' s late 1960s probe into the assassination which highlight serious inconsistencies . In the final analysis , historians will deem what appropriate credit &quot; Case Closed &quot; deserves in helping to resolve the outstanding questions in the assassination of JFK . Whatever that eventual resolution , Kwitny ' s distortions should not be allowed to stand uncorrected . GERALD POSNER , NEW YORK CITY Jonathan Kwitny replies : Posner ' s letter confirms my original point : while posing as a fair reporter , he is really still a lawyer , picking only those details that support his case , and withholding from the reader -- often unscrupulously -- those that don ' t . Not only was my reference_to the Warren Commission solution as &quot; loony &quot; obviously a joke , in a surfeit of care I actually labeled it in print as a joke , which shows Posner ' s unscrupulousness . About Becker , Posner supplies two quotes that , while accurate , are in a misrepresentative context . Despite Becker ' s shady background , his account -- not of a plot but of an intent -- was circumstantially corroborated : House Committee Chief Counsel , Notre Dame Law Prof . G . Robert Blakey , says so in his own book . Posner ' s whole point number 3 hangs_on the word &quot; scientific. &quot; As I wrote , in as much detail as a reviewer can , even now there isn ' t enough scientific evidence to resolve this ; in the JFK case , scientists with abundant credentials still view the same evidence and endorse contradictory conclusions ( reference also Posner ' s point number 1 ) . But more_than six months before the scientific argument erupted , the House Committee staff made a powerful case that Marcello plotted the assassination ; they based the case on records of proven telephone and travel contacts between Ruby and the Marcello organization , and strong evidence that Oswald had links to the organization ( which Posner ' s book ducks ) . Whole books , not one unverified claim , detail Ruby ' s Mafia history . When Posner denies that the committee suspected Marcello before the questionable scientific evidence surfaced , he deceives the reader ; I was there . Posner hides the fact that his featured sources on Ruby ( one of whom he won ' t disclose was a Las Vegas casino executive ) are admitted liars about the case ; for suspicious reasons , they concocted phon y stories that deflected suspicion from Ruby and Marcello . Before Posner ' s letter , my review stated that this didn ' t prove a conspiracy in the JFK assassination ; but it does prove that Posner writes misleadingly . My PBS programs on the assassination concludes that &quot; a preponderance of the evidence &quot; points to a Marcello hit . But because of so many continuing uncertainties , my programs didn ' t , and I can ' t , judge the case with nearly the finality that Posner does . My job as reviewer was to let the reader know that despite Posner ' s support from people with a vested stake in the Warren Commission findings , Posner ' s book was a one-sided lawyer ' s brief , and not a fair account . Among other readers ' responses to the review of &quot; Case Closed &quot; : It is coincidence , I suppose , that the Book_Review gives us reviews of two more books on the J.F.K. assassination in the same issue as a review of Dear Abby ' s collection of letters &quot; Where Were You When ( Kennedy Was Assassinated ) . . . &quot; ? From that day , 30 years ago , when I blindly left my house and walked , bewildered . . . I have believed everything and nothing . It does not help me , nor would I by now recognize it , to know the truth about lies_about liars . I am sure of only one thing : that nothing has been done or written in pure , disinterested search of the truth . The maze has been turned_back on itself and there is no exit . Let me alone . I am used to my grief now , and it is enough . Let the self-appointed guides wander and wonder . It has long since become a business , an industry , at its shameful best , a hobby .
