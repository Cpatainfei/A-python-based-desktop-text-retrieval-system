   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON CASE TIPSTER JAILED AFTER REFUSING TO TALK TO GRAND_JURY ; COURTS : THE MAN ' S ATTORNEY SAYS HE FEARS FOR HIS LIFE AND NOW DOUBTS THE DISTRICT_ATTORNEY ' S PROMISE OF CONFIDENTIALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A man who says he gave prosecutors a tip_in the O.J. Simpson double-murder case and now fears for his life was jailed Wednesday for refusing to testify before a grand_jury investigating Simpson ' s friend Al Cowlings . John Michael Dunton was arrested in the courtroom of Superior_Court Judge Stephen Czuleger , who last week found him in contempt after Dunton responded to a grand_jury subpoena but refused to answer questions . Dunton ' s lawyer , Robert D . Rentzer , said afterward that Dunton is willing to stay jailed for the 10 months that remain in the grand_jury term rather than divulge information that he was assured would be kept secret . Rentzer would not divulge that information or how it could endanger his client , but he emphasized that Dunton is not fearful of Simpson or anyone close to the former athlete . In a KTLA-TV interview taped weeks ago but not aired until last Thursday , Dunton said he learned secondhand that two people were involved in the June 12 slayings of Simpson ' s ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman and that a third_person may have witnessed the crime . Simpson ' s lawyers have contended that the murders could not have been carried_out by one person , as the prosecution contends . A law_enforcement source said Wednesday that although authorities have received several tips suggesting other suspects , none have panned_out . When pressed by reporters to divulge what Dunton knows , Rentzer would only say that what Dunton gave to prosecutors was non-specific and meant to &quot; point the district_attorney in the direction. &quot; Dunton considers it a breach of the confidentiality he was promised by prosecutors that he was subpoenaed before the grand_jury , his lawyer said . The panel is investigating whether Cowlings or anyone else helped Simpson try to flee police the day the football great was to surrender in the slayings . Dunton has no information on that matter , Rentzer said . The lawyer said Dunton would appeal his case to the California Supreme Court after a district court this week refused to quash his grand_jury subpoena . Meanwhile Wednesday , Santa Ana attorney William M . Walker confirmed that the football great has agreed to grant guardianship of his children to his slain wife ' s parents until he &quot; is able to resume his legal and physical custody. &quot; Sidney Brooke Simpson , 8 , and Justin Ryan Simpson , 6 , have been staying with Louis H . and Juditha Brown at their Dana Point home . Times staff writers Jim Newton and Eric Malnic contributed to this story .</TEXT>
