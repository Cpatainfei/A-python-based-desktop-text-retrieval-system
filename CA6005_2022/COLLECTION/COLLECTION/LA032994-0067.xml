   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; A NATION CLINGING TO PEACE ; TINY MACEDONIA IS SURROUNDED BY QUARRELSOME COUNTRIES AND STRUGGLING AGAINST A GREEK BLOCKADE . BUT ITS LEADERS STAY COOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was hard to imagine feeling threatened by Spase Shuplinovsky , the slightly scruffy , middle-age co-president of the Assn . for the Protection and Spreading of Truth about Alexander the Great . An eccentric , undoubtedly . But almost unbelievably , conflicting theories about a history going_back two millennia have brewed up a volatile cocktail of threats for this small , landlocked country now known to the world as the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia . Shuplinovky ' s coffee grew cold at a Skopje cafe as he argued endlessly from a heavily annotated , dog-eared Croatian translation of ancient_Greek chronicles . His thesis was that Alexander the Great was Macedonian , not a Greek . Whether he was spreading truth or delusion , he certainly hit the mark by summing_up , &quot; Balkan history cannot be digested. &quot; Neighboring tables took no notice of his talk . Few of Macedonia ' s 2 million people may have heard of Shuplinovsky or his 135-member association . But most of the majority ethnic community would agree with him that they are now ethnic Macedonians : Orthodox Christians , Slavs , but not Bulgarians or Serbs . Just Macedonians . And that is totally indigestible for neighboring Greece . The Greeks believe that the name renews Slavic claims on historic Macedonia , a large part of which is now the northern Greek province of Macedonia and populated mostly by ethnic Greeks . Athens has therefore applied maximum diplomatic pressure . On Feb . 16 , Greece defied its NATO and European allies to impose a near-total economic blockade . The resulting crisis is crippling the fragile Macedonian economy and may stoke unrest in the local ethnic Albanian Muslim minority . Some diplomats fear that any destabilization of Macedonia could suck greedy regional states into a new Balkan war just as hopes are rising for an end to the Bosnian conflict to the north . The Macedonian question , according to French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe , is still &quot; an abscess in the heart of Europe. &quot; So far , the Macedonian government has reacted with the cool that has been its trademark since 1991 , when it chose independence instead of life in the Serb-dominated rump state of Yugoslavia . Macedonia was once the poorest republic in Yugoslavia , but its careful management and civilized approach matches that of much richer Slovenia . And unlike Slovenia , the Skopje government also contrived to avoid all armed conflict with Serbia . Moderate and measured leadership by President Kiro Gligorov , a 77-year-old former Yugoslav bureaucrat , has helped keep Macedonia miraculously clear of all recent Balkan violence . &quot; The factors that could lead to a spreading conflict are very complex . So far there is nothing , &quot; Defense Minister Vlado Popovski said . But Popovski , a former law professor , knows that Macedonia has been at the crossroads of more wars than most people can count in the last century . Stiff-backed Yugoslav generals used to monitor an extraordinary three-way microcosm of the Cold_War hemming_in Macedonia : the Warsaw Pact ' s Bulgaria , NATO member Greece and Maoist Albania . Ideologies may have softened , but they and Serbia still make an awkward group of neighbors . &quot; To escape_from the claws of the hawks we may have to run . . . . We must hope that the strength of any potential attack would be balanced by other pretenders ( to our territory ) , &quot; Popovski said . His country has no other option , with what he said was an army of just 15 # 000 men , an armored brigade with no tanks and 40 air_force pilots with no warplanes . Macedonia can count_on some friends to stop it from becoming the next Balkan domino to fall . Acting with rare foresight , the United States and Western countries decided early in the Yugoslav crisis to protect Macedonia by pre-positioning U.N. peacekeepers on its border with Serbia . An initial U.S. contingent of 300 arrived last July to join a mainly Nordic battalion of 1 # 000 troops . Their number may soon rise to 500 . * Macedonians feel still stronger now that 60 countries have recognized their independence . Seven European Union states took the step_in December , and the United States followed in February , although it stopped short of establishing full diplomatic relations . A coalition government has so far papered over divisions between Macedonian Slavs and ethnic Albanians . And while Athens sponsored demonstrations against Macedonia ' s use of national symbols claimed exclusively by Greece , Skopje remained quiet . &quot; People here would rather have a beer than a fight , &quot; one local journalist said . The multiethnic atmosphere that inspired the term Salade Macedoine can still be found in the capital ' s Greek-style bars , Central European cake shops and Italian espresso cafes . The domes and minarets of a dozen Ottoman Turkish mosques rise over the low tiled_roofs of the old town . Turkish Ambassador Suha Noyan said the small remaining Turkish minority is the best-treated in the Balkans . &quot; I ' ve not seen any violent signs of nationalism . It is possible to talk_of harmony , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t live intermingled , but they live together . Unless there is outside pressure , nothing will happen here. &quot; Outside enemies can press_on two weak_points -- the Albanians and the economy , which had 229 % inflation last year . The Greek embargo could be devastating to Macedonia ' s hopes of fulfilling conditions attached_to International Monetary Fund loans it just signed . The economy was already hard-pressed by the international sanctions against its former main trading partner , Serbia . Greece will also suffer losses from the blockade it has imposed . About 500 # 000 Macedonians used to holiday on Aegean_Sea beaches in northern Greece . Port transit fees came_to $ 120 million a year , Macedonian officials say . Landlocked Macedonia is still in a tough corner . Between 50 % and 70 % of Macedonia ' s trade went_through northern Greece , including almost all_of its oil supplies . Within a week , thousands of workers were out_of_work . &quot; We didn ' t suppose this would happen , &quot; Economics Minister Petrus Stephanov said . &quot; It will be very hard . . . . Standards_of_living will decline. &quot; That could worsen relations between Macedonia ' s ethnic Slavs and Albanians . The latter are the descendants of the ancient Illyrians , who textbooks say have threatened Macedonia since the time of Philip of Macedon , father of Alexander the Great . Villages near the border are suffering from bandit-style looting raids from poverty-stricken Albania . But a worse problem is a cultural divide inside Macedonia . &quot; Albanians are the biggest real problem of Macedonia , &quot; said Zoran Popovski , the ethnic Macedonian manager of a luxury clothes shop in downtown Skopje . &quot; They smuggle , they are unemployed , they want work , schools , autonomous areas , a state within a state . They have large families . There is illegal immigration from Albania. &quot; Servet Avziu , a senior Albanian minister in Macedonia ' s coalition government , spoke carefully as he tried to explain away a growing split between impatient radicals in Albanian-dominated western Macedonia and his moderate approach . &quot; At the moment we live better ( than Albanians elsewhere in the Balkans ) because we managed to maintain the peace in Macedonia . The people in power know what peace means and the price of peace , &quot; Avziu said . Most worrying of all , he said , is a possible spillover of unrest in the ethnic Albanian province of Kosovo in neighboring Serbia . &quot; War in Kosovo means a Balkan war , &quot; he said . Until some crisis happens , Macedonia ' s balancing act will doubtless continue . Greek and Macedonian flags and coinage will go_on with a war of symbols from the ancients . A curious standoff will continue on the Greek-Macedonian border , where signs_on both sides tell visitors , &quot; Welcome to Macedonia. &quot;</TEXT>
