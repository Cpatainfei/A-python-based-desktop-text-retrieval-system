   <HEADLINE> FOOD FROM THE ' HOOD STARTS FRESH AFTER THEFT ; CRENSHAW HIGH STUDENTS LOST THEIR COMPUTERS BUT COME OUT AHEAD WITH $ 13 # 000 IN DONATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crenshaw High_School students once again are savoring the success of their Food From the ' Hood salad dressing business after thieves gave them their first sour taste of reality two weeks ago . About $ 8 # 000 worth of computer equipment , most of it donated , was stolen Oct . 5 from the company office on campus . But with the help of political and corporate allies , the students were back to business last week . The students and their business consultant quickly put_out the word that they had been hit , and in less than 48 hours donations not only paid_for the damage but put them over the top with a total of $ 13 # 000 . They also got a sleek new Food From the ' Hood van , a donation they had been anticipating but whose timing gave them a boost . &quot; It turned_out pretty good , &quot; said biology teacher Tammy Bird , who conceived Food From the ' Hood last year and works closely with students . &quot; Actually , we came_out on top overall. &quot; The fledgling company , which has been expanding rapidly and now distributes its product nationwide , lost nearly all_of its communications_equipment in the theft : two hard_drives , two keyboards , a printer , monitor , fax machine , camcorder and computer mouses . &quot; When I came_in the next morning , I knew something was wrong because I didn ' t see the computers from across the room , &quot; said senior Ben Osborne . &quot; I thought , ' Uh-oh , something ' s not right here. ' &quot; Junior Jaynell Grayson just couldn ' t believe her eyes . &quot; I thought ( business consultant ) Melinda McMullen had taken the computers out for some reason , &quot; she said . &quot; Then I saw the glass broken and it was , like , I was in shock. &quot; McMullen said that after advising local news media of the theft , she got an immediate response from 8th District Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas , who called to say he would do &quot; everything within his power &quot; to replace the lost items . Two days after the break-in , Ridley-Thomas presented the student owners of the salad dressing business with an $ 8 # 000 check from the ticket broker company TicketMaster , whose officials also were_on hand . &quot; It took one phone_call , &quot; said Ridley-Thomas , who has supported the Crenshaw student project from its inception with funds and service donations . &quot; They ( TicketMaster ) had heard of the incident and recognized the importance of helping these young entrepreneurs . Food From the ' Hood is an exemplary program . Even though they experienced losses , good can triumph. &quot; The check was just the start . One individual who heard about the theft brought_in a new fax machine to the office ; another called from Long_Beach to say that another fax machine was waiting to be picked_up by students , with his compliments , at a local Staples office supply store . The icing on the cake came from Nissan . At its annual employees ' luncheon in Carson last week , officials presented Food From the ' Hood owners with another unexpected check , this time for $ 5 # 000 . The money was in addition to Nissan ' s gift of a Quest minivan custom-painted with the colorful &quot; Food From the ' Hood &quot; logo on its sides , something that had already been in the works . The van the group had been using to transport its product to farmers markets and local stores was_on loan from RLA and due back in December . &quot; This group just embodies everything we want to support -- entrepreneurship , self-development , &quot; said Nissan spokesman Don Spetner . &quot; It ' s a great organization . They deserved it. &quot; McMullen , shouting over the sound of drilling as school district workers installed an alarm_system last week , said she and the students have been working nonstop to reload data lost in the theft -- which was everything . Students have been helping McMullen go_through shipping receipts and financial records to input information into the new and upgraded computers , which they lost no time in buying . &quot; We can ' t re-create everything , but we ' re trying , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re getting there. &quot; * FOOD FOR THOUGHT : Crenshaw teacher Tammy Bird and student Jaynell Grayson talk_about Food From the ' Hood .
