   <TEXT> The dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese yen and gained on other major currencies Monday , but stocks and bonds closed little changed from Friday . Analysts said some of Monday ' s market action appeared to be posturing ahead of the U.S. Treasury ' s quarterly &quot; refunding , &quot; which begins today with the sale of three-year notes . In New York , the dollar jumped to 101.52 yen from 100.25 yen Friday . Monday ' s close was the dollar ' s highest level against the yen since June 20 . The dollar also inched up against the German mark , to 1.583 from 1.581 on Friday . Traders said the dollar was helped on two fronts : First , some foreign investors appeared to be purchasing dollars with which to buy Treasury_notes and bonds at this week ' s auctions . Second , anticipation that the Federal_Reserve_Board will again raise short-term interest_rates may be influencing some investors ' thinking_about the dollar ' s next big move . A rise in rates would tend to support the U.S. currency . But neither stocks nor bonds got much of a lift from the dollar ' s gains Monday . The Dow Jones industrial average added 6.79 points to 3 # 753.81 in typically thin summer-Monday trading . Winners topped losers by 11 to 9 on the New York Stock_Exchange . In the bond market , the yield on the Treasury ' s 30-year bond closed at 7.54 % , unchanged from Friday . Yields had rocketed Friday after the government reported a surge in job creation in July , suggesting that the economy is stronger than the Fed desires . That raised expectations that the Fed will tighten credit soon for a fifth time this year , by boosting short-term interest_rates . The Fed ' s policy-making committee meets Aug . 16 . In the meantime , the bond market in particular faces the hurdle this week of the Treasury ' s refunding , which will dump $ 40 billion in new notes and bonds on the market . Also , both stock and bond markets may be volatile in_advance of the government ' s report on July wholesale inflation , due out Thursday , and July consumer inflation , due on Friday . Higher-than-expected inflation numbers could force the Fed to boost short-term rates by half a percentage_point , some traders say . Many economists now believe the Fed will raise rates a quarter of a point next week . Among Monday ' s market highlights : * Some industrial shares continued to decline in profit taking .

Also , Mesa Airlines plunged 3 7 / 16 to 6 9 / 16 after the regional airline lowered its 1994 and 1995 earnings expectations , citing rising competition . * On the plus side , technology issues were broadly higher .
