   <HEADLINE> PASSAGE OF PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I cannot believe that Prop . 187 passed . To what depths will we descend to find a scapegoat for the problems of our economy ? It only leads me to ask , what is next ? How about concentration_camps for all illegal aliens , and secret_police to rout_out all who are undesirable . Do all_of you think that this is the &quot; final solution &quot; to the immigrant problem in this state ? California , your ignorance is showing . EDWARD M . FLORES Altadena The people of California have overwhelmingly approved Prop . 187 . It is time for the &quot; no on 187 &quot; citizens to accept reality , initiate the will of the people and join forces to make 187 work . To complete what 187 started , our borders must be secure , illegal aliens immediately deported , and the process for legal immigration streamlined , organized and made fair and available equally to all people of all nations . Politicians who still oppose 187 will have short political careers . Organizations that mount legal battles will only increase the cost to the taxpayers that approved this measure . Unconstitutional ? If anti-187 people were concerned about the law_of_the_land , then they should define illegal immigration . Racist and anti-Latino ? What about claiming illegal acts_as justifiable if they are committed by &quot; their own , &quot; and for &quot; their own cause &quot; ? Have they forgotten about the people of the rest of the world that would also like to immigrate to the United States , but don ' t have the geographical advantage that the people of Mexico are exploiting ? SCOTT MANDELL Tarzana &quot; America ! America ! God shed his grace on thee . And crown thy good with brotherhood , from sea to shining sea. &quot; Except California . Prop . 187 is not what America is all about . J . MARTY Fullerton There is a saying that out of every bad comes a good . Prop . 187 was bad from the beginning . It promoted so_much division and ethnic hate -- our state did not need this . But my hope is that the passing of this proposition will be a wake-up call to all who were eligible to vote and didn ' t . Your vote counted last Tuesday and you were too lazy . My hope is that all_the students who demonstrated will take the voting privilege seriously and when eligible , get involved and vote . Expressing and voicing your opinion doesn ' t stop in the street -- you must voice it in the voting_booth . Don ' t be discouraged and remember , there will be more elections . Be ready and &quot; demonstrate &quot; by exercising your voting privilege . All you young people -- your numbers are massive and there is power in numbers . The &quot; brown &quot; campaign did not end with Kathleen -- it ' s up_to us now . ANGELA RANGEL CALDERA La Habra I laughed aloud this morning when I read your exit poll story ( Nov . 9 ) . To hear The Times tell it , only a minority of voters elected Pete Wilson and passed Prop . 187 . Perhaps you ' re in denial , so I ' ll help you out . This is a democracy , and the people have spoken . The voters run this country , not the media . Therefore , why don ' t you stop propagandizing , and start reporting objectively . KEVIN JACKSON Ontario Re &quot; They Kept Coming , &quot; On California , by Peter H . King , Nov . 9 : Yes , Mr. King , they kept coming -- and that is the problem precisely . They kept coming , and coming , and coming illegally to the detriment and drain of all who are here legally . MIRIAM ELPERS Simi Valley Last Wednesday , in all seriousness , my neighbor at our industrial complex asked , &quot; What are you going_to do for employees now that 187 has passed ? &quot; It took me a minute to comprehend his meaning , since he has never spoken with any of my employees , except for my foreman , who has a decided Mexican accent . My foreman , who has worked for me for 17 years , has been a legal resident for over 20 years . My other five employees are legal immigrants or U.S. citizens , but because they are of Mexican heritage , my neighbor thinks they are illegal . Such will be the case for brown-skinned people in California -- they will all be suspect . Germany had Jews for scapegoats . California has Mexicans . As an employer I must verify documentation before hiring an applicant . In all my 17 years of employing people and examining documentation , I have only once seen identification that appeared to be phony . It was a Social_Security card with a typed number on it . I told the applicant that the card was no good . He replied , &quot; That is what the lady at the window gave me , &quot; and he proceeded to show me more paperwork from the Compton SSA office . The government forces employers to be detectives and quasi-immigration officers . Prop . 187 passes that unpleasant task to teachers and doctors . It is a sad day when anger and fear make people vote for something bad in_order to send a message . I just hope Californians haven ' t cut_off their noses to spite their faces . CHRISTINE A . BREAN Gardena Once again the California voters have exercised their democratic right -- one-person , one-vote . The result has been an overwhelming and resounding &quot; yes &quot; on Prop . 187 . And once again the state and federal_courts are intent_on nullifying the majority_rule . What ' s going_on here ? The people have spoken . Illegal means &quot; unlawful. &quot; Don ' t people get_it ? The opponents of Prop . 187 have made this a racial issue . Their doctors , attorneys and educators are making big money off of illegal immigrants at the expense of the California taxpayer . I operated a polling_booth on Election_Day . It was quite refreshing to see new citizens ( Russians , Hispanics , Africans ) voting for the first time . To give illegals a safe , comfortable haven here is a slap in the face to all_of the new citizens who have paid the price to go_through the legal immigration system . JAMES HARKCOM Long_Beach There are many economic reasonings attached_to Prop . 187 and now that it has been approved , the residents of California must abide with one of the messages it has sent to illegal immigrant workers : Raise your rates . All maids , gardeners , nannies and other laborers who are working_at or below minimum_wage and without any employment-related benefits should charge their lawbreaking employers the kind of compensation that legal residents and citizens would demand for the same work . After all , the way to afford private health and education services is by earning income levels that can bear the expenses . Are Californians ready for the other side of the coin ? LUCIA M . CONFORTI Los Angeles I ' ve been in L.A. for seven years now . I ' m an illegal from France . I didn ' t think 187 would pass . So , now . . . They ' ll still let me pay my rent . They ' ll let me pay my taxes . They ' ll cut_off social_services that I never used in seven years and didn ' t even know about . I don ' t know if they will let me give my blood anymore . I go every two months to a blood_donor center . It seems they don ' t accept illegals ' blood , but I ' ll try . STEPHANN DAFRIC Beverly Hills How depressing to see so many of my fellow Hispanics rail against the &quot; racism &quot; of Prop . 187 , while simultaneously upholding the supposed interests of la raza . This is the newest and most dangerous American entitlement : having it both ways . FRANK O . GATELL-GUTIERREZ Santa Monica In reference_to &quot; Unflagging Controversy &quot; ( Nov . 10 ) , wherein Mariela Flores was quoted as justifying carrying of Mexican flags while demonstrating against Prop . 187 : I ' m trying very hard to understand . What is in her background that makes her think I was put_on this Earth to work hard , strive to improve myself primarily at my own expense , just to provide the illegals with welfare and to provide free education to her and other students in their formative years so they can demonstrate by waving the flag of a foreign nation and carry signs criticizing the policy decision of taxpayers . Is it her religious_leaders ? Is it her liberal teachers ? If she has such pride in her parent nation , she should go there to collect her free education as well as all other welfare benefits that the California taxpayers are currently providing . JACK H . FLEMING Marina del Rey In regards_to Prop . 187 , as an American , I am ashamed . My husband , who voted against Prop . 187 , said that the best ad he ' d seen in favor of Prop . 187 were the news photos of the demonstrations against it , showing dozens of Mexican flags . The Irish march and drink green beer on St . Patrick ' s Day . The Germans organize oompah bands and Oktoberfests . The Italians gave us pizza and pasta and Italian opera . Resurgent Native_American cultures add vitality and color to American mainstream culture . Everybody fawns over the_British royals when they visit . How is any of this different from the ties to a mother_country that Hispanics cherish ? My children ' s ancestors did not come_over on the Mayflower . Some came because of the potato famine in Ireland . Some came during the reign of Britain ' s Queen Victoria . Some came from the kaiser ' s Germany , before mustard_gas floated over trenches hiding future relatives from France . And darned if some didn ' t meet the boat . At some time during this country ' s history , every single group that contributed to the makeup of my children was vilified by those already established , declared &quot; idiots &quot; or &quot; drains on the public_treasury &quot; or simply &quot; savage. &quot; As a Christian , I am appalled at the ferocious lack of charity and understanding . Please show me an example when we , as individuals or as a state or as a country , have been impoverished by helping someone else ! CECELIA E . HENDERSON Cypress I believe commentators such_as Gus Frias ( &quot; America Isn ' t Colored White , &quot; Commentary , Nov . 10 ) have got_it all wrong , and they do the very people they support no great service . His reckless use of language referring to the proponents of Prop . 187 as &quot; white Europeans &quot; out against &quot; dark-skinned . . . immigrants &quot; and references_to the &quot; immoral . . . conspiracies of these confused ( white ) lunatics &quot; serves no worthwhile purpose and is not reflected in the dialogue from Prop . 187 supporters . In fact , scores of children will not be thrown_out of school , nor will our neighborhoods be threatened by the diseased . Prop . 187 has , however , sent a message to the world that California can only welcome legal immigration because that is all that we can afford . I don ' t argue with Frias ' concept of public education being a &quot; God-given right , &quot; but until God starts paying_for it , the California taxpayer must say , &quot; Sorry. &quot; JIM BLIXT Newport Beach</TEXT>
