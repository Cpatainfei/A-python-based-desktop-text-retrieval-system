   <HEADLINE> SANTA ANA ASKS FOR CAMPING LAW REVIEW ; PETITION : STATE SUPREME COURT MAY EXAMINE ORDINANCE DRAFTED TO CLEAR HOMELESS OFF CITY PROPERTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The City of Santa Ana on Friday asked the state Supreme Court to review a controversial anti-camping ordinance criticized in a state appellate_court decision as &quot; a blatant and unconstitutional infringement on the right to travel. &quot; The city drafted the 1992 ordinance to clear homeless people off city property , particularly the Civic Center plaza , which at that time was filled with makeshift dwellings . In its petition , the city says the 4th District Court of Appeal ' s decision last month &quot; completely emasculates ( the city ' s ) constitutional police power to regulate and maintain public_property for the benefit of the public at large. &quot; The court has 90 days to decide whether to hear the case , said Assistant City Atty . Robert Wheeler , who filed the petition Friday . The American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities , a Washington-based group that is an advocate for the rights of cities , also filed a letter Friday with the state Supreme Court urging it to hear the Santa Ana case , said Mike Schroeder , the group ' s attorney in Santa Ana . &quot; We argue that you can ' t take_a_look at the issue of the rights of the homeless in isolation , &quot; Schroeder said . &quot; If you take_away the parks and the public areas , you are disenfranchising and taking_away the rights of another group . We argue that those rights should be considered. &quot; William Wise , an attorney for the Legal Aid Society , which challenged the ordinance , said he thinks the case is specific to Santa Ana and that it therefore would not be appropriate for the higher_court to hear . &quot; Justice ( Thomas F. ) Crosby ( Jr. ) made his decision specific to the way Santa Ana has treated its homeless , &quot; Wise said of the appellate ruling . &quot; He spends a lot of time talking_about the history of Santa Ana , beginning with homeless sweeps in 1988 , and the taking of possessions from the homeless . There are a series of actions that predate this ordinance and indicate the city ' s hostility toward the homeless. &quot; Crosby ' s decision also said the ordinance would &quot; turn the county jail into a poorhouse and thus . . . destroy liberty. &quot; While the 4th District Court of Appeal was considering the_matter in December , the city drafted another anti-camping ordinance that was narrower in scope , dealing specifically with the Civic Center area . The Legal Aid Society has challenged that ordinance as well and the_matter will be heard in Orange County Superior_Court in August , Wise said .</TEXT>
