   <TEXT> The restaurant seemed strangely familiar : A Los Angeles Times news rack was nestled next to the front_door , the Raiders were playing_on the large-screen televisions overhead and yuppies at the bar munched buffalo_wings and &quot; Dodger Dogs. &quot; The menu offered Rodeo Drive nachos , Santa Monica clam_chowder and a Wilshire vegetarian club_sandwich . The ambience seemed straight out of Melrose Avenue ; the blond furniture suggested a tony Encino bistro . But barely visible , past the neon signs_in the polished plate_glass , loomed the Bank of China building -- an unmistakable Hong Kong landmark . Welcome to L.A. Cafe , a new restaurant_chain , which is doing booming business by selling a slice of California to Asia . &quot; This would n ' t work in L.A. , where it ' s old hat , &quot; said J.R. Robertson , an expatriate American insurance executive who founded the restaurant a year ago . &quot; We ' re selling the L.A. lifestyle , which seems exotic here . Asians are throwing_away the values of older generations and this kind of place is different from anything they are used to. &quot; While American gourmets increasingly experiment with the foods of Thailand , Vietnam , Indonesia and even Myanmar , Asian diners , especially in the prosperous crescent from Taipei to Jakarta , have fallen head over heels in_love with American food -- from Big Macs to Haagen-Dazs . In fact , when fast-food franchiser McDonald ' s opened its first restaurant in Singapore in 1982 , it quickly became the biggest selling McDonald ' s in the world . Now , eight of the world ' s top 10 selling McDonald ' s are in Asia , seven of them in Hong Kong and one in Beijing . Take a stroll down Bangkok ' s Silom Road and you might think you have been transported to a suburban American shopping_mall : McDonald ' s , Pizza Hut , Swensen ' s Ice_Cream and a Sizzler Steak House anchor one side of the avenue , facing Arby ' s and Burger King on the other . Tony Roma ' s , a Dallas-based franchise chain that specializes in ribs , opened its doors in Singapore a year ago and has a line around the block every night . With only 130 seats , it sells 800 meals a day . Franchised by Indonesian entrepreneurs , Tony Roma ' s has expanded to Hong Kong and Jakarta , where every month it manages to sell a 20-foot container-load of pork ribs in the world ' s largest Muslim country ; 15 more branches are to open in the region in the next three years . &quot; Business is just terrific ; it ' s unreal , &quot; said Karl Faux , an Austrian hotelier who oversees Tony Roma ' s operations in Southeast_Asia for franchise owner Mas Millenium . &quot; Anything that is American is really hot right now. &quot; Like Tony Roma ' s , some American companies have found success by selling food that is familiar to Asian tastes but is presented in an unusual setting . Pork ribs , after all , have been a mainstay of the ethnic Chinese diet for thousands of years . Another company that is advancing in Asia is Kentucky Fried Chicken , now a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc. and renamed simply KFC with &quot; the colonel &quot; demoted to a peripheral role . Tim Lane , KFC ' s president for Asia , said that in the last four years , the number of its chicken restaurants in Southeast_Asia has shot from 250 to 600 ; the Japanese market has grown from 600 to 1 # 000 . Thailand , where there were none as recently as 1989 , has 50 KFC outlets . &quot; Chicken is a great concept for Asia because it ' s familiar and there are no health or religious issues , &quot; Lane said . &quot; We ' re selling Americana and your slice of it . We ' re concentrated in areas with folks with rising incomes. &quot; While rents are often higher in Asia ' s congested cities than in the United States , increased business more_than compensates . Lane said that while the typical KFC restaurant in America does $ 200 # 000 a month in business , the average outlet in Asia rakes_in $ 750 # 000 . One man who successfully challenged the conventional wisdom that food has to be familiar to succeed in Asia is Bill Heinecke , an American who grew_up in Thailand . When he proposed opening a Bangkok Pizza Hut in 1982 , potential investors told him he had lost his marbles ; even the franchiser was dubious . Asians , they said , are notorious for hating cheese -- and pizza uses lots of it . But Heinecke is the one who is laughing these days . He just opened his 50th Pizza Hut in Thailand and is christening a new restaurant every 15 days . His company also just opened Thailand ' s first factory to make cheese , cranking_out 36 tons of mozzarella a month . &quot; Everybody thinks the world is_full of different people , &quot; Heinecke said in an interview . &quot; But people are more similar than dissimilar . People haven ' t given_up eating Thai food , but a secretary in an Esprit skirt is no longer willing to pull_up a stool at a noodle stall . It ' s now considered part of the modern lifestyle to be seen in a fast-food restaurant. &quot; The ever-inventive Heinecke has capitalized on Bangkok ' s notorious traffic by hiring 500 motorcycle delivery_boys and promising a pizza delivery in 30 minutes , despite the gridlock . Most of his new restaurants don ' t even have tables and chairs but are simply kitchens and take-out windows . Daniel Ng , a chemical engineer who became a millionaire as the Hong Kong franchise owner for McDonald ' s , recalled that in the early 1980s , many people warned him against entering the fast-food business . &quot; Chinese won ' t eat hamburgers , &quot; he recalled being told by friends . &quot; How can you do market research with food nobody had ever heard of in an ambience no one knew ? &quot; Ng now owns 72 McDonald ' s in Hong Kong , three in China and has a one-third interest of the franchise in Singapore . Two factors seem to have helped speed American food into Asia during the last few years . First , the region is growing substantially richer , thanks to an economic boom that began in the early 1980s and has sustained growth_rates of 8 % to 10 % a year in many countries . That translates as rapidly rising salaries for many urban workers . &quot; Basically , all_the Asians are getting discretionary income making the widgets we are importing , &quot; said the L.A. Cafe ' s Robertson . Secondly , the region is not only getting richer but growing older . &quot; A maturing Thai population will provide demographic support for a fast-food boom into the next century , &quot; said a study by Smith New Court , a stock brokerage company , which quoted census figures showing that 70 % of the population is younger than 30 . &quot; Combined with increasing upward mobility in this dynamic sector , consumer spending will continue its current up-trend. &quot; One thing that sets Asia apart from other regions is the relative strength of its families . Food outlets with the strongest appeal_to families with_children seem to have the most success . McDonald ' s in Hong Kong staged 18 # 000 birthday_parties last year for 500 # 000 children . Singapore ' s franchise owner paid_for a weekly television_show hosted by a Chinese version of Ronald McDonald , the restaurant ' s trademark clown . &quot; Much more_than in the United States , we ' re very kid-oriented in Asia , &quot; KFC ' s Lane said . Most major restaurant operators try to keep their menus identical with the American market and import food from America when no local substitutes can be found . Tony Roma ' s coleslaw comes from Dallas ; KFC ' s chicken comes from the United States and Australia . Some have found , however , that Asian tastes differ : In Thailand , Pizza Hut puts pineapple on some of its pizzas and hot_sauce on the tables ; KFC offers a &quot; hot and spicy &quot; version of the old standby for Asians accustomed to piquant food . Burger King found that Thais , most of whom are Buddhists , weren ' t snapping_up beef burgers and found a niche by promoting chicken_sandwiches . McDonald ' s countered by offering fried chicken , which is not available at American outlets . &quot; It took a while to get a handle on the market , &quot; conceded Stephen Hunt , an American executive who works for the Central Group , Burger King ' s franchise owner in Bangkok . &quot; What we didn ' t realize at the time was that apparently a large segment of the market doesn ' t eat beef . We were advertising products with a limited appeal. &quot; When McDonald ' s opens in India , now expected in about three years , beef Big Macs won ' t even be_on the menu because of the Hindu reverence for the cow . &quot; We haven ' t decided yet what will be there , but it will probably involve chicken , &quot; said Mike Gordon , director of communications for McDonald ' s Inc. American marketers also had to rethink strategies to accommodate cultural differences . The Hard Rock Cafe , for example , was a big success in Singapore and Jakarta , but stumbled in Thailand . For one thing , Thai customers were offended by the Hard Rock ' s legendary friendly waiters , who were encouraged to sit with the customers to take their orders , said James Choong , financial director of the restaurant . Thais were not used to sitting with servants . Another complication was the name -- many Thais considered a &quot; cafe &quot; a euphemism for a brothel . The company stuck_with its name , but got its waiters to take orders in more formal fashion -- standing up ; business is slowly improving . Similarly , a Hong Kong-based restaurant_chain called Dan Ryan ' s Chicago Bar and Grill , which tries to evoke the image of an old Midwestern steak house , faced a negative image in Singapore because families would normally never go_to a &quot; bar &quot; to eat . One American chocolate_chip_cookie company encountered a hostile market because the gourmet treats were simply too expensive for local pocketbooks , even with the region ' s greater affluence . The invasion by American food also has not been universally welcomed in Asian_countries , many of which view with suspicion any hint that American values are being imported to their relatively conservative countries . &quot; We should not be swayed by the trend towards eating non-rice food , including Western food , &quot; Indonesia ' s vice_president Try Sutrisno warned in a speech last September . He said Indonesians should go_back to eating traditional food that requires &quot; more chewing. &quot; But , so far , there have been few local efforts to repulse the American onslaught . One Thai restaurant_chain , S &amp; P , has started offering Thai food in a Western fast-food type setting . A number of local fast-food efforts in the region have failed , however , because American brands are so well-known and the chains achieve tremendous economies of scale by buying_in bulk . Satit Niyomyart , dean of sociology at Bangkok ' s Thammasat University , said he believes that Western food has become popular in Thailand because so many Thais have studied in the United States . There are 200 # 000 Thais in California alone , he noted . &quot; It ' s a phenomenon of the past 15 years , &quot; Satit said . &quot; Young Thais are trying to become Westernized . These lifestyle changes are worrying . People are gaining weight and getting fat . That never used to happen. &quot; One big change wrought by the shift toward a Western diet is that young Asians are getting bigger than their parents , with average height and weight ratios much higher for the young . A study of young people published in Singapore last month showed that , on average , 18-year-old boys weighed 120 pounds in 1983 and 137 pounds in 1993 . Girls added 2.5 pounds , on average . Because fast food is so new_to the region and its clientele is so young , restaurant owners have yet to hear many concerns expressed about the healthfulness of their fare . In part , they suspect that Asian families are eating fast food only occasionally and don ' t have to start worrying about fat in their diet as do their American counterparts . As for the future of the industry , almost all_of the restaurant executives interviewed believed that they have only scratched the surface of fast food in Asia . &quot; If anything , the growth will be accelerated , &quot; said Gordon of McDonald ' s , who noted the chain is adding 1 # 000 restaurants a year outside the United States and doubling its presence in China next year . &quot; There ' s a lot of opportunity and potential in the Asian market. &quot; Cerebos Pacific , which holds the franchise for Pizza Hut in Singapore and Malaysia , is adding 15 restaurants in the next few months . It reported a $ 56-million profit last year . Even on the day last week that President Clinton lifted the American trade_embargo against Vietnam , McDonald ' s received inquiries about the possibility of opening restaurants in Asia ' s newest market . But Gordon said there were &quot; no plans to go_into Vietnam . . . yet. &quot;</TEXT>
