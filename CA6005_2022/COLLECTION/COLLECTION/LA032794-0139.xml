   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : PINING FOR A BIT OF THE OLD ULTRA-VIOLENCE ? BLAME MICHAEL MEDVED -- BETTER YET , DON ' T</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Has Michael Medved single-handedly shamed Hollywood into cleaning_up its act ? So one might conclude from the cover of last weekend ' s supplement carried by more_than 400 newspapers , which showed a beaming Medved seated beneath posters for &quot; Sleepless in Seattle , &quot; &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and &quot; The Age of Innocence. &quot; &quot; On the eve of Monday ' s Oscars , &quot; the USA Weekend cover line proclaimed , &quot; the critic who took_on the movie_industry says : ' Hollywood Got the Message ' . &quot; Medved , who reviews films for public television and the New York Post , contended in the article that filmmakers have &quot; started to make a serious effort to reconnect with the values of ordinary Americans &quot; in part because of the overwhelming public response to published excerpts from his controversial 1992 book , &quot; Hollywood vs . America. &quot; The book -- widely criticized within the industry as simplistic and moralistic -- attacked the notion that sex and violence sell tickets and accused the movie_industry of engaging in self-destructive behavior by steadily increasing the percentage of R-rated releases . As evidence that Hollywood is now buying his argument , Medved cites such 1993 PG-13-rated releases as &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and &quot; The Fugitive &quot; and the PG-rated &quot; The Age of Innocence. &quot; Praising &quot; The Fugitive &quot; for its restraint , he speculated that had the Oscar-nominated thriller &quot; appeared a_few years ago , it might well have been an R-rated bloodbath full of dismemberment and crude macho language. &quot; Not so , according to Arnold Kopelson , the producer of &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; which , like Medved ' s other examples , was in development years before &quot; Hollywood vs . America &quot; was published . &quot; ' The Fugitive , ' as it appeared on screen this past year , is precisely the film that we always intended it to be , &quot; Kopelson said through a spokeswoman . He refrained_from attacking Medved directly , but others did not . &quot; I have never met a film critic who would so shamelessly suggest that his or her opinions influenced the direction of the film_industry , &quot; said John Powers , who reviews movies for New York magazine . &quot; The only film critic who thinks he has any power is Michael Medved. &quot; Said Newsweek ' s David Ansen : &quot; He ' s patting himself on the back and taking credit for something that I ' m not sure has even occurred. &quot; Medved himself notes that in 1993 , 61.2 % of all rated films got an R -- a 3 % increase over 1991 . Both critics acknowledged that Hollywood is showing new interest in family films , but they said this trend was inspired more by studio executives ' experiences raising children than by outside pressure . &quot; They ' ve wised up_to the fact that there ' s an audience for these films , &quot; Ansen said . In a telephone_interview , Medved described himself as &quot; one participant among many in the ongoing debate which has begun to shift the industry. &quot; &quot; The ( headline ) says ' Hollywood Got the Message. ' It doesn ' t say , ' Hollywood Got My Message , ' &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s any suggestion that I single-handedly changed things . I was just one of many voices raised in this cause over a long period of time. &quot;</TEXT>
