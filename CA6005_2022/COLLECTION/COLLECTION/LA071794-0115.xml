   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; BRITAIN ADJUSTS TO ITS NEW ' SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is our own fault . We Brits have picked and worried at this old scab of the &quot; special relationship &quot; until President Bill_Clinton mercifully stepped_in to stop the bleeding and save us from our own foolish myths and self-inflicted wound . In Bonn last week , Clinton dispatched the_British concept of the Anglo-American partnership to the mists of the sentimental past , and embraced America ' s new intimacy with Germany . Quite right , too , from Clinton ' s point_of_view . It is not just that financially and industrially , Britain is no longer even in the upper-middle classes of the global pecking_order . It is that , with the end of the Cold_War , the United States no longer needs the_British Isles as an unsinkable aircraft_carrier and provider of reliable diplomatic and military cannon_fodder . For the past 50 years , we have been America ' s white Gurkhas , loyal , gallant , little folk of quaint warlike ways , ready to do the bidding of the Yankee Sahib . Atomic air_bases and nuclear submarine facilities ? At your disposal , dear boy . Overflight rights to conduct President Ronald Reagan ' s diplomacy-by-airstrike ? Don ' t bother to ask , old chap . A usefully located British dependency in the West Indies to decant Haitian refugees away from U.S. shores ? The Turks and Caicos will do nicely . We did our military bit , and not only in the Gulf War , but also with the_British Army on the Rhine , the armored divisions of which were the backbone of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s defenses on the North German plain . In 1964 , when Lyndon B . Johnson ' s new Administration tentatively suggested that some token British presence might be helpful in Vietnam , he was reminded that , after defeating the communist insurgency in Malaya , and still fighting a low-intensity war in Borneo , Britain had more troops in Southeast_Asia than the United States did . We tried hard_to_please , but the game is up . One sure sign is_on CNN daily . In the currency-news roundup of the state of the dollar , the yen and deutsche_mark are the currencies that matter . The pound_sterling has gone the way of the equally devalued Sterling , the last British family car we tried to market in the States . We have gone_through a series of self-deluding metaphors to protect and comfort ourselves against the cold reality of our declining status in American eyes . Fifty years ago , when John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White drew_up the blueprint for the postwar financial order at Bretton Woods , the dollar and the pound_sterling assumed equal status as the world ' s two reserve currencies . More_than 30 years ago , Prime_Minister Harold Macmillan mused about our being Greeks to the American Romans , the civilized and cultured slaves who really ran the Empire . Then , in that last and gloriously flaring supernova of the old alliance -- as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher went arm-in-arm against the Evil Empire -- the image changed . We became the wise and keen-eyed Tonto to the American Lone Ranger , with our special forces always ready to creep stealthily through some foreign undergrowth , and our diplomacy available to explain the Lone Ranger ' s brusque ways to wary tribesmen . The most compelling image , however , has always been of the Americans as Don Quixote , with Britain as plump little Sancho Panza , trotting loyally alongside , occasionally plucking fretfully at his master ' s sleeve to suggest that some windmills are not for tilting . But now that the Russians have taken the common enemy away , and Don Quixote has returned to the rickety ancestral home to consider domestic renovations , Sancho Panza is surplus to requirements . Matters of such gravity concerning the national interest go_far beyond any personal coolness in the relations between Clinton and Prime_Minister John Major . Though the low esteem in which British interests are held was signaled by the visa granted to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams earlier this year , it is the underlying relations of states rather than surface bickerings of elected and temporary leaders that is driving the U.S. policy . And if Sancho Panza has any sense , he will realize Clinton has done him a favor , sluicing away the befogging illusions of the past with a bracing douche of reality . Clinton ' s embrace of Germany in a &quot; truly unique relationship &quot; was rooted in his belief that a fully integrated Europe is the crucial institution to stabilize the traditionally turbulent old Continent . As the economic powerhouse of that Europe , and the nation most committed to the investments and trade that can draw Eastern Europe into the prosperity of the West , Germany is the essential vehicle for Clinton ' s grand design . As the grumpily recalcitrant island that tries to stall the process of European integration , Britain is not only less and less relevant to U.S. interests , but is starting to antagonize them . With its strategic utility to the United States declining , Britain has found a new niche , living like a parasite off the long equivocation that has bedeviled America ' s policies toward Europe . Unsure whether it feared a rich united Europe as a trade and possible strategic rival , or desired it as stabilizing democratic grouping to share the burdens of global management , the United States , under Clinton , has finally made_up its mind . The German friendship is the path to the kind of Europe America now wants . The traditional special relationship with Britain would perpetuate U.S. dithering , an Anglo-Saxon mutual insurance_policy against a Europe that might one day grow_into a Frankenstein monster . Under their breath , the_British have a phrase for this , and at least one minister has been forced to resign for referring to &quot; the Fourth Reich &quot; in public . Thatcher , most certainly , was against it and , like so many of her countrymen locked_in mystic memories of D-day , trusted too_much and too long in U.S. devotion . The little Englanders are right to say the emerging Europe will be a German-led Fourth Reich . But they are thumpingly wrong to assume this will echo the Third one . The point about the new Europe is that it will be what all_of us , British and French , Italians and Spaniards , Greeks and , probably soon , Finns and Swedes , will make of it . We all understand the need to tame the historic German beast . We also understand the need to provide a European answer to the German question . And now , at last , America ' s white Gurkhas have been given their liberty , set_free by Clinton ' s unsentimental decision to squash the old illusion , and force us to face the new challenge . Not only will we be of more use to America that way , we will be more use to ourselves and to our fellow Europeans . A generation ago , Dean Acheson warned that Britain had &quot; lost an empire , and not yet found a role. &quot; Now we have one : to ensure that Europe ' s Fourth Reich is equally what the_French can see as an entente_cordiale , the Brits embrace as a commonwealth , the Italians join as a Risorgimento and , perhaps , even one day what the Russians call semya , a family . If we Brits can finally put aside the humiliating role of Sancho Panza , and aspire again to the leading role of Don Quixote in building such a Europe , that is a windmill worth a tilt . And if Brits and Americans can join in that adventure , that will be the real triumph of a special relationship that has , in all other respects , outlived its usefulness. *</TEXT>
