   <TEXT> Porridge and potatoes . Potatoes and porridge . Mashed potatoes diluted into a watery gruel . Thin porridge cooked with water instead of milk . The winter of 1993 was long and bitter . On a bleak Russian air_force base deep in the Ural Mountains , 20-year-old recruit Vladimir German was slowly starving . &quot; Hunger haunted me for the first two months in the army , and then I got used to it somehow , &quot; German said . &quot; But still I was not getting enough food. &quot; One desperately hungry December day , German and his buddies caught and ate a stray dog . &quot; We thought , what the heck , half the planet eats dog meat . . . . What harm will it do if a Russian eats it once in his life ? &quot; German said . &quot; We understood that this was probably our last chance not to starve to death. &quot; Their fears were not exaggerated . A month later , on Russky Island in the Far East , four sailors died of starvation and at least 86 others were hospitalized with illnesses stemming from severe malnutrition . Recruits who survived were reported to be more_than 66 pounds underweight . The incident prompted President Boris N . Yeltsin to sack the commander of the Pacific Fleet . The military said the Russky Island incident was isolated , but hunger apparently is not . German finished his mandatory military_service this spring and came_home , his mother says , &quot; looking_like a walking corpse. &quot; His advice to the thousands of young_men who are now desperately trying to avoid being drafted into the Russian army : &quot; Do whatever you can to wiggle out of it . You should go serve only on one condition : if your goal in life is to become a dumb invalid. &quot; Although Russia is at_peace , young_men are dodging the draft in far greater numbers and with a determination not seen even when young Soviet soldiers began coming_home from Afghanistan in coffins . The Bolsheviks proclaimed the army to be indivisible from the people , and for 70 years the Red Army was one of the most respected institutions in the Soviet_Union . A recent poll showed that citizens still trust the army more_than they do their president , their Parliament or the Russian Orthodox Church . But today 70 % of draft-age men think military_service is unnecessary , and 35 % say they are prepared to leave Russia to avoid the draft , according to data cited with dismay by Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev . Tens of thousands of young_men are voting with their feet . And a surprising number of their fathers support them . Though deeply proud_of their own military_service , many men feel that the army that defeated Adolf Hitler is no longer an honorable institution that will teach their sons to be men . It is not uncommon to hear the father of a teen-age boy reminisce fondly about his own army stint , yet swear to do whatever it takes_to keep his son from serving . This spring , Yeltsin ordered that 216 # 000 young_men be drafted into an army that will number below 2 million by the end of the year , down from a peak of 5 million in Soviet days . Military officials say they are having no trouble mustering the required number of recruits , though some experts say draft dodging and desertion have in fact thinned the army ' s ranks . Reports of increasingly harsh tactics to round_up conscripts , including cancellation of some student deferments and 5 a.m. raids on draft_dodgers ' homes , indicate that fewer young_men are willing to perform their 18 months to two years of mandatory military_service . Officially , the army registered 41 # 500 draft_dodgers in 1993 , or nearly one for every five men drafted . But the real_number is certainly far higher , as men ages 18 to 27 struggle frantically to get student deferments or bribe doctors with up_to $ 5 # 000 to certify them unfit to serve . Some hide_out with friends and relatives . Their motives are varied . Many have heard horrifying tales of cruelty in the army , ranging from dreadful living conditions to brutal hazing that can lead to crippling injuries , gang rape or murder of young recruits . According to the Russian military prosecutor ' s office , 169 servicemen died in hazing incidents in 1993 . The deaths are blamed on a general lack of discipline , ethnic tensions in the army and in particular on the tradition of dedovshchina , or bullying of new recruits by second-year soldiers . Young_men cite fear of dedovshchina as a major reason for dodging the draft . Other draft evaders , emboldened by the end of Soviet rule , do not want to serve in an army they believe may yet be used as an instrument of political repression , at_home or in the neighboring former Soviet republics . And some young_men are avoiding military_service now simply because they can get_away with it amid the general chaos in Russian society that has accompanied the dismantling of totalitarianism . According to the Defense Ministry , of the 41 # 500 dodgers on file_in 1993 , only 470 were convicted of draft evasion , a crime punishable by up_to five years in prison . As young Russians search for spiritual meaning in the vacuum left by the demise of the Communist_Party , some have turned_to religion . A growing number of draft_dodgers are pacifists or have religious_beliefs they say prevent them from bearing arms . And , in a dramatic shift in attitude from Soviet times , a striking number of people here in the Russian heartland believe Russia should abandon the draft and shift to an all-volunteer , professional army . The stories told by the young soldiers who have recently returned to Chelyabinsk help explain why . For Dmitri Medvedyev , the problem with the army was not the food or the guns , but the beatings . Night after night , a group of second-year soldiers would pounce on a sleeping new recruit , curse and humiliate their victim and then beat him , sometimes savagely , while the duty officer in the next room pretended not to hear . Skinny , handsome and bookish , Dmitri showed_up nearly every morning with bruises . After four months , he deserted and went_home . Officers came and brought him back and promised that the culprits would be punished . But the beatings only got_worse . &quot; Those who could put_up with it did , and the rest just broke , &quot; he said . &quot; I guess I broke. &quot; He deserted twice more , hiding out at his grandfather ' s home . His mother , Zinaida Medvedyev , 45 , said police often telephoned or pounded on the door in the middle of the night , demanding to know Dmitri ' s whereabouts . Dmitri was finally discharged only after his mother brought military authorities a medical certificate showing that he had undergone surgery to repair a kidney that was damaged as a result of the beatings . Dmitri , now 21 , described his military_training with contempt : &quot; I held a gun once , and that was all. &quot; Mostly , he said , he did janitorial work and unloaded trucks . &quot; The army is nothing but a system for free labor , &quot; he said . Defense Ministry officials in Moscow said they are trying by all means possible to eliminate hazing . If so , the message has not penetrated even through the top army brass . The military commander of the Chelyabinsk region , Maj . Gen . Alexander A . Fedik , said he thinks hazing &quot; is maybe not even a problem . It ' s talked_about more_than it really happens. &quot; Asked about the Medvedyev beatings , Fedik said : &quot; Maybe there was such a case . I don ' t know . But this could happen on the street , in a disco , in a restaurant . . . . It also happens in the American army. &quot; Hazing does exist in the U.S. military , but it is rarely lethal . Pentagon spokesman Col . Doug Hart said he was not aware of any deaths due_to hazing last year , although 85 service personnel were victims of homicide . Last year , 2 # 572 Russian servicemen of all branches died in noncombat situations , according to the military prosecutor ' s office , out of a force of roughly 2.2 million . That rate is about 64 % higher than in the U.S. military , where 1 # 244 Army , Air_Force , Navy and Marine Corps personnel died_out of a force of about 1.75 million . The Committee of Russian Soldiers ' Mothers , a group formed in 1989 to expose and combat brutality in the military , says the official Russian death statistics are probably understated . After five years of struggle , the families of slain and injured soldiers have finally managed to publicize what they say is an unacceptably high rate of peacetime deaths and injuries . Last month , the Russian Parliament took the unprecedented step of summoning a top general to testify on the problem . The officer , Deputy Chief of the General_Staff Lt . Gen . Anatoly Bogdanov , told lawmakers that most of the 518 deaths in the first_half of 1994 were_due to safety violations , but 8 % were murders , 27 % suicides and 5 % were caused by barracks violence , or dedovshchina . In an interview at Defense Ministry headquarters in Moscow , Maj . Gen . Vasily V . Smirnov said the army ' s problems are grossly exaggerated by the Committee of Russian Soldiers ' Mothers . He said the army only reflects the increase in violence and crime plaguing Russian society in_general . Smirnov said other top officials say they feel the honor of the Russian army is being undermined by an incessant barrage of bad press . In a nation that still prides itself on having won World_War_II , plenty of people agree . Some are saddened by the army ' s loss of glory and prestige , while others think draft_dodgers are scum .</TEXT>
