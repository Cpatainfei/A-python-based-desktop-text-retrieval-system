   <HEADLINE> EYE IN THE SKY ; TECHNOLOGY : MILITARY SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM POISED FOR COMMERCIAL BOOM . CALIFORNIA COULD WIN BIG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Pentagon is awash in obsolete nuclear bombs , mothballed battleships and surplus military bases , but out of the scrap heaps left by the Cold_War has come a technology with a promising payoff . When the Defense_Department laid plans in the 1970s for its Global Positioning System , a network of 24 satellites that broadcasts navigation signals to users on Earth , it was intended to help soldiers fight anywhere , from jungles to deserts . Along the way , though , commercial interests saw a potentially lucrative concept that could revolutionize industries such_as land surveying , trucking , environmental protection and farming . The technology , now poised to leap into virtually every facet of the American economy , is expected to create a $ 5-billion to $ 10-billion industry by the end of this decade and more_than 100 # 000 jobs . With a special receiver that taps the satellite signals , civilian users can determine their position by latitude and longitude within 100 meters ( 328 feet ) anywhere in the world . Once as big as a file_cabinet , the receivers are now the size of a paperback book and still shrinking . Consumer models , used by wilderness backpackers , cost as little as $ 500 . Some visionaries anticipate the day when virtually everything that moves_in U.S. society -- every shipping container , aircraft , car , truck , train , bus , farm tractor and bulldozer -- will contain a microchip that will track and , in many cases , report its location . Massive computer_systems , they say , will tie together the movement of assets in the economy , providing a sophisticated information_system for the status and location of goods . California has quietly come_to dominate the new field , much as it did the personal_computer industry in the early 1980s . A third of the world ' s GPS equipment manufacturers , including the dominant firms in the industry , are in California , according to recent industry surveys . Assuming California can hold its position , it stands to gain a major share of the new jobs . And while the state is desperate for growth , the benefits of the GPS industry have gone largely unheralded , in part because the defense industry bust has overshadowed GPS . Such new firms as Magellan Systems in San Dimas , Trimble Navigation and Ashtech in Sunnyvale and ESRI in Redlands dominate the commercial business and are growing at 20 % to 40 % annually . Meanwhile , the California operations of Rockwell International and Magnavox are top players in the defense market . The federal_government set the stage for this commercial growth merely by guaranteeing civilian access . In one of his lesser-known but farsighted decisions , President Ronald Reagan decreed in 1983 that the system would be free to the public , rejecting bureaucratic calls_for a cumbersome toll system . The navigation system is among a handful of advanced military technologies -- ranging from spy_satellites to plastic composite_materials -- that hold_out potential for commercial development . Yet , whereas defense conversion in_general remains uncertain , GPS is clearly the best example of military technology moving from the battlefield to the marketplace . &quot; Communications satellites were the first great success in space , but GPS is going_to dwarf that , &quot; said Albert Wheelon , a former Hughes Aircraft chairman and an early pioneer in commercial space . &quot; GPS is going_to pervade everything we do. &quot; The satellite navigation system was expected to have civilian applications , but the market has turned upward dramatically in the last twoyears as costs have declined , according to Stephen Colwell , president of a consulting_firm in Sunnyvale . By later this year , a satellite_receiver may be boiled_down to just three computer chips costing about $ 100 per set ; eventually , the price will drop below $ 50 , Colwell said . At that point , GPS would be inserted into a lot of other electronic gear , such_as cellular_telephones that could instantly alert police to an individual ' s location in an emergency . &quot; There are a_million deals going_on , &quot; Colwell said . &quot; It is seldom you see a new technology coming_on so rapidly. &quot; Indeed , use of the system is expanding quickly . Computerized maps are being used to track the spread of disease , pollution and crime , based on data collected from GPS systems . Hamburger chains pore over these kinds of computer-generated maps to determine the best sites for new franchises . Interstate truckers use the system to keep tabs of their road taxes . Commercial fishermen use the system to return to fertile fishing holes . It has led to important advances in the study of earthquakes , allowing geologists to measure in inches how far temblors move land masses . Cities use the satellite system to dispatch emergency vehicles and track the location of passenger buses . Railroads are finally able to figure_out where their trains are . &quot; Every month , every week , there is somebody who comes_up with a unique new way to use this , &quot; said Jules McNeff , the Pentagon ' s key technical and policy expert on GPS . &quot; Its uses will be limited only by people ' s imagination. &quot; Orbiting 11 # 000 miles above Earth , the 24 satellites are the heart of the system . They constantly broadcast signals that allow a ground receiver to calculate its distance from each satellite , based on the precise time it takes the signal to travel from space to Earth . Each satellite carries four atomic_clocks -- so accurate that they lose only one second every 160 # 000 years . By capturing signals from at least three satellites , a receiver ' s software can determine which point on Earth is the exact distance from the satellites . The military_reserves for itself encrypted signals that provide an accuracy of 10 meters , within about 30 feet . Commercial users get a signal with random errors purposely created to reduce the accuracy to 100 meters -- a technique intended to deny foreign adversaries use of the system for precision guidance . But 100-meter accuracy is just fine for many civil applications . The navigation system , for example , is coming_to the rescue of motorists who get lost . General Motors was the first Big Three auto_maker to introduce a vehicle navigation system , which includes a computer-generated voice that tells drivers the route to any destination in the United States . Compact_discs will contain maps of every U.S. city , displayed on a dashboard screen . &quot; A good proportion of our society can ' t read maps at all , so they have to find their way by landmarks and verbal instructions , &quot; said Bill Spreitzer , GM ' s technical director for intelligent vehicle systems . &quot; Studies have shown that 20 % of the time , people drive further than they need to. &quot; Magellan Systems signed a deal last year to supply three Japanese auto_makers with the electronic guts for a navigation system . The contract is expected to double the firm ' s size in the next few years and create 750 new jobs . Magellan has moved to successively larger facilities in Southern California three times in the four years since it began producing commercial receivers . Sales of the privately held_firm this year are expected to top $ 30 million . &quot; Automobile navigation alone will dwarf the military market in size , &quot; said Magellan President Randy Hoffman . &quot; The commercial uses of GPS will far outstrip the military uses. &quot; Industry will also tap the system to enhance productivity . Experts see the day , for example , when a computerized design for a highway could be directly fed into earth-moving machinery controlled by the navigation system . A receiver on the blade of a plow could be used to precisely grade the roadbed . &quot; There are a lot of inefficiencies in society , and a lot of them can be resolved by answering the question , ' Where is it ? ' &quot; said Charlie Trimble , president of Trimble Navigation . Utility crews , for example , climb_up the wrong power pole 10 % of the time , a mistake that will be eliminated as poles are indexed by GPS location , Trimble said . Recently , his firm introduced floating navigation receivers that can be dropped on petroleum spills to precisely track the spread of oil contamination . Trimble Navigation led the GPS market in 1993 with sales of $ 150 million , specializing in highly accurate electronic systems used by land surveyors -- devices that have replaced Japanese , German and Swiss optical survey instruments , Trimble said . The firm expects sales growth of 50 % to 60 % annually . Meanwhile , software for computerized maps that use GPS data is becoming a huge market . Software created by ESRI , for example , is used by oil firms to create detailed geologic maps for exploration and by railroads for monitoring track conditions . With 1993 sales of $ 120 million , ESRI holds 70 % of the world market for such software , known as geographic information_systems . The firm ' s computerized maps were widely used to track the incidence of aftershocks following the Northridge earthquake . &quot; From the start , we saw that geographic information could link together many different functions in our society , &quot; said Jack Dangermond , ESRI ' s president and sole owner . &quot; We are just beginning to understand how we can use this. &quot; Indeed , airlines can use the system to fly more direct routes and save fuel . United Airlines recently estimated that it will save more_than $ 500 million annually by relying_on satellite navigation in the future . In February , the Federal Aviation Administration began allowing airlines to use GPS to navigate , but the agency will require aircraft to have a backup navigation system until 1996 , said Dick Arnold , the FAA ' s director for navigation systems . Navigation has been a crucial military technology for centuries , making_possible the spread of early empires , European settlement of the Western_Hemisphere and sophisticated warfare in the 20th Century . GPS is the ultimate extension of that concept . McNeff , the Pentagon expert , said the system will eventually be inserted into every type of weapon -- jet fighters , missiles , tanks , ships and precision ordnance . Until the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , many military_officers did not trust the untestedtechnology , but the system was crucial to the U.S. Army ' s success in outflanking Iraqi forces in the barren desert . &quot; It gave them the ability to operate in bad_weather , at night , coordinate movements and deliver weapons through smoke and haze , &quot; McNeff said . &quot; Commanders couldn ' t get their hands on them fast enough. &quot; Indeed , Magellan shipped 3 # 000 of its commercial receivers to U.S. and coalition forces that were short of the military versions . Rockwell leads the military market . The firm -- with electronics plants in Newbury Park and Newport Beach , Texas and Iowa -- plans to build 50 # 000 receivers this year and expects sales to grow 25 % annually . Explosive future growth in GPS applications will result largely from clever efforts to enhance the system ' s basic capability . Commercial users have discovered that they can vastly improve accuracy by using ground stations as additional reference_points to the satellite signal , yielding accuracy of one meter and , potentially , a_few millimeters . Differential Corrections in Cupertino , Calif. , is installing ground stations for the more accurate systems in 70 U.S. cities and has begun shipments of special receivers that customers will need , according to owner Ronald Haley , a former Trimble executive . The higher accuracy application -- known as differential GPS -- will allow airlines to use the system to perform precision landing_approaches in poor visibility . The FAA has authorized initial tests of such a system . Helping keep track of people is also clearly in the system ' s future . Authorities could follow parolees around with GPS , though one limitation is that the system does not work inside buildings or underground . &quot; You may someday want to hang one around your kid ' s neck before he goes_off to school , &quot; said Lanny Ross , president of Rockwell International ' s telecommunications group , a major producer of the systems for both military and commercial markets . Although GPS technology used to track individuals may someday raise concerns about personal privacy , the issue will be something for future generations to ponder , experts say . &quot; I think somewhere beyond the year 2050 , this will be embedded in you and your location will be known at all times , &quot; Ross suggested . &quot; I can imagine a set of social conditions where I would want people to know where I am at all times -- if I lived_in Colombia or Somalia. &quot; Where 911 Meets 2001 Global Positioning System satellites circling 11 # 000 miles above the Earth ( 1 ) broadcast signals to an ambulance , allowing the driver to determine his or her location ( 2 ) . The locations of all ambulances in the system are constantly being transmitted to a dispatch center ( 3 ) . The center routes the closest available vehicle to each emergency call and directs the ambulance to the appropriate health_facility ( 4 ) . Such systems , developed by Trimble Navigation of Sunnyvale , Calif. , are in_use by fire_departments and ambulance services in California and Arizona . The Global Reach of GPS * The Global Positioning System already is used for navigation by aircraft , boats and motor_vehicles . Land surveyors are rapidly trading_in their German , Swiss and Japanese optical_instruments for GPS devices . Truckers use the system to tabulate state road taxes . * Eventually , experts say , just about everything that moves -- trucks , trains , shipping containers , bulldozers , laptop_computers -- will contain GPS chips tied into massive information_systems . * The major players in GPS are located in California : Trimble Navigation , Magellan Systems , Ashtech , Rockwell International and Magnavox . GPS also is fostering growth in related industries , such_as the software that generates computerized maps -- a market in which ESRI of Redlands is the worldwide leader . * The GPS industry is growing at an estimated 20 % to 40 % annually and is expected to hit $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion in sales by the end of the decade , creating as_many as 100 # 000 new jobs . Experts say the industry will eclipse communications satellites in the commercial use of space . * The GPS system , which includes 24 satellites and a ground control_center , was put_in place by the Defense_Department . The system provides commercial users their position on Earth within 128 feet . Military users get a more accurate signal , which is used to guide missiles , navigate aircraft and control ground troops .</TEXT>
