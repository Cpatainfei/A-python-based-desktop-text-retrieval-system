   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; U.S. TROOPS TO BEGIN DISARMING HAITIAN MILITIA , SENATOR SAYS ; MILITARY : SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IS RISKY BUT NECESSARY , CONGRESSMAN REPORTS AFTER VISITING THE ISLAND NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. troops will themselves begin disarming the Haitian attaches who have attacked pro-democracy demonstrators if Haiti ' s police and military do not , a senior senator said Sunday after returning with the first congressional delegation to visit the Caribbean nation since U.S. forces intervened there . The difficult and potentially dangerous operation , in which U.S. troops could be forced to search out not only weapons caches but small arms held by individuals , could put the soldiers into direct confrontation with the shadowy civilian militia allied_with the Haitian police and military . &quot; Our forces there are going_to take steps_in the coming days to disarm this crowd , and they ' d like to do_it working with the Haitian armed forces , &quot; Sen . Christopher J . Dodd ( D-Conn. ) said . &quot; But . . . if that doesn ' t work_out , they ' re going to disarm them one way or the other. &quot; The U.S. military has avoided that task because of its great difficulty and the possibility of sustaining casualties . Before the U.S. intervention , rifles , hand_grenades and other portable weapons were distributed by the Haitian regime among paramilitary forces numbering more_than 1 # 000 and spread throughout the country . In the U.S. military intervention in Somalia , the lack of a successful disarmament effort played a key role in the violence and chaos that later enveloped the mission . Officials directing the Haiti operation are realizing that eventual success there now requires that disarmament somehow be accomplished , even at considerable risk , sources say . Dodd , interviewed on the CBS News_program &quot; Face the Nation , &quot; said he believes U.S. soldiers will be killed or wounded before the mission , which began two weeks ago and which the Senate team said could last a year , is completed . Because the congressional delegation is the first official group outside the Clinton_Administration to visit Haiti for an in-depth assessment since the U.S. troops landed , its findings are awaited with interest by both critics and supporters of the military operation . Congress is expected to vote this week whether to give the Administration a specific date for ending the U.S. deployment . Reflecting the divided opinion in Congress over the military_action , House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) warned that , in venturing into disarming the population , &quot; the Clinton_Administration is now on the edge of a disaster . . . . We are right now drifting steadily into a quicksand of misery. &quot; Sen . Paul Coverdell ( R-Ga. ) , who joined Dodd on the weekend visit to Haiti , said in a telephone_interview that &quot; no one knows who ' s calling the shots &quot; among Haitian leaders in the transition leading to the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , &quot; and that ' s not comforting. &quot; He said he came_away concerned that &quot; the end game &quot; -- how to wrap_up the U.S. military operation and put_in place the conditions for democracy -- was unclear . Administration officials stressed that other nations ' participation in the effort will now begin growing . Samuel Berger , the White_House deputy national security adviser , said on CNN ' s &quot; Late Edition &quot; that the first members of an international police_force of 2 # 000 from Caribbean nations will begin arriving in Haiti today . Officials said the U.S. force now numbers more_than 20 # 000 . The goal is that eventually most of the U.S. troops can be replaced by a U.N. mission to which 24 nations will contribute soldiers and police_officers . While U.S. officials said the United States will become more aggressive in disarming the plainclothes militia in Haiti , it remained unclear how far they will go_in this effort and whether it will be far enough to provide security for a stable transition . U.S. soldiers can seize caches of weapons and take weapons from individuals who they see carrying them . But house-to-house searches would be almost out_of_the_question in the crowded streets and shanties that make_up much of the attaches ' territory . Dodd said he believes that the attaches would diminish as a threat if the United States manages to capture their key leaders . &quot; There ' s a real structure here , and if you can get the top people and isolate them , capture them and hold them , this structure falls_apart , &quot; he said . &quot; The rest of this crowd will sort of disappear , and the threat of the paramilitary groups will dissipate. &quot; But Sen . Claiborne Pell ( D-R.I. ) , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the visiting congressional delegation , cast a skeptical eye on the chances for easy success . &quot; For the moment , we are not disarming the attaches unless we see them in a violent situation , &quot; he said . &quot; It will be very difficult to change the attaches . &quot; Pell said it is imperative to &quot; make_sure we have a vibrant police_force built_up by Americans. &quot; Maybe then the attaches &quot; will fade_away , &quot; he said . One central question hanging over the Haiti operation , and still unanswered , is whether Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the military_leader , will leave the country after he leaves_office . In meetings with the congressional delegation , he again committed himself to stepping_down by Oct . 15 , but he left it unclear whether he will try to remain in Haiti after Aristide is returned to office under the accord worked_out two weeks ago by former President Jimmy_Carter . The Senate delegation , according to Pell , made clear its view -- albeit with the rest of the Haitian high_command in the room -- that the general should leave Haiti . But , Pell said , &quot; he made no commitment to do that. &quot;</TEXT>
