   <HEADLINE> ACCESS TO SEC ELECTRONIC RECORDS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT , EXPENSIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Edgar , the vast government database on companies across America , is a treasure_house of public records . But it ' s been criticized as relatively inaccessible and too expensive . The recent experimental link of the Security and Exchange Commission ' s Edgar database to the popular Internet computer_network provides an important new means for affordable public access . Before this inexpensive computer link , people had to visit one of the SEC ' s public reference rooms in New York , Washington and Chicago to use the database . Or they would pay a considerable amount_of_money to private businesses who sell the government data to the public . According to James Love , director of Taxpayer Assets Project and a persistent SEC critic , the problem is the SEC designed a distribution system that favors corporate clients instead of the public . Thomas Vos , vice_president of the financial printing_company Bowne &amp; Co . in New York , agreed that the distribution side of Edgar needs improvement . John Lane , the SEC ' s chief information officer , defended the SEC ' s system as sound but admits Edgar distribution is in its infancy . Lane said he &quot; had expected to see more retail services at this point &quot; based on the Edgar database but figures there haven ' t been enough companies listed on the database to inspire private industry to develop new products . Edgar contains annual reports , proxy statements and other important information from one-fifth of the 15 # 000 companies that report to the SEC . All companies will come_on line by 1997 . While a document downloaded from the Internet site costs only a_few dollars , a paper copy of the same document would cost more_than $ 50 from a leading SEC data vendor , Disclosure Inc. Love , whose group is affiliated with consumer activist Ralph Nader , takes particular issue with the SEC ' s contract with Mead Data Central of Dayton , Ohio . Mead has a $ 72 million SEC contract to sell the Edgar information on a wholesale basis to other commercial vendors . Love maintains that Mead has little incentive to provide inexpensive public access to the Edgar files , since the company already makes considerable money selling a separate stream of SEC data to corporations on its Nexis-Lexis database . Industry_analysts say the SEC information is a small but valuable product for the Nexis-Lexis database , the backbone for Mead ' s electronic publishing business , which had 1993 sales of $ 551.3 million . Mead spokeswoman Judi Schultz said Mead ' s market isn ' t the casual individual consumer , but intensive users of information such_as law_firms , large news organizations and investment banks . Schultz also denied Love ' s charges that Mead has a conflict_of_interest since it has the wholesale Edgar contract and also sells SEC information on Nexis-Lexis . The SEC regulates and audits the wholesale prices Mead charges for the Edgar data . One reason consumers may have been slow to gain affordable access to Edgar has been the upheaval in the industry . Disclosure Inc. , a leading SEC information vendor , last February acquired data vendor SEC Online of Hauppauge , N.Y. , and in 1991 bought Bechtel Information Services Inc. , the provider of paper and microfiche copies of SEC filings to the public . But consumers may see more low-cost offerings of the SEC documents in the wake of the Internet link to Edgar , industry officials said . Both Disclosure and Mead say they ' re studying how to distribute SEC filings to individuals .</TEXT>
