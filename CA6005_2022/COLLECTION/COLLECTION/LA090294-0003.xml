   <HEADLINE> SMOG AGENCY SEEKS TO PUT LID ON RESTAURANT BROILERS ; POLLUTION : PLAN WOULD FORCE ABOUT 6 # 000 EATERIES TO CURB EMISSIONS . BUSINESSES FEAR ECONOMIC IMPACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the corner of Beverly and Rampart boulevards in Los Angeles , the mouthwatering smell of Tommy ' s famous chili burgers has wafted through the air for almost 50 years . But that familiar odor of burgers -- savory to some , unpleasant to others -- could soon be a thing of the past throughout the Southland . Although fumes from burgers , steaks , chicken and other fried and broiled foods may be relished by gourmands and gluttons , they also are a major source of smog . From McDonald ' s and In-N-Out Burgers to Lawry ' s and Ruth ' s Chris Steak House , about 6 # 000 restaurants would be forced to reduce smoke from charbroilers , griddles and deep-fat fryers under a proposal unveiled Thursday by the South Coast Air Quality Management District . The agency says Southland restaurants emit 33 tons of pollution into the air daily -- as_many hydrocarbons as oil_refineries and nine times more soot particles than all_the region ' s buses . Fat , as it decomposes , releases petroleum-based gases into the air , and when grease drops on open flames , it emits smoky particulates that obstruct visibility and lodge_in lungs . &quot; We don ' t have to give_up our burgers . We just won ' t be choking on as much smoke , &quot; AQMD spokesman Sam Atwood said . &quot; Restaurants are a very significant source of emissions . This is not a tiny , insignificant source. &quot; Under the AQMD proposal , restaurants in Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties that cook more_than 50 pounds of meat per day and 25 pounds of non-meat would have to reduce emissions . That would encompass fast-food chains , large restaurants , &quot; mom-and-pop &quot; operations and coffee and doughnut shops . Residential kitchens , catering vehicles and charity operations would be exempt . AQMD officials -- who had postponed the proposal for five years because of concerns of restaurant owners and technical gaps -- are bracing for the same type of jokes and public backlash they faced in 1990 when they targeted fumes from back-yard barbecues . A series of workshops to discuss the proposal begins Tuesday , while the air quality board has scheduled a vote_in November . Restaurant representatives reacted with concern Thursday , saying they would have trouble complying with the proposed deadlines and pollution limits and might have to increase prices . Under the first phase of the proposal , existing restaurants would have three years to meet a limit of 2.25 pounds of hydrocarbons per day -- equivalent_to cooking about 1 # 200 quarter-pound burgers -- and one pound of particulates , equal_to about 500 Quarter Pounders , said Peter Votlucka , an AQMD air quality engineer . New restaurants would have two years . In seven years , all restaurants would have to reduce their emissions to no more_than half a pound of hydrocarbons a day and 0.4 of a pound of particulates . &quot; I think it will affect every chain . Anybody who cooks meat will have a problem , &quot; said Larry Leis , construction services director for Irvine-based El Pollo Loco , which operates about 150 restaurants in the four-county basin . Gerald Breitbart , business issues consultant for the California Restaurant Assn. , said the provisions are especially unreasonable for popular fast-food restaurants that cook large volumes of burgers . &quot; The toughest part of this thing is that we cannot control the consumer and we cannot control the product , &quot; he said . To comply , many restaurants might turn_to essentially the same smog control technology installed on automobiles -- catalytic_converters . Five Southland restaurants , including one at Knott ' s Berry Farm in Buena Park , are experimenting with the catalysts . Attached_to a steel hood on top of a charbroiler , it turns the cooking fumes into harmless water and carbon_dioxide . But Breitbart said that installing the devices costs $ 5 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 , and that they may_not be effective enough to meet the proposed limits . Many restaurant owners also question the accuracy of AQMD tests that measure emissions from their broilers and fryers , suggesting that no one really knows how much they emit . Leis said the industry needs more time to ensure that the testing procedure is_on target . El Pollo Loco has cleaned_up much of its smoke by devising a chicken cooker that sits upright and prevents grease from dripping onto flames . At a cost of $ 30 # 000 per restaurant , the chain has installed them at 25 locations and plans to expand their use to all sites in the basin if the rule is adopted . But Leis said the new cookers will probably satisfy only the first phase of requirements -- which he called &quot; a good , practical , reasonable &quot; proposal . The second , more stringent step would be &quot; awfully hard to attain , &quot; he said . &quot; I really think it will be economically prohibitive , &quot; Leis said . &quot; The technologies are not out there now and the AQMD is banking on those technologies coming forth. &quot; AQMD officials believe their proposal would eliminate 60 % of emissions from all_the region ' s restaurants -- amounting to a reduction of almost 12 tons of hydrocarbons per day and eight tons of particulates . Breitbart said the AQMD is grossly overestimating the extent of the problem because it bases its estimates on restaurants that charbroil the fattiest meat -- hamburgers . &quot; We ' re not saying that restaurants shouldn ' t have to be regulated , &quot; he said . &quot; What we ' re saying is let ' s try to find_out what we are trying to regulate before we pass a rule. &quot; AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly compared the concerns to those raised four years ago when the AQMD ordered manufacturing changes in barbecue lighter fluid . At the time , some opponents coined the misleading phrase &quot; use a barbecue , go_to jail. &quot; But Kelly said manufacturers have succeeded in complying by creating many barbecue fluids , chips and other new products that are cleaner burning . &quot; It is a success story , &quot; Kelly said . &quot; It has cleaned the air and people can still barbecue using a great number of products. &quot;</TEXT>
