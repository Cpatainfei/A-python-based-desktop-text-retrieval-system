   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; RAIN , HAIL PELT LIBRARY MOURNERS ; WEATHER : UNSEASONABLE STORM MAY RETURN DURING OUTDOOR NIXON BURIAL . CHILLY TEMPERATURES LIKELY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mourners and onlookers who had gathered at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace here Tuesday got caught in a rare Southern California hailstorm and an unseasonal downpour of rain , which is predicted to make a return appearance during the outdoor funeral of Richard Nixon today . There was a 30 % chance of rain , partly cloudy skies and cool temperatures that likely would not rise above 60 degrees today , according to Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . The hail and rain hit with a Pacific storm that was passing_over the Southland , a more common occurrence in the winter than in the spring . &quot; For this time_of_year in Southern California , it ' s unusual . Having heavy rains and strong thunder is something you might expect more in the winter months , &quot; Brack said , adding that a strong trough of low_pressure in the upper atmosphere in Southern California caused the rain , which periodically was transformed into golf ball-sized hailstones . At first only the blocks immediately surrounding the Nixon library were pelted with rain and hail Tuesday morning . But by mid-afternoon , many well-prepared onlookers at the library , huddling under umbrellas and too dogged to give_up their place in_line for the afternoon viewing of the presidential casket , were drenched as the occasional showers turned_into a downpour . There was also thunder -- one thunderclap so loud that it set_off a car alarm -- lightning and hailstorms in Yorba Linda at 2:50 p.m. and 3:35 p.m. , which experts consider unusual and don ' t expect today . Brack said that because the storm system is weakening , any rain in Yorba Linda today will likely be light . &quot; We are not expecting any thunderstorms , &quot; he said , and there were no flood or storm warnings in_effect for Orange County today . The amount of rainfall was no more_than 1.3 inches at any one place in Orange County Tuesday morning , officials said , and no more_than that is expected today . But unseasonable weather took its toll Tuesday evening . At 4:15 p.m. , the California Highway Patrol closed Carbon Canyon Road from Valencia Avenue to the San Bernardino County_line because of icy roads and mudslides around Carbon Canyon Regional Park . Bad road conditions also caused a 10-car pileup at 3:45 p.m. on Carbon Canyon Road north of Olinda Place in Brea , where area residents reported snow and hail . Ice and hail were also reported on the Riverside Freeway near Weir Canyon Road , officials said . Also , about 20 weather-related accidents on Orange County freeways occurred Tuesday , most of which did not result in injuries . Officials blamed the pileups not only on the rain but motorists ' stubborn refusal to slow_down in bad_weather .</TEXT>
