   <HEADLINE> LATINS ARE READY FOR TRUE PARTNERSHIP ; SUMMIT : WITH DEMOCRACY TAKING_HOLD , HEADS OF STATE ARE EAGER TO STRIKE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AGREEMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in almost 30 years , and at the behest of President Clinton , Latin_American and Caribbean heads_of_state ( except Fidel Castro of Cuba ) will meet this weekend in Miami with their North_American counterparts . Inter-American relations have undergone a sea change in these three decades , especially in the post-Cold War years . Thirty years ago , security considerations prevailed in the way the United States interacted with its southern neighbors . Today , economic considerations top the list . Thirty years ago , a highly asymmetrical relationship existed between the United States and each Latin_American country , punctuated , on the part of the latter , by resentments , suspicions and even a measure of animosity . Today , the dialogue is more relaxed , mature and balanced . The enhanced presence of Canada in hemispheric affairs has also helped to mitigate many confrontational remnants of the past . Change within Latin_America has kept pace with the astounding transformations in the world economy and in international relations . Domestic insurrectional movements are giving_way to consensus-building , and where authoritarian military regimes once prevailed , today a democratic culture is gradually taking_root ; virtually all heads_of_state are civilians , democratically elected . The population of the region has grown from under 220 million in 1960 to 480 million today , although current rates of population growth are declining rapidly . Latin_Americans are_better educated ( literacy is up from 66 % to 89 % ; middle-school attendance increased from 15 % to 56 % and university attendance increased twelvefold ) , healthier ( life_expectancy is up from 56 to 69 years ) and more urbanized ( from less than 50 % to more_than 70 % ) . And real per-capita gross_domestic_product increased from the U.S. equivalent of $ 1 # 200 to $ 2 # 100 ( in 1980 prices ) in spite of the prolonged and deep recession of the 1980s -- a lost decade in terms of growth -- while imports increased from $ 10 billion to $ 190 billion . The content and scope of public policy have also changed markedly . Import substitution has given_way to international competitiveness ; populist experiments have been replaced by fiscal and monetary prudence ; many public enterprises have been privatized , and macroeconomic policy-making has gained in coherence and stability . As a result , inflation is down , growth is up and exports are increasingly diversified . Intraregional trade grows at spectacular rates : In 1993 , more_than a fifth of total exports were within the region . The concept of preferential , non-reciprocal treatment in trade between the United States and developing countries of the region is gradually giving_way to preferential but reciprocal arrangements ; these offer more stability in the long_run than unilateral concessions , which can be withdrawn as easily as they are bestowed . In this respect , the North_American Free_Trade Agreement between Canada , Mexico and the United States , open_to extension to other countries of the region , is a pioneering innovation . To be sure , many problems remain . With important differences between countries , marked contrasts exist between world-class opulence and lacerating privation . Unemployment and poverty are widespread . Human_rights are still violated in some countries . Many institutions , including judicial_systems and political_parties , tend to be weak . Public administrations remain debilitated by the financial crunch of the 1980s . Investment ratios are insufficient to boost growth_rates to truly satisfactory levels . Environmental degradation is affecting the region ' s natural capital endowment and urban_sprawl adversely affects the quality_of_life of millions . Physical infrastructure is inadequate . These problems have national , regional and international implications . They also affect hemispheric relations in such vital areas as trade and financial flows , migration ( legal and illegal ) , the exchange of technologies and the illicit traffic in drugs . The heads_of_state meeting in Miami will have a chance to put inter-American relations on a new footing . In this spirit of more balanced and mature relations , Latin_American and Caribbean leaders will arrive , not with a list of petitions , but rather with an agenda of mutually_beneficial proposals for tapping the enormous potential of working together to seize joint opportunities and to solve common problems . Moreover , strengthening links between the countries of this hemisphere is not a zero-sum proposition that will somehow weaken the ties between those countries and the rest of the world . On the contrary , it should be viewed_as a steppingstone toward a more open and integrated international economy .</TEXT>
