   <HEADLINE> TECHNOLOGY ; SCOTTSDALE VIES FOR BIG BOOST FROM NASA ' S VAST DATABASES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For decades , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the nation proud by sending Americans to the moon and launching legions of robot vehicles and satellites into orbit and to other worlds . But a series of failures , including the shuttle Challenger disaster and the faulty Hubble Space Telescope , and the end of the Cold_War changed that , prompting many to ask whether it made_sense to foot the bill for any space_program simply for its prestige value . In the face of dwindling budgets , NASA now is taking_aim at earthly problems by making the terabytes upon terabytes of data it has gathered_in space over the last 30 years available to the public . The goal is to stimulate economic_growth and improve the quality_of_life and education for those who foot the bill for the nation ' s space_programs -- the American taxpayers . This booming Arizona resort community of well-landscaped lawns , golf_course fairways and Western-style stucco homes is competing to be among the first to benefit from NASA ' s new High Performance Computing and Communications Program . More_than 400 communities , high-tech corporations , school districts and farming businesses across the nation have submitted proposals for using NASA ' s vast databases via the Internet , a system of more_than 7 # 000 networks linking 1 million host computers and 8 million users that is paving the way for the &quot; information superhighway. &quot; NASA stopped accepting proposals for the pilot_project on Monday , and winners of the coveted cooperative agreements will be announced sometime in July . Given the challenges ahead , it is no wonder that Scottsdale is vying for the prize . It was born a dusty , one-square-mile hamlet of 2 # 000 people in 1951 , and has mushroomed into a 185-square-mile city of 165 # 000 people that attracts 5 million snowbirds a year . Scottsdale officials say they need all_the help they can get_to accommodate business and residential growth without destroying the surrounding Sonoran Desert landscape of scenic mountains , boulder outcroppings and Saguaro cactus forests . Here , change is magnified at the interface between urban development and fragile desert terrain . Here , too , data collected by remote sensing equipment aboard satellites about plants , soil , air , water , wind , rain and even lightning strikes in the region would be invaluable in determining , for example , where best to put a new road or a relocated business . Instead of dispatching survey crews to map plans for a hiking trail , planners could request the relevant data from NASA and , with a click of a computer mouse , receive everything they need to make an informed decision . &quot; Shaping the future of a rapidly growing community such_as ours means coming_up with short- and long-term strategies , &quot; Scottsdale City_Manager Richard Bowers said . &quot; This tool would allow us to play_out an array of future scenarios , &quot; he added . &quot; It could also make us more competitive than other communities in terms of attracting corporations looking_for a place to set_up technology centers. &quot; Bowers also has high hopes that securing a cooperative agreement with NASA could spark new interest in a proposed space science center for Scottsdale that has suffered from a lack of focus and financing . That project was falling_apart until Scottsdale hired former aerospace_engineer and space exploration enthusiast Wil Orr a year ago to pick_up the pieces and round_up financial partners ranging from school districts to high-tech industries . &quot; It ' s incredibly exciting for us , &quot; Orr said . &quot; And it heralds a new era for NASA . After 30 years of exploring outer space , NASA is coming home. &quot; And NASA may have more to gain from the program than the communities that want to tap into its databases at barely more_than the cost of placing a long-distance telephone_call . Paul Hunter , program manager of the space agency ' s new information service , said that &quot; the hope is that , as these applications start to become visible and public , more and more people will see that NASA missions are relevant to everyday life. &quot;</TEXT>
