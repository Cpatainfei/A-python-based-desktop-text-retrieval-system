   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION : FOX DROPS THE BALL ON SUNDAY ' S POST-GAME LINEUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fox stunned just about everyone by audaciously outbidding venerable CBS for telecast rights to the National Football_League . An even bigger surprise would be Fox enticing a large chunk of its football and John Madden junkies to hang_around on Sundays for a prime-time lineup that opens feebly with &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; and closes obnoxiously with &quot; Wild Oats. &quot; Both series premiere this weekend , sharing the evening with two gasping oldies , &quot; The Simpsons &quot; and &quot; Married . . . With Children , &quot; and &quot; Hardball , &quot; a new baseball comedy that has been undergoing so many 11th-hour revisions ( not a hopeful sign ) that a review tape was unavailable prior to its own Sunday debut . &quot; Spy adventure &quot; is the label charitably given &quot; Fortune_Hunter , &quot; whose hero is former Cold_War agent Carlton Dial ( Mark Frankel ) , a high-tech James Bond . His mission now is to recover the world ' s most sought-after items , and his actions are visually monitored and supported back at the home_office by nerdy and eccentric ( is there any other kind ? ) computer wizard Harry Flack ( John Robert Hoffman ) . Flack is the voice in Dial ' s ear , a la Holly Hunter whispering information to anchor William Hurt from the control_room in &quot; Broadcast News. &quot; Fox is hoping that Dial , its &quot; man ' s man who is irresistible to women , &quot; will also prove irresistible to the men ' s men and anyone else zooming_in on football . He won ' t lack for exposure . When teams are not filling the air with footballs , Fox surely will be filling the airwaves with promos for &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; and the rest of its Sunday night schedule . The protagonist of &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; is not just a playboy , says Fox , for &quot; underneath his wink and smile , Dial performs his high-risk assignments with deadly seriousness. &quot; Too_much seriousness , actually : This is minimalist Bond in every sense . As Dial searches for a sort of doomsday weapon known as Frostfire -- while encountering the obligatory beautiful blonde -- you ' re struck by the clunky premiere ' s absence of wit and style , to say nothing of a plot unworthy even of fanciful escapism . In a final act of bungled-Bond derivation , moreover , Dial and his sexy female companion end their low-budget adventure by romantically floating out_to sea in a raft . Just as lethal are the premiere ' s wooden performances . A supposedly charismatic hero who is somehow devoid_of charisma , Briton Frankel ' s Dial is even more forgettable than George Lazenby , who had one_shot as Bond in 1969 ' s &quot; On Her Majesty ' s Secret Service. &quot; Fittingly , it turns_out that his gun shoots darts that put people to sleep . Agent Dial . License to tranquilize . Meanwhile , on to &quot; Wild_Oats , &quot; another signature series for Fox , perennially last among the four major networks in households , first in raging hormones . Playfully mocking the hand that feeds it , Sunday ' s season opener for &quot; The Simpsons &quot; features a line that applies here . &quot; Honey , what ' s on Fox , tonight ? &quot; Homer Simpson asks his wife . &quot; Something ribald , no doubt. &quot; Pointlessly ribald , in the case of the comedy &quot; Wild_Oats , &quot; Fox ' s horniest series of the evening -- no small feat given that it follows &quot; Married . . . With Children. &quot; The &quot; Wild_Oats &quot; main foursome consists_of photographer Jack Slayton ( Tim Conlon ) , social_worker Brian Grant ( Paul Rudd ) , teacher Shelly Thomas ( Paula Marshall ) and hairdresser Liz Bradford ( Jana Marie Hupp ) . All somewhere in their 20s , all idiots . When they ' re not at a Chicago singles bar named the Hangar , they do their flying at Jack and Brian ' s apartment . As if the dangers of impulsive sex in the ' 90s didn ' t exist , the premiere revolves_around sleeping around . The especially grating Jack has a fit when his former girlfriend , Shelly , begins dating his somewhat dense best_friend and roommate , Brian . He and a bimbo he ' s out with even eavesdrop from the bedroom on Shelly and Brian talking in the living room . The premiere desperately needs its own condom to filter_out bad jokes and raunch . Sample : &quot; I ' ve dated before , &quot; Brian says . &quot; I ' ve felt the gentle thump of the headboard against the wall. &quot; Fox ' s Sunday nightcap . &quot; You ' re disgusting , &quot; Shelly tells Jack . Exactly . * THE STALKER . There he was_on the street Monday with a KCBS-TV Channel 2 camera operator , pursuing , even badgering Mark Fuhrman , the Los Angeles police_detective whose credibility has been under heavy attack by the O . J . Simpson defense_team . There he was , Channel 2 ' s Inquiring Mind on the run with a microphone , repeatedly imploring Fuhrman to speak , as Fuhrman firmly resisted . Even though Fuhrman , like anyone else , has a right not to speak_to the media -- who do these reporters think they are , God ' s appointees or something ? -- his refusal gave the impression that he had something to hide , even if he didn ' t . Maybe that was the purpose . The whole scene was a pitiful display of TV again using the ambush interview like an assault weapon , using it to bully someone who was seeking to remain silent . Again , his right . The Channel 2 reporter was doing plenty of talking , though . &quot; I ' m just trying to do my job , &quot; Harvey Levin pleaded to Fuhrman . That job is harassment . * &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; premieres at 7 pm Sunday with &quot; Hardball &quot; at 8:30 and &quot; Wild_Oats &quot; at 9:30 , on Fox ( Channels 11 and 6 ) .</TEXT>
