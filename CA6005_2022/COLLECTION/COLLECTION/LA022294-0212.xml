   <HEADLINE> TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEM OF DANGEROUS WASTES ; INDUSTRY : UC IRVINE , OTHER GROUPS HAVE LAUNCHED AD_CAMPAIGN URGING APPROVAL OF CONTROVERSIAL DISPOSAL FACILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every day , students and researchers step into UC Irvine ' s science laboratories to stretch their minds and their creative limits as they seek to help solve mankind ' s ills . Their successes are helping create a strong biotechnology industry in Orange County , but their dross -- low-level radioactive waste left when their experiments are completed -- is stored in 55-gallon drums and stacked in a trailer_parked on the campus . For the past year , the university has been storing its own radioactive waste because , like all other such radioactive waste producers in California , it does not have a place to dump it safely and legally . &quot; It ' s not going anywhere , &quot; lamented Jim Tripodef , UCI ' s associate director of environmental health and safety . To solve that dilemma , UCI and a group of other organizations have launched an advertising_campaign urging the federal_government to speed_up approval of the controversial Ward Valley project , a radioactive waste disposal facility proposed for construction in the eastern Mojave_Desert near Needles . The dump ' s approval is_on indefinite hold while the courts rule on environmental safety issues and a spate of lawsuits challenging the dump . The coalition of dump proponents , whose members include the Orange County Biomedical Industry Council and Southern California Edison , said in its latest advertisement -- printed in local newspapers last week -- that if the Ward Valley project is not approved , California ' s beleaguered economy could experience a further loss of as_many as 200 # 000 jobs . &quot; California Has Lost More Than 800 # 000 Jobs in the Past Five Years , &quot; the advertisement states . &quot; Are We Trying_for a_Million ? &quot; The coalition also charged that unless the dump is approved , the state ' s growing biotechnology industry will be hampered severely and the nation will suffer from a resultant slowdown in new medical discoveries . &quot; This is a very important issue , &quot; said Daniel Korpolinski , president of the biomedical council and chief_executive_officer of CoCensys Inc. , an Irvine firm that is studying new drugs to cure certain brain-related diseases . &quot; We can ' t go_on without a place to put this waste. &quot; Korpolinski ' s company is not alone . From Fullerton to San Clemente , Orange County health_care companies involved in discovering new drugs and procedures are stymied about where to put the radioactive waste , a necessary byproduct of the research and development process . &quot; We ' ve been accumulating this stuff for some time , &quot; said Mike Timmermann , a spokesman at Allergan Inc. , the Irvine maker of eye- and skin-care products . Alan A . Steigart , president of Cortex Pharmaceuticals Inc. , which is developing drugs to treat Alzheimer ' s disease , added that if California wants to pull itself out of the recession for good , it should create a friendly environment for businesses -- like the biotech industry -- that promise to grow the fastest in the next 10 years . &quot; The state can ' t have it both ways , &quot; he said . &quot; You can ' t invite industry here and then stifle it. &quot; But local activists insist that Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt made the correct decision in November when he put a stop to a land transfer that would have made the Ward Valley dump a reality . Babbitt ruled that transfer of the property to U.S. Ecology Inc. , the Kentucky firm that would build and manage the dump , should not proceed until several environmental lawsuits filed by Ward Valley opponents are settled -- a process that could take years . The delay is justified , dump opponents said . &quot; This affects the entire public ' s health , &quot; said Marion Sack , executive_director of Santa Ana-based Alliance for Survival . She added that the dump would be a final resting place not only for low-level radioactive waste produced by medical facilities but also for radioactive waste from nuclear_power plants . &quot; Babbitt ' s decision was wisely made , &quot; she said . Sack said her group also opposes the dump because plans call_for building it without expensive liners to prevent radioactive waste from leeching into underground water sources . The proposed dump would be near the Colorado_River , Sack said , and could possibly pollute one of Southern California ' s major water sources . She also blasted the coalition ' s advertising_campaign , noting that her group does not have the funds to match the pro-Ward Valley organizations ' publicity campaign . &quot; You can bet those are expensive ads , &quot; Sack said . &quot; There is no way we can possibly compete with that kind of exposure and that kind of money. &quot; But Ward Valley proponents say that the dump ' s opponents , backed by U.S. Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , have been making themselves heard . In a passage that alluded to Boxer ' s presence among the ranks of Ward Valley foes , last week ' s advertisement charged that Babbitt was &quot; bowing to pressure by special_interest groups and certain politicians. &quot; Biomedical council president Korpolinski charged that Boxer has exaggerated the dangers of the disposal site , threatening the future of the biotechnology industry , which &quot; promises to be the biggest creator of jobs in the 1990s. &quot;</TEXT>
