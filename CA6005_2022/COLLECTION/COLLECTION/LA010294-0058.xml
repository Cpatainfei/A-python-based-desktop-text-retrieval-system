   <TEXT> Regarding &quot; A Matter of Sense , Not Dollars , &quot; commentary by Times art critic Christopher Knight ( Dec . 19 ) : Knight ' s extraordinary polemic affirming the importance of John McLaughlin as the &quot; first , major , postwar Modern artist to have emerged in Southern California &quot; is well-taken . How many California artists of that era are represented by works in the collections of some 35 top museums , including the Albright-Knox Art_Gallery , Art Institute of Chicago , Baltimore Museum of Art , Corcoran Art_Gallery , Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Metropolitan Museum of Art , Museum of Modern Art , National Museum of American Art and Whitney Museum of American Art ? I would dispute Knight ' s statement that &quot; there is no place in the world . . . to see a full , representative display &quot; of McLaughlin ' s art . The Kawamura Museum , near Tokyo , has a very fine , carefully assembled collection of nine paintings , including a rare diptych , and 13 lithographs . Of course , this fact serves only to emphasize a central point of Knight ' s article : that our region does not sufficiently attend_to its own cultural heritage . A photo caption printed with the article ( surely written by an editor , not by Knight ) claims , &quot; No major exhibition of ( McLaughlin ' s ) work has been compiled. &quot; Before his death in 1976 , McLaughlin retrospectives were mounted by several museums around the country . The Laguna Art Museum will present the first posthumous retrospective of McLaughlin ' s paintings , which I am organizing , from next Oct . 28 to Jan . 15 , 1995 , after which a version of the show will travel_to art museums in Baltimore , Newark , N.J. , and Oakland . At the same time , we will publish the first major book on the work of this very important artist from Southern California . CHARLES DESMARAIS Director , Laguna Art Museum Laguna Beach * It ' s not about money . It ' s about politics , party-line politics . Since Knight arrived on the L.A. art scene , he has been actively engaged in devaluing most Abstract_art . He has been the champion of a politically strident art that has been responsible_for alienating what was a blossoming art audience . Knight states that &quot; the art scene is a complex ecology &quot; and that &quot; artists and their work stand at its center. &quot; It ' s my impression that some critics , and this critic in particular , have placed themselves in the center of that art scene and allow access only to those artists who share their political agendas . It is no wonder that L.A. collectors are a little jumpy about what is being represented as viable artwork . That Knight would ask_for a major exhibition of John McLaughlin ' s work is a non_sequitur , on par with Bill_Clinton talking_about family values . It ' s true that McLaughlin deserves a major retrospective , but God help us if Knight writes that exhibition catalogue . JOHN EDEN Culver City * I guess I ' m one of those Knight likes to refer to as an anti-intellectual . In order for that to be the case , however , the art Knight coos and oohs about must therefore be &quot; intellectual. &quot; Pray , educate me as_to the intellectual depths of a painting with a broad swath of one color , a narrow stroke of another and a third , broad swath of yet a different color . Sorry , pal , I just don ' t see it , and I refuse to pretend that I do_in order to avoid being called names by various art critics so divorced from reality-realism that they couldn ' t see the forest for the trees in a Magritte . I clearly lack the cranial might of your Mr. Knight . What he sees as profound , I can only see as empty interior_decoration . Perhaps Blake should have continued his famous poem : &quot; And see the most profound thought possible , in a big minimalistic blotch of blue. &quot; I don ' t think even that great visionary could have quite managed it . The Berlin Wall has fallen , and soon the razor-wire walls of &quot; Modern art &quot; will likewise tumble , allowing the illumination to be cast upon works that convey pith and moment and , yes , even beauty , without the need for an intermediary to try to justify the validity of some simple-minded paint spattering or idiotic installation . So_much of the world of Modern art is empty_of true intellect that its very airiness will solidify its ultimate ephemerality . So enough , already ! Be gone , you dandified purveyors of intellectual fraud . You emperors of Modern hucksterism . Oh , and while you ' re leaving , put some clothes on ! JAMES COWAN Beverly Hills * Bravo , Mr. Knight , for having the guts to stand_up and say what needs to be said . But while you were flailing that shotgun about , perhaps you should have leveled a blast or two at the artists . Artists are also members of the art audience and public , and as such should not escape their fair share of the responsibility for the condition of this Los Angeles art world . For years artists have allowed the politics of fear to create a plantation-style mentality that dominates the consciousness of the art community . This scenario allows_for a_few house artists who must fearfully guard their places against the onslaught of field artists . If you want to eat_at the Art table , you must be one or the other . During the Van Cliburn piano competition , two of the judges wanted to establish that they did not view the competitors as entertainers . This point was extremely important to them . I see the pervading influence of Hollywood as the main progenitor of this entertainment idea . Artists now routinely accept that they are entertainers , just like all_the other entertainers crowding an already far overcrowded entertainment world . This idea forces artists into a shuck-and-jive life that produces lurid , bombastic , political works or , in the opposite direction , works of repressed , quiet , brittle beauty . This needs to be noticed , that this now self-induced need to be entertaining has lowered the standards we should be measuring ourselves against , creating a situation where blunt literalness is expected , poetic exploration lost . We expect bureaucrats and the audience to move with the herd instinct . We wish artists would n ' t . FRITZ HUDNUT Venice * I am grateful to The Times and critic Knight for his piece on the dearth of vision and leadership with_respect_to Southern California artists . At last a forthright , thorough and credible expose of both attitudes and institutions failing their responsibilities to the arts community . In particular , I would like to expand his critique of the Cultural Affairs Department . Under Director Al Nodal , the department has reflected Bolshevik tendencies , transforming itself at best into a social_service agency and at worst into a pork_barrel for City_Council members . After being created through the largest-ever political effort by the L.A. arts community , the department reshaped itself into an agency that disrespects and mistrusts that community . The department now emphasizes art concerned with social issues or directly involving an &quot; underserved &quot; constituency , not art based on merit . This policy in theory benefits the community as_a_whole by requiring artists to consider the needs of the audience . More accurately it reflects a devaluation of what artists now produce . Nodal ' s restrictions perpetuate the stereotype that art is elitist , indulgent and irrelevant . They also buy the discredited notion that government can engineer good art . As Knight says , the L.A. arts community -- probably the nation ' s largest -- indeed produces thoughtful , exciting , diverse artwork , often toured and exhibited around the nation and abroad . It is time that the Cultural Affairs Department had the leadership to match this community achievement . We need a leader who will make the political case for arts dollars , who will fund artwork on the basis of merit and who understands that quality art will do what he now is trying to forcibly engineer . DAVID PLETTNER Managing Director and Dancer Loretta Livingston &amp; Dancers Los Angeles * Knight ' s commentary put the stifling expectations placed on L.A. artists into the proper context by drawing a link to the lack of institutional , governmental and public self-confidence from which this city continues to suffer . I appreciated even more his analysis of American anti-intellectualism and of the muddled logic that surrounds specificity in art . Knight is a critic of perspective and depth , with the rare ability to spot the real issues and discuss them with creativity . I have always admired Knight ' s critiques of what is kitsch and delusive , but this time I was really dancing . RIKA OHARA Los Angeles</TEXT>
