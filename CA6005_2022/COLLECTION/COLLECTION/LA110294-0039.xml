   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEWS ; WORDS FAIL ' MACK AND MABEL ' ; ENERGETIC CHOREOGRAPHY AND PERFORMANCES KEEP CSUF ' S PRODUCTION MOVING ALONG DESPITE A SLUGGISH BOOK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throughout Cal State Fullerton ' s production of Jerry Herman ' s &quot; Mack and Mabel , &quot; a nagging question keeps interrupting : Why would anyone want to revive this show ? Actually , on the surface &quot; M &amp; M &quot; ( melts on the stage , not in your heart ) appears to have a lot going_for it : two sparkling personalities of the silent film era -- comedy meister Mack Sennett and ageless comedian Mabel Normand -- and , for its composer to mine , one of the most interesting , rapidly changing and fruitful eras of musical invention in this century . But instead of molding these ingredients into something of substance , book writer Michael Stewart not only has bent film history beyond its breaking point , he has created a juvenile , simplistic bio-fiction about his two protagonists and has surrounded them with an early Hollywood that makes &quot; Singin ' in the Rain &quot; look_like Chekhov . Most of composer Jerry Herman ' s score , meanwhile , sounds retread from his other shows . &quot; When Mabel Comes_in the Room &quot; is a signature , leading-lady tune that could be sung in counterpoint to Herman ' s anthems to Mame and Dolly without clashing . Has this production overcome all these problems ? Only here and there . It ' s a good-looking show , as classy as a lot of Broadway musicals were in the days before the genre developed elephantiasis . Co-directed by Donn Finn and Broadway veteran Lara Teeter , it moves along , except for some of the book sections , which seem too sluggish . But maybe that ' s the tone the directors want ( the musical direction by Jeff Fairbanks is pretty sluggish itself ) . It ' s as though Finn and Teeter are trying to make_it all seem important by giving it heaviness . But &quot; Mack and Mabel &quot; is only a Woolworth ' s trinket , not a Cartier tiara . The biggest advantages are some of the performances . Kirsten S . Vangsness ' Mabel is delightful from her poor-Irish homespun in Act One through her sequined gowns in Act Two . She fills them all with authority , energy and a quick , puckish humor that hints of the original Mabel , along with the naive confusion that beset Normand ' s later career . And Vangsness sings like a dream . * Eric Bishop has the hurdle of Stewart ' s Sennett to surmount : He must play a loud-mouthed , vulgar egomaniac and make him likable . Bishop almost succeeds in making the difficult switches required , even within short scenes . He handles the vocals with ease and a vibrancy that sometimes makes the melodies seem better than they are . * Also outstanding : triple-talented Dana Meller as a Sennett star who does better when talkies come_in ; a very funny Katie Zerga as Sennett ' s &quot; music_department &quot; ; Ryan James Orr as the watchman who sings that song about Mabel coming_into the room , and Matt Schliecher as an all-purpose combo silent film comic . Teeter ' s bright , fresh choreography , Todd Muffatti ' s settings , Robert C . Mumm ' s lighting , Juan Lopez ' s costumes , John R . Fisher ' s sound design and the makeup / hair designs of Natalie Carter are top-notch . * &quot; Mack and Mabel , &quot; Little Theatre , Cal State Fullerton , State College Boulevard at Nutwood Avenue , Fullerton .
