   <HEADLINE> ED BEGLEY NOMINATED TO SEAT ON LAND PANEL ; PARKS : RIORDAN CHOOSES ACTOR TO JOIN THE MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY BOARD . ANOTHER CANDIDATE , PETER IRELAND , WAS TARGET OF INTENSE OPPOSITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Film actor Ed Begley Jr . will expand his portfolio . Previously named to the city ' s Environmental Affairs Commission , Begley has been nominated by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy after weeks of speculation over who would represent the city on the park agency ' s board . If confirmed , as expected , by the City_Council , Begley will join the eight-member panel that sets policy for the conservancy -- a state agency that buys parkland in the Santa Monicas and neighboring ranges , including the Santa Susana Mountains and Simi Hills . The Begley nomination follows vigorous lobbying against Peter Ireland , who was a leading candidate but was targeted by a wide spectrum of opponents , ranging from pro-development interests to conservancy Executive_Director Joseph T . Edmiston and City Councilman Zev Yaroslavksy , a conservancy backer . Begley , 44 , a Studio City resident who starred in the television series &quot; St . Elsewhere &quot; and whose film credits include &quot; The Accidental Tourist , &quot; is &quot; especially qualified &quot; for the conservancy post , Riordan said in a letter to the council . The appointment seems likely to enhance the conservancy ' s image as park agency to the stars . In recent years , actors Warren Beatty and Peter Strauss and singer-songwriter Don Henley have aided the agency ' s land acquisition efforts . Barbra Streisand last month presented her Malibu estate to the conservancy to use as an environmental research_center . * As government panels go , the conservancy board does not have the highest profile . But the lobbying surrounding the appointment illustrates the intense interest in the agency ' s land preservation efforts within environmental and development circles . Supported by Councilwoman Laura Chick , Ireland sought the board post and &quot; was notified by the mayor ' s office that I had been given the appointment , &quot; he said . &quot; Subsequently , I was informed . . . that everything was_on hold and that things were being re-evaluated. &quot; William McCarley , Riordan ' s chief_of_staff , said Ireland was among several candidates , but declined to give details . Although other arguments may have been more persuasive , the campaign against Ireland included a false rumor that he was secretly being pushed by Soka University in an effort to stop the conservancy ' s efforts to acquire Soka ' s land by eminent_domain . Soka is trying to expand its campus into a 3 # 400-student university , a plan bitterly opposed by environmentalists . Rumors he was in_league with Soka were &quot; completely false and I ' m extremely disappointed someone would do this , &quot; Ireland said . &quot; We had a good laugh over it , &quot; said Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan of the allegation . &quot; As far as I know , Peter Ireland has never been a friend of Soka. &quot; The rumor seemed calculated to smear Ireland , said one Soka supporter . &quot; If you want to really ruin somebody ' s reputation in the environmental community , you accuse him of being soft_on Soka , &quot; he said . Edmiston said the rumor circulated among conservancy staff , but then was checked_out and found to be false . &quot; I certainly . . . don ' t think he ' s a dupe of Soka. &quot; * Ireland , 47 , until last spring worked for Edmiston as a high-ranking staffer with the agency . But budget_cuts reduced him to consultant status and last summer he became executive_director of the Mountains Restoration Trust , a nonprofit land trust that sometimes receives conservancy funds . Before long , Ireland and his former boss , Edmiston , were feuding over a conservancy-funded study on how the National_Park_Service could raise money for mountain parkland by selling the development credits that developers must buy to build_in coastal areas . Ireland ' s new shop , the Restoration Trust , had raised money itself through sale of development credits , and he voiced philosophical as well as practical objections to Park Service involvement . In August , Ireland angered Edmiston by outlining his objections in a long letter to Park Service Director Roger Kennedy . Ireland already had enemies on the other side of the fence -- among them property_rights and development advocates with whom he once was allied . Ireland ' s initial foray_into mountain politics was as leader of a property_rights group that fought park expansion . In 1981 , he parlayed that role into a staff position with County Supervisor Deane Dana , considered an ally of mountain developers . Ireland also became Dana ' s representative on the conservancy board . But he underwent a dramatic transformation from critic to ardent supporter of conservation efforts . In 1989 , he supported a secret strategy by the conservancy to permanently block the county from putting landfills in three Santa Monicas canyons -- without telling Dana , his boss . A short time later , Ireland left Dana ' s office for the conservancy staff . When word got_around last summer that Ireland was a leading candidate for the conservancy board , both his erstwhile property_rights allies and conservancy supporters stepped_forward to oppose him . Among other things , they said Ireland would have a conflict_of_interest because his group , the Restoration Trust , sometimes seeks conservancy funds for its land acquisitions . Don Knabe , Dana ' s chief deputy , said his office voiced reservations , but &quot; it wasn ' t anything hard-core -- that we started a campaign or anything like that. &quot; * Tom Bates , a Malibu real state broker , said he was urged by fellow conservancy critics to weigh in against Ireland -- but then heard conservancy supporters already had torpedoed him . Bates said he also heard the rumor of Ireland ' s supposed alliance with Soka , but considered it misinformation . Yaroslavsky said he opposed Ireland because of the potential conflict_of_interest . He said he did not want such &quot; side issues &quot; to divert the conservancy ' s attention during the current real_estate slump , which has given the agency &quot; a golden opportunity to acquire some of the most valuable open space in the country. &quot;</TEXT>
