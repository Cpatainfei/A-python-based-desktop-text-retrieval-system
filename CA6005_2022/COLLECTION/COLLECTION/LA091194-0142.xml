   <HEADLINE> OIL AND POLITICS MAKE FOR DANGEROUS MIX IN NIGERIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Notwithstanding President Bill_Clinton ' s heartfelt words that &quot; Africa matters_to the United States , &quot; the 1990s may become the decade of U.S. disengagement from Africa . Much of what happens in Africa is simply of no major consequence to U.S. strategic or economic interests . Nigeria -- and its struggle for democracy -- should be the exception . With 90 million people and abundant natural_resources , it looms as both a regional and continental military power looked_to by other African states to provide Pan-African security and stability . In the 15 months since the military government of Gen . Sani Abacha annulled the results of the country ' s first free civilian elections in more_than a decade and jailed the apparent winner , Nigeria has been in an economic and political tailspin . Its two powerful oil unions have undertaken a general strike to protest the continued rule of Abacha and the imprisonment of President-elect Moshood K.O. Abiola . Simply put , the oil workers have demanded the reinstatement of the election results , the unconditional release of Abiola and a series of industry-related reforms . Their weapon of choice -- withholding labor from the nation ' s premier industry -- was a potentially devastating tactic , given the Nigerian government ' s near-total dependence on oil revenues for subsistence . Last week , the unions unexpectedly suspended their strike , handing the Abacha government a temporary victory . But now the story may take a new turn , intersecting the goals of the Clinton_Administration and the economic interests of U.S. oil_companies . During the course of the strike , all foreign oil_companies were repeatedly asked by union leaders to suspend their operations in deference to , if not solidarity with , the Nigerian oil unions . Both U.S. and British companies rejected the request . Their operations allowed the military government to maintain a steady trickle ( reduced from a stream ) of oil revenue . In the eyes of the leaders of the National Union of Petroleum and National Gas Workers , the oil_companies are equally , if not more , culpable for the loss of life incurred by striking workers . In a broadcast in August , Abacha thanked &quot; our major partners in the oil_industry , and others , who under very strenuous and difficult circumstances have stood resolutely by us . We urge you to continue in this spirit. &quot; Apparently , Abacha ' s paean to U.S. and other foreign oil_companies was sufficient to clear their corporate consciences of any responsibility for supporting a repressive regime . Indeed , it appears U.S. oil_companies operating in Nigeria have demonstrated little concern for anything other_than their bottom_lines . Most consider their posture and practice to be apolitical . But human-rights and pro-democracy groups and unions have accused them of ignoring workers rights and of polluting the environment . A U.S. petroleum executive conceded that foreign companies can operate in Nigeria in ways they cannot do just a_few miles off the coast of California . The implications of oil-company complicity in Abacha ' s repression emerge into full relief against the backdrop of the Clinton_Administration ' s policy toward Nigeria . The Administration , recognizing that something must be done to end the crisis , has imposed limited sanctions , including restrictions on foreign_aid . High-level envoys have been , or will be , sent to pursue talks with Abacha . The cooling of U.S.-Nigeria relations is likely to continue as long as Abacha ' s regime remains in power and refuses to acknowledge and respond to the tide of democratic yearning sweeping his country . Rep . Donald M . Payne ( D-N.J. ) , a leading member of the House Africa Committee and the next likely chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , has directed the Government Accounting Office to determine the potential effects a U.S. embargo on Nigerian oil would have_on loosening Abacha ' s grip . The study ' s preliminary findings indicate that an embargo would not adversely affect the supply of oil in the United States . Any loss of Nigerian oil could readily be replaced with petroleum from the Baltics . As for its impact on Nigeria , the study concludes that U.S. action must be coupled with multilateral action to accomplish the intended result . Meantime , Abacha , buoyed by his apparent victory over the Nigerian oil workers , has begun to rule by decree . In the 24-hour period following the strike ' s suspension , he issued five decrees , one abolishing several newspapers , another allowing_for detention without charge or trial and a third declaring himself the ultimate and absolute authority with jurisdiction over all courts . Some Africa experts caution against unrealistic expectations for the success of U.S. sanctions or diplomatic measures . For a diplomatic resolution to occur , each party must have exhausted its best efforts at achieving its objectives , creating an impasse . Those conditions were present two weeks ago ; they are not today . Stronger measures may be necessary . No one is sure whether the Nigerian oil workers will resume their struggle for democracy -- time will tell . If we remember anything about the strike , it should be that the oil workers struck until the empty bellies of their children could no longer allow them to continue . The pennies more we now pay at the gas_pump is a much smaller price , and far smaller tribute , than their efforts deserve .</TEXT>
