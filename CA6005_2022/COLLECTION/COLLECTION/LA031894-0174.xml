   <HEADLINE> RABIN ASKS POPE TO AID PEACE PROCESS ; ARAFAT HOLDS_FAST ; MIDEAST : ISRAELI LEADER CALLS MOSQUE MASSACRE ' SHAMEFUL ' IN TALK WITH PONTIFF . PLO CHAIRMAN INSISTS ON INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION FOR PALESTINIANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Thursday asked Pope John Paul II to help win peace in the Middle_East , but Yasser Arafat , the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman , told a papal envoy that the talks could not resume without international protection for Palestinians . About the same time Rabin met the Pope here Thursday morning , Arafat spoke with Archbishop Jean Louis Tauran , the Vatican ' s foreign_minister , at PLO headquarters in Tunis , Tunisia . Like the United States , the Vatican wants to see resumption of talks , suspended after an Israeli settler massacred about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque on Feb . 25 . After meeting with Rabin on Wednesday in Washington , President Clinton appealed_to Arafat to resume negotiations to avoid allowing extremists to short-circuit the historic process . The Palestinian leader , though , made plain to reporters after conferring_with the senior Vatican diplomat that he was adamant . &quot; What is required now is that the United States , the two co-sponsors of the Middle_East peace process and the Security_Council respond to the just demands of the Palestinians to provide international protection to our children , our women and our holy_places , &quot; the Associated Press quoted Arafat as saying in Tunis . &quot; Our people have the right to know the council ' s opinion on the terrible massacre committed in the holy mosque . I need a clear answer to our demands. &quot; The United States , Arafat said , must allow the Security_Council to vote on a resolution on the Hebron massacre . The State_Department says the United States will not impede a vote , if the PLO returns unconditionally to the talks . The Vatican , which maintains embassies in more_than 100 countries , including most Arab states , has raised its profile in the Middle_East since agreeing with Israel in December to establish diplomatic relations . En route home from Washington , Rabin briefed the Pope on his talks with Clinton . &quot; At a time of crisis in the ( peace ) talks . . . my request to the Pope is essentially that he will give moral , religious support to a solution in the way of peace , in the way of negotiations , &quot; Rabin told reporters afterward . He said he asked John Paul to use his &quot; influence on hundreds of millions ( of his followers ) to support the peace process and to influence elements in the Arab world to return to the talks. &quot; An amicable half-hour meeting at the Vatican included renewal of a longstanding Israeli invitation to the pontiff to visit the Holy_Land . &quot; The Pope accepted the invitation , and said he hoped that circumstances will permit him to make this desired visit , &quot; papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said afterward . As reporters entered the room at the end of the private meeting in the papal apartments , John Paul was reiterating an oft-expressed wish to Rabin : &quot; I hope to be able to visit Jerusalem . . . . I hope , I hope. &quot; No date is yet in prospect for the trip . Leaving the audience , Rabin promised the Pope : &quot; I will make every effort to bring peace and prosperity to the Holy Land. &quot; Navarro said Rabin described the mosque massacre as &quot; shameful &quot; in his talk with John Paul . &quot; I am uncomfortable that for almost three weeks , 100 # 000 residents of Hebron are under curfew because of 415 Jews , &quot; Rabin told reporters . His government has banned two Jewish extremist groups , and Rabin said further action might be forthcoming against what he called &quot; insane and extreme elements &quot; among Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West_Bank . &quot; We have taken steps , and more steps will be taken , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
