   <HEADLINE> GARDENING Q &amp; A : GROWING THE MOST COLORFUL ROSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I ' ve heard that color intensity on roses can be improved by the addition of minerals or other substances . Is this true ? How can I improve or intensify the color of my roses ? ANSWER : Although too_much nitrogen fertilizer applied in the springtime may reduce the intensity of color_in early flowers , our Southern California soils usually contain enough minerals to sport optimal colors_in roses under normal conditions . Sometimes , however , adding Epsom salts ( one-quarter cup per mature plant ) may help ; and if leaves become chorotic , applying iron chelate greens up the foliage and increases flower color . The best flower color can usually be obtained in our area by 1 ) planting roses where they receive at least six hours of full sunlight per day ( the ideal is morning and mid-day sun with filtered late afternoon shade ) , 2 ) watering regularly and 3 ) feeding with a balanced plant food about every six weeks from early February through September . Do Citrus_Trees Really Attract Termites ? Q : A real_estate_agent advised me not to buy a house with citrus_trees planted near it , claiming that citrus_trees attract termites . Is this true ? A : Nothing in my own experience or in the literature substantiates this unusual claim ; so I asked pest control agents , and they said that citrus_trees are no more susceptible to termites than most other wood sources . The fact is that these dreaded pests -- particularly the subterranean and dry wood termites in inland areas , and the much larger dampwood or Formosa termites near the coast -- are well-established in Southern California , regardless of citrus or any other kinds of trees . So no matter where you choose to buy a house here , be sure to have it checked , and if necessary , treated for termites . Bugs Eat Strawberries Before They Can Ripen Q : We planted strawberries this year and have nurtured them well so we could have a good crop . However , it seems like the bugs get_to them just before they ripen , and most of them are spoiled . Is there anything we can do to beat the bugs without using poisons ? A : Although surprisingly little is written_about this common problem , there are some satisfactory solutions to your dilemma . You seem to be getting a good fruit set ; so the basic problem is to find a way to keep the fruit off the soil and away from the reach of the bugs -- usually pill_bugs , sow_bugs , earwigs and slugs . Commercial growers plant strawberries in raised rows covered by black plastic and water by flooding the furrows . Thus the developing fruit rests_on the side of the slippery plastic , and the pests are unable to reach it . At home you may also want to use this technique . Or you could place sturdy cardboard rolls ( or bricks or rocks , etc. ) under the sides of the plants to prop the berries up off the soil . Or mulch with coarse bark or rough gravel . It works best if the berries can simply hang_in the air . However , just keeping the berries up off the soil will significantly increase your viable harvest . ( This rule-of-thumb applies to other crops , such_as tomatoes , squashes , melons and anything which might develop at ground level. ) Flying , Black-Spotted Bug Eats Plant Greens Q : I have a major problem with bugs eating the greens on my vegetable plants and pumpkins , primarily a flying green bug with black spots on its back ( cucumber beetle ? ) . Nothing I ' ve tried has worked . Do you have a remedy ? A : You are correct in identifying this black-spotted green bug as a cucumber beetle . The recommended remedy is an application of Ortho Sevin Garden Dust to the foliage . This will eliminate beetle and caterpillar problems quite effectively , and it is relatively safe for humans . As always , please be sure to follow label instructions .</TEXT>
