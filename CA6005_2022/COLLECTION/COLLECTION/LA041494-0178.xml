   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO EXECUTIVE WROTE HOW TO BOOST NICOTINE LEVELS ; HEALTH : THE 1981 REPORT RELEASED BY A CONGRESSIONAL CRITIC CONTRADICTS INDUSTRY ' S POSITION . THE AUTHOR SAYS AN ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION IS BEING DRAWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The war against tobacco escalated Wednesday with the release of documents that appear to contradict the industry ' s oft-stated insistence that it does not manipulate nicotine levels in cigarettes . Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , Capitol_Hill ' s leading tobacco critic and chairman of a key House subcommittee , released a 1981 report written by a tobacco company executive describing how higher nicotine levels can be achieved in cigarettes by using specific blends of tobacco , and suggesting that these blends should be added_to low-tar cigarettes to significantly enhance their nicotine content . Yet , this same official , Alexander W . Spears , vice_chairman and chief operating officer for Lorillard Tobacco Co. , said in congressional testimony on March 25 that &quot; we do not set nicotine levels for particular brands of cigarettes. &quot; The issue has been an especially controversial one because of the highly addictive nature of nicotine . &quot; Once again tobacco_industry representatives have not only withheld information but they have misrepresented the truth , &quot; Waxman said at a press_conference . But Spears said in a statement that Waxman &quot; made a serious error in reasoning after reading my 1981 paper -- that is , he assumed that cigarettes with higher concentrations of nicotine in the tobacco result in higher yields of nicotine in tobacco smoke . . . . That assumption is incorrect. &quot; Meanwhile , after pressure from Congress , the tobacco_industry Wednesday released a heretofore secret list of chemical additives in cigarettes . R.J. Reynolds , which disseminated the list on behalf of six major U.S. companies , said in a statement that the additives &quot; are virtually the same as those found in many everyday foods and are not hazardous under the conditions of use. &quot; But Jim O ' Hara , a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration -- which is studying the issue of whether cigarettes should be regulated as drugs -- said that the industry was , in_effect , &quot; comparing apples with oranges &quot; by saying that the ingredients were safe because they were routinely added_to foods . In foods , such additives &quot; are not burned or inhaled , &quot; O ' Hara said . &quot; This doesn ' t say they are safe -- or unsafe , &quot; he added . &quot; It just doesn ' t speak_to the safety issue at all when these additives are used in cigarettes. &quot; Meanwhile , the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , which has been studying cigarette additives , said that the list is difficult to assess without knowing the specific amounts that are added or the recipes of individual brands . &quot; Based on the information we have , we can ' t come_to any conclusions , &quot; said Kent Taylor , a spokesman for the agency . Spears , who is scheduled to appear today with other high-ranking tobacco_industry officials before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment , which is chaired by Waxman , was specific in his 1981 article . He described how nicotine levels could be heightened in low-tar cigarettes by using more of the tobaccos with higher nicotine levels in the blending process . Waxman said that &quot; the American people are entitled to know what ' s going_on here . How do the tobacco companies maintain nicotine in tobacco at sufficient levels to sustain addiction ? What other methods are used to control nicotine levels ? The time for straight answers is here. &quot; Spears on Wednesday disputed allegations by Waxman and by the FDA commissioner , Dr. David A . Kessler , that companies may be adding nicotine to cigarettes and called tobacco blending &quot; a centuries-old process that is clearly documented in the published literature. &quot; The claims made by Waxman are &quot; based on misinformation and misunderstandings , &quot; Spears said . He said that the 1981 article was meant to analyze trends &quot; occurring in the market at that time and concluded that nicotine levels were higher in the very low tar and nicotine-yield cigarettes on a sales-weighted basis and that this was occurring because of blending. &quot; In releasing its additives list , the industry said that about 99 % of U.S. non-menthol cigarettes , by weight , contain primarily tobacco , water , sugars , glycerin , propylene_glycol , licorice , cocoa and additional flavors , with tobacco about 90 % of the total . Some specific ingredients that have come under question -- among them ethyl furoate , megastigmatrienone , maltitol and methoprene -- occur naturally in foods or have been approved by the FDA for use in foods , the industry said . &quot; Every ingredient on the list has been reviewed at the industry ' s request by an independent panel of expert toxicologists , &quot; R.J. Reynolds said . &quot; Their finding was that . . . every one . . . ( is ) safe in the amounts used. &quot; Cigarette Additives The eight chemicals among cigarette additives most questioned by tobacco opponents : * Megastigmatrienone : a flavoring tobacco companies contend is found naturally in grapefruit_juice and considered safe by the food industry . The Food and Drug Administration couldn ' t confirm that . * Dehydromenthofurolactone : a flavoring tobacco companies say is found in peppermint and considered safe by the food industry . FDA couldn ' t confirm that . * Ethyl furoate : found naturally in coffee , kiwi and peanuts . FDA hasn ' t formally ruled on the issue , but said the food industry considers it safe . But a toxicologist last week said the chemical can cause liver damage in laboratory animals . * Maltitol : a sweetener used in chewing gum and diabetic candy . The food industry considers it safe , but the FDA hasn ' t ruled on a petition questioning the safety . * Sclareolide : a synthetic form of a naturally occurring tobacco element . The food industry considers it safe . * Tobacco extract : used to boost flavor of reconstituted tobacco ; companies say it does contain a small amount of nicotine . * Ammonia : a processing aid . FDA considers certain forms of ammonia safe in foods but couldn ' t comment on the type in cigarettes . * Methoprene : an insecticide that toxicologists say is biodegradable and works by stopping insects from growing to adulthood . Tobacco companies say FDA allows it in dried fruits , but FDA couldn ' t confirm that . Source : Associated Press</TEXT>
