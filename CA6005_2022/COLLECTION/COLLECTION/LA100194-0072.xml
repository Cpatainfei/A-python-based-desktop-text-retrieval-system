   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; STOCKS MIXED AT QUARTER ' S END ; DOW OFF 11 ; MARKETS : BOND YIELDS EASE , BUT ANALYSTS SAY AN 8 % TREASURY RATE IS POSSIBLE SOON . WALL_STREET FEARS STOCKS ' REACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite soaring interest_rates , stocks posted surprising gains in the third quarter that nearly offset first-half losses -- and raised the tenor of the debate over what happens next . The Dow Jones industrial average , which rocketed in late summer to within a stone ' s throw of its all-time high , eased 11.44 points to 3 # 843.19 on Friday . Despite a selloff in the last two weeks , the Dow still finished_up 218.23 points , or 6 % , for the quarter and now is up 2.4 % for the year to date -- even as long-term bond yields hover just below 27-month highs , waiting for the economy ' s next move . Some broader market indexes posted bigger gains in the quarter . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks jumped 8.3 % , recouping most of its first-half loss and leaving it down just 1.6 % for the year so far . Indeed , analysts say the distraction of rising interest_rates may have caused many investors to lose track of how powerful a recovery stocks enjoyed in the quarter . Yet the split performances of U.S. stock and bond markets in the summer also are Wall_Street ' s greatest source of anxiety today . Unlike in winter and spring , when stocks dove as interest_rates jumped , share prices rallied in the third quarter even as rates pushed higher . With the 30-year Treasury_bond yield at 7.81 % on Friday , up from 7.61 % at the end of the second quarter and 6.35 % at Jan . 1 , many analysts believe that a_few more reports of strong economic_growth could be enough to push the bond yield to 8 % . That could happen in tandem with the next Federal_Reserve_Board move to raise short-term interest_rates , which some economists believe may occur even before the November election . Wall_Street ' s fear is that another surge in bond yields will spark a renewed plunge in_stocks , in part because institutional investors may decide to sell stocks and buy bonds should yields hit the psychologically important 8 % level . &quot; Our guess is that the whole world is making reservations to dine on an 8 % long bond yield , &quot; said William Dodge , market_strategist at Dean Witter in New York . A jump in yields could punch the Dow down as low as 3 # 550 , Dodge said . That would be an 8 % decline from Friday ' s close . David Shulman , strategist at Salomon Bros . in New York , believes the market is already in the midst of a sharper pullback on the order of 10 % to 12 % . The fact that it ' s October , a month with a nasty reputation for hosting market crashes , won ' t help investor psychology in the short run , he said . Yet some pros believe the fourth quarter will bring a rally rather than a dive , precisely because so many people expect trouble . &quot; I ' m bullish , &quot; says Ron Elijah , who has steered the Robertson Stephens Value Plus stock mutual_fund to a 15 % rise this year . Recent reports of continued economic strength &quot; are ancient history , &quot; he said . Investors &quot; are missing the point -- the economy is slowing_down , &quot; he contends . Once that becomes apparent in the fourth quarter , he said , &quot; the bond market will get better &quot; and stocks will enjoy a &quot; relief &quot; rally . Other money managers believe that healthy third-quarter corporate earnings_reports will have the same positive effect on stocks this fall that strong second-quarter reports had in the summer . But some Wall Streeters warn that , given the market ' s flat performance so far this year , it isn ' t clear whether stocks are forming a base from which a new rally will spring or a top that will give_way to a bona_fide bear_market . In other markets , third-quarter action was mixed : * Major European markets failed to follow Wall_Street higher . Frankfurt ' s DAX index was off 0.7 % for the quarter and remains_down 11.2 % for the year . London ' s FTSE 100 stock index , which jumped 33.8 points to 3 # 026.3 on Friday and gained 3.7 % for the quarter , is still off 11.5 % for the year . * Many Asian and Latin_American markets resurged in summer , after plummeting with U.S. shares_in the first_half . Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index rose 28.6 points to 2 # 746.11 on Friday , bouncing_back from a mid-week selloff that followed another political assassination . For the quarter , the Bolsa jumped 21.4 % . But Tokyo stocks , the first_half ' s global leaders , were hit by profit taking_in the third quarter . The Nikkei index fell 51.31 points to 19 # 563.81 on Friday and was off 5.2 % for the quarter . * In commodities trading , near-term gold futures closed at $ 394.20 on Friday , down $ 1 on the day . For the quarter , gold rose $ 8.40 , or 2.2 % , as the economy ' s resilience sparked new inflation fears . But the CRB index of 21 key commodities closed the quarter at 229.85 , down marginally from 230.03 on June 30 . * The dollar jumped compared to the Japanese yen Friday on optimism about a U.S.-Japan trade pact before the midnight deadline . The dollar rose to 99.15 yen in New York from 98.65 on Thursday , but it is only slightly above its July 1 level of 98.50. U.S. Stocks : Good Quarter , Flat Year Led by smaller stocks , Wall_Street rallied briskly in the third quarter despite rising interest_rates . But for the year to date most major U.S. stock indexes are down marginally , while foreign markets are mixed .
