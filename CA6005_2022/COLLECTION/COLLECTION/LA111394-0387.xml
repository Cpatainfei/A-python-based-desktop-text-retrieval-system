   <HEADLINE> WEEKEND ESCAPE : SAN FELIPE ; A CASUAL -- MAKE THAT FUNKY -- BAJA FISHING VILLAGE LURES A VISITOR TO ITS NEW RESORT , AND HOOKS HIM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Funky is not a word that translates well into Spanish , but that has never stopped this tiny Sea of Cortez fishing village from being the quintessence of good Mexican funk : a steamy , remote , no-frills playground that lures its visitors with bathtub-warm water and cheap seafood tacos . It ' s been my personal Margaritaville since the mid-1980s , when I started making the 350-mile drive from Los Angeles , usually at the height of summer , when the insane heat of Baja ' s interior coast has an almost transcendental effect -- sort of like Death Valley-by-the-Sea . As a rule , these have been low-budget affairs , the single largest expense -- apart from our bar tab -- being a $ 25 motel_room split two or three ways . Once , on a July 4 weekend , we joined hundreds of other revelers camping_out right on the beach , where the fusillade of firecrackers and bottle rockets didn ' t subside until dawn . Having savored this town on the down and dirty , I was skeptical when I learned that San Felipe was trying to refashion itself into a more upscale tourist destination . A new luxury resort with triple-digit prices opened last year to great fanfare and , in conjunction , the first international_flights began arriving_at San Felipe ' s dinky air strip . But I was also intrigued by the prospect : Could this sweltering seaside community draw enough free-spending visitors to sustain such a venture , or had some developer overestimated San Felipe ' s allure ? More importantly , would it be worth dropping big bucks for my wife and I to fly to a deluxe suite for the weekend , or would we be happier wallowing in funkiness for a fraction of the cost ? These were tough questions , but Raynelda and I decided we were up_to the task . Welcome Tours , one of many travel_agencies specializing in Baja vacations , provided us with a $ 690 package that included round-trip air fare on Air L.A. , two nights at the San Felipe Marina Resort &amp; Spa , a taxi between the hotel and airport , free breakfast and a welcome cocktail . Although the actual flying time from LAX to San Felipe is less than 1 1 / 2 hours -- a vast improvement over the grueling 6 1 / 2-hour desert drive -- we soon discovered that arriving by plane was anything but a breeze . As someone who can be mildly claustrophobic and a bit nervous about flying , I regretted not being heavily medicated before stepping onto our twin-prop , 19-seater , which was so cramped that we had to crouch , almost doubled-over , to get_down the aisle . Without the benefit of bathrooms , refreshments or flight_attendants , we felt more like thrill-seekers than vacationers on our way to a resort . The convenience of our flight was also dampened by a change of planes at the Tijuana airport , where we were forced to pass_through customs and immigration , even though cars headed to Mexico are waved across the border with hardly_a glance . Before re-boarding for a turbulent , seat-gripping flight to San Felipe , we had spent nearly an hour in airport limbo -- a sensation with which we unfortunately would become even better-acquainted on the trip home . My anxiety did not begin to melt until our plane landed at 2 p.m. Friday in the hot wind of San Felipe . This is extraordinarily beautiful terrain , a melding of arid desert harshness , the starkness of the towering San Pedro Martir mountains and the tropical flavor of a palapa-dotted coastline . Our taxi , which was briefly delayed by a herd of cattle meandering across the highway , took only a_few minutes to arrive_at the rust-colored Marina Resort , an angular , bunker-like development that is an odd combination of hotel , condo and time-share rental . Our beachfront room , a $ 143-a-night suite , was surprisingly stylish , decorated with fragile ceramic folk_art , woven Indian rugs on white tile floors and a well-appointed kitchenette , including microwave and blender . ( Prices , for two adults , range from a $ 100 basic room to a $ 165 junior suite . For six to eight people , master suites are available for $ 275. ) We wasted little time ordering that welcome cocktail , which we downed in the hotel ' s fabulous blue-tiled horizon pool , where the water drips over a jutting edge that seems to disappear into the shimmering Sea of Cortez . We were still so wound_up from our journey , though , that a quiet afternoon of poolside relaxation was totally out_of_the_question . Hopping a taxi for the three-mile trip into town , we eagerly embraced the San Felipe we knew best . We drank beer and cooled_off over a_few games of pool at the great old Club Bar Miramar . Out on the oceanside boardwalk , which is lined with a fantastic array of fresh seafood vendors , we feasted on fried-shrimp tacos -- sharing seven of them , plus two icy Tecates , for just $ 11 . Before the night was over , we had hit several more tequila joints , made plans to go fishing with a_couple_of seedy characters and danced to gangsta rap at Rockodile , a disco featuring a sand-filled volleyball_court that overflows with Americans and rich Mexicali teen-agers on most Saturdays . The next morning , after a breakfast of huevos rancheros and chilaquiles at the Marina Resort ' s outdoor palapa restaurant , we took a cab back to town and hunted_down our weathered fishing guide , Pancho , who had agreed to provide a 24-foot motor boat , poles , tackle and bait in exchange for $ 50 and an ample supply of beer . There are a_couple_of sport-fishing agencies in San Felipe that can hook you up with a licensed guide for about the same price , but Pancho proved an able_seaman , helping us catch about a half-dozen corvinas while a sudden thunderstorm pelted us with warm raindrops . After two hours , somewhat nauseated and tired , we asked Pancho to bring us back to shore , where we grabbed a taxi to the hotel and napped for the rest of the afternoon . We woke_up feeling relaxed and ready , at last , to appreciate the comforts of our superb lodging . * By San Felipe standards , prices at the 60-room Marina Resort are through the roof , but I ' ve also paid twice as much for a place in Laguna Beach that wasn ' t half as nice . Our room had a semi-private patio just a_couple_of yards from the nearly deserted beach . There was a glassed-in indoor pool , under a skylight , next to a lounge with wide-screen TV . The rustic , wood-beam dining hall was closed for remodeling , but our seafood dinner at sunset in the thatched-roof cafe outdoors was good . &quot; I don ' t even want to think_about going_back into town again , &quot; Raynelda said . We spent the rest of the night enjoying a warm breeze at the pool , floating on our backs as the inky sky filled with stars and bats darted overhead . Sunday morning we woke early , jogged on the long white beach and collected shells . We agreed that we could get_to like this new take_on San Felipe , which reminded us more of a Caribbean resort than the San Felipe we ' d known before . But our 1 p.m. flight brought us back to reality . In fact , the first leg of our return was pleasantly uneventful . But when we landed in Tijuana , our newfound tranquillity quickly unraveled . After changing planes , we were approached by an Air L.A. official who told Raynelda and me that we had to give_up our seats to make room for a group of connecting passengers . Our fellow voyagers , almost all_of them California travel_agents who had been guests of Air L.A. and the Marina Resort that weekend , were allowed to stay_on board . We , however , were unceremoniously booted off the plane and told to wait 3 1 / 2 hours for the next flight . The Air L.A. crew finally agreed to compensate us with two round-trip_tickets from Los Angeles to San Felipe , good anytime over the next year . I later found_out that it was a hollow gesture . As of Sept . 19 , Air L.A. ' s service to San Felipe has been canceled , leaving , for the moment at least , the old options of driving or taking an indirect bus_route .
