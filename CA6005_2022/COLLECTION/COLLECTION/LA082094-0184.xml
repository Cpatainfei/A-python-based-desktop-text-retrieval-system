   <HEADLINE> SMALL ON-LINE SERVICES OFFER OPPORTUNITY , MAYBE A PROFIT ; TECHNOLOGY : BULLETIN_BOARDS PROVIDE SUBSCRIBERS WITH A COZY , LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE TO PRODIGY AND COMPUSERVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For thousands of Southern Californians , the route to the information superhighway runs_through a spare bedroom in Greg Gooden ' s Van Nuys home . As_many as 60 people convene there at a time , using their personal_computers and telephone_lines to socialize , play games , use the library and pick_up their mail . Gooden ' s bedroom is the home of the Annex , one of tens of thousands of small computer bulletin_board services springing_up around the country . With start-up costs as low as a_few thousand dollars , bulletin_boards are a good entrepreneurial opportunity for the technically savvy -- and provide personal_computer users with a friendly , low-cost alternative to national on-line services such_as Prodigy , CompuServe and America Online . &quot; When you buy a modem , it usually comes_with a trial subscription to one of the national services like Prodigy , &quot; says Dale Porter , 31 , who runs a bulletin_board called KBBS out of his home_in Northridge . &quot; But when the trial period ends and Prodigy sends you this big bill , you realize it ' s time to start shopping around . that ' s how a lot of my customers find me. &quot; The mom-and-pop bulletin_boards -- of which there are now an estimated 57 # 000 nationwide , according to Boardwatch magazine -- have nowhere near the array of on-line publications , databases , and shopping opportunities that the national services offer . But small bulletin_boards can often provide a cozy electronic meeting_place for people with special_interests -- dentists , for example , or stamp_collectors . And local , general-interest bulletin_boards such_as the Annex and KBBS are a bargain for PC owners who simply want to meet people through electronic &quot; chat &quot; sessions , play games and send electronic_mail . CompuServe , for example , charges $ 20 to join and levies a monthly fee of $ 8.95. Customers get unlimited access to the basic services , such_as on-line publications and news files , but they can send only 60 mail messages a month without paying extra , and many of the more interesting services carry surcharges . The Annex and KBBS , by contrast , offer full use of their systems for a flat rate . KBBS has a one-year subscription , which limits users to 90 minutes of on-line time each day , at $ 9.50 a month . A comparable subscription at the Annex costs $ 8 a month . * Some see other benefits as well . &quot; One big attraction of a board like KBBS is its social character , &quot; says Sharon Landers , 32 , who has been a KBBS subscriber for two years . &quot; I enjoy chatting with other users . Basically it ' s an on-line community. &quot; KBBS and the Annex provide several channels where users can engage in live trivia games , group conversations or private chats . Customers can obtain games , spreadsheet and word-processing programs , and even buy products from an on-line shopping service . Subscribers can also send electronic_mail to others , including anyone outside the system who has an address on the Internet , the worldwide computer_network . For the proprietors , however , making bulletin_boards into profitable businesses is no easy feat . Gooden , a former office manager , logs 18-hour days surrounded by an array of computers , monitors and technical reference_manuals . And even though his board is relatively successful -- with 2 # 000 active users , it generates about $ 7 # 000 a month in subscription revenue -- all_the profits go_back into the system . Nationally , experts believe that only about 5 % of all bulletin_board_systems are profitable . * Eric Higgins , who runs the BrainStorm bulletin_board in Simi Valley , knows the financial challenges well . &quot; After four years . . . I haven ' t come_close to breaking_even , &quot; Higgins , 32 , said . &quot; Last year BrainStorm grossed $ 7 # 000 . But I spent $ 14 # 000 upgrading and adding new features. &quot; Fortunately , he has a full-time job as an engineer . &quot; I really don ' t mind dipping_into my own pocket to improve the system , &quot; Higgins said . &quot; I ' m convinced that the BBS industry has a big future , and I want to be a part of it. &quot;</TEXT>
