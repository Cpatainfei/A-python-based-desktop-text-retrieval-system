   <HEADLINE> INFLATION INDICATOR HOLDS LINE AT ZERO ; ECONOMY : BUT BOND YIELDS RISE ON ANOTHER REPORT SIGNALING POSSIBLE PRICE INCREASES AHEAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Consumer prices remained flat in January , the first month in which costs failed to rise in more_than four years , the Labor_Department reported Thursday . Economists said the zero growth in the consumer_price_index , a broad measure of ordinary living costs , reduces the need for the Federal_Reserve_Board to hike short-term interest_rates -- as the Fed did earlier this month -- to curb inflation . However , economists noted that the zero increase is somewhat misleading because the government is using a new method of calculation that is supposed to smooth_out seasonal fluctuations . Under the old method , the CPI would have risen 0.3 % in January . Even so , economists said , the report is encouraging because the underlying rate_of_inflation -- excluding the volatile food and energy sectors -- inched up a mere 0.1 % . Nonetheless , bond market yields -- which initially fell Thursday following release of the CPI report -- later rose to 6 1 / 2-month highs following release of a report signaling possible inflation ahead . The &quot; Business Outlook Survey &quot; by the Federal_Reserve_Bank of Philadelphia showed a large_number of companies reporting higher prices in February . Analysts said they were generally surprised by the reaction to the Philadelphia Fed report , given the positive consumer inflation news . Flat consumer prices -- if they help keep interest_rates low -- could be a balm to California , where economic recovery and job creation have lagged the rest of the nation , economists said . &quot; It ' s more invisible than one of your buddies being unemployed , &quot; said Joseph Wahed , chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . But if the value of money isn ' t eroding and interest_rates aren ' t climbing , he said , both consumers and businesses are in a better position to spur economic expansion . Showing the continuing discrepancy between Southern California ' s economy and the rest of the nation , consumer prices rose 0.2 % in the five-county metropolitan Los Angeles area . Higher housing costs led the way . Energy prices dropped during the month , both nationally and in the Los Angeles region , according to Labor_Department figures . Nationally , energy prices were down 0.8 % in January , reflecting a surplus of oil supplies on the world market , and gasoline prices fell 0.4 % after a 1.2 % December drop . Home heating_oil , electricity and natural_gas prices also declined . In the counties of Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and Ventura , costs of fuels and other utilities dropped 0.4 % from December . Gasoline prices were down 2.4 % in the region . James Padinha , an economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles , said that &quot; there are some weird things going_on &quot; causing fuel costs to fall , and &quot; we don ' t expect energy prices to keep doing this over the next months. &quot; Padinha expects the consumer_price_index in all_of 1994 to increase about 3 % , as it has in each of the last two years . * January ' s unchanged national index was the lowest since a similar report in August , 1989 . Analysts had expected an increase of 0.3 % in the CPI , following the 0.2 % growth in December . &quot; On the national scene , there ' s no question that inflation for the time_being is a non-event in America , &quot; said Wahed of Wells Fargo . Although the Fed has dropped broad hints that another credit tightening will occur soon , Wahed said : &quot; Now inflation is the last thing we have to worry about . Why beat a dead horse ? In the next few months , we can take_a_look at interest_rates again. &quot; Nationally , food prices fell 0.1 % in January , led by lower-priced fruits and vegetables , following a 0.5 % December rise . Entertainment and medical costs were key areas of higher prices , both up 0.3 % for the second straight month .</TEXT>
