   <TEXT> The vast majority of Latino immigrants in Los Angeles County are legal residents who work hard , earn relatively little , tend to live_in traditional family settings and are less likely than other low-income people to receive public assistance , according to a study scheduled for release today . The report is the first detailed examination of 1990 census &quot; microdata &quot; samples focusing_on the nearly 1.8 million Latino immigrants in the county , home to the nation ' s densest concentration of Latin_American immigrants , mostly Mexican-born but including Central_Americans and others . Previous studies have tended to view Latinos as_a_whole , lumping together U.S. native and foreign-born populations . The results are being released now , said David E . Hayes-Bautista , principal author and a UCLA-based sociologist , in an effort to counter what he called widespread misperceptions before the Nov . 8 election . On that day , Californians will vote on Proposition 187 , the ballot initiative that seeks to bar illegal immigrants from receiving public education and other tax-supported benefits . &quot; Numbers are better than shouts , &quot; said Hayes-Bautista , author of several pioneering studies on California ' s Latino population , who acknowledged his personal opposition to Proposition 187 . Apprised of the new study ' s results , supporters of the proposition questioned its findings , voicing suspicions about what they termed a deliberately narrow assessment of the illegal immigrant community . Los Angeles County is widely believed to have the nation ' s largest concentration of illegal immigrants . &quot; They ' re trying to make_it seem as though illegal aliens are not a big deal , &quot; said Harold W . Ezell , former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service Western states commissioner , who is an initiative co-author . The study was sponsored by the Alta California Policy Research_Center , a Los Angeles-based think_tank specializing in Latino issues that is headed by Hayes-Bautista . The authors call_for a return to an earlier civic largess that , they argue , benefited a poor population that migrated from other states and helped create the prosperity of post-World War II California . &quot; Investing in a youthful , hard-working , forward-looking population was a wise decision in the 1940s and 1950s , and is still the wisest approach to a more prosperous future for all , &quot; the report concludes . But Ezell rejected any comparisons between today ' s illegal immigrants and the migration of U.S. citizens to California after the war . &quot; What is this about ? &quot; Ezell asked . &quot; A full_employment plan for illegal aliens ? &quot; In line with other national studies of urban immigrants , the study depicts the Latino immigrant population as a kind of sociological paradox . Latino immigrants display some characteristics typical of the urban underclass -- notably high poverty rates and low education levels -- but also boast tightly_knit families , a strong work ethic and low use of public_services , all qualities not usually associated with the inner-city poor . Census data for 1990 shows that 3.3 million Latinos lived_in Los Angeles County , nearly 40 % of the 8.8-million total population . Latinos , their ranks bolstered by immigration and high birth_rates , are projected to represent a plurality by 2000 , surpassing non-Latino whites . * The report , extrapolating from census and INS data , estimates that fewer than 300 # 000 illegal immigrants from Latin_America were residing in Los Angeles County in 1990 -- a ratio of less than 1 in 5 of all Latino immigrants . &quot; There ' s some perception that if you ' re a Latino , you must be an immigrant , &quot; said Hayes-Bautista , who noted that only slightly more_than half of Los Angeles County Latinos are foreign-born . &quot; And there ' s a suspicion that if you ' re a Latino immigrant , you must be illegal. &quot; Alan C . Nelson , a former INS commissioner and co-author of Proposition 187 , disputed the findings . Closer to 50 % of Latino immigrants probably lack papers , Nelson said , which would mean that there were some 900 # 000 undocumented Latinos countywide -- more_than three times the new study ' s projection . Estimates based on studies by the INS and Los Angeles County put the county ' s undocumented Latino population at one-fifth and one-quarter of all Latino immigrants , higher than the new study . The authors of the study also assailed what they termed &quot; a widely disseminated image &quot; that Latino immigrants are &quot; welfare abusers. &quot; Only 16.9 % of poor Latino adult immigrants received public assistance in 1990 , the study noted , compared to 64.6 % of poor blacks , 50.4 % of poor U.S.-born Latinos , 48.8 % of poor Asians and 41.7 % of the comparable non-Latino white population . That is so , the study found , despite the fact that Latino immigrants are more likely to be poorer than anyone else . The average Latino immigrant household income of $ 29 # 989 was much lower than those reported for other groups : $ 52 # 375 for non-Latino whites , $ 49 # 042 for Asians , $ 43 # 777 for U.S.-born Latinos , and $ 32 # 813 for black households . One contributing factor to Latino immigrants ' poverty might be a lack of formal education -- something the authors trace not to a lack of interest but instead to a paucity of advanced schooling in rural Latin_America , most immigrants ' homeland . The study found that 70.5 % of immigrant Latino adults 25 and older had not completed high_school , by far the largest percentage of any group in Los Angeles County . By contrast , only 14.4 % of non-Latino white adults lacked high_school degrees , 20.7 % of Asians , 25.4 % of blacks and 35.3 % of U.S.-born Latinos . Overall , the authors concluded , Latino immigrants ' poverty is more a function of low wages than unemployment . Latino immigrants are actually among the county ' s hardest_workers , the data shows . Almost 9 of 10 ( 86 % ) of immigrant Latino men 16 and older participate in the workplace , the researchers found , far more_than any other group . Among women , the study found that slightly under half ( 49.2 % ) of all Latina immigrants 16 and older were in the work_force , compared to more_than 50 % of all other women . But the authors called the Latina employment ratio &quot; extraordinary , &quot; considering that they &quot; are many_more times likely to be married with_children &quot; than other women . Overall , immigrant Latino households are more typically composed of the classic nuclear_family -- a couple with_children -- than any other group , the researchers found . Almost half ( 49.6 % ) of immigrant Latino households constitute such families , compared to 16.4 % of blacks , 18.4 % of non-Latino whites , 30.7 % of U.S.-born Latinos and 38.4 % of Asians . Immigrant Study A new study of recently released 1990 census data for Los Angeles County has found that : * Fewer than 1 in 5 of Los Angeles County ' s Latino immigrants were here illegally , compared to other estimates of 50 % or more . * Almost 9 in 10 Latino immigrant men participated in the work_force . * Latino immigrant households were more likely than other county residents to be living_in poverty . * Poor Latino immigrants were less likely than low-income U.S. natives and other poor immigrants to receive public assistance . * More_than 70 % of immigrant Latinos 25 and older had not completed high_school , by far the largest percentage in the county . * Immigrant Latino households were more typically composed of the classic nuclear_family -- a couple with_children -- than any other population group in the county .
