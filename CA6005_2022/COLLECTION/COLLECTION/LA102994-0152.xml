   <HEADLINE> CIA ' S COVERT INDONESIA OPERATION IN THE 1950S ACKNOWLEDGED BY U.S. ; COLD_WAR : STATE_DEPARTMENT PUBLISHES UNPRECEDENTED 600-PAGE HISTORY DOCUMENTING ANTI-COMMUNIST PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first official acknowledgment of its kind , the State_Department has provided a detailed account of major covert_operations launched by the CIA in Indonesia during the 1950s , when it feared growing Communist influence over President Sukarno . A 600-page documentary history published this month shows that the Dwight D . Eisenhower Administration mounted clandestine intelligence_operations to support anti-Communist rebels in Indonesia in what was , in some respects , a forerunner of the Bay of Pigs operations against Cuba . William Z . Slany , the State_Department ' s official historian , wrote in an introduction that the new book represents &quot; a transitional volume on_the_road to fuller release of important intelligence_operations &quot; carried_out by the CIA . Until now , the official documentary histories of U.S. foreign_policy , which are called &quot; Foreign Relations of the United States , &quot; have been written as though the CIA did not exist . In an interview , Slany said that before the new Indonesia volume , State_Department histories had never published information about covert CIA operations -- with the single exception of some intelligence_activities in Vietnam in the early 1960s , when the United States was an overt and active participant in that country ' s civil_war . Indonesia was a more typical Cold_War intelligence_operation . Publicly , the United States maintained normal diplomatic relations with Sukarno ' s government in Jakarta . Meanwhile , the Eisenhower Administration secretly intervened in military_actions against him . Secretary_of_State John Foster Dulles said at one key meeting that Sukarno was &quot; dangerous , untrustworthy and by character susceptible to the Communist way of thinking. &quot; And so , in early 1958 , the United States began secretly supplying and supporting dissident military groups on Indonesia ' s outer islands of Sumatra and Sulawesi . &quot; There is ample evidence that the United States encouraged and supported the rebellion , until it was clear that it was failing , &quot; the State_Department historians concluded . Historians say the fact that the CIA mounted the covert_operations in Indonesia was already known . Indonesia began complaining about the CIA ' s activities after it shot down and captured an American pilot , Allen Pope , who was bombing military targets in support of the rebels . Howard P . Jones , American ambassador to Indonesia , later wrote a book in which he acknowledged , and criticized , the covert intelligence_operations . But the new State_Department book makes public for the first time the Eisenhower Administration ' s decision-making , the internal policy papers and accounts of the meetings at which the covert_operations were planned and launched . Then-CIA Director Allen Dulles sat in on all_the key strategy sessions , trying to manage the day-to-day details of an Asian land that he viewed through Western eyes . At one point , he told the National Security_Council : &quot; As a_people , the Indonesians often do a lot of talking , accompanied by very little action. &quot; By 1959 , when it became clear that the rebels would fail , Eisenhower shifted course . Instead of backing the rebels , he decided to throw U.S. support to the regular Indonesian army that had been fighting them -- in hopes that military_leaders would provide a counterweight to Sukarno and Indonesia ' s Communist_Party . Over the long term , that strategy was more effective . In 1965 , amid a mysterious flurry of attempted coups , Indonesian military_leaders led by Gen . Suharto took_control of the country , gradually easing Sukarno from power . Suharto remains Indonesia ' s president today . The State_Department history ends in 1960 , and there is no evidence in it of any CIA role in the military ' s 1965 seizure of power . &quot; After it ( the covert_operation in support of the Indonesian rebels ) failed in 1958 , we just backed_off , &quot; former CIA Director William E . Colby said in an interview . &quot; In the early 1960s , we had people there ( in Indonesia ) trying to find_out what was going_on but we didn ' t have any active cooperation ( with the Indonesian military ) . . . . Our problem . . . was trying to find_out what they were doing with the Soviets. &quot; The State_Department has been under pressure from Congress to provide more information about American intelligence_operations since the early 1990s . The American Historical Assn . criticized the State_Department for publishing a history of the restoration of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi of Iran to his throne in 1953 , without ever mentioning the CIA ' s well-documented role in returning him to power . In 1991 , Congress passed a law requiring the CIA and other intelligence agencies to cooperate with State_Department historians by giving them complete access to all information relevant to foreign_policy decisions . The Indonesia book is the first one in which the State_Department shows openly the extensive role of the CIA in the making of American foreign_policy . The Indonesia book also underscores the cozy relationship between the CIA and the press during the Eisenhower era . After American correspondents in Indonesia saw American pilots airdropping supplies to the rebels , the CIA director called executives at two publications seeking to keep the news from becoming public . In the end , one of the news_stories described the supplies as falling to the rebels &quot; like manna from heaven. &quot;</TEXT>
