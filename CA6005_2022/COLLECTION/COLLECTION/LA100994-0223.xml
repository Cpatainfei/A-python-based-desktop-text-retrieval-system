   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; A SON ' S DUTY ; LAN QUOC NGUYEN LEFT VIETNAM BEHIND . BUT HE WILL NEVER ESCAPE THE OBLIGATION HE FEELS TO HELP REFUGEES AND PROVIDE FOR HIS PARENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers office is almost invisible , tucked into a far corner of a strip mall on the edge of Little Saigon . Inside , it is spare , decorated only with posters extolling human_rights and postcards painted by Vietnamese refugees living_in Asian detention camps . On a hot Sunday , Lan Quoc Nguyen is about to settle in_for a typical day ' s work as the supervising attorney for the Southern California branch of LAVAS . He and his staff will again pick_up the often frustrating and labyrinthine job of reviewing case after case of a refugee who desperately wants asylum in a country -- any country . Nguyen , who escaped Vietnam by boat with his family and spent time in a Malaysian detention camp , believes this is his moral_obligation . On top of his general law_practice , he puts_in 30 to 40 hours a week at LAVAS . And he volunteers even more time as a guest on radio and TV_shows broadcast to the Vietnamese-speaking population in central Orange County , tailoring legal advice on everything from property law to traffic violations for an audience unfamiliar_with federal and state laws . There is no sense , however , that Nguyen is a careerist . His ground-floor Tustin law office is small , neat and functional -- hardly the sort of sanctum designed to impress or intimidate . He dresses neatly but without flash . And although his passions are genuine , he has lived with them for so_long -- through years of_his_own persecution and confinement -- that he speaks in matter-of-fact tones , with conviction but without missionary zeal . Between his high-profile pro bono work and his commitment to upholding Vietnamese tradition by living with and supporting his elderly parents in Westminster , Nguyen says , smiling , that he is barely making_it . &quot; But I ' m happy . that ' s more important . I spend long hours , but I think it ' s worth it . I do feel I have an obligation to the community to do this. &quot; * By the time he turned 14 , life in Saigon had become intolerable for Nguyen and his family . It was 1979 , and his father , a teacher , and oldest brother , a former soldier , were interned in &quot; re-education camps. &quot; &quot; Security was tight in the Vietnamese government at the time , and persecution was rampant , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; Any intellectual family couldn ' t do anything , and we had a black mark on our history because of ( supposed political activities ) by other members of the family . We were always under surveillance by the authorities. &quot; The rest of the family planned to escape by boat , but time and time again the attempts failed . &quot; You had to do everything secretly , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; Get a boat , find petroleum , get food and water , find people you could really trust . Some of the people would just rip you off and run , and you couldn ' t go_to the police. &quot; Seven times the plans went awry before the Nguyens could even get_to a boat . Family members were turned_in to authorities , jailed and later released . Finally , on the eighth try , the seven boys and their mother sailed away on a small_boat with several other families . During seven days at_sea , they ran_out of fuel and water before taking_on other refugees from a smaller_boat with an abundance of both . After weathering a fierce storm , the boat landed at Malaysia . The Nguyens were immediately processed into a detention camp , where they lived for 10 months before transferring to a transit camp in Kuala Lampur . After two months there , they emigrated to the United States with the help of sponsors in Orange County . Nguyen ' s father was finally released in 1990 from the camp in Vietnam ( the oldest brother had escaped with the others ) , but the government refused to allow him to join his family . He got a tourist visa to East_Germany at about the time the Berlin Wall came_down , Nguyen says . &quot; When he arrived there he crossed into West_Berlin , went_to the nearest American embassy and applied for asylum . &quot; When I passed the bar , he was my first client . I was scared to death , because if I lost that case I didn ' t know what I was going_to do. &quot; Nguyen , a graduate of Hastings Law_School in San Francisco , won his father ' s case . And with the family reunited , he was free to &quot; work fully on behalf of refugees without worrying about retaliation against ( my family ) by the Vietnamese government. &quot; * Nguyen ' s experience as a refugee &quot; is what I think drives him , &quot; says Van Tran , who also works_at LAVAS . &quot; He ' s seen as very committed , a very bright attorney who has a deep concern for the welfare of the refugees -- his own people -- as well as the community welfare . &quot; Lan is a person with a conscience , and that ' s what I find appealing about him . He doesn ' t forget his roots as a boat person . He ' s definitely one of the key members of the future generation of Vietnamese Americans in this community , and we can expect him to contribute more as the years go by. &quot; Tony Lam , mayor pro_tem of Westminster and the first Vietnamese American elected to public office in the United States , calls Nguyen ' s commitment to pro bono work amazing . &quot; He could be making a much better living at ( his practice ) , but he spends so_much time at LAVAS . I really credit him for that . He has a lot of passion and compassion . He ' s already earned the respect and affection of the community here. &quot; The need for refugee advocacy , Nguyen says , is more urgent than ever . The asylum-seekers , he says , would almost surely face persecution in Vietnam as political undesirables . And under a deadline agreed upon by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and U.N. member nations , the camps will close at the end of this year unless an extension is granted . Thousands of refugees may face forced repatriation . Hunger_strikes in protest of the policy are now common in the Asian camps , he says . Some of the about 50 # 000 refugees there , believing themselves beyond hope , have resorted_to self-immolation , hanging or poisoning . &quot; Many of them would rather die than return to Vietnam , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; Legal abuse over there is so rampant . Under international_law , they ' re no longer recognized as official refugees . It ' s an unfair rejection of their refugee status . So it ' s not really an immigration problem now ; it ' s a human_rights problem . that ' s where we come in. &quot; Nguyen and his staff at the Westminster office of LAVAS , which is headquartered in Virginia , have confronted massive and sometimes impenetrable bureaucracies on behalf of about 230 clients with contacts in Orange County . &quot; Essentially , &quot; Nguyen says , &quot; we work_on a specific person , but along the way we also engage in some ( general ) advocacy , speak out on the part of refugees and asylum-seekers. &quot; The process most often begins , he says , when someone comes_to the office to ask_for help in getting a friend or relative out of a camp . If Nguyen determines a case has promise , he files appeals for refugee status with the review board in the country where the asylum-seeker is being detained , with the U.N. High Commission for Refugees or with the U.S. State_Department , depending_on how far previous appeals have gotten . Nguyen and his half_a_dozen associates only handle cases that have been rejected at least once . They win about 80 % of the cases they take_on in the Hong Kong camp and about 45 % in the Philippines camp . The percentages vary among countries , Nguyen says , because some authorities make their job easier than others . To see for himself how things work , Nguyen traveled at his own expense to the Philippine detention camp known as Palawan in 1992 . Joining international volunteers there , he began processing cases from the day of his arrival , often working outdoors in stiflingly hot and humid weather . &quot; Palawan is one of the best camps in the region , &quot; he says , &quot; but the living conditions are still very difficult . Families live_in a very small space : 12 feet square for a family of three or four , with all_the facilities there . They cook there , and much of the food is rotten . All communications with the outside world are censored . There ' s no work , and people have nothing to do. &quot; * It is Wednesday morning , and Nguyen is half an hour from his departure to Long_Beach , where he is_due in court . At the moment , however , he is wedged into a corner of a tiny studio at the offices of Little Saigon Radio and Television in Santa Ana . During his weekly call-in show from 9:30 to 10 on KWIZ ( 96.7 FM ) , he usually answers about 20 calls_on legal matters . On this day , he will also explain in Vietnamese how property_taxes work . &quot; I ' m going_to be talking_about how people can apply for a reduction on their property_taxes , &quot; he says . &quot; A lot of people don ' t know they can do that . Next week , I ' m going_to talk_about what to do if people get stopped for a DUI. &quot; He gets no pay_for the radio show or for the 15-minute legal advice TV spot he does biweekly on KRCA Channel 62 . In the eight months since their start-up , they have become among the stations ' most popular shows . &quot; I find his programs very , very educational , &quot; says LAVAS co-worker Tran . &quot; There ' s a great need for that in our community because . . . many of us are newly arrived , and we may be intimidated by the legal_system here. &quot; Diem Do , who hosts shows on Little Saigon Radio and Television dealing with youth and human_rights issues , says he and Nguyen often exchange ideas about their programs and occasionally appear together . Nguyen has come a long way , Do says , and many of his listeners can relate to that . &quot; He came_with nothing , had lost everything , came_to a strange land not knowing the language , being_on the bottom of society , having to fight his way up . He has a lot of good ideas , and he ' s a man with a good heart . I think what he ' s been through helps him relate better to a lot of people. &quot; Nguyen says he enjoys his time in the broadcast booth , partly because it involves research . &quot; I can ' t just get a lot of this stuff off the top of my head . It helps me learn. &quot; That thirst_for_knowledge , and the passion to use it , drove Nguyen even before his arrival in Orange County . &quot; When I was in the camp , &quot; he says , &quot; I always had a desire to become one of those people who helped . It ' s very emotional for a boat person to return to a camp and do that . During my time in the camp , my education was still in my mind . And when I was in law_school , I did research in international_law . The refugees were my major concern. &quot; And will continue to be , Nguyen says : &quot; Even though they say they ' re closing the camps , there may be some people still there . So we ' ll continue to work. &quot; And Nguyen will continue to divide his time . &quot; The guy ' s really intelligent , &quot; Do says , &quot; and he could be really successful in his ( private law_practice ) , but he diverts his time and energy to so many other things . He ' s managed to find the time to do that . Money is not the only thing in his life . &quot; I think all that he gives_back to the community is what really enriches his life. &quot; Lan Quoc Nguyen Age : 30 Native ? : No ; born in Saigon , Vietnam . lives in Westminster . Family : Single . One of seven sons of Hoi Thuc Nguyen and Lan Thi Pham , whom he supports . Passions : Helping Vietnamese asylum-seekers and immigrants , reading , visiting friends . On bringing his father to the United States : &quot; When I passed the bar , he was my first client . I was scared to death , because if I lost that case I didn ' t know what I was going_to do. &quot; On reuniting with his father after an 11-year separation : &quot; My mother and brothers went_through a lot , but we didn ' t know what he went_through during those years . We had to fill each other in . It took a long_time to get used to it. &quot; On his commitment to helping asylum-seekers : &quot; I spend long hours , but I think it ' s worth it . I do feel I have an obligation to the community to do this. &quot;</TEXT>
