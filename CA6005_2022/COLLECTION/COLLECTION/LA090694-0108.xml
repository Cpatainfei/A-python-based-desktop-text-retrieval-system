   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM : LOOKING_AT A ' SOFTER SIDE OF HONG KONG '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With &quot; The Softer Side of Hong Kong : The Films of Stanley Kwan and Clara Law , &quot; the Monica 4-Plex will present on Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m. throughout the rest of September four films simultaneously , one for each of its screens . Law ' s &quot; Farewell , China &quot; ( 1992 ) presents the harshest view of life in New York imaginable -- so_much for &quot; softer. &quot; Frustrated by the lack of educational opportunities during the Cultural Revolution , a young wife and mother ( Maggie Cheung ) perseveres mightily until she at last obtains a visa to continue her studies in international trade_in the United States . Never mind that it defies credibility that she ' d head for Manhattan without any contacts whatsoever ; what lies_in store for her is terrifyingly believable . Shocked to be asked_for a divorce and then losing contact with her completely , her loving husband ( Tony Leung ) follows her to New York , entering the country illegally . &quot; Farewell , China &quot; takes_on raw , epic dimensions as Leung ' s desperate search for Cheung is intercut with flashbacks to what has been happening to her . What emerges is a portrait of Chinese immigrants struggling to survive under truly terrible conditions . Again supported by Leung , Maggie Cheung also stars in Kwan ' s &quot; Actress &quot; ( 1992 ) , a remarkably perceptive film biography of Ruan Ling-yu , who was as mesmerizing as she was ill-fated . Ruan was one of the greatest actresses ever to face a camera , combining the delicacy of Lillian Gish with the sensuality of Greta Garbo . The daughter of a servant and the scion of the rich family for whom her mother worked , Ruan was dogged throughout her all-too brief career by publicity surrounding her birth and later on , her love life . Kwan ' s &quot; Rouge &quot; ( 1988 ) is an exquisite supernatural fable , an opium dream of a movie that re-creates glamorous Hong Kong of the ' 30s and then plays it against the city ' s teeming , workaday present to illuminate and contrast the changing relationships between men and women . The story focuses_on the ravishing Fleur ( Anita Mui ) , whom we first meet in 1933 in a luxurious brothel and then see again in 1987 , inexplicably not looking a day older and apparently searching for a long-lost lover . &quot; Rouge &quot; turns_upon the old Chinese belief that a day in the spiritual_world is roughly equivalent_to 50 years on earth . As Fleur and her weak-willed lover ( Leslie Cheung ) embrace , in an old movie-style close-up , Kwan pans to the glittering skyline of 1987 Hong Kong , and in that moment we are whisked more_than a half-century forward as the still-youthful Fleur enters a newspaper office to place a notice in the personals column . What emerges from Kwan ' s shifts between past and present is a protest of the folly of women , who , out of ingrained custom , sacrifice themselves for men unworthy_of them . There ' s also a strong feminist flavor to Clara Law ' s ravishing &quot; The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus &quot; ( 1989 ) , an erotic , romantic fable set simultaneously -- and seamlessly -- in the past and in the present . Law is a real virtuoso , bringing terrific visual flair to boldly stylized glimpses of antiquity only to cut_to the fast , decadent , hard-edged luxury possible in today ' s Hong Kong -- and all_the while shaping her actors ' portrayals precisely to her purpose . The lovely Joi Wong stars as a ballerina in China who becomes increasingly convinced that in an earlier life she was known as the Golden Lotus , who becomes entangled with her brother-in-law as well as a lover . It ' s a predicament that Law feels unfairly earned Wong , in Chinese myth and literature , the designation as &quot; the No . 1 slut in ancient Chinese history. &quot; * Meanwhile , the Hong Kong Premiere Showcase also continues at the Monica 4-Plex with &quot; The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk II , &quot; which opens Wednesday for a one-week run . A lively , successful sequel that again shows_off the uninhibited imagination of director Corey Yuen and his writers , it finds our blithe , acrobatic hero ( Jet Lee ) involved in the anti-Manchu Red Flower Society and a potential romantic triangle . As before , the sensational comedian Josephine Siao is back as Lee ' s lusty martial artist mother in this delightfully knockabout period . Information : ( 310 ) 394-9741 .</TEXT>
