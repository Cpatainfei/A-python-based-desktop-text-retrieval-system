   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON JUDGE ITO ; IT ' S GOOD TO PUT A HUMAN_FACE ON A GOD-LIKE ROLE ; GIVEN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT PUBLIC_SERVANTS , ITO ' S TV APPEARANCES SHOULD BE A CREDIBILITY BOOSTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The latest firestorm in the O.J. Simpson trial concerns whether Judge Lance A . Ito acted improperly in granting an interview to a local television_station . This controversy is laden with ironies . After repeatedly criticizing the media ' s obsession with the case , Judge Ito ' s own cooperation with the media is , for now , the big story . At the same time , some commentators who previously criticized Ito for being media-phobic , are now lambasting him for doing the interview . Although the ironies are interesting , they mask the basic point : Ito ' s interview will not compromise a fair trial and is enormously important to inform the public about the human_being who will be handling the most widely publicized case in American history . The interview is being shown in five parts over the course of this week . Ito has carefully avoided discussing any aspect of the case . Certainly , it would be inappropriate for him to comment on the evidence or arguments in the_matter . But he has not , and from all accounts , will not do that . His comments the first night focused_on his family background and especially on the experience of his Japanese American parents who were uprooted from their home_in California and interned in Wyoming during World_War_II . He has also discussed his feelings about his new-found celebrity status and his views about what makes a good judge . Neither the prosecution nor the defense has been harmed in any imaginable way by these comments . Not even the harshest critics of the interview have suggested that Ito ' s comments will interfere with a fair trial . The interview , however , is very beneficial in that it helps people to see Ito , and judges generally , as human_beings . With rare exceptions , people know little about occupants of state and federal_courts . The courtroom setting , with a black-robed judge sitting on a raised bench , makes judges seem more God-like than human . Ito ' s appearance on the TV interviews allows people to see the jurist as a person with a family , a cultural background and human interests . The pictures of his childhood make_it much easier for people to view him not as an oracle of the law , but as a person . Thus far , the interviews have shown him to be articulate and thoughtful . His moving description of his parents ' experience in internment helps explain why he is a judge and his commitment to fairness . This only can help enhance the credibility of his rulings and , more generally , improve the image of the judiciary . The interviews could not have come at a better time . After one of the ugliest election campaigns in memory , which gave little reason to feel confidence in , let alone warmth toward , government officials , the interviews engender respect for an important part of the government . Nor are the interviews unprecedented . The Los Angeles Daily Journal , a newspaper covering the legal_system , regularly profiles judges and they frequently are quoted . During the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution in 1987 , Justice Harry Blackmun was interviewed by the television_show &quot; Superior_Court &quot; and the interviews , which also were shown over a week , revealed a self-effacing , highly intelligent man . Judge Ito was interviewed earlier in the Simpson trial by several newspaper reporters and no one objected . Some call Ito a hypocrite for objecting to the extensive press coverage and then fueling the media circus by doing these interviews . But I think that Ito ' s error was in his earlier remarks attacking the media , not in his current behavior . At times , Ito has seemed to engage in a battle with the press , referring to the media derisively as &quot; jackals , &quot; sending letters to media executives trying to control their stories , and even at one point barring the press from the courtroom during jury selection . I hope that these interviews represent a thawing in that frosty relationship . The reality is that the Simpson trial is , has been , and will continue to be a major news_story . More people will learn about the law and the legal_system from this case than from any other single event in American history . Rather than criticize or ignore this reality , this week ' s TV interviews use the press spotlight to an important benefit : helping people to see judges as human_beings .</TEXT>
