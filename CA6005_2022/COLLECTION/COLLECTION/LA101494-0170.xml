   <HEADLINE> WHOLESALE PRICES DIP , EASING INFLATION FEARS ; ECONOMY : FIGURES ARE SURPRISING AFTER HEFTY INCREASES OF JULY AND AUGUST . WALL_STREET STARTS OFF GIDDY , CALMS_DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wholesale prices took a surprising fall_in September , their biggest month-to-month drop_in more_than a year , the Labor_Department reported Thursday , temporarily easing investor fears that inflation is getting_worse . The producer_price_index for finished goods fell 0.5 % from August on a seasonally adjusted basis , due mainly to lower energy and food prices and an unexpected fall_in the price of automobiles , the department said . It was the largest decline since a 0.8 % drop_in August , 1993 . The decline was especially surprising because it came_on the heels of a 0.5 % increase in July and a 0.6 % jump in August . Through September , wholesale price inflation was running at a 1.9 % annual rate . Even when volatile energy and food prices were excluded , the so-called core component of the index increased only 0.1 % in September , well below both economists ' expectations and August ' s 0.4 % increase . &quot; It shows that inflation really doesn ' t look as bad as everybody thought , &quot; said Labor_Department economist Scott Sager . &quot; This month ' s report should put a lot of fears to rest. &quot; Investors initially welcomed the news before moderating their enthusiasm later in the day in anticipation of key government price and economic reports due out today . The Dow Jones industrial average soared more_than 50 points in the first 15 minutes of trading , triggering the New York Stock_Exchange ' s program-trading controls , before settling_down and closing 14.80 points higher at 3 # 889.95. Similarly , the 30-year Treasury_bond yield dropped to 7.85 % from 7.90 % on Wednesday . Earlier in the day , the yield -- a bellwether of long-term interest_rates -- fell as low as 7.76 % . How significant is Thursday ' s news ? That will depend in part on a raft of indicators to be released today , including September consumer price data , manufacturing production and retail sales numbers . Economists doubted the consumer_price_index would reflect the sharp decline in wholesale prices , at least not yet . In any case , economists believed that Thursday ' s news would not deter the Fed from boosting short-term rates again when its rate-setting Open Market Committee meets Nov . 15 . They foresaw the Fed bumping_up rates between a quarter to half a percentage_point . &quot; I think ( August ' s ) producer_price_index probably grossly exaggerated how high inflation was , and this one overstates the weakness in inflation , &quot; said Anthony Chan , chief economist at Banc One Investment_Advisors in Columbus , Ohio . &quot; We ' re probably somewhere in the middle. &quot; Falling energy prices contributed most to the decline in the producer_price_index , Sager said . Prices of finished energy goods , including gasoline and heating_oil , fell a sharp 2.9 % in September , their biggest decline since December . Prices also declined for residential electric_power after rising in August . The declines reflect a worldwide glut of crude_oil on the world market relative to demand , Reaser said . One of the surprises in the index was the fall_in the price of passenger_cars , since the industry has been touting its lean inventories . They dipped 1.1 % in September , the largest decline since a 2.6 % drop_in October , 1993 , the Labor_Department said . They had increased 0.7 % in August . The decline was all_the more striking since the figures are seasonally adjusted , taking_into_account the normal price declines that come_with the end of the automobile model year . Auto_makers competing for year-end business have been discounting their leftover 1994 models more_than usual in an attempt to clear them out before 1995 models arrive , analysts said . Prices for finished foods dropped 0.2 % after rising 0.7 % in August . The largest component of that was coffee , which reported a record 10.3 % drop_in prices . Prices of roasted coffee had soared 12 % in August and a whopping 42.8 % in July in the wake of damaging frosts in Brazil . Separately , the Labor_Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to 314 # 000 in the week ended Oct . 8 , from a revised 319 # 000 the week before .
