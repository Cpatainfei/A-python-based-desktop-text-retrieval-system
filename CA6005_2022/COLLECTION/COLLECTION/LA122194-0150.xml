   <HEADLINE> INTEL , IN SHIFT , TO OFFER FREE REPLACEMENT OF FLAWED CHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reeling from an unprecedented consumer uproar , Intel Corp . reversed course on Tuesday and offered free replacements for its flawed Pentium computer chip along with a &quot; sincere apology &quot; for its botched handling of the situation . Intel , one of the nation ' s largest and most profitable high-tech companies , had tenaciously resisted such a move for weeks , arguing that the Pentium flaw was a minor problem affecting only a_few scientists . But analysts say Intel failed to recognize that the personal_computer business has become a consumer products business -- and customer expectations have changed accordingly . The belated mea culpa could cost Intel as much $ 1 billion , and it promises months of chaos in the PC world as consumers and vendors scramble to replace millions of Pentium chips . It remains unclear whether Intel will be able to avoid lasting damage to its reputation and its position as the dominant supplier of microprocessors , which form the brains inside personal_computers . Intel President and Chief_Executive Andrew S . Grove is widely regarded_as one of the most brilliant men in American business , but over the last several weeks analysts say he has failed to understand the simplist of business maxims : the customer is always right . Speaking in an early morning conference_call with reporters and analysts Tuesday from company headquarters in Santa Clara , Calif. , Grove admitted that Intel had mishandled the issue by , for example , grilling consumers who wanted replacements to see if the replacement was really necessary . &quot; To some people this seemed arrogant and uncaring ; we apologize for that , &quot; Grove said . Intel ' s apology and offer to replace the chip without questions asked will be published in national newspapers in America , Japan and Europe beginning today . The Pentium problem emerged last month when a Virginia math professor said Intel ' s newest and most elaborate microprocessor made mistakes in certain division calculations . Intel then disclosed that it had known about the problem since last summer . That admission infuriated many customers , who took_to the Internet computer_network to air their indignation . Major newspapers then began to report the problem , and IBM Corp . sounded another alarm last week when it said it would stop shipping Pentium chips . All of this was a rude awakening for Intel , which had been accustomed to dealing with technically sophisticated buyers who were willing to accept a certain level of flaws in a chip . Consumer outrage expressed over electronic_mail and in tens of thousands of phone_calls to Intel ' s hot_lines played a key role in the company ' s change of heart , according to Intel insiders . &quot; Intel has been an engineering driven company and they took a hard-core engineering stance , &quot; said John Lazlo , analyst at Paine Webber . &quot; It proved to be the wrong stance and they had to eat their words. &quot; Admitted a somewhat befuddled Grove : &quot; What we view_as an extremely minor problem has taken_on a life of its own. &quot; But even as he apologized , Grove warned that leading edge microprocessors like the Pentium are so complex &quot; testing methodology cannot ensure that all errors will be caught. &quot; Such admissions are a surprise to many consumers who have equated high_technology with high accuracy . &quot; This represents a loss of innocence for consumers buying computers , &quot; said Paul Saffo , director of the Institute for the Future , a Menlo Park-based think_tank . &quot; It will be a long_time before buyers trust computers or computer manufacturers again . People can ' t assume that just because it ' s in silicon it is accurate. &quot; Intel itself has been a leader in the drive to make the PC a consumer product , and it has deliberately sought to build its own brand name with the $ 150-million &quot; Intel Inside &quot; advertising_campaign . But it will now have to work hard to repair its image on two fronts : with consumers who might associate the company with the flawed chip , and with personal_computer manufacturers who have long resented Intel ' s power and are furious over the way the company has handled the Pentium problem . While IBM and Compaq Computer said early on that they would replace Pentium chips for any of their customers , other vendors , including Dell , AST Research and Gateway 2000 , stuck_by Intel ' s assurances that there was no problem -- and now look foolish for doing so . How effectively Intel redeems itself may depend_on its handling of the messy logistics of responding to millions of consumers likely to demand replacements . The company is working its employees seven days a week to get a corrected chip into full production , but the reality is that there won ' t be enough of the &quot; clean chips &quot; to go_around for some time . Intel said there was a 60-day waiting_list for replacing chips even before the announcement was made . That list could easily lengthen . Jerry Banks , an analyst for Dataquest , a San Jose-based research firm , estimates that Intel will ship 8 million of the flawed chips before it converts completely to production of the corrected versions . He believes that all 3 million of the corporate buyers of the chips will eventually demand replacements while about 1 million of the 5 million consumer users will ask_for replacements . With each replacement_costing Intel up_to $ 200 , Banks estimate the total cost to Intel at up_to $ 800 million . On the low side , John Lazlo , a Paine Webber analyst , estimates the cost at $ 150 million to $ 200 million . Those costs value the chips_at production_cost of about $ 30 a piece and don ' t include the lost &quot; opportunity_cost &quot; from having to divert chip production for filling replacement orders rather than selling them for their market_value of $ 500 to $ 1 # 000 apiece . Opportunity_costs could be in the billions of dollars , analysts estimate . Intel will take an unspecified charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to cover the costs . Retailers , who are looking anxiously over their shoulders to see if the Intel flap will hurt Christmas sales , said they are content with the Intel move . &quot; Intel ' s put the whole_thing to rest today , &quot; said Jim Halpin , chief_executive_officer of CompUSA , the largest chain of computer_stores . &quot; If a customer wants a new chip , Intel will replace it. &quot; Halpin angrily blames &quot; reporters and analysts &quot; for exaggerating the importance of the flaw and insists that the task of replacing chips will be a simple one that can be handled by existing in-house technicians . PC makers are hiding their annoyance . &quot; It ' s a significant business distraction , &quot; says Michele Moore , spokeswoman for Dell computer . &quot; We ' ve had to incur additional costs . It hasn ' t been an easy situation. &quot; Moore said the cost of replacing chips would be &quot; either born by Intel or be immaterial. &quot; But these are the same PC makers and retailers who have been telling consumers all along that flaws in the Pentium chip were not a serious concern . &quot; Shoppers might be scratching their heads about what they heard from ( shops ) last week , &quot; said Dan Ness , analyst at Computer Intelligence Infocorp , a La Jolla-based marketing company . Corporate computer buyers could face significant costs . Carter Lusher , a vice_president covering personal_computers for Gartner Group , says it will cost from $ 31 to $ 289 per computer for companies to find the flawed computers and make the necessary changes even if they get the chip from Intel free . &quot; There is no way Intel can make this a purely painless upgrade , &quot; said Lusher . * CHIP FALLOUT : Tips for buyers and users .
