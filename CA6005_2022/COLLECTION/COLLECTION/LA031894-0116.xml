   <HEADLINE> TEXACO UNDER STATE INVESTIGATION ON SPILL ; VENTURA : FISH AND GAME_WARDEN ALLEGES THAT EMPLOYEES WAITED TO REPORT THE 370 # 000-GALLON LEAK . OFFICE RAID DISMAYS COMPANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Texaco employees discovered one of the county ' s largest oil-related spills long before they reported it to authorities last year and then tried to pass the blame to neighboring oil_companies , state investigators allege . In a search_warrant affidavit , a state_Department of Fish and Game_warden alleges that Texaco officials waited to report the 370 # 000-gallon leak of a gasoline-like liquid until they could no longer conceal it and kept quiet about a repaired pipeline to avoid responsibility . &quot; Upon discovery ( of the leak ) , I believe that Texaco knew the product was from the leak of the repaired pipeline , &quot; states Warden Holly Etheridge in the affidavit . But investigators did not discover that the broken Texaco pipeline was close to the spill until they found it eight months after Texaco ' s January , 1993 , report , according to a Fish and Game spokesman who read the affidavit to The Times . So_much of the toxic liquid leaked that a slick 25 feet thick was eventually discovered atop an underground water basin beneath the spill . Officials estimate it will take years to pump all_of the toxic liquid out of the ground and clean_up the site . Texaco officials insist that the source of the spill is unknown . Spokeswoman Faye Cox said the company has cooperated fully in trying to clean_up the site . She said Texaco is dismayed that state and local investigators raided the company ' s oil field offices Tuesday night and continued its search for incriminating documents through Thursday . &quot; We notified Fish and Game and the proper authorities immediately , &quot; Cox said . &quot; We have worked with Fish and Game throughout this whole process . that ' s why we ' re shocked by the actions taken. &quot; Meanwhile , north Ventura residents who live along School Canyon Creek said they are outraged that neither Texaco nor the state notified them about the contamination . Heavy rains last year apparently forced some of the toxic liquid to the surface where it flowed down School Canyon to the creek . Many neighborhood children play in the creek and could have been exposed to highly toxic chemicals , several mothers said . &quot; A year later we find_out , &quot; June Teran said . &quot; A whole year after the kids have been back there . It isn ' t fair. &quot; * Cox said Texaco would have notified residents if state investigators would have recommended such a move . &quot; We had no reason to believe the public was in danger , &quot; she said . State investigators say they think Texaco suspected the toxic liquid might flow a mile down the creek past the residential neighborhood . &quot; Texaco probably knew that the material would not remain in one spot , that it would travel underground down the canyon and to the open creek and eventually to the Ventura River , &quot; said Fish and Game spokesman Bob Schlicting , paraphrasing the affidavit . The basis for possible felony charges would be that Texaco knowingly discharged a toxic substance onto private_property and into state waters , since some of the leaked substance was flushed by rain into the nearby creek and the Ventura River , prosecutors said . If such charges are eventually filed and proved , Texaco could face fines of $ 50 # 000 for each day it failed to report the spill and company officials could be fined $ 10 # 000 and imprisoned for up_to three years . But prosecutors said Thursday that they have just begun to examine evidence gathered over the past year by state Fish and Game , the lead investigative agency . &quot; We ' re still in the process of collecting evidence , &quot; Assistant Dist . Atty . Colleen Toy White said . &quot; But this is a serious case . Any release of this kind of substance has the potential for very significant impacts. &quot; The spill is far larger than the Jan . 17 leak of 214 # 000 gallons of crude_oil into the Santa Clara River and a spill of 84 # 000 gallons of crude into a lake at McGrath State Beach in December . The environmental cost of the School Canyon spill is still unknown . No dead or injured wildlife have been found in the area , authorities said . But the potential for problems is high , said Reed Smith , a pollution response coordinator for Fish and Game . &quot; This stuff is really hot , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s an extremely toxic material. &quot; Two of the four components of the liquid are known or suspected of causing cancer . And both benzene and toluene also cause nervous_system disorders . Ethyl benzene is a nervous_system depressant and xylene may produce breathing problems . State investigators said they do not know how much of the 370 # 000 gallons of lightweight , colorless natural_gas condensate -- which is refined into gasoline and propane -- leaked into School Canyon Creek , nor what its effect has been downstream . They said they think that much of the liquid may still be contained within a small area , in soil saturated to a depth of 50 feet and floating in an underground water basin below . The toxic liquid apparently remained in the spill area until last year ' s rains elevated the water_table , pushing some of the liquid to the surface and down the canyon , Smith of Fish and Game said . But he said there is no evidence the liquid has migrated underground far enough to be detected in test wells drilled down the_hill from the site . * The sandy soil in the area could allow relatively rapid subterranean movement of up_to one foot a day , county hydrologists said . Nor are there any known drinking_water wells nearby that could have been contaminated by the spill , local water officials said . Nearly all north Ventura residents receive city water and none of it is drawn from the oil field area , said Ventura water production supervisor Mike Oakley . &quot; There ' s a possibility that some of the farmers in that area may have some wells , but I don ' t think they ' re used for potable water . I think they ' re used for irrigation. &quot; Nearby residents , however , said they they are nervous about the effects of the spill and angry they had not been told about it earlier . &quot; I think when something happens in your back yard , they should let you know , &quot; said Helen Loucado , 44 , whose home backs_up to School Canyon Creek . &quot; You know how kids are . They like to get their hands in the dirt and stomp around. &quot; Residents said more_than a dozen young_birds have been found dead in recent months near the creek . And one resident said the spill has raised questions about recurring headaches and stomachaches her children have experienced . &quot; In one quarter last year , my daughter had to miss 22 days of school , &quot; said Sarah Murillo , 29 . &quot; It makes you wonder. &quot; Beyond health considerations , investigators are weighing the legal implications of Texaco ' s response to the spill . Fish and Game ' s sworn affidavit lays_out a series of events that allegedly show Texaco concealed information about the leak , Schlicting said . The affidavit states that Texaco first notified Fish and Game_Warden Etheridge about a small leak on Jan . 25 , 1993 , though the state Office of Emergency Services said it received a call from Texaco on Jan . 12 . The OES is a clearinghouse where reports of toxic spills are disseminated to appropriate agencies . Frank MacCioli , the regulatory compliance officer for Texaco , told Etheridge that the spill was detected on Jan . 12 after heavy rains brought the toxic liquid to the surface . MacCioli said Texaco pressure-tested all its lines and found no leaks . MacCioli said the most likely source was abandoned lines or lines operated by Shell Oil or owned by Southern California Gas . On March 4 , both Texaco and Shell Oil agreed to have their natural_gas condensate sampled and &quot; fingerprinted &quot; to determine whose plant was the source of the spill . But after Texaco failed to submit a sample promptly , the warden drew her own sample . On May 25 , Fish and Game tests confirmed that the spill came from Texaco , and a month later notified the company , according to the affidavit . In August , a Texaco consulting firm discovered four small pipelines running_across School Canyon near the spill site , where extensive contamination had been confirmed in the spring . The soil beneath the lines was wet with the toxic liquid . * After finding that one of the pipelines had been repaired , state investigators were told by a Texaco field supervisor that the lines were not used under pressure and only carried gas vapors away from a natural_gas plant . Under further questioning , the supervisor acknowledged that the pipelines had carried pressurized condensate until February , 1993 , the month after Texaco reported the spill . &quot; Texaco denied previous knowledge of a spill or seep throughout the yearlong investigation . . . &quot; said Schlicting , reading from the affidavit . &quot; Texaco denied knowledge of repairs or records of repairs_to that pipeline. &quot; Texaco ' s Cox said questions about the affidavit had been referred to the company ' s attorneys , who she said refused comment to reporters .

Volatile Compounds Found Gas condensate is a liquid byproduct from the processing of natural_gas . The liquid smells and looks much like gasoline . Further processing converts the gas condensate to propane and gasoline . Four volatile compounds were discovered in the samples taken at the spill site . Benzene : Found in gasoline , it is a known human carcinogen and highly toxic . Exposure may result in fatigue , anorexia and other central_nervous_system disorders . Ethylbenzene : A depressant to the central_nervous_system and a skin hazard . Toluene : Found in gasoline , it is a central_nervous_system depressant and skin hazard . Chronic exposure can result in anemia or leukemia . Xylene : It is toxic , ignitable and may produce pulmonary edema . Oil Spill Site At least 370 # 000 gallons-or 8 # 800 barrels-of a petroleum byproduct spilled , state officials said , when a pipeline ruptured at a Texaco production plant in north Ventura . Cleanup of the underground spill could take three years .</TEXT>
