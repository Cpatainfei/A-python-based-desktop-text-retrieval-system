   <TEXT> As waves of aftershocks continued to jolt quake-ravaged Southern California , life was anything but back to normal Tuesday for vast swaths of the region , which was struggling to dig_out from the rubble , maneuver over a crumpled freeway system and assess the devastation without full benefit of power , gas or phones . A day after a magnitude 6.6 earthquake rumbled violently under the San Fernando Valley , tens of thousands of frazzled and displaced residents turned their neighborhoods into sprawling campgrounds , burning tree limbs for warmth , boiling water against contaminants , stocking up_on batteries and wondering when -- or if -- they will be able to return home . &quot; At least if I die here , they ' ll find me quick and not have to search for me in the rubble , &quot; said Silvia Martinez , 25 , who was camped_out at Echo Park Lake , where she had set_up a frayed mattress under a makeshift tent of black garbage bags strung between two shopping_carts . The day ' s major developments : * The death toll climbed to 40 . Among the latest fatalities was the 16th body to be pulled from the three-story Northridge Meadows apartments , which became the focus of a grim rescue mission after it collapsed into two floors . Four other deaths in the latest tally were attributed to heart_attacks . One other died in a traffic accident on Monday . * Medical officials said that 530 people had suffered injuries serious enough to be hospitalized , while another 2 # 333 injured were treated and released . Hospitals remained swamped across the Valley , doctors performed triage in parking_lots and kidney patients scrambled to find dialysis treatment . * Unable or unwilling to venture back to their homes , as_many as 20 # 000 people had set_up camp in at least 70 city parks . Thousands more were holed_up at emergency shelters or were checked_into hotels . * As top federal_officials met to discuss how best to bring emergency aid to the region , President Clinton announced he would visit Los Angeles today . Insurance industry officials estimated that insured damage from the quake and aftershocks will exceed $ 1 billion . * With scores of employees staying_away_from work , traffic on the region ' s fractured roadways was remarkably light . Already , demolition crews were busy tearing_down crumbled and debris-strewn stretches of the Santa Monica and Golden State freeways . * Nearly 82 # 000 customers were still without power , at least 50 # 000 had no water and 28 # 000 were without natural_gas . Although telephone_service was largely restored , officials said lines remained congested and urged residents to limit their calls . * Mayor Richard Riordan extended the curfew through Tuesday night , saying the continuing need for one would be evaluated each day . He did , however , change its start from dusk to 11 p.m. Los Angeles police , meanwhile , reported minimal looting and curfew violations . If fact , Monday night was so quiet that only 73 people were arrested in the entire city , a fraction of the average tally . * While some comfort could be taken_in Tuesday ' s blue_skies and warm winter sun , forecasters predicted rain by the weekend , hastening efforts to board_up and repair damaged structures . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s hit everyone here yet , &quot; said Connie Buchanan , 65 , whose one-bedroom apartment in Sherman Oaks was squashed to about half its original height . All along her block on Murieta Avenue , an almost festival atmosphere prevailed as residents evacuated buildings , filling the sidewalks with furniture , clothes and paintings . &quot; We ' re all sort of going_around not knowing what to feel , &quot; she said . Do You Cry ? On the Day After , disaster maintained its persistent grip . While many survivors were able to reflect on the good_fortune that Monday ' s earthquake had struck so early in the morning , the full extent of its deadly punch grew increasingly clear . At the Northridge Meadows apartments , where nearly half of the quake ' s dead had been unearthed from the submerged first_floor , search dogs discovered a 16th body surrounded by pots and pans , wedged under heavy pillars in a three-foot void . Officials did not immediately identify the victim , but it was believed to be Pil Sook Lee , a 47-year-old mechanic who had been preparing to go_to work when the quake struck . Lee ' s wife , Hyun , a nurse , managed to crawl from the rubble with a 12-year-old son . But within hours of the quake , she learned that her 14-year-old son had been killed and her husband was presumed dead . After 24 hours of desperate searching that riveted TV viewers nationwide , Los Angeles Fire_Department Battalion Chief Bill Burmester said he was confident that no one -- alive or dead -- was left in the 160-unit structure that has become an emblem of the quake ' s deadly muscle . During the final sweep , rescue teams used high-tech listening devices and a tiny fiber-optic camera that was lowered into narrow crevices . Mayor Richard Riordan , in his first ground tour of the earthquake damage , crossed police lines and walked so close to the damaged Northridge complex that authorities warned him to stay back . &quot; It ' s just scary how quickly life can be put_out , &quot; he said after he stared at the rubble . At one point on Riordan ' s tour , a sobbing woman threw her arms around him and virtually pulled him into her Granada Hills home . Water had ruined her living room , mud was caked on her rug and a plastic tarp covered what was left of her possessions . &quot; I don ' t know what to do , &quot; she cried . Art Ginsburg , whose motto is &quot; Every Sandwich Is a Work_of_Art , &quot; knew exactly what to do . A fire , apparently the result of a quake-related gas leak , ripped through his namesake deli in Studio City early Tuesday morning , caving_in the roof and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage . But after 37 years serving_up roast_beef , pastrami and Swiss_cheese sandwiches , Ginsburg was not about to throw_in_the_towel . &quot; I was_sick when they called me , &quot; he said . &quot; I cried . I think we all cried . But the sign has been up there since 1957 , it ' s still up there and it ' s going_to stay_up there. &quot; In Santa Monica , where some residents expressed concern that a barrage of reports from the Valley had overshadowed severe damage of_their_own , 83 buildings were deemed unsafe for occupancy and access to 111 other structures was restricted . Officials said hundreds of gas leaks had been detected in the city and one house exploded during Monday ' s quake . On Tuesday , broken glass and dislodged bricks kept businesses along Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards shuttered . The popular Third Street Promenade pedestrian mall was bandaged in plywood . At the landmark Santa Monica pier , cars were banned as inspectors tried to assess foundation damage . Sandra Campos showed_up with her husband and four daughters at a Red_Cross shelter at Santa Monica Community_College after their eight-story oceanfront apartment complex was evacuated . &quot; I want to find_out -- is there someone I can talk to about finding a place to live ? &quot; Campos asked . &quot; My daughters want to go_home . I tell them , ' What home do we have to go_to ? ' &quot; Piero Selvaggio was feeling particularly battered . Just 2 1 / 2 months ago , the 47-year-old restaurateur lost his hillside home_in Malibu to wind-whipped wildfires . On Tuesday , his voice grew tight as he described the damage to his prized wine collection at Valentino in Santa Monica . &quot; In my wildest dream , in my worst scenario , I always felt if anything like this would happen there would be a river of wine running from my restaurant to the beach , &quot; he said . &quot; When I drove_in , the red_river that I had thought in my dreams many times was reality . The wine was flowing through my driveway , across the parking_lot , on the way down to Pico Boulevard. &quot; Selvaggio estimated that about 30 # 000 bottles were destroyed in his 100 # 000-bottle cellar -- the largest wine list , he says , on the West Coast . After sorting through the shattered glass , looking_for fragments of labels and corks , he calculated the loss at about $ 250 # 000 . But he said many of the vintages , which he had collected over the last two decades from old vineyards in France and Italy , do not exist any more . &quot; What do you do ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Do you continue to cry ? Do you continue to scream and say , ' Why me ? ' &quot; In Ventura County , damage estimates rose to at least $ 400 million and injury totals climbed to 800 Tuesday as officials said they expected to soon join the San Fernando Valley as a federal disaster_area . At least half the damage was reported in the historic railroad town of Fillmore , where dozens of_aging masonry shops collapsed and between 600 and 1 # 000 houses were damaged , officials estimated . Building inspectors indefinitely closed the 40-unit Arundell Circle apartment complex and a two-story residential hotel that was home to more_than 100 field laborers . &quot; We didn ' t get anything -- not even shoes , &quot; said Pedro Barajas , 53 , who was left homeless with his eight children after their apartment at the Fillmore Hotel was damaged . But it was in the newer eastern Ventura County communities of Simi Valley , Thousand Oaks and Moorpark that the estimates of devastation rose most sharply . The Moorpark College library and gymnasium suffered so_much damage that officials said they may never be repaired . Thousand Oaks ' large new library lost part of its roof . The Simi Valley courthouse and City_Hall both had major water damage . Structural damage at Simi Valley High_School was so severe that officials said they could not guess when students might return . And parts of Simi Valley ' s famed Bottle Village , a one-acre enclave made of glass bottles , came crashing down . Like Gold Much of Tuesday was devoted to the gritty task of survival , as residents hit hardest by Monday ' s disaster struggled to adapt , improvise and overcome . The quake left many without the barest necessities : 82 # 000 homes and businesses were without electricity , 50 # 000 were without water , another 50 # 000 had only intermittent water and 28 # 000 were without natural_gas . A freshly conscripted army of homeless -- often dazed , ill-clothed and barely able to find words to describe their plight -- sought safety in city parks and parking_lots and unused patches of urban greenery . Tents , lean-tos and family vehicles were used for shelter ; meals were cooked over portable barbecue pits and makeshift ovens . Many of the 20 # 000 who slept under Monday ' s starry skies had fled their unsafe homes after ceilings collapsed and buckled walls sent possessions flying willy-nilly . But some chose the outdoors simply because it seemed less confined in a world that was caving_in . &quot; I was afraid to be here , &quot; conceded Gladys Contreras , 32 , who was camping beside the Echo Park Lake with her three children , ages 2 to 16 . &quot; But it was preferable to dying in my apartment. &quot; For many of the new homeless , however , the seismic threat was soon replaced by by the prospect of urban danger . Worried about confrontations with the hard-core homeless or other nighttime menaces , some campers tried to find spots near police_stations or National_Guard outposts ; others made their own security arrangements . Olga Gonzalez , who slept_in a tent near the Los Feliz Boulevard entrance to Griffith Park , said her husband and another man stayed_up all night to protect the children in their band of a dozen families . At about 3 a.m. , she said , two coyotes came within 30 feet of their tent , but the men prepared to do battle with sticks . Later , a homeless woman with a dog trundled by and cursed at her new neighbors . &quot; we ' ll stay 72 hours , &quot; said Gonzalez , 29 . &quot; They say that ' s when the earth should stay still. &quot; The steady rocking of aftershocks sent many other anxious residents out_in search of the bare essentials , triggering long lines at automated bank teller machines , gas_pumps and hardware_stores , where the repentant hastily stocked up_on survival supplies . At Granada Hills High_School , people lined_up for hours to get five-gallon jugs of water , courtesy of the city Department of Water and Power . One woman , criticized for going directly to the front of the line , yelled back : &quot; My husband has had open heart_surgery ! &quot; Dozens of others formed a long line at a Northridge hardware_store , many of them seeking one particularly hot item -- an 18-inch piece of flexible copper tubing used for hot water_heaters . &quot; I called around to 10 or 12 stores , and there ' s probably only about four plumbing stores open in the whole Valley , and most of them are totally sold_out of them , &quot; said 46-year-old Don Wyatt of Chatsworth , who stood near the head of the line . &quot; Today , these things are like gold. &quot; Diapers were also worth more_than their weight . &quot; All day yesterday , I had to use napkins because none of the stores were open , &quot; said Maria Cisneros , a 25-year-old Northridge resident who had spent two hours cradling her 2-year-old daughter outside a supermarket in North Hills . &quot; Napkins don ' t work so well. &quot; &quot; Yes , I know , &quot; said Peggy Brister , who stood several places away in_line with a baby of_her_own . &quot; I ' m down to tissues. &quot; With supply low and demand high , reports of price-gouging began to surface . The son of Rose Castenada , an aide to Rep . Howard Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , went_out Tuesday to buy one of those copper tubes for the family ' s water_heater . He was told the item , which usually goes_for less than $ 10 , was being sold for $ 30 . When he asked why the store was charging so_much , a merchant replied : &quot; Earthquake prices. &quot; Police_Chief Willie L . Williams called_for residents who encounter such practices to contact officers immediately . But if there was meanness and profiteering , there was also charity and goodwill . Lynnette Hargraves , 46 , and her cousin , Jackie Johnson , 42 , were frantically calling relatives on the East Coast from a pay phone after their apartment_building on Reseda Boulevard was leveled . &quot; We don ' t have nothing . We lost everything . We need money , &quot; said the pajama-clad Hargraves , pleading for her relatives to send money by Western Union . &quot; We need water , &quot; Johnson said to a passerby . &quot; We ' re staying in a park . We don ' t want to do that , but at least it ' s near a police station. &quot; As she walked by , Patricia Story heard the two strangers crying . Without a moment ' s hesitation , she handed them $ 25 and a slip_of_paper with her phone_number . &quot; If you need a place to stay , I have a three-bedroom house , &quot; she said soothingly . ' Bust Our Butts ' Even as officials continued to take_stock of the damage wrought by Monday ' s earthquake , the rebuilding efforts began throughout Southern California , hurried in part by the forecast of rain by Saturday . Reconstruction of the junction of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways was Caltrans ' top priority because of its role as a commercial umbilical_cord linking Northern and Southern California , said Dean Dunphy , state secretary of Business , Transportation and Housing . &quot; We ' re going to bust our butts to get this done as fast as possible , &quot; Dunphy said . Cleanup crews will work around the clock to clear the rubble -- an exercise that should take at least a week , Dunphy said . Meanwhile , a nearby road will be resurfaced to provide a detour during the construction . To expedite the freeway repairs , Caltrans is short-circuiting the bidding process and expediting construction permits so contracts can be awarded within weeks instead of months , said Caltrans chief bridge engineer Jim Roberts . Further greasing the skids , U.S. Transportation_Secretary Federico F . Pena -- dispatched to Los Angeles by President Clinton in_advance of_his_own visit here today -- said four contracts , totaling $ 3.4 million , were immediately awarded to help clear freeway debris . &quot; Anywhere along the line where we can cut red_tape , we will do that , &quot; said Pena after touring damaged areas . Caltrans also announced it would ask an independent panel of engineering experts to review the state ' s program of retrofitting highway bridges to resist earthquake damage . The panel was established after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake collapsed a double-decked section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland and damaged part of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge . &quot; What we are trying to do is get the very best science , get_the_best structural engineers to review our work so we are not sitting here thinking we know everything , &quot; said Caltrans Director Jim Van Loben Sels . Already , work crews were out before dawn taking_aim at the crumbled stretch of Santa Monica Freeway , where a 200-foot concrete bridge collapsed onto La Cienega Boulevard . In a task that seemed as daunting as breaking_apart an iceberg with an ice_pick , workers used two hydraulic hammers , mounted on large trucks , to begin chipping_away_at the concrete . The scene attracted hundreds of spectators -- and catering trucks to feed them . Although the region ' s celebrated freeway system lay_in shambles , there was good news for subterranean commuters . After a one-day closure , the Red_Line subway reopened Tuesday with reduced service and officials said the tunnels sustained no visible earthquake damage . As aftershocks from the quake ' s destructive punch continued to ripple across Southern California , the cleanup campaign also was being waged on an environmental front . Near Newhall , crews scrambled Tuesday to contain a 15-mile-long slick of crude_oil that spilled into the Santa Clara River after a nearby Arco pipeline ruptured . Booms were put into the river to stop further flow toward the ocean , while workers attempted to remove the oil from the water surface with vacuums and pads . Still , more_than 1 # 000 barrels of oil had spread from Santa Clarita to Piru , triggering concern about the impact on the river and its wildlife , including two federally endangered species -- a fish known as the unarmored three-spined_stickleback , and a bird , the least Bell ' s vireo . To the south , Anaheim city officials -- hoping for state and federal disaster aid -- mapped plans to repair Anaheim Stadium , where the 35 # 000-pound message board and instant-replay screen crashed down and the landmark &quot; Big A &quot; atop the stadium was bent backward at a 45-degree angle . &quot; We ' ve had significant damage -- several million dollars damage , &quot; said city spokesman Bret Colson . &quot; Obviously , it ' s dwarfed by what ' s happened in Los Angeles County , but we ' ve taken a pretty big hit too. &quot; Preliminary estimates on the cost of the earthquake ' s damage varied greatly . Richard Krimm , associate director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , said it would exceed the $ 1.1 billion remaining in FEMA ' s disaster fund , already depleted by last summer ' s Midwest floods and last fall ' s wildfires here . The federal_government was the target of widespread criticism for slow and inadequate response to disasters before Clinton ' s watch -- most notably Hurricane Andrew -- and the President clearly wants to send a strong signal that his Administration is compassionate and efficient when it comes_to providing emergency aid . Even as bureaucracies sprung into action , individual response efforts emerged on various fronts -- sometimes in frustration . Moz Dhanani , reservations manager for El Monte RV Center , said he offered to FEMA about 25 motor_homes for use during the week , but the agency has expressed no interest in his offer . He complained that despite having left numerous messages , officials had not returned his calls . The motor_homes are heated , can accommodate six and have cooking facilities . &quot; We see small children sleeping_in parking_lots . . . yet we have all these motor_homes just sitting around , &quot; Dhanani said Tuesday . &quot; We feel very frustrated. &quot; Local charities said that , with Tuesday ' s improved telephone_service , offers of help have begun to stream in from individuals and small groups . &quot; The shock is beginning to wear_off and now we ' re getting a tremendous number of calls from people who want to help , &quot; said Susan Weight , spokeswoman for Catholic Charities , the social_service arm of the Los Angeles Roman_Catholic Archdiocese . &quot; We ' re asking for non-perishable food items , paper diapers , baby formula , new blankets and especially cash . Cash is absolutely what we need the most , because it can be converted into whatever is needed , &quot; she said . Despite the early promise of public outpouring , Weight admitted concern for meeting everyone ' s needs , given the enormity of the disaster . &quot; I ' m a little concerned , because this is the largest disaster to ever hit Los Angeles , in terms of the number of people needing help , &quot; she said . &quot; This is going_to take all_of us , everyone , coming together. &quot;</TEXT>
