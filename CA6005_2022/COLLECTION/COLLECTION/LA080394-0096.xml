   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; POLITICALLY SOFTER APPROACH ENTERS HEALTH CARE PAGEANT ; LEGISLATION : SENATE LEADER ' S PLAN EASES COST CONTROLS AND EMPLOYER MANDATES . THAT COULD WOO SUPPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The health_care reform plan that Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) unveiled Tuesday offers his fellow Democrats a tempting escape_from immediate political peril -- a way to take a giant step back from the thicket of government price_controls and federal mandates that provoked so_much of the criticism and concern over President Clinton ' s original proposals . But Mitchell ' s politically attractive approach comes at a potential price for American consumers , the business_community and the nation ' s health_care system : He has abandoned many of the tough , government-enforced cost control measures that are central to the Democratic alternative under_consideration in the House . In their place , Mitchell would rely_on watered-down cost containment measures and -- probably more important -- on a continuation of recent trends toward slower growth in the rise of health costs nationwide . Unlike the Clinton plan , or the similar blueprint put_forward by House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) last week , Mitchell ' s approach offers a strong vote_of_confidence that the free market can ultimately extend high-quality , affordable medical coverage to nearly all Americans -- with only occasional nudges from Washington . If , however , Mitchell ' s gamble on the free market should come_up short , consumers could see costs and taxes begin to climb or the quality and freedom of choice of their health_care begin to erode -- or all_of the above . Gone from Mitchell ' s Senate proposal are such features as drug price_controls , strict caps on health_insurance premiums and provisions for the mandatory use of government-sponsored insurance buying cooperatives . While critics have challenged the government-mandated cost control provisions of the House proposal , the absence of comparable features in Mitchell ' s plan raises questions about his ability to finance a sharp expansion of health coverage . Those doubts are heightened by the fact that Mitchell ' s plan envisions the creation of a rich package of health benefits similar to the best corporate plans now on the market . Mitchell ' s goal is coverage for 95 % of Americans , somewhat short of Clinton ' s call_for &quot; universal &quot; coverage . But the senator provided few hard-cost estimates for the major provisions of his proposal , and the Congressional Budget Office has not yet completed its official analysis of the plan . One concrete feature for financing Mitchell ' s plan is a 25 % &quot; assessment &quot; on so-called &quot; high-cost &quot; health_care plans , that is , plans whose costs for basic services exceed still-to-be-established federal guidelines . It is unclear exactly how such a penalty would be imposed in practice , but it almost certainly could mean a direct or indirect cost increase for millions of Americans whose employers are paying substantially above average_costs under their existing insurance programs . This is especially true in regions where the trend toward health_maintenance_organizations and managed care are much less advanced than in California . Such increases could come as a shock to many middle-class Americans who now enjoy health_care coverage that they consider normal , not luxurious -- including wide freedom to choose doctors under the traditional fee-for-service system . Even so , the ability of such an assessment to control costs significantly remains unproved . As the battle over health_care reform comes_down to the wire , the Clinton proposal has been left for dead politically . Both Congress and the White_House will focus their efforts in the weeks ahead on the Mitchell and Gephardt proposals . Reform , if it comes this year , will be some combination of those two approaches . Above all , Mitchell ' s plan differs from both the Clinton and Gephardt proposals on employer mandates , the issue that has become the key dividing_line in this year ' s health_care debate . Rather than establishing mandates right away , Mitchell ' s plan would call_for relatively small mandates only to be triggered under certain circumstances -- and perhaps only in certain states -- after the turn_of_the_century . Failure to achieve a 95 % coverage rate by the turn_of_the_century would trigger automatic employer mandates in states with low coverage rates under Mitchell ' s plan , something a future Congress could overturn . Under his proposal , the mandates would require companies and employees to each pay 50 % of the costs of insurance_premiums , compared with an 80 % employer contribution under the Gephardt formula . Moreover , if federal costs of providing subsidies for the working poor and others exceed set guidelines , then Congress will be forced to reduce the subsidies . Yet without sufficient subsidies , health_care insurance would remain unaffordable for a larger percentage of Americans , triggering the mandates . Mitchell stresses that he is confident that despite such questions , his plan will prod the free market to gradually increase the rate of insurance coverage , thus avoiding his mandate triggers . &quot; My bill . . . lays the groundwork for universal coverage through a voluntary system , &quot; he said in asking his colleagues to act in the coming weeks . The plan clearly draws heavily on the compromise crafted by the Senate Finance_Committee , which the CBO criticized for pushing off too_much responsibility to the states for managing and supervising a new health_care system . The CBO argues that the states are ill-equipped to take a leading role in the overhaul of an industry that accounts_for one-seventh of the American economy . Mitchell said Tuesday that he expects the CBO to offer the same criticism of his plan as well . Still , Mitchell ' s efforts to find a pro-market , middle way in the health_care policy debate drew praise from Senate moderates Tuesday . &quot; George Mitchell has taken a major step_forward on health_care legislation based on market reforms rather than relying_on bureaucratic mandates and regulations , &quot; said Sen . John B . Breaux ( D-La. ) . Mitchell ' s bill even attracted relatively sympathetic comments from business groups that have been dead-set against both Clinton ' s plan and the House version of health_care reform . The National Assn . of Manufacturers , for instance , complained that it had some qualms about Mitchell ' s plan but said that &quot; it improves upon the House leadership ' s package &quot; and noted that it should not create broad new government activities requiring mandatory federal spending . &quot; The most important distinction between the two bills is that the Senate plan wisely stays_away_from creating a new entitlement program , &quot; said NAM President Jerry Jasinowski . In fact , the House leadership proposal creates a major expansion of the Medicare system to provide a source of insurance coverage for millions of workers at small companies and for the unemployed . The Senate plan , by contrast , assumes that market reforms can be relied_upon to make_it so attractive to employers that they will voluntarily buy insurance for their workers over the next six years . Both proposals , meanwhile , provide subsidies for the working poor and small firms with low-wage employees . Mitchell hopes to pay_for his plan , including the subsidies , with savings from Medicare , the federal health plan now available for those over 65 and the disabled , and the elimination of Medicaid , the federal health program for the poor . In addition , Mitchell has sought to avoid yet another major flap over cigarette taxes by accepting a 45 cent-per pack tax that has already passed the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee and which is included in Gephardt ' s proposal as well .</TEXT>
