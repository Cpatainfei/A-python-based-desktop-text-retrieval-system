   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA ' S ELECTIONS ; PROP . 187 ; IS IT ' SAVE OUR STATE ' OR ' SINK OUR STATE ' ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> WHAT IT IS Sponsors have labeled Proposition 187 the &quot; save our state &quot; initiative . Opponents counter that it is more likely to sink our state . Both sides do , however , agree on one thing : The sweeping ballot measure elicits passions of all types on a scale unheard of since the days of Howard Jarvis and Proposition 13 . As with the seminal -- and controversial -- tax-cutting measure of the late 1970s , Proposition 187 could have a burgeoning series of economic and emotional impacts that will become fully clear only as time passes . If enacted and upheld by the courts , Proposition 187 would bar illegal immigrant youngsters from attending public_schools , colleges or universities and would eliminate any child welfare or foster care benefits for undocumented youngsters . Illegal immigrants of all ages would be barred from receiving any of the limited publicly funded non-emergency health_care programs they now qualify for -- including immunizations against deadly disease and prenatal care . In addition , Proposition 187 requires state and local police agencies to report to federal authorities anyone they arrest who is suspected of being an illegal immigrant . And it provides stiff new state sanctions for the manufacture or use of false immigration documents , already illegal under federal law . To accomplish these goals , public health , social_service , law_enforcement and educational administrators would be required to verify the citizenship status of their clients , arrestees and pupils . Parents of all children in public_schools also would have to provide proof of their legal_status . The administrators would be required to turn_in the names of those suspected of illegal status to the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service and the state_attorney general ' s office . With an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants in California and a weak economy , the pre-election debate has turned less on whether illegal immigration is a problem than on whether Proposition 187 is a good solution . The initiative does not directly address several key issues involving illegal immigration -- including how to strengthen border enforcement or how to prevent businesses from employing illegal immigrants . If it passes , various provisions of the measure are likely to be challenged in court , particularly the ban on illegal immigrants attending public_schools . The measure is a statutory amendment . If approved , it may be amended by the Legislature but only to further the measure ' s goals . Such changes would require a two-thirds vote_in each house of the Legislature or a majority vote by state voters . ARGUMENTS FOR Proponents say Proposition 187 would send a clear message to federal_officials that Californians are tired_of illegal immigration . It would also make a statement that those who break the law should not be rewarded in any way for their actions . By cutting_off services to those who are in California illegally , backers say , the state could reduce costs for social_services , health_care and education by more_than $ 3 billion a year if all portions of the measure are upheld by the courts . The savings could be used to increase the quality of education and provide additional health_care and social_services for legal residents . Proponents say those who are denied these basic services might return to their native_lands or be discouraged from entering California in the first place . The ban on public_school enrollment could lead the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit a 1982 decision and , backers say , eventually reverse its ruling that declared it unconstitutional to deny a free public education to undocumented school-age children . ARGUMENTS AGAINST Opponents say Proposition 187 is mean-spirited and poorly drafted and will do nothing to stop the flow of illegal immigrants across the state ' s borders . The measure , they say , flies in the face of the U.S. Constitution and provides an open invitation for a flurry of costly and time-consuming lawsuits . It turns educators and doctors into quasi-immigration agents and places at risk about $ 15 billion in federal funding for state and local education , health and welfare programs because of conflicts with federal confidentiality requirements . The crime_rate could increase , opponents say , if hundreds of thousands of kindergarten through 12th-grade students are ejected from schools . Besides , children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents , they say . Disease could spread more quickly because of the inability of illegal immigrants to receive any non-emergency health_care . Moreover , the requirement to turn_in suspected illegal immigrants could foster a police_state mentality , in which citizens and other legal residents would be harassed simply because of the color of their skin , their accents or their last_names , opponents say . WHO SUPPORTS IT Former INS administrators Harold Ezell and Alan C . Nelson and Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) are credited with co-authoring the initiative . Other supporters are Gov . Pete Wilson , Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington , former GOP presidential candidate Patrick J . Buchanan , the California Republican_Party , California Coalition for Immigration Reform and the San Fernando Valley ' s 21 chambers_of_commerce . The Save Our State Committee , which led the campaign to qualify the measure for the ballot , is chaired by Mountjoy , Ronald Prince and Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley . WHO OPPOSES IT The California Teachers Assn. , California Medical Assn. , California Labor Federation , state Parent-Teacher Assn. , state School_Boards Assn. , Peace_Officers Research Assn . of California , state League of Women Voters , Congress of California Seniors , California State Employees Assn. , Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , California ' s Catholic bishops , American Jewish Congress , Los Angeles City_Council , Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors , President Bill_Clinton , U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein , Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown , Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block , former Republican Cabinet secretaries Jack F . Kemp and William J .
