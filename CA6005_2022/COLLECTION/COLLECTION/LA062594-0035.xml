   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL FIGHT MOUNTS OVER ANTI-CRIME BILL ; CONGRESS : GOP ' S UNHAPPINESS WITH A ' RACIAL JUSTICE ' PROVISION THREATENS THE LEGISLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it cleared the Senate and the House by overwhelming margins , this year ' s anti-crime bill looked_like a proposal whose time had come . It offered a President hungry for domestic accomplishments a way of spawning innovative projects in cities large and small . And it offered lawmakers with violence-plagued constituents an opportunity to demonstrate determination to crack_down on crime . But somewhere on the way to its gala signing ceremony , the most-likely-to-succeed package is in danger of disappearing in deep political quicksand . The widespread agreement on many of its aspects is now being overshadowed by a bitter fight over one provision that relates to racial disparity between convicted murderers who receive the death_penalty and those who do not . The so-called &quot; racial justice &quot; provision , which was passed only by the House , has become such an explosive issue that it threatens to trigger a Senate filibuster and jeopardize passage of the legislation . An increasingly anxious White_House and Democratic leaders in Congress are struggling to find a route through a minefield of racial politics to passage of the measure , but so far they have been stumped . &quot; I think we are in a real box , &quot; said one House Democratic leader . The debate , which is being waged as House and Senate negotiators try to find a compromise anti-crime bill acceptable to each chamber , says as much as anything about the very different ways that various coalitions in Congress react to the crime issue as well as the limits on the White_House ' s ability to cope_with it . The racial justice provision , sponsored by Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) , a longtime civil_rights advocate , would allow defendants convicted of capital crimes to challenge their death sentences by producing statistical evidence to prove that the penalty was being applied in a discriminatory manner in their area of the country . The judge who presided over a challenged conviction then would be empowered to change the sentence to life imprisonment . Driving the debate is a belief that in some regions , the death_penalty is applied more often in cases where blacks murder whites than in cases of blacks murdering blacks or whites murdering whites . The issue is by no means clear , however , with advocates and opponents alike marshaling statistics that they contend either prove or disprove that such bias exists . The provision barely passed the House on a 217-212 vote and was not included in the Senate bill . &quot; It will identify in certain jurisdictions those crimes for which blacks frequently get the death_penalty while white defendants rarely do , &quot; Edwards said in a recent letter to colleagues . &quot; Only a defendant who can show that his case fits such a pattern of racial disparity can invoke the act. &quot; In any case , Edwards said , prosecutors would have a chance to rebut claims of racial bias , with the decision made by a judge based on a preponderance of the evidence . Opponents , however , view the measure as an indirect attack on the death_penalty rather than as a procedure to deal with alleged racial bias in capital cases . They said that the true intent of the provision is to provide defendants with another vehicle for appeal , one that is subject_to laborious statistical arguments that will further tie_up the courts and limit executions . Rep . Bill McCollum ( R-Fla. ) , who has led the fight against the measure in the House , has said its passage &quot; would mean the end of the death_penalty in most jurisdictions where it currently exists. &quot; Rep . Henry J . Hyde ( R-Ill. ) , whose views on crime issues are shared by most of his GOP colleagues , said there is no way to compare one death sentence with another , since the circumstances of each case are different . Any attempts to deal with racial bias , he said , should be limited to &quot; the four corners of the case. &quot; &quot; I don ' t see many Republican votes for the bill with the racial justice provision in it , &quot; Hyde said . The compromise proposals floated by Democrats so far have failed to make the provision more acceptable , he added . In the Senate , several Republican senators have threatened to kill the entire crime bill by filibustering if it includes the provision . Some Democrats said that delay in the Senate-House negotiations is necessary so that the 60 votes needed to end a possible filibuster can be found . Democrats hold 56 of the 100 seats in the Senate . Democrats have to watch their left flank too . If the provision is abandoned or weakened substantially in conference , the bill could run_into trouble among House liberals , especially among members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus . &quot; I don ' t think there can be a credible crime bill without the racial justice act , &quot; said Rep . Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) . &quot; I ' d love to see the White_House take a position and support it , &quot; said Rep . John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) . &quot; It ' s going_to be tough to pass a bill without it. &quot; Clinton has never endorsed the provision , keeping himself aloof from the controversy that has raged on Capitol_Hill over this part of the bill . Dropping the provision presumably would speed final approval but Clinton ' s involvement in any such strategy would offend some of his most loyal backers in the House as well as the 38 Democrats in the Black Caucus . &quot; People underestimate what it will take_to pass this bill , &quot; said Rep . Vic Fazio ( D-West Sacramento ) , vice_chairman of the Democratic Caucus . &quot; We can ' t rush to judgment ( on the crime bill ) even though we ' d like to do_it quickly. &quot; On other issues , the key Senate and House negotiators appear close to agreement on these provisions : * $ 10.9 billion for state and local law_enforcement over the next six years , including almost $ 9 billion to hire 100 # 000 police_officers . * $ 8.4 billion for state and local prisons . * $ 7.6 billion for a variety of crime prevention programs , with an additional $ 1.4 billion for drug courts to encourage treatment of addicts rather than incarceration .
