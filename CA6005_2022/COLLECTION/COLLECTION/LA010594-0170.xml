   <HEADLINE> SCOUT FINED FOR USING CB IN BOAT RESCUE ; RULES : LAGUNA HILLS HOMEOWNERS ' GROUP IS MIFFED OVER BANNED RADIO , EVEN IF 6 PEOPLE WERE SAVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Explorer Scout who helped save six people aboard a boat stranded off Dana Point is now in icy water with his homeowners ' association , which purportedly wants to fine him for the way he did_it -- using his citizens band radio . On the night of Dec . 28 , Richard Wright and two other CB operators responded to a distress call from an 18-foot pleasure_boat . Through questions and communication relays , they guided a Coast Guard helicopter and Orange County sheriff ' s patrol_boats to the stricken vessel five miles offshore . Wright ' s good deed had a very short afterglow . &quot; The president of the ( homeowners ' ) association called our manager and he notified my mom that they want to fine me $ 150 for using my CB radio inside the association grounds , &quot; Wright , a 20-year-old member of Explorers Post 540 , said Tuesday . Sure enough , Ron Meixell , president of the 124-member Moulton Parkway Assn . No . 1 , confirmed that the association ' s board will decide at its meeting next week whether to fine Wright . According to Meixell , the youth had promised three months ago to stop using his CB radio after several condo owners complained that it interfered with their cordless telephones and television reception . &quot; I think he and his mother are simply using this rescue thing to help them out , &quot; Meixell said Tuesday . &quot; The Coast Guard even called me up , and several newspapers . This whole_thing is a basket case. &quot; He claims Wright used the CB a week before the rescue , which resulted in the threatened fine . But Wright said he was notified of the possible fine shortly after he used the CB to assist the rescue . The Coast Guard is clearly on Wright ' s side . In a letter to the association , a ranking officer called it &quot; ludicrous to fine the boy for saving lives. &quot; &quot; If it wasn ' t for his helping us , &quot; Coast Guard Petty_Officer Randolph Reid added Tuesday , &quot; it could have ended_up in serious injury or loss of life to the boater and his family. &quot; It ' s not the first time that Wright , an aspiring firefighter , has won praise for his actions . In 1992 , he was recommended for a certificate of valor from the Orange County Fire_Department after he kicked open the door of a burning condo and searched for people possibly trapped inside . He found no people , but broke_out a window to help the family dog and pet hamsters escape . And in October , the youth and other Explorers who are part of an emergency services squad responded to the Laguna Beach fire and assisted in the staging_area for emergency vehicles . A week later , the same post volunteered to help line muddy streets in Laguna Beach with sandbags after rainfall caused damage from flooding . His latest adventure involved two other CB operators , Richard Bianchini , a Mission Viejo teen-ager , and another CB user known only as &quot; Shorty. &quot; The skipper , Jose Santana of Anaheim , was aboard the vessel with his wife , two children and two other adults without flashlights and only a_few blankets , Reid said . Through a series of questions and communication relays , the three radio operators were able to approximate the boat ' s bearings and forward the information to the Coast Guard . Wright said the youths used their familiarity with the Orange County coastline and quizzed Santana on physical landmarks he could see that night . &quot; We asked if he could see San Clemente hill , which has a big red_light up_on top , the big green_light at Dana Point Harbor and then the San Onofre power_plant , &quot; Wright said . &quot; When he said San Clemente hill was closest to him , I gave that information to the Coast Guard on my cellular_phone that I grabbed from my house. &quot; Wright said he remained in his car with an open line to the Coast Guard while relaying messages through the two CB radio operators . From time to time , the signal was weak , Wright said , and one of the three operators would lose or gain the signal during the three-hour rescue operation . &quot; We first got the May_Day about 5 o ' clock , &quot; Wright said . &quot; And , it took us about an hour to find_out where the ( boater ) was . The whole_thing ended like close to 8 at night. &quot; While they remained in communications with the stranded boat , which had engine problems , they learned the pilot already had used_up his signal flares and had only a camera with a flash attachment . The Coast Guard had instructed Wright , whose CB handle is &quot; 911 , &quot; to notify Santana that when he heard the helicopter approaching to flash the camera at least twice . &quot; The rescue copter came_on the air , &quot; Wright said , &quot; and said : ' Unit 911 , do you still have a copy on the boat ? ' And , I said , ' yeah. ' They then said , ' We now have a visual on the boat. ' &quot; Wright ' s mother , Sue Sampsell , said she believes the homeowners ' association and its president are targeting her son for previous conflicts the family has had with the group . &quot; We ' re renters , and I don ' t think they like that . I don ' t feel we should have to pay this fine . We acknowledged that my son used the CB , but this was to save some person ' s life . This is what my son was brought_up to do. &quot;</TEXT>
