   <HEADLINE> PLEASE DON ' T FEED THE EXTREMISTS ; IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND SCIENTISTS , THE MIDDLE GROUND IS WHERE BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN LIVES MATTER ; THE MONKEY WARS , BY DEBORAH BLUM ( OXFORD_UNIVERSITY PRESS : $ 25 ; 306 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While surgeons in Pittsburgh were transplanting the liver of a baboon into a man ' s body , animal activists at the hospital entrance were chanting , &quot; Animals are no spare parts. &quot; Their protest was interrupted by Robert Winters , a patient on his way to a hepatitis treatment . Hepatitis attacks and destroys the liver . Starting_up the steps , Winters shouted : &quot; I didn ' t ask_for this ! But I ' ve got_it and I ' m fighting it just like that guy ( getting a transplant ) up there ! You don ' t have a right to be standing here ! &quot; The chanting stopped as Winters went_on . &quot; Do you know what it ' s like to have liver_disease ? Do you ? &quot; The ethics of sacrificing a monkey for a human life are complex enough , but there was more . Regardless of how well that transplant might have worked_out , the patient with the baboon liver was not expected to live long . He had AIDS . So it was not just a monkey ' s life for a person with a great future , but for an incurably ill person . Once the activists learned of this situation , they returned angrier than before . What makes dilemmas like these particularly difficult is the value most people intuitively attach_to the lives of monkeys and apes , our closest animal relatives . Confronted with creatures so strikingly like us , it is not hard to imagine that they have emotions similar to ours , that they are able to suffer and feel miserable as we do . There is increasing evidence that they are intellectually closer to us than any other animal . They think and plan and solve problems with a speed that often astonishes people working with them . Add_to this the endangered status of many primates in the wild , and we have every reason to assign greater weight to their lives than to that of more common laboratory animals , such_as rats or mice . Unfortunately for the primates involved , their similarity to us also carries weight from a medical perspective : It makes them uniquely valuable for transplants and research . They are often the only animals susceptible to diseases that affect us . If it were not for the testing of the polio vaccine on hundreds of thousands of monkeys in the 1950s and 1960s , science might never have halted this crippling disease . The now widely used vaccine against hepatitis_B was developed largely on chimpanzees . And most scientists believe that there will be no vaccine against AIDS without primate research . On the one hand , then , we are dealing with magnificent , intelligent animals that clearly deserve our respect and concern . On the other hand , they may hold the key to medical mysteries the resolution of which could save millions of human lives . With stakes so high , small wonder that the use of monkeys and apes in biomedical research has become one of the hottest controversies of today . In &quot; The Monkey Wars , &quot; Deborah Blum provides a candid look_at the issues from both sides . No comparable book on this topic exists , and after reading it it is not hard to understand why there is so_much polarization . Blum reports the tactics of animal advocates , ranging from protest demonstrations and legislative initiatives to personal death threats , arson and laboratory break-ins . One group , the Animal Liberation Front , is violent enough to be_on the FBI ' s terrorist list . On the other side , she describes in gruesome detail historical research by a_few bad-apple scientists that have done great harm to their profession . However , she also visits the labs of first-rate investigators who explain how they go_about minimizing pain and suffering and why their work should matter_to the world . Blum , a science writer for the Sacramento Bee , received a Pulitzer Prize for an earlier series of newspaper_articles on the same subject . Based on visits to the most important facilities and in-depth interviews with key participants , she is generally extremely well-informed . Both sides no doubt view her account as biased against them , which will only go_to show how balanced it really is . While enumerating various medical triumphs , Blum does not hide her shock at certain conditions and practices . She sympathizes_with animal advocates who take_issue with the way animals are being treated without giving them so_much as a finger on the one thing many of them would like to see , that animal research be abolished altogether . Blum succeeds admirably at sharing their concerns without losing sight of what is at stake for society . After all , anyone entering a hospital or picking_up a prescription at the pharmacy makes use of animal testing . Realizing that the way we look_at such research is not the same as it was 20 , or even 10 years ago , Blum follows a middle course culminating in a plea for a more enlightened treatment of animals in our care and for open debate instead of the continued hostility . Blum ' s interviews demonstrate how intensely personal many of these issues have become . She describes Alex Pacheco of PETA ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) as a passionate animal defender , yet also relates his unwillingness to allow veterinarians to euthanize a monkey , thus prolonging the animal ' s misery . Apparently , moral_obligation took a back seat to political expediency . Pacheco ' s chief adversary , Peter Gerone , director of the Tulane Regional Primate Research_Center , on the other hand , is depicted as an indefatigable champion of research , who says about the animals he works with : &quot; I don ' t relate to monkeys and I don ' t want to . It would bias my ability to direct a center that does research on them. &quot; The nasty battle between Pacheco and Gerone over the fate of the Silver Spring monkeys -- removed , in 1981 , from a Maryland laboratory -- has set the tone of confrontations between animal advocates and researchers ever since . Blum provides us with thumb-nail sketches of these and other players . There is plenty of personal drama , including scientists who claim that their career went_down the drain because of their sympathy for animals , and administrators who have managed to build_up cozy relationships with animal advocates . One of the most interesting sections deals with Harry Harlow , whose early work_on monkeys reared in isolation was critical for our understanding of the affection needs of primates . Harlow subsequently went overboard , however , designing one experiment after another to see how best to thwart these needs . William Mason , one of Harlow ' s ex-collaborators , distances himself in unmistakable terms from this later research . Harlow ' s ghost may still be with us , but he is not here anymore to defend himself . In this day and age , it is unlikely that his experimental protocols would be approved . They would meet with resistance not only from the outside but also from inside the research community . An entire generation of scientists has grown_up with increased awareness of the special responsibility that we as a species have toward other species . They are not convinced of having a God-given right to do whatever pleases them . As Blum explains , the research community is not a monolithic block ; many different voices can be heard , including those that argue for radically different ways of conducting science . Primate research facilities have adopted strict guidelines for research , and are moving from keeping their animals singly in stainless_steel cages to housing them in groups in spacious enclosures or outdoor compounds . Some research_centers now keep the majority of their animals in this fashion . I was naturally pleased to see my own institution , the Field Station of the Yerkes Regional Primate Research_Center in Atlanta , Ga. , singled_out as a model to be emulated . The philosophy behind this facility , as well as a_few others that successfully combine social housing and biomedical research , is that in the end everyone gains from psychologically healthy animals . Primates evolved as social beings ; there is no better and more natural way to enrich their lives than providing them with companionship . At the same time , making their existence more variable and satisfying may make them more suitable research subjects . Blum urges animal advocates to step back a little from the fences around research facilities so as_to appreciate the genuine progress made by some . Looking beyond the positions of the most radical animal advocates and the most conservative defenders of scientific freedom , we can see an entire middle ground_out there . It is not a place for simple slogans , nor for neat boxes marked &quot; right &quot; and &quot; wrong , &quot; but one where the large majority of people will feel a lot more comfortable than on the barricades erected over the past decade . It is a place where both animal and human lives count , and where we can honestly and calmly ponder the so-called pain / gain equation , that is , how much pain we are prepared to inflict for scientific gain . &quot; The Monkey Wars &quot; documents the shifting of this balance . It argues that the time has come_to close our ears to the yelling proponents of the most extreme positions and tune_in to voices of reason and moderation . As in the Middle_East , not everyone may be happy with dialogue , but it has to be tried if we ever wish to get beyond the current standoff .</TEXT>
