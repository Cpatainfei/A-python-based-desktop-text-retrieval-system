   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ' S LOST WINE COUNTRY ; OUT OF THE PAST : CUISINE DE GUASTI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In its heyday , the Italian Vineyard Co . boasted more acreage than any vineyard in the world . Now it ' s only a memory that surfaces when one hears the name Guasti . Secondo Guasti was an Italian immigrant who built his wine empire in the Cucamonga Valley and created the town of Guasti . Born in Mombaruzzo in the province of Piedmont , he arrived in Los Angeles in 1883 and founded the vineyard company in 1900 . He died in 1927 . Penniless when he arrived , Guasti later lived_in a mansion on West Adams Boulevard in Los Angeles that was said to have cost $ 500 # 000 to build . In the first decade of this century , that was an extravagant sum . During his lean years , Guasti worked for a time in a restaurant . In his showplace home , the food was eclectic , a mix of Italian , Chinese , Mexican , French and sophisticated American , judging by the recipes of his wife and daughter-in-law . * These recipes appear in a privately printed cookbook published in 1930 . &quot; The Junior League Recipe Book , &quot; riddled with names of prominent Angelenos , includes recipes by Mrs . Secondo Guasti ( Louisa Anna Amillo ) and Mrs . Secondo Guasti Jr . ( Gertrude Orcutt ) . The Guastis also contributed a full-page ad that promoted their cooking Sherry . &quot; For foods that linger long in memory , try Sherry -- the flavor secret of master chefs , &quot; the ad said . ( During Prohibition , the wine was salted to make_it unfit for drinking but legal to sell. ) The ad also mentions &quot; the famous Guasti Wine Jellies , &quot; and the book includes a wine jelly recipe from Mrs . Guasti Jr . Light in flavor and texture , it is more like a dessert than a stiff jelly to spread_over toast . Some of the Guasti dishes are simple , such_as &quot; Little pig canape &quot; from Mrs . Guasti Jr. , which consisted_of broiled baby sausages_rolled in small French_pancakes . Others were extravagant , such_as the senior Mrs . Guasti ' s bouillabaisse that required barracuda , lobster , clams and oysters . The lobster was to be cut_in pieces &quot; like cubes of sugar , &quot; she specified . * Mrs . Guasti Jr . liked to experiment with ethnic foods . She contributed enchiladas that were filled with cheese , olives and hard-boiled_eggs and topped with a red sauce that required several dozen dried chiles . Her chop_suey called_for chicken_breast meat at a time when packaged parts weren ' t available . One had to buy a whole chicken and cut it up_to get the breast , as the recipe instructed . Their Italian contributions included minestrone , spaghetti_sauce , fritto misto ( which was a mixed fry of lamb chops , veal brains , sweetbreads , chicken_livers , artichoke hearts and mushrooms ) , stuffed zucchini , artichokes stuffed with anchovies and bread crumbs , spinach frittata and zabaione , an airy dessert of egg_yolks , sugar and Guasti Sherry beaten over hot water until light and thickened . The Guasti way_of_life was disrupted within a_few years of publication of the cookbook . Secondo Guasti Jr . died in Santa Barbara on April 6 , 1933 at the age of 42 . His widow remarried in 1935 and moved to New York . The elder Mrs . Guasti , who was only 15 when she married , died in 1937 , 10 years after her husband . Her luxurious home and its contents were sold at auction . Here are four of the Guasti recipes , adjusted to contemporary ingredients and cooking procedures to make them usable today . MRS .
