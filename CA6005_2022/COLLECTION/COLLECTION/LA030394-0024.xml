   <HEADLINE> THE $ 50 # 000 BONBON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Something goofy is going_on at the Hotel del Coronado , because right there at the entrance of the Crown Room -- the elegant dining_room where the Duke_of_Windsor was introduced to Wallis Simpson , where L . Frank Baum dreamed_up much of the &quot; Wizard of Oz &quot; -- stands a walking , waving , button-eyed Doughboy . Next to him is a green-skinned sprite named Sprout , apparently the preferred spokesboy of the Green Giant company , which is now part of Pillsbury , where chipper is better than jolly and gigantic . It ' s barely past 6:30 in the morning , too early for cartoon mascots . But the breakfast crowd gathered under the crown-shaped chandeliers for the 36th Pillsbury Bake-Off is wide awake . The coffee and adrenaline flow freely , and a Dixieland jazz_band pumps the mood even a notch higher . Game-show and Bake-Off host Alex Trebek shows_up toward the end of breakfast , after the 100 contest finalists have received pep talks from Pillsbury ' s top_executives , and he seems to be the only one affected by the early hour . Later he will walk through the contest hall , face powdered and expensively sweater-dressed , like a good TV personality , but at the moment he is appearing as America rarely sees him -- without makeup . No one seems to mind . &quot; Oh my God , it ' s Alex , &quot; says a finalist to her husband , at first embarrassed to be overheard . &quot; Well , he ' s just so smart and handsome. &quot; In real_life , Trebek seems destined to play the role he was given_in Robert Altman ' s &quot; Shortcuts &quot; -- a celebrity to be ogled from afar -- every time he steps into public view . There ' s just one last order_of_business before the contestants make the grand march into the Bake-Off hall . Everyone stands , the band begins to play and the crowd sings &quot; God Bless America. &quot; &quot; Now , doesn ' t that feel better ? &quot; says Rob Hawthorne , Pillsbury ' s chief operating officer . &quot; I love tradition. &quot; &quot; I think I ' m going_to cry , &quot; the Trebek fan says . &quot; I mean , this whole_thing , it ' s an American tradition. &quot; The first Pillsbury Bake-Off , in 1949 , was devised , company representatives say , as a way to lure women back into the kitchen after they ' d had a taste of the working life during World_War_II . Just as the science of home_economics , a_few decades earlier , made housewives feel they had a profession , not simply a list of daily chores , the Bake-Off was meant to bring glamour , patriotism -- and big money -- to America ' s home bakers . &quot; A woman seldom bakes a cake , a pie , or a batch of cookies for herself , &quot; wrote Ann Pillsbury , then director of Pillsbury ' s Home Service , in the contest recipe booklet published just after the 1951 Bake-Off ( called the Grand_National at the time ) . &quot; But through the foods she bakes , she expresses her thoughtfulness and love to her family , her friends or her church. &quot; Art Linkletter was the celebrity host that year , and first prize , $ 25 # 000 , went_to Mrs . Samuel P . Weston of La Jolla and her Starlight Double-Delight Cake . Women were listed by their husband ' s names through 1976 , when Mrs . Bert Groves and Mrs . Edward F . Smith co-won the grand prize . These days , the people at Pillsbury look sheepish when they admit the contest ' s early intentions . But they are quick to point_out that today ' s 100 finalists are a diverse lot . &quot; They are ' doers , ' &quot; says this year ' s Bake-Off program , &quot; with successful careers , who also enjoy a variety of leisure and volunteer activities. &quot; Before the last couple of Bake-Offs , Pillsbury went_out of its way to attract cooks of all ethnic_groups . Some entry forms were printed in Spanish . Others were published in places where Asians , African Americans and other ethnic cooks would find them . Still , the majority of the finalists are female and white -- this year there are eight men . But only 21 of the women consider themselves full-time homemakers . And there are a lot more savory recipes in the contest these days -- mostly due_to corporate expansion . With Green Giant in the Pillsbury family , things like frozen and canned vegetable products made_it onto the list of required ingredients . ( Each recipe must include at least one Pillsbury product , say , the Refrigerated All Ready Pizza Crust or Ready to Spread Frosting Supreme. ) It would be easy to make_fun of all this corporate corn . But as the finalists suit up in their royal-blue aprons and get their final instructions ( &quot; You ' ll walk in twos . Meet your partner in the hall where the Sprout and Doughboy are standing -- then proceed to your ranges &quot; ) , it ' s hard not to get caught_up in their excitement . Inside the hotel ' s Grande Hall , stern-faced Pinkerton guards ensure that only badged guests are allowed into the viewing area . A Pillsbury coordinator exchanges nervous small_talk with the Sprout , only to be interrupted by one of the guards : &quot; Could you step back ? We need to get the Doughboy on camera. &quot; Finally , to the sounds of march music and rhythmically clapping hands , the contestants enter the hall , just behind George and Sarah Pillsbury , the grand marshals of this &quot; parade. &quot; ( Their role is largely symbolic . Pillsbury is now owned by the_British corporation Grand Metropolitan PLC , but CEO Paul Walsh knows the value of keeping the family involved in the Bake-Off. ) The first contestants in the hall are bouncy , all smiles , and they wave enthusiastically to the Pillsburys and to the cameras . As more finalists stream in , the waves grow limper ; some don ' t bother to wave at all , so intent and nervous are they to get_to their ranges . A man stands_out of camera-shot , frantically waving to the contestants , reminding them to look perky , not panicked . Many of the finalists have been through this before ; the Bake-Off attracts a lot of cooking-contest regulars , though the rules have been changed so that cooks can be finalists only three times . A woman ' s voice on the loudspeaker can barely be heard over the noise , but the contestants seem to hear her : &quot; Please go_to your kitchens . Bake-Off 36 is under way. &quot; Each station is equipped with an electric_range from Sears , a pitcher of ice_water and a mauve banquet chair , possibly for emergency rest breaks . A few ingredients are out_in view -- margarine for Number 11 , Betty Chromzack ; butter , eggs and cream_cheese for Number 6 , Rebecca Moe -- but most are put_away in the Sears-provided cabinets . At first , there ' s a lot of opening of cabinets and checking of equipment . Suddenly an aproned woman runs_out of the hall . &quot; I put too_much lotion on my hands ! &quot; she shouts_out to her family gathered_in the observing area . &quot; My hands are too slick to bake ! &quot; She ' s off in search of a ladies room . Thirty minutes after the contest is officially under way , the press and corporate guests are allowed to roam the ranges and pepper the finalists with questions . But the families and friends must stay behind the rope -- &quot; for security reasons , &quot; one woman explains . &quot; I guess they think we ' re going to give them a secret ingredient or something. &quot; Already there are media favorites , the cooks with the stories and perky good looks that attract press attention . There are the Wittans -- Joan and Susan and their mother Mildred . Each is a finalist and the camera loves them . Joan ' s husband , Mark , has been a finalist in the past . And most of the Wittans are here in Coronado for a reunion -- the family that bakes-off together . . . well . Then there is Wayne Hu , at age 77 proud to be this year ' s oldest contestant . He ' s making Chinese Roast_Pork Buns out of Pillsbury Refrigerated Buttermilk_Biscuits . He came_to the U.S. in the ' 40s from Shanghai . &quot; Food is what you miss the most , more_than friends , &quot; he says . He does the Chinese cooking in the family . &quot; My wife cooks American food. &quot; Tasha Marie Sullivan , at range Number 1 , gets a lot of camera attention , mostly because her daughter is strapped into a mommy pouch across her chest . Sullivan ' s child_care fell_through at the last minute , so she keeps a close watch on little Aina as she works_on her potato-and-corn empanadas , dubbed Cheesy Potato ' n ' Corn Empanadas for the contest . Catchy , cutesy names are important to Pillsbury . The guiding philosophy : Why say and when you can say ' n ' ? Many of the reporters call 28-year-old Alex De Santis the Tom Cruise of the Bake-Off -- he prepares his Chicken , Bean and Barley Stew from start to finish behind dark wraparound sunglasses and talks_of blowing any possible winnings in Vegas after the contest . As many women have noted , he ' s single . Six hours are allotted for the Bake-Off -- the finalists make three versions of their entries ( one for judging , one for photos and one for sampling ) , but the time goes quickly . By 12:30 , with just an hour and a half left before time is up , panic starts to set_in . No one has ever not finished at the Bake-Off , but there are problems . A record number of Band-Aids have been handed_out -- so many they ' ve lost count at the front desk . Then a reporter from the Washington Post discovers that some of the Sears refrigerators aren ' t cold enough to chill the non-bake pies in the contest . Kenmore-gate ? Gabby technicians are hustled away from the press and an official explanation is given : So many cakes and pies needed chilling this year that the doors were constantly being opened and closed -- there ' s no problem with the equipment itself . The Post reporter looks doubtful . As 2 o ' clock nears , Kristen Crowley at Range 18 struggles with her Toffee Mocha Pie ( a refrigerator pie ) alongside Eileen Long at Range 19 , who has had trouble all morning adjusting the oven temperature for her Mai Mai Sweet_Potato Pie . Over at Range 97 , Shirley Tompkins hustles through the final slicing and arranging of her Braided Yam Coffee_Cake for the judges . At 1:55 p.m. , Long , the last finalist , is off the floor . The Pillsbury people look relieved -- a perfect record preserved . The next morning , still stuffed after a private dinner show at_Sea World -- &quot; I feel_like one of those dolphins who automatically opens his mouth whenever someone snaps a finger , &quot; says one finalist -- everyone gathers_in the hotel ballroom for the announcement of the winner . The proceedings , hosted by Trebek , are taped for broadcast later that morning on CBS . After the usual preliminaries , during which Trebek manages to work in the word &quot; jeopardy &quot; three or four times , six $ 10 # 000-category winners are called to the stage , which is designed like a homey kitchen , complete with refrigerator magnets and Pillsbury products . Two of the women well_up with tears when their names are called , and they hold hands tightly as they sit on stools placed around a kitchen island . It ' s just like the end of a beauty contest . One of them will be the $ 50 # 000 grand-prize winner . A silver-cloched tray is brought_out to the counter . Underneath is the winning entry . Trebek takes his time building_up the tension , and then the cloche is lifted , the name is announced . It ' s Mary Anne Tyndall of Whiteville , N.C. Her recipe : Fudgy Bonbons . Sweet and gooey wins again . * Food Styling by Donna Deane and Staci Miller</TEXT>
