   <HEADLINE> RELIGION ; TAKING COMMAND ; SALVATION_ARMY GEN . RADER IS REGARDED AS AN INNOVATOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Salvation_Army Gen . Paul A . Rader , the newly chosen top brass for an organization known best for its relief work , Christmas kettles and uniformed street_corner musicians , is expected to bring some unorthodox ideas developed in Southern California to the staid global church body . The Salvation_Army center in Northridge has been one test_tube for these innovations . Rader , who has been commander of the 13-state western territory based in Rancho Palos Verdes since 1989 , was called &quot; innovative &quot; and &quot; a visionary &quot; by Salvation_Army workers in the San Fernando Valley area . The lean , 60-year-old Rader became the first American-born officer to win the top Salvation_Army post in a special election last Saturday in London , where the army was born and is still headquartered . He returned to Los Angeles from London on Friday evening to prepare_for his permanent move_back to take command . &quot; We want to be_on the cutting edge of evangelism and the social_service , &quot; Rader said in an interview after being greeted by a Salvation_Army band at Los Angeles International Airport . &quot; I think there is always a tendency for a 129-year-old organization to settle_down in comfort , but our track record here has been to encourage innovation . . . &quot; As head of the western territory , Rader launched five experimental New Life Centers aimed at attracting &quot; unchurched &quot; baby_boomers to informal , music-and-discussion sessions without the usual quasi-military trappings . Beginning Sept . 3 , the Northridge New Life Center , nine months in the making , will launch &quot; Nite Life , &quot; a weekly Saturday night gathering for music , discussion and gourmet coffee -- but no hymns , no prayers , no uniforms , according to Cecil and Joy Sellers , the envoys , or noncommissioned_officers , in_charge . &quot; This is Gen . Rader ' s brainchild , &quot; said Cecil Sellers , whose Northridge home has so far served as headquarters . &quot; Ours is the fifth New Life Center started in the western territory and only the second in California -- quite a bold venture for the Salvation_Army . &quot; We don ' t see a need for a worship service until we have believing Christians who want to come_to services , &quot; said Cecil . At last count , the Salvation_Army had 450 # 000 members in more_than 1 # 150 congregations in this country . Even at the rather conventional Salvation_Army congregation and community_center in Van Nuys , a Saturday night coffee house featuring a different Christian entertainer each week was added in April to the usual Sunday worship schedule . Lt . Troy Trimmer , newly assigned to Van Nuys with his lieutenant-wife Analene , said that attendance has been small but should improve with better publicity . Trimmer said that the army ' s new general will stay with tradition where it continues to work well , but &quot; if certain methods don ' t reach people , we won ' t stick_with them just because tradition is involved. &quot; This strategy comes largely from concepts Rader was exposed to after interrupting his missionary_work in South_Korea for two years to study for a doctorate in missiology at the School of World Mission in Pasadena ' s Fuller Theological Seminary . &quot; He came_to us quite discouraged because he saw the Presbyterian_churches growing and the Salvation_Army was not , &quot; said Arthur F . Glasser , a former dean at Fuller who was Rader ' s mentor from 1971 to 1973 . At the end of that time , &quot; he produced a dissertation that was very practical and beautifully written , &quot; Glasser said . Paul Pierson , who followed Glasser as dean of the school of world mission , said that Rader &quot; really re-energized the Salvation_Army in Korea when he returned. &quot; After Rader and his wife , Kay , ended 22 years of service in South_Korea in 1984 , they took posts in the eastern United States . He rose to the rank of territorial commander , briefly heading the eastern territory , then came_to California to assume command of the western territory . &quot; The school of world mission , which has had more_than 3 # 000 graduates since 1965 , named Rader alumnus of the year in 1992 in recognition of his achievements , &quot; said Pierson , who is currently interim pastor of Bel Air Presbyterian_Church in Encino and teaches part-time at Fuller . The Salvation_Army , best known for its social_service and emergency relief work , has been ever present during a series of California earthquakes and fires . Even here , Rader was not always the conventional leader . Besides the 250 # 000 gallons of water , 140 tons of clothing and other assistance provided by the Southern California division following the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , Rader canceled officer training classes at headquarters for two weeks so that 90 cadets and 30 faculty_members could join in relief tasks . &quot; He ' s a hands-on leader , remembers people and is a very fine speaker , &quot; said Capt . Stephen Hartt , who administers the army ' s 84-bed Adult Rehabilitation Center in Van Nuys , part of the army ' s nationwide network of alcohol and drug recovery centers . In remarks to the press this week in London , Rader said the Salvation_Army remains a theologically conservative , evangelical denomination with a pronounced social conscience . &quot; All across the world our mission is the same : to preach the Gospel of Jesus_Christ and to live it out_in compassionate service to the neediest among us , &quot; he said . &quot; We specialize in the hard cases. &quot; Salvation_Army founder William Booth , a former Methodist , began the organization in London in 1865 . The American branch was created in 1880 . A daughter , Evangeline Booth , headed the U.S. movement from 1904 to 1934 . When she was chosen to lead the international_organization from 1934 to 1939 , she had already become an American citizen . But American-born Salvationists , as they often call themselves , were shut_out of the top post in later years . &quot; It appears there had been a reluctance to pick a general of the international army from the largest and wealthiest of the army branches , &quot; said Diane Winston , who is completing a doctoral dissertation at Princeton_University on the Salvation_Army and U.S. popular culture . On Friday , Raider waved away any suggestion of an anti-American bias in the army . &quot; In recent years , we ' ve had Canadians and Australians , a Swede and a Finn , as general , &quot; he said . &quot; I like to think it ' s always been the right person for the moment. &quot;</TEXT>
