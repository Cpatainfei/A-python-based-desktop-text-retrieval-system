   <HEADLINE> SERBS GRAB BACK HEAVY_WEAPONS NEAR SARAJEVO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After pummeling the helpless town of Gorazde while a paralyzed world looked_on , Bosnian Serb renegades grabbed back 18 heavy_weapons from U.N. peacekeepers Tuesday in an ominous sign that the deadly bombardment of Sarajevo could resume at the rebels ' whim . The devastation in Gorazde carried_on unhindered . The last few foreign relief workers trapped in the vanquished city reported scenes of suffering and destruction in the U.N. safe area abandoned to a brutal fate . Four fieldworkers for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , huddled in a basement shelter with the last four U.N. soldiers in Gorazde , ventured above ground during a lull in the shelling and reported &quot; a scene of desolation , debris everywhere and gaping holes in apartment buildings. &quot; More_than 200 shells tore through the refugee-thronged city_center in late morning , the aid agency workers told colleagues here , noting that they saw about a dozen bodies strewn on the pavement outside one shelter that took a direct hit . In Washington on Tuesday , the Clinton_Administration said it will seek European and Russian support for new military and diplomatic pressure against Bosnian Serb forces , including wider air strikes against military targets and stiffer economic sanctions against their allies in Belgrade , the Serbian and Yugoslav capital . But it remained unclear whether new threats and economic measures would induce the Serbs to forfeit territory won by force and return to the bargaining table . And in Russia , President Boris N . Yeltsin issued a sharply worded statement warning the Bosnian Serbs to keep their promises to Russia and halt the assault on Gorazde . Russia -- which has resisted stronger Western action in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- has been a key Serbian ally and had won what appeared to be a major foreign_policy coup for itself by temporarily achieving some advances in the Balkan peace process . The latest Bosnian Serb outburst has become a major embarrassment for Moscow . In Gorazde , the rebel attack persisted Tuesday despite another promise by Bosnian Serb leaders in nearby Pale to hold fire and allow deployment of a small peacekeeping force into the ravaged enclave . As artillery shells rained_down on the defeated Muslim enclave at the rate of more_than one per minute , the roof was blown_off the city ' s hospital ; that facility is packed with the wounded from 20 days of siege . Serbian nationalists who have vanquished Gorazde by cinching an artillery noose and forcing tens of thousands of inhabitants into the center relentlessly fired on the penned-in civilians in an assault U.N. officers here condemned as serving no imaginable military purpose . &quot; Sniper fire has increased and is contributing to the general air of panic , &quot; said U.N. Protection Force spokesman Maj . Rob Annink . Radovan Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb political_leader , had assured the U.N. civilian affairs chief a day earlier that his forces would abide_by an agreement that was already vastly scaled back from previous U.N. proposals for helping Gorazde . It would have allowed Bosnian Serb-escorted aid convoys and the deployment of about 260 U.N. troops after a cease-fire that never materialized , Annink said . &quot; It was just a scrap of paper and its worth was only that of the people who agreed to it , &quot; he said of the latest unfulfilled promise . &quot; The other side does not keep to its word. &quot; Evacuations to relieve the crowded , starving enclave cannot be carried_out until the Bosnian Serbs stop attacking the people whom relief agencies want to remove for their own safety . The rebels , whose campaign for a Greater Serbia has lately careened out of any outside power ' s control , still hold more_than 100 U.N. troops hostage and have been moving them around among secret locations in an apparent plot to use the peacekeepers as human shields against further air strikes . Some of the captives are believed to be held at the rebel barracks at nearby Lukavica , where about 50 armed Serbs stormed a U.N. weapons collection site Tuesday and intimidated French troops into relinquishing stored weapons , according to Lt . Col . Richard Pernod . About 30 French troops were_on duty when the rebels showed_up in_force to demand the return of their weapons , said Cmdr . Eric Chaperon . U.N. officials said three days earlier , after Serbs moved a tank to another weapons collection site to demand its arsenal , that the peacekeepers were under orders to use force to prevent Serbs from seizing the weapons . &quot; They were simply overrun , &quot; Chaperon told journalists . &quot; If they had fired , it would have been a massacre. &quot; By grabbing the antiaircraft_guns that were warehoused in February under the NATO ultimatum , the Serbs have sent a warning that a renewed drive to defeat Sarajevo could begin at any time . They have also defiantly flouted the standing North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization order for punitive air strikes against any heavy weaponry within a 12-mile radius of Sarajevo . The seizures represented another escalation of the campaign of harassment and humiliation of U.N. forces conducted by rebels who have been dangerously emboldened by the peacekeeping mission ' s reluctance to stop the savagery inflicted on Gorazde . The Serbian nationalists appear to be gambling that NATO also lacks the stomach to take them on . There were reports late Tuesday that the Bosnian Serbs may have relented some in their seizures of guns and detentions of U.N. personnel . Reuters news service quoted Chaperon as saying that the Bosnian Serbs had returned many of the guns and pledged to free many of the detained U.N. teams . There were few details , and the report could not be independently confirmed . Last week , Bosnian Serbs retaliated for token NATO air strikes by kidnaping U.N. troops , mining and blockading U.N. patrol posts and refusing to talk to officials of the peacekeeping force . Since the civilian chief of the mission , U.N. special representative Yasushi Akashi , refused to authorize air strikes after British soldiers were deliberately targeted by the Serbs and one was killed , the rebels have stepped_up their harassment and intensified attacks on Gorazde and in other battle zones along Bosnia ' s nearly 700 miles of active front_lines .</TEXT>
