   <TEXT> Two quick-thinking bystanders Wednesday rescued two people who were badly burned when a smoldering mattress ignited a house fire , authorities said . The structure blaze , which broke_out about 10 a.m. in the 19100 block of Community Street , erupted when fresh air provided oxygen to set the smoldering material aflame , said Michael Little , a Los Angeles Fire_Department spokesman . Van Nuys roofer Tim Agee was atop a home across the street from the fire and Franz Glubiak , a retired Rocketdyne worker who lives_in the neighborhood , was standing outside his home when they heard screams for help and saw the smoke . &quot; We were standing in the street about 50 yards away when we heard someone screaming , ' Help , fire ! ' and we saw the smoke , &quot; Glubiak said . &quot; I ran_over there and the roofer came_down and we saw the man and woman lying_in the house and they were_on fire. &quot; As about 15 bystanders watched , Glubiak and Agee rushed into the house . They first pulled_out a 37-year-old paraplegic man who was lying on the mattress as it burned . Then they went_back in and aided a woman who had been carrying the mattress . She was badly burned around her head and neck , Agee said . The rescuers used their hands to put_out the flames on both victims ' bodies . A man who had also been carrying the mattress was able to escape_from the house . A young boy inside the house escaped unharmed , Agee and Glubiak said . After the rescue , Glubiak and Agee hooked up two garden_hoses and extinguished the blaze before fire crews showed_up about four minutes after receiving the call . Officials did not identify any of the fire victims . Glubiak , 64 , a former rescue worker in the coal mines of Belgium , said he is all too familiar_with the scenario and acted from instinct when he heard the screams . &quot; I knew right away what I had to do , &quot; he said . &quot; Get the people out and get the fire out. &quot; Agee , 29 , said he couldn ' t stand outside the home and do nothing while he listened to screams for help . &quot; No one else would go near the fire , but people were screaming and burning to death , &quot; Agee said . &quot; We got them just in time , because the hallway went_up in flames just a second or two after that , &quot; Agee said . The disabled victim was transported to Northridge Hospital Medical_Center where he was treated for second- and third-degree_burns to over 90 % of his body , Little said . The female victim also was taken_to the Northridge hospital , where she was treated for second- and third-degree_burns over 40 % of her body , Little said . The man who got_out of the house was treated for burns on 20 % of his body at the West Hills Regional Medical_Center , Little said . About 20 firefighters worked less than 15 minutes to finish extinguishing the blaze , Little said . The cause of the fire is under investigation .</TEXT>
