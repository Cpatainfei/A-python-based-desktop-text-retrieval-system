   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN EXPRESS TO SPIN OFF LEHMAN BROS. ; FINANCE : THE INVESTMENT BANKING UNIT WILL BECOME AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY , LEAVING A CORE OF SERVICE BUSINESSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stripping away the last of its ill-starred Wall_Street acquisitions , American Express said Monday that it will spin_off its Lehman Bros . investment banking unit into an independent company owned by American Express shareholders and Lehman employees . What will remain is a core of service businesses -- the signature charge_card , corporate services , travel and financial planning -- that can be marketed under the American Express brand name , said Chairman and Chief_Executive Harvey Golub , who took_over a year ago with a mandate to streamline and invigorate the firm . Following the $ 1-billion sale last March of the Shearson retail brokerage business to what is now Travelers Corp. , the long-predicted Lehman spinoff will complete the reversal of what had been the strategy of Golub ' s predecessor , James D . Robinson III . Robinson had acquired disparate financial services companies in what proved to be a vain hope that they would fit together . American Express said it will inject $ 1.09 billion in capital into Lehman to make the newly independent company financially viable and assure it an &quot; A &quot; credit rating . In exchange , American Express will get a share of Lehman ' s potential future profits , as well as the share of Travelers profits Lehman receives as a result of the sale of Shearson . But the former parent will have no directors on Lehman ' s board . Lehman employees will pay $ 160 million for newly issued shares of Lehman stock , boosting the total capital infused into the new company to $ 1.25 billion -- the amount Golub said credit ratings agencies told him was needed to get the good rating . Strong ratings are critical for securities firms , in part because they depend_on short-term borrowing in their day-to-day business . &quot; We will end_up with two separate entities at the end of the day , both of which are prudently and adequately capitalized and both of which will end_up with excellent ratings from the ratings agencies , &quot; Golub said . American Express said its shareholders will receive a dividend in the form of stock in the newly independent Lehman . The spinoff will be completed in May or June , Golub said . When American Express sold Shearson to Travelers , Travelers Chairman Sanford Weill did not want the Lehman segment of the business , which specializes in investment banking , trading and underwriting new issues of stocks and bonds . So American Express held_on to the unit while taking steps to shore it up for an eventual sale . The spinoff will give Lehman executives what they have dreamed of for years : freedom from American Express . Long an independent pillar of Wall_Street , the august Lehman Bros . was acquired by American Express in 1984 and merged with Shearson . But the Lehman culture never fit with Shearson or American Express , and the firms never developed the synergies that Robinson envisioned . Instead , during crisis periods for Shearson Lehman , American Express had to pay more_than $ 2 billion in capital to the securities businesses . American Express also announced its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings Monday . For the quarter , it reported income from continuing operations of $ 291 million , or 57 cents per share , compared to $ 255 million , or 51 cents , for the same period in 1992 . The spinoff was not announced until after the markets closed Monday . American Express stock closed_up 62.5 cents at $ 31.50 on the New York Stock_Exchange .
