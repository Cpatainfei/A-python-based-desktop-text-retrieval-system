   <TEXT> Re &quot; The Sexual Harassment Jackpot , &quot; Commentary , Sept . 7 : Katherine Dowling expresses complete ignorance of an important human_rights issue , sexual_harassment . &quot; Good manners &quot; have nothing to do with it leand neither does &quot; sexual attraction. &quot; She makes a similar blunder when she intimates that sexual_harassment first occurred with the &quot; sexual revolution. &quot; Sexual harassment is all about power , control and intimidation . Oftentimes it has been used to exert that power and control in the workplace , preventing a co-worker or subordinate from gaining a promotion , or even earning a livelihood . Through the court system the harassed have regained some of that human dignity and respect . A juror from the recent newsworthy case ( Sept . 2 ) cited by Dowling summed it up best when he was quoted as saying , &quot; We wanted to send a message to Baker &amp; McKenzie that if they continue with this kind of conduct , they can expect the retaliation of the court system. &quot; Dowling needs to educate herself as_to the law and as a physician needs to sensitize herself to what the true issues are that may face her patients . Unfortunately , a &quot; tongue &quot; alone has not protected people in the past from harassment , but luckily laws and their enforcement do . DEBORAH D . HARRIS Los Angeles I take_exception to Dowling ' s superficial assessment of sexual_harassment . Proposing to fight the pervasive and debilitating social plague of sexual_harassment with nothing more_than &quot; good manners &quot; and &quot; common_sense &quot; is like trying to combat cancer with two aspirins and a good_night ' s rest . While it may be true that chauvinism is a permanent part of any society , if we , as a nation , hope to effectively combat the devastating effects of sexual_harassment , then we must commit ourselves to a more aggressive campaign whereby punishments are both substantively meaningful and enforced . If that means multimillion-dollar jury verdicts against convicted harassers , then so be it ! SUSAN EVANS Manhattan Beach One can only assume that Dowling was distracted by a &quot; buff guy &quot; while writing this absurd commentary , which clearly displays a distorted perception of social mores , history , sexual_harassment and genetics . S . KANANI FONG La Habra Heights Pretty please with sugar on top -- more Dowling commentaries . LISA KIJEK Downey</TEXT>
