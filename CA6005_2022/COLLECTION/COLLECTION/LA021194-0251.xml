   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : CORMAN NEARS SALE OF B-MOVIE LIBRARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Roger Corman , king of the B-movies , is looking_to cash out -- again . After selling New World Pictures in 1983 , Corman says he ' s close to striking a deal for his cult-classic library , which was not part of the original sale . Included in the package are &quot; Death Race 2000 , &quot; &quot; Big Bad Mama , &quot; &quot; Stepmonster &quot; ( &quot; She ' s Mean . She ' s Green . She ' s Your New Mom ! &quot; ) and &quot; Carnosaur &quot; -- not to be confused with Steven Spielberg ' s dinosaur movie . Corman refuses to name his asking price or the prospective buyers . But industry sources say he began shopping the 250-plus titles around last year for $ 20 million to $ 30 million . People close to the company say the deal remains lucrative , despite rumors that the price has been lowered to about $ 18 million and that Corman has had a tough time finding a taker . By selling the library now , Corman hopes to capitalize on the surging interest in entertainment programming that began with the Paramount Communications takeover battle . One analyst joked that there are enough films in the library to create a &quot; Roger Corman Cable Network &quot; if all_the hype surrounding the 500-channel cable universe becomes reality . Concorde-New Horizons Corp. , the successor to New World , will not be part of the deal . Corman says he intends to continue making 20 or so movies a year . &quot; I have no plans to retire in any way , &quot; said the producer , who turns 68 in April . While he operates well outside the mainstream and on small margins , Corman is known as one of Hollywood ' s craftiest businessmen . The title of his 1990 autobiography , &quot; How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime , &quot; is indicative_of his reputation , though Corman confesses that he actually did lose money on a small number of them . Corman is also known for being strictly private about his financial activities . He ' s peddling the library without the aid of an investment_banker or any other formal adviser . Asked to asses its worth over lunch at The Grill one day , Corman responded : &quot; Neither we nor the prospective purchasers know what it ' s worth . It ' ll be our guess against theirs. &quot; One concern among people who have passed_on the library is that there may be some cross-ownership problems , which Corman ' s company denies . Others worry that the movies are too short , too violent or too weird for broadcast TV . &quot; You couldn ' t base an entire channel around the films , because there aren ' t many big stars , &quot; said one buyer . &quot; But it might make_sense for someone who already has a big library. &quot; Corman insists there ' s still plenty of room in the marketplace for his brand of movie . With the death of the drive-in theater partly to blame for B-movie revenue falling 76 % from 1989 to 1991 , Corman and his management team -- which includes video president Jonathan D . Fernandez and sales manager Bill Bromiley -- have shifted much of the company ' s attention to the video market . * Roughly 70 % of Corman ' s films go directly to videotape -- with the big sellers including its record-setting &quot; Carnosaur &quot; ( 85 # 000 copies ) , &quot; Blood Fist IV &quot; ( 40 # 000 copies ) and a family movie called &quot; White_Wolves &quot; ( 55 # 000 copies ) . The other 30 % does most of its theatrical business in small_towns . And about 50 % of the company ' s overall business comes from foreign sales . Corman has also survived largely by sticking_to the low-budget , high-volume formula he developed some 30 years ago . &quot; The Fantastic Four , &quot; which is now in post-production , ranks as a major undertaking by Corman standards , at $ 4 million . Most of his movies still cost less than $ 2 million . Corman also develops 75 % of his ideas in-house , using a stable of beginning writers and directors who work_out of a former lumberyard in Venice that Corman calls &quot; The Factory. &quot; It is a well-known part of the Corman legend that past pupils have included Jack Nicholson , Martin Scorsese , Francis Ford Coppola , Ron Howard , Robert DeNiro and Jonathan Demme . Forget about a lengthy development process or round-table rewrites : &quot; If we want to make a picture , we decide in 30 minutes and start shooting three days later , &quot; Corman says . People close to Corman say it ' s not surprising that he has avoided the temptation to make a big-budget movie over the years , given his conservative style . One associate remembers Corman stepping into a beat-up , unrecognizable car after lunch one day . Corman explained that it was a prop car that had just been blown_up for one of his movies . Corman agrees that he ' s most comfortable operating outside the traditional film community , but he also challenges the way his films are most commonly labeled . &quot; These are not B or B-plus pictures , &quot; Corman says . &quot; These are A-minus pictures . It ' s a subtle differentiation. &quot; * They do_it their way : The French , fierce protectors of_their_own culture and well-known lovers of Jerry Lewis , also have a thing for Paul Anka , it turns_out . Anka was recently named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the_French Minister of Culture for his international contributions to music . The performer was in Paris to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his best-known songwriting achievement , &quot; My Way. &quot;</TEXT>
