   <HEADLINE> STARTING OVER ; FOR BETTER FOREIGN_POLICY : TALK TO THE PUBLIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. political_system grants the presidency enormous power in foreign affairs . With this power comes the responsibility not only to guide the ship of state , but also to educate and inform the American people -- a task the President , and only the President , can adequately carry_out . As the first U.S. leader of the post-Cold War era , Bill_Clinton has to recast the foundations of U.S. foreign_policy . Not since 1945 has a President had such weighty responsibility to mold public thinking about the nature of the nation ' s engagement abroad . Clinton has thus far failed to fulfill this responsibility . As a result , he must now redouble efforts to exercise presidential leadership in foreign affairs . Regardless of the course of action he decides to pursue in Haiti , North_Korea and whatever comes next , Clinton must embark_on an explicit campaign to educate the American public about its responsibilities abroad . David R . Gergen ' s move from the White_House to the State_Department , to focus_on foreign affairs , should help get the message across . But if muddled signals -- or only silence -- continue to emanate from Washington , Americans will remain confused about their role in a world without a Soviet threat . The potential cost is high : the country ' s gradual disengagement from international affairs . Since the beginning of the 20th Century -- when the United States became a great_power -- Americans have tended to be ardent internationalists when foreign dangers arise , and ardent isolationists in the absence of pressing external threats . The country entered World_War I to prevent German domination of Europe , only to withdraw from the international scene during the 1920s and 1930s . The United States paid a high price for its disengagement . Left unchecked , Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan developed_into powerful aggressor states . Their defeat cost thousands of American lives . From the close of World_War_II until the end of the Cold_War , the Soviet_Union kept the United States engaged in Europe and Asia . With the collapse of the Soviet_Union , the scope of American involvement abroad is once again shrinking . If history is any guide , we are drifting toward a new isolationism . This drift can be reversed -- but only if Clinton persuades Americans that they should continue to expend blood and treasure to defend an international order no longer threatened by communism . Even if he decides the United States should engage only gingerly in pressing matters of the day , the President still must explain his decision to the public . Clinton is clearly up_to the task : He is articulate and charismatic when addressing the nation about domestic policy . He must now apply his talents elsewhere and overcome his decided reluctance to use the presidency to forge the political and conceptual underpinnings of a new foreign_policy . The costs associated with Clinton ' s unwillingness to play a more prominent role in shaping public attitudes are not yet fully apparent . The Congress and the people it represents remain internationalist ; Americans still appreciate the importance of U.S. leadership and of continued U.S. engagement in world affairs . But this brand if internationalism is a residue of the Cold_War . It will not last . Unless Clinton increases the visibility of foreign_policy and informs the American people of the principles that guide that policy , he will ensure that the next generation of Americans and the leaders they elect will be of a different cast . However politically attractive it may seem to allow foreign_policy to slip_off the radar screen , the country ' s long-term interests necessitate ambitious efforts to educate the public . When he chooses to act -- and especially when he chooses not -- Clinton must use prime-time television to explain to the American people the interests at stake . Saturday morning radio addresses will not do . Paradoxically , the end of the Cold_War has increased , not decreased , the need for presidential leadership in foreign affairs . From 1949-1989 , successive U.S. Presidents had only to point to a pervasive Soviet threat to garner public support for enlarging the defense budget or sending troops far from U.S. borders . Now , Clinton must shape public attitudes with new arguments and clearly articulated actions . And because there is no global external threat , there is no neat formula or doctrine to guide policy . Like it or not , the President must get_in the trenches and regularly explain to the nation the opportunities and dangers of a world undergoing deep transformation . To be sure , Clinton ' s top priority should be the long-neglected domestic agenda . But the Administration must_not underestimate the long-term effect of downgrading public discourse on foreign_policy . Once isolationist myths take_root , they are hard to dispel . Franklin D . Roosevelt battled tenacious strains of isolationism as he tried to prepare the country for World_War_II . Not until Japanese planes attacked Pearl_Harbor could the American people be convinced of the need for engagement . By that time , Nazi Germany had already overrun most of Europe . To regain a foothold on the Continent , the Allies had no choice but to storm the beaches of Normandy . In the late 1940s , Harry S . Truman faced similar obstacles in persuading Americans to bear the costs of containing the Soviet_Union . Despite the Truman Administration ' s repeated efforts to dampen isolationism and fuel anti-communism , it took the outbreak of the Korean_War to persuade Congress to undertake a major military buildup . By taking steps now to sustain American internationalism , Clinton will ensure the United States plays its role in building a stable post-Cold War order . More important , he will be making a low-cost investment to ensure that Americans do not again drift into the illusory safety of isolationism . The United States is at a critical historical juncture . Under Clinton ' s leadership , the country has embarked_on an ambitious program of domestic renewal . Clinton ' s legacy already appears impressive : a more fair , competitive and prosperous country . But Clinton is also presiding over the remaking of the country ' s foreign_policy and is determining whether Americans turn inward or outward as they address domestic renewal . The rest of the world watches with anxiety ; it is desperate for American leadership . Unless Clinton makes foreign_policy a more prominent element of his presidency , his legacy will be a prosperous country -- but one withdrawn from the international arena . The last time that happened , the world went_to hell . It is up_to Clinton to ensure that , 50 years from now , Americans again descend on Normandy to commemorate , not to repeat , the rescue of the world from that hell .</TEXT>
