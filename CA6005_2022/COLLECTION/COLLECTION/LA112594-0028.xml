   <HEADLINE> THE WEAPON OF CHOICE ; DIPLOMACY IS A WINNER AS U.S. GETS KAZAKHSTAN ' S MILITARY-GRADE URANIUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The foreign_policy crises that make headlines are those that involve slaughter , starvation and flight . Sadly the list is long : Haiti , Somalia , Bosnia , Rwanda , Burundi , East Timor and others . But when foreign_policy experts list the major threats to international security , scarcely any one of these tragedies is at the top . What tops a great many such lists is nuclear proliferation . This fact is what makes the quiet , admirably professional negotiation that led to U.S. acquisition of half a ton of weapons-grade uranium from Kazakhstan a greater security achievement than any of the Clinton_Administration ' s other recent foreign_policy successes . This lethal material could have been used to make dozens of bombs , and it was recovered from a region from which nuclear material was making its way onto the black_market last summer . The end of the Cold_War counts only if nuclear war -- the almost unimaginable horror that made the Cold_War what it was -- also is ended . The termination of the decades-long armed standoff between the United States and the former Soviet_Union has ended the likeliest scenario for nuclear Armageddon . Unfortunately , the collapse of the Soviet_Union and of the totalitarian control that Moscow had maintained over its citizens has greatly raised the potential for nuclear smuggling and nuclear blackmail . Some of the worst anxieties have centered around Kazakhstan . Because this now-independent republic lies at the interior of what was the Soviet_Union , it was home to many weapons installations . But it is a Muslim country to which , for cultural reasons , emissaries from Iran and Afghanistan have relatively easy access . Islam is no more equated with terrorism than any of the other major world religions ; at_the_same_time , terrorism by Muslim extremists is too_large a fact of international life to be passed_over in discreet silence . The Clinton_Administration negotiators , led by Ambassador William H . Courtney , a former nuclear arms negotiator , deserve credit for a service to the cause of international security . Their success comes as a reminder that if , as Prussian general Karl von Clausewitz said , war is &quot; a continuation of political_relations , a carrying_out of the same by other means , &quot; then the reverse is also true . Some military or national security goals can only be pursued by political_relations , and nuclear non-proliferation is one . No increase in military spending could accomplish what this negotiating team has accomplished . Whatever the social chaos in Kazakhstan , whatever the certainty of exporting its nuclear war-making capability , U.S. military intervention would remain out_of_the_question . As we confront nuclear terror in the form it will take_in the years ahead , brilliant diplomacy will by far surely be the defense &quot; weapon &quot; of choice .</TEXT>
