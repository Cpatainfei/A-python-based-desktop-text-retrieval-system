   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; LOOKING_BACK ; VALLEY STUDENTS WHO FOUGHT PROP . 187 REFLECT ON A BATTLE LOST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They were disorganized , often petulant , dressed in baggy clothes and too young to even vote . But San Fernando Valley students waged one of the most visible campaigns in the statewide battle over Proposition 187 , staging school walkouts and mass demonstrations . And after a loud and furious two weeks , most spent Wednesday in quiet reflection . The day after California voters overwhelmingly approved the initiative barring illegal immigrants from most government services , daily routines seemed to go_on as usual , even at Valley clinics , welfare offices and schools -- institutions where the measure is intended to have its greatest impact . Even so , many Latinos receiving government services -- whether prenatal care or a college education -- on Wednesday revealed a dispirited resignation to the prospect that life would very likely become more difficult . Even those living_in the United States legally fear that the passage of the initiative will encourage bigotry . &quot; First they will target illegal immigrants . Then they will target us -- the ones who look_like we are immigrants , &quot; said Senia Calderon , 19 , of San Fernando , a single mother and legal resident who receives welfare for her 1-year-old son . Others , such_as Ruben Reyes , a legal resident who was awaiting immunization shots for his 11-month-old son at the Pacoima Health Center , predicted that little will change for illegal immigrants until authorities begin enforcement of Proposition 187 . &quot; When they see some kind of action , that ' s when people are going_to stay away , &quot; he said . Robert L . Scott , speaking_for the United Chambers_of_Commerce of the San Fernando Valley , said he and the majority of members celebrated passage of the initiative but oppose the expected use of public funds to challenge the law in court . He said he believes student protests were prompted by teachers and school officials opposed to the initiative . &quot; Adults were influencing the kids to do this , &quot; he said . Student leaders in the Valley , meanwhile , spent the day assessing their tactics , wondering if they could have done more to defeat the initiative : Should they have just stayed in class ? Waved American instead of Mexican flags ? &quot; We tried as much as we could but maybe we didn ' t make our voices clear , &quot; said Mandy Evans , a 15-year-old Birmingham High_School student . &quot; What can we do ? We ' re not old enough to vote. &quot; But with a protracted legal fight over Proposition 187 expected , students said that in the not-so-distant future their loud opinions will make a difference . &quot; Right now we can ' t vote but in four years we will be able to vote and we won ' t let people like Pete Wilson get_in office and we won ' t let propositions like 187 pass , &quot; said Marjorie Garcia , a 17-year-old Sylmar High student . * The short but spirited student campaign to defeat Proposition 187 was for Marjorie and thousands of other Latino students a landmark political event . If they grow_up to be the political force that demographers predict , they could make_good on the threat against Republicans and others who supported the initiative , political experts and educators said . San Fernando High_School Principal Philip R . Saldivar said despite criticism , the protests motivated his student body . &quot; I want to keep their political interests going . These are our next voters , &quot; he said . Said Aaron Diyarza , 17 , a San Fernando High student : &quot; One thing we learned . . . is that voting is important. &quot; Others expressed the disappointment more typical of youth . &quot; I was hoping it would make a difference , change people ' s minds , &quot; said Hector Estrada , 18 , who joined the walkout last week at San Fernando High_School . &quot; It didn ' t really do much. &quot; Only three Los Angeles city schools reported walkouts Wednesday -- Venice High_School , Hamilton High in West Los Angeles and Olive Vista Middle_School in Sylmar . At Cal State Northridge , about 200 mostly Latino students gathered for a noon rally , carrying a black coffin and posters with messages such_as &quot; What am I , Citizen or Suspect. &quot; CSUN student sophomore Vladimir Cerna , an illegal immigrant and an elected student body officer , said passage of the initiative marks &quot; open season &quot; on the undocumented . &quot; Hopefully , it will be stopped in the courts , &quot; he said . &quot; But even so , the atmosphere is there . If you assume someone is illegal , you can say or do anything you want to them. &quot; As evidence , he cited vandals who painted &quot; wetbacks out &quot; and &quot; illegals out &quot; on the school ' s Chicano House the day before the election . At the East Valley welfare office in Panorama City , several single mothers -- both legal and illegal residents -- said they were not concerned about the immediate consequences of the proposition because of expected legal challenges . * Besides , they said , state law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving most forms of public aid , such_as Medi-Cal and Aid to Families with Dependent Children . Their U.S.-born children are eligible for benefits even if they are not . But the women said they feared passage of the measure would open the door to discrimination because of their accents and appearance . Carmen Martinez , 33 , said her five children are frightened that they will get_into trouble at school because they speak Spanish and have brown skin . &quot; I have told them not to be afraid because they were born here , &quot; said Martinez , a Mexican native and legal resident of North Hollywood . Welfare_workers were ordered not to comment . A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social_Services , Carol Matsui , said the department was conducting &quot; business as usual &quot; until it receives instructions from the state_Department of Social_Services . There was little evidence of the new law at Olive View-UCLA Medical_Center and other county medical facilities in the Valley , despite a requirement that doctors and nurses report to authorities patients suspected of being illegal immigrants . County health officials said they were instructed by county Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed not to begin checking patients ' immigration status until the county receives guidelines from state and federal_officials . Some illegal immigrants awaiting care said even if Proposition 187 is enforced , they would have no choice but to seek needed care , regardless of the risks . They also expressed anger at supporters of the anti-immigrant measure . Margarita Castro , 26 , an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was seeking care_for her infant daughter at the Pacoima health clinic , said she was angry over voters seeking to punish immigrants even though &quot; We ' ve been giving a lot by working more for less. &quot; Teresa Lopez , another illegal immigrant from Mexico , said she was not worried that staff_members at Olive View hospital -- where she gave_birth to a girl Monday -- might turn her in . &quot; If they deport me , I ' ll be back , &quot; said Lopez , 22 , in Spanish . &quot; In their hearts , someday they ' re going to pay_for what they ' re doing. &quot; Times staff writers Leslie Berger , John Chandler , Jack Cheevers , Abigail Goldman , Jocelyn Y . Stewart and special correspondent Maki Becker contributed to this story .</TEXT>
