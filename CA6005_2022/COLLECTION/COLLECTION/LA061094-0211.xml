   <HEADLINE> U.S. , WESTERN ALLIES URGE RUSSIA TO COOPERATE MILITARILY , OPEN DIALOGUE ; EUROPE : NATO SEES SOUND RELATIONS AS ' A KEY ELEMENT FOR SECURITY AND STABILITY. ' BUT INVITATION FALLS_SHORT OF MOSCOW ' S DEMANDS FOR WIDER ROLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of their efforts to build a new , post-Cold War relationship with Moscow , the United States and its European allies Thursday urged Russia to immediately join a program of military cooperation and begin an extensive political dialogue with NATO . &quot; Good , cooperative relations between NATO and Russia will be a key element for security and stability in Europe , &quot; stated a communique issued after a meeting here of the foreign_ministers from the 16-member North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . But the foreign_ministers stopped far short of Moscow ' s demand for a formal consultative role in Western Alliance affairs -- something that many believe would have dangerous implications , including opening the door to de_facto Russian veto powers . Moscow has already declared that it wants to participate in the military cooperation program , known as &quot; Partnership for Peace. &quot; The program offers such things as joint maneuvers , closer high- and mid-level contact and technical assistance in weapons development and procurement . Since it was launched earlier this year , 20 non-NATO nations , including most of Moscow ' s onetime Communist allies , have joined . But partly because of Russia ' s desire to gain a degree of influence over NATO decision-making and partly because of internal domestic pressures from conservative hard-liners , Moscow has demanded special treatment as the price of involvement . Last month , at NATO headquarters in Brussels , Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev talked_of the need for a broad dialogue with the alliance on European issues from nuclear non-proliferation to the environment . Other Russian officials have subsequently pressed NATO for a special protocol to formalize this dialogue . Establishing a constructive working relationship with Moscow on security issues is considered one of the most important , yet difficult challenges currently facing the Western allies . They must create a link that does not alienate Russia again from the mainstream of European events . At the same time , however , analysts say the relationship should not permit Moscow to bend events to its will , as it did after the Allies gave Stalin a free hand in Eastern Europe at the ill-fated Yalta Conference in early 1945 . In an attempt to ease concerns of the Central and Eastern European_countries , which only five years ago were part of the Soviet empire , NATO Deputy Secretary_General Sergio Balanzino rejected the idea that cooperation would lead to what he called &quot; a Yalta II. &quot; Still , the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has underscored that , despite its internal economic chaos and for all its domestic political turmoil , Russia remains a major_power with considerable influence -- even when its nuclear missiles are not at_issue . &quot; It ' s an urgent necessity to build the Russians into the European security_system and fully clear that a power this size has to be handled differently than Iceland , &quot; said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel . But Thursday ' s communique , described by one senior U.S. official as NATO ' s answer to Grachev , offered Moscow only an informal dialogue &quot; in appropriate areas outside the Partnership for Peace , &quot; and pointedly reaffirmed &quot; NATO ' s right to take its own decisions on its own responsibility by consensus of its members. &quot; At a news_conference after Thursday ' s meeting , Balanzino stressed the informality of the proposed political discussions . &quot; Political consultations ( with Russia ) would be_on a case-by-case basis on matters of mutual concern , &quot; he said . Balanzino said no details of the proposed consultations were discussed at Thursday ' s meeting . But a British official close to the talks listed nuclear safety , counter-proliferation and nuclear cooperation policy as potential subjects . At a news_conference , British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the West ' s military relations with Russia would be based on a simple formula : &quot; No vetoes by Russia , no surprises sprung from the West and substantial cooperation. &quot; A NATO ultimatum in February to Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw from Sarajevo or be bombed surprised , angered and embarrassed Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and temporarily complicated the West ' s efforts to cooperate with Moscow to bring an end to the Bosnian war . Russia ' s initial reaction to the NATO offer could come almost immediately . Moscow ' s foreign_minister , Andrei V . Kozyrev , was scheduled to hold talks here Thursday night and today with Balanzino , and a Kozyrev meeting with U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher is scheduled for today . Despite the lack of any offer of a formal political dialogue , Christopher urged Moscow to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement , describing it as , &quot; the major strategic development in Europe since NATO was formed. &quot; Other officials said they hope the communique ' s positive tone toward Moscow will make_up for the lack of substance . &quot; It is good , warm language , a positive signal that will allow Kozyrev and people like him to come_to Brussels and sign , &quot; a British official said . &quot; We hope this will give him enough to say to those in Moscow , ' The hand ' s extended ; let ' s shake it. ' &quot; Besides dealing with Russia , the NATO communique reaffirms the alliance commitments in Bosnia , including enforcing a &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over the former Yugoslav republic .
