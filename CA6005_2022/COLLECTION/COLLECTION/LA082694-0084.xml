   <HEADLINE> INDIA ; IN LAND OF SACRED COW , PLAN TO IMPORT MANURE SEEN AS WASTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In India , where cows are sacred , one commodity should exist in abundance -- besides milk , that is . A Dutch company , Seaswan , begs to disagree and has devised an ambitious scheme to ship some of that other product , generated by the_Netherlands ' cows , to India for fertilizer . &quot; Oil_tankers go_to Europe and then come_back empty , &quot; explains Albert van der Struik , agricultural counselor at the Royal Netherlands Embassy in New Delhi . &quot; Couldn ' t that excess capacity be used to carry manure ? &quot; Small and densely populated , the_Netherlands has serious soil and water_pollution problems caused by its large dairy and animal-husbandry sector . Strict environmental laws limit the amount of manure that farmers can produce per acre . When they increase their milk or meat output by breeding more animals , Dutch farmers must get_rid_of the excess dung , Van der Struik said -- hence Seaswan ' s idea . A feasibility study , financed in part by the European Union , is considering whether the plan makes business sense . One idea is that bio-gas be extracted from the manure in the_Netherlands first , and perhaps used to generate electricity . Then the dung , which could be mixed with water into a slurry to make_it easier to transport , would be loaded onto tankers in Rotterdam . In India , the reception given Seaswan ' s scheme ranges from the commercially curious to the downright hostile . A small but vocal group of Indians views the plan as just another way for a rich country to dump its trash in the Third_World . &quot; The proposal is seen as part of the reckless opening_up of the economy to all kinds of_imports ranging from Coca-Cola , Kentucky Fried Chicken and Kellogg ' s breakfast cereals to McDonald ' s hamburgers ( which are to be free_of beef ) , Hollywood soap_operas through satellite television and obsolete American automobile technology , &quot; fulminated the Telegraph newspaper of Calcutta , which is largely hostile to the free-market reforms being carried_out by India ' s ruling Congress Party . Shekhar Singh of the New Delhi environmental group Kalpavriksh said he couldn ' t understand the logic of Seaswan ' s scheme , because India already has more manure than any other country in the world . Because of Hinduism ' s ban on cow slaughter , India has the world ' s largest cattle population , with 192 million cows . It is equally true , however , that a lot of manure in India is now dried and used for fuel . &quot; This is a country with an enormous need for organic matter in the soil , &quot; Van der Struik contends . Supporters of Seaswan ' s proposal note that manure is a lot more ecologically sound than chemical fertilizers . According to the Telegraph , an Indian company , EID Parry , has already joined hands with Seaswan and is seeking more local partners . The reported plan is for the Dutch manure to be shipped to Gujarat , a western Indian state , in quantities averaging 6 million tons annually to start . &quot; It sounds very absurd to me , &quot; Singh said . &quot; Who is going_to buy_it at this end ? And you can ' t just come and dump it at the port in Gujarat . A lot of people will object , because it will seem like waste dumping. &quot; Somebody in the_Netherlands must have anticipated problems with the project . Initially , the proposed export item was given the snazzy name &quot; eco-dung &quot; ; it has since been changed to &quot; organic fertilizer. &quot; &quot; It ' s in a very early stage , &quot; Van der Struik said . &quot; Nothing may come of it. &quot; In fact , religious taboos -- but not the religion that believes cows are holy -- could torpedo the whole project . Seaswan had originally eyed Saudi_Arabia as its most promising market , Van der Struik said , but had to back_off that idea because &quot; eco-dung &quot; will also contain manure from pigs , an animal that Muslims hold to be particularly unclean . &quot; I can ' t imagine that being used for fertilizer here , &quot; Singh said . &quot; India has far more Muslims than Saudi Arabia. &quot;</TEXT>
