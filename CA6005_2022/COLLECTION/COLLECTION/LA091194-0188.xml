   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : GERMANY ; ISLAND PLAYGROUND IN THE NORTH_SEA ; WITH FAIRY-TALE VILLAGES , CRYSTAL AIR AND WIDE UNSPOILED BEACHES , FOHR HAS CHARMED GERMANS FOR CENTURIES BUT IS LARGELY UNKNOWN TO AMERICANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Don of Canterbury himself met us at the ferry that dropped us in Wyk on the North Frisian island of Fohr . &quot; Welcome to Fohr , &quot; said the Don ' s companion , Chrystl Flugare , greeting us warmly . &quot; Did you know , by the way , that there are more Fohrians in the United States today than remain here on the island ? &quot; This native imbalance was news to us . However the Don -- actually a sturdy , off-white Scottish_terrier -- barked in vigorous corroboration , shaking himself for emphasis . Flugare , a Hamburg hotelier and an old friend , had invited my husband Bill and me to spend a_few days on Fohr ( pronounced Fur ) , in the North_Sea off Germany ' s west coast , to experience the island ' s unspoiled natural beauty and spectacular bird life , as well as its healthy , invigorating climate and unique architectural charms . Drawn by the sea air and Fohr ' s bracing breezes , Danish King Christian VIII spent his summers on the isle from 1842 to 1847 , along with his 100-odd entourage . Hans Christian Andersen and Johann Strauss also whiled away the weeks at Wyk . The Waltz King ' s Nordseebilder waltzes were penned in a small house on Wyk ' s boardwalk in 1879 , between beach hikes and cafe forays , no doubt . Today , Fohr is visited largely by Germans ( many from nearby Hamburg and from Berlin ) as well as neighboring Danes and the Dutch . They and others come_to the island in search of a quiet , no-hassle summer and early fall vacation filled with clean air , abundant animal life and low prices in an unspoiled natural setting . Flugare drove us through Wyk ' s harbor on the island ' s southeast corner , with its colorful melange of weather-beaten shrimp cutters , tidy yachts and yawls . On the deck of one vessel sat a fisherman amid long , grayish , rectangular nets overflowing with tiny pink North_Sea shrimp , called krabben , the local delicacy . Plump , white and woolly sheep grazed on the inland side of the ancient 25-foot dike encircling most of the island -- a descendant of the original sea wall built_in 1492 after a great flood . In the distance on gentle inland slopes were dozens of gyrating electricity-generating metallic white windmills , looking_for all_the world like giant tai chi devotees . Our comfortable apartment was in a two-story , russet-roofed , red brick building behind a blooming screen of white beach lilies and wild roses , off the south beach . One look_at the spectacular sight from our living room windows and we congratulated ourselves on being there . Framed by tall beach pines was a wide expanse of beach interspersed with delicate turquoise rills of sea water . Beyond was the indigo blue North_Sea topped with a shimmering , silvery sky dotted with clouds in perpetual motion . The sand flats or wattenmeer ( literally &quot; cotton sea &quot; ) , as the Germans call it , surrounds the North Frisian isles . They are a part of Germany ' s largest national_park . While the Don ( &quot; Doni &quot; to his friends ) explored sandcastles , we dug our toes deep into the inviting sand , gradually imbibing Fohr ' s special atmosphere and light . The late September air we inhaled was cool , crisp , crystal_clear -- the stuff of which the island ' s reputation as a health resort was built . In fact , Wyk -- Fohr ' s main village and only port -- was already a kur-ort or spa and bathing resort in 1819 , well before Christian VIII ' s first royal visit . And there are still local kur hotels that offer something like the 19th-Century Victorian cure : a regimen of massages , mud packs , salt water inhalations and saunas . * The beach , strewn with old-fashioned wicker beach baskets in rainbow stripes and shaded with varicolored awnings , mirrored a scene out of &quot; Death in Venice. &quot; We walked along the wattenmeer gathering seashells , tiny snails and other fauna . The light around us changed constantly from soft gray to pale blue to dark gray and , unexpectedly , to a luminous pinkish mauve as the clouds hastened past and the sun ' s last rays blazed through . This light show , peculiar to the North_Sea , infiltrated Dutch paintings such_as Vermeer ' s and suffuses Emil Nolde ' s colorful , often careening art . Across the narrow , flag-adorned mittelbrucke ( or middle bridge ) pier is Wyk ' s picturesque main_street . The boardwalk is separated from the beach by islands of low sea grass , elms and beach pines . Its outdoor cafes , chic boutiques and emporiums with souvenirs and clothing made of local wool are housed in low , white-gabled and balconied red brick edifices . Flugare took us for a ride the next morning . Doni accompanied us , occasionally emitting his own , inimitable sightseeing insights . Fohr is a roundish oval about 7 1 / 2 miles long by 5 miles wide , of sandy moraine and alluvial marsh . Because it lies inside the other North Frisian isles of Amrum and Sylt , closer to Germany ' s Schleswig-Holstein coast , Fohr is somewhat protected from North_Sea storms . From afar , Fohr ' s small villages look_like miniature woodlands encircling fairy-tale thatched-roof houses . Amrum ' s red lighthouse and the spire of Nieblum ' s St . Johannis church loom above the trees . Nieblum is known as the prettiest village in Germany ' s Schleswig-Holstein ' s state . On both sides of its cobblestone main_street are delightful Frisian houses of pink brick or white stone . Their overhanging , olive-tone thatched roofs are rounded , lending structures the look of awkward , plump , yet somehow endearing dumplings . The window_frames and doors , painted blue , sport carvings of whales , whaling ships and an occasional windmill over an arched doorway . Entwined in the white pocket fences bracketing the homes , when we were there last September , were red and pink roses , giant dahlias and fuchsias in bloom . The whales and nautical symbols , Flugare explained , go_back to Fohr ' s &quot; Golden Age &quot; from 1600 to 1800 , when seafaring and whale-hunting were the island ' s chief occupations . In 1760 there were only 64 sea_captains on Fohr . A decade later , more_than 150 Fohrian captains commanded Dutch , Danish and Hanseatic whaling expeditions . Setting_out in late February for the Greenland region , they were joined by more_than a third of Fohr ' s population of 4 # 500 . All that ended about 1800 when the Napoleonic wars and conflicts between England and Denmark effectively halted sea commerce . Hundreds of Fohrians emigrated over the next decades ( and again after both World_Wars ) for economic and political reasons . By the mid-19th Century , particularly after gold was discovered in California , 70 % of the able-bodied men , followed by 30 % of the women , left the isle . that ' s why you ' ll find more Fohrians overseas , especially in America , than here , Flugare said . At Nieblum ' s meeri , or pond , dozens of green-headed mallards , mottled ducks , black scoters and gaggles of bean geese and eider_ducks strolled along the water ' s edge , dove in or sunned themselves on the grass . The more enterprising and hungrier birds took nourishment from the hands of several giggling toddlers . The Don barked energetically as we drove further west toward Gotting Kliff . Looking_up , we saw an arc of black_and_white lapwings , eider and gray plover winging overhead . A 27-foot high , one-mile long promontory , Gotting Kliff was formed by the wind and water depositing stones , boulders and sand ashore , then withdrawing their bounty . From Gotting ' s peak we gazed down on the wild and beautiful rock-strewn beach and the giant boulders shouldering the shore . Black-and-white Holsteins and the rarer brown-and-white Frisian cattle grazed on the marshy pastures beyond the Kliff . The other side of the road was aglow with yellow rape fields : Rape_oil is used as a gasoline substitute on environmentally correct Fohr . * The North Frisian islands extend from Denmark to the_Netherlands along Europe ' s west coast . Politically and culturally the islands seesawed back and forth between German and Danish influence until 1864 , when the Prussian dukes of Schleswig-Holstein claimed the North Frisians for themselves . The Fohrian dialect is closer to English than to German , Danish or Dutch . The name Fohr is supposedly derived from the Frisian dialect word feer ( dry_land ) -- a dry haven , indeed , the isle must have seemed to the Vikings who wandered south down the North_Sea in the 9th and 10th Centuries to settle there . In Witsum , founded during the Middle_Ages as were most of the isle ' s villages , we stopped at Joe ' s Smoke Barrel to buy smoked eel -- another local treat . &quot; My father , my grandfather and his father were all fishermen here , &quot; said Joe , whose last_name we never learned . &quot; The men in the family went whaling in the 1700s . They made a good living. &quot; Fohr ' s chief industries today include dairy_farming , mining of sea salt and fishing for mackerel , eel and mussels . After lunch on Wyk ' s boardwalk ( scrumptious krabben soup ) , we rested briefly in our apartment . Our quarters included a cozy bedroom , spacious bathroom and combination living / dining_room and kitchen , with the homey comforts of a VCR , dishwasher and microwave . The next morning with Hamburg hotelier and restaurateur Helge Walter , Flugare ' s longtime companion and our old friend , we were back in Nieblum at the 13th-Century St . Johannis Kirche . In the church cemetery , among bittersweet and blooming impatiens , are more_than 260 tombstones dating_from the 17th to the 19th Century . Some are adorned with elaborate Baroque designs , others bear biblical illustrations . Three windmills seemingly at full tilt mark miller Hans Christiansen ' s grave . Capt . Karsten Karstens ( 1687-1763 ) , one of many high-ranking seamen interred there , is symbolized by a whaling ship with sails furled , indicating that he died at a ripe old_age . The full sails on Capt . Peter Peterson ' s tomb denote that he expired young . From Osterland ( Fohr ' s eastern portion ) we continued to Westerland ( the isle ' s western part ) and paid a visit to St . Laurenti ' s church , also of Romanesque origin . After admiring a glorious 15th-Century altar piece housing 12 saints , we went_in search of Fohr ' s most famous citizen , Matthias Petersen or Peter Matthies , born in Oldsum in 1632 . Matthias captured 14 whales on a single voyage and a total of 373 before he retired -- as explained on his tombstone -- earning him the nickname &quot; Matthias the Fortunate. &quot; Lunching outdoors at Kleines Helgoland near Wyk ' s marina , we watched Elfriede , a spiffy two-masted ketch glide out of the bay as two loaded shrimpers came_in . Later we walked along the footpath on the flat , narrow ridge of the ancient seawall that meanders around most of the isle . A whale bone archway leads to Wyk ' s Frisian Folklore Museum . The replica of a captain ' s cabin aboard ship , in the extensive whaling exhibit , reminded us of the captain ' s house in Oldsum . One imagined generations of whalers sitting and rocking in the chairs by the fire in the pesel or parlor reproduced nearby . That evening we dined superbly at Altes Pastorat , a charming , 300-year-old former manse , now an inn and restaurant . Later , walking on the beach , the full_moon ' s midnight rays illuminated our path among the sandcastles and old-fashioned wicker beach baskets . The Don emitted a great sigh . . . of contentment ?
