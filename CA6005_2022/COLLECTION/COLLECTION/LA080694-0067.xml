   <HEADLINE> BASEBALL ' S THREATENED WALKOUT STRIKES MANY OBSERVERS AS CURIOUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' d bet my life that team owners are responsible_for the juiced baseball . It ' s their most potent strike-breaker . They knew that by feeding the egomaniacal prima_donna players a juiced ball , many would be flirting_with statistically magical seasons . If there ' s a strike , all possibilities vanish . Any impressive achievement would be asterisked into obscurity . The owners are not as dumb as they look . Next year , the ball will be unjuiced , lest their employees start thinking they deserve more money . DONALD E . FRICKE Northridge * Ozzie Smith hopes it will be a short strike because the younger players really can ' t afford to be out_of_work . Excuse me , Ozzie , but aren ' t these same young players making $ 115 # 000 a year ? Here ' s hoping the owners use Ozzie ' s $ 25 # 000-per-game salary to keep the peanut vendors , line cooks and ushers on the payroll during the players ' strike . They are the ones who really can ' t afford this . RON ANTONETTE Seal Beach * It ' s hard to feel sorry_for a bunch of guys who make millions of dollars each year , stay in nice hotels , eat free meals , are paid a per diem so they can eat elsewhere too , get_to play free golf , and play mediocre baseball , all with a negative attitude . I say cap them out at $ 100 # 000 because it ' s a hell of a lot more_than they would make in the real_world , where accountability really means something . JOE LINS Corona * Strike or no strike , you can bet the Dodgers will have a salary cap night for all_the fans in_attendance . DWIGHT CATES Ventura * During a strike , it ' s not unusual to find management stepping_in to take_over for the workers . Here are some early scouting reports on some future major leaguers . Marge Schott : Like Dykstra ; chews tobacco . Ted Turner : Hits to all fields ; wife ' s a drag . Peter O ' Malley : Looks_like Clark Kent , hits like Lois Lane . Fred Claire : No help coming_out of the pen . Tom Lasorda : Crafty left-hander ; Seems to have conquered weight problem . George Steinbrenner : Pain in arm ; pain in knee ; pain in butt . STEVE POSS Long_Beach * Baseball strike ? Yawn . Who cares ? KEITH ROBERTS Mission Viejo * Attention , baseball owners ! I used to say if given the chance , I would play for a bus_ticket and a sack lunch . I ' m over 50 now , but I haven ' t changed my mind . KERRY BURNSIDE La Habra * If the main thing for the owners is a cap on salaries , return to one-year contracts and the salary risk is almost eliminated . JOHN H . STEVENSON San Marino * Hey , guys , if there ' s a strike , you won ' t be able to watch 10 players scratch , spit and twitch for minutes on end while waiting for an occasional foot to touch home_plate guarded by a padded , well-protected player . Back to soccer , where 22 players are working hard , nonstop against one another all_over a field larger than any football_field , whether the ball goes near or into a 24-foot by 8-foot net protected by an unpadded player .
