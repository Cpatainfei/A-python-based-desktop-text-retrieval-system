   <HEADLINE> NEW INGRAM MICRO UNIT TO HANDLE HIGH-VOLUME SALES ; COMPUTERS : THE CREATION OF THE SUBSIDIARY COULD MEAN THE ADDITION OF AT LEAST 50 JOBS AT FIRM ' S SANTA ANA HEADQUARTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Computer distributor Ingram Micro Inc. said Wednesday it will create a subsidiary to handle high-volume computer sales . The company said it expects the new unit to have annual revenue of $ 1 billion within a year and that its creation could mean the addition of at least 50 jobs at its Santa Ana headquarters . The subsidiary , which will start in August , will be called Ingram Alliance Reseller Co . Instead of focusing_on Ingram ' s regular computer wholesale business , the new unit will specialize in selling computers to large retailers known as resellers , which repackage computer equipment with custom software . David Dukes , co-chairman of Santa Ana-based Ingram Micro , said the new business will let Ingram Micro compete with so-called aggregators -- large resellers such_as the Intelligent Electronics computer_store chain . Such retailers , which have invaded the turf of distributors , order such large volumes of computers from manufacturers that they can get wholesale prices and distribute their goods to other computer resellers . &quot; Ingram Alliance ' s mission is to provide resellers with a one-stop source for all_of their product and service needs , &quot; said Doug Antone , a former executive at software firm Borland International who will serve as president of the new unit , which also will be based in Santa Ana . Dukes noted that Ingram Micro ' s conventional business -- distributing computer equipment to a wide variety of computer sellers -- is suffering from an ever-increasing squeeze on profits as PC prices fall . Ingram Alliance will offer large volumes of name-brand computer equipment at discount prices that otherwise aren ' t available in its general distribution business . It could also boost profits by charging fees for services such_as configuring computers for custom settings , financing computer leases and providing technical support .</TEXT>
