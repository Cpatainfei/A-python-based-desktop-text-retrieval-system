   <HEADLINE> NATO CHIEF WOERNER DIES ; PRESIDED AT COLD_WAR ' S END ; EUROPE : FORMER WEST GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER WAS 59 . HE GUIDED ALLIANCE ' S SEARCH FOR NEW SECURITY ROLE IN THE ' 90S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Manfred Woerner , the former West German defense minister who led the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization for six crucial years that spanned the end of the Cold_War and the collapse of the Soviet_Union , died Saturday following a long battle with cancer . A statement issued at NATO headquarters here said Woerner , 59 , died at his home_in Brussels . &quot; Under his skillful and strong leadership , he has led the transformation of the alliance from an era of confrontation during the Cold_War to the present period of cooperation and partnership , &quot; the statement said . &quot; He was the driving force behind NATO ' s transformation. &quot; As NATO secretary_general from July , 1988 , until his death , Woerner presided over the alliance ' s search for a new role in European security , helping former adversaries enter into formal working relationships with the alliance . He was a key figure in turning President Clinton ' s idea of building links to these nations into a successful initiative , known as &quot; Partnership for Peace. &quot; Despite Woerner ' s visible loss of strength and prolonged absences from his office at NATO headquarters here in recent months , the announcement of his death came as a shock . Only last month , he had informed ambassadors from the alliance ' s 16 member nations that he was recovering and planned to resume a normal schedule next month . His passing marks the first time that a NATO secretary_general has died in office , and it leaves the alliance without strong leadership at a time when its future is filled with question_marks , for many of the changes that Woerner helped initiate are only now being implemented . Until a successor is found , the alliance will be headed by Deputy Secretary_General Sergio Balanzino , an Italian career diplomat with virtually no experience in military affairs who arrived_at NATO only last January . Observers say Woerner ' s possible successors include Norway ' s Thorvald Stoltenberg , a former foreign_minister and currently U.N. peace mediator in the Balkans , and former Italian Prime_Minister Giuliano Amato . Tributes to Woerner followed quickly after the announcement that he had lost his fight with cancer . &quot; He was a true and loyal friend of the United States , &quot; Clinton said in a written statement . &quot; . . . Manfred Woerner ' s heroic leadership made an enduring contribution to democracy and security in Europe. &quot; U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali lauded Woerner ' s &quot; wisdom , integrity and humanity , &quot; while Chancellor Helmut Kohl called him &quot; a guardian of Western steadfastness at the time of the Cold War. &quot; Although he lacked the political stature and the easy humor of his immediate predecessor , Britain ' s Peter Carrington , Woerner relied_on an iron will , personal courage and an unwavering commitment to the transatlantic relationship to steer NATO through the swiftly changing currents of the immediate post-Cold War era . &quot; When I began , I wasn ' t even allowed to receive an ambassador from the Warsaw Pact , &quot; he once commented , referring to the Soviet-led alliance of Communist nations that opposed NATO for more_than four decades . From his office in the sprawling NATO headquarters here , he would witness the end of the Warsaw Pact and welcome not just the ambassadors but the leaders of pact nations . In early 1992 , he began a struggle against cancer of the intestine that gradually sapped his strength and radically curtailed an active lifestyle that had combined flying , sports and consistent 16-hour workdays . His handling of this illness reflected his personal courage . Although he had lost nearly 40 pounds and was suffering intense pain , twice this year , in February and April , he defied doctors ' orders and chaired important NATO meetings that committed the alliance to enforce certain U.N. resolutions in the former Yugoslav federation . &quot; I saw there was finally a chance to do something and not just talk , &quot; he later explained to an interviewer . &quot; What the effort did to me was immaterial. &quot; According to those who worked with him , Woerner viewed the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a chance for the alliance to prove it could play an active , constructive role in the post-Cold War era . He reportedly became first enraged , then deeply disappointed , at the United Nations ' reluctance to use NATO air_power to enforce weapons exclusion zones around the Bosnian capital , Sarajevo , and the eastern town of Gorazde . It was under his stewardship that NATO engaged in offensive military_action for the first time in its history when , on Feb . 28 , 1994 , alliance F-16s first challenged , then shot down four Serbian aircraft that had violated a U.N.-declared &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia . &quot; People will learn to respect NATO , &quot; Woerner said on the night of the attack . Although serious differences between NATO and U.N. commanders blunted the alliance ' s role in its first major mission outside a member country , Woerner is credited with keeping NATO ' s reputation and internal unity largely intact . &quot; He absolutely refused to let the alliance get bounced into that conflict until the individual governments were committed , &quot; the ambassador of one member nation said . But many argued that his greatest single achievement was to nurture the consensus among the alliance ' s 16 partners that allowed NATO to survive its own success -- the defeat of communism in Europe -- and remain a key stabilizing factor_in the less certain world of the 1990s . &quot; East or west , north or south , everyone in Europe is still convinced that NATO is the only military alliance of any importance , &quot; noted Jonathan Eyal , director of studies at the London-based Royal United Services Institute . &quot; And that ' s not a small feat. &quot; Woerner was born in the southwest German city of Stuttgart on Sept . 24 , 1934 . Although too young to fight in World_War_II , he experienced the war as a preteen , huddled in underground shelters during Allied bombings of Nazi Germany . As a young adult , he once thought_of going_into the clergy but instead studied law in Munich . He quickly became active in politics , joining the conservative Christian Democrats at age 22 . Woerner found work as a legal adviser to the legislature of his home state of Baden-Wurttemberg and eventually entered the federal Parliament at age 31 . Although he initially specialized in education policy , he soon became involved in defense matters . He earned his wings as a jet fighter_pilot in the mid-1960s and by the mid-1970s had become his party ' s main spokesman on defense matters . When the Christian Democrats toppled Chancellor Helmut Schmidt ' s center-left coalition and regained power in West Germany in late 1982 , Woerner was named defense minister in Kohl ' s first Cabinet . It was a job he held throughout the tumultuous demonstrations in Germany that accompanied the stationing of American medium-range nuclear missiles in the country . Woerner backed the missile deployment and later became a rare European backer of former President Ronald Reagan ' s controversial Strategic Defense Initiative -- positions that caused frequent street protests against him . But it was scandal , not protests , that nearly ended Woerner ' s political career . His decision in late 1983 to summarily dismiss one of the armed forces ' most senior generals , Guenter Kiessling , amid accusations that he had frequented gay bars backfired when the charges proved false . Woerner had brushed_aside the general ' s strenuous rejection of the accusations and sacked Kiessling , claiming he was a security risk . Woerner survived only because Kohl refused to bow to public calls_for his resignation . Years later , East_German secret_police records were found suggesting that the allegations may have been planted by the Communists in hopes of undermining the hard-line defense minister . Woerner relished his image as an unbending hawk and ardent cold warrior -- an image he gained mainly when he became a prime target of his country ' s powerful peace movement in the 1980s . Once at NATO , however , he became an effective consensus builder , constantly searching for the middle ground needed to keep the alliance together , yet still moving it forward . &quot; I think he was a great secretary_general , &quot; Eyal said . &quot; He was one of the first to grasp the alliance needed to change , but knew that if he pushed too hard , too quickly , it could all break apart. &quot; While the alliance ' s structure changed considerably during Woerner ' s years at the helm , there was much he failed to alter . Although he liked to joke that his weight loss made him &quot; leaner and meaner &quot; -- much like the new NATO -- he never really managed to get_rid_of the organization ' s unwieldy central bureaucracy despite sharp post-Cold War defense cuts among member nations . He was also unable to persuade the alliance ' s 16 member nations to coordinate their military cutbacks to maintain the maximum possible strength . Instead , each reduced its forces according to its individual needs . Still , until the end , he remained a tough , respected leader of the alliance . After a recalcitrant Russian ambassador kept a meeting of NATO and its eastern partners bogged down this June for hours in petty debate during one of the long spells when Woerner was hospitalized , one frustrated alliance representative emerged from the room and muttered , &quot; Woerner never would have let him ( the Russian ) get_away with this. &quot;</TEXT>
