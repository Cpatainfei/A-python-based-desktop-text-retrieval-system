   <HEADLINE> COUNTY TO CUT RETIREES ' PAY_UP TO $ 280 MONTHLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County officials agreed Friday to cut as much as $ 280 a month from retirees ' pay next year , rather than dip_into reserve_funds or county coffers for the needed funds . Faced with tight financial markets and real_estate losses in the pension_fund , the county Board of Retirement voted 7 to 2 to eliminate the extra pay in the budget year beginning this July . &quot; We don ' t have the money , that ' s what it comes_down to , &quot; said Harold S . Pittman , the county tax_collector and a member of the board . County officials argued that granting the $ 5 million in supplemental benefits could force current employees to contribute more toward their retirement or prompt the county to cut jobs and salaries . Retirees rejected that argument , saying the pension_fund has more_than $ 42 million -- or 5 % of its resources -- in reserves that could be tapped . State law only requires that 1 % be set_aside . Retirees and current workers both supported a plan to reduce the reserve_fund to 4 % , providing as much as $ 8 million to pay the supplement benefits . &quot; The fund is extremely healthy , there is no reason this could not be approved by your board , &quot; said Catherine Johnston of the Ventura County Retired Employers Assn . * Johnston argued that the pension_plan can afford the reduction better than the retirees . &quot; To eliminate those benefits is going_to create a tremendous hardship on those retirees , &quot; she said . &quot; They have come_to depend_on these benefits for living expenses. &quot; Board_member Chuck Moore , who favored continuing the benefits , presented an actuary ' s analysis indicating that one year ' s payment would not affect the interest_rates or require higher employee contribution rates . Current county employees said the board should be able to find a way to provide the benefits without raising costs for workers or cutting_into retirees ' pay . &quot; I don ' t care how we do_it , whether we lower the reserves or whether the county steps_up to the plate , &quot; said Barry Hammitt , executive_director of the Service Employees International Union , Local 998 . But taxpayer advocates argued that reducing reserves for a onetime payment represents bad financial planning . The benefits at_issue come as supplement pay , funds beyond the pension that county retirees are already due . The retirement board granted one supplement benefit in 1977 , giving_up to $ 70 a month to pensioners . * The second benefit , approved in 1990 , applies only to employees who retired before that year . That payment , which can climb as high as $ 210 a month , was intended to make_up partly for policy_changes that gave the newest retirees significantly higher pension payments . But the benefits were intended to use_up excess funds in the profitable years , argued Supervisor Maria VanderKolk , who is also a member of the retirement board . &quot; In this past year , we don ' t have excess earning , and that ' s the crux of this , &quot; she said . Drops_in the stock_market have reduced the value of the county ' s fund , and real_estate losses have also affected the value . &quot; A public retirement_plan is not a social program intended to provide supplemental benefit as time and circumstances change , &quot; VanderKolk wrote in a letter to the other supervisors . Retirees say there is little solace to the pensioners , some of whom rely_on the supplemental benefits for 38 % of their pay . &quot; We still come_to the bottom-line problem . We ' re taking money out of people ' s pockets who have come_to rely_on it , &quot; said Hammitt from the employees union . He urged the board to find a permanent way to fund the supplemental benefits . Board_members and retiree representatives agreed to work toward that aim in the year ahead . Retirees will receive a letter within a_few weeks telling them not to expect the supplemental pay .</TEXT>
