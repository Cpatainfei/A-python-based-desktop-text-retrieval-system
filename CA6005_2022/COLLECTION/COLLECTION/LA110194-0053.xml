   <TEXT> This community of 23 # 000 was a Communist poster-town during the East_German years : an adequate if dreary-looking settlement built_up around a single huge truck factory , a place where most people enjoyed cradle-to-grave security in drab , prefabricated cement apartment blocks thrown_up by the state . Today , life is far more uncertain and also far more exciting . Over the past five years , Ludwigsfelde , less than an hour ' s drive south of Berlin , has ridden a roller_coaster of hopes and disappointments . Consider the way that the past five years have turned_out for Klaus Perlet and Reinhold Schulz , both former truck mechanics in Ludwigsfelde . Perlet , for his part , has the luxury of contemplating his transformation from socialist worker-bee to entrepreneur in the comfort and style of the skylighted head office of the metal-working firm he has owned since 1992 . &quot; I have fun , &quot; says the heavyset Perlet , sitting amid a potted-plant decor and blueprints spread across his drafting table . &quot; I love the feeling of making my own decisions , of finding the way for this little business . But I have two souls in my chest . One of them is the soul of a proprietor , who has to find a place in a very competitive market . The other is just the soul of a human_being , trying to work with others . These two souls can ' t always be reconciled. &quot; Meanwhile , across town , just off the parking_lot that passes for Ludwigsfelde ' s town square , Schulz is taking_advantage of the last lingering rays of autumn sunshine to drink a little beer outdoors and watch the world go_by . For Schulz , there is no point in soul-searching these days about free markets and the human condition ; there is barely any point in getting_out of bed in the morning . The end of East_German communism has spelled for him not opportunity , but a chain_reaction that started with the loss of his good factory job and ended_up with life in a flophouse . &quot; I lived better before than I do now , &quot; says Schulz , who was rescued from the street by a fellow jobless man , Werner Nowark , and brought_home to the unheated , unlighted apartment the two now share . Schulz lost his old flat when the owner renovated the building and raised the rent ; the so-called guest house where he was subsequently accommodated was torn_down , and in the confusion that marked eastern Germany in the early 1990s , he never managed to find another place of_his_own . &quot; Sure , I couldn ' t ever get bananas in East_Germany , and the coffee cost more , &quot; Schulz says . &quot; A color_TV set cost a fortune . But I had work . I could wake_up in the morning and look_forward to the day . I had something to be happy about . Now I wake_up and I say to myself , ' What do I do with myself today ? ' &quot; They are extremes , perhaps , the two mechanics : one who commands a staff of nine and the other approaching a state of utter dereliction . Yet the picture of eastern Germany five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall includes many examples of extreme adaptation and failure , and a whole spectrum of people in between : rising go-getters who drive cars with radio phones_plugged into the dashboard , embittered 50-year-olds who will never work again , frightened elderly on scanty state pensions and tough Rosie-the-Riveter types who now stay home unwillingly with small children . A look_around eastern Germany today turns_up any number of Ludwigsfeldes , places where East_German economic planners once decided to found single industries -- electronics , perhaps , or steel-milling -- and where the local economies collapsed when communism failed and steady Eastern Bloc markets dried_up . Ludwigsfelde is better_off today than many of these central-planning outposts . Its new , post-Communist administrators have managed to court a handsome number of private investments -- altogether , $ 510 million worth of new business through 1993 -- and to put a respectable percentage of the able-bodied adult population back to work . It has a dynamic mayor , Heinrich Scholl , a former circus executive and a free thinker who chafed under East German-style communism . He has worked with relish since the regime ' s collapse to fulfill capitalism ' s textbook promise . But most people in Ludwigsfelde are conscious of the five years of ceaseless struggle endured just to bring their community this far , and of how much further they still have to go before life ever feels secure again . The overall unemployment_rate here is about 10 % , significantly lower than in the rest of eastern Germany , but the figure is kept_down artificially by make-work schemes . A depressing 65 % of the jobless are skilled women . Some people have simply given_up on the town : Hundreds have moved away since 1989 . An estimated 10 % to 15 % of the townspeople still support the former Communist_Party , reorganized and renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism . Others take_out their frustrations by engaging in violence against foreigners and vagrants . &quot; I would call the mood in this city right now one of repressed optimism , &quot; said Gerhard Birk , a longtime Ludwigsfelde resident who now works as an archivist for the state_government . &quot; The place is changing now from a simple factory settlement to a town in its own_right , with its own typical flair . The direction is upward , but we are moving very gradually. &quot; &quot; I feel satisfied when I bump_into people I knew in the old days who are working again now , &quot; added Karl-Heinz Reifenberger , a former East_German accountant who is now charged with privatizing what ' s left of the former truck works . &quot; But , when I walk by the old production halls that are still standing empty , I feel frustrated and bitter. &quot; Ludwigsfelde traces its origins to 1750 , but it really came_into its own as a town in 1936 , when Daimler-Benz and Adolf Hitler ' s aviation ministry chose it as the site of a vast , strategically decisive fighter-aircraft factory . The town boomed as Daimler recruited young workers from across Germany and set them to work building warplanes . After universal conscription was imposed , Daimler kept the factory going_with forced labor from concentration_camps and with POWs . In 1945 , the advancing Red Army captured Ludwigsfelde , dismantled the aircraft factory and carted the hardware back as war reparations . When the German Democratic Republic opened for business in 1949 , the new government faced a problem : Ludwigsfelde had a population of skilled industrial artisans and no work for them to do . So the central planners brought_in industry : first , a state-owned aircraft-engine factory , and later , after the prototype aircraft crashed , a huge truck factory called IFA Automobilwerk Ludwigsfelde . Within East_Germany ' s planned economy , IFA emerged as a model factory , and Ludwigsfelde again thrived as a model town . Most of IFA ' s output was exported throughout the Eastern Bloc and the Third_World , although East_Germany had plenty of farm produce to get_to market , so there was a big domestic demand too . By the time the Berlin Wall came_down , nearly 10 # 000 people were punching the clock_on IFA ' s sprawling , 540-acre grounds . Schulz recalls that as a skilled mechanic he made 1 # 100 eastmarks per month -- in an economy where a standard apartment rented for 40 eastmarks per month . Factory management and the government , tightly intertwined , saw to all_the bedrock wants of the townspeople . IFA administered the local_government , distributed heat , water and power , ran a hotel , operated most of the local day-care centers and even provided all-important wurst out of its own butcher_shop . As long as you didn ' t step_out of line , life here was comfortable -- so_much so that the unrest that swept the larger East_German cities in 1989 never really touched Ludwigsfelde . &quot; I got the feeling that the Wende ( the Great Change ) was happening someplace else , and not in Ludwigsfelde , &quot; says Ute Schmidt , a former teacher who is now Ludwigsfelde ' s equal rights commissioner . Even when the East_German regime collapsed before their eyes , she says , people in Ludwigsfelde innocently assumed that not much trouble would come their way because of the changes . &quot; People said , ' Now we can travel , ' or ' now we ' ll need hard currency , ' but it didn ' t occur to them that their individual lives would be affected , &quot; she says . &quot; Nobody was talking_about the danger of losing a job , or not being able to find an apartment . It just wasn ' t a topic. &quot; Even when orders stopped coming_into the truck factory , when production ground to a standstill and word went_out that entire departments might have to be closed , people still did not grasp quite what was happening . Some people -- women , in particular , says Schmidt -- grabbed at their pink_slips greedily , delighted at the chance for some time_off and assuming in their innocence that they would always be able to find work later . Unemployment in East_Germany had been unknown . &quot; At that time , women had no idea what it really meant to stay home , &quot; says Schmidt , pointing_out that virtually 100 % of Ludwigsfelde ' s working-age women had factory jobs and sent their children to day_care . &quot; They didn ' t know how hard it would be to come_back later . . . . When I look_back now , I think that our mistake was having started from the assumption that we would improve upon what we had ( under communism ) . It didn ' t occur to us that we should have been defending our position. &quot; The blissful optimism was nurtured , in particular , by Daimler-Benz , which suddenly returned to Ludwigsfelde , seeking the return of its old_World War II factory site . The land claim failed -- the expropriation was deemed a valid and irreversible sanction for Daimler ' s wartime use of forced labor -- but then Daimler ' s flagship subsidiary , Mercedes-Benz , announced that it would come_to Ludwigsfelde just the same , buying a separate tract of land and building Europe ' s biggest truck factory from the ground up , with jobs for 4 # 000 of IFA ' s former work_force . &quot; People just assumed Mercedes-Benz would come and save their lives , &quot; Schmidt remembers . &quot; They didn ' t realize Mercedes would come only on the condition that it could make a profit. &quot; And as it turned_out , Mercedes came_to the conclusion that it could not make a profit on trucks here -- not , at least , in a new factory . In the end , it bought_out just a portion of the old IFA works and has hired only about 1 # 400 people . &quot; When the big Mercedes-Benz project burst like a balloon , it triggered a wave of disappointment and a wave of outward migration , &quot; says Birk , the archivist . Finally , reality sank_in : Capitalism would not be an uncomplicated good for Ludwigsfelde . Hand in_hand with the federal_government , people such_as Reifenberger , the privatization officer , began the slow , frustrating work of selling_off piecemeal the factory that had once treated them so protectively . Skilled_workers , such_as Schulz , began to understand that they might never hold regular jobs again . Schmidt says she began receiving a stream of women in her office , former forklift drivers or metal stampers , complaining that they were going_out of their minds at_home . &quot; Never , ever again will we have as_many working women as in the German Democratic Republic , &quot; she says . &quot; And never again will we have working conditions that are so fair for women. &quot; Still , Reifenberger , whose official title is the baleful-sounding Representative of the Liquidator , has managed to attract more_than a dozen West German investors to the old factory grounds . They produce everything from aircraft turbines to armored cars . These new investors employ about 3 # 800 of the 10 # 000 who used to work here . But even as it registers the entrepreneurial successes of such native sons as Klaus Perlet , Ludwigsfelde must come_to terms with the_likes_of Reinhold Schulz , who spends his days gathering firewood for the stove and his nights warding_off neo-Nazi street toughs . About two years ago , he reports , skinheads in the town set a 65-year-old acquaintance on_fire ; the man later died in the hospital . Hooligans have smashed all_the windows in Schulz ' s apartment . Skinhead violence has flared in the east since German unification , but until about 1993 , it was generally directed at foreigners who were perceived as stealing jobs from Germans . Now that there are stringent restrictions on who may enter Germany , the number of attacks has fallen_off somewhat , but the target group has broadened to include anyone the attackers see as weaker than they : tramps , beggars , slum dwellers and other unfortunates . Schulz ' s story , sad as it is , is doubly shocking in a society where vagrants and bag_ladies were until recently unknown . &quot; I never go_out by myself , and I walk only on well-lit streets , &quot; Schulz says . &quot; If I could afford a gun , I would shoot the next person who hassles me . I don ' t want to get set_on_fire , like my friend. &quot; &quot; I ' m no longer afraid of brutality from the state , &quot; says local Pastor Bernd Schewe . &quot; Now , I ' m afraid of the violence directed from one individual against another . We didn ' t have that in East_Germany . You could walk in the street at midnight and nothing would happen to you . A woman could go_into the forest alone and collect mushrooms . All this is gone now. &quot;</TEXT>
