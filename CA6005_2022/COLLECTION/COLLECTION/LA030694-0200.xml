   <HEADLINE> STATE OF THE UNION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Preparations for the beach wedding had already begun when Kay Wiker and Daniel Holmes got the bad news from the county of Orange : Weddings aren ' t permitted on county beaches . Wiker had known what elements he wanted at his wedding even before he fully realized , at the age of 18 , that he is gay . He wanted a ceremony on the sand and under a full_moon . His fiance , Holmes , was determined that the orchid-covered bamboo wedding arch , illuminated by candles held by each of the 150 guests and 100 tiki torches , would be part of the ceremony at Laguna ' s West Street beach . Then , in a twist both sweet and bitter to the participants , the county allowed the event to go_on as planned . The event , it seems , would be just a party -- not a wedding -- in the eyes of county officials , because the state doesn ' t recognize gay unions as legal marriages . So on June 4 , 1993 , Wiker , 33 , and Holmes , 27 , exchanged rings while seven attendants stood_by on the sand . Amid live cello and flute music , two ministers read prayers and watched as the San Juan Capistrano couple , in formal attire , recited their vows . It was a ceremony that Wiker , aware of the apparent irony of the term , described as old-fashioned . &quot; It was what I ' ve always wanted to do . I wanted to show Daniel how much I ' m willing to make a commitment to him , and do_it in front of our friends , &quot; he said . &quot; My straight friends are impressed that we did_it so openly . But there shouldn ' t be anything unusual in it . When two gay people want to show their commitment , they should be able to do so. &quot; Commitment ceremonies have increased steadily in recent years , gay-rights advocates say , and are helping to fuel litigation efforts to gain state recognition of same-sex unions . Recognition could come first in Hawaii , where gay-rights lawyers are confident of victory in a lawsuit that challenges state policies banning marriage_licenses for gay and lesbian couples . Such an outcome could put a national focus_on the issue if gays go_to Hawaii to marry and then return to their home states . &quot; If one state ultimately allows lesbian and gay marriages , there will be haggling in each state as_to whether or not to recognize those marriages , &quot; said Rachel Bernstein , a lawyer with the National Center for Lesbian Rights . &quot; And there may be cases just like there were with interracial marriages , &quot; when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled_in 1967 that Virginia had to recognize the union of an interracial couple who had gotten_married in another state . Lawsuits seeking to force states to recognize gay unions have become a priority among many gay-rights lawyers . Legal actions are pending in Florida , Arizona and the District_of_Columbia , and last year the marriage policy in California was unsuccessfully challenged by two West Hollywood men who sued after the Los Angeles County clerk denied their application for a marriage_license . The Hawaii suit may fare best because that state ' s constitution was amended specifically to prohibit government discrimination based on sex , said Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , which has brought the suit . In its defense , the state of Hawaii argues that children are_best raised by their biological parents , that the state has a compelling interest in fostering procreation , and that allowing same-sex couples to marry would convey state approval of non-heterosexual orientation and behavior . A final_decision is expected in a year or two . New Mexico and New Jersey may also soon be targeted for marriage-license suits because those states ' constitutions and case_laws show potential for being challenged , said J Craig Fong of the Lambda fund . Although no state recognizes gay unions , five California counties and several cities do . Los Angeles , West Hollywood and Laguna Beach are among eight municipalities that offer varying degrees of recognition of same-sex unions . A pending California Assembly bill that would allow gay couples to register their relationships is modeled after the policies of these cities . Under the measure , which was introduced on Valentine ' s Day , gays would be able to will property to their partners , participate in family-only hospital visits and gain conservatorship rights in the event one becomes incapacitated . Similar legislation was introduced in Hawaii last month . Gay-rights activists are optimistic about the California bill ' s chances but expect opposition , even though they say the measure , introduced by Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , falls far short of the benefits offered by marriage_licenses . &quot; Quite frankly , these are limited rights , the barest sort of protection , &quot; said Richard Jennings , executive_director of Hollywood Supports , a group that addresses HIV and gay issues in the entertainment_industry . &quot; The bill doesn ' t put gays on a par with married_couples . Gays continue to have relationships , buy property together and look_into the possibility of adopting children , but laws are not set_up to address any of these. &quot; Although gay partners sometimes have lawyers draft contracts and agreements that attempt to duplicate marriage benefits , it is estimated that such agreements can address only 60 % of what is covered in a heterosexual marriage . For example , the agreements cannot guarantee the same protections in areas such_as child custody , pension_plans , health coverage and Social_Security benefits . Also , gay-rights activists say that when gays seek court-ordered enforcement of the documents , some judges have refused to recognize them . Some commitment ceremonies announce the start of a relationship ; most affirm partnerships that began years or even decades earlier . The ceremonies can also be political statements , as when more_than 1 # 000 same-sex couples were simultaneously wed during last April ' s march_on Washington . But most of the ceremonies -- known variously as same-sex covenants , relationship rituals or holy unions -- are private parties held_in homes , hotels and churches . At Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood , Rabbi Denise L . Eger has performed hundreds of commitment ceremonies since 1988 . She says the rituals often serve as a welcome vehicle for hesitant parents to show their support of their gay children ' s relationships . Because no official records are kept , the national total of gay households is unknown . But the American Bar Assn. ' s Family Law Conference has estimated that at least 8 million children are being raised in 3 million same-sex households nationwide . Nearly all states permit adoption for same-sex couples . The notion of gay relationships remains discomforting to many people -- even to some who don ' t consider themselves anti-homosexual . The Los Angeles Diocese of the Episcopal Church debated at its recent convention whether the blessing of same-sex relationships should be sanctioned . After six hours of discussion , delegates failed to reach agreement . &quot; The idea of two women or two men marrying is one that I don ' t see myself theologically able to endorse or accommodate , &quot; said the Rev . David Anderson of St . James ' Episcopal Church in Newport Beach , whose delegation opposed the same-sex resolution . &quot; The term marriage has referred to a unique bond between a man and a woman , and the old medieval idea of marriage had to do with the production of children. &quot; Episcopal priests who had previously blessed same-sex covenants , such_as the Rev . George Regas at All Saints in Pasadena , continue to do so , and backers of the proposal say they will press the issue at the church ' s general convention this summer . Carl Tuttle , pastor of Vineyard Christian Fellowship in Anaheim , says he sees homosexuality as a sin but dislikes being lumped together with &quot; angry , hateful and militant &quot; opponents of gay rights . &quot; We don ' t condemn gays that way , &quot; Tuttle said . &quot; But I would n ' t have the faith to ( perform ) a gay marriage , because I do believe it ' s not within God ' s will . We see it as a sin , and they don ' t . We don ' t condone homosexuality for the same reason we don ' t condone drunkenness , theft or encourage divorce. &quot; But liberal clerics such_as Regas believe that gays should have a welcome home_in the church . &quot; The love of God revealed in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures is an inclusive love . that ' s the predominant theme of biblical literature , &quot; he said . Most Christian commitment ceremonies for same-sex couples are performed by the Metropolitan Community Church , founded in 1968 for gays who feel uncomfortable in other churches . The church has more_than 300 congregations worldwide . The Rev . Jane Carl , co-pastor of Ocean of Life MCC in Costa Mesa , has performed about 50 same-sex ceremonies . Like heterosexual candidates for marriage , gay partners meet at least three times with Carl before the ceremony to discuss the emotional , spiritual and legal aspects of their union . Carl requires couples to have lived together for at least one year before the ceremony . The specter of AIDS , she says , has played a role in encouraging long-term gay unions , especially among men . &quot; Gay_men are becoming much more monogamous in the face of AIDS , &quot; she said . Of the ceremonies that Carl has conducted , 70 % have been between women . At Congregation Kol Ami , just as_many gay_men as lesbians take vows , a change from the late 1980s , Eger said . She attributes the change to a renewal of the values of commitment in the gay male community , prompted by the AIDS crisis . Carl estimates that nationally , three of every five commitment ceremonies are non-religious . &quot; The reason , I think , is that the church has done so_much damage to gay and lesbian people spiritually that many are totally convinced that God will have no part of them . So they say , why do the ceremony in a church ? &quot; Chris and Micki Clark of Orange County are among the lesbian couples who chose to include Christian passages in their ceremony . The two met through a gay dating service last March and tied the knot two months later . &quot; It was love at first sight , &quot; said Chris , 31 , a state employee . &quot; We believe_in God , and I wanted to have my lifelong partner marry me because it ' s more of a commitment , more bonding . It ' s not only a religious but a social bond when you ' re out there in front of your friends and family. &quot; The guest list , which grew from 20 to 42 as more friends and co-workers began to show interest in attending , included &quot; gay , straight , old and young , &quot; said Micki , 27 , an administrative assistant . The couple ' s parents , however , didn ' t attend the ceremony . Micki said her parents &quot; would rather see us married to guys , but that ' s their opinion . Gay people have the right to be married , too . We ' re in love. &quot; Micki legally changed her last_name to match Chris ' . Of the gay couples who are wed at Kol Ami , about 20 % have parents who boycott the ceremony on principle , Eger says . Twenty-five_percent of the parents , she adds , are hesitant but find that the ceremony is a way to heal their relationship with their children . &quot; Say the parents are not dealing well with their child ' s sexual orientation , &quot; Eger said . &quot; Then they get a call from the child announcing the ceremony . The parents resist at first but know they have to do the right thing and show_up . And it has a positive effect . A wedding is a wedding . There ' s music and loving words said. &quot; While the courts are deciding whether the definitions of marriage should be expanded , increasing numbers of private companies are rewriting their benefits policies to include non-traditional couples . Some began by offering health and other benefits to the unmarried partners of heterosexual employees and then extended the benefit to the partners of gay and lesbian employees . When former Apple Computer Chairman John Sculley initiated a benefits program for domestic partners last year , his rationale was as American as capitalism , said company spokesman Frank O ' Mahony . &quot; He was concerned that we could have a potential disadvantage recruiting the best talent if gay people knew they couldn ' t get adequate health benefits , &quot; O ' Mahony said . Sculley ' s competitive pragmatism , the spokesman added , was accompanied by a personal belief that denying benefits to committed gay couples is simply unfair . Other companies and institutions offering domestic-partnership benefits include Levi Strauss , Ben &amp; Jerry ' s Ice_Cream and Stanford_University . The entertainment_industry is also steadily recognizing the rights of gay partnerships , said Jennings of Hollywood Supports , who has helped draft policies adopted by MCA / Universal , Warner Bros. , Viacom , HBO and the Los Angeles Philharmonic . Such benefits , however , may_not be as lucrative as they seem , according to the Partners Task_Force for Gay and Lesbian Couples , an advocacy group based in Seattle . The Internal Revenue Service calculates the dollar value of domestic-partnership benefits and adds that to the working partner ' s income , the task_force said . Gay-rights advocates say the fact that gay unions generally lack job benefits and state recognition is proof that the ceremonies are reflections of love rather than arrangements of convenience . &quot; We ' re doing this in spite of the fact that there ' s no legal or economic benefit , &quot; said Eger , who has been wed four years to her lesbian partner . &quot; Even though we ' re discriminated against by the state from building stable , normative lives , I have people who have been together 18 , 20 , 24 years . I find it ironic that the radical right wants to paint the gay community as promiscuous , evildoing and predatory when the reality is ( that ) gay- and lesbian-commitment ceremonies are really about celebrating gay and lesbian stability. &quot; Eger concedes , however , that breakups among gay partners occur nearly as frequently as they do_in heterosexual marriages . In such cases , she encourages gay as well as straight couples to undergo what she calls &quot; a sacred ceremony of dissolutionment. &quot; &quot; I do create ceremonies of closure and separation , &quot; Eger said . &quot; In ( prenuptial ) counseling we talk_of what happens when the relationship doesn ' t work. &quot; Daniel Holmes said his relationship has become stronger since he was wed on the moonlit beach . &quot; We ' d both had previous long-term relationships , and in this one , there ' s not that thought that one of us could walk_out the door . This is the most settled and loving time I ' ve had in my life. &quot;</TEXT>
