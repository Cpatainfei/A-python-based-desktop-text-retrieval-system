   <HEADLINE> ITALIAN PREMIER QUITS ; HE HELD POST FOR 7 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italy ' s besieged and embittered Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Thursday bowed_out of a riches-to-political-rags government that was born with bold promises but died in internal dissension after seven frustrating months . On a gray afternoon , Berlusconi rode through Christmas traffic up Rome ' s Quirinale hill in his bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz to tender his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro . &quot; I feel lighter . I have gotten_rid_of a great weight , &quot; Berlusconi told reporters when he emerged from the 45-minute meeting in the Renaissance Quirinale Palace that has been home to popes and presidents . Berlusconi , a 58-year-old media tycoon , entered politics in January , promising a new_deal for Italy after decades of political cronyism underwritten by endemic corruption . But the prime_minister himself became a target of prosecutors , who alleged that , before he entered politics , bribes were paid to tax inspectors at his Fininvest media and retail company . Berlusconi denies that he knew about them . Then , last week , Berlusconi ' s coalition partner , Umberto Bossi , leader of the populist Northern League , broke_with him and joined the opposition in three no-confidence motions . Berlusconi quit to preempt an embarrassing defeat in a parliamentary vote . The collapse of the nation ' s 53rd postwar government foreshadows a period of political uncertainty . Both the lira and the stock_market have fallen_in recent weeks as Berlusconi ' s right-wing coalition teetered and finally toppled like a dried-out Christmas_tree . Scalfaro , a former member of the long-ruling but now discredited Christian Democrat party , asked Berlusconi to stay_on as caretaker until a decision is made to form a new government or call elections . Today Scalfaro begins a round of consultations with political_leaders that will end -- probably after Christmas -- in one of three ways : He will ask Berlusconi to form a new government , give the task to someone else or call new elections . Scalfaro is believed to think a new government could be formed within the existing Parliament , which was elected nine months ago . Berlusconi and his neo-fascist allies , the National Alliance , favor new elections . &quot; I asked President Scalfaro to call elections as soon as possible , and I also suggested a date , &quot; Berlusconi told reporters Thursday . Starting Wednesday afternoon , Italians had followed live television transmission of the proceedings as government deputies in Parliament heatedly traded charges with their erstwhile allies and the opposition . The debate broke_off abruptly Thursday morning after an impromptu Cabinet meeting , when Berlusconi announced that he intended to throw_in_the_towel . Berlusconi ' s coalition -- three right-wing parties , headed by his Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) -- had been under constant pressure since it was installed in May to resolve a huge public_debt problem , to complete continuing political corruption probes and to meet demands that Berlusconi divest his business holdings . Bossi was an outspoken critic of Berlusconi on these issues . Early this month , a 2 1 / 2-year-old corruption inquiry by magistrates in Milan closed_in on Fininvest . Pressing their investigation of payoffs to politicians by business people and industrialists in return for government contracts , they interrogated Berlusconi . The prime_minister loudly protested his innocence , and his lawyers have demanded that the case be shelved . But as Berlusconi resigned Thursday , news came that his brother Paolo , who heads the Fininvest publishing enterprises , was given a seven-month suspended sentence for paying $ 90 # 000 in bribes to the corruption-tainted Christian Democrat party . Italy ' s latest government was hailed last spring as one that would give national politics a fresh_start with new faces and new parties , but it crumbled in much the same way as its predecessors had . Berlusconi entered politics in a successful effort to short-circuit a victory by the left , led by the former Communist_Party . He won the March elections with promises of a freer market , lower taxes , open government and a corruption-free political_system . But his government was forced to its knees partly by the same political squabbling , unpopular budgets and suspicions of corruption that were the hallmark of previous governments . * During the parliamentary debate , which Berlusconi himself called , the beleaguered premier attacked Bossi , accusing him of treachery against the government and voters . &quot; After being elected with the votes of the Forza Italia voters he has . . . betrayed them , &quot; he cried angrily in a 25-minute speech . He termed Bossi ' s no-confidence motion &quot; a slap in the face &quot; and &quot; a resounding offense to good_sense and to the citizens ' trust. &quot; Bossi , for his part , accused the government of fulfilling none of its promises , which ranged from the creation of a_million new jobs , to the privatization of industry , to antitrust and conflict-of-interest laws that would have stripped Berlusconi of direct control over his television and publishing interests . Upon Berlusconi ' s resignation , the Northern League split after about two_dozen of their 100 or so members_of_Parliament , led by Interior Minister Roberto Maroni , decided to support Berlusconi . Times staff writer William D . Montalbano contributed to this report .</TEXT>
