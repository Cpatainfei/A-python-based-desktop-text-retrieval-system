   <HEADLINE> STANFORD GRAD ORTIZ : VETERAN OF FINANCIAL CRISES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In naming Guillermo Ortiz to be Mexico ' s finance_minister , President Ernesto Zedillo appointed a friend , former colleague and , like himself , a U.S.-trained economist . But most important , given Mexico ' s perilous economic state , he brought_on a respected international player . Ortiz , a native of Mexico_City and son of an Army general , earned a doctorate in economics from Stanford_University in 1977 . For the next seven years , he was an economist at Mexico ' s central_bank , where he met Zedillo and gained experience in crisis management , helping the Miguel de la Madrid administration with the delicate process of rescheduling Mexico ' s foreign debt . From 1984 to 1988 , Ortiz represented Mexico at the International Monetary Fund in Washington . By the time he left the IMF , he was executive_director and had built a global reputation -- while gathering the inside knowledge of the world financial community Zedillo is now counting_on . After leaving the IMF , Ortiz became the No . 2 man at the Mexican Finance Ministry under Pedro Aspe , another respected international player who was the architect of Mexico ' s return to fiscal respectability during the Salinas de Gortari administration . As a banking specialist , Ortiz oversaw the privatization of Mexico ' s 18 commercial_banks under Salinas and helped draft the banking chapter of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . In the course of his career , he has written two books and published numerous articles on international economic themes . The dismissal of Jaime Serra Puche as finance_minister had been expected this week amid mounting criticism of his handling of the peso devaluation . The seeds of that crisis were sown long before Serra Puche and Zedillo took_office Dec . 1 , however . Mexico ' s worsening trade imbalance and continued political unrest in Chiapas state , which unsettled foreign confidence , were factors beyond their control .</TEXT>
