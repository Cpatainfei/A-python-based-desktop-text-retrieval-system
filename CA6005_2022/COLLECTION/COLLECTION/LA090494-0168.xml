   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; HOLLYWOOD ' S MONSTER FALL ; REMEMBER WHEN THE SEASON AFTER SUMMER WAS A MOVIE DUMPING GROUND ? WELL , NOT THIS YEAR . NEARLY 60 FILMS ARE COMING_OUT BEFORE THE TRADITIONAL HOLIDAY CRUNCH . GROWN-UPS , REJOICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fall . The kids refill their loose-leaf binders . The leaves depart the old ash_tree . Sweaters and coats are pulled_out of the cedar_chest . So_much to do . Not much time to catch a new movie . Fortunately , Hollywood perennially puts some slack in its release schedule for the season as people get_back to their lives apres the deluge of summer movies . But not this year . Some of it has to do with films ' having been pulled from summer so they would n ' t be run_over by blockbuster express_trains : the Meryl Streep action / suspense movie &quot; The River Wild &quot; ; the Albert Brooks baseball comedy &quot; The Scout , &quot; and &quot; Only You , &quot; a romance between Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr . In other cases , the movies ' premises required more advance groundwork than can be packed into a 30-second high-concept TV commercial : &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; starring John Travolta and Bruce Willis ; &quot; Ed Wood &quot; with Johnny Depp , and &quot; Exit to Eden , &quot; featuring Dana Delany and Rosie O ' Donnell . These three self-described &quot; comedies &quot; deal with contract murder , transvestism and sadomasochism , respectively . The fall is also used to get a running jump_on the holiday season , when the major studios cram as_many movies as they can into a space no bigger than a phone_booth . This year , there ' ll be Paul Newman and Melanie Griffith starring in the drama &quot; Nobody ' s Fool , &quot; Kenneth Branagh returning to the Mary Shelley novel for his &quot; Frankenstein , &quot; and Tim Allen attempting a smooth TV-to-film ride in &quot; The Santa Clause. &quot; &quot; I ' m no fortune-teller , &quot; says 20th Century Fox distribution head Tom Sherak , &quot; but fall looks strong on product . It ' s not a dumping ground this year. &quot; Nor , says Touchstone Pictures President David Hoberman , will fall merely be the preserve of sophisticated fare with limited commercial potential . &quot; There are a number of films this year with great playability , &quot; he says . Playability means box-office appeal . With limited playing time and a smaller available audience than in summer or around Christmas , it ' s a challenge for a fall movie to build a substantial audience . Still , everybody hopes against hope for a &quot; Fatal Attraction &quot; or a &quot; ' Crocodile ' Dundee &quot; or an &quot; Under Siege &quot; -- fall releases that each grossed upward of $ 80 million . No baseball playoffs or World_Series this year could boost movie attendance too , some industry wags say . On the other hand , a real-life murder mystery will be playing_out on television . The O.J. Simpson trial will begin Sept . 19 and is expected to run_through December . &quot; If there ' s gavel-to-gavel coverage of the trial , it could have a major impact on the movie business , &quot; Universal Chairman Tom Pollock says . For struggling independent companies , fall is a time to snare some attention for themselves , although this year , says Samuel Goldwyn Co . production head John Manulis , the studios are crowding them as never before . And since the independents can ' t spend what studios do on ad_campaigns , they have to find other ways to call attention to their wares . One way is to get there first . Goldwyn is releasing David Mamet ' s controversial sexual_harassment drama &quot; Oleanna , &quot; two months before Warner Bros. ' adaptation of Michael Crichton ' s similarly themed &quot; Disclosure , &quot; which opens Dec . 16 . Renewed debate about the topic &quot; should stir_up the Internet , &quot; Manulis predicts . Also on the independents ' side is the fall film festival hoopla -- starting Labor_Day with the Telluride Festival and continuing at Toronto , Montreal and New York . &quot; It ' s a time when independent films get a lot of press attention , &quot; says October Films principal Jeff Lipsky . &quot; That makes_it easier for us to reach our core audience than for the major studios -- if we have cutting-edge films. &quot; And there ' s nothing like controversy to stoke audience interest . Two independently made fall movies have run_afoul of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America ratings board -- the romantic drama &quot; Jason ' s Lyric &quot; and the low-budget comedy &quot; Clerks &quot; -- over sexual content and language , respectively . Still , when all is said and done , one senior studio executive says , this fall season is likely to fit , more or less , into the pattern of years past : &quot; There ' ll be five movies that work and about 15 to 20 movies that break_even . All the rest will lose money. &quot; With nearly 60 movies due for release between Labor_Day and Nov . 11 ( Nov . 18 will see the release of such holiday films as &quot; Interview with the Vampire &quot; ) , that means about 30 flops . Small wonder that the principals involved in the major fall releases are working hard to distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack . &quot; We work hard to sell these movies . But word-of-mouth is the still most potent way , &quot; Paramount head Sherry Lansing says . Battle of the True Romances &quot; Warren Beatty and I have duked it out before , &quot; jokes director Norman Jewison , whose romantic comedy &quot; Only You &quot; is_due mid-October , around the same time as Beatty and Annette Bening ' s amorously inclined &quot; Love Affair. &quot; ( Jewison ' s &quot; In the Heat of the Night &quot; and Beatty ' s production of &quot; Bonnie and Clyde &quot; opened at_the_same_time in 1967. ) Whereas Beatty wonders whether an &quot; unabashedly romantic &quot; movie might be viewed a bit of a gamble in these hard-bitten times , Jewison is confident that romance is always in fashion and love always in bloom . &quot; Everyone told me that no one would come_to see ' Moonstruck , ' &quot; he says of the Cher / Nicolas Cage close encounter he directed several years ago . &quot; Love_Affair &quot; is the second remake of Leo McCarey ' s 1939 romantic drama starring Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer . McCarey himself remade it in 1957 as &quot; An Affair to Remember , &quot; with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr , one of the great weepies of all time . Beatty says the 1994 model hews closer to the original yet has a contemporary sensibility . A delicate juggling act . But , Beatty points_out , his &quot; Heaven Can Wait &quot; updated the 1941 comedy &quot; Here Comes Mr. Jordan &quot; without losing the original ' s emotional underpinnings . In &quot; Only You , &quot; Jewison may_not have the publicity value of a real-life famous married_couple playing lovers on screen , but he is pleased with the chemistry between Tomei and Downey . Down Memory Lane What do Woody Allen , George Lucas , Robert Redford and Kevin Costner have in common ? Going_into the past to create contemporary entertainments . Allen ' s &quot; Bullets Over Broadway &quot; is an out-and-out comedy about a ' 20s mobster who finances a Broadway show . It features a younger ensemble than usual for the Woodman -- including John Cusack , Mary-Louise Parker , Chazz Palmintieri and Jennifer Tilly . After a string of financial disappointments for Orion and TriStar , it ' s Allen ' s first film to be released by an independent company , Miramax . Producer Jean Doumanian is counting_on Miramax ' s TLC , which worked so well for &quot; The Piano &quot; and &quot; The Crying Game , &quot; to help Allen broaden his audience . &quot; Miramax cleverly takes movies that are not necessarily mainstream and sells them to a mainstream audience , &quot; Doumanian says . Producer George Lucas is also dabbling_in nostalgia with his first big-screen venture since the third &quot; Indiana Jones &quot; movie in 1989 . &quot; Radioland Murders , &quot; he says , combines the humor of Nick and Nora Charles , &quot; His Girl_Friday , &quot; the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges . Brian Benben of HBO ' s &quot; Dream On &quot; gets his first starring role in a film that Lucas promises has six murders , 16 musical numbers and more_than 100 speaking parts . &quot; It ' s a very active film , &quot; Lucas says . &quot; Lots of different things are happening all_the time . It starts_out as a murder-mystery and then the hero ' s on the run . I guess you could say it ' s a sequel to ' The Fugitive. ' &quot; Robert Redford has dipped_into the past in a more personal way . &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; which he directed , stars &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro in a film centering_on the 1958 &quot; Twenty-One &quot; TV game_show scandal . The moment has resonance for him , Redford says , because it marks the year he first arrived in New York at the age of 19 and became aware of the immense power of the new medium of television ; in fact , he got his first acting break on a TV quiz show . &quot; That event set something in motion , &quot; Redford says of the scandal . &quot; It provides a context to look_at ourselves today and why we ' re now in a place of moral ambiguity and cynicism. &quot; Director / producer Jon Avnet ( &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes &quot; ) returns to another pivotal moment in our history , 1970 , the height of the Vietnam_War , to tell the story over children ' s battle for a tree_house in Mississippi in &quot; The War. &quot; The title is a metaphor for violence from a child ' s ( Elijah Wood ) point_of_view . Avnet acknowledges that the comedy-drama will need strong word-of-mouth to draw audiences in . Fortunately , &quot; it has Costner &quot; as the boy ' s Vietnam vet father &quot; who teaches him what ' s worth fighting for. &quot; A star of Costner ' s magnitude , even in a supporting role , could bring attention to the film whose concept , like that of &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes &quot; &quot; doesn ' t exactly reach_out and grab people by the throat , &quot; Avnet says . In a League of Their Own Director Michael Ritchie was adamant in insisting that his &quot; The Scout , &quot; starring Albert Brooks and Brendan Fraser , is not a baseball movie . Since the start of the baseball strike , however , he ' s been telling people : &quot; It ' s the movie to see if you miss the national pastime. &quot; There are no big_games , he says , no villains , no underdogs in this movie based on a &quot; classic unproduced script &quot; by Andrew Bergman ( rewritten by Brooks and Monica Johnson ) about a down-and-out scout who discovers an idiosyncratic talent out_in the boonies . Ritchie says he ' s not worried about anti-baseball backlash affecting the movie ' s commercial chances . &quot; But you should call Albert and ask him if he ' s worried about opening against a Meryl Streep action picture , &quot; he said , referring to &quot; The River Wild. &quot; &quot; The Scout &quot; is straight down the middle compared to a curve_ball like &quot; Ed Wood. &quot; The plot -- which concerns a schlock-movie director ( Johnny Depp ) who is also a heterosexual transvestite -- is definitely not formulaic . Factor_in too that it was directed by Tim Burton , the man who won audiences over to a teen-ager with pruning shears for hands ( &quot; Edward Scissorhands &quot; ) . Producer Denise DiNovi calls &quot; Ed Wood &quot; &quot; the weirdest ' Rocky ' movie ever made. &quot; As with most Burton movies , DiNovi says , &quot; it ' s about an outsider who wants desperately to be accepted . &quot; It ' s a comedy , really , &quot; she adds . that ' s exactly how producer Lawrence Bender describes &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; the already widely praised new film from &quot; Reservoir Dogs &quot; director Quentin Tarantino . &quot; It ' s not a comedy like ' Naked Gun , ' &quot; Bender says , &quot; but you laugh a lot . It ' s an epic , bold movie. &quot; With a high body_count . The multistory roundelay of murder , slapstick and verbal idiosyncrasies features an ensemble cast that includes John Travolta , Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson . &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; has already won the Palme d ' Or at Cannes and will open the New York Film Festival in late September . Action Central The high-adrenaline crowd will have a chance to see Sylvester Stallone in a suit , Jean-Claude Van Damme in the future and Meryl Streep on a raft . Director Luis Llosa describes &quot; The Specialist &quot; as a thriller with action , a different kind of Stallone movie , one with a strong female character , played by Sharon Stone . Stallone ' s blood-and-guts fans will not be disappointed , he promises , but there will be characters who are developed , who have psychological dimensions . Van Damme ' s &quot; Timecop , &quot; about time travel , was originally set for summer . It got pushed to September , he says &quot; because Universal wasn ' t expecting this good a movie . So they held it. &quot; Streep comes_out swinging in &quot; The River Wild , &quot; in which her character must scale the rapids to save her family . &quot; It ' s not simply ' Meryl Streep as Bruce Willis , ' &quot; cautions director Curtis Hanson . Nor is it &quot; a woman ' s movie , &quot; he says , any more_than was his last suspense film , &quot; The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. &quot; &quot; Guys who are threatened by a strong woman might think_of it as a woman ' s movie , &quot; he says . &quot; I think women will appreciate a movie of this size and scope with a woman at the heart of it . Usually in this kind of story she ' d be in the background. &quot; Early Birds If you have the &quot; other &quot; period thriller and the &quot; other &quot; Santa Claus movie , it helps to get a bead on the competition . TriStar is opening &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein , &quot; which stars Robert De Niro and Kenneth Branagh ( who also directed ) , on Nov . 4 , well in_advance of this year ' s holiday releases , even though it is a prestige film that could have been expected to be opened over the holidays . One reason is to get a two-week jump_on &quot; Interview With the Vampire , &quot; the much talked-about screen version of Anne Rice ' s popular novel , starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt . &quot; I don ' t know the Anne Rice novel , &quot; Branagh says , &quot; but anybody would be interested in a Tom Cruise movie directed by Neil Jordan . Both are distinct , &quot; he says of the two movies , &quot; and I hope both will be seen. &quot; The perfect diplomatic answer . Branagh says that two years ' work_on the project has made him every bit as feverish about his creation as the character of Dr. Victor Frankenstein . He promises that De Niro ' s performance as the monster -- in which he reads from Goethe and Milton -- is &quot; terrifying , but he also breaks your heart . He will absolutely make people forget Boris Karloff. &quot; Tim Allen hopes to appear so at_home in &quot; The Santa Clause &quot; that people will forget it ' s his first starring role in a movie . It ' ll arrive right before the much more experienced John Hughes ( &quot; Home Alone &quot; ) delivers his Santa Claus production &quot; Miracle on 34th Street. &quot; But in addition to Kris Kringle , Allen ' s movie &quot; involves sleighs , kids , reindeer , elves and a smart-ass like me , &quot; he says . And if that ' s not enticement enough , he says : &quot; This is the movie the North_Pole doesn ' t want you to see. &quot; Whatever their relative merits , the fall releases will have to catch_on fast and stay red hot if they hope to compete once the holiday stampede begins . During the final six weeks of the year , there ' ll be a crush of big films . A partial list includes the aforementioned &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; and a new &quot; Star Trek &quot; entry called ' Star Trek : Generations. &quot; Family fare will include the &quot; Miracle on 34th Street , &quot; &quot; Jungle Book &quot; and &quot; Little Women &quot; remakes and a big-screen version of the comic_strip &quot; Richie Rich. &quot; There ' ll be biographies of Dorothy Parker ( &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle , &quot; starring Jennifer Jason Leigh ) and Ty Cobb ( &quot; Cobb , &quot; with Tommy Lee Jones ) . Robert Altman ' s ensemble comedy about fashion , &quot; Pret-a-Porter &quot; will debut . There ' ll also be romantic comedies such_as &quot; Speechless , &quot; with Michael Keaton and Geena Davis ; &quot; I.Q. , &quot; pairing Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins , and &quot; Lifesavers , &quot; featuring Steve Martin and Madeline Kahn . Arnold Schwarzenegger will give_birth to his comedy &quot; Junior. &quot; And Michael Douglas will be raked over the coals by Demi Moore in the drama &quot; Disclosure. &quot;</TEXT>
