   <HEADLINE> CHANGING LIFESTYLES ; LET THE DRIVER BEWARE ON ALBANIAN ROADS ; BANNED BY THE COMMUNISTS , PRIVATELY OWNED CARS ARE NOW THE ULTIMATE STATUS SYMBOLS . UNFORTUNATELY , FEW PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the poorest country in Europe , there sure are a lot of Mercedes-Benzes here . They glide down the dirt-encrusted streets , nosing aside donkey_carts and scattering pedestrians who leap for high ground like spry Albanian goats . It wasn ' t always so . Private cars were banned under the long , brutal , Stalinist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha , who shut his country off from the rest of the world and believed that all good Albanians should walk or take public_transport . For the lucky ones , there were also bicycles . It wasn ' t until 1991 , when Communist rule collapsed , that privately owned cars -- many of them dented and smoke-belching Benzes -- began appearing on Tirana ' s wide , tree-lined avenues . They since have become the ultimate consumer icon for an impoverished nation of 3.2 million people who are starved for Western goods . From only 5 # 300 cars in Communist times , the number of private cars soared to 120 # 000 by the end of 1993 , with thousands more imported each month , according to the Ministry of Public Order . And therein lies a problem . Roads built more_than 60 years ago are inadequate for today ' s traffic . Drivers lack basic skills . They speed recklessly along roads clogged with peasants , cows , carts , tractors and Russian-made Stalin trucks from the 1950s . Many drive without lights at night to spare their batteries . And pedestrians -- who grew_up on empty streets -- possess none of the survival instincts that are second nature to urban dwellers elsewhere . For many Albanians , this has proved fatal . In the first nine months of 1993 , there were 300 deaths because of auto accidents and 111 injuries , the Ministry of Public Order reported . It recorded 563 accidents , but that figure is believed to be low . The anarchy on_the_roads is an apt metaphor for Albania today , as two generations of totalitarian control and repression give_way to chaos . The disintegrating highway_system also creates a concrete impediment to trade and tourism . Conditions are so bad that many taxis refuse to use the steep coastal road , which offers breathtaking vistas of the unspoiled Adriatic coastline . At least two-thirds of the 85-mile-long Albanian road , which runs east-to-west from the Macedonian border to the Adriatic port of Durres , is potholed , narrow , mountainous or unpaved . Millions of dollars are needed to realize the first leg of a wider Balkan dream to rebuild the ancient Via Egnatia of the Roman_Empire , a corridor from the Adriatic to the Black_Sea . &quot; It ' s absolutely necessary that Albania put priority on reconstructing roads , &quot; said Nasi Lesku , director of the Albanian-American Trade Assn . &quot; They can ' t hope to get tourists or trade otherwise. &quot; After declining by 40 % to 50 % in 1991 and 1992 , the Albanian economy grew by 11 % in 1993 , the International Monetary Fund says . But at least 60 % of Albanians are unemployed . Most of the country ' s factories are abandoned steel skeletons . Running water is only a memory for most in Tirana , and power outages are common . Albania survives on international aid and the $ 350 million in remittance payments from its citizens working abroad . In such an environment , sliding inside a car and punching the accelerator offers Albanians a visceral surge of power , one that can be lethal to those in the way . &quot; We Albanians like big cars , luxury cars , &quot; says Rafael Feogi , who works for the Albanian Telegraphic Agency . &quot; But we have no habit of driving because there ' s no history of cars in Albania , and the streets are narrow . &quot; They ' re from the time of King Zog , &quot; Feogi adds , referring to the country ' s onetime monarch , who fled Albania in 1939 as the Italians marched into his country . Carmelo Campillo , a visiting Madrid businessman who carries plastic containers of gasoline in his sport utility vehicle because he never knows whether he will be able to find fuel , puts it more bluntly , saying : &quot; Albanians are the worst drivers in the world. &quot; It is common in all Albanian cities to see cars barreling the wrong way down one-ways , speeding along the sidewalk or literally cutting corners . In the countryside , farmers get_around on their government-provided tractors , which have no lights and chug along at 5 to 8 m.p.h. , says Lesku . To make matters worse , Tirana , a capital city of 300 # 000 , has only a dozen traffic_lights ; they are often on the blink because of sporadic power outages . A Western diplomat last fall explained that Tirana was safer than most U.S. cities because the occasional robbers rarely hurt people who surrender their wallets . &quot; However , there is another kind of Albanian who does pose a grave threat to your life and limb , &quot; the diplomat continued , &quot; and that is the Albanian behind the wheel of a car. &quot; Last fall , an Albanian secretary for the Peace Corps was hit and killed by a car as she stood on the sidewalk between the Tirana Hotel and the National Museum . An American lawyer doing consulting work for Albania ' s Ministry of Labor was run_over and killed by a motorcycle in Tirana last May . A clerical worker with the U.S. Information Office had her leg amputated at the hip last year after being hit by a car as she walked along the seafront in Sarande in southern Albania . By law , Albanians who want a license must prove they have graduated from driving school , which costs about $ 100 -- more_than twice the average monthly wage . Thirty-five such schools have sprung_up to meet the demand , and it is not unusual to see 50-year-old men squeezed into wheezing Fiats , hands gripped tightly around the wheel , attempting a tricky mountain curve as their instructor gesticulates wildly . But in a country where corruption is endemic , residents say it is equally common to bribe the school for a certificate of completion . Bribery is also a way_of_life on highways , where buses and cars are subjected_to an Albanian mordida from police_officers who set_up roadblocks and charge from $ 5 to $ 50 . Women drivers are still rare sights in this male-dominated society , where even those women who work go directly home when their shift ends . Today , Albanians in villages still gape when a Western vehicle whizzes by . Some line_up at the side of the road and wave . Sometimes , children beg or throw rocks . * The anger and awe revolve_around the knowledge that cars remain beyond the reach of most people , since the average Albanian makes about $ 29 per month , according to state statistics . Despite the grim realities of life today , a recent poll by Eurobarometer found that 46 % of Albanians believe that the economy has improved . The International Monetary Fund says there are now 50 # 000 private shops in Albania -- many tiny kiosks plunked_down on Tirana ' s sidewalks . The IMF and the World_Bank recently approved loans to Albania totaling $ 79 million . Albania ' s thriving merchant class -- including black marketeers -- shop_at Benetton ' s Tirana and carry cellular_phones into the fancy restaurants that are sprouting throughout the capital . They favor new Mercedes-Benzes and American-style four-wheel-drives . There is one Corvette in Tirana , famous for its New Jersey license_plates , and people drop what they are doing to watch the muscle car power down the dusty streets . Others must settle for more anonymous models , stolen in Western Europe and sold here for as little as $ 3 # 000 . Many more are dumped on the Albanian market because they do not meet strict emission standards enforced in the West . Albania even has its own Autogate scandal , in which government ministries were discovered to have spent more_than $ 1 million of credit from the World_Bank to buy cars for official institutions . Meanwhile , Albania struggles under a foreign debt of more_than $ 600 million .</TEXT>
