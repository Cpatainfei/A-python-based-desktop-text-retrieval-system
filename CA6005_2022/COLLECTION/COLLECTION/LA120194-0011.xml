   <TEXT> * State Sen . Tom Hayden ( &quot; The Special_Interests Still Rule , &quot; Column Left , Nov . 22 ) correctly states that &quot; democracy is being killed by advertising. &quot; The politicians with the most means to pollute the media with trite cliches and uncontested claims most often win out.This loads our government with lackeys beholden to the few who contribute the most . A common-sense solution is to limit the amount_of_money that can be spent on a campaign . Every politician , depending_on the office they are running_for , should be allowed to spend only so_much money . That way , it ' ll be a fair contest , and the ones who manage their resources best will most likely win , and in_effect put the best money managers in office . This simple idea makes so_much sense that there should be a groundswell of support . But don ' t expect Republican money to grease the public ' s ire on this one . No , this common-sense solution is one for the Democrats to run with . AL DaSILVA Los Angeles</TEXT>
