   <HEADLINE> PROSECUTORS WON ' T ACT AND JUDGE WON ' T BUDGE ; COURTS : U.S. ATTORNEY ' S OFFICE SAYS IT HAS NO CASE AGAINST A MAN WHO SAYS HE BROUGHT GUN INTO COURTHOUSE BY MISTAKE . BUT AN ANGRY JURIST HAS KEPT HIM IN JAIL SINCE OCT . 4 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even though prosecutors decided a month ago they have no case against him , a 63-year-old man who carried a loaded . 357 magnum into a Los Angeles federal courthouse remains jailed because an angry judge is refusing on principle to dismiss the charge . Vladimir Flint was arrested Oct . 4 after federal marshals seized the gun he was carrying in a portfolio as he passed_through a metal detector at a Downtown courthouse . In mid-October , he was ordered held without bail as a flight risk and a trial date was set . But on Dec . 13 , one day before Flint was to go_on trial , Assistant U.S. Atty . Alicia Amador told U.S. District Judge David W . Williams that the charge should be dismissed because the government had less of a case than it originally believed . &quot; We initially indicted the case because we didn ' t know a whole_lot about the defendant , &quot; Amador said . &quot; We thought he could be a foreign national . We thought that he could be an assassin . We didn ' t know why he was here in the courthouse. &quot; In fact , Flint , a Nicaraguan native , is a naturalized U.S. citizen , Amador said . He had come_to the courthouse on legitimate business involving his bankruptcy case and had simply forgotten to leave the gun in his car , Amador said . The law requires that the government prove that Flint knowingly entered the courthouse with a firearm . Williams , however , called Amador ' s explanation &quot; baloney &quot; and accused the U.S. attorney ' s office of taking the_matter too lightly . &quot; It ' s a very serious offense for . . . a person to bring a gun in the courthouse . Judges have been shot . Witnesses have been shot , &quot; Williams said from the bench . Although it appears likely that Flint will be freed by the end of the month , the standoff has mushroomed into a cause_celebre from Los Angeles to Washington . The escalation began the day after the mid-December court hearing , when Amador filed a written declaration once again urging dismissal . She said Flint ' s neighbor told her that Flint had been rushing to go_to the courthouse that day and inadvertently brought with him a gun that he sleeps_with for protection against crime . Williams sharply questioned whether it was an innocent mistake , noting that the weapon was placed in a sock and wrapped in a plastic bag . Amador countered that Flint regularly wrapped_up the gun and kept it buried in his Lennox back yard during the daytime . Amador , 32 , who joined the U.S attorney ' s office in 1992 , had the backing of her bosses . One of them , Steven G . Madison , told the judge that under Justice_Department guidelines , prosecutors have an ethical obligation to drop a case &quot; if at any time we believe that there is a doubt about the defendant ' s guilt , irrespective of what we think a jury might do. &quot; But Williams , 83 , a 24-year veteran of the federal bench , again refused to dismiss the indictment , steadfastly maintaining that a jury was entitled to hear the case . After the government filed a notice of appeal , Williams became so infuriated that he wrote to U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno and asked her to dispatch a special prosecutor to handle the case . &quot; The decision not to prosecute is too important to be made by a reasonably inexperienced assistant U.S. attorney backed_up by her two lame_duck superiors , who will leave_office in two weeks , &quot; he wrote . Reno has not responded , but Justice_Department sources say she will not grant the request . Although it is not unusual for Justice_Department lawyers to drop a prosecution , the Flint case is unique , according to all sides . No one associated with the case can remember a judge accusing federal prosecutors of being insufficiently aggressive . In fact , the reverse has often been the case recently . Flint , confined in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Downtown Los Angeles , was not available to discuss his case . But there were plenty of emotional comments from judges , U.S. attorneys and the federal public_defender ' s office , which is representing Flint . &quot; It is inconceivable that the government will not prosecute a case such_as this one that goes_to the heart of law and order in the house of law and order , &quot; U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H . Stotler wrote to Williams , applauding his stand . &quot; We may want to barricade the front_door , purchase our own magnetometer and perhaps carry our own side_arm ! &quot; U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian also expressed outrage at the U.S. attorney ' s office : &quot; They really are saying , ' You judges are expendable , ' &quot; Tevrizian said . &quot; This sends the wrong message to the community. &quot; But another federal judge , speaking anonymously , was bewildered by Williams ' actions . The judge suggested that Williams may be overly sensitive because the incident occurred in his own back yard -- the Edward R . Roybal federal building , where Williams has his chambers . &quot; If this had been a prosecution of someone going_into the Metropolitan Detention Center or a post_office , I don ' t think he would have reacted this way. &quot; Then-U.S. Atty . Terree A . Bowers told Reno in a Dec . 20 letter that he knew the office ' s decision had been controversial , particularly because the Justice_Department ' s No.1 priority is &quot; combatting violent crime. &quot; But he maintained that it was correct . &quot; I understand that there is greater concern with these types of cases because of a spate of recent random shootings that have received considerable publicity . . . . While I understand our district court judge ' s concern with the security of the courthouse , we cannot allow such visceral reactions to override our obligations to see that justice is served. &quot; Bowers also told Reno &quot; that on a fairly regular basis , individuals enter our courthouses having forgotten to remove a weapon from a satchel or briefcase . It is up_to the Federal Protective Service and this office to determine who should be prosecuted criminally . Virtually all individuals are simply cited for an infraction ( $ 50 fine ) , and released. &quot; The new U.S. attorney , Nora M . Manella , has picked_up where Bowers left_off . &quot; When we discover information that leads us to have substantial doubt as_to a defendant ' s guilt , we take whatever steps may be necessary , consistent with our ethical obligations , to prevent a miscarriage of justice , &quot; Manella said . She said she told Williams she understood his concerns -- &quot; It remains of primary importance to us that the federal judges be protected and feel protected &quot; -- but said the office was honor bound not to try the case . Maria E . Stratton , the chief federal public_defender in Los Angeles , frequently clashes with the U.S. attorney ' s office , but she praised her traditional adversaries for continuing their investigation and seeking a dismissal : &quot; I have to credit them for going toe to toe with the judge . I thought it was terrific the way they didn ' t back down. &quot; But Stratton said she is outraged that Flint is still in custody . He may_not be for long , though . On Thursday , responding to a motion from the U.S. attorney ' s office , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals paved the way for Flint to be released . The U.S. attorney had appealed Williams ' refusal to dismiss the case . Ironically , that had the effect of keeping Flint in jail as long as the appeal was pending . So earlier this month , the prosecutors asked_for permission to withdraw their appeal . That request was granted Thursday and will send the case back where the controversy began -- Williams ' courtroom . Manella said the U.S. attorney ' s office will renew its request to drop the charge . If Williams again refuses , the U.S. attorney ' s office will decline to put_on a case , Manella said , and under the federal Speedy Trial Law , Flint should be released within 10 days . Williams said he still believes the case should be tried , but acknowledged that although he can refuse to dismiss the case , he does not have the power to make the U.S. attorney ' s office bring it to trial . &quot; My hands are tied . I can ' t put_on witnesses. &quot; He said that if the U.S. attorney does not change her mind , he will bring the case to a close . &quot; I don ' t think he ( Flint ) should stay in jail forever. &quot;</TEXT>
