   <HEADLINE> ALTMAN DENIES HE MISLED CONGRESS IN WHITEWATER PROBE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman , resisting Republican demands for his resignation , Monday strongly defended himself against allegations that he misled Congress about contacts between the White_House and Treasury officials who were overseeing the government ' s Whitewater investigation . Altman took the offensive on the eve of congressional hearings into allegations that he and other top officials responsible_for the investigation by the Resolution Trust Corp . had improperly transmitted information about the inquiry to President Clinton ' s advisers at the White_House . Citing a recent statement by Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr. , who chose not to prosecute officials involved in the Treasury_Department ' s contacts with the White_House , Altman declared that he did nothing illegal or unethical . He also received a vote_of_confidence from Clinton and Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen . &quot; I believe that Roger Altman has been an excellent deputy Treasury_secretary and we want him to continue in that capacity , &quot; Clinton and Bentsen said in their joint statement . On Feb . 24 , Altman -- a personal friend of the President -- acknowledged under questioning by the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that he had discussed the RTC investigation with White_House officials on one occasion earlier that month . At the time , Altman was acting head of the RTC , which was looking_into possible links between Clinton ' s investment in the Whitewater resort development in the 1970s and a failed Arkansas savings and loan owned by Clinton ' s investment partner , James B . McDougal . When he testified , Altman said Monday , he was unaware of similar discussions that Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson had had with the White_House . Hanson is expected to tell House and Senate committees conducting the Whitewater hearings that she discussed the_matter with White_House officials the previous fall at Altman ' s request . Hanson ' s story has caused Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato of New York and other Republicans to conclude that Altman intentionally misled the Senate Banking Committee . As a result , GOP members are demanding Altman ' s resignation from his job as the No . 2 official at the Treasury_Department . But Altman made_it clear that he will not give_up easily . &quot; As far as taking the fall is concerned , I don ' t expect to do that , &quot; he said . Altman told reporters that he had no recollection of asking Hanson to brief White_House officials about the Whitewater-related investigation but he stopped short of accusing her of lying . He said he was unaware of Hanson ' s claim until recently . &quot; My testimony was correct , &quot; Altman said . &quot; I have no recollection of asking Ms . Hanson to brief the White_House . There is nothing unusual for recollections to differ . The events in_question occurred five months before my testimony . I know that she has a different recollection . I just disagree. &quot; As acting RTC head until last March 31 , Altman was technically responsible_for the agency ' s investigation into allegations that money from the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was diverted by McDougal to his joint Whitewater investment with Clinton . But Altman insisted that he never knew anything about the substance of the investigation and that he did not discuss it in detail with White_House officials . Instead , he said , he simply briefed then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum on the publicly acknowledged procedures that the RTC would be using to investigate Clinton ' s controversial investment . &quot; At a more significant level , &quot; he added , &quot; I made no decisions and never influenced the direction or the substance of the Madison case at any time during my tenure at the RTC . And I never imparted any non-public information about the case to the White_House or anyone else. &quot; Altman also denied a number of other recent news_reports about his knowledge of the Whitewater inquiry and his role in advising the White_House about it . Among other things , he disputed a statement that Joshua L . Steiner , Bentsen ' s chief_of_staff , reportedly wrote in a personal diary . According to those who have read the diary , Steiner wrote that White_House officials had put heavy pressure on Altman not to recuse himself from playing a role in the Whitewater matter . On Feb . 25 , one day after testifying before the Senate Banking Committee about his discussions of the Whitewater investigation with White_House officials , Altman announced that he was removing himself from any further official involvement in the case . The announcement apparently took the White_House by surprise . On Monday , Altman insisted that his recusal was only a perfunctory step because he had already told RTC officials that he wanted to play no part in the Whitewater case . As a result , he said , he was never privy to any inside_information about the substance of the case . After he recused himself , Altman said , he received a call from White_House aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold M . Ickes , who told him that the President was angry that he had not been notified in_advance . As a result , he said , he regretted his failure to warn the White_House . Altman also denied reports that a former RTC official told him in March , 1993 , that the RTC had referred the Whitewater case to the Justice_Department for possible criminal prosecution . &quot; I firmly believe that he did not do so . That is my recollection , &quot; he said . At the same time , Altman did acknowledge reports that he has surrendered to congressional investigators several pages of his so-called &quot; scrapbook , &quot; in which he is said to have written that First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton strongly opposed the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Whitewater matter . Contrary to some reports , Altman said , he does not keep a diary . He said that the scrapbook , which includes newspaper_clippings , documents and occasional handwritten comments , contained no more_than a_few sentences pertaining to Whitewater . Altman declined to say exactly what he had written in the scrapbook about the First_Lady , but he noted that he had already apologized to her for any embarrassment his remarks might cause her when -- and if -- they are made public during the congressional hearings . He also told reporters that both the President and Mrs . Clinton have told him on separate occasions that he should not be concerned about the political ruckus that his Whitewater-related activities have caused on Capitol_Hill . Hearings into the_matter begin today with the testimony of White_House Counsel Lloyd N . Cutler before the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee . Another session is scheduled for Thursday , with three more next week . The Senate Banking Committee starts its Whitewater hearings Friday . Preview of House Hearings The House Banking Committee begins its inquiry today , while the Senate banking panel will follow with separate hearings on Friday .
