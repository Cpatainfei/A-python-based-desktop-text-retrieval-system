   <TEXT> This is a story of people who made a world in their image and of how it came_apart . Their world is a self-contained planet in a bottle outside Tucson called Biosphere 2 -- an ambitious ecology experiment that draws 250 # 000 tourists every year to browse past its souvenir stands , admire its architecture and gawk at its sculptures constructed of scrap metal recycled from nuclear_weapons laboratories . A harsh struggle for control of this artificial Earth has torn_apart the secretive community of engineers , eco-warriors and money men that worked to raise a $ 150-million monument in the desert to their vision of a better life under glass . Today , the Biosphere project is in temporary receivership . One founder was hospitalized for stress ; another has been indicted on charges she sabotaged the Biosphere she once inhabited . A third -- Edward P . Bass , the Texas multimillionaire who bankrolled the test-tube Earth -- is prepared to face_off in federal_court next month to cement his authority over the facility . Theirs is a cautionary fable of free-wheeling finance and the private enterprise of science . To the outside world , the people of the Biosphere crafted a public image of cheery environmental activists , dressed like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in matching jumpsuits , intent_on building the ark that they thought would help establish humanity on Mars . But private letters , diaries , faxes , internal memos and court papers reveal deep organizational tensions , fractious internal disputes , and mutual suspicions that have been building since the Biosphere was completed in 1991 . The world of the Biosphere , documents show , is one in which the inquiries of outside scientists conducting peer_review were seen as slander , routine committee_meetings were taken as evidence of a conspiratorial cabal , and even a simple internal business audit was considered a grab for power . In the end , the environmental visionaries came_up hard against an eccentric businessman whose funds may have seemed inexhaustible but whose patience was not . Earlier this month , Bass obtained a court_order to formally oust the key managers of the Biosphere and seize the premises . He also formally dissolved the partnership between the project ' s financial arm , which he controls , and its management team , including founders John Allen and Margret Augustine . In an interview , Allen called the situation &quot; the biggest scandal in science I know of. &quot; Augustine could not be reached for comment . Bass , through a spokeswoman , has turned_down requests for an interview . &quot; His lawyers have advised him not to make any comment until the court case is completed , &quot; said Terrell Lamb , his media consultant , in a formal statement on behalf of the Bass organization . &quot; The fundamental problem with the management of Space Biospheres Ventures was that Ed Bass was persistently lied to. &quot; But the ousted employees and others involved in running the Biosphere made available copies of corporate minutes , internal memos , chapters of unpublished manuscripts , a videotape and correspondence that help shed new light on how the experiment was run . The Biosphere 2 project , operated formally by a company called Space Biospheres Ventures run_by Bass , Augustine and Allen , was a volatile blend of New Age idealism and corporate sophistication . Biosphere 1 , in their view , is the planet Earth . It started as a shared fantasy in an avant-garde theater troupe of environmental zealots and trust-fund hippies on a Santa Fe ranch in the early 1970s . There was Bass , the second son of the Ft . Worth Bass family , which has amassed holdings worth several billion dollars . There was Allen , the restless son of an Oklahoma farmer , who harbored a store of visionary ideas on how to save the environment or , at least -- through Space_Age arks such_as the Biosphere -- survive its destruction . They hoped that such self-supporting enclaves could become the model for a colony on Mars . With Bass providing the bankroll , Allen , Augustine and others in the troupe built an empire of hotels , ranches and ecologically oriented companies over the next 15 years in a network of holdings stretching from Ft . Worth to Nepal , knitted together through about 40 corporate and legal entities . As recently as 1986 , they were still staging plays_at the Theater of All Possibilities in Ft . Worth , with Bass acting the role of what one reviewer called a &quot; mogul of illusion &quot; in a science_fiction drama Allen wrote under a pseudonym . To build the Biosphere , the group married the romantic rhetoric of spaceflight and the set design of &quot; Star Trek &quot; to the humble hoe-and-compost-heap technology of waste recycling . From the beginning , they intended that the Biosphere should be a money-making venture . Today , Biosphere ' s outward appearance belies its internal turmoil . The three-acre terrarium by the Santa Catalina Mountains contains a rain_forest , a desert and a tiny ocean as well as 3 # 800 species of plants and animals that nourish one another in what its owners like to call the largest self-sustaining ecosystem ever built ( except Earth , of course ) . They decorated the grounds with their own brand of sculpture -- metal icons of nuclear terror . There are plans for a golf_course . As they assembled its foundations during the 1980s , the group was dogged by bizarre published reports that Allen , a man some described as a &quot; poetic pussycat , &quot; was a cult leader who routinely tongue-lashed Bass , on occasion hit him and psychologically coerced him into funding projects . Both men have denied the more lurid stories , blaming disgruntled employees for them . The stories were enough , however , to prompt Allen to formally resign his post in 1985 as a consultant to Decisions Team Ltd. , one of the holding companies overseeing the Biosphere . Allen stayed_on as vice_president of biospherics at Space Ventures until earlier this month , when he resigned to protest Bass ' court action . In a recent affidavit , Bass sought a temporary restraining order barring Allen and others from the Biosphere because &quot; based on my past experiences , such persons have demonstrated the capability to react irrationally or destructively . . . . &quot; Bass , 48 , is described by associates as something of a loner who used to spend half of every year on a 500 # 000-acre ranch in Australia . He now rarely gets farther than Ft . Worth . He donated $ 20 million to Yale_University , his alma_mater , to study the environment and the ecology . He has never given a detailed explanation of his reasons for investing in the Biosphere project , but to a man whose family has made several billion dollars on investments in Walt Disney Co. , the idea of an ecological theme park along the lines of Epcot or Sea World seemed reasonable . Until recently , the Basses owned a 24.9 % share of Disney . In a written response to a reporter ' s query several years ago about the theme park aspects of the Biosphere , Bass said : &quot; As to the accusatory claims that this is Disneyland , it certainly is . . . . It would be a waste to be doing this without giving a means for people to access it . Besides , ( tourism ) is a significant source of revenue. &quot; The most recent turmoil was presaged by a widely publicized dispute last year that resulted in the resignations of the Biosphere ' s independent Science Advisory Committee ( SAC ) . That disagreement centered_on questions of scientific standards , just as the more recent fight revolved_around questions of financial standards . The disputes , observers say , show how the managers responded to criticism by working to limit outside scrutiny and how pervasive their distrust of Bass was becoming . The group of eminent scientists that made_up the committee , which was chaired by Thomas E . Lovejoy , a senior official at the Smithsonian Institution , had been recruited in 1992 to bolster the project ' s scientific credibility . Lovejoy is the assistant secretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian . Committee_members have repeatedly declined to detail their reasons for leaving the project . Several still work as Biosphere consultants . Previously unpublished letters between Bass and Lovejoy last year reveal the degree to which the dispute centered_on the board ' s objections to the way Allen and Augustine ran the Biosphere , citing concerns that the data was unreliable and &quot; a pattern on the part of Biosphere 2 staff of withholding information and lying. &quot; The board was created after the project ' s combination of serious science and theme park commercialism earned hoots and hosannas in equal measure from mainstream scientists . Its scientific achievements were tainted by what many critics saw as evidence of duplicity . The most serious complaints involved allegations concerning the fundamental honesty of the Biosphere experiment , in which the test_tube itself was one of the unknowns . Project managers had vowed that the Biosphere would be self-supporting during its first two-year experimental run , from 1991 to 1993 , growing its own food , generating its own air and recycling all its wastes . As soon as the first eight-member crew was sealed inside Sept . 26 , 1991 , however , reports quickly surfaced that they were living_on stored food supplies and that they were replenishing the inside atmosphere with extra oxygen . Unknown to the public at the time , a carbon_dioxide scrubber had also been installed to eliminate harmful build-up of dangerous gases . The project managers considered expelling one crew_member from the Biosphere for revealing the existence of the food stores , documents show . As problems and criticism mounted , the people running the project retreated into a defensive shell -- the emotional equivalent of the Biosphere . By January , 1993 , the science advisers , anxious to ensure the reliability of the data the Biosphere was producing and restore its credibility , had decided that Allen , Augustine and other local managers were a fundamental part of the problem , not part of the solution . &quot; They are making mistakes and they don ' t even know they are making them , &quot; one committee_member says on a videotape of an informal meeting in January , 1993 . When one employee took his complaints directly to the scientists , Bass complained to Lovejoy that the committee &quot; seems to have become a lightning_rod for not only legitimate matters , but also for complaints and grievances of all sorts . Frankly I cannot distinguish the truth amongst the muddle. &quot; Allen criticized the science committee as a &quot; hit team from the Establishment &quot; orchestrated by Bass , according to an unpublished diary kept by one employee . Mark Nelson , a founding member of the team who spent two years inside the Biosphere , said in a recent interview that the committee had nothing to do with research and &quot; totally to do with discrediting the management in an attempt to take_over the corporation. &quot; Bass defended the managers , however , the 1993 letters show . &quot; What has been increasingly difficult is the insistence . . . that I remove Margret Augustine and John Allen from their management positions with the corporation , &quot; Bass wrote to Lovejoy . &quot; To take your advice literally would almost certainly shut_down the project and jeopardize its entire future. &quot; In a second letter he wrote , &quot; I certainly never intended the committee to involve itself in matters far afield from science relating to the management of a privately held and highly diverse business. &quot; Bass said the committee ' s inquiry was &quot; very questionable ethically. &quot; The project managers were so upset about the committee ' s inquiry that before the committee had a chance to determine whether any of the allegations were true , they persuaded Bass to order Lovejoy and board_members to stop talking to each other except when formally convened by the Biospherians . &quot; Science does not work that way , &quot; Lovejoy responded bluntly in a letter to the financier and submitted his resignation . In February , 1993 , the senior managers voted to dissolve the science committee . Barely a year would pass before Bass would move to dismiss Augustine and Allen under conditions that Nelson would call an eerie replay of the dispute over the science committee . Again , outside scrutiny would trigger a crisis . As the Biosphere 2 project skirted the edge of scientific respectability , the managers found that profits also were elusive . &quot; Though conceived as a profit-producing venture , Biosphere 2 has yet to make a profit , and is currently requiring substantial cash funding , &quot; Bass said in an affidavit . Senior managers were looking_for someone to buy the Biosphere -- the asking price for an equity share was to be $ 300 million -- and several of the original Biosphere crew were suing for payment of back salaries . The senior managers and Bass spent hours in board_meetings discussing plans to put the project on a sounder footing . When Bass tried to install Beverly Hills investment_banker Stephen K . Bannon as an interim chief_executive_officer , Augustine would not let him on the property and told employees not to talk to him , according to Bass ' affidavit . And when Bass tried to check the company ' s financial records , the managers would not let the auditor talk to employees and would not let him see the accounting records , court papers said . When Bass commissioned an outside auditing firm to check the accounts , Allen , Augustine , Nelson and other senior managers voted March 28 to suspend the audit , corporate minutes show . The auditors &quot; were going_to kill the management there and finish the job the SAC had failed to do , &quot; Allen said in an interview . Three days later , Bass was in federal_court in Ft . Worth to end the partnership . The next day -- April_Fool ' s Day -- Allen , Nelson , Augustine ( who checked_out of the hospital last week ) and the others were officially barred from the Biosphere they had built . Two of them -- Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo , who had spent two years inside the Biosphere as part of the first crew -- were arrested for opening the sealed enclosure to let_in outside air . On Thursday , a grand_jury in Arizona dropped the charges against Van Thillo , but formally indicted Alling . If convicted , she faces_up to 22 months in prison and a $ 150 # 000 fine . &quot; What I think has happened so far is in the best interests of the project , &quot; Linda Leigh , co-captain of the crew that spent two years in the Biosphere , said in an interview . &quot; I ' m really behind Ed Bass 100 % . &quot; Charting Biosphere 2 Here are some key dates in the Biosphere 2 project : * 1984 : John P . Allen is said to have come_up with idea that led to development of Biosphere 2 . * Sept . 26 , 1991 : An eight-person crew enters Biosphere 2 . * January , 1993 : Oxygen is pumped into the project after level drops too low . * Feb . 5 : An independent panel of 10 scientists helping oversee the Biosphere experiment quits , citing of a lack of cooperation from project managers . * Sept . 26 : The first crew leaves the complex . * March 6 , 1994 : A seven-member crew enters Biosphere 2 . * March 15 : Crew_members Jane Poynter and Taber MacCallum sue for back pay and $ 10 # 000 bonuses they say they never received after their two-year stay in the sealed glass dome . * March 31 : Edward P . Bass , chief financial backer , gets temporary restraining order to suspend top managers of project , alleging financial mismanagement . * April 4 : Someone on the outside breaks Biosphere ' s air_lock seals . * April 6 : Two members of Biosphere ' s first crew , Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo , are arrested on trespassing , burglary and property damage charges stemming from the April 4 incident . * April 7 : Alling and Thillo are fired . * April 8 : Allen resigns . Crew_member Norberto Alvarez-Romo leaves the sealed environment because of a family emergency involving his wife , ousted president and chief_executive_officer Margret Augustine .</TEXT>
