   <HEADLINE> IRAQ OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES KUWAIT , BUT U.S. IS SKEPTICAL ; MIDEAST : HUSSEIN USED CLAIM TO LAND AS EXCUSE FOR 1990 INVASION . WASHINGTON NOT READY TO LIFT SANCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq , heeding the demand of the Security_Council , officially recognized Kuwait on Thursday , but skeptical American officials insisted that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein must still meet a host of other requirements before the United Nations can lift any sanctions . The recognition means that Iraq has abandoned its traditional claim to Kuwait , a claim that Hussein invoked as his excuse for invading the small emirate in 1990 and precipitating the Persian_Gulf_War that ended with his defeat . According to a statement issued in Baghdad , the Iraqi capital , and purportedly signed by Hussein , the Revolutionary Command Council decided to recognize &quot; the sovereignty of the state of Kuwait , its territorial integrity and political independence. &quot; The council , headed by Hussein , also recognized the international Iraq-Kuwait boundary set_down by a U.N. commission in 1991 . The council said it was taking these steps because of its respect for the U.N. Charter and international_law and its intention &quot; to comply fully with all relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. &quot; The Iraqi National Assembly also recognized the independence and boundary of Kuwait , passing the resolution in a special_session attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev . The Russian foreign_minister has annoyed American officials recently with his persistent campaign to lift some of the sanctions on Iraq . The Iraqi News_Agency quoted Kozyrev as saying , &quot; There is a wall of ice surrounding Iraq , intended to isolate it , but the sun has now risen to melt this ice. &quot; Despite the skeptical reaction from Americans , the Iraqi government intends to press its case for at least a partial end to sanctions by sending Deputy Prime_Minister Tarik Aziz , who has long served Hussein as spokesman to the Western world , to the United Nations on Monday . American Ambassador Madeleine Albright told reporters that she has agreed to meet him , but only in her capacity as president of the Security_Council for the month of November . A meeting of the two would mark the highest-level Iraqi-American meeting since the Gulf War . But a U.S. official cautioned against &quot; attaching any significance to the meeting. &quot; Albright will not be meeting Aziz as American ambassador , he said . James P . Rubin , spokesman for Albright , made_it clear that the United States will not agree to any lifting of sanctions when the Security_Council makes its bimonthly review of the issue next week . Without the acquiescence of the United States , which has the power of veto in the Security_Council , no lifting of sanctions is possible . The recognition of Kuwait &quot; complied with only one of a number of requirements set by the Security_Council , &quot; Rubin said . &quot; We have to keep_in mind that Saddam Hussein ' s blatant provocation against Kuwait and the United Nations last month demonstrated anew his untrustworthiness and his readiness to resort_to threats and confrontation to achieve his objectives . &quot; It will be important , &quot; he went_on , &quot; that the council continue to make clear there will be no modification of the sanctions regime so_long as Iraq has failed to establish its peaceful intentions by complying fully with all relevant Security_Council resolutions. &quot; This longstanding American position is at_odds with that of Kozyrev and , to some extent , the_French government . The Russians and French have argued that the Security_Council should follow the strict letter of the Security_Council resolutions . Under this strict reading , the sanctions on the sale of oil will be lifted when a U.N. special commission determines that Iraq has eliminated all_of its weapons of mass destruction and has submitted to a system of long-term monitoring that makes_sure it does not build such weapons again . But American officials say that it is impossible to trust Hussein ' s acceptance of a monitoring system as long as he has not complied with all Security_Council resolutions . To prove his good intentions , they say , the Iraqi leader must comply with various other Security_Council demands , including an accounting of missing Kuwaiti prisoners , a halt in the persecution of the Kurds and Shiite Muslims in his country , and payment of compensation to Kuwait for destroyed property and to other countries hurt by the war . The argument has led to some angry exchanges between the Americans , who appear sure that the_French and Russians are interested only in resuming a lucrative trade , and the_French and Russians , who seem certain that the Americans have no intention of ever lifting sanctions against Iraq . The American refusal to halt sanctions was strengthened by a report from Rolf Ekeus of Sweden , the head of the special commission , who said Iraqi officials barely cooperated with his inspectors during the past month . But Ekeus attributed this to fallout from the crisis provoked by Hussein last month when he moved troops to the Kuwait border in a manner that the United States said threatened a new invasion . Ekeus told reporters that he looked_on the recognition of Kuwait as an &quot; extremely positive &quot; development because it seemed logical for it to lead to &quot; a policy of full cooperation &quot; with the commission ' s inspectors .</TEXT>
