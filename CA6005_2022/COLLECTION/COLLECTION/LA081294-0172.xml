   <HEADLINE> FOREIGN_POLICY TROUBLES BLOW THE WHISTLE ON ARGENTINE CHIEF ; LATIN_AMERICA : WHILE HE STILL GETS HIGH MARKS FOR ECONOMIC_POLICIES , MENEM ' S POPULARITY HAS PLUMMETED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As tens of thousands rallied outside Congress to condemn a deadly bombing at a Jewish community_center here last month , a speaker announced the arrival of President Carlos Saul Menem . The rain-soaked air was suddenly filled with whistles -- the_Argentine equivalent of boos and hisses . Apparently chastened by the unfriendly reception , Menem , who rarely misses a chance to address a crowd , chose not to speak . The bombing , questions about the lax security that allowed it and doubts about the government ' s ability to investigate it are only the latest in a series of troubling challenges to Argentina ' s 62-year-old president . Menem has watched his popularity plummet to its lowest level in two years , and the luster of his self-proclaimed &quot; economic miracle &quot; is beginning to show signs of tarnish . The timing is especially bad because Menem has just won permission to run_for reelection , thanks to a new constitution that he spent months lobbying to have rewritten . While he still gets high marks for economic_policies that have spurred healthy growth and slowed runaway inflation , Menem has stumbled in recent weeks on foreign_policy matters , giving the appearance that his government suffers from disorganization and internal discord . Eager to please Washington and move once-isolated Argentina from its tradition of nonalignment , Menem was quick to offer Argentine troops for a U.S.-led invasion of Haiti . Two days later , he retracted the offer amid protests from his own military as well as the public . In the wake of the July 18 Jewish center bombing , which killed nearly 100 people , the president stated he would break_off diplomatic relations with Iran if it is proven that Iranian diplomats assisted the terrorists . &quot; Diplomatic services and embassies are there to consolidate relations between countries and not to participate , if this turns_out to be the case , . . . in this type of act , &quot; Menem told reporters . Barely a week later , Menem again backtracked . His government said Tuesday that even if the Iranian Embassy is implicated in the bombing , it would be unwise to rupture ties because Iran might retaliate . And once the federal judge in_charge of the case issued arrest_warrants for four former Iranian diplomats , Menem said expulsion of the Iranian ambassador might be appropriate -- but not a break_in diplomatic relations . &quot; His foreign_policy is coherent in its objectives -- aligning Argentina with the West and the United States -- but it has been rather improvised in its execution , &quot; political analyst Rosendo Fraga said . The miscalculations extend_to most areas of government except economic_policy , Fraga said . Fraga and other analysts add , however , that there is still time for Menem to recover before the presidential election next May , depending_on actions he takes_in the crucial months ahead and whether the Jewish bombing case is satisfactorily resolved . &quot; we ' ll see him deepen his economic plan , but to improve his image he will have to come_up with some novel things . . . ( such_as ) a strong anti-corruption move , social_action , initiatives on education or law and order , the things people care about , &quot; pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo said . Menem ' s popularity dipped to a two-year low in a Gallup poll published late last month by La Nacion newspaper . It showed a 27 % approval rating , down from 50 % last October . October was a high point for Menem , analysts say . His party scored impressive victories in congressional balloting , and a confident Menem launched his campaign for reelection . To be able to succeed himself , Menem , a Peronist , had to have Argentina ' s 141-year-old constitution amended . He struck a deal with the opposition Radical Civic Union , led by former President Raul Alfonsin ; Alfonsin agreed to a reelection clause in the new constitution , in exchange for limits on presidential power . Menem ' s good standing began to erode after that deal , which was reached in secret and accompanied by rumors of payoffs . Then the constituent assembly , convened May 25 to draft the new constitution , descended into near-violent debates and projected a rather negative image of politicians . Riots last December in the province of Santiago del Estero and a massive protest rally outside the president ' s Casa Rosada last month underscored the weaknesses in Menem ' s much-vaunted economic program . The protesters in both cases complained that free-market reforms were widening the divide between rich and poor . Menem ' s program , under the direction of Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo , has sustained 30 % growth in the past three years and slashed inflation from 5 # 000 % in 1989 to 7.4 % last year . But figures released in July showed a record unemployment_rate of 10.8 % . The currency is overvalued , and Argentina ' s huge trade_deficit soared even higher during the first_half of the year . And although Menem weathered allegations that linked his former wife ' s relatives to money-laundering for drug_traffickers , a series of corruption scandals involving his party further dented public confidence . In international affairs , Menem has been determined to end Argentina ' s isolation , epitomized when the South_American_nation declared war on Britain over the Falkland Islands in 1982 . But his efforts to lock-step with Washington have meant at times turning aside the Latin_American tradition of nonintervention . The Haiti matter was particularly awkward . As a member of the U.N. Security_Council , Argentina was the only Latin country to vote last month in favor of a resolution authorizing military_force to restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . As he did_in the Persian_Gulf_War , Menem offered to send troops . The United States followed the offer with an announcement that it was leasing a tank transport vessel to Argentina despite a British-inspired arms embargo . Officials in Buenos Aires and Washington denied the ship was a reward for Argentina ' s cooperation on Haiti . But Menem apparently failed to calculate domestic opposition . Defense Minister Oscar Camilion publicly criticized the offer . And an opinion poll published in the newspaper Clarin showed 82.3 % of the respondents were opposed to sending troops to Haiti . Only 14.4 % were in favor .</TEXT>
