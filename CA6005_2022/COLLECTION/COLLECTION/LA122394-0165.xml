   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL ; Q &amp; A ; WHAT THE FREE FLOATING OF THE PESO COULD MEAN FOR INVESTORS , OTHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What are the immediate and long-term repercussions on workers , investors and business people on both sides of the border from Mexico ' s decision Thursday to let the peso trade freely against the dollar ? Here are some answers : * Q : What happened ? A : The Mexican government , which has been holding the value of its currency fairly steady for seven years , moved to let it float against the dollar -- making its value subject_to market forces just like the values of the German mark , British_pound , Japanese yen and other major world currencies . But because the Mexican government has been keeping its currency ' s value artificially high , Thursday ' s surprising move resulted in the peso plunging -- more_than 20 % on Thursday and more_than 30 % since last Friday . * Q : Why is this important ? A : The peso ' s stability has been at the center of Mexican economic reforms , which have stabilized wages and consumer prices and attracted huge sums in foreign investment . By pulling the rug out from under the peso , many investors believe , the government is signaling a change of heart . If Mexico returns to its past of high inflation and currency devaluation , that could have a disastrous impact on business , employment and investment in the country . * Q : Then why did Mexico do this ? A : There are several factors , but a primary one is that the government was depleting its foreign reserves by trying to prop_up the peso at levels still seen as overvalued by the world currency markets . The government spent an estimated $ 4 billion in foreign_exchange reserves over the past two days alone to keep the currency from falling further . That had depleted those reserves to $ 6.5 billion -- down from $ 17 billion as recently as Nov . 1 . * Q : How does this affect the average U.S. citizen ? A : The repercussions are potentially dramatic , though somewhat indirect . Mexico is one of California ' s largest trading partners , buying everything from electronic components to chemicals to lumber , while selling such products as textiles , produce and leather . If the peso remains weak , Mexicans will be forced to pay more for U.S. goods . That could hurt sales by exporters and manufacturers and ultimately lead to layoffs of U.S. workers . However , Americans traveling_to Mexico or buying Mexican products are likely to see their dollars go_further than ever before . * Q : How will this affect illegal immigration ? A : Many illegal immigrants come here because of economic woes in their own country , which could be exaggerated by the currency swings , says Max Schetter , director of the economic research bureau at the Greater San Diego Chamber_of_Commerce . Further , U.S. dollars now buy more in Mexico . That creates a huge incentive to come here , earn dollars and send them to relatives south of the border . The currency devaluation &quot; is like an electromagnet attracting Mexicans to the U.S. economy , &quot; Schetter says . * Q : Why would this create an economic burden on Mexican citizens ? After all , if you ' re earning pesos and buying products with pesos , why would you care about the value of the peso when compared to a foreign currency ? A : In a nutshell , a decline in the value of the peso creates inflationary pressures inside Mexico . that ' s simply because Mexican companies are buying goods from international suppliers . The cost of those goods is now higher . Additionally , Mexico ' s domestic producers can raise their prices because they ' re now competing with higher-priced foreign goods . Workers , grappling with a higher cost_of_living , may demand higher wages . If they get higher wages , inflation is boosted even more . If they don ' t , they must live more sparsely -- and their average standard_of_living is already far lower than that in the United States . * Q : What does this mean to investors in the Mexican stock_market ? A : It ' s still too early to say for_sure . In theory , the devaluation should boost exports of Mexican goods and services . That would be good for the economy and business as_a_whole . But because the value of the peso dropped so dramatically , some experts believe any boost to exports could be more_than offset by inflationary pressures within Mexico . Moreover , they worry that the confidence of foreign investors was shattered by this move , largely because the government of President Ernesto Zedillo had assured investors Wednesday that it would not allow its currency to fall further . With Thursday ' s action , investors rightly questioned whether the Mexican government is serious about keeping its promises to investors , says Alan Shapiro , chairman of the finance and business economics_department at USC . * Q : What about Mexican bonds ? A : Again , there are some uncertainties , but the prognosis appears bleak . Short-term interest_rates have already been boosted , which hurts bond values . U.S. investors , who bought peso-denominated bonds , get doubly hit with the huge drop_in the value of Mexican currency . Even dollar-denominated bonds issued by Mexican companies are at risk , says Carl Ericson , vice_president and manager of the Colonial Investments Strategic Income Fund . that ' s because these companies are still earning the bulk of their income in pesos , but they ' re paying on their debt in costly foreign currency . That puts strain on their balance_sheets and makes them comparatively less credit-worthy , he says . * Q : Should I sell my funds that hold Mexican securities ? A : At least nine U.S. mutual_funds investing in Mexico lost more_than 8 % of their value in the past two days . While it ' s rarely smart to sell in a panic , it certainly makes_sense to evaluate why you ' re investing in Mexico and whether the reasons you first invested still hold true . You should also monitor the economic climate there to make_sure your investments won ' t suffer in an inflationary environment . * Q : I ' m about to go_on vacation in Mexico . Does this mean my hotel and everything else is going_to cost less ? A : Possibly but not necessarily , says Paul Albrecht , director of industry relations at Globus-Cosmos Tourama , a travel wholesaler that arranges land tours all_over the world . Many tourist hotels set their rates in U.S. dollars . If that ' s the case , they ' re unlikely to give you a break . However , your meals and souvenirs are likely to be significantly cheaper . Additionally , people who stray from traditional tourist areas and buy products and services in pesos will see a surge in spending power , he says . &quot; This is terrible for people who invest in Mexico but great for people who travel there , &quot; Albrecht says . * MAIN STORY : A1 * RELATED STORIES : D1</TEXT>
