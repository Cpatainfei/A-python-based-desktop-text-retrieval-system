   <HEADLINE> A MONSTROUS EFFORT ; KOREAN AUTO_MAKER KIA TACKLES THE L.A. MARKET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The television ads feature a Godzilla-like creature named Gorgo stomping through downtown Tokyo as screaming residents flee the imperiled city . The message : &quot; There ' s only one thing more frightening to Japan : a well-built car for under $ 8 # 500. &quot; In truth , Japanese auto_makers abandoned the low-priced new-car market in the United States several years ago . But there ' s no doubt that , despite the hyperbole , the television and billboard campaign is helping to establish America ' s newest import line , South_Korean auto_maker Kia Motors Corp . Since its Feb . 3 premiere in Portland , Ore. , Kia has opened 50 dealerships in the West and sold 2 # 600 of its compact economy cars , which are priced as low as $ 8 # 495 . Now Kia is coming_to greater Los Angeles -- the nation ' s toughest car market -- with the scheduled opening Thursday of 16 dealerships that cover a territory stretching from Bakersfield to Cathedral City but are concentrated in Los Angeles and Orange counties . The dealers , all_of which already sell other brands , are anxious to see if Kia will live_up_to its advertising or flop like the 1961 movie &quot; Gorgo , &quot; in which Kia ' s monster mascot originally starred . Although new_to the United States , Kia has a track record . It sells cars under its own name in 90 countries and produces nearly 700 # 000 cars and trucks a year . With revenue of more_than $ 4 billion last year , it ranks 333rd on Fortune ' s Global 500 list and is South_Korea ' s second-largest car_maker , after Hyundai Motor Corp . In 1987 , Kia contracted with Ford Motor Co . to begin manufacturing the Ford-designed Festiva economy car . That successful venture has put more_than 800 # 000 Kia-built cars into American garages . Kia also builds the Ford Aspire , which replaced the Festiva this year . A former Hyundai Motor America executive , W . Greg Warner , is chief operating officer of Kia ' s U.S. sales operation , which is headquartered in Irvine . Intimately familiar_with Hyundai ' s spectacular 1986 launch -- and the myriad problems its early sales successes caused -- Warner is_on a mission to ensure that Kia does not repeat Hyundai ' s mistakes . To do that , he designed a go-slow approach . Kia first is seeking a regional base , opening dealerships in quick succession in Oregon , Nevada , Washington , Arizona , Utah , Colorado , Northern California and , last month , San Diego County . The company is entering the U.S. market with only one model , the four-door Sephia , though Kia plans to introduce a sport utility vehicle in December and a mid-sized sedan next year . And typically , it is the third or even fourth brand on its dealers ' lots , which means Kia dealers don ' t need to make big investments in separate showrooms . Most reviews give the Sephia high marks for quality at a low to moderate price and find the styling acceptable , though not trend-setting . But Kia gets knocked for omitting air_bags and for having the smallest engine in its class , which includes four-door versions of the Saturn , Ford Escort , Mazda Protege and , if one can be found , a base-priced Dodge Neon . In Las Vegas , where Kias have been part of the Budget Rent-A-Car fleet since August , the Sephia -- which comes_in three trim levels -- has become one of the city ' s best-selling four-door automobiles . Courtesy Kia , the lone dealer in the Nevada gaming capital , sold 75 of the $ 8 # 500- $ 12 # 000 cars in just 23 days of February , according to owner Harold Drezner . There were more Sephias registered to private owners in Las Vegas that month than new four-door Honda Civics , Ford Escorts , Nissan Sentras or Toyota Corollas , according to data collected by independent analyst R.L. Polk &amp; Co . But no one really expects the car to become a phenomenal seller overnight . Industry_analysts , Kia dealers and even the dark-suited executives at Kia Motors America Inc. ' s headquarters say the goal is to start small and grow at a moderate pace while building a solid reputation for customer service and product reliability . Warner is determined that his company not repeat Hyundai ' s experience . When that company ' s subcompact Excel hit the market at less than $ 5 # 000 , it was an instant hit . The factory opted to make as_many cars as it could sell instead of the number its quality-control system could handle . As a result , Hyundai set U.S. records for a new automobile franchise , selling more_than 250 # 000 cars in its second year and almost a_million by 1989 . But then the bubble burst ; its overzealousness left Hyundai with a reputation as a maker of inexpensive but unreliable cars . The image has hung_on , though industry experts say the reliability problems have been cured . Warner says Kia has produced a competitive economy car that meets or exceeds the basic quality standards set by the Japanese auto industry . Industry specialists such_as Tom Dukes , competitive market_analyst at J.D. Power &amp; Associates , agree . &quot; I was prepared not to like it , &quot; Dukes said , &quot; but I was pleasantly surprised . All the fundamentals are there. &quot; Jeannine Saniz certainly thinks so . And while positive reviews from consultants are nice , Saniz ' s opinion is more important -- because she actually bought a Sephia . The 21-year-old San Diego bank teller and her husband were about to purchase a $ 13 # 800 Geo Prizm -- the Toyota Corolla clone built_in Northern California -- when Kia ' s advertising blitz in San Diego caught their attention . She drove 40 minutes to a new Kia dealership in Carlsbad last month to look_at Sephias and drove_away in a turquoise model with air conditioning , power_steering , automatic_transmission and an AM-FM radio and cassette_player for just over $ 12 # 000 . For the $ 1 # 800 savings , Saniz said , she doesn ' t mind not having an air_bag -- a safety device Kia says will arrive with its 1995 models . &quot; We were really surprised at the quality for the price , &quot; she said . One item that helped clinch the sale : Kia provides a 36-month bumper-to-bumper warranty that includes 24-hour roadside service . Kia ' s employees own the largest block of the company ' s stock , at 12 % ; Ford owns a 10 % stake , and Japan ' s Mazda Motors Corp. , which supplies the designs for Kia engines and transmissions , owns 8 % . The rest of the company ' s shares are traded on the Korean Stock_Exchange . The employee stake , as well as the Mazda and Ford links , are reasons that Carson auto retailing magnate Don Kott sought a Kia franchise . Kott already sells Fords , Lincolns , Mercurys , Chryslers , Plymouths , Isuzus and heavy trucks . &quot; I know they build a good product , &quot; Kott said . &quot; Of all_the cars we ' ve sold over the past 10 years , the Festiva has had the lowest incidence of repair. &quot; The 6-foot-4 , 300-pound car_dealer said there ' s another thing he likes about the Sephia : &quot; I fit_in it and am comfortable . And that ' s unlike a lot of small cars. &quot; New Kia on the Block Though it is virtually unknown in the United States , South_Korea ' s Kia Motors Corp . sells vehicles in 90 other countries . Car and light truck production figures for 1993 in major markets worldwide , in millions of units : General Motors : 6.44 Ford Motor Co. : 5.60 Toyota Motor Corp. : 4.33 Nissan Motor Co. : 3.23 Volkswagen AG : 2.35 Chrysler Corp. : 2.28 Honda Motor Co. : 1.89 Peugeot-Citroen PSA : 1.66 Mitsubishi Motors Corp. : 1.39 Renault SA : 1.39 Mazda Motor Corp. : 1.34 Fiat Group : 1.17 Hyundai Motor Co. : 0.87 Kia Motors Corp. : 0.59 Daewoo Motor Co. : 0.20 Source : AUTOFACTS Inc. based in West Chester , Penn .
