   <HEADLINE> CSUF ' S CLEAN , BRIGHT IDEAS EARN IT A $ 1-MILLION REBATE ; CONSERVATION : INVESTMENT OF $ 6 MILLION TO MODERNIZE LIGHTING AND AIR CONDITIONING PAYS DIVIDEND ON FRIDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the last three years , Cal State Fullerton has carried_on a campaign to become as energy-efficient and non-polluting as possible , replacing fluorescent lights with longer-lasting illumination , renovating its air-conditioning system , and constructing a laboratory with a more efficient air-filtration system . The university spent $ 6 million to get most of the job done , but on Friday it will get some of that investment back . Southern California Edison Co . will present Cal State Fullerton a $ 1-million rebate , which is part of a program designed to encourage customers to make energy-saving , non-polluting changes . The rebate is one of the largest ever given by the energy company , said SCE officials . As a result of the project , the university will save 7.9 million kilowatt_hours -- enough electricity for about 1 # 500 houses a year -- and more_than $ 600 # 000 annually , said Jerry Keating , campus spokesman . &quot; In the long_haul , we recover the costs , &quot; he said . H . Fred Mickelson , regional general_manager of SCE , said the rebate program started in the late 1970s , &quot; when it became very apparent that the cost of building new power_plants was high enough that it made_sense to use energy more efficiently and pay rebates to encourage people to do that. &quot; In 1990 , after Cal State Fullerton had struggled with a 25-year-old air-conditioning system , university officials sat_down with SCE to discuss rebates and funding for the energy project , said Mickelson . Cal State Fullerton ' s $ 1-million rebate is the result of several phases of the energy-saving project , including : * Replacement of the lighting system in which , according to Corbett , &quot; virtually every light fixture on campus &quot; was replaced with newer versions at a cost of $ 2 million . The new fluorescent tubes are four times as efficient , last thousands of hours longer and do not contain carcinogens . Photo cells tell a computer when to activate outdoor lighting , rather than having them on all_the time . Edison is giving the campus a $ 200 # 000 rebate on the lighting project . * Installation of a $ 4-million cooling_system , including a storage_tank , which stores water from a chiller at night , when overall utility use is lower . Later , the water is piped to buildings to cool them . Edison is giving a $ 700 # 000 rebate for that system . * Construction of a laboratory facility , which was built with $ 20 million in voter-approved bonds , rather than with state-funded energy bonds . Corbett said the facility will not recirculate air because of concern about chemical emissions . The fumes go_through an exhaust_system and filter hoods . Edison gave a $ 50 # 000 rebate . Miscellaneous alterations account_for the remaining $ 50 # 000 in rebates , Corbett said . The project is not finished . More construction is starting on the first heat recovery storage system in Southern California , said Corbett . The system , scheduled for completion in November , will store waste heat from the chiller tanks used in the air conditioning system . This will eliminate the use of boilers , which waste more energy and emit noxious fumes . Edison ' s research division and the South Coast Air Quality Management District are supporting the $ 2.5-million project , Corbett said . SCE Vice_President Bob Bridenberker and Mickelson will present the rebate to Cal State Fullerton President Milton A . Gordon at the 2 p.m. ceremony in Langsdorf Hall . The ceremony will also honor the late Ed Knipe , chief of energy and utilities for the CSU system . Knipe helped push for state funding and is credited with much of the organizing of the energy-saving project . He died in March , 1992 , at the age of 43 . A plaque will be installed on campus in his name .</TEXT>
