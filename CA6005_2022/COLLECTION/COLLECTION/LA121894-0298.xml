   <HEADLINE> MANDELA ADMITS SLOWNESS OF REFORM , WARNS OF HASTE ; SOUTH_AFRICA : ALTHOUGH HE VOWS TO PROVIDE ' VISIBLE CHANGE , ' OTHERS SAY PRESIDENT IS ' WALKING A TIGHTROPE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The message was simple , and the setting supreme , for a guerrilla group turned democratic government . Here in the birthplace of the African National Congress , in a province that remains a stronghold of right-wing whites , President Nelson Mandela warned Saturday that his new government must provide &quot; visible change &quot; to improve people ' s lives next year . &quot; For , proud as we should be of the achievements made , the reality is that democratic forces in our country have captured only elements of political power , &quot; Mandela told the first ANC national conference since sweeping free elections nearly eight months ago . &quot; South_Africa is not yet out of the woods. &quot; Social change is too slow in coming , Mandela said , and new legislation to redress the wrongs of apartheid is taking &quot; longer than the situation demanded. &quot; He warned that the democratic revolution that ended statutory white_supremacy is not over . &quot; We have to contend with rear-guard resistance from the parties of apartheid and white privilege , from influential elements within the civil_service and the security Establishment , &quot; he said . Destabilizing agents are still present in &quot; the ANC and the rest of the democratic movement , universities , the media and other institutions , &quot; he added . Mandela also criticized the ANC , however , for the confusion that followed the election and the initial creation of democratic government structures . &quot; We were disorganized and behaved in a manner that could have endangered the revolution , &quot; he said . Mandela ' s 75-minute keynote_address drew raucous cheers , chants and songs from the 2 # 800 delegates in a hall at the University of the Orange Free_State . Whether his promise for concrete change is more_than rhetoric , however , remains to be seen . The slow pace of the government ' s ambitious five-year reconstruction and development program has less to do with political directives than the sobering reality of trying to transform a nation saddled with 50 % black unemployment and appalling inequalities in land , health_care , education and housing . And there is rising resentment from the mostly black ANC members , who argue that Mandela ' s fervent appeals for reconciliation with whites since the April election have blinded him to the immediate needs of disadvantaged blacks . &quot; There is a sense of impatience from the grass-roots level that delivery ( of tangible improvements ) is not taking_place fast enough , &quot; ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said . &quot; The message is we are overly concerned with the white community. &quot; But Niehaus said the ANC will not change its current economic or social_policies . &quot; The effect of moving too fast will be worse than moving too slow . The government is sticking_to its guns on that , &quot; he said . So far , at least , there has been little evidence that public discontent or disillusionment have threatened Mandela ' s remarkable popularity or the national consensus behind his leadership of a coalition government . Political violence has fallen sharply . Labor unrest , an unsettling mutiny by former ANC guerrillas , small-scale land invasions by urban squatters , continuing township rent boycotts and other problems have proved to be teething problems for the new democracy , rather than major crises . And growing criticism of several lackluster Cabinet_ministers has yet to rub_off on Mandela . A nationwide poll released last week , for example , showed his popularity not only remains astronomically high among blacks but has now risen substantially among whites . Support has fallen sharply , the poll found , for the once-mighty National Party headed by former President Frederik W . de Klerk , who has largely disappeared from public view in his role as deputy president under Mandela . But delegates said Mandela still faces a difficult challenge in the months ahead . &quot; He is walking a tightrope now , &quot; said Phakamisa Siyongwana , a 27-year-old delegate from Kwamagxaki in the Eastern Cape . &quot; On the one side is the right_wing . And on the other , the people ' s needs are urgent. &quot; Grantham Steenkamp , a delegate from Hopetown in the Northern Cape , warned that people ' s &quot; patience is wearing thin. &quot; &quot; I tell them what we need is time , &quot; he said . &quot; The apartheid government ruled for 40 years . The new government is ruling just seven months . Give us time. &quot; But another delegate , Marics Masoetsa , said time is running_out . &quot; Many people are feeling neglected and say they are being ignored by the people they put_in power , &quot; he said . &quot; They say the changes are too slow , and the leaders are too lenient with the whites who are resisting. &quot; At a press_conference in Johannesburg last week to launch his new autobiography , &quot; A Long Walk to Freedom , &quot; Mandela justified his attempts to assuage white fears to stem flight of capital and to avoid a violent backlash . &quot; We understand the criticism that we were paying_attention to the whites , &quot; he said . &quot; These people do not understand that the transition from white domination to democracy did not happen easily. &quot; Citing a &quot; clear danger of civil_war , &quot; he said , &quot; We had to tell the whites , ' You have nothing to fear from an ANC government. ' &quot; After taking_office in May , the government mandated a series of high-profile but relatively easy reforms , including feeding programs for schoolchildren , free medical_care for pregnant women and free education for children starting school next year . Under a new land restoration law , blacks have begun to reclaim and resettle land seized under apartheid . But in two recent visits to bleak squatter shantytowns , Mandela publicly acknowledged that he has yet to deliver the housing , jobs , water_projects and other tangible benefits promised during the election campaign . The cheering crowds appeared not to mind . The five-day ANC conference , which has the theme &quot; From Resistance to Reconstruction and Nation Building , &quot; will focus_on internal party matters and broad tactics and policies for the next three years . Most of the meetings are behind closed doors , and most major decisions have already been made . The delegates will elect a six-member national executive committee Monday . Few surprises are likely . Mandela is certain to be reelected ANC president , and Thabo Mbeki will be reelected deputy president . Mbeki is Mandela ' s second in command in government and his heir_apparent for the 1997 elections .</TEXT>
