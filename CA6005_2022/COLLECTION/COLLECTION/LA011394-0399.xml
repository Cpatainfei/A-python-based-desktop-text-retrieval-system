   <HEADLINE> 3-HOUR TOUR : KNOTT ' S GOTS LOTS TO DO AT ITS CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE , TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In these thrifty ' 90s , it ' s nice to know that you can check_out the birthplace of the boysenberry without paying_up to $ 25.95 a head in admission_fees . Knott ' s Berry Farm in Buena Park , which was the site of a 1930s fruit stand that popularized Rudolph Boysen ' s berry , maintains a section called California Marketplace that is open_to the public -- even the parking is free . The Marketplace is a collection of more_than 20 shops and restaurants , lined_up along a main_street , Grand Avenue , in the style of the Old West . And just across the way , through a tunnel that runs underneath Beach Boulevard , visitors can tour a replica of Philadelphia ' s Independence Hall . Noon to 12:30 : I headed to the back of the Marketplace area first , just to get a sense of how big it is . If you do this too , you can pick_up a map along the way at the information center . The back section holds a water_fountain surrounded in flowers and circled by several quaint shops . If you have small children with you , chances are you ' ll be drawn first in the direction of the Candy Parlour . This is the kind of place kids dream about . There are barrels filled with hard_candy and taffy . Tall cylinders of jellybeans hold exotic flavors such_as chocolate_pudding and ice blue mint and tangerine . For older kids , there are boxes of chocolates and candy gifts : a champagne bottle filled with jellybeans and a bouquet of lollipops in place of flowers . 12:30 to 1 : Next door is the Garden Terrace Cafe &amp; Bakery . Along with the baked_goods , this cafe serves sandwiches , coffee and soft_drinks . There are some umbrella-topped tables in front . The Garden Terrace serves usual bakery items ( doughnuts , muffins and oversized cookies ) and some unusual items . The blueberry cheesecake , almond raspberry tart and lemon mousse squares looked tempting . 1 to 1:30 : Across from the Garden Terrace is a store labeled simply Souvenir Shop . Here , you can get all sorts of Knott ' s memorabilia , from coffee_mugs to kitchen aprons to T-shirts stuffed into jelly jars . This shop also holds Knott ' s famed jellies and preserves . Lesser-known products bearing the Knott ' s label are salad_dressings , pickled things such_as a cucumber and onion mix , and flavored honey ( orange blossom , clover and buckwheat ) . 1:30 to 2 : Heading around the building , toward Grand Avenue , you ' ll spot another shop marked &quot; Souvenirs. &quot; This is actually the lower-brow half of Virginia ' s Gift_Shop , and it ' s the more fun half . I can never get enough of shops like this , and just a_few steps inside the entry way reminds me why . Ceramic chickens , with &quot; Knott ' s &quot; painted on their sides , hold a set of measuring spoons that stick_out from a hole where their tail feathers would be . Another reason to shop here is the Walter and Cordelia Knott memorial plate , with a photo of that famous founding couple . Finally , I spotted a refrigerator magnet in the shape of California with a valley quail superimposed over it . Very satisfying . The serious half of Virginia ' s Gift_Shop opens onto Grand Avenue . It contains portraits of John Wayne , collectible dolls , tiny ceramic animals and dinner_plate sets_in tasteful country patterns . 2 to 2:30 : As you head_up Grand Avenue , you ' ll pass Mrs . Knott ' s Chicken Dinner Restaurant , and , probably , a line of people waiting to get_in . If you want to taste the food without the wait , continue on and turn_in at Chicken to Go . Chicken to Go serves dinner combinations , much like Colonel Sanders . The Snack Box A , for example , holds two pieces of white_meat chicken , mashed potatoes with gravy , cole slaw , biscuits and boysenberry jam . Delicious . The price is $ 4.75. There ' s a kids meal , with Jello and a dinosaur cup , for $ 3.95 ; the 24-piece Bonanza Bucket is $ 26.95. There are a_few tables on site , or you can walk across the street and sit on a bench in front of the moccasin shop . 2:30 to 3 : A final stop , at the International MarketPlace store , takes shoppers from the American Southwest to Asia to Africa . The store is arranged by geographic_area and contains mostly souvenir-type merchandise . The Pacific Isles section , for example , holds seashells , shell jewelry and shell wind chimes . Bon voyage .
