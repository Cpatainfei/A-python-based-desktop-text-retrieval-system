   <HEADLINE> MANY UNHAPPY RETURNS ; COUPLES : TAX SEASON DRIVES OTHERWISE COMPATIBLE PARTNERS TO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE PERSONALITY SPECTRUM . THE RESULT ? DISPUTES THAT CAN BE TAXING INDEED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The window panes quiver . The door jambs shudder . The neighbors cover their ears and mutter , &quot; Oh no , they ' re at it again. &quot; No need to feel ashamed . You are merely in the midst of your annual tax fight -- an imbroglio waged by countless couples who see the 1040 form as a declaration of domestic war . Faced with the prospect of assessing the year ' s financial adventures , &quot; people revert to their oldest , most dysfunctional forms of behavior , &quot; said Washington , D.C. , psychotherapist Olivia Mellan , author of &quot; Money Harmony. &quot; Meaning that they act like children ? &quot; Exactly , &quot; Mellan said . Couples bicker about record-keeping , said Richard Cassidy , a Brentwood accountant . They argue over who wants to stretch a particular deduction . They shout about profligacy , such_as his Argentine fly-fishing expeditions or her passion for expensive shoes . They fume over financial priorities , and liabilities . It ' s moment-of-truth time for some couples , when they find_out how much -- or how little -- their partner earned in the past year . If taxes are owed , they may spar over where to get the funds . If a refund is_due , they may tangle over what to do with the windfall . Sometimes , Cassidy has observed , one spouse uses tax time as an opportunity to demonstrate his or her superior financial sophistication -- an occasion , in short , to make the other spouse feel stupid . Or , there is the hidden bank_account explosion : the bomb that detonates when one partner finds_out that the other has squirreled away a secret slush_fund . But experts agree that what all this fighting is really about is power . Tax time activates some primal struggle for many otherwise normal adults . Couples who appear perfectly peaceable the rest of the year turn_into full-assault combatants . All it takes is one little document from Uncle_Sam , and the monetary machine-guns come_out in the open . &quot; It ' s not just the taxes , &quot; said Cassidy , who thinks_of himself at this time of the year as a full-time accountant and part-time marriage counselor . &quot; There ' s no way anyone could get that heated_up over taxes. &quot; But don ' t tell that to Jane , a Riverside office manager who said she recently stopped speaking_to her husband because of a tax battle . Feverish doesn ' t even come_close to describing the mood between Jane and Frank , who threatened bodily harm if their actual names were used . &quot; We ' re at war right now , &quot; said Jane , who went ballistic when she learned that Frank , an independent contractor , had somehow &quot; forgotten &quot; to pay his quarterly tax installments for the last_half of 1993 . &quot; My life has been sheer misery , &quot; Jane raged . &quot; Frank is a very good_person , but he is not good when it comes_to taxes. &quot; * Or there is Shelley , who would allow herself to be described only as working &quot; in the nonprofit world &quot; in New York City . Shelley has a doctorate from the University of Chicago , an attainment her husband , Bob , loves to taunt her with every year when he blasts her for her sloppy accounting habits . &quot; He ' s a fastidious record-keeper , &quot; Shelley said of Bob , a dentist . &quot; I hardly balance my checkbook. &quot; She paused . &quot; In fact , I don ' t balance my checkbook. &quot; Crossing swords over capital assets ( or , for that matter , debits ) is something of a national pastime , said Howard Markman , director of the University of Denver ' s Center for Marital and Family Studies . &quot; It does turn_out in our research that money is the No . 1 issue that couples fight about , &quot; said Markman , who addresses tax tiffs in his book , &quot; We Can Work It Out. &quot; Money acts_as a magnet , Markman said , drawing_out all kinds of other issues that couples may have been avoiding . In particular , he said , &quot; there ' s often a lot of anger buried under money. &quot; At tax time , said Dr. Bonnie Maslin , a New York City psychologist who is the author of &quot; The Angry Marriage , &quot; such enmity becomes even more pronounced . Clashes in personal management styles are often exaggerated where money and taxes are concerned , she said , citing the &quot; NBD &quot; -- for No Big Deal -- conflict as a prime example . &quot; that ' s where you have one spouse who says taxes are not important -- ' it ' s no big deal to me , ' &quot; Maslin said . &quot; Just today I talked to a woman whose husband was flipping out because if she had had certain papers , they could have saved $ 300 on their taxes . Meanwhile , she ' s shrugging and saying , ' Oh come_on , it ' s only $ 300 , it ' s no big deal. ' &quot; Maslin said she has also encountered marriages where one spouse is a chronic risk-taker and the other is a confirmed risk-avoider . &quot; I know someone who says ' I ' m not happy unless the IRS audits me , ' &quot; Maslin said . While this man is relishing the challenge of beating the government at its own penny-ante game , &quot; the wife is terrified of an audit. &quot; * Tax time also brings_out the worst in what Maslin calls the &quot; Odd Couple &quot; marriage , &quot; where you have a procrastinator married to someone who is always on top of things. &quot; By postponing his or her portion of the tax preparation , &quot; one spouse just passively drives the other one crazy , &quot; Maslin said . Focusing almost exclusively on money problems among couples , psychotherapist Mellan has come_up with her own set of oppositional tax forces . Most common are hoarder versus spender marriages , she said , followed closely by worrier versus avoider , planner versus dreamer and money merger versus money separator . Any of those combinations makes_for domestic pyrotechnics when tax time rolls_around , Mellan said . &quot; What happens is that any polarized behaviors you have already developed are exaggerated , &quot; she said . As in any trusted battle strategy , habit sets_in , and when April 15 looms close , &quot; A lot of the time , people just have the same fight again and again and again , &quot; Mellan said . So common are these disagreements that Van Nuys accountant Michael Bernstein sometimes considers attaching a therapy fee to his standard charge for tax preparation . Fortunately , Bernstein said : &quot; They usually have a fight after their appointment , when they find_out what they owe -- not so often in my office. &quot; Still , Brentwood accountant Cassidy said he has witnessed a_few near knock-down , drag-out tax fights . &quot; Especially when one spouse completely disagrees_with the other , &quot; he said . &quot; Or when one of them doesn ' t keep the records and just expects the other one to solve all_the problems. &quot; * Maybe so , but some spouses advocate tax abdication as the best tactic of all . Tracy Thomas , a graphic_artist in Culver City , said that in the tax preparation department , he has &quot; willingly acquiesced &quot; to his wife and business partner , Pam . &quot; Pam ' s the warrior on our personal taxes , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; She ' s the one who organizes all that garbage . I lose patience , and my accounting_system is basically to throw all_the stuff into a drawer. &quot; Recently transplanted from Los Angeles to Portland , Ore. , writers Heidi Yorkshire and Joe Anthony have managed to avoid tax conflagrations in their two years of marriage . Maybe that ' s because both are galled by one particular feature of Uncle_Sam ' s idea of family values . &quot; The marriage penalty just drives us crazy , &quot; Yorkshire said . &quot; We do consider getting divorced and not telling anybody , except the government. &quot;</TEXT>
