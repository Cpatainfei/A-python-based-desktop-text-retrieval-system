   <HEADLINE> CULTURAL DEFENSE IN WIFE ' S DEATH ; COURTS : ATTORNEY SAYS IRANIAN IMMIGRANT SNAPPED BECAUSE HIS SPOUSE CHALLENGED HIS MANHOOD . BUT PROSECUTION PORTRAYS HIM AS A CALCULATED KILLER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trapped by his culture in a dysfunctional marriage and psychologically abused for decades , Iranian immigrant Moosa Hanoukai snapped and killed his wife in a crime of passion , his defense_attorney said Thursday . But at the opening of Hanoukai ' s trial in Van Nuys Superior_Court , prosecutors portrayed him as a calculating killer who deserves life in prison . At stake is whether Hanoukai , 55 , spends the rest of life behind bars or is guilty of manslaughter , which carries a maximum penalty of 11 years in prison . Defense_attorney James E . Blatt said he will use a cultural defense and show that Hanoukai ' s wife challenged her husband ' s manhood for 25 years . Browbeaten by his wife , forced to sleep on the floor and prevented from getting a divorce , Hanoukai erupted at his Woodland Hills home March 20 , 1993 , Blatt said . &quot; The defense considers this case a tragedy of a married_couple involved in a dysfunctional relationship , &quot; Blatt said . &quot; Due_to cultural and religious grounds , they were unable to get a divorce. &quot; The relationship , he added , &quot; finally ended in a night of tragic violence. &quot; Although he apparently tried to cover_up the slaying , Hanoukai soon confessed to an acquaintance that he bludgeoned his wife , Manijeh , prosecutors said . Blatt said he plans to present evidence showing that Manijeh Hanoukai violated norms of the tightly_knit Iranian Jewish community of which she and her husband were members , and will show the psychological abuse Hanoukai endured . &quot; The defense is confident that we can present our witnesses and this homicide will be shown to be a manslaughter -- that it was in the heat of passion , that it was not premeditated or with malice , &quot; Blatt said . In her opening statement , Deputy Dist . Atty . Kathleen M . Cady painted_a_picture of a man who went_out of control after a domestic dispute . &quot; Her injuries were many skull fractures , &quot; Cady said , describing the beating the victim received . &quot; She died because her body lost so_much blood. &quot; An autopsy determined that Manijeh Hanoukai died of blunt-force trauma to the head , but no murder weapon was found , authorities said . The prosecutor promised the jurors that they would hear testimony indicating that after beating his 100-pound wife to death , Hanoukai completely dressed the corpse , stuffed it in a trash bag and left it in the garage of their Margarita Drive_home . While admitting the couple had a stormy relationship , Cady said Hanoukai would not turn himself in to police until he had consulted an Iranian attorney . The couple ' s 25-year-old daughter , Delaram , testified that her parents were unhappy throughout their relationship , and that her mother controlled the family ' s finances . Police have said that Manijeh Hanoukai controlled several bank_accounts -- totaling well_over $ 200 # 000 -- and her daughter was named as the beneficiary of the bank_deposits and a life_insurance policy . Delaram Hanoukai told the jury about one fight between her parents in the family ' s Huntington Park clothing_store , where Moosa Hanoukai shook his wife and threatened &quot; to smash her head. &quot;</TEXT>
