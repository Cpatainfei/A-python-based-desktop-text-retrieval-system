   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : FOREIGN STOCKS MAY BE POISED FOR GROWTH SPURT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many of the world ' s emerging stock_markets are bouncing_back , after losing 20 % or more of their value in recent months . Some Wall Streeters think it ' s time to buy . Markets from Chile to Thailand to Turkey were red-hot last year as Americans were reawakened to the potential in foreign stocks , especially those of developing nations . Hong Kong shares , for example , rose 116 % last year on average , Taiwan shares 80 % and Mexican shares 48 % . But the avalanche of cash into those still-illiquid markets produced wild overvaluations in many stocks by year ' s end . Ripe for selling , emerging markets needed only a small push to fall_off the cliff -- and they got that when the Federal_Reserve_Board began raising interest_rates on Feb . 4 , causing a ripple effect worldwide . This week , however , the Fed ' s fourth rate hike of the year was the catalyst for a rally in many markets , rather than another decline . The reason : The Fed indicated that it ' s done tightening credit for now , removing the specter of a new surge in rates that could jeopardize global growth . &quot; What we ' ve seen is a ' sigh of relief ' rally &quot; in emerging markets , says Jay Pelosky , Latin_America stock strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co . While the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 2.7 % so far this week , Mexico ' s Bolsa stock index has leaped 7.4 % . Hong Kong ' s Hang Seng index is up 5.3 % over the past seven days . And Argentine stocks have advanced for six straight sessions , rising 2.8 % on Thursday alone . Some markets have been helped by more_than the Fed . In Brazil , the Sao Paulo stock_exchange index zoomed 12.1 % on Thursday after the country ' s congress OKd the second phase of the government ' s economic reform plan , which is designed to end Brazil ' s crippling hyperinflation . And in Mexico , the poor showing of the ruling party ' s chief rival in a presidential debate last week gave investors more reason to feel optimistic about the outcome of the August election . Indeed , in most emerging markets the problems dogging stocks this year have been largely political or technical , many Wall Streeters say . ( Technical in the sense that heavy profit taking_in illiquid stocks can depress prices more_than is justified. ) The fundamentals of developing nations ' economies , meanwhile , have generally remained healthy -- a function of the U.S. economy ' s strong expansion and the nascent recovery in Europe . If investors begin to focus once again on growth rather than interest_rates , cash should continue to move_back into emerging-market stocks , argues Dan Duane , head of Prudential ' s Pacific Growth fund . &quot; The whole story from now on will be where the earnings momentum is , &quot; he says . One of Duane ' s favorite markets today is South_Korea , which he figures will show real economic_growth of 6 % this year and corporate profit growth of 20 % or better . The risk of war with the North notwithstanding , South_Korea is fast supplanting Japan as a supplier of electronics and other manufactured goods to Europe , Duane says . Scott Kalb , Latin stock specialist at Smith Barney Shearson , this week urged clients to jump back into Argentine stocks . With the threat of more Fed rate hikes removed at least for now , Kalb expects global investors to be drawn to Argentina ' s expected growth_rate of 4.5 % to 5 % this year , low inflation and political stability . But are emerging-market stocks cheap relative to earnings ? The bulls say yes , but that depends_on your idea of &quot; cheap. &quot; In any case , it ' s at least true that the declines in many markets since January have produced more reasonable stock prices worldwide . You ' re more likely to be paying 15 to 20 times ' 94 earnings today than 20 to 25 times . Even so , playing one-country stock funds , or funds of specific regions , is probably best left to traders or to investors with high risk tolerance , because of the volatility in such narrowly focused investments . Most investors would probably be best off in a widely diversified global fund . David Herro , manager of the Oakmark International stock fund , argues that the bigger risk today isn ' t overpaying for foreign stocks , but underestimating their long-term potential . &quot; I think this is one of the great buying opportunities , &quot; he insists . As he travels the world , Herro says , he sees capitalism blooming all_over . &quot; People everywhere just want to go_out and do something , &quot; he says . Third_World Rebound Shares of many Latin_American and Asian companies , and funds that invest in those stocks , have been climbing sharply from lows reached earlier this spring . 03 # 25 , 16 # 16 1994 Thurs . close Stock high-low and change Argentina Fund 19 5 / 8-12 5 / 8 15 5 / 8 , + 3 / 8 Banca de Galicia ( Arg. ) 45 5 / 8-24 7 / 8 38 1 / 2 , + 1 1 / 8 Brazil Fund 31 3 / 4-18 3 / 4 23 , + 2 Comp . de Telef .
