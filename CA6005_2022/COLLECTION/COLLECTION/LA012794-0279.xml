   <HEADLINE> BAR PRESIDENT SWINGS AT ' THREE STRIKES ' CRIME PROVISION ; LAW : HE CALLS IT A POLITICAL ' QUICK_FIX ' THAT WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT ON CURBING URBAN VIOLENCE . LONG-RANGE SOLUTIONS ARE BACKED AT CONFERENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration ' s call_for life imprisonment for three-time violent offenders is a political quick_fix that would have no effect on the crime_rate , American Bar Assn . President R . William Ide said Wednesday . Ide called_for a change in direction toward greater local involvement in crime-fighting . His comments opened a two-day conference designed to slow_down or stall the growing White_House and congressional support for stiffer mandatory sentences . Lawmakers applauded President Clinton during his State of the Union speech Tuesday night when he advocated swift congressional approval of a crime bill -- including the popular &quot; three-strikes-and-you ' re out &quot; provision already passed_by the Senate . The House Judiciary Committee is expected to hold hearings on its own version of the measure next month , with Senate-House negotiations likely to lead to a final bill . &quot; The quick-fix frenzy has captured our political leadership , &quot; Ide told an audience of law_enforcement specialists from 29 national organizations . &quot; It ' s understandable that Congress wants to be seen as tough on crime in a political year . . . but federalization of crimes that belong in state jurisdictions is posturing and not a long-range solution to violent crime. &quot; Provisions of the crime legislation would add_to a growing list of violence- or drug-related offenses that Congress has given federal authorities power to prosecute . Such crimes historically have been the purview of local and state authorities . Ide asked Congress and the Administration to consider whether the so-called &quot; three-time-loser &quot; provision would be &quot; just another politically palatable quick_fix . . . or will this new idea be the straw that breaks the back of our overburdened criminal justice system. &quot; Deputy Atty . Gen . Philip B . Heymann , who also spoke at the conference , said that the Justice_Department was examining the Senate-approved provision to see what crimes would trigger a life sentence and whether it should apply to offenses committed by juveniles . But he said that the law would require life in prison without parole , without exceptions , for those sentenced under such a procedure . &quot; The whole purpose of this is to send a clear signal &quot; to potential offenders , Heymann said . In his address , Ide said that the Senate ' s classification of handgun murders as federal crimes and approval of mandatory federal penalties for using a handgun might be self-defeating . Mandatory minimum sentencing , he pointed_out , has already filled prisons to capacity , forcing authorities to grant other violent offenders early release . Ide said that the United States has 1.3 million people in prison or jail_cells -- more_than any other country in the world -- with very little impact on crime_rates over the past decade . James Fyfe , a former New York City police_officer who is now professor of criminal justice at Temple University , also criticized the &quot; three-time-loser &quot; proposal on grounds that the third crime must be subject_to federal jurisdiction , which does not now cover most street crimes . &quot; It really doesn ' t do much for the little old_lady worried about crime in the streets , &quot; Fyfe said . &quot; There ' s an awful lot of posturing going_on . &quot; We have to ask some very tough questions of politicians , especially at the federal level , and get them to address root causes ( of crime ) , &quot; he added . Ide also questioned how Clinton ' s plan to put another 100 # 000 police_officers on the streets would impact state prosecutors , courts and prisons . &quot; Where are the resources to try the accused ? &quot; Ide asked . &quot; Where are the resources to house the convicted ? &quot; Ide advocated greater emphasis on crime prevention , along with imprisonment of career criminals by mobilizing local police , prosecutors , judges , treatment specialists , parole officers and community organizations into crime-fighting coalitions . &quot; Violent crime is a community problem that must be solved through community involvement , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
