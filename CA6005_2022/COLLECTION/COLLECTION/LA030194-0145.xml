   <HEADLINE> SPORTS MOGUL MCNALL ' S GOLDEN TOUCH LOSES LUSTER ; BUSINESS : HE TURNED L.A. ON TO HOCKEY . BUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SUGGEST THAT HE MAY HAVE HIT HIS LIMITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From an Arcadia high_school student who made money trading Roman coins to a sports mogul whose Los Angeles Kings nearly won professional hockey ' s Stanley Cup last year , Bruce P . McNall has projected an image of glittery success . With his open checkbook McNall spent millions to lure such star athletes as Wayne Gretzky to his Kings and former Notre Dame star Raghib ( Rocket ) Ismail to his Canadian football_team , the Toronto Argonauts . McNall brought Hollywood to hockey , schmoozing at games with the_likes_of actress Goldie Hawn , actor James Woods and former President Ronald Reagan . Along the way , the beefy , wisecracking , personable McNall was lauded as a wildly successful sports entrepreneur whose popularity and spending knew no bounds . But recent developments suggest that McNall may have hit some limits . In December , he announced a deal involving new investors to whom he will sell a majority interest in his treasured Kings -- a move once considered unthinkable -- largely to pay_off a bank loan . The exact percentage has not been disclosed publicly , but sources with knowledge of the deal told The Times that McNall is selling 65 % of the franchise . The impending sale of part of the Kings has stirred interest in McNall ' s financial well-being . McNall , 43 , said &quot; there are no problems &quot; with his finances and that he is eagerly looking_forward to building an arena for the Kings that may be shared with the Lakers . He said he is the victim of negative rumors orchestrated by unidentified parties who would like to see the Kings deal fall_apart &quot; for their own benefit and profit. &quot; Separating the fact from rumor , it is easy to see that McNall has had a rather challenging year . For example : * He helped engineer a deal that brought a National Hockey_League team to Orange County this season . He will receive $ 25 million over several years for giving_up exclusivity in the Los Angeles area . * Creditors sued him after he allegedly defaulted_on a bank loan and failed to pay a Hollywood studio that alleged he owed money . * A business partner filed a lawsuit charging that McNall improperly used company money for other ventures . * His dream of bringing championship hockey to Los Angeles was realized when the Kings played in the Stanley Cup_finals . * His rare coin business , which does_well in inflationary and boom times , has fallen prey to the soft national economy . Add_to all this the money-losing Canadian football_team , a steep debt level and a Forum lease that limits McNall ' s ability to profit from the Kings ' popularity and you have an atmosphere worthy of closer examination . Selling the Kings McNall and his lawyers are working hard to close the $ 60-million agreement to sell the controlling interest in the Kings . The buyers are Los Angeles telecommunications entrepreneur Jeffrey Sudikoff and his associate , Joseph Cohen . McNall chose Sudikoff , chief_executive of IDB Communications , over an affiliate of Sony Corp . Sony only wanted to buy a minority interest in the Kings , as well as a piece of the Lakers basketball_team from owner Jerry Buss . The tentative deal says a lot about the changing fortunes of someone who was lecturing audiences three years ago for $ 48 a head on &quot; Turning Your Passions Into Profits. &quot; He will soon be left with a much smaller piece of his most passionate investment , the Kings . As recently as last season , McNall said he would not consider selling them . Under a clause in the complex deal , sources said , McNall conceivably could buy back_up to 80 % of the Kings on favorable terms if an arena is ever built , although Sudikoff and his partner would own most of the arena . There are signs that McNall may be unable to continue calling all_the shots for the Kings as he does now . Both McNall and Sudikoff said McNall will continue to run the team as something of a managing partner even after the deal is completed . But Sudikoff said in an interview he won ' t be a passive partner . &quot; I ' m definitely an interested investor . I ' m not just a financial investor . I ' m not doing this because I think it ' s fun , &quot; he said . McNall said the partial sale is necessary to help him achieve a longtime goal of building a $ 150-million state-of-the-art arena in the Los Angeles area that gives the Kings more revenue opportunities than they have at the 27-year-old Forum . The sale also would give McNall financial breathing_room . The heart of the sale involves helping McNall shed his biggest creditor , Bank of America , which had agreed to extend up_to $ 90 million in loans and credit to McNall ' s operations . Banking sources , creditors and people close to McNall confirm that McNall ' s business predicaments prompted Bank of America executives recently to move his loan to an internal special assets unit , which specializes in handling loans that are of special concern to the bank . Banking sources say such a move is no small matter and indicates that B of A executives are concerned about the prospects of the loan being repaid . The bank is expected to receive most , if not all , of the $ 60 million that Sudikoff is paying and possibly a part ownership in the new arena , if it is built . A McNall lawyer said that when the Kings ' deal is completed , McNall will be free_of the Bank of America loan . McNall and his aides said they have an &quot; excellent relationship &quot; with the bank . A McNall spokesman said that McNall officials have received no notice &quot; of any change in the status of our account &quot; and &quot; want to make_it clear that we are not in default. &quot; A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment , citing company policy about discussing specific customers . The Lawsuits McNall has a variety of other business and creditor problems , including these recent predicaments detailed in public records : * McNall , who in the past has represented his net worth at as much as $ 200 million , was sued last October by Torrance-based Republic Bank for defaulting_on a loan requiring him to pay $ 1.875 million last May . In a sworn statement , Republic Vice_President Lee Marzahl refers to McNall ' s &quot; apparent illiquidity , &quot; or the inability to convert assets quickly into cash . McNall said he was not aware of the Republic loan default until The Times asked him about it . He sees it as a minor amount_of_money for him -- roughly the same as recently reacquired Kings ' defenseman Marty McSorley makes in a season -- and denies that he is experiencing liquidity problems . A settlement is pending . * Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox has obtained a court_order attaching a lien on McNall ' s assets , alleging that McNall is 17 months late in paying $ 4.5 million the studio said he owes . The money in_question stems from the failure of &quot; Mannequin II , &quot; a movie that Fox released for Gladden Entertainment , a production company McNall owns with former Columbia Pictures studio chief David Begelman that has produced such films as &quot; The Fabulous Baker Boys &quot; and &quot; WarGames. &quot; Suzan A . Waks , McNall ' s vice_chairman and chief financial_officer , said McNall is suing Fox as well for allegedly mishandling the film ' s release . She called Fox ' s court_order &quot; a negotiating ploy with Bruce &quot; and said that McNall &quot; has a very good relationship with the people at Fox despite the fact they ' ve been arguing back and forth. &quot; * A coin partnership organized through Merrill Lynch by McNall called Athena II is also faltering . Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that the fund lost $ 9.2 million in the first nine months of last year as the value of the fund ' s coins plunged . SEC documents list the equity of limited partners in the venture as tumbling from $ 17.5 million at the start of last year to $ 8.5 million Sept . 30 , a drop of more_than 50 % . McNall acknowledges that the coin market has been slow , but said it is improving . He said Athena made money for investors early on , adding that he chose to liquidate it so investors ' money would not be eaten_away by overhead costs to run the fund . * McNall was named in a lawsuit filed last month by his partners at Superior Stamp &amp; Coin in Beverly Hills , one of the nation ' s top auction_houses and traders in rare coins , stamps , antiques and memorabilia . Co-Presidents Ira and Lawrence Goldberg alleged in a recently settled lawsuit that McNall used $ 4.6 million from a bank credit_line because he &quot; desperately needed funds to maintain his other ventures and his extraordinary life style. &quot; Ira Goldberg alleged in a sworn statement that McNall &quot; falsified Superior ' s 1993 year-end inventory statement with the intent to mislead Superior ' s auditors and the Bank of California &quot; by listing as Superior inventory -- and therefore as collateral -- coins that Goldberg said belonged_to a McNall-organized coin fund . It was also alleged in the lawsuit that McNall overvalued a personal stamp_collection that served as collateral for a bank loan . Neither McNall nor the Goldbergs are allowed to discuss the terms of their settlement , although it is believed that McNall and the Goldbergs are severing their business ties . Before the lawsuit was settled , McNall called it &quot; a desperate move_on their part to save a failing business &quot; the Goldbergs were running , further alleging that they resisted such moves as cutting their salaries . As to Ira Goldberg ' s accusations , McNall lawyer Kenneth N . Klee said that the Goldbergs ' lawsuit was filled with &quot; inflammatory statements capable of being misconstrued. &quot; Last week , the Goldbergs sent a letter to The Times saying that their allegations &quot; should not be regarded_as proven facts. &quot; They added that they &quot; have both personal affection and great respect &quot; for McNall and do not want to see him harmed by the allegations they have made . McNall believes that talk_about possible business difficulties may have been sparked by a decision to hire Klee , one of the nation ' s top bankruptcy lawyers at Stutman , Treister &amp; Glatt in Los Angeles . McNall and Klee said there are no plans in the works calling_for McNall to seek protection in bankruptcy court . McNall added that he hired Klee not for his bankruptcy expertise , but because &quot; he ' s the best negotiator I know. &quot; Klee clearly strengthens McNall ' s hand at the bargaining table , according to people who have been dealing with him . Klee has played important roles in some of the nation ' s biggest bankruptcy cases , such_as Texaco . Klee ' s mere presence implies that McNall has the ability to file for bankruptcy court protection . Court records in the Superior Stamp &amp; Coin case show that an order was entered barring McNall from forcing Superior into bankruptcy . The Image McNall has clearly revived the Kings , which he bought_into in 1986 and took_control of two years later from former owner Buss . Before the Kings , McNall was a little-known Beverly Hills coin_collector and racehorse owner , where he enjoyed some success in the 1980s . Largely through the 1988 acquisition of superstar Gretzky , McNall turned an indifferent Los Angeles on to the sport . McNall built the Kings from a team losing an estimated $ 5 million annually before he bought_it to one that last year netted an estimated $ 2 million , aided by playoff revenue . Once lucky to sell_out the Forum , the Kings this season are selling about 95 % of the seats at_home games , more often than not selling all 16 # 005 seats even with their playoff hopes fading . As the Kings ' popularity increased , the gregarious McNall has become something of a celebrity , in contrast to other Los Angeles sports team owners who often shun the limelight . In near 90-degree heat last summer , McNall , dressed as usual in a dark suit , appeared at Magic Mountain in Valencia at an event honoring the Kings . He stood_for the brief presentation and signed autographs for the better part of half an hour in the sweltering sun . McNall also marketed the team in a way that substantially boosted sales of such items as Kings shirts and caps , changing the colors from a garish purple and gold to a trendier silver and black . All told , the team , which McNall spent about $ 20 million to acquire , would have an indicated value of about $ 100 million based on the pending transaction . McNall also climbed meteorically within hockey circles , and was elected in 1992 to the powerful post of chairman of the National Hockey_League ' s board of governors . In that post , he helped the NHL shed its blue-collar image by wooing to the league such prominent executives as Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael D . Eisner of Anaheim ' s Mighty Ducks and Blockbuster Video tycoon H . Wayne Huizenga of the Florida Panthers . McNall also became popular_with the press , which enjoyed his playfulness , quips and spontaneity . After buying the Kings , McNall suggested that someone shoot him if he ever started acting like notoriously autocratic New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner . After a Kings ' victory in the playoffs last spring , McNall grabbed a reporter ' s note pad and pen and yelled from the back of the room at head coach Barry Melrose : &quot; Coach ! You earned your salary tonight , right ? &quot; Even while feeling the pressure of business difficulties , he has maintained a sense_of_humor . Last month , McNall abruptly began walking up and down the aisle , soliciting dollar_bills from reporters in the middle of a news_conference marking McSorley ' s return , joking that he needed the money . As the Kings prospered , however , McNall has grown more restless . He is locked into a long-term lease with the Forum and Lakers owner Buss that gives Buss a lucrative chunk of concession sales , parking fees and &quot; Senate &quot; seat packages often bought by businesses . McNall ' s limited potential to make money off the Kings is driving his desire for a new arena . Sources familiar_with the Kings estimate that McNall spends about $ 100 # 000 a game paying Buss a percentage of ticket sales , rent and other costs . McNall believed that he could turn_around the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football_League in much the same way he did the Kings . He and his partners -- Gretzky and actor John Candy -- have sunk about $ 22.5 million into the Toronto team since 1991 . McNall , in a four-year , $ 18.2-million personal services_contract , signed Ismail , who now plays for the Los Angeles Raiders . Such moves generated plenty of publicity , but no profit . The Argonauts , through the fall and most of the winter , were in default for rent to the Toronto SkyDome , where it plays . The team made_good last month on about $ 300 # 000 in back rent . SkyDome President Richard Peddie said the payments came only after considerable pressure was applied . One player , who was eventually paid as promised the $ 25 # 000 he was owed , was so concerned about the rumors of team problems said that he camped_out for a week in January in the Argonauts ' lobby , serving doughnuts to the team staff while waiting for his check . McNall said he would entertain offers for the football_team , but denies that the team has been_on the market and insists that he wants to retain a piece of the team no matter what happens . Sources close to his other partners , however , say the entire team has been openly shopped around for as much as $ 8 million . Whatever the sale price , McNall and his partners still must settle up with the team ' s previous owner , Hollywood Park Vice_Chairman Harry Ornest , who holds a note of about $ 2.5 million stemming from the 1991 transaction . Slowness in payments is not necessarily a sign of trouble for a company . Even some robust business owners are slow in paying bills as part of a hardball strategy in managing cash . McNall has seemingly tested the patience of some creditors , the SkyDome being one . The Kings have even been late in paying one of its hockey_stick suppliers , the Canadian manufacturer Sherwood , which is known to have twice put a hold_on shipments to the Kings before Sherwood was paid about $ 30 # 000 . Asked about Sherwood , McNall said that there is &quot; nothing that is extraordinarily late &quot; in terms of unpaid bills for the Kings . McNall ' s problems might reflect a typical high-flying 1980s entrepreneur encountering tougher times in the 1990s , if it were not for a carefully cultivated image that has portrayed him as an overachieving Midas . The son of a USC biochemistry professor and a laboratory technician , McNall grew_up in Arcadia , later saying he developed a fascination with rare coins in grade_school . The 1966 Arcadia High_School yearbook pictures him as president of the school ' s coin club . It is_after high_school that McNall ' s story gets cloudy , and records suggest that McNall and his staff are guilty of a good amount of hyperbole over the years . His official Kings biography said that he zoomed through UCLA in three years starting at 16 , graduating with his bachelor ' s degree at a remarkably early age of 19 . A UCLA spokesman said school records list him as graduating in 1972 at age 22 . Asked about the discrepancy between his UCLA claims and school records , McNall said : &quot; I went_through UCLA quickly . I ended_up being a ( teaching assistant ) prior to graduating and got a Regents Fellowship and the next step was going_on to a doctorate . I honestly can ' t remember the precise date of all that. &quot; He added : &quot; I don ' t sit there and look_at the Kings ' bio records . I probably should , frankly. &quot; McNall called this and other past challenges to his biography technical differences misinterpreted by reporters . Other challenges have came from Forbes magazine , which in 1991 disputed McNall ' s Oxford studies claim as well as some_other key business boasts . &quot; These legends just get greater and greater . They ' re just not correct , &quot; Forbes quoted McNall as saying when asked about the claims . McNall ' s net worth also has been a source of considerable controversy . McNall has said he is worth &quot; $ 150 million to $ 200 million , &quot; as he was quoted by The Times in 1989 , to &quot; hundreds of millions &quot; of dollars , as he was quoted as saying to Business Week in 1991 . The Superior Stamp &amp; Coin lawsuit alleges that in 1989 McNall stated his assets at a considerably lower amount when he bought a 51 % stake in the business . The papers said McNall said his assets &quot; exceeded $ 40 million and that his current assets exceeded current liabilities by $ 20 million. &quot; Forbes once concluded that McNall was worth only a fraction of what he claimed . McNall said he still is worth a substantial amount_of_money , but will not say how much . Explaining why his net worth was always reported high , McNall said : &quot; Probably what happened was that the reporter said to me , ' All right , is it true you are worth $ 100 or $ 150 or $ 200 million ? ' I ' ve always said I have no idea. &quot; McNall also acknowledged that he is very much a salesman and sometimes gets carried_away in telling stories . Besides , he said , it is not so bad in the collectibles and horse_racing business if people think you have more money than you really do because people offer you more deals . McNall and his advisers admit that he is a soft_touch . McNall has one business tendency his advisers are trying to cure him of him , that of routinely guaranteeing loans and payments personally when it may_not be necessary . That puts McNall on_the_hook personally if the person or company cannot pay it back . McNall calls it &quot; a character flaw. &quot; Vice_Chairman Waks said she &quot; took his pen away. &quot; McNall said : &quot; I ' ve had various partners and I ' ve put a lot of faith in them . When they ask me to do something , all too often I guess I ' ve said yes . My advisers over the many years said , ' You shouldn ' t be doing that. ' &quot; McNall traces some of his current problems to an image that he said was too inflated to begin with . &quot; The world always builds you up and then it ' s more fun to try to tear it down , &quot; McNall said . &quot; In a way , in my eyes , I was never as successful as the public made me to be . And certainly today , not nearly in the position as possibly others made me to be . It ' s the nature of the beast , in a way. &quot;</TEXT>
