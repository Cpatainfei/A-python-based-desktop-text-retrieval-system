   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; O.C. DOOMSAYER TRANSFORMED INTO A VISIONARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He doesn ' t seem like a prophet of doom , especially not when he ' s wearing his Mickey_Mouse &quot; Leader of the Club &quot; tie -- as he was_on his birthday last week -- and driving his gull-winged Bricklin to a triumphal speech at the local Rotary_Club . In fact , John M . W . Moorlach seems almost giddy as he steps to the podium to remind his appreciative audience that he warned them during the spring that Orange County ' s treasurer was taking enormous risks with the public ' s money . &quot; I couldn ' t believe how right I was , &quot; Moorlach says , hunching toward the microphone and reflecting on an interview he gave just before the county declared bankruptcy Dec . 6 . What ' s more , he said , after rereading an eight-page , doomsday letter he sent to County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley on May 31 , he realized that his dire prediction about the county ' s future &quot; wasn ' t just kind of close . It looked_like I wrote it yesterday ! &quot; Nearly three weeks after Orange County ' s extraordinary plunge into bankruptcy , Moorlach ' s personal and political stock is soaring on the strength of how right he was . He is pondering his suddenly bright future as a candidate for office and fielding nearly nonstop phone_calls from reporters , friends and admirers across the country . Should Moorlach run_for the state Senate seat being vacated next month by Marian Bergeson ? Or should he hope that the Board of Supervisors will decide next spring to replace disgraced former Treasurer Robert L . Citron with Moorlach , who predicted Orange County ' s financial collapse ? Although Thomas L . Daxon , a former Oklahoma finance director , was appointed last week to an interim , four-month term as treasurer , Moorlach , 39 , makes no secret that he still wants the job -- but with conditions . &quot; I want to be part of the rehabilitation plan , but I want to play a key role , &quot; he said . &quot; If it ' s just a little role , I ' ve got a better life . I don ' t need that. &quot; * Heady times , indeed , for a certified_public_accountant and Republican_Party activist who was so little known in February that almost no one showed_up when he announced his challenge to longtime incumbent Citron -- and who lost the June election to Citron by a 61 % -39 % margin . During the campaign , Moorlach was first dismissed by Citron and his allies , then accused of sparking baseless fears among the county ' s investors . Prominent Republicans such_as Bergeson withdrew their support . Finally , Moorlach was ridiculed by Citron as Chicken Little , witlessly foretelling disaster . To be proved right so quickly after such a resounding defeat feels pretty good now , even as Moorlach expresses sadness about the impact of the financial debacle on the citizens of Orange County . &quot; There is a God , &quot; he told his fellow Rotarians during his nearly hourlong speech last week . &quot; To be vindicated within six months is pretty amazing to me . But this is not the way I wanted it. &quot; Local Republican politicos are almost gushing about the opportunity that awaits him . &quot; I think ( Moorlach ) is the most sparkling star in the Orange County Republican galaxy at the moment , &quot; said Tom Fuentes , the local Republican chairman . Even those who have occasionally opposed Moorlach before concede that the biggest municipal bankruptcy in history has jump-started his political career . &quot; Being right on something like this has a tendency to put you in a good political position , &quot; said Costa Mesa City Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle , who supported Moorlach ' s campaign but has often quarreled with him on issues affecting the city where they both live . Bergeson and Jim Silva , the two supervisors-elect who will take their seats next month , have joined Supervisor William G . Steiner in saying they would support Moorlach ' s appointment to the treasurer ' s job . Riley , who is retiring from the board next week , declined to comment on the issue Saturday , noting that he was unlikely to be in office when the decision is made . Other supervisors could not be reached for comment . The financial crisis has so burnished Moorlach ' s reputation that many who once opposed him decline to criticize him , at least publicly . Frequent Moorlach critic Peer Swan , the Irvine Ranch Water District chairman credited with forcing revelations about the fund ' s $ 2-billion loss , declined to be quoted . In May , Swan castigated Moorlach ' s campaign tactics , comparing his behavior to &quot; a guy who runs_into a theater and yells ' Fire ! ' &quot; Hornbuckle also begged_off , pleading the Christmas spirit . Moorlach , she said , is &quot; thoughtful , he studies the issues , and he ' s an honest man . I won ' t say that he ' s humble , but I won ' t get more critical at the moment , not over the Christmas holidays. &quot; Another critic said Moorlach ' s problem in the election was not his message , but his method . If Moorlach had taken his careful research of Citron ' s portfolio , marshaled his political support and quietly approached each supervisor with his concerns , they might have listened , he said . &quot; Instead , the thrust of the campaign was to go_to New York and cause concern among some of the financial press to lower the credit rating of the county and try to force a change , &quot; he said . Fearful that the political attacks might cost the county money , its Republican leadership closed ranks around the veteran treasurer , who was then the county ' s only Democratic elected official . Not surprisingly , Moorlach ' s friends and political allies are easier to find , and more open , than his critics . &quot; He ' s probably one of the most honest , well-grounded people I know , &quot; said Jeff Thomas , a Tustin City Councilman and close friend . &quot; He has a real good_sense of himself . He ' s a very spiritual kind of guy . . . . I ' d walk over nails for the guy. &quot; &quot; He has done just an outstanding job for the whole community , &quot; said Karl Kemp , general_manager of the Mesa Consolidated Water District . Moorlach , whose full name is Johannes Meindert Willem Moorlach , was born Dec . 21 , 1955 , in Groningen , the_Netherlands . When he was 4 , his family moved to the United States , living first in Cypress and then in Buena Park . Even before he graduated from Cal State Long_Beach in 1977 , where he earned a degree in business administration , Moorlach began working for an accounting_firm . He joined his current firm -- Balser , Horowitz , Frank &amp; Wakeling -- in 1978 , and is now a vice_president . He is a workaholic , according to his wife , Trina , whom he met at a Bible study when they were both 23 . Although Moorlach ' s days since the crisis began have sometimes stretched to 20 hours , it does not seem much different than usual , Trina Moorlach says . &quot; He ' s always come_home for dinner and gone_back to the office or to meetings , &quot; she said . &quot; For me , this is like a regular routine still. &quot; * In what little spare_time he has , Moorlach , a history buff , enjoys photographing bronze historical markers , camping , hiking and tinkering with his beloved , pumpkin-colored Bricklin , whose license_plate reads &quot; DULL CPA. &quot; For many years , he has also been_active in local politics . A conservative Republican , Moorlach holds two posts with the Orange County GOP : assistant treasurer and chairman of the party ' s precinct advisory committee , a job that makes him head of its volunteer effort . For all Moorlach ' s current political cachet , at least one political consultant says it may be difficult for him to move_into any job but county treasurer -- the post Moorlach says he really wants . Because Moorlach has said he does not relish a move to Sacramento or Washington , and he lives_in Costa Mesa , which has a new county supervisor in Silva , consultant Harvey Englander believes Moorlach has fewer immediate political choices than his backers claim . &quot; Moorlach is in a position where he ' s got a golden opportunity , but really no opportunity other_than becoming the treasurer , &quot; Englander said . &quot; It ' s sort of like playing Monopoly and he ' s got a get_out of jail card , but he never lands in jail. &quot; Still , it might be difficult to discount the prescience of Moorlach ' s warnings , particularly those laid_out in the clear , forthright letter he wrote to Riley six months before the bond crisis erupted . His major concern , Moorlach wrote , was &quot; interest_rate risk , &quot; the likelihood that rates would continue to rise , at_odds with Citron ' s investment strategy of using the county ' s U.S. Treasury_bills and bonds as collateral for short-term borrowing at low interest . The borrowed money , in turn , was reinvested in securities that paid a higher rate of return . * BANKRUPTCY COVERAGE Related Orange County stories inside . A3</TEXT>
