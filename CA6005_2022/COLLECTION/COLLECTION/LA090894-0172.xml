   <HEADLINE> U.N. FEARS NEW ' CYCLE OF WAR ' IN RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the most alarming sign to date that Rwanda ' s agony is set to resume , young_men carrying stocks of rations and weapons are slipping into the country ' s forest borderlands in what appear to be &quot; classic preparations for guerrilla war , &quot; the top U.N. official here said . In his weekly situation report to U.N. headquarters , obtained by The Times , Shahryar Khan , special representative of the United Nations in Rwanda , gave the frankest assessment yet of recent security problems that spokesmen for the U.N. Assistance Mission to Rwanda had vaguely described as &quot; incidents. &quot; If action is not taken by the United Nations and Rwanda ' s new leaders , Khan said , &quot; The cycle of war , and possibly of massacres , that Rwanda has known could continue. &quot; Khan ' s report , sent by fax to New York , said &quot; military-age males , along with large supplies of rations , water and arms , have been observed coming_across the borders of Zaire and Burundi into Sector 4 ( the southwest ) of the country &quot; in the period from Aug . 29 through Sept . 4 . &quot; Areas of concern , &quot; Khan said , are the Kibungo prefecture , especially the area of Rusumo , the Gishwati Natural Forest , the Nyunge Natural Forest and the Akagera National_Park . &quot; These forests are dense and difficult to patrol , &quot; Khan said , implying that they are being used as hide-outs by armed infiltrators hostile to Rwanda ' s new government and that stopping them would be extremely difficult . Aid agencies reported that on Sunday night or Monday morning , a family of 15 Tutsi exiles returning from Uganda was slaughtered in the Byumba prefecture bordering_on the Akagera park . There was no proof of who was responsible , but the agency said the killings bore all_the hallmarks of a massacre by the ousted party ' s youth wing , the Interhamwe . The U.N. official ' s report , which termed the security situation as_a_whole in this pain-racked Central African_country &quot; stable , &quot; did not say how many men with weapons had been spotted . But the infiltration occurs against the backdrop of the phased-in introduction of troops from the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) army to the southwest for the first time . On Tuesday , the new government sent about 150 soldiers into a protection zone set_up by French troops in the southwest . The French last month withdrew from the zone , where half a_million Hutus have sought U.N. protection against feared reprisals for the massacre of at least 500 # 000 people , mostly civilians from Rwanda ' s Tutsi minority . The new , Tutsi-led government , installed by the victorious RPF rebels in July and now trying to consolidate its victory , has promised it will not tolerate such reprisals . For the previous two weeks , the only troops in the region had been three battalions of U.N. peacekeepers from other African_countries , which officials said totaled about 2 # 000 troops . Khan ' s report was a tacit admission that even the presence of the detachments under the U.N. flag had not stopped enemies of Rwanda ' s new government from gearing_up to resume the civil_war they lost in July . The ousted Rwandan government of hard-line Hutus fled with the bulk of the refugees into Zaire , and Khan said in his summary that , according to unconfirmed reports , as_many as 10 # 000 soldiers of the former Rwandan government forces had followed with half of their weaponry . &quot; About two-thirds of the soldiers were recruited during the civil_war and are perceived to be poorly trained , &quot; Khan said . &quot; There have also been reports that Zairian soldiers are training these forces. &quot; He stressed that the reports had not been confirmed . &quot; To counter the development of guerrilla warfare / border incursions , &quot; Khan recommended several steps , including broadening the support base of the new government , which its foes see as Tutsi-dominated despite the presence of a Hutu president and prime_minister . &quot; If these efforts at reconciliation are not made , the cycle of war , and possibly of massacres , that Rwanda has known could continue , &quot; Khan said . &quot; In addition , the risk of regional involvement in the conflict is real , and thus the problems of power-sharing and ethnic equality must be addressed inside Rwanda before they infiltrate and involve neighboring countries. &quot; By the risk of broader involvement , Khan may have been referring to the extension of the conflict to Burundi -- where a similar ethnic feud has long existed between Tutsis and Hutus -- or to Zaire . Also on Wednesday , U.N. human_rights investigators said they received credible evidence that at least 50 people from villages in the country ' s center , including returning Rwandan refugees , had vanished without a trace after being detained by soldiers from the new government . Some of the arrests took_place as recently as Sunday , said Benedicte Giaever , field coordinator for the U.N. Secretariat ' s Department of Humanitarian Affairs . &quot; The thing is , no one knows what has happened to these people , &quot; Giaever said . The fear that the government will conduct reprisals is one reason so few of the refugees who fled en masse into Zaire this summer are returning . On Tuesday , U.N. relief officials in Rwanda said the flow back homeward was averaging 1 # 000 a day -- a fraction of the more_than 1 million Rwandans now in Zaire . As part of a five-member team , Giaever traveled_to the villages of Ruhango and Rugogwe in Gitarama prefecture on Wednesday following persistent reports that from 30 to 75 people disappeared in August , as well as two more Sunday . &quot; There are two possibilities : They have either been killed or are alive in detention , &quot; Giaever said . In rural Ruhango , Giaever said one motive behind the detention seemed to be property disputes between new settlers and the returning refugees . &quot; It ' s about property , old disputes , cows , &quot; she said . In some cases , she said , it appeared the new occupants of the homes and small farm plots had gone_to the army and had soldiers arrest the returnees , most of whom were members of the Hutu ethnic majority in whose name the former government ruled . In contrast , in the poorer farming settlement of Rugogwe , the soldiers seemed to carry_out the arrests from lists , she said . That could mean those affected might be suspected of having taken_part in this spring ' s frenzied massacre of members of the political opposition and Tutsi minority . Giaever ' s findings appeared to indicate that the actions of the soldiers in the Gitarama region villages were carried_out without the blessing of Rwanda ' s new leaders . On Aug . 17 , she said , Vice_President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame , the Tutsi who led the rebel army to victory , held a general meeting in the area . &quot; It seems like the higher levels of the RPF are trying to keep a very clean line , &quot; Giaever said . After Kagame ' s visit , some units of the RPF army were pulled_out of the area and control was handed to civil administrators , she said .</TEXT>
