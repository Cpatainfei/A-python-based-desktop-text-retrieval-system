   <HEADLINE> THINK_TANK AT NIXON LIBRARY GETS $ 1 MILLION ; DONATION : GIFT FROM AGRIBUSINESS MAGNATE DWAYNE O . ANDREAS WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE CENTER FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM IN YORBA LINDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Agribusiness magnate Dwayne O . Andreas , known for his major financial_support of both Republican and Democratic politicians through the decades , has made a $ 1-million gift to the Center for Peace and Freedom at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace , a significant boost for the fledgling think_tank . &quot; During a remarkable two decades as an elder_statesman -- through his writings , his fact-finding trips , and his public statements -- President Nixon demonstrated a profound commitment to finding pragmatic solutions to international problems , &quot; Andreas , chairman_of_the_board and chief_executive of Archer Daniels Midland Co. , said in a statement issued from his Decatur , Ill. , headquarters . Andreas , 76 , added that he and his wife , Inez , are &quot; pleased to have this opportunity to help perpetuate his matchless legacy. &quot; In announcing the gift , George L . Argyros , chairman of the Nixon library ' s $ 25-million &quot; Legacy of Peace &quot; fund-raising_campaign , said : &quot; As we redouble our commitment to sustaining the legacy and , now , the memory of President Nixon , we accept Dwayne Andreas ' generous gift with enormous gratitude . &quot; His leadership support has dramatically energized our campaign to establish the Center for Peace and Freedom , which in turn will have a dramatic impact on future generations by helping guide our leaders through the complexities of foreign and domestic policy , &quot; he said . &quot; We are proud that our campaign has been joined by one of America ' s premier citizen-statesmen -- one who , like President Nixon did , thinks in global strategic terms. &quot; Born in 1918 in Worthington , Minn. , Andreas joined Archer Daniels Midland in 1966 , taking the helm in 1970 . Among many other associations , he has served on federal advisory bodies under both Republican and Democratic Presidents . He is perhaps best known outside agribusiness circles as having contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the campaign coffers of politicians from both parties , a role that has sometimes landed him in controversy . In 1974 , he was indicted , but then acquitted , on charges of funneling illegal corporate contributions to his good friend , former vice_president and Democratic presidential candidate , Hubert H . Humphrey . A $ 25 # 000 campaign contribution in 1972 to Nixon fund-raiser Kenneth H . Dahlberg turned him into what he once described to the Washington Post as an &quot; innocent bystander &quot; in the Watergate scandal . That money ended_up in the bank_account of Watergate burglar Bernard L . Barker , giving investigators the first link between the Watergate break-in and the Nixon campaign committee . His $ 1-million gift will provide support for the Center for Peace and Freedom , which officials say will add a voice to the debate over contemporary political issues and preserve Nixon ' s place in history as a key player in shaping world events . The center will be headquartered at the Nixon library and also have an office in Washington . It began operations in March when former President Nixon spoke in the nation ' s capital before 45 key foreign_policy officials , analysts and commentators at the inaugural meeting of the center ' s Study Group on National Security , chaired by former Secretary_of_Defense James R . Schlesinger . That speech was the 37th President ' s last before his death in April . A second study group session , also chaired by Schlesinger , will be held later this month in Washington . The &quot; Legacy of Peace &quot; campaign was launched without fanfare in mid-1993 . It was announced in January by Argyros -- chairman and chief_executive_officer of Arnel &amp; Affiliates in Costa Mesa -- in Yorba Linda during ceremonies honoring former President Nixon on the 25th anniversary of his first inauguration . Andreas ' gift brings the total raised to $ 14.5 million , or nearly 60 % of the campaign ' s goal , according to the center . ( The campaign is spearheaded by a $ 5-million Challenge Grant from philanthropist Walter H . Annenberg ' s Annenberg Foundation. ) &quot; Dwayne Andreas is a longtime friend of the Nixon family and was both a political supporter of President Nixon and a supporter of his work as an elder_statesman , &quot; John H . Taylor , library director , said in a statement . &quot; Among many other things , he accompanied President Nixon to Russia in 1992 for a dramatic meeting with Boris Yeltsin only a_few months after the fall of communism . &quot; His support of the center will ensure that the same principles of extending peace and freedom Mr. Nixon applied as a former President will continue to be applied in the century to come_to the problems and opportunities we will face as a nation. &quot;</TEXT>
