   <TEXT> The Internet is a bit like the weather . Lots of people like to talk_about it , few people understand it and no one can control it . But the Internet is getting a little easier to use , thanks to America Online and some commercial Internet providers . The Internet , a worldwide network of networks designed during the 1970s for scientists , academics and defense_contractors , is now available to everyone . However , as_many new subscribers have found_out , getting_on and learning to use the Internet can be a lot more difficult than they imagined . There are several reasons for this . To begin with , most Internet providers run under the Unix operating system and require users to understand at least a_few Unix commands . This is quite different from commercial on-line services such_as Prodigy , America Online and CompuServe , which Windows and Macintosh users navigate by pointing and clicking at menus and icons . Ironically , the most difficult type of account to set_up is the type you need if you want to run Mosaic , an easy-to-use Macintosh and Windows Internet access program . The good news about Mosaic is that it is in the public_domain , so you don ' t have to buy_it . You have already paid_for it with your federal tax dollars . The bad news is that you can ' t run Mosaic with just any type of Internet account . You have to set_up either a SLIP ( Serial Line Internet Protocol ) or PPP ( Point-to-Point Protocol ) account . And before you can log_on , you must obtain and configure some pretty obtuse software . It ' s not for everyone . Several companies are working to change all this . America Online , a major commercial service for users of DOS , Windows and Mac , is now offering access to some , but not all , Internet resources . Like other such services , it offers its members the ability to exchange electronic_mail via the Internet , but unlike most other commercial on-line services , it also offers access to Internet news groups . There are thousands of news groups ( forums ) that let you post questions , respond to others ' comments and read articles posted by people around the world . America Online charges $ 9.95 a month , which includes five free hours . Additional hours are $ 3.50 each . America Online recently expanded its Internet offerings to include Gopher and WAIS . Gopher is a menu system that lets you cruise from one Internet provider to another . Gophers are organized by subject and geographic_area . WAIS ( Wide Area Information Server ) is a database that allows you to find your way around the network by entering the correct keywords . America Online ' s Gopher is organized by subject_matter , so it is very easy to find your way around . * While AOL expands to embrace the Internet , several commercial Internet providers are developing software to make their services much easier to use . Netcom ( ( 800 ) 501-8649 ) will soon release its NetCruiser software , which will allow Windows users to navigate the Internet by clicking on icons . Unlike Mosaic , NetCruiser is a snap to install . The software automatically takes_care of all_the obscure commands and configuration routines and even helps you find the local access phone_number . Best of all , once you ' re on , you never have to issue a single Unix command . NetCruiser provides access to most Internet resources , including World Wide Web , Gopher , FTP ( files for downloading ) and e-mail . The company plans to charge NetCruiser users $ 19.95 a month for up_to 25 hours of access . Pipeline ( ( 212 ) 267-3636 ) , a New York-based Internet provider , offers an elegant and easy-to-use Windows access program for its system . Pull-down menus and icons connect with most Internet services . A powerful electronic_mail editor makes_it easy to read and send mail . To save time and money , the software allows you to download mail and news group articles onto a hard_disk , so you can read and respond before you log_on to the service . The company offers a number of price plans , starting at $ 15 month plus $ 2 an hour for access from the New York area . For an additional hourly fee , you ' ll soon be able to use the service from anywhere in the United States . Subscribers who already have access to the Internet can avoid extra access charges by using their current Internet service to access Pipeline . * Whatever system you choose for using the Internet , keep your expectations in check . There is a lot to explore , but it takes a while to get used to it all . For novices , the best strategy is to use the Gopher menu system to cruise around the net .</TEXT>
