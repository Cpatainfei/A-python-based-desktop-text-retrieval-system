   <HEADLINE> BLUE CROSS TO OFFER COVERAGE TO ALL APPLICANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the private health_care industry ' s most significant step toward universal health coverage in the state , Blue Cross of California said it has begun offering guaranteed coverage to all individuals regardless of their medical condition . Also Wednesday , rival Kaiser Permanente announced a venture with Pacific Mutual Life_Insurance Co . to give Kaiser ' s 4.6 million California patients the option of using doctors and medical facilities outside the vast Kaiser network . It marks the first time that Kaiser has allowed all members of its two California health_maintenance_organizations to seek medical help from non-Kaiser doctors . A pilot_program in Bakersfield has existed since 1987 . The moves by the state ' s two largest health carriers reflect both the wrenching competition in the California health_care market and the impetus that federal and state health reformers have given the private sector to propose solutions to the health_care crisis . Under the program announced Wednesday , Blue Cross -- which insures 5.7 million Californians -- will no longer reject any individual applicants because of disease or illness . Instead it will separate them into three different categories based on their medical condition , setting fees and co-payments accordingly . &quot; It ' s an excellent move_in the direction of reducing and finally eliminating prior conditions and other barriers to health_care access , &quot; said Albert Lowey-Ball , a Sacramento-based managed-care consultant . A state law that took_effect Jan . 1 limited the kinds of waiting periods and other restrictions that health insurers may place on individuals seeking coverage . Broader reforms were enacted a year earlier for health plans covering small businesses , but they did not affect individuals or firms with fewer than five employees . Even before the new law took_effect , insurers were scrambling to go the reformers one better . Blue Shield of California , for example , announced that it was dropping all waiting periods and waivers that exclude benefits for specified medical conditions . However , Blue Shield said that it would still refuse coverage to some applicants with health_problems and in fact would probably increase the percentage of applicants it rejects . Blue Cross , California ' s largest insurer of individuals with 750 # 000 such enrollees , decided to take all comers but retain six-month waiting periods for certain applicants ' pre-existing medical conditions . D . Mark Weinberg , Blue Cross executive_vice_president , said the company ' s goal for years has been to accept all applicants , but it did not become practical until government reforms pushed the industry in that direction , forcing all carriers to take some of the risk . As with any government health reform plan that has been suggested , healthier people will subsidize sicker ones , Weinberg said . &quot; We acknowledge this as a positive step , &quot; Maria Ferrer , executive_director of the public interest_group Health Access , said of the Blue Cross initiative , &quot; but it ' s a long way from universal access at affordable rates. &quot; The Blue Cross program is divided into three categories . Level I , which the company said would include about 75 % of all applicants , offers a choice of a health_maintenance_organization with a $ 10 fee per office visit or a preferred-provider network , with the enrollee paying a 20 % co-payment ( up_to $ 2 # 000 ) for services . Healthy individuals would qualify for Level I , as would most people with ailments such_as asthma , epilepsy , skin_cancer and ulcers . The average premium for Level I coverage would be $ 96 a month , Blue Cross said . Level II , for those with more serious conditions such_as diabetes , Hodgkin ' s disease and hypertension -- about 20 % of applicants -- offers only a preferred-provider network plan , with a 20 % co-payment of up_to $ 10 # 000 . The monthly premium is 50 % higher , averaging $ 143 a month . Level III , with average monthly premiums of $ 214 , is offered to people with such life-threatening conditions as AIDS , cancer and heart_disease . There is a $ 50 # 000 annual limit on benefits , plus a 20 % co-payment , up_to $ 2 # 000 . Also , applicants must be_on the waiting list for the state ' s Major Risk Medical Insurance Program , the state-subsidized insurer of last_resort for those with severe illness . &quot; If President Clinton ' s ( health reform ) activity has had any effect , it has been to challenge the industry to fix the health_care system ' s problems ourselves , &quot; Weinberg said . Kaiser ' s venture with Pacific Mutual , the largest California-based life_insurance company , is a response to increasing demands for greater choice for employees and simplified billing and administration for employers , as well as_to Clinton ' s health_care reform proposals . &quot; Both Kaiser and Pacific Mutual face an increasing need for providing choices , &quot; said Michael Berumen , a senior_vice_president at Pacific Mutual ' s group health and life_insurance subsidiary . Kaiser members in Southern California may see a doctor of their choice for any illness or treatment and be covered by a Pacific Mutual indemnity plan , a group health plan covering most medical needs , Berumen said . Members , for instance , could use the HMO for minor injuries or ailments such_as the flu and pay a little more to go_through Pacific Mutual for , say , a heart_specialist . In Northern California , employees will have the option of joining the HMO or the Pacific Mutual plan . During a specified subscription period each year , employees can switch . Pacific Mutual and Kaiser hope to offer their plan to employers this spring . Kaiser , which has 6.5 million members nationwide , will roll_out similar programs later for plans in Colorado and on the East Coast . While the alliance is perhaps the biggest venture of its type , as well as one that does not involve a merger , point-of-service plans have been proliferating among Kaiser ' s competitors . &quot; Kaiser had no choice if they wanted to catch_up_with the rest of the marketplace , &quot; said Bert B . Wagener , president of CIGNA Health_Care of California , which has run such a program since 1988 . Times staff writer David R . Olmos contributed to this story .</TEXT>
