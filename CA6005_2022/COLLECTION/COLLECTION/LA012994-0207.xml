   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; ILLNESS SPREADS AT CAMPS FOR QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Colds and coughs have spread rapidly among earthquake victims living outdoors , adding_to the misery of those displaced from their homes and prompting some health officials to worry that outbreaks of more serious diseases could follow . Although no statistics are available , doctors say they are seeing a high number of flus , colds , digestive ailments , ear infections and bronchitis among earthquake victims , especially small children . And they are sending more people to hospitals for what should be minor ailments . Mark Perez , a doctor with El Proyecto Del Barrio in Pacoima , said of the children he has diagnosed with flu , an usually high number -- about 5 % -- have been hospitalized for dehydration , a result of being in camps where water was in short supply . Perez and other health workers say they are also concerned that the camps may be fertile ground for chickenpox because of the difficulty of quarantining children living_in the tents . In an attempt to stave_off such problems , Kaiser Permanente announced an emergency $ 120 # 000 grant to six local health clinics Friday . The Kaiser grants will be used for extra doctors and supplies , such_as injectable antibiotics . The demand has been great for antibiotics in pill form , which must be refrigerated , and many earthquake victims have no way to keep them cold , Perez said . So far , Los Angeles County health officials have treated more_than 10 # 000 earthquake victims at local clinics and mobile emergency medical units . Medical services have also been provided through a wide array of volunteer efforts organized through local hospitals and medical groups as far away as New Mexico . Those seeking help included Pacoima resident Maria Esther Diaz , who fled her home the night of the earthquake clutching a naked baby in her arms . A night outdoors without proper coverings was too_much for 11-month-old Everett Diaz . &quot; In two days he started this cough , very bad , this agh . . . agh . . . agh , &quot; Diaz said . Everett developed such a severe case of asthma and bronchitis that when Diaz brought him to a clinic , doctors rushed to strap his small face onto an oxygen_mask , she said . For doctors , medical_practice in the camps has meant dealing with extreme forms of ordinary complaints . Perez shook his head as he examined the leg of an elderly Panorama City woman who nearly developed gangrene after receiving a deep gash while escaping her home during the quake . The woman , Beatriz Navarros , waited five days to go_to a doctor , and in the meantime developed a severe infection that spread rapidly down her leg . &quot; This is not something we usually would have seen , &quot; Perez said . Speaking in Spanish , Navarros said she didn ' t have the time or money to deal with the cut after the quake left her homeless . Charged with caring for her 89-year-old mother outdoors , she simply poured hydrogen_peroxide on the wound and hoped for the best . Despite these miseries , some public health officials are counting their blessings . Although the camps have bred colds aplenty , there has been no outbreak of any severe intestinal illnesses , always a danger when clean water is in short supply . But the real test of health conditions in the camps is still weeks away , according to some doctors and nurses working in the camps . More serious infectious_diseases , such_as hepatitis_A and chickenpox , take several weeks to incubate . So for the moment , their spread in the camps is invisible , said Kaiser Permanente doctor Linda Croad , who specializes in infectious_diseases . Croad and others are already anticipating new outbreaks of chickenpox resulting from the camps , and they say influenza cases may also rise . The threat of a chickenpox outbreak was downplayed by Caswell Evans , director of public health programs and services for Los Angeles County Department of Health Services , as he breezed_through Valley emergency health clinics Friday as part of a fact-finding tour with Philip R . Lee , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services assistant secretary for health . Evans dismissed the concerns , adding that there is &quot; no more likelihood of children catching chickenpox in camps than if they were in school. &quot; But his statements were belied by his own staff in the field , who maintained that kids stay home from school if they ' re sick , but can only be removed as far as the next tent in a camp . Perez , the doctor in Pacoima , said that he has already seen at least 20 cases of chickenpox in east San Fernando Valley camps . In many cases , the victims were not quarantined until well after the infection had set_in and were living_in close proximity to other children in the meantime , he said . A child infected with chickenpox will not show symptoms for two to three weeks . Moreover , the disease can be transmitted before any spots appear on the skin , so even quarantining the visibly sick won ' t keep it from spreading , said Bernie Nelson , director of nurses for the Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health Center . Nelson said that other ailments , such_as hepatitis_A , take two weeks to a month to incubate . Because people in camps are using outhouses and have fewer opportunities to wash their hands than if they were living indoors , there is a greater likelihood that hepatitis will appear and spread , she said . Croad said she is also worried that the camps may promote the spread of tuberculosis , already increasing at epidemic rates in California . Rates of tuberculosis are high among immigrants and homeless people , groups that are thought to be well-represented in the camps , she said . Tuberculosis can be transmitted by exposure to airborne microbes over days or hours . Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable . &quot; There are a lot of people out there with coughs , right now . This is something we are very worried about , &quot; Croad said . Tuberculosis carriers may assume they have a minor cold and cough all night in crowded tents without realizing they risk exposing their neighbors , she said . Shirley Fannin , director of disease control programs for the county health department , said such risks are decreasing hourly as the camps empty out and medical services become progressively more organized . But for some , even fear of illness cannot conquer their dread of returning indoors . Aseda Corona , who brought her 3-year-old son , Mario , to Perez ' s clinic for treatment for a cough and ear infection , said she knew that living more_than a week outdoors was hurting the boy . But going_back indoors is no simple matter . The boy still cries with fear as soon as he crosses the threshold , she said .</TEXT>
