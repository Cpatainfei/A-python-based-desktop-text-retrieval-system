   <HEADLINE> CUBAN AMERICANS SEEK END TO REFUGEES ' LONG DETENTION ; IMMIGRATION : DESPITE ACCORD , FLORIDA ACTIVISTS CALL FOR THE RELEASE OF MIGRANTS HELD AT U.S. FACILITIES . THEY SAY CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING MOST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite the agreement Friday between the United States and Cuba , frustration is mounting in south Florida ' s Cuban community over the indefinite internment of exiles here and at the U.S. Navy_base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Now that the United States has agreed to increase the number of Cubans allowed into the country each year , Cuban Americans here believe that the Clinton_Administration should abandon its policy of refusing to process immigration requests at detention centers . Administration officials said Friday that Cuban rafters being held at safe havens must return to Cuba and make their application in Havana . &quot; Who is going_to return to Cuba to apply for political asylum ? that ' s a joke , &quot; said Miami human_rights activist Siro del Castillo . &quot; These people have the right to apply . The U.S. can turn them down. &quot; Most Cuban Americans here had voiced support of the Administration ' s hard-line stance in handling of the Cuban crisis , even accepting as necessary the vow of U.S. Atty . Gen . Janet Reno that no migrant picked_up at_sea after the Aug . 20 cutoff will be permitted to enter the United States . At the same time , stark conditions in the barbed-wire camps have led many Cuban Americans to call_for the release , at the least , of more_than 600 children in custody . &quot; This environment is just not appropriate for children , &quot; said Francisco Hernandez , president of the Cuban-American National Foundation and a member of an ad-hoc monitoring group , Cuba Crisis Steering Committee , which this week visited more_than 600 Cubans being held_in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ' s Krome Detention Center , west of Miami . &quot; It does not look good seeing children who have gone_through a difficult situation -- risking their lives -- and their parents , being subjected_to this situation , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; We think those who come_in with_children should be released. &quot; All others held at the centers should be given an opportunity promptly to apply to enter the United States , Cuban Americans said . Arturo Cobo , director of the Transit House for Cuban Rafters in Key West , harshly criticized the Administration ' s detention policy as violating &quot; the basic human_rights of the Cuban nationals who are fleeing from Castro ' s dictatorship. &quot; In paid newspaper_advertisements in English and Spanish , Cobo charged that Cubans are being held &quot; incommunicado &quot; in camps and being denied adequate medical attention . Del Castillo said that under United Nations conventions , &quot; people cannot be expelled or forced to go_back to the country from which they fled . If the U.S. in some way pressures these Cubans back to Cuba to apply , then it is not complying with the U.N. agreement . &quot; It is a sad irony that through this agreement the U.S._government asks the Cuban government to do what they have criticized them for years for doing : not letting people leave the country. &quot; Although the exodus of Cubans has slowed in recent days -- only 86 rafters were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard by midafternoon Friday -- more_than 30 # 000 remain in custody , most at Guantanamo . More_than 500 others are being held_in Panama and at a detention facility in Port Isabel , Tex . Interning Cuban refugees as a way of halting the dangerous flotilla of rafts was never a palatable prospect , especially for Cuban Americans . But most Cubans in Miami supported the Clinton plan if it promised to thwart Castro ' s attempts to ease internal tensions in Cuba by letting discontented citizens flee . But in recent days , tensions in the Guantanamo camp and in the Krome detention center have spilled_over into the Cuban community here , especially regarding children . &quot; Some of these children are in critical ( emotional ) condition , &quot; said Robert Boyer , one of two Miami attorneys who has filed a class-action lawsuit demanding that the INS release more_than 100 children held at Krome . &quot; They are agitated , on edge , asking when they ' re leaving , going_home to relatives , grandparents . These people are not criminals. &quot; Cuban-born U.S. Reps . Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida have also called_for the children to be freed . In the 12 years that Krome , a converted missile base on the edge of the Everglades , has been used as a detention center to hold illegal immigrants , no child has ever been held for longer than a_few days . Children stay in dormitories with their mothers , while men sleep_in a large tent . Fathers are allowed to visit their wives and children twice a week . Although Dade County has dispatched Spanish-speaking teachers to the detention center , even the director of the school_system ' s outreach program has called_for the detainees ' release . &quot; We have hundreds of children , and their relatives , in American detention centers , &quot; said Eduardo Martinez-DuBochet in a letter to the editor printed in Friday ' s Miami Herald . &quot; Where is the spirit of Ellis Island ? &quot; All these children and their anguished parents are beautiful human_beings . We need to open the detention center ' s doors. &quot;</TEXT>
