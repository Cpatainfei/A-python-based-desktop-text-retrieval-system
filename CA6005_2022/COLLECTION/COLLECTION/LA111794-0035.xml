   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; ' RAOUL ' : CULT CLASSIC FILM BECOMES A MUSICAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 1982 film &quot; Eating Raoul &quot; was a low-budget satire that grew_into a cult hit . While the rest of America was swept_up in the Reagan revolution , the disaffected took_to the film ' s Swiftian vision of a society where one must eat others or be eaten . Now &quot; Eating Raoul &quot; is back , this time as a musical at Odyssey Theatre Ensemble in West Los Angeles . Mere satire might not be enough for today ' s disaffected masses , as last week ' s stunning electoral upsets suggest . But that ' s OK , because the players in &quot; Eating Raoul : The Musical &quot; don ' t have much time for politics or cultural criticism . They ' re too busy dancing -- most memorably in skintight leather garb and fishnet stockings . And singing -- mostly cabaret tunes that summon memories of &quot; Little Shop of Horrors. &quot; Filmmaker-turned-librettist Paul Bartel , along with composer Jed Feuer and lyricist Boyd Graham , have turned Bartel ' s movie into an over-the-top tuner that manages to make cannibalism look cute and cuddly . It ' s a lot of good clean dirty fun , even if the original point gets lost amid jokes about cross-dressing and other perversions . &quot; Sweeney Todd &quot; this ain ' t . Bartel ' s featherweight book concerns Paul and Mary Bland ( Tom McCleister and Hope Levy ) , an aptly named Los Angeles couple working hard to buy a small restaurant far from the city . &quot; we ' ll carry a mortgage instead of Mace , &quot; they happily predict in one number . * But the dream is in peril . Paul gets fired and has his car stolen . Mary fends off a lecherous bank officer who denies the restaurant loan . Desperate , the two turn_to a life of crime , advertising kinky sex services and then killing and robbing the perverts who answer the ads . This soon leads them into partnership with Raoul ( Rick Negron ) , a janitor far more practiced in crime and betrayal . Both book and songs are little more_than hat racks for choreographer Adam Shankman ' s flamboyant production numbers . Don ' t bother listening for trenchant rhymes or dialogue here . The only sizzle comes_in routines like &quot; Hot Monkey Love , &quot; an homage to Marlene Dietrich ' s famous &quot; Hot Voodoo. &quot; If &quot; Eating Raoul &quot; loses its bite before the final curtain , it ' s partly because some cast members -- notably McCleister -- seem a little distracted . Paul is supposed to be bland , yes , but not catatonic . Worse , director Scott Wittman has permitted far too many technical goofs , even for a small stage . * &quot; Eating Raoul : The Musical , &quot; Odyssey Theatre Ensemble , 2055 S . Sepulveda Blvd. , West Los Angeles . Wednesdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. , Sundays , 7 p.m. Ends Dec . 18 . $ 18.50- $ 22.50. ( 310 ) 477-2055 . Running time : 2 hours , 15 minutes .</TEXT>
