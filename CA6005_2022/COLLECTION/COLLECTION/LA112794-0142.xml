   <HEADLINE> DNA NOBEL WINNER ASKS BIG QUESTIONS ; SCIENCE : TODAY DR . FRANCIS CRICK IS BUSY WADING INTO OTHER SCIENTIFIC SWAMPS : HOW DID THE EARTH COME ABOUT ? WHAT ARE DREAMS ? HOW DOES THE BRAIN WORK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You go_to the grocery_store and find new , redder , longer-lasting tomatoes . You come_home and turn_on the television and find lawyers discussing O . J . Simpson blood_tests . What ' s the connection ? A 77-year-old man with shaggy white eyebrows and an impish grin -- Dr. Francis Crick . Forty years ago , Crick and a fellow researcher unveiled the intertwined spiral model we now identify as DNA , which holds the coding that makes some of us blond and others brunette . But these days , as the DNA frontiers continue to explode around him , Crick has only a &quot; distanced &quot; interest in the subject . He is too busy wading into other scientific swamps , seeking answers to Big Questions that haunt inquiring minds : How did Earth come_about ? What are dreams ? How does the brain work ? Unlike many other scientists , Crick , who was born in Britain and lived there until he was 60 , rarely sets foot in a lab or a classroom . &quot; Essentially I read and think , &quot; says the affable but media-shy Crick , showing a reporter a stack of research papers with esoteric titles and offering wryly to loan him one . And then he writes books . In one , Crick postulates that the Earth began when microorganisms were dropped_by a spaceship from a higher civilization . In another , he theorizes that dreams are not the tangle of emotions and hidden drives psychoanalysts would have us believe . Rather , he writes , their function is to allow the brain to flush itself so one ' s memory can function the following day . Crick admits that some of his offerings are a bit &quot; out there , &quot; a tad &quot; speculative. &quot; Some , he even says , he might like to revise . But it doesn ' t bother Crick , the recipient of a 1962 Nobel Prize for his DNA work , that some of his musings may turn_out to be wildly off the mark . &quot; A man who is right every time is not likely to do very much , &quot; he says , sitting in his Salk Institute office , a serene and cozy wood-paneled room with views of the Pacific_Ocean . It wasn ' t until about 20 years after Crick and partner James Watson discovered the molecular structure of DNA that their conclusions were firmly established . At the time , says Crick , only a small number of people &quot; even thought it was interesting. &quot; that ' s the way science works , he explains . You make a discovery , you generate a theory . Sometimes it works , more often it doesn ' t . Sometimes you don ' t live long enough to find_out . It ' s true that without the 1953 Crick-Watson research , the world probably would n ' t be eating plumper , redder tomatoes or watching lawyers feud over Simpson blood_tests results . But this new power -- the power to manipulate genes -- also has led to raging debates about whether scientists will someday be breeding human_beings , too . &quot; Think_of the effect television has had worldwide on politics , &quot; said Crick . &quot; You can ' t possibly expect the man who invented the transistor to have seen that . &quot; You can just reckon that any powerful technique you invent , even if it is beneficial , is going_to have effects much wider than you think , and it ' s going_to have some disadvantages. &quot; Crick ' s latest trek into the unknown is the book &quot; The Astonishing Hypothesis : The Scientific Search for the Soul. &quot; Its central tenet -- that everything we see , feel and think is nothing more_than the behaviors of a pack of neurons and molecules -- is vintage Crick . If true , it would mean that things like sadness or desire are not attributable to some inner spirit or will , but caused by brain chemistry . &quot; Can you explain why blue looks blue ? &quot; asks Crick . &quot; It ' s no use saying the sky looks blue . That doesn ' t say why it looks blue . Why doesn ' t it look red ? . . . that ' s a very difficult question . &quot; We are trying to go_around that and find_out what happens in your head when you see blue . Maybe that will give us a clue to answer these difficult questions. &quot; Crick says he enjoys his life . He still comes_to the office daily and often stays for the full day , although he has no official duties . He professes to be irritated by interruptions of any sort -- especially of the media variety . Nonetheless , he remains witty and charming throughout an hourlong interview . &quot; You see , I ' m one of these people who is against communication , &quot; he says in British tones that are part Oxford don , part Monty Python . &quot; I want less communication because far many_more people want to communicate with me than I want to communicate with. &quot; As for the Nobel , well , he ' s found it can be very helpful when trying to secure a visa in a hurry . But other times , he says , it ' s a real albatross . &quot; If you go_out to dinner , it ' s a good idea to conceal the fact that you ' ve got a Nobel Prize , &quot; he explains . &quot; Otherwise they don ' t know what to say. &quot;</TEXT>
