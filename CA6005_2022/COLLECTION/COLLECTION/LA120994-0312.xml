   <HEADLINE> FOES OF PROP . 187 URGE BOYCOTT OF NABISCO , DISNEY ; PROTEST : GROUPS POINT TO COMPANIES ' HEAVY CONTRIBUTION TO REELECTION OF GOV . WILSON AND OTHERS WHO SUPPORTED INITIATIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Activists who unsuccessfully fought Proposition 187 at the ballot_box unveiled formal boycott plans Thursday against two U.S. corporate icons -- the purveyors of Mickey_Mouse and Oreos -- in an effort to capitalize on the economic clout of Latino consumers and others opposed to the immigration initiative . Boycott organizers , who are hoping to win support throughout the United States and Latin_America , are targeting Walt Disney Co . and RJR Nabisco because of major donations by corporate officers to the reelection campaign of Gov . Pete Wilson and other pro-187 Republican candidates . &quot; We want to sensitize companies like Disneyland that make earnings from immigrants , &quot; said Fabian Nunez of La Alianza in Pomona , speaking_to reporters outside the main entrance to the Anaheim tourist mecca . &quot; These corporations need to be sensitive to the people that make them wealthy. &quot; Carol Makovich , a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco in New York , said the conglomerate did not take a position on Proposition 187 . Boycott representatives have not contacted RJR Nabisco , said Makovich , who declined further comment . Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said the company also remained neutral on Proposition 187 and that its gubernatorial campaign contributions , which also included donations to Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown , &quot; were based entirely on business and tourism concerns as you would expect with the Disney Co. &quot; Proposition 187 won by an almost 3-2 margin at the polls , where exit interviews showed Latinos made_up only 8 % of the voters although they account_for 27 % of the state ' s population . Latino activists Thursday termed boycotts an alternative method to demonstrate their growing clout . &quot; We don ' t have the electoral power that our numbers would suggest , but it ' s important to show the community that we do have economic power -- the community does have a voice , &quot; said Evangeline Ordaz , a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge . She was among those announcing the RJR Nabisco boycott at a separate news_conference outside a Latino supermarket in the largely immigrant Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles . Sponsoring the action against the tobacco and food conglomerate is the California Latino Civil Rights Network , an activist group that helped organize a large anti-Proposition 187 march in Los Angeles last spring . The Disney boycott is being led by Coordinadora ' 96 , a coalition of leaders of smallish grass-roots immigration rights groups including One-Stop Immigration of Los Angeles and La Alianza . The group said its boycott will also concentrate_on Chevron -- another substantial contributor to Wilson ' s campaign -- and on national convention business slated for California . Thursday ' s actions are the latest in a series of Latino-led boycotts -- some seemingly spontaneous , others , like Thursday ' s moves , planned in_advance -- against donors to Wilson , who made his support for Proposition 187 a centerpiece of his reelection effort . Organizers made_it clear that additional companies would be targeted because of their financial_support for Wilson and other Republicans . The GOP helped bankroll the pro-187 campaign and Wilson ran a series of tough , pro-187 TV ads . &quot; We feel the Republican_Party is trying to scapegoat the Latino and immigrant community for their own political gain , and that ' s immoral , &quot; said Mario Salgado , executive_director of the Civil Rights Network . &quot; People are being hurt by it , and these companies need to pay the price. &quot; Wilson has termed the boycotts counterproductive . &quot; Boycotts help no one , and many of these Latino activists who are calling_for boycotts are hurting their fellow Latinos and recent immigrants who work in entry-level service sector and manufacturing jobs , &quot; said Sean Walsh , a spokesman for the governor . A demonstration to kick_off the boycott of Disneyland , Disney films and other merchandise is planned outside the main gate of the Magic Kingdom on Saturday morning by boycott leaders , who helped organize the massive October protest against Proposition 187 in downtown Los Angeles . The boycott will continue at least until 1996 , they said . &quot; What we ' re looking_for from Disneyland is sensitivity to our community , &quot; said Nunez , an American flag unfurled behind him , &quot; and a commitment from this corporation that they are committed to advancing the interests of this immigrant community. &quot; Nunez said he believes a boycott can have &quot; a substantial impact &quot; on Disney , even though he has no expectation of bringing the company to its knees . &quot; The image of Disneyland will have to be re-evaluated by many people who come_to the theme park , &quot; he said . For decades , he noted , the portrayal of ethnic_groups in Disney cartoons has raised questions , most recently criticism of Arab characters in &quot; Aladdin. &quot; Coming_in the same week that Orange County declared bankruptcy , Nunez conceded , some might take a boycott of the county ' s ultimate icon as rubbing salt in a wound . &quot; I think there may be a backlash , but we ' re willing to face the consequences of that , &quot; he said . Leaders of the boycott against RJR Nabisco -- whose expansive line ranges from Camel cigarettes to Oreo , Fig Newton and Chips Ahoy ! cookies to A-1 steak_sauce and Ortega brand Mexican food_products -- announced their action in the parking_lot of Liborio ' s Market , which caters to a largely Latino immigrant clientele . Spreading the word through community groups , churches and other organizations , boycott strategists plan to reach shoppers throughout the United States and Latin_America -- where Nabisco sales also are high . &quot; There are alternatives to all these products , &quot; said Roberto Lovato of the Civil Rights Network as he stood_in front of a table arrayed with Nabisco products , including Ritz crackers , Planters peanuts , Certs and Lifesavers candies . &quot; But there are no alternatives to Proposition 187. &quot; Organizers wore red armbands asking , in Spanish and English , &quot; Who ' s next ? &quot; -- an allusion to what some activists call the scapegoating of immigrants in the post-Proposition 187 era . Boycott planners are seeking an apology from RJR Nabisco and a pledge that the corporation will not back candidates who use immigration as a &quot; divisive &quot; issue , Salgado said .</TEXT>
