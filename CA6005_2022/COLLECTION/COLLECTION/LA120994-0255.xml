   <HEADLINE> GINGRICH BACKS DENIAL OF MEDICARE TO WEALTHY ; ENTITLEMENTS : HE ALSO SAYS CONGRESS MUST EVENTUALLY ' LOOK_AT ' WAYS TO KEEP SOCIAL_SECURITY FROM GOING BROKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Acknowledging the need to curb the growth of entitlement programs , incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) said Thursday that wealthy retirees should buy their own health_insurance and that Congress eventually must &quot; look_at &quot; long-term and perhaps painful ways to keep Social_Security solvent . Denying Medicare to retirees with annual incomes of more_than $ 100 # 000 would save the government about $ 6 billion in five years , Gingrich said . During a breakfast interview with reporters , he also expressed regret over having suggested that as_many as one in four White_House staffers had used drugs before joining the Clinton_Administration and over having called President and Mrs . Clinton one-time members of the &quot; counterculture. &quot; The outspoken Georgia Republican said he stands_by his remarks , but added that he should have kept them to himself . &quot; If I had to say it over again , I probably would n ' t say it , &quot; Gingrich said . &quot; I don ' t delight in controversy . I like achievement , &quot; he added , saying that his remarks were routine bumps that one faces during any job change . &quot; I ' m trying to learn a new job , &quot; Gingrich said . Had he not made those remarks , Gingrich acknowledged , &quot; the country might well have been better_off for it. &quot; His comments about Social_Security and Medicare , the tax-financed health_insurance program for the elderly and the disabled , are significant because Republican leaders in recent years have flatly declared Social_Security untouchable and past efforts to restrain Medicare spending have proved politically lethal . Gingrich ' s remarks come as a bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform and Tax Reform is completing a report for Clinton next week -- thus ensuring the issue even greater visibility in the days ahead . Budget experts say Congress will never eliminate the federal_deficit unless it curbs spending on the big entitlement programs that provide guaranteed government benefits to millions of Americans . Gingrich prefaced his suggestion that Congress cannot avoid taking_up the Social_Security funding issue by saying that the retirement_program must remain undisturbed for the foreseeable future , calling the solvency question &quot; a problem . . . somewhere around 25 to 30 years from now. &quot; On the other hand , he added , &quot; the problem of children dying in dumpsters is this evening . The problem of schools that fail to educate is this afternoon . The problem of rethinking the cost of Medicaid is this morning. &quot; Before tackling Social_Security , Gingrich argued , Washington must &quot; earn the trust of the American people &quot; by solving more pressing social and economic problems . And even then , he said , the public must be fully engaged during a search for remedies . Among those already mentioned by the entitlement commission staff are raising taxes and elevating the age for Social_Security eligibility to 70 . &quot; I ' ve talked a lot about the need to have dialogue on the budget where the American people get_to learn all_the data , in_general terms , and the American people get_to participate in the decisions , &quot; Gingrich said . &quot; I think there are a lot of things that you have to look_at over the long_run , &quot; he said . &quot; But I would also assert that in the short run . . . you have to take Social_Security off the table and deal with everything else . And when you finish dealing with everything else , and you ' ve done_it right , you will have earned the trust of the American people to look_at Social Security. &quot; Although Social_Security is in surplus now , projections are that it will run_out of cash_in the year 2029 . Similarly , Medicare ' s hospital trust_fund will go broke_in 2001 under current spending rates . Gingrich did not say how soon Congress should act_on the Medicare shortfall . The reform commission , chaired by Sens . Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) and John C . Danforth ( R-Mo. ) , is to deliver a report to Clinton by Thursday on controlling entitlement programs , which account_for 47 % of the budget but threaten to consume nearly all federal spending by the next century . On other issues Thursday , Gingrich sounded both conciliatory and combative , particularly in discussing the prospects of working with a Democratic President and a Senate that , while dominated by Republicans , has rules that would enable Democrats to derail GOP initiatives -- much as the Republicans did this year while in the minority . He cited the GOP intention to grant Clinton the line-item veto as &quot; a sign of reaching beyond normal partisanship. &quot; &quot; There ' s no ( public ) tolerance for confrontation which is purely partisan or purely personality , &quot; he added . &quot; I don ' t think we should ever pick a fight with the President of the United States if it ' s avoidable . And I don ' t think we should ever shrink_from a fight if it ' s necessary. &quot; As for the Senate , Gingrich said that he does not believe Democrats will resort_to parliamentary tactics to stymie the GOP agenda . That , he said , would be &quot; fairly irrational &quot; behavior given the drubbing the Democrats took at the polls last month . &quot; The American people are tired_of gridlock . . . tired_of a decentralized , diffused system that can ' t make any decision and where every small baron has enough influence that they can say no but nobody has enough influence to say yes , &quot; Gingrich said . &quot; I think what they don ' t want is a bunch of very well-meaning and sincere people who can ' t even call a huddle. &quot; ' Contract With America ' * The full text of the Republican &quot; contract with America &quot; is available on the TimesLink on-line service .
