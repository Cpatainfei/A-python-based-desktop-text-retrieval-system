   <HEADLINE> DEUKMEJIAN TO REPRESENT INSURER BEFORE HIGH_COURT ; LAW : EX-GOVERNOR APPOINTED FIVE OF SEVEN JUSTICES WHO WILL HEAR THE CASE . HE IS ARGUING TO HAVE A FORMER BACKER ' S SURETY FIRM EXEMPTED FROM PROP . 103 RATE ROLLBACKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Gov . George Deukmejian , now a lawyer in private practice , has signed_on to represent an insurance_company owned by his onetime leading campaign contributor in a case pending before the California Supreme Court , five of whose seven members he appointed . The insurer , Northridge-based Surety Co . of the Pacific , is fighting , along with the rest of the industry , to get the Supreme Court to uphold a 1990 law -- which Deukmejian signed -- that exempts surety companies from the rate rollbacks required by Proposition 103 . Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield said Deukmejian ' s involvement is &quot; a threat to the integrity of the judicial branch. &quot; He asserted that this instance would be the first time a former governor represented a law client before the California Supreme Court . &quot; I don ' t see how the court can properly face a guy who ' s been either a law partner , an employer or a benefactor of five of them , &quot; Rosenfield said . Deukmejian appointed Chief_Justice Malcolm M . Lucas and Justices Edward A . Panelli , Joyce L . Kennard , Armand Arabian and Marvin R . Baxter . Lucas is a former law partner of Deukmejian and Baxter a former aide . The other two justices , Stanley Mosk and Ronald M . George , were appointed by Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown Sr . and Gov . Pete Wilson , respectively . Deukmejian did not return telephone_calls for comment at his law office with the Los Angeles firm of Sidley &amp; Austin . It is unclear whether Deukmejian will argue the case in_person , but he wrote a four-page letter to the court dated Jan . 19 in which he outlined the reasons why he thought the high_court should hear the case . Last month , in the case of Amwest Surety Insurance Co . vs . Pete Wilson et al , the 2nd District Court of Appeal struck_down the 1990 law in a 2-1 decision . Surety Co . of the Pacific is involved in the case only as a friend_of_the_court , supporting Amwest , but it has a strong financial interest in the outcome . Surety companies provide completion bonds and other kinds of performance guarantees for construction projects , movies and other ventures . It has been estimated that the surety industry as_a_whole will be liable for price rebates of as much as $ 100 million if it is ultimately found to be subject_to Proposition 103 , the 1988 insurance rollback initiative . Surety ' s owner and president , William Erwin , was the leading contributor to Deukmejian ' s 1982 campaign_for_governor , giving $ 203 # 000 . From 1978 through 1989 , Surety Co . contributed $ 243 # 457 to Deukmejian-controlled campaign committees , according to the Fair Political Practices Commission . Erwin hung_up on a reporter seeking comment Monday . Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , in a statement Monday evening , avoided criticizing Deukmejian directly , but said he had faith in the Supreme Court justices &quot; being professionals who can and will ignore the high-powered political pressure of the insurance_companies and will instead decide the case on its merits. &quot; Times staff writer Paul Jacobs in Sacramento contributed to this story .</TEXT>
