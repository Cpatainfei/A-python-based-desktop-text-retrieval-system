   <HEADLINE> CAPITOL JOURNAL : TAKING THE BLINDERS OFF THE POLITICIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The late , legendary Jesse Unruh used to marvel at how perfectly sensible people would get elected to the Legislature and soon after entering the Capitol think they were invisible . The &quot; Big Daddy &quot; Speaker of the Assembly -- who in later years took a lesser job as state_treasurer -- enjoyed musing about legislators becoming so pampered and toadied over by lobbyists and underlings that they believed no ordinary folk could see their carryings-on . Demigods in their own little universe -- a_few blocks of downtown Sacramento -- these lawmakers , Unruh noted , felt they could party and chase women with impunity . Ultimately , some would be arrested for drunk driving or picking_up a prostitute , and they ' d be dumbfounded . Some also would sell their votes or other legislative favors and think nobody was watching . Usually nobody was . However , the FBI began watching in 1986 -- not the partying and chasing , which had slackened since Unruh ' s heyday , but the corruption that had become easier to detect because of modern surveillance tools and disclosure requirements . The FBI watched a lot of people -- legislators , lobbyists and staffers -- including Sen . Frank Hill ( R-Whittier ) . A hidden camera recorded Hill in a hotel_room taking a $ 2 # 500 check and putting it in his pocket . It was handed to him by an undercover_agent posing as a Southern businessman trying to get a bill passed . Hill told the jury that the money was an &quot; honorarium &quot; for &quot; upholding my end of the bargain . . . spending time with him. &quot; The prosecutor said it was a payoff for agreeing to lobby Gov . George Deukmejian on the bill . The jury quickly agreed with the prosecutor and on June 16 convicted Hill of three felonies . That ended an eight-year FBI probe of Capitol corruption . The conviction score : Feds 14 , Pols . Hill and the others weren ' t as invisible as they thought . * Politicians who think they ' re invisible wear blinders that make them oblivious to the real_world . that ' s ironic , given their talent for gauging public sentiment on issues -- reading all those polls and keeping their fingers to the wind . When it comes_to themselves , however , they have a blind_spot . For years , legislators told themselves that if they adhered to certain subtleties -- speaking a political tongue of nuances that relied_on body_language -- they ' d stay within the law . Bribery was virtually impossible to prove , they believed . Wrong . Those were hanging juries at the federal courthouse , buying none of the defendants ' rationalizations . They ' re politicians ; they took the money and put it in their pockets . Case closed . In the Capitol , the legislators who think they ' re invisible now are stunned . The public is a lynch_mob , they complain . The judicial_system is out of control . No politician is safe . They ' re hunkering around Hill , immobilized . * If Hill were a statewide official , he ' d have been stripped of his office after the verdict was read . There is no such penalty for legislators . The convicted senator is being nudged to leave_office , but has indicated that he won ' t until sentencing -- scheduled for Sept . 12 -- or perhaps not until appeals are exhausted . He could be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the Senate , but that hasn ' t happened in 89 years . Hill has evoked more sympathy than three previous senators who were convicted . that ' s because he ' s a mainstream legislator , a popular , regular guy , not a reputed sleazeball like the others . Many legislators can see themselves in Hill ' s place . They also took honorariums -- some of them ethically dubious -- before these income supplements from special_interests were banned in response to the FBI probe . Now we have another case of fancied invisibility . The Senate has removed Hill from all committees . And Hill has volunteered not to cast any floor votes . He and Senate Leader Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) think voting would be inappropriate for a convicted felon . So why then is it appropriate for Hill to take the pay and the perks -- the $ 1 # 000-a-week salary and $ 101-a-day living allowance ? Logically , he should either be allowed to perform a senator ' s duties or be expelled . Otherwise , it ' s simply welfare for legislators . Legislators obviously have an easier time cutting welfare for ordinary people than for one of_their_own . &quot; It is unconscionable to allow him to remain , &quot; says Sen . Leroy F . Greene ( D-Sacramento ) , chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee , who is pushing for Hill ' s expulsion . Greene is one who does not think he is invisible and fully understands what the public sees . Lucky for the Legislature , the radio talk hosts have been focused_on O.J. Simpson .</TEXT>
