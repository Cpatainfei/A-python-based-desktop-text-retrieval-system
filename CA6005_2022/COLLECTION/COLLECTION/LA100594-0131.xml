   <HEADLINE> GOING FOR THE CYCLE ; FOSTER REACHES NEW HEIGHTS ON HIS BIKE IN 49 STATES , BUT 50TH IS A TALL ORDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bicycling along the Great Wall of China made Kevin Foster the big_wheel he always wanted to be . But he soon realized an encore was necessary . Fame is fleeting and sponsors demand results . The Great Wall could be eclipsed only by great heights , Foster figured . So the pony-tailed , 34-year-old with the intrepid , child-like spirit of Forrest Gump spent the last year biking and hiking to the highest natural points of 49 states , an endeavor he calls &quot; American Summits. &quot; Decked_out in stars and stripes and calling himself Captain America , Foster racked_up 30 # 000 miles on a customized Econoline van . He crisscrossed the country chewing Tootsie Pops and Gummy Bears , dodging pesky park rangers in search of one peak experience after another . From July 3 , 1993 , to Aug . 22 of this year he cycled to 34 summits and reached 14 by hiking with his 26-pound , $ 11 # 000 bike strapped to his back . As long as both reached the top together , victory was claimed . At each summit , Foster and the bike were photographed , a bolt of red , white and blue waving in the wind . Foster , a former actor who has never cycled competitively , lives for encores , each more ambitious than the next . &quot; My mom said to me , ' All you have to do is ask and the worst anybody will do is say no. ' &quot; he said . &quot; But she never knew I would ask_for such outrageous things. &quot; Foster overcame red_tape and the Red Army to reach the Great Wall_in 1990 after five years of trying ; he braved 120-degree Gobi_Desert heat and something called &quot; Nine Dragon-Gate Pass &quot; to complete the 1 # 174-mile trek in 50 days . Problems ranging from a head injury sustained when he was hit by a truck to the student protests and massacre outside Tian An Men Square caused Foster to postpone the trip four times . When he finally pulled it off , he earned a Cyclist of the Year Award from Bicycling magazine . The Great Wall ride was itself an encore . Foster holds a Guinness world_record set_in 1989 for riding the entire New York subway system in the shortest time -- 26 hours 21 minutes 8 seconds . Athletic feats or publicity stunts ? Foster is an enigma , at once a tenacious achiever and tireless self-promoter who has endeared himself to a cycling industry sorely in need of a marquee name other_than Greg LeMond . Foster ' s 20-plus sponsors gladly financed the Great Wall ride and American Summits tour . &quot; People admire him for what he is doing , &quot; said Phyllis McCullough , marketing director for Klein mountain bicycles . &quot; He ' s a great adventurer . The Great Wall ride gave him credibility . When he says he will do something , he does it. &quot; Next year Foster plans to cycle across Cuba &quot; in the name of peace and goodwill. &quot; Then , he says , he will shoot_for the moon , a vision formed on a clear night in Mongolia outside the Great Wall . &quot; The moon was so huge it seemed I could walk over and step aboard , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d like to take a bike up there and do fantastic wheelies on the Sea of Tranquillity. &quot; Foster claims a shocking experience at age 8 is responsible_for his eccentric nature . To be exact , 65 # 000 volts and 30 amps worth of shock after he grabbed a high-tension wire while climbing a tree . He fell 30 feet and spent four years in a wheelchair . &quot; The electricity erased the first eight years of my life , wiped it clean , &quot; he said . &quot; I had to relearn everything . I ' m Peter_Pan . I don ' t want to slow_down . I appreciate things others take_for granted. &quot; As for his lunar plan , Foster pitched it to NASA without a second_thought . &quot; What makes_it funny is that it was serious , &quot; he said . &quot; They thought I was a nut , but I was a nut who had cycled the Great Wall of China . I met with a_couple_of engineers and asked , ' What ' s it gonna take_to get me and my bike on the moon ? ' &quot; Answer : $ 5 billion , three years of training as an astronaut and a 180-pound bicycle to compensate for diminished gravity . A more realistic goal is reaching the 20 # 320-foot peak of Mt . McKinley to complete American Summits . The mountain is climbed rather routinely , but hikers fail to reach the peak routinely as well -- sometimes losing their lives . Eleven people died climbing Mt . McKinley in 1993 , including nine in May , according to the National_Park_Service . About half of the 2 # 000 or so who try the climb annually make_it . McKinley is more unforgiving than the highest peaks Foster has scaled -- Mt . Whitney , Mt . Elbert and Mt . Rainier , each of which tops out at a little more_than 14 # 000 feet . Foster , who blames his divorce last year on his obsession with American Summits , will head for the_hill of hills sometime next summer . &quot; I ' m not saying exactly when because I don ' t want rangers to stop me , &quot; he said . * Some observers believe Foster is his own worst enemy . His doubters include Wendy Campbell , a free-lance photographer who accompanied him on the first eight climbs in July , 1993 . They parted after a disagreement . &quot; Kevin has no sense for the landscape and he doesn ' t pay_attention , &quot; she said . &quot; He could get lost in a paper bag. &quot; Campbell and Willie Treese , a 16-year-old who helped carry supplies , were angered when Foster led them to the wrong peak in Utah . &quot; We got_to the top and I pointed to the next mountain and said , ' I think that one ' s higher , ' &quot; said Campbell , who added that they climbed_down , then trekked up King ' s Peak , the proper summit at an elevation of 13 # 528 feet . Foster admits to the gaffe , and points_out that the integrity of the project was preserved by climbing to King ' s Peak . Foster also made a wrong turn descending Humphreys Peak in Arizona , the first summit they scaled , and a search-and-rescue team found him huddled under a fallen tree at 3 a.m. &quot; that ' s where my troubles started , &quot; said Campbell , who nevertheless has kept_in contact with Foster and applauds his doggedness . Even those who dismiss the American Summits effort as a mountain-sized ego boost acknowledge that Foster is focusing attention on a political struggle between mountain bikers and hikers . The Wilderness Act of 1964 stipulates that &quot; no form of mechanical transport &quot; be allowed_in National wilderness areas , which include several state high points . Mountain_bike enthusiasts say the law is outdated . The Sierra Club recently met with the International Mountain_Bike Assn . and agreed for the first time that mountain biking is a legitimate form of trail usage . &quot; Some things Kevin has done have helped ( the plight of mountain_bike riders ) , &quot; said Bill Strickland , managing editor of Bicycling magazine . Strickland pointed_out Foster ' s ordeal reaching Brasstown Bald , the high point of Georgia . Foster was prohibited by rangers from riding his bike the last half-mile , despite the fact the road was paved and buses were transporting tourists to the summit . &quot; This was so embarrassing , &quot; Foster said . &quot; I slung an assembled bike over my shoulder and was hiking_up a paved road , with a bus full of tourists passing me. &quot; The walk back_down was worse . &quot; A thunderstorm hit . I could have been back in two seconds if I ' d have hopped_on the bike , but I had given my word , so I walked down , &quot; he said . &quot; I was soaked to the skin , and there goes the bus of tourists passing me , bone dry. &quot; At Mt . Rainier in Washington on Aug . 19 , 1993 , Foster was less amenable . He and two companions were met at the base of the mountain by three rangers , who said they had received a fax from the National_Park_Service barring Foster from making the climb with a bicycle -- even strapped to his back . A rancorous exchange finally ended with Foster leaving the bike wheels behind . &quot; The photos ( at the summit ) look ridiculous , me sitting on a frame , &quot; he said . Despite his difficulties , Foster believes that in seeking each high point he has found America . * In Kempton , Okla. , near the Black Mesa summit , Foster signed autographs for the entire town , population 23 . &quot; Somebody ' s aunt was visiting from Arkansas , so I actually signed 24 , &quot; Foster said . * Reaching the summit of Granite Peak , Mont. , required scaling a sheer 500-foot cliff . Foster hired a mountain climbing guide from nearby Jackson Hole , Wyo. , and made the top moments before a terrifying thunderstorm hit . The guide , Steve Walker , pointed_out that the bike attracted lightening and quickly had Foster rappel down the cliff . &quot; The Lord loves and blesses fools and little children , so I am doubly blessed , &quot; Foster said . * Moments after being photographed on the peak of Mt . Arvon , Mich. , reached following a perilous drive on logging roads in thick mud , Foster was startled by a blue Cadillac whipping into the turnout . &quot; Who else would be crazy enough to do this ? &quot; Foster thought . Out of the car stepped an Elvis Presley impersonator . &quot; Captain America meets Elvis on Mt . Arvon ! &quot; Foster said . &quot; He was showing his girlfriend the high point of Michigan . He said he came_up there all_the time . &quot; Hey , that ' s the tour . that ' s America . that ' s what makes it. &quot; Foster ' s definition of patriotism comes_down to this : freedom to pursue his dreams , however bizarre they may be . His dreams are financed by corporate America , and that is key to the definition . &quot; What he ' s doing is amazing , and that ' s why we sponsor him , &quot; said Don Davis of Bell Helmets , who provided Foster with his van . &quot; I actually thought that somewhere along the line he would get disillusioned and quit , but he is kind of obsessed. &quot; Home_in Kaweah , Ca. , where he moved last year after living for several years in Ojai , Foster is plotting his next move . He admits that getting rich -- which has not yet occurred -- is part of his plan . He casually tosses around ideas for expeditions that would make most people ' s knees weak : Cycling Mt . Fuji , or Mt . Kilimanjaro , or the Grand_Canyon , or the Appalachian Trail . &quot; He is not a competitive cyclist , yet he is doing things an ordinary person would n ' t think_of doing , &quot; said Strickland , editor of Bicycling magazine . &quot; Some of his rides are strenuous , but certainly it ' s not like winning the Tour de France . &quot; that ' s part of what makes what he does appealing . Anybody could do these things if they got_off the couch and put their mind to it , but only Kevin has done them. &quot; Foster ' s latest obsession will not end until Mt . McKinley is scaled . &quot; I had a talk with the Lord and said , ' Don ' t let me do 49 states and hold_back one , ' &quot; Foster said . &quot; I will get McKinley. &quot;</TEXT>
