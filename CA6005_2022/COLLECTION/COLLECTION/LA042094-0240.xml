   <HEADLINE> THE BOSNIA DILEMMA ; U.S. TO SEEK NATO ALLIES ' SUPPORT FOR BEEFED-UP THREATS AGAINST SERBS ; MILITARY : POLICY WOULD INCLUDE WIDER AIR STRIKES AS WELL AS TOUGHER SANCTIONS . IT DEPENDS_ON ASSENT FROM EUROPEANS , RUSSIANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration will seek European and Russian support for new military and diplomatic pressure against Serbian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina , including wider air strikes against military targets and stiffer economic sanctions against Belgrade , U.S. officials said Tuesday . Administration officials hope that a new series of threats and a tightening of the economic screw will induce the Bosnian Serbs to forfeit territory won by force and return to the bargaining table . So far , the Bosnian Serbs -- with support from their staunch allies in Serbia -- have not been intimidated by limited North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes and have repeatedly broken diplomatic promises to cease assaults on Bosnian Muslims . The new Administration policy , like all_of its previous policies , depends_on allied assent to the use of broad military power and goodwill on the part of the Bosnian Serbs , conditions that have proven elusive despite 15 months of effort . The key to the latest Administration proposal , announced after three hours of White_House meetings among Clinton and his top foreign_policy advisers , appears to be an increased willingness by Moscow to lean heavily on its traditional Serbian allies to withdraw from the besieged town of Gorazde and abide_by cease-fire agreements elsewhere in Bosnia . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Monday asked the United States and its NATO allies to prepare to deliver a series of air_attacks on Bosnian Serb targets in the wake of the assault on Gorazde , one of six Bosnian Muslim towns declared safe areas by the United Nations last spring . A senior official said the new Administration proposal will be &quot; responsive &quot; to Boutros-Ghali ' s request for increased use of force in Bosnia but will also seek European and Russian participation in a diplomatic initiative designed to quell the conflict in the former Yugoslav federation . &quot; It is very important here that we combine the military and power relationships on the ground with the diplomatic ( initiatives ) , &quot; said a senior Administration official , trying to portray the latest Bosnia policy as more muscular than its previous incarnations . &quot; The use of power without diplomatic ends is purposeless , and the use of diplomacy without power will fail , &quot; the official added . Another foreign_policy official said the immediate focus will be to pressure or punish Bosnian Serb forces to force them to lift the siege of Gorazde , which is jammed with vulnerable Bosnian Muslim refugees from the surrounding countryside . Gorazde was essentially in Serbian control on Tuesday , and a State_Department official described conditions there as &quot; awful. &quot; If the siege is lifted , Washington then hopes to establish an &quot; exclusion zone &quot; around the city that would force the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw all guns to a safe distance and to allow aid convoys into the city , as was done around Sarajevo earlier this year . The protections would then be extended_to other safe areas -- the Bosnian towns of Tuzla , Srebrenica , Bihac and Zepa . A senior American official summarized the Clinton proposal as including two parts : a beefed-up military plan to protect the safe areas coupled with a diplomatic effort to get the negotiations going . He said there is also &quot; an effort to get Serbia to focus_on its responsibilities . We ' re hoping the Russians will help on that. &quot; The plan includes a major effort to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to release the more_than 100 U.N. peacekeepers they have detained . One option , according to a U.S. official , is to warn the leaders of Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs that the West will hold them personally responsible_for the fate of the detained peacekeepers . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher began contacting top allied and Russian officials Tuesday night to outline the Administration proposal . Christopher might travel_to Europe next week to try to restart the stalled Bosnian peace talks . NATO ambassadors were to take_up the American_plan beginning this morning in Brussels ; the United States also will discuss with its major allies and Russia whether to hold an international conference at a higher level . Clinton said in a brief statement that he was encouraged by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s tougher tone in discussing the behavior of the Bosnian Serbs . Yeltsin also proposed a high-level meeting to urgently address the political and humanitarian disaster in Bosnia . &quot; I presume from his statement today that he ' s sufficiently concerned about what ' s happened in the last couple of days ( in Gorazde ) that he thinks maybe we ought to go_ahead and do_it now , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I think it deserves serious consideration , and I want to discuss it with him and with the other nations that would be involved. &quot; Clinton , mindful of the failure of past policy proposals from Washington , also said , &quot; We simply must_not be_on record in favor of any policy we are not prepared to follow_through on. &quot; The tenor of Tuesday ' s exchanges seemed to reflect two bedrock American principles : There will be no unilateral American military_action against Serbia or the Bosnian Serbs , and there will be no commitment of U.S. ground forces until there is an enforceable peace agreement among all_the warring parties . Clinton appears to be willing to risk a handful of American pilots in a stepped-up air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs but has no stomach -- and little political or public support -- for the use of U.S. infantry . The American public narrowly supports the use of air_power in Bosnia but overwhelmingly opposes the dispatch of ground troops . Times staff writer Doyle McManus contributed to this report .</TEXT>
