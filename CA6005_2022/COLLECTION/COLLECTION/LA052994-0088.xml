   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / ROBERT EISNER : IN FED ' S INFLATION AMBUSH , RECOVERY MAY GET SHOT IN THE FOOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s the economy , stupid ! that ' s what matters_to most Americans , but not to our current Federal_Reserve_Board . For them it ' s the rate_of_inflation -- or , I should say , their fears , bordering_on paranoia , as_to what inflation might be . The Fed ' s actions of the last two months , culminating in that half-percentage-point increase in short-term interest_rates May 17 , are risky and wrong . But it is important to understand the premise from which the Fed governors operate -- a premise shared by too many others . It is , simply , that we cannot allow the economy to do too well . Sales must_not be too brisk , production too high , growth too rapid or the unemployment_rate too low . Otherwise we will have high inflation -- indeed , accelerating inflation , inflation going_up and up and up . The inflation_rate as measured by the consumer_price_index was all_of 0.1 % in April . Productivity has been rising faster than wages , so labor costs have been falling . International and domestic competition are fierce . Yet , because unemployment is all_the way down to 6.4 % -- too low by the Fed ' s standards -- and growth has been slightly ahead of a meager target rate of 2.5 % , the Fed sees the economy as &quot; overheating &quot; and in need of cooling off if inflation is to be stopped . How is the Fed supposed to do this ? By raising interest_rates , it figures it will reduce borrowing for new houses , consumer_durables such_as automobiles and business investment . that ' s the theory . We can only hope -- along with President Clinton , apparently -- that the economy is so strong that it won ' t work . If it does , we will be enjoying fewer new homes and cars and there will be less investment in plants and equipment for our future . And the job losses in the industries most directly affected will spill_over to the rest of the economy . The unemployed consumer can ' t buy much . And the more of them there are , the more all business suffers . But that ' s precisely the Fed ' s idea . We have to make business scramble for_sales and keep prices down because of excess capacity . Firms must_not bid up wages and other labor costs by trying to hire workers in short supply . That , the Fed says , will stop inflation . But this &quot; cure &quot; for a disease of which we currently have no symptoms may strike many as severe . There has been another twist on the argument , popular in some Wall_Street circles . According to this variant , the Fed -- by raising short-term interest_rates and showing it means business about fighting inflation -- would reduce market expectations of inflation . This , in turn , would depress long-term interest_rates , which are related to such expectations . In fact , interest_rates had been falling , with the Fed ' s encouragement of lower short-term rates , until February . And this had certainly contributed , as intended , to economic recovery . It was precisely when the Fed reversed course , announcing that it was raising short-term rates to combat inflation , that long-term rates went_up again . The faces of many of those Wall_Street analysts should be red with embarrassment , for this is just what should have been expected . Whatever anyone thinks_about future inflation , long-term interest_rates depend_on expectations of future short-term rates . By signaling in February that the Fed ' s priorities had changed -- that the governors were no longer keeping rates low to encourage economic_growth , but were raising interest_rates and were prepared to continue raising them to slow the economy -- Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan created a whole new ballgame . Investors now would have to reckon with higher rates into the indefinite future . Of course , bond prices promptly plunged and long-term interest_rates rose . This can only spell danger for the economy . In advancing his drastic deficit-reduction package , President Clinton looked_to low interest_rates to compensate for the depressing effects of tight fiscal_policy . As long as the Fed was cooperating , this seemed to work . Housing , automobile sales and business investment boomed . The more prosperous economy actually narrowed the deficit more_than had been expected . Current forecasts have the 1994 deficit so small that the debt-to-GDP ratio will no longer be growing -- fiscal balance , in a relevant economic sense . Now , though , real reductions in the underlying structural deficit -- as opposed to reductions due_to a growing economy and low interest_rates -- are just coming_on stream . They will slow the economy themselves . At this point , the Fed adds its monetary restraint and higher interest_rates to slow it further . That may be what the current Federal_Reserve_Board wants . Do the rest of us ?</TEXT>
