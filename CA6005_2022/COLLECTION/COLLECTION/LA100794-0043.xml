   <TEXT> After several hours at the computer trying to beat the last level of &quot; Doom , &quot; you might get the urge to check_out what ' s happening in the great outdoors . In the old days , you had to either let that urge pass or actually get_up from your chair and go outside . But no more . Now , if you have a modem , there is an astonishing amount of up-to-date weather information that can be accessed through on-line services . And if you have access via your workplace or school to the Internet , you can get worldwide weather_maps , satellite pictures , forecasts and more technical meteorological data than you probably care about for free . The easiest way to obtain weather information on-line is through the commercial services . On CompuServe , you simply click on the little weather icon ( if you ' re using one of their handy graphic interfaces -- otherwise , you just write &quot; go weather &quot; ) and up pops the current forecast for the area you choose . Choose Los Angeles , for example , and you get separate forecasts from the National Weather Service for the Downtown / beach areas and the San Fernando / San Gabriel valleys . The day this column appears , according to that forecast , it ' s supposed to be mostly clear with light winds and highs ranging from the mid 70s at the beaches to the 80s in the valleys . CompuServe also provides a &quot; Climatological Report , &quot; showing current weather_conditions and bits of historical information , including the record highs and lows for the day . For cities outside the United States , CompuServe gives you access to forecasts made by the commercial Accu-Weather service ( it ' s supposed to be partly sunny today in Tokyo with a high of 84 ) . But that ' s just the beginning of CompuServe ' s justifiably heralded weather features . You can also get printouts of extended forecasts , weather alerts , precipitation probability charts , marine forecasts for boaters and ( for an extra fee ) aviation forecasts . Finally , you can view numerous weather_maps and satellite pictures that are updated regularly . From a satellite in geostationary_orbit that allows a constant view of the southwestern United States , came pictures earlier this week clearly showing the clouds that brought us welcome rain_showers . Weather information is also available on America On Line , but it ' s neither as detailed nor as easy to find or view . Maps and satellite pictures must be downloaded to your computer before you can view them . AOL does have a lively weather discussion area for the truly climatologically obsessed . Recent messages included a debate about what area of the United States has the worst weather ( Mt . Washington , N.H. , got a lot of votes ) and the best ( many nominated San Diego ) . There were also numerous weather jokes including the old standby about the forecast for South_America ( &quot; Chile today and hot tamale &quot; ) and several of the it-was-so-cold variety ( &quot; It was so cold in D.C. that the politicians had their hands in their own pockets ! &quot; ) . Let ' s move_on . You have to work a bit to get weather info on the Internet , but if you are fascinated by the topic , it is certainly the place to be . The best known spot is the &quot; Weather Machine &quot; area maintained by the University of Illinois and founded with grants from the National Science Foundation and other agencies . Once at that Internet site , I was able to get detailed National Weather Service forecasts for the Los Angeles area , plus a climatological summary that included accumulated precipitation for the season as compared to past seasons ( especially important data for us in Southern California ) . There were also extended forecasts , a visibility report , wind advisories and marine summaries . The &quot; Weather Machine &quot; also offers an ample variety of weather_maps , satellite pictures , radar images and surface pictures . In its archives are pictures of hurricanes and other major events . With the appropriate on-line search tools , you can then travel from Illinois to weather information sites around the world on the Internet , including European sites where you can download spectacular images from the Meteosat satellite that are processed by the Department of Meteorology at the University of Edinburgh . You can spend so many hours exploring the weather of the world that you might even temporarily forget about &quot; Doom. &quot; You need never leave the house again .</TEXT>
