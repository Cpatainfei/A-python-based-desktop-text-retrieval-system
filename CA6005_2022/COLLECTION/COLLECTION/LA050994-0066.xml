   <HEADLINE> MICHIGAN ' S MEDICAL SOCIETY SIDESTEPS DEBATE ON ASSISTED SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Medical Society reaffirmed without debate Sunday its opposition to doctor-assisted suicide in most cases , angering some members who wanted to air their differences . With Michigan ' s own Jack Kevorkian at the center of a national debate , leaders of the 11 # 700-member group expected more of a battle . &quot; I ' m extremely upset . Through our inaction we ' re allowing Kevorkian to dominate the debate , &quot; said Dr. Louis Zako , a delegate . Kevorkian was acquitted last week of violating a state law that bans assisted suicide . Under the Medical Society ' s reaffirmed policy , a physician is allowed to help a patient to commit suicide only after all other options are exhausted . The delegates voted 85 to 32 to reaffirm the policy .</TEXT>
