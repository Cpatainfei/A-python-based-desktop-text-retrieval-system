   <HEADLINE> HORDES HOT-FOOT IT TO THE BEACH ; WEATHER : IT ' S COOLER ON PACKED SHORES , BUT EVEN OCEAN IS WARM . IT STILL BEATS INLAND AREAS , SUFFERING RECORD-HIGH TEMPERATURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A second day of record-breaking temperatures and high humidity sent thousands of sweltering Orange County residents to the slightly cooler ocean Friday for an early start on what is likely to be a big beach weekend . Triple-digit temperatures were recorded in Anaheim , 102 ; Santa Ana , 100 ; El Toro , 101 , and Fullerton , 100 . Santa Ana ' s previous record for the date was 98 , set_in 1991 . At the coast , cooler temperatures in the air nearly matched that of the water . From Huntington Beach to the San Clemente Pier , the air temperature hovered around 78 degrees , while in Laguna Beach the temperatures nosed into the mid-80s . Even the surf temperature Friday was an unseasonably high 72 to 73 degrees . Waves of two to four feet are forecast for today . In fact , the warmer ocean temperature is directly related to the heat_wave , according to Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . &quot; Basically there ' s no marine layer . that ' s why things are so toasty , &quot; he said . &quot; The warm waters are not allowing a sufficient marine layer to build to keep things cool . &quot; In Laguna Beach , about 30 # 000 people went_to the shore , up from a typical Friday summer crowd of 20 # 000 , according to lifeguard Lt . Mark Klosterman . &quot; A lot of people are just down to cool_off , &quot; Klosterman said , &quot; and most found their way to the water . It ' s what we call a palm-tree , Popsicle day : so pleasant you want to sit beneath a palm_tree with a Popsicle. &quot; &quot; How is it here ? &quot; said Newport Beach lifeguard Lt . Eric Bauer . &quot; Hot today , hot tomorrow and hot the next day . It ' s just plain hot ! &quot; The Newport Beach was extremely crowded for a weekday , Bauer said : about 85 # 000 , compared to the usual 40 # 000 to 60 # 000 . &quot; Because of the high_temperatures and humidity , everyone is playing hooky and ditching work and all that stuff to come here. &quot; &quot; It ' s muggy and it ' s hot , &quot; said Seal Beach Lt . Steve Cushman , looking_forward to the increased crowds drawn by the heat and the Miller Lite Pro Beach Volleyball tournament , which began Friday and runs_through Sunday . &quot; People are behaving themselves , &quot; Cushman said . &quot; I think it ' s so hot , people don ' t want to move_around so_much , and if they do , it ' s for the water. &quot; Brack , the meteorologist , said there is little relief in_sight for Orange County over the weekend . He predicted partly cloudy and muggy weather with a slight chance of thundershowers , mostly in the afternoon and evening . &quot; It will probably remain fairly humid because of all_the tropical moisture from Hurricane Ileana , &quot; now near the southern tip of Baja , Brack said . The highs today are expected to range from the mid-70s at the beaches to the 100s inland . The lows should range from the mid-60s to the lower 70s . &quot; We ' re having some unusually warm low_temperatures , &quot; Brack noted . Los Angeles also had a record high_temperature of 104 degrees Friday , while warm tropical air caused heavy thunderstorms , lightning , brush_fires and a rare tornado warning in rugged portions of Riverside County , forecasters said . Lightning touched_off a 480-acre fire in the sparsely populated Cactus Valley area near Hemet , at one point threatening about a dozen homes and a camp attended by about 150 children , said Bonnie O ' Connell , a spokeswoman for the Riverside County Fire_Department . No injuries were reported . By midafternoon , those homes were no longer threatened , O ' Connell said . A second fire , about a mile away , consumed about an acre , and a smaller fire believed caused by downed power_lines destroyed a mobile_home in the back yard of a house in southeast Hemet , O ' Connell said . &quot; We ' ve got a lot of fires going_on . . . small fires caused by the downed lines and lightning strikes , &quot; she said . Heavy rains and isolated flooding damaged several houses and cars . A funnel cloud was reported at one point , though apparently it did not touch_down , the National Weather Service said . A tornado warning was in_effect through 4 p.m. Other high_temperatures included 104 in Los Angeles , 110 in Monrovia , 109 in San Gabriel , 107 in Woodland Hills and Van Nuys , 106 in Burbank , 105 in Montebello , 104 in Pasadena and 100 in Long_Beach . Baruffaldi attributed the continuing heat to a high_pressure system to the east , which is blocking normal air flows and allowing warm air to move_up from the south and southwest . &quot; It ' s preventing the usual cooler air from . . . coming_off the ocean , &quot; he said . &quot; Instead , we ' re having tropical air . . . which is warm_to begin with . Since we ' re staying warm overnight , it doesn ' t take long for us to heat_up and reach these record highs. &quot; Thunderstorms were expected to continue for several days in mountainous inland areas , although there was no threat of tornadoes , he said . Times staff writer David Ferrell contributed to his report .</TEXT>
