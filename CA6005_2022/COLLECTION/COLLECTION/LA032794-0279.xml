   <HEADLINE> IN CUBA , LIFE UNDER CASTRO IS DISSOLVING ; ECONOMY : EVEN BEING GOVERNMENT LOYALISTS ISN ' T ENOUGH FOR FAMILY TO HAVE LEVEL OF EXISTENCE THEY SEEK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ena Santamaria ' s home is a theater showing the daily life of Cuba , a microcosm of a land that combines sadness and joy , promise and disillusion , dreams and reality . It is a tiny room , formerly the entry to what had been a three-bedroom house in Miramar , which was the neighborhood of Cuba ' s elite before Fidel Castro officially ended social distinctions . Ena , a clerk in a store catering to foreigners and Cubans with dollars , is lucky to live_in lovely , embassy-dotted Miramar , even in overcrowded conditions in a house that looks abandoned , so overgrown is its yard , so shabby is the exterior . Ena ' s parents , Marta and Pablo , her two sisters , a brother , two uncles and an assortment of cousins and friends occupy the same house . One day this month Ena , Marta , Pablo and a guest sat side_by_side on the single piece_of_furniture in the room , a couch-bed . &quot; We sleep_in shifts , &quot; Ena said . She shares the couch with a sister at night ; a brother and his wife use it in the early morning . In the dimness of a fading afternoon sun , no lights came_on . Electricity is severely rationed , with most neighborhoods receiving no more_than eight hours a day , two to four hours at a time . During the long summers , the allotment is less . Candles were lighted , and a bottle of rum appeared . Ena and her family are Castro supporters and argue that much of what is wrong in Cuba is the fault of the United States and more_than three decades of the trade_embargo put_in place when Castro established a Communist government . As blacks they said they felt less discrimination than what they read about in the United States , and they spoke proudly about one of Ena ' s brothers who works as &quot; an official &quot; in the Finance Ministry . And the family seemed well-educated and well-informed . All said they could read and write -- Marta and Pablo attended adult literacy classes in 1962 -- and the level of discussion was sophisticated . Yet it was clear from their lifestyle and what they said they needed -- especially food , clothing and transportation -- that being Castro supporters wasn ' t enough to maintain the level of existence they felt they needed . In reality , all_of Cuba seems to be living a life that is dissolving . A tour of the Havana of March , 1994 , is a trip of visual despair . Gracious old homes and office_buildings stand_in near-derelict condition with window glass missing and shutters hanging as if from incomplete amputations . What paint there is droops in strips or clings in patches , the uncovered wood and mortar cracked , rotting and covered with oily grime . Only those structures reserved for tourists , diplomats and a handful of foreign business people are maintained . As Ena ' s home shows , Cuba suffers from a major housing deficit . Houses once inhabited by a single family now are crammed with five families , and often more . Three- and four-member families live_in 45 square_feet of space . Only diplomats , foreigners and privileged Cubans , especially government and Communist_Party officials , enjoy space and privacy . So little gasoline and spare auto parts are available that traffic_jams are unknown . It is safe to walk down the middle of the most important streets without fear of being run_down by anything but Chinese-made &quot; Flying Pigeon &quot; bicycles . Water from a system that has not been upgraded or repaired since the pre-revolutionary days of the 1950s is undrinkable , by government admission . Most restaurants used by ordinary Cubans are closed ( other restaurants exist clandestinely or are open only to tourists ) . Grocery_stores stand empty . Theaters function only on weekends , and only when there is electricity . Cuba is out of almost everything . Meat has long disappeared from the market , as has most vegetables and fruits , baked_goods , milk , eggs , cooking_oil and fuel . A pound of potatoes , if it can be found , costs twice what a minimum-wage worker earns in a day . And what is available is severely rationed . According to a government proclamation covering March , each person will get a quarter pound of cooking_oil , six pounds of rice , 30 ounces of beans , three pounds of sugar and three pounds of evaporated milk for the month . The ration for milk and beans , however , includes portions not delivered in February . Small shares of fresh milk and meat are allotted specially to children and expectant mothers . Even the so-called dollar stores , which serve only foreigners and the relatively few Cubans who can acquire dollars , are facing shortages . One recent Saturday , the baked-goods store serving the wealthy foreign residents of Miramar was out of bread . The cheese department also was empty . Neither had received any products from the central distributing agency . People line_up for nearly everything -- to use phones , enter clothing_stores , buy_food at the infrequently open street stands and , most of all , catch a bus . In every part of Havana , and all along the roads in the countryside , people stand looking expectantly into the distance for a bus . There seems to be no schedule . At one intersection on_the_road south out of Havana , about 75 people waited more_than an hour for a bus . When a smoke-belching dinosaur of an East German-made bus did arrive , it was so jammed that only about eight people were able to cram aboard . People at bus_stops and elsewhere were surprised to meet an American , but when they did they seemed to have only two questions : &quot; Do you like Cuba ? &quot; and &quot; When is the blockade ( as the embargo is called ) going_to end ? &quot; Otherwise , they talked matter-of-factly about their hard lives , but with more resignation than bitterness and often with a risque sense_of_humor . They laughed easily at cautiously humorous remarks about Castro , particularly in reference_to his lengthy speeches and his legendary sexual potency . A visitor is bombarded with offers of a special Cuban pill that &quot; will make you the equal of Fidel in the bedroom. &quot; While there is no evidence of Stalinist-style political repression -- Cubans complain about the shortages and inconveniences even to strangers -- people shy from discussions that raise questions about Castro ' s enormous power or that move toward the possibility of a major change in the system here . This is not to say that freedom of expression exists in any way familiar to Americans or Western Europeans . The United Nations and international private human_rights groups constantly condemn Cuba for abuses . And the media are totally controlled by the state . Diplomats and foreigners living here say the only truly efficient sector of Cuban life is the government ' s large security apparatus . Still , a small human_rights group exists here , and a handful of independent , anti-Castro journalists print pamphlets and semi-underground journals even though what they do is to little effect . &quot; What you have to realize , &quot; said a European diplomat , &quot; is that little by little , Cuba is changing . It is in transition . Castro and his people know that with conditions as bad as they are , they have to create safety_valves to keep the place from blowing_up . &quot; So you even have academics now cautiously discussing the merits of other systems , seeking books even from the United States . It isn ' t a free society , and Castro could always crack_down , &quot; he said . &quot; But right now what the Cubans refer to as ' that old stuff ' seems to be gone. &quot; The safety_valve theory is used by critical diplomats to explain the economic reforms and policies put_in place over the last three years that have eased some problems , particularly gasoline shortages . &quot; They don ' t have any more fuel this month than they did last fall , &quot; said one diplomat . &quot; But they permitted more to be sold , and they put a_few more buses on the streets when they sensed people were becoming seriously frustrated . &quot; They also use this ( tactic ) as a means of control , &quot; he said . &quot; They allow some relaxation , then they pull_back . It ' s manipulation. &quot; There is no sense in Cuba , not even among the few U.S. officials present here , that Castro faces serious opposition or is in danger of falling . &quot; Something could spark a problem , &quot; one Western diplomat said . &quot; A policeman could do something stupid and start a violent reaction , you can ' t dismiss that . But the reality is that Castro is in control and likely will remain so as long as he ' s alive. &quot; And whether by manipulation or because of remaining revolutionary idealism , there are some achievements that allow Castro , 67 , and his supporters to claim continued popular backing . While Cuba was one of the Caribbean ' s best-educated countries even before Castro , with a literacy rate of 86 % in the mid-1950s , he talks proudly of 100 % literacy , of sending every child to school . Cuba ' s educational system separates it from nearly every_other Caribbean and Central_American_country . Attendance is mandatory , and it is enforced . During school hours , children are in classes , not on the streets . There are few of the begging preteen urchins that plague Santo Domingo or Caracas or San Salvador . Population growth is under_control , and infant_mortality remains one of the lowest in the world , because nearly every Cuban has easy , free access to a fully trained doctor . And while life may have collapsed for the middle_class in Cuba , there is little of the abject misery found among large segments of the populations of most other Caribbean and Central_American_nations . But foreign experts say there is a shortage of medicine and school supplies , not to mention amenities that would result from a functioning , modern infrastructure . Last year ' s crucial sugar crop , which is overwhelmingly Cuba ' s main economic engine , was victimized by poor planning and destructive weather and produced only 4.2 million tons by official count . Diplomatic and private sources say it fell closer to 3.5 million tons . Even by the official estimate , sugar was 30 % below predictions , which were some of the lowest in decades . Without a successful sugar crop , and with a soft market for its few other natural_resource products -- even the export of high_quality cigars fell drastically in 1993 and this year -- Cuba is broke . Public transportation is at 10 % of what it was before 1989 , when the collapse of the Soviet_Union and its Communist allies ended billions of dollars in aid and subsidies . Lacking markets , only about 20 % of Cuba ' s industrial capacity is in_use . The government debt is 30 % of the total economy ; average workers earn from $ 13.50 a month to a rare high of $ 30 a month ; the value of exports was under $ 2 billion in 1993 , and imports totaled $ 1.7 billion , half of which was for oil products . Theoretically , there is no unemployment , and every citizen is guaranteed an income . But there is little work available in factories , many of which are closed , and furlough pay and guaranteed wages have been cut dramatically . What earnings there are have been steadily debased by inflation and the introduction of the dollar as a legitimate currency . The arguments are endless about what is to blame for Cuba ' s condition : a romantic political and economic_system driven by an ideology that has collapsed worldwide ; the end of a $ 6-billion-a-year barter and aid relationship with the Eastern European Communist world ; or the unrelenting antagonism , including the three-decades-old economic embargo , of the world ' s most powerful nation toward this country of 10 million people . Regardless of whether the cause is one or all_of those factors , Cuba is unlikely to change much in the near future . Finance_Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia recently spoke_of low-key recovery for 1994 based on improved sugar harvests , higher nickel exports , increased oil availability and growth in tourism . But international economic_experts and diplomats here say Rodriguez ' s modest assessments are in doubt , but even if he is correct it will , as one envoy said , &quot; just keep them from falling further. &quot; &quot; Cuba has no money and no real way of getting any , &quot; an international official here said . &quot; As long as things stay the way they are , the people here will survive , but that is about as optimistic as I can be. &quot;</TEXT>
