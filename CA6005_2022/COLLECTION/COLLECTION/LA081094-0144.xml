   <TEXT> Death we have seen , and by the numbing long_ton . But imagine this other ordeal : being left alone in the world with nothing . Sick , naked , wet in a pool of_your_own uncontrollable excrement , too weak to do anything except tremble . Not a possession , no family or friends , no country , perhaps not even a name you can remember . &quot; And these are the lucky ones . There are thousands out here we haven ' t got_to yet , &quot; says Christian Clark , a 33-year-old UNICEF worker who rolls another Rwandan child from the plastic sheeting of the Munigi camp cholera aid_station onto a prickly blanket . He carries her to a rescue truck . It is 9 a.m. and this is stop No . 1 in the daily_round of the orphan express , the white U.N. Children ' s Emergency Fund truck that rumbles over the sad , teeming landscape of eastern Zaire , scooping_up the children that Rwanda ' s war has abandoned . The frail girl , who might be 8 years old , is placed on the dirty steel floor of the truck . Medical attendants load three more babies in a single blanket . Perhaps 3 to 6 months old , they too are naked . But one has a thin gold chain around her waist -- the only thing she has to carry from this life into the great uncertainty of the next . That is , if someone doesn ' t steal it from her , which is likely in this cruel land . There are only four orphans today at this stop , fewer than usual . Suddenly , a man emerges from the mass of refugees -- everywhere here people are compressed into epic throngs . He hands up a 25-pound girl in a soiled and shapeless blue smock . The last of her known family died and she has been sitting alone for two days , the man explains . She comes_into the truck without protest , standing perfectly still on her hard-bottom feet , eyes as wide with wonder as a child at the gate of Disneyland . She has been watching trucks rumble by on this road ; finally she will see where one goes . Clark hands her a biscuit , which she takes with her good hand . She holds the other as if it ' s hurt . Or maybe it ' s just rigid with tension . The girl stares at you with questions you can never know . She is trembling . She is covered with lice and crusty with filth . A reporter puts an arm around her . &quot; that ' s it , &quot; Clark says . &quot; She ' ll warm_up , you ' ll see . These kids are starved for affection. &quot; Good God , you think , it ' s only 9 a.m. and the rounds are just starting . would n ' t you be pathetic if you couldn ' t hold_back these burning tears in front of this girl ? Next , the airport and the_French army post . Word has already spread among the refugees . Each day , lost and orphaned children who no longer can endure the camps on_their_own learn of the truck_stops . Some parents also hear of the UNICEF rescue . They drop_off a child to lighten their own load . Perhaps they say to themselves : Nothing could be worse than keeping children in the camps , even if that means sending them down the road alone . So far 7 # 400 unaccompanied children have been collected here by relief workers . UNICEF estimates an additional 10 # 000 to 70 # 000 roam alone . Each day , the orphanages exceed their capacity and are expanded farther onto the lava rocks . &quot; We ' ve never , never seen anything like this before . Maybe it ' s happened ( before ) , but we haven ' t seen it , &quot; Clark says . At these stops , the truck collects some older children . One , two and then another . They seem to appear from nowhere . You turn your back , and two have climbed_up and taken a seat on the little school benches that ride unfettered under the canvas top of the truck . The children are_quiet as they accept biscuits and water . Suddenly , two more have moved_in . We drive on , and Clark scrambles back and forth in the bouncing truck_bed , smiling widely and trying to joke with the older children . There are no smiles back just yet , but a faint spark can be seen in their eyes -- perhaps gratitude . A truck ride , a cookie and a hug are more_than these children have had in a long_time . Wearing a dirty jacket and shorts , Joseph Bavurnda says he is 13 -- although he is only half the size of a Western teen-ager , with bony feet and big , curious eyes . &quot; My father died before in Kigali . My mother died with cholera after a one-week walk . I have two little_brothers , but I don ' t know where they are . We became apart at the border. &quot; On the roads , children , some of them very tiny , sit unattended in the dirt . In the teeming centers of the camps , who can know which of the thousands are attended_to and which are not ? Difficult as it is , the truck passes them all by . Surviving refugees are asked to help identify the lost , orphaned and abandoned and bring them to designated pickup sites . No one wants to accidentally take a child whose mother is off looking_for food or water . The next stop is the public hospital in Goma , Zaire , which is considered adequate by African standards . There are two and three patients in each bed , with others lying_in tents and on the ground . Flies and the sharp smells of urine and infection fill the wards . But there seems to be a large medical staff . A scene erupts . A girl who is perhaps 3 has lost her mother to dysentery and adopted another female patient as a surrogate . But the woman explains that she has two children of_her_own and cannot support this child . The girl screams and will not let_go . The surrogate_mother ' s agony shows on her face . A crowd gathers , noisily . Someone yanks the wailing child away . Just this morning , reporters here learned via shortwave broadcast that some Western pundits were criticizing coverage of the refugees as exploitative . The critics should have seen this : the wailing , half-naked child clawing the air furiously for something to hold . And there was the shoulder of Gloria Galloway , a reporter for the Canadian Press news service , herself a mother of three . Her notebook in her pocket , Galloway carried the child back to the orphan express . Two other reporters lifted other children into the now-crowded vehicle and began the feeding chores . Somehow , counting the morning ' s total of orphans was forgotten . Was it 20 , or 30 ? &quot; The last time people fled like this was when Moses parted the Red_Sea , &quot; says Clark , a former scriptwriter for &quot; Sesame Street. &quot; Today ' s children are first taken_to UNICEF headquarters in Goma , the town where relief efforts are coordinated . The children who are old enough to talk are registered here . Workers hope that if and when the outlying camps can be stabilized with food and medicine , at least some parents will come searching for missing children . Then the truck drives to the final stop , the Carea Orphanage outside Goma . This is a tent city of tiny people , where the sick are separated by disease : cholera here , dysentery there , unknown over yonder . The healthy move_on to canvas_tents with floors of plastic sheeting . Here , children_care for other children . And someone has done a good job of it already . A group of 6- or 7-year-old boys charges out of a tent to greet a visitor . With their arms folded , they bow in unison , smile and recite : &quot; Bonjour , papa ! &quot; &quot; Bonjour , boys. &quot; None of them looks when a tiny body is carried_through the orphanage in a blanket . It is placed along the shoulder of the road for a different collection truck . Three days ago at this orphanage , a 5-year-old girl showed_up at the gate with an infant she found along the roadside in the arms of a dead mother . Today , the 5-year-old returned and inquired about the health of &quot; her baby. &quot; The infant died , but an orphanage worker lied and said everything was fine . There are happier stories too , like the listless infant who would not eat or stop crying . A nurse held the dying toddler and happened to feel a bump . A surgeon extracted a bullet that had killed the mother and lodged_in the child . The youngster grew plump_in three days . But what of these children a month from now when the rainy_season turns the ground to mud ? And a year from now when the eyes and hearts of the world have moved elsewhere ? And 20 years after that , when they reach adulthood on this crowded and turbulent continent ? &quot; I don ' t know how these kids will survive emotionally , &quot; says Pat Sheppard , a New Jersey nurse with the relief group AmeriCares . &quot; I can hardly think_about that yet . I only know it ' s not going_to get better for a long while. &quot;</TEXT>
