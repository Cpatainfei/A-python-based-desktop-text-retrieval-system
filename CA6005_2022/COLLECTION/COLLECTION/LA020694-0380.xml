   <HEADLINE> THE GONZALEZ FAMILY STRUGGLED TO FIND ITS MUSICAL NICHE FOR 13 YEARS . NOW , LAVA AND THE HOT ROCKS MAY BE . . . ; READY TO ERUPT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Gonzalezes were tired_of waiting for fame and fortune to arrive for their family band . So tired that they decided to create their own fame using their own fortune . After refinancing their Maywood home and taking the money that Hector Gonzalez received from a company buyout , the family independently produced Lava and the Hot Rocks ' first commercial album last fall . Their gamble may have paid_off . Frustrated with being denied by several record labels , Hector , 40 , his wife , Miroslava ( Lava ) , 38 , and their son , Alex , 18 , changed the band ' s eclectic style to alternative adult contemporary . And with their first , soon-to-be-released album , &quot; You Damn Mexicans Are Too Loud , &quot; the band has found its niche . &quot; It ' s been hard to get_into the Mexican market because they don ' t consider us Latin . Even being of Mexican American heritage , we weren ' t recognized because we aren ' t immigrants , &quot; Hector Gonzalez said . The band began its tumultuous journey through the Los Angeles music scene 13 years ago after Hector Gonzalez ' s barber introduced him to an attorney who recommended their demo album to former concert promoter Jerry Rissmiller . &quot; Musically they knocked me out , &quot; said Rissmiller , who agreed to become their manager . He said their blend of Latin elements and big-band sound leads to a bluesy jazz beat that is commercial and unique in a world where it is &quot; very difficult to get airplay on any radio_station , regardless of ethnicity. &quot; With Hector on bass , Alex on drums and Lava on vocals , the group also features Mel Steinberg , 44 , on saxophone , Alfred Ortiz , 23 , on percussion and Karl Carrasco , 41 , on keyboards . The family writes songs by improvisation . Hector Gonzalez said he comes_up with a rhythm and runs it by his son , who adds his ideas . Then they tape the piece and give it to Lava Gonzalez to write the melody and the lyrics . Hector Gonzales describes themes for the band ' s songs as &quot; home-grown. &quot; Lava Gonzalez said the bluesy songs she sings offer a unique way to discuss life : tales of love , war , pain and relationships . Many of their songs are inspired by her heritage -- she was born in Chinipas , Mexico , and moved to the United States when she was 1 -- and by the family ' s attempts to make_it to the big_time . Hector Gonzalez , who won an Emmy Award as a sound engineer for his work_on the 1984 Olympic Games coverage , said his connections at ABC and CBS allowed the band to make money while it looked_for its niche . Those contacts and some late-night club gigs gave the band exposure during an Academy Awards wrap party and other industry get-togethers . Networking also provided the Gonzalezes with an invitation to be the house band for the new PBS show &quot; Somos Latinos , &quot; which will be produced by Robert Andrade and Associates and may begin taping as early as May . Andrade , who produces and directs KCET-TV Channel 28 ' s &quot; Life and Times , &quot; said Lava and the Hot Rocks has much to offer the music industry because of the &quot; broad spectrum of their musical abilities. &quot; * The band has a busy summer schedule , starting in June with the Troubadours of Folk festival at UCLA . As part of the festival , the band will travel with 35 other acts to Scandinavia and the_Virgin Islands . And in August , Lava and the Hot Rocks will join five other groups on a three-month , 30-city tour . One of the band ' s upcoming local outings will be Feb . 18 at a Red_Cross earthquake relief benefit at the Reseda Country_Club . The Gonzalezes ' struggle for stardom started in 1981 when they began playing small Hollywood venues such_as Carlos ' n Charlie ' s , The Roxy , Club Lingerie and Coconut Teazer . Hector Gonzalez was joined by his wife on his weekly gigs after he had encouraged her to explore her singing talent . Alex Gonzalez , who Lava said had been &quot; banging on pots and pans since he was 18 months old , &quot; began playing drums with the band at age 5 . Alex Gonzalez also found some daytime acting and drumming work_on the sets of the television_shows &quot; Punky Brewster &quot; and &quot; Simon &amp; Simon. &quot; His parents hired his aunt to shuttle him from the TV studios to school and then to the clubs the family played_at night . &quot; It was so tough on all_of us , because the only time we got_to spend together was when we were playing as Lava and the Hot Rocks , &quot; said Hector Gonzalez . Lava Gonzalez said the family has stuck_together even when job , parenting and performing responsibilities seemed overwhelming : &quot; We ' re all together . Hector ' s not in prison , Alex has never been in a gang . I think we send_out a positive message to the Latino community. &quot;</TEXT>
