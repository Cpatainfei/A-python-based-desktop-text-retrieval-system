   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT ' S PLANS FOR WINDOWS RATTLE THE COMPUTER_INDUSTRY ; TECHNOLOGY : SOME SAY THE SOFTWARE GIANT IS USING ITS MUSCLE TO FORCE A SWIFT CHANGE TO ITS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Microsoft Corp . shifts gears , the vibrations are felt in every corner of the computer universe , from Silicon_Valley to Tokyo to New York . that ' s what is happening now . The software giant on Thursday set_in_motion a sweeping plan to move about 60 million users of its Windows software to a new , easier-to-use personal_computer operating system_called Windows 95 . &quot; This may be one of the most important releases ever done_in the PC industry , &quot; said Paul Maritz , senior_vice_president of Microsoft ' s systems division . &quot; We could easily have 30 million copies go_out in the first year. &quot; If Microsoft succeeds with its new product , just about everyone who uses a personal_computer that isn ' t an Apple Macintosh will eventually be a customer -- and just about every software company in the world will be forced to adapt to a new , Microsoft-defined universe . If Windows 95 doesn ' t live_up_to its billing as a slick , easy-to use program , however , it could create major headaches for users and software developers , and sully Microsoft ' s reputation . It might also open the way for competitors -- notably IBM Corp. , which is readying a surprisingly potent upgrade of its much-maligned OS / 2 PC operating system . Already , Microsoft has had plenty of problems with its new product , which was code-named Chicago and officially renamed Windows 95 on Thursday . Originally scheduled for release at the end of 1993 , Windows 95 now won ' t be available until as late as May of 1995 -- and many potential customers won ' t be using it until 1996 . Some analysts also say the software will require far more power and memory than most people now have_on their computers . &quot; The road to Chicago will prove to be a long and rocky one , &quot; said Will Zachmann , president of Canopus Research in Duxbury , Mass . But Microsoft on Thursday assured reporters that Windows 95 would be so_much easier to use it would help tap a massive new market for home computer users around the globe -- including as_many as 50 million Chinese households now wealthy enough to buy personal_computers . Many applications can be started with a single click , and the software is designed to automatically adjust to different brands of hardware , making setup easier , said Brad Chase , a general_manager for personal operating systems at Microsoft . &quot; Our goal is to make_it as easy to use as toasting a bagel , &quot; he said . When pressed , Chase admitted the new software would n ' t be quite as easy as pressing the lever on a toaster . &quot; It won ' t be nirvana , but we ' ll take you a long way toward the promised land , &quot; he said . Such statements from Microsoft have set high expectations that could easily be disappointed . Many industry insiders and competitors , for starters , are unimpressed . &quot; It ' s 10-year-old technology , &quot; said Don Norman , a senior Apple Computer researcher who says Windows 95 is where Macintosh was when it first came_out . &quot; Chicago is the best thing that ever happened to us , &quot; added Wally Casey , director of marketing for IBM ' s personal software_products division . Casey said customers and software vendors have already begun to regard IBM ' s new version of OS / 2 , dubbed &quot; Warp , &quot; as a better product and an easier upgrade path than Windows 95 . But Microsoft ' s enormous marketing muscle virtually guarantees that it will sell tens of millions of copies of Windows 95 . And the software companies that write applications_programs for PCs are loath to bet against Microsoft . Firms such_as Lotus lost sales because they didn ' t write software for Windows when it first came_out , and they won ' t make the same mistake again . &quot; Every major vendor has learned their lesson . They will all have Chicago versions out as fast as humanly possible , &quot; said Jeff Tarter , publisher of Softletter , a Watertown , Mass . industry newsletter . Microsoft is speeding the transition to the new products by disparaging its existing Windows product as difficult to use and obsolete . To further accelerate the switch_over , the company is requiring that software take_advantage of key features of Windows 95 and be compatible with another Microsoft operating system , Windows NT , before it is allowed to use the Windows logo . That tactic has angered some software vendors , who say Microsoft is using its market power to prop_up the failed Windows NT software and to push users into the Windows 95 world . But Microsoft , which recently agreed to change some of its licensing practices to avert a government antitrust lawsuit , is now feeling free to use its enormous clout . The Windows 95 launch will be accompanied by the biggest advertising_campaign in the company ' s history . And Microsoft demonstrated its sway over the industry by including rival Novell Inc. , as well as Hewlett-Packard Co . and Sony Corp. , in its announcement Thursday . &quot; This product will have a profound impact in the computer world , &quot; said Patty Kim , a Sony marketing manager who claimed the new Windows product would make_it easier to use PCs that incorporate Sony ' s CD-ROM_drives . Still , Microsoft won ' t rely_on its market power alone to get_it through the transition . The company , which has become famous for releasing first versions of software that are_full of bugs , says it wants to make_sure this product is largely bug-free . The company will soon release hundreds of thousands of beta versions for tests to make_sure there are no surprises . Most testers are satisfied with the new software . Mark Eppley , chief_executive of Travelling Software of Bothell , Wash. , says the company has 10 engineers using Windows 95 on their systems , and they have reported no major problems . Eppley said the new Windows version also has features that make its substantially easier to develop software for . But there are still glitches . One beta tester said his computer would n ' t run the new software and he was forced to erase everything on his computer to remove the program . When he contacted Microsoft about the problem , he said , &quot; They didn ' t want to hear about it. &quot; By next fall , most new personal_computers will be sold with Windows 95 already installed in them . But those sales replace existing Windows sales and won ' t represent huge revenue gains . &quot; The real gold mine is in upgrades , &quot; says Brent Williams , an analyst at the Framingham-based consultant firm IDC Inc. &quot; For Microsoft to get those sales , there has to be no surprises. &quot;</TEXT>
