   <HEADLINE> REALITY COOKING ; TAKE-OUT : THE ULTIMATE REALITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite an onslaught of competition from supermarket delis and swarms of take-out chains , independent carry-out shops -- which led the movement for quick , quality food that could be picked_up on the way home from work -- still thrive . Some of Southern California ' s best take-out comes from the following shops . Each in its own way has a special style that keeps customers loyal . Proprietors tend to be opinionated , down-to-earth andgenerous . * A huge make-believe tree &quot; grows &quot; right out of the roof at Wesley ' s Place , a green market and carry-out food_shop . Deli cases are surrounded by mountains of vegatables and ripe fruit . Here seasonal produce is the main ingredient in a constantly changing selection of dishes . The store ' s slogan is : &quot; You ' d cook like this if you had the time ! &quot; Wesley Bartera ' s food-from-the-garden theme may seem a timely marketing ploy in light of the USDA ' s advice to eat ample fruits and vegetables . But the idea actually evolved from the small 1 # 000-square-foot produce shop Bartera bought_in 1975 . She upgraded the produce quality and selection , which attracted local budding gourmet cooks . Eventually Bartera expanded the business by selling fresh-cut fruit trays , fresh salsas , guacamole and zucchini bread . But , she says , &quot; people kept asking me to do a little of this and that for their parties and the whole_thing just snowballed. &quot; Last October , Bartera moved_into a new La Canada store more_than six times larger than her original shop . Wesley ' s Produce became Wesley ' s Place . Seasonal produce is transformed into American-style dishes with just enough quirky international touches to keep things interesting . Bartera ' s 25 or 30 potato_salad recipes , for example , include blue_cheese potato_salad and German-style potato_salad . Coleslaw is also a standby and there ' s always one coleslaw with a novel twist : California red_cabbage slaw , for instance , has strips of red and yellow pepper , zucchini and zingy lime-cumin vinaigrette . Soups , especially the cold ones , are some of Wesley ' s more delicious concoctions . When peas are in season , the kitchen makes a chilled soup from fresh , slightly sweet_peas , flavored with handfuls of fresh mint and finished with cream . Popular gazpachos include gazpacho verde and white gazpacho with garlic , cucumber and ground_almonds . In late summer , Wesley ' s bakes fruit and berry cobblers and makes big batches of homemade , low-sugar jam . Wesley ' s entree menu lists three different options each week ( you can fax your choices in at ( 818 ) 952-9324 ) . There ' s always a dish called &quot; chef ' s whim chicken breast. &quot; It might be marinated Yucatan-style and grilled or perhaps braised in a Dijon sauce . Other entrees might be pork_loin with green peppercorn sauce , roasted game hen stuffed with wild_rice and apricots , Mexican-style turkey lamb shank and vegetarian lasagna . Bread is baked in-house , but Wesley also carries half_a_dozen varieties of Italian_bread from Pani Pani bakery . Padus , with a rich yeasty flavor is the round loaf made from semolina flour , . filoni and fint ( yes , fint ) , skate board-sized Italian white and whole-wheat loaves , are sliced for sandwiches . Demi-baguettes are made with Kalamata olives or walnuts , wheat and raisins or sun-dried tomatoes . While the counter people pack your order , you can relax with a cappuccino under the faux tree . Wesley ' s Place , 711- H Foothill Blvd. , La Canada , ( 818 ) 790-4622 . Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. , Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. , Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. * Umberto Savone bounds around the long , thin stainless-steel kitchen of his Umberto Food , looking_for ingredients to put_on a pizza . &quot; I call this pizza a la Nonna -- that ' s grandmother ' s pizza , &quot; he says , dangling a slice of grilled zucchini over dough on a wooden paddle . &quot; When I was a kid all my grandmothers would make this for us because it didn ' t cost much . They used_up whatever they had around. &quot; Savone arranges pesto-laced roasted potato slicesand tiny chunks of sausage braised in tomato_sauce , on the dough , then adds assorted grilled vegetables , goat_cheese and low-fat mozzarella . &quot; I ' m still working_on the crust recipe , &quot; he admits . &quot; I called my mother to get her advice. &quot; Even so , the pizza is marvelous and homey . &quot; I learned to cook like this by helping my grandmothers , &quot; Umberto SAYS . &quot; I would hang_around and do odd chores like bringing_in wood for the stove . That way I would get a lot of good things to eat. &quot; Cherubic-looking Savone is most well-known as a beauty-salon magnate . He is Umberto of Beverly Hills . His food venture , he says , is for his beauty customers . &quot; Now they can take_home some wonderful food after being busy all day. &quot; Supervising his 126 beauticians and two salons , Umberto can ' t devote much time to the stove . Never mind . He leaves most of the cooking TO chef Pasquale Giordano and his assistant Roger Berrera . Green_beans with caramelized onions , and whole cloves of roasted garlic may have been inspired by umberto ' s nona , but giordano uses fine French-style green beans.Although grilled baby summer_squashes may be part of a home-cook ' s repertoire , Umberto ' s grandmother probably didn ' t use thumb-sized zucchini and yellow pattypans about the size of a nickel . Thin scallops of skinless chicken_breast , are quickly sauteed and seasoned with balsamic vinegar . one salad combines hearts of palm and fresh roasted baby artichokes with mushrooms and colorful peppers . &quot; We ' re trying to keep the food light , &quot; Giordano says and holds_up a squid and vegetable salad . But there is something for everyone here : Roast chickens with rosemary , or chicken_breasts lightly breaded and cooked milanese ? style . Cheese-stuffed roasted eggplant slices are topped with full-bodied marinara , and cooked-to-order pastas include penne with grilled chicken and sun dried tomatoes in a light_cream sauce . At Umberto Food , pizzas can also be ordered anyway you like them , even the way Umberto ' s Nonna would have made them . Umberto Food , 424 N . Canon Drive , Beverly Hills , ( 310 ) 274- 5653 . Open Tuesday to Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. * Amalfi used to be an antique store on Santa Monica ' s Main_Street until Janine and Rodolfo Giglioni turned it into their Italian gourmet shop about 11 months ago . deli cases and shelves of groceries all lead to the open kitchen where the two work as they talk to customers . With the baby in the next room , the couple work stoves and counters all day . Janine makes fresh mozzarella . Rodolfo prepares his own lean chicken and turkey sausage daily . Week-ends , there ' s seafood sausage , too . Rodolfo grew_up apprenticing in Italian restaurant kitchens ; Janine studied at the restaurant-hotel school of culinary_arts in Perugia . Husband and wife met in Italy and cooked together there for 12 years at Milan ' s famous Gualtiero Marquesi and Marina Due on Elba . This place gets better as you get_to know the food...and the chefs . the giglioni ' s willcook whatever you ' re in the mood to eat . If you need prompting though , there ' s plenty in the display_cases to encourage you . Arancini , golden fried ovals of rice and cheese , are delicious with a side_dish of brocoletti di rape sauteed in garlic . The garlicky bitter greens are also wonderful tossed with cooked pasta . Vegetarian cannelloni , are tender crepes filled with vegetables and ricotta . There ' s a different soup each day , too . &quot; We only use vegetable broth ; meat is too heavy for soup , &quot; Rodolfo says of the white_bean or lentil and vegetable_soups they usually serve . Amalfi ' s sandwiches are wonderfully exotic : Gorgonzola cheese with creamed walnuts and prosciutto cotto come_on crusty Italian rolls or homemade focaccia . Prosciutto gets paired with radicchio and creamy mascarpone.Piadina Romagnola , served only in the wintertime , is a homemade pocket-style bread filled with Amalfi ' s freshly made mozzarella , prosciutto , grilled red_peppers and spinach . Amalfi also turns_out the unusual Neapolitan Easter dessert called pastiera : a sophisticated-slightly sweet , ricotta-based cheese cake studded with chewy cooked wheat_berries . Amalfi , 2400 - D Main St. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 392-7466 . Daily 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. * Homey cooking of a very different sort comes from The Main_Course , a place with food that seems to be straight from Fanny Farmer ' s cook book . Every day , the shop roasts turkeys that go_into sandwiches or become turkey dinners served with mashed potatoes , steamed fresh vegetables , homemade cranberry_sauce and gravy . The carcasses are used for soup and stock for the shop ' s gravy and sauces . Sometimes they will roast a stand of beef rib , or loins of pork or offer such nostalgia-inducing dishes as Irish lamb stew and corned_beef and cabbage . These savory dishes are the doing of Reggie Arjungi , now the owner . The two Canadian sisters who started The Main_Course years ago served the same Mom ' s-home-cooking style . But Arjungi , sensitive to his customers preferences , has brought the food into the ' 90s lightning up many dishes that might otherwise be too rich . Mashed potatoes at The Main_Course have no milk or butter ( or anything else ) . The more expensive Kingston Idaho potatoes he uses have enough flavor on_their_own , Arjungi believes . Gravy and most of the sauces are thoroughly tasty though made without butter or drippings . We don ' t claim this is diet food , says Arjungi , &quot; we ' re just keeping_up with the times. &quot; I recently found_out that The Main_Course ' s frozen dinners have a great following with mothers of teenagers--presumably because they need to have wholesome meals on_hand at a moments notice . Most are $ 4.95 for a single serving that amply serves two ( unless served to male teenagers ) . The selection includes turkey chili , Hungarian chicken goulash and an especially good chicken tarragon . The large chunks of fork-tender , skinless braised chicken in a fat-free , tarragon-infused sauce tastes as flavorful as_many richer versions would . The Main_Course , 10509 W . Pico Blvd . West Los Angeles , ( 310 ) 475-7564 . Open Monday to Saturday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. * In the style of a French traiteur , a term that loosely translates to caterer or gourmet shop owner , Pascal Olhats , chef and owner of Orange County ' s well-loved Pascal country-French restaurant , opened Pascal Epicerie about seven months ago . His admirers had approached him to open other restaurants . But Olhats likes a business he can oversee personally most of the time . So he elected to open next door to his restaurant . From the shop ' s grand new kitchen , Olhats can cater larger parties and with the shop ' s specialites gastronomiques , his patrons may cater their own events with dinner or hors d ' oeuvres . Most foods here have the solid robust flavors of Provence . This is the_French soul food of garlic infused escargots , creamy potatoes au gratin , roasted chickens and tomato tarts . Deeply flavored confit of duck leg comes packed in a seasoned , rendered duck fat that is marvelous for sauteing onions and potatoes to accompany the duck meat . Of the daily changing entrees you may find bouillabaisse , or cassoulet . But every day there will be Pascal ' s signature dish sea_bass with a &quot; crust &quot; of thyme and crumbs resting_on a tomato coulis . For hors d ' oeuvre , Pascal offers his black_olive tepenade ; an eggplant caviar and a marmelade of sweet caramelized onion to serve on croutons . There ' s a small but hard-to-find selection of French cheeses including several sheep ' s milk and goat varieties like brin d ' amour , a goat ' s milk cheese ripened on a bed of herbs . Charcuterie is also made on the premises which is extremely unusual in these days of commercial pate manufacturers . Pascal puts_out about half_a_dozen items including his own rillettes and a duck and pistachio-nut terrine . A case holds picture-perfect tarts , cookies and house-made truffles . Many patrons seem to be friends and long-time customers of Pascal and some avail themselves of the shop ' s wine_cellar where they rent one of the lockers . Says Olhats , &quot; I select my favorite wines from small vintners so they are often a much better value than wines from better-known wineries. &quot; Pascal Epicerie and Wine , 1000 Bristol St . , ( in Plaza Newport at Jamboree ) Newport Beach , ( 714 ) 261-6868 .</TEXT>
