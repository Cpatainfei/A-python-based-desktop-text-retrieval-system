   <HEADLINE> CYBERSPACE COPYRIGHT PROPOSAL DRAWS PRAISE ; TECHNOLOGY : THE ADMINISTRATION ' S DRAFT WOULD EXTEND PROTECTION TO ON-LINE SERVICES AND DIGITAL BROADCASTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Endorsing a first , tentative step toward modernizing the nation ' s intellectual property laws , the entertainment and information industries today welcomed a draft recommendation from the Clinton_Administration on extending copyright law to cover on-line services and other corners of cyberspace . Record companies , film studios and book publishers have been increasingly concerned about illegal copies of musical recordings and texts being exchanged over electronic networks . And the broader question of how to protect intellectual property amid a sea of technology that makes copying easy and cheap has become a critical issue for both creative artists and their corporate masters . The amendments proposed by a Commerce_Department task_force would limit unauthorized copying of software and other intellectual property , making_it clear that existing copyright protections applied to the electronic realm . The task_force also recommended outlawing the manufacture and importation of devices used to crack anti-copying encryption codes . And in a proposal that brought a swift rebuke from the broadcasting industry , it said copyright owners should be given a &quot; performance right , &quot; which would enable musicians and other performers to collect fees for digital broadcasts of their work . Congress has done little with the nation ' s copyright laws in nearly 20 years , but the Administration plans to unveil legislation based on the task_force recommendations later this year , after the Commerce_Department holds a series of public hearings on the piracy problem . The hearings are to be held_in Washington , Chicago and Los Angeles this fall . Copyright laws already make clear that music , writing , software and other forms of creative expression can be legally protected , giving the owner an exclusive permit to reproduce and distribute the work . But when material such_as books and recordings are posted on on-line services such_as Prodigy or CompuServe -- where any computer user can gain access -- the law is murky . Industry groups applauded the Administration ' s proposals but warned against widespread controls on data transmission . &quot; While some fine-tuning of current copyright law may be desirable , overall the Administration has made_it clear that the laws governing the use , redistribution and manipulation of data should not be tampered with , &quot; Kenneth B . Allen , president of the Information Industry Assn. , a Washington trade group , said in a statement . &quot; Without our industry ' s products and services , the information superhighway will be an expressway to nowhere. &quot; The Recording Industry Assn . of America , which represents Sony , PolyGram , MCA and other companies , said extending current copyright laws to cyberspace will prevent digital broadcasting firms from offering performances over cable_television wires without compensating the artists . &quot; The report finally puts intellectual property protection four square &quot; into the Administration ' s blueprint for a National Information Infrastructure , said Hilary Rosen , president of the recording industry group . Industry_analysts have observed Internet users distributing snippets of Aerosmith and Nirvana songs without permission , she said . On-line services have said that responsibility for enforcing copyrights lies_with the owner of a work , not the bulletin_board on which it is posted . Some , like America Online , based in Mclean , Va. , ask subscribers to agree not to redistribute copyrighted material and not to post such work_on public forums , a spokeswoman said . The proposed amendments could eventually force on-line services and computer users to pay fees each time they download or transfer text , graphics or other material . If industry leaders are fearful of unauthorized copying and distribution , they will be less inclined to make their works available , said Bruce A . Lehman , who chaired the Commerce_Department task_force . The proposal to ban anti-encryption equipment is likely to draw opposition from electronics manufacturers , who fought a long battle with the recording industry over new digital taping formats . The equipment vendors eventually agreed to a modest royalty on blank digital tapes and disks , as well as taping equipment . The Home Recording Rights Coalition , an anti-royalty lobbying group led by electronics manufacturers , said in a statement that it is &quot; reserving judgment &quot; on the recommendations and will examine how they might &quot; affect consumer access to and enjoyment of new electronics , information and entertainment products and services. &quot;</TEXT>
