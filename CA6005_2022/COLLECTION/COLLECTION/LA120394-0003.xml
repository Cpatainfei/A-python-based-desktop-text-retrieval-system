   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS RATCHET UP PRESSURE FOR U.N. PULLOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serbs stepped_up the pressure for a U.N. retreat from the Balkan conflict Friday by rocketing the presidency building in Sarajevo while the U.N. mission chief and the commander for Bosnian-based troops were inside . Two Sega missiles fired from Serbian-held territory crashed into the stately red-brick building shortly after U.N. Protection Force chief Yasushi Akashi and British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose had entered for talks with Bosnian government leaders , mission spokeswoman Claire Grimes said . &quot; Akashi and Rose were in the building at the time but well away from the point of impact , &quot; Grimes said of the midday assault . The incident underscored the eroded authority of the U.N. mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina , where Serbian rebels have detained about 400 peacekeepers as human shields against NATO air strikes as they press attacks on U.N.-designated &quot; safe areas. &quot; And it came amid conflicting reports that the U.N. mission had called_off enforcement of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia as part of an effort to find a way to persuade the Serbs to resume negotiations . &quot; As far as the missiles hitting the building , it seems they ( Serbs ) had information . We ' re not saying they were directly targeting Akashi and Rose , but the implication is very strong , &quot; said one shaken U.N. official at mission headquarters here . The official , who requested anonymity , said the U.N. hierarchy is &quot; frustrated as hell , &quot; and that the apparent provocation against two of the top U.N. officials in the Balkans had intensified already widespread talk_about withdrawing the Bosnia-based peacekeepers . In addition to taking peacekeepers captive , gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic have been blocking the movement of supplies to thousands of other encircled U.N. forces , as well as humanitarian aid bound for nearly 2 million Bosnian civilians . Akashi , who was spending the night at Serbian rebel headquarters , was quoted by a Reuters journalist in Pale as announcing that he had secured a promise from Karadzic to release all hostage peacekeepers . However , mission headquarters had not been informed of the reported agreement as of late Friday night , U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said , adding that it would be unlikely any of the captive troops would be released before daybreak . Both Bosnian and Croatian Serbs kept_up their attacks on the Bihac pocket , with small-arms fighting having moved &quot; very , very close &quot; to the city ' s hospital , Grimes said . The U.N. mission has been engaged in a hostile standoff with the heavily armed Serbs since a series of ineffectual NATO air strikes prompted the rebels to grab peacekeepers as &quot; insurance &quot; against further shows of force to deter attacks on Bihac and other havens . In an apparent attempt to wheedle the defiant Serbs off the battlefields and back to negotiations , a U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo announced that the mission had called_off NATO enforcement of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone imposed over Bosnia . Timothy Hewlett , the U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo , told journalists that the flyovers had been stopped for &quot; a cooling-off period , &quot; to create a better atmosphere for peace talks in hopes the Serbs would take_part . NATO officials hotly denied that they had ceased their air patrols , but U.N. spokesmen at the headquarters here and in Sarajevo indicated that the enforcement had at least been reduced . &quot; If you were in Sarajevo , you couldn ' t help but notice that there hasn ' t been a single overflight for several days , &quot; one U.N. official here said , drawing a distinction between &quot; our formal position and reality. &quot; In Washington , a senior military official flatly denied that NATO had cut_back its enforcement flights , but he conceded that allied warplanes were now flying &quot; smarter &quot; -- that is , using electronic_jamming and flying at higher altitudes -- to guard against Serbian missiles . Despite the apparent U.N. attempt to ease NATO pressure on the Serbs and a conciliatory visit by Rose and Akashi to rebel headquarters in Pale , 10 miles east of Sarajevo , Bosnian Serb offensives and harassment of peacekeepers continued . U.N. officials reported that Karadzic was no longer even replying to their daily requests to move fuel , food and other supplies to any of the 24 # 000 peacekeepers in Bosnia . At the United Nations late Friday , Russia vetoed a Security_Council resolution aimed at stopping the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro from sending fuel supplies that reportedly are powering the Serbs ' offensive in northern Bosnia . It was the first council veto in a year and a half , and the first on the Bosnian war . Russia , a traditional Serbian ally , said it vetoed the resolution because it would unfairly tighten sanctions against Serbia . Tensions between rebel Serbs and Croats in this country have escalated in recent days , with artillery exchanges and small-arms fire reported along a 100-mile arc of their front_line . The Croatian government and leaders of the Serbian rebel faction occupying one-third of Croatia signed a token agreement to restore some road and utility links , as well as an oil_pipeline to the Adriatic_Sea . But even the brokers of the deal on mutually advantageous economic cooperation conceded that prospects for a breakthrough toward resolution of the overall Serb-Croat conflict were grim . Croatian army_units were reported to be firing across a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone near the Adriatic coast , and the signatory for the Serbian rebel side , Borislav Mikulic , immediately declared that the utility restoration should not be seen as rebel acceptance of rule by Croatia . &quot; The Krajina will never be part of Croatia , &quot; Mikulic , the rebels ' self-styled prime_minister , told journalists after signing the economic cooperation pact on behalf of those living_in the Croatian territory Serbian occupiers call the independent Republic of Serbian Krajina . Of greatest concern to the U.N. mission and the international community is the Krajina Serbs ' use of the occupied territory to stage attacks across an international border into the Bihac pocket . Peter Galbraith , the U.S. ambassador to Croatia , and his mediation partner , Russian Ambassador Leonid V . Kerestidyants , warned Mikulic against continued involvement of Krajina Serbs in the assault on Bihac , one of six U.N.-designated &quot; safe havens &quot; in Bosnia . &quot; This risks a wider war that could have terrible consequences for them , &quot; Galbraith said . Asked about the Sarajevo report that NATO pilots had been asked to &quot; stand down &quot; in &quot; no-fly &quot; enforcement over Bosnia , Galbraith insisted that NATO planes were still active , but he conceded that the alliance pilots had to &quot; change some patterns because of the ( surface-to-air_missile ) threat. &quot; Karadzic gunmen have positioned surface-to-air batteries around Bihac and Sarajevo airport to intimidate NATO fliers , who are prohibited from bombing the missile sites even though the missiles could be used to shoot them down . U.N. officials fear that such action would invite retaliation against the hostage peacekeepers . The senior military official did not say where the Serbian nationalists had obtained the missiles or why NATO forces -- which previously had enjoyed unchallenged air superiority over Bosnia and authority to fire at missile-radar installations -- had allowed the rebels to put them in place . Bosnian Serb rebels on Friday morning released 70 of the nearly 500 U.N. troops they had grabbed as shields against further NATO air strikes . But about 400 remained captives , and thousands of others are deployed to Serb-encircled enclaves , such_as Sarajevo , where they could easily be seized by the rebels .
