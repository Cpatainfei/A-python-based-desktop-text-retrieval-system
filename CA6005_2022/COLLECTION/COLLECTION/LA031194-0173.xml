   <HEADLINE> BLACK HOMELAND REGIME NEAR COLLAPSE ; SOUTH_AFRICA : LEADER OF BOPHUTHATSWANA FLEES AFTER FOURTH DAY OF VIOLENCE . PROTESTERS CELEBRATE BY LOOTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bizarre black homeland government of Bophuthatswana , one of the strangest creations of apartheid , appeared close to collapse Thursday night after four days of raucous strikes , running street battles and scattered gunfire in the tiny capital . Thousands of chanting , cheering protesters celebrated by looting shops and burning and stoning vehicles in the dusty streets of Mmabatho after local radio reported that the autocratic president , Lucas Mangope , had fled by helicopter . His whereabouts could not be confirmed . But Mangope clearly had lost_control , since his once-feared police and military_forces were crumbling in the face of demonstrators ' demands that the nominally independent homeland be reincorporated into South_Africa and its voters be allowed to take_part in the country ' s first free , all-race elections next month . Mmabatho was_quiet by midnight , residents said , with police manning roadblocks around government buildings and hotels . But early today , South_African army troops took_up positions at the South_African Embassy in Mmabatho . At the same time , armed white extremists streamed into Bophuthatswana . There were no immediate reports of clashes . Foreign Minister Roelof F . ( Pik ) Botha said the troops had been sent_in because of unrest Thursday and the deployment of white rightists . Botha , in a statement released early today , said their main mission was to protect embassy staff and their families but that they also were_on hand &quot; to maintain law and order and to protect South_African citizens and their interests should the situation deteriorate. &quot; Almost everyone in Mangope ' s civil_service , from firefighters to teachers , honored a general strike Thursday to protest his repressive policies . Shops were shuttered , offices closed . And senior members of his handpicked administration had deserted the smoke-filled , embattled capital . By late afternoon , hundreds of local troops and police had joined the uprising , allowing students to climb atop armored military_vehicles and defiantly wave flags in support of Nelson Mandela ' s African National Congress . Two people , including a policeman , were reported killed and more_than 70 injured in clashes this week . At least 37 were wounded Wednesday by police firing buckshot and tear_gas in tense running battles through the streets . International observer missions , who are flooding into South_Africa for the elections , issued an appeal for peace . &quot; We deplore the use of force and call_on all concerned , and particularly the security_forces of Bophuthatswana , to prevent further casualties and loss of life , &quot; said the statement , issued by the U.N. , Organization of African Unity , European Union and Commonwealth observer missions . Mangope has refused to take_part in South_Africa ' s historic elections next month . More important , he announced that he would not let other political_parties campaign in his territory nor permit polls to open for the estimated 1.4 million voters in his nominal control . Mangope , 69 , insists his country is free and independent . But South_Africa is the only nation to recognize it . He has ruled with near-dictatorial powers since the engineers of apartheid created Bop , as it is called , and nine other homelands and territories in the 1970s as a way of separating the races . Bop became the most successful of the homelands , drawing rich revenues from platinum mines and gambling_casinos at Sun City . All the homelands are to be abolished after the April 26-28 election and reincorporated into South_Africa , according to the interim constitution .</TEXT>
