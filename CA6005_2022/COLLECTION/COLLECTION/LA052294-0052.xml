   <HEADLINE> RECORD RACK : IN BRIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * * * Milla , &quot; The Divine Comedy , &quot; SBK / ERG . Forget that Russian-born Milla Jovovich is a supermodel-actress.Forget that she ' s just 18 years old . Forget the pretentious album title . This debut would be a solid effort even for a seasoned veteran . Milla ' s strong writing and mature vocals ( both somewhat in the Kate Bush mode ) make one hope that this is not just a dilettantish side trip but the start of a full music career . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . STEVE HOCHMAN</TEXT>
