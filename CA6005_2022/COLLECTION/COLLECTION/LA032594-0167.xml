   <HEADLINE> AFTERMATH OF AN ASSASSINATION ; COLOSIO SLAYING CASTS A SHADOW ; LATIN_AMERICA : MURDER OF LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC FUTURE OF MEXICO . STILL , MANY U.S. EXECUTIVES REMAIN CONFIDENT IN NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assassination of leading Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio raises questions about the country ' s economic future and threatens to stem the flow of new investment needed to continue Mexico ' s economic reforms , at least in the short term . But executives of U.S. businesses that have already invested heavily in Mexico -- as well as officials of the Clinton_Administration , which has staked considerable prestige on the success of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement -- expressed confidence in the underlying strength of Mexico ' s economy . Uncertainty prevailed in the wake of the shooting , which came_on the heels of a January uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the kidnaping of a prominent Mexican banker . Colosio , the handpicked successor to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , was an important symbol of continuity for foreign investors . Now , the main question is , who will replace Colosio : someone likely to continue the economic_policies of Salinas , or a more populist candidate who would be less amenable to foreigners ? The other key question : Was the shooting the random act of a madman or the latest act in a systematic rebellion against Mexico ' s status_quo ? The latter raises the specter of political upheaval , which would tend to scare_away foreign capital . Significant investments will probably be delayed until the answers are known , analysts said . And that could be critical to a nation that has staked its economic future on luring foreign investment . Colosio ' s assassination will &quot; slow_down economic_growth and investments and cause people to stand_back and take a deep breath before coming_down , &quot; said Tony Ramirez , vice_president of Made in Mexico , a Chula Vista-based consultant . &quot; But it won ' t stop U.S. investment . There is too_much to gain. &quot; Several U.S. firms -- from car_makers to banks to toy companies to tour operators -- said they would not be deterred from expanding their business in Mexico , which remains a promising market , particularly under NAFTA . * Luis Maizel , a fund manager and president of LM Capital Management in La Jolla , said he was besieged with phone_calls Thursday from worried investors in Mexico -- as well as from pension_fund managers wondering if this would be a good time to buy Mexican stocks . The Mexican government &quot; will have to do a lot of bridge repairing_to get this off the minds of investors , &quot; Maizel said . Still , among institutional investors attending a Mexico_City conference Thursday , &quot; the feeling was clearly , ( the shooting ) was an aberration from Mexican history . . . and compared with other countries around the world , it is still a stable environment , &quot; said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda , a UCLA urban_planning professor who addressed the gathering . Word of the assassination sent shock_waves through many of the 2 # 200 Mexican maquiladoras -- foreign-owned border factories , the vast majority of which are American -- as well as other American-owned businesses . Robert S . Jezak , vice_president and general_manager of Mattel toy maker ' s giant Tijuana maquiladora , said the killing casts a pall over the future of his company ' s operations in Mexico as well as those of every_other foreign company . &quot; We feel let_down and ashamed because we saw a bright future with NAFTA , and now we see that the internal struggles are beginning to take precedence over the economic_growth of the country , &quot; said Jezak , whose 2 # 000 employees make his factory one of the largest foreign-owned plants in Tijuana . &quot; If it ' s the work of one assassin with a vengeance , then things will settle_down . But if it ' s a greater story , then people will stay nervous and ( the assassination ) will begin to have an impact on their lives as well as livelihoods because as the political scene changes in Mexico , the economic scene has always changed with it. &quot; Still , the killing is not likely to cause any company to close_up shop and head back across the border immediately , officials said . U.S. exports to Mexico were $ 41.6 billion in 1993 , the Commerce_Department reported . &quot; It ' s a sad turn of events , but for us , at the moment we don ' t see any change in our business , &quot; said Donald O ' Neal , spokesman for Hughes Space &amp; Communications , a Hughes Aircraft subsidiary that has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the Mexican communications satellite business in the last decade . Major American banks planning to open subsidiaries south of the border generally said the assassination would not affect their plans . &quot; It ' s seen as a political event , not an economic one , &quot; said a spokesman for Chase Manhattan Corp . &quot; I don ' t think our extending credit to Mexico will be affected by this. &quot; Wednesday ' s assassination throws into question the timing of an upgrade to Mexico ' s credit rating , crucial to wooing pension_funds and other large foreign investment . But the international credit rating agencies were inclined to take a long view of Mexico ' s potential . Moody ' s and Duff &amp; Phelps were not disturbing their speculative credit ratings for Mexico ' s bonds ; they were impressed by what they and international economists called Mexico ' s &quot; institutions. &quot; Moody ' s rates Mexico ' s debt securities as Ba2 and Duff &amp; Phelps gives Mexico a BBB rating . &quot; While Duff &amp; Phelps will continue to monitor events closely , Mexico has sufficient international reserves and other tools to weather this shock and keep the long-term economic strategy in place , &quot; said David Roberts , head of international ratings for Duff &amp; Phelps . * Kristin Lindow of Moody ' s said that Mexico ' s &quot; weak economy and overvalued peso &quot; would have to be changed in the aftermath of the latest violence . Like many others she saw the government taking action to boost economic activity , even if this were to cause the peso to decline in the coming days . To help Mexico weather any immediate financial market jitters from the assassination , the United States on Thursday set_up a $ 6-billion credit_line , a so-called swap facility . * MAIN STORY : A1</TEXT>
