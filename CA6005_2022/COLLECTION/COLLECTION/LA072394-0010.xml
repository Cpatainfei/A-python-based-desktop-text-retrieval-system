   <HEADLINE> BRAIN SIZE LINKED TO RISK OF DEMENTIA , STUDY FINDS ; HEALTH : THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CAUSES OF ALZHEIMER ' S DISEASE MAY OCCUR IN INFANCY , NOT IN OLD_AGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People with below-average head size have as much as 18 times the normal risk of developing dementia caused by Alzheimer ' s and other diseases , Washington state researchers have found . The findings suggest that such individuals do not have enough brain_cells in reserve to offset the loss of cells caused by aging and neurological_diseases , said epidemiologist Amy B . Graves of Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories in Seattle . When such losses do occur , the brains of people with smaller than average heads are more likely to contain fewer cells than are necessary for coherent thought . The new results suggest that the most important causes of Alzheimer ' s may_not occur late in life , as most scientists now believe , but at the very earliest stages of development , a conclusion that could have profound implications for efforts to prevent such disorders . Graves ' findings are based on a study of 1 # 458 Japanese Americans that is to be presented at the upcoming Fourth International Conference on Alzheimer ' s Disease and Related Disorders . The results are supported by at least two other studies previously published or now in press . Although small head size can be genetic in origin , the most common causes are the mother ' s smoking and drug use during pregnancy and nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy and in the baby ' s first two years of life , the periods when brain_cells are actively growing . &quot; If we are going_to invest money in preventing Alzheimer ' s disease , we may want to invest it not among the elderly but at the other end of the age spectrum , &quot; said Dr. James A . Mortimer of the Veterans Affairs Medical_Center in Minneapolis . &quot; It will be a very long-term investment , but it may prove to be the only effective way to do it. &quot; Graves ' study &quot; does raise very interesting questions about the link between brain size and dementia , &quot; said Dr. Peter Schofield of Columbia University . It is impressive because of the large_number of people studied , he noted , but still more studies are necessary to confirm the results . Dementia is a jumbling of thought processes that leaves the victim forgetful and confused , a condition that is often called senility . Although it has a variety of causes , the two most common are strokes and Alzheimer ' s disease . Previous work has shown that key areas of the human brain must have a minimum number of cells , called the threshold , to prevent dementia , Graves said . An average-size brain can afford to lose up_to 70 % of the cells it had during childhood in regions of the brain that control thought processes , such_as the hippocampus . After the first two or three years of life , no new brain_cells are formed and those present die_off at a more or less constant rate , unless the rate is accelerated by disease or injury . &quot; If everybody lived long enough , everyone would become demented , &quot; Graves said , but for many that might mean living to 120 . By that reasoning , the more brain_cells a person has to begin with , the longer it will take_for the number of cells to fall below the threshold . Head size is generally considered to be a rough indicator of brain size . The Battelle research was carried_out as part of an international study to compare the incidence of dementia , including Alzheimer ' s , in Japanese Americans in Seattle and Honolulu and Japanese in Hiroshima , Japan . The goal is to help determine the relative influence of genetics and environment in strokes and Alzheimer ' s disease . In the study , Graves and her colleagues measured the head circumference of 1 # 458 people over the age of 65 and correlated it with their performance on a widely used diagnostic test for dementia . Those with the smallest circumference , about 21 inches or less , were 18 times as likely to be demented as those with a circumference of 23 inches or greater . In general , women ' s heads are smaller , Mortimer said , but there is evidence that their brain_cells may be packed more densely , which would offset the size difference . Graves ' finding is buttressed by related studies . In a study of nursing_home residents , Dr. Robert Katzman of UC San Diego first determined who was demented and then autopsied the brains after death . He found that people with dementia were most likely to have the smallest brains . In an as-yet-unpublished study , Schofield of Columbia has correlated the age of onset of Alzheimer ' s disease in 28 patients with the size of their brains as determined by a CAT scan . He found that the larger the brain size , the older the patient was at diagnosis . He concluded that those with the largest brains could afford to lose more brain_cells before dementia occurred . The researchers cautioned that not everyone with a small head develops dementia . &quot; The density of brain_cells could be just as important as the overall size of the brain , &quot; Mortimer said . Studies are under way now to determine if that is the case , he added .</TEXT>
