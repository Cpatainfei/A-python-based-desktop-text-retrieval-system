   <TEXT> In late July , two thieves hid in Frankfurt ' s Schirn Kunsthalle until the gallery ' s closing time , then overpowered the sole security_guard before he could activate the night alarm_system . They handcuffed and gagged him , stuck him in an anteroom and patiently removed three paintings from the walls . Then they carried their booty out the back_door to a waiting car . The haul : two magnificent oils by English Romantic painter J.M.W. Turner and a landscape by the German master Caspar David Friedrich . The three paintings were insured for $ 45 million . There has been no word from the thieves . A few hours after the Frankfurt theft , someone broke_through the main door of the Rembrandt House Museum outside Amsterdam and made off with two paintings by Rembrandt ' s tutor , Pieter Lastman . Again , no word from the culprits . In February , Norway ' s most famous painting , &quot; The Scream &quot; by Edvard Munch , was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo . This time the thieves made contact , asking_for more_than $ 1 million in ransom for the painting , which was valued at $ 10.5 million . Police cracked the case , recovering the painting before the money was paid . Two men were arrested . Last fall , in November , paintings by Picasso and Braque , valued at $ 60 million , were taken from Stockholm ' s Modern Museum . The paintings have been recovered and two men arrested . In the last five years , 38 works by master painters have been stolen from French museums . Last month , a pastel portrait by the 17th-Century painter Robert Nanteuil was stolen from the Louvre , between rounds of the guards . In Budapest last December , about 200 art objects worth $ 85 million were stolen from the main synagogue , repository of the largest Jewish collection in Europe . Art theft , always an intriguing crime because of the familiarity and history of many of the pieces , is becoming rampant . Police in Europe now list art and antique thefts as the third most profitable criminal activity -- after drug smuggling and the illegal arms trade . &quot; There ' s no question , art thefts are very much on the increase , involving millions and millions of dollars , &quot; said Detective Inspector Jill McTigue of Scotland_Yard ' s crack art and antiques squad . &quot; Staggering , &quot; agreed London insurance adjuster Mark Dalrymple . The Turners stolen in Frankfurt -- &quot; Shade and Darkness &quot; and &quot; Light and Color &quot; -- were painted in 1843 and , said Nicholas Serota , director of the Tate Gallery in London , which had loaned them to the Schirn , &quot; are masterpieces of European Romanticism . Their theft represents a major loss for the Tate Gallery and for European painting. &quot; The Friedrich , &quot; Wafting Mist , &quot; was_on loan to the Schirn from a museum in Hamburg . Between 1991 and early 1994 in Italy alone , an estimated $ 500 million in artworks were stolen , with thefts doubling to reach about 2 # 000 instances . Said Jean-Michel Mimerand , director of the Office for Repression of Art Thefts in Paris : &quot; France and Italy , closely followed by Spain , are the most pillaged countries . The criminal networks are_well organized to get the merchandise out_to transit countries very quickly. &quot; In St . Petersburg , sitting in his office in the Federal Counterintelligence Service , Nikolai Musinsky spread photos of stolen objects on his desk and said : &quot; These are almost all Faberge works . Weapons and drugs smuggling are dangerous , but in a way the theft and shipping abroad of cultural treasures is far worse . Who can say what loss the government takes if , say , someone steals a Titian from our Hermitage Museum ? &quot; The Russian National Library is still trying to figure_out what ' s left of one of the world ' s greatest collections of ancient Jewish documents . At last count , 38 were missing . Librarians believe they were stolen over a period of years and have been offered at private auctions in Jerusalem and New York . Russia is an art thief ' s dream . Museums are packed with works -- some commissioned by the czars , others confiscated by the Communist regimes -- and then there are the Russian Orthodox Church ' s riches , most of which are unprotected by sophisticated security_systems . One effect of the crime spree is a growing reluctance among museum directors to let treasures leave the building . &quot; I hope thefts won ' t mean a major clampdown on lending paintings , &quot; said David Brown , curator of the Turner collection at the Tate . &quot; We ' re borrowers as well as lenders. &quot; Sometimes thefts show ingenious planning and inside knowledge , as in the Frankfurt heist ; sometimes , as in a case at the Birmingham Museum &amp; Art_Gallery in Britain last December , a theft is a simple rip-off . The Birmingham thief lifted_off the wall a small painting by 15th-Century Flemish painter Petrus Christus , &quot; The Man of Sorrows , &quot; and stuck it in his pocket . Five months later , London detectives recovered it from an art_dealer in Zurich . Why the upsurge in art thefts ? &quot; Partly , it ' s the publicity given these days to works_of_art , &quot; Detective Inspector McTigue said . &quot; Everyone realizes the value of art . Further , a criminal who robs a bank risks getting shot by police , and if caught faces a very long prison sentence for a crime with violence . &quot; A robber taking things from an art_gallery or country mansion does not run the same risks . If he is caught , we still have to prove where the property comes from . Our biggest problem is finding where artistic loot is stolen from. &quot; London ' s arts and antiques squad is recognized as an authority in the field , partly because an estimated 60 % of stolen paintings wind_up in the_British capital . McTigue and others point_out that fine_art , particularly paintings , has become a form of international currency , and as such can serve as coin for big drug deals . &quot; Art has become a favorite method of laundering money , &quot; said Philip Saunders , managing director of the art magazine Trace . &quot; Let ' s say you have a lot of cash from a drug deal . Cash deposits of a certain amount in banks are monitored by police . But you could go_into an auction_house and buy a painting for hundreds of thousands of dollars , no questions asked . &quot; You then take the painting out of the country and sell it to a dealer in Amsterdam , Zurich or Los Angeles . You may lose a little on the transaction , but now the money is clean . In the same way , you can pick lesser-known works to steal and pay_for them with dirty money and sell them for clean money. &quot; The cleverest thieves target paintings below world-class levels because they are not as familiar and can be taken_to other countries and sold as &quot; school of &quot; works -- paintings in the manner of a master -- at reduced prices but for cash . Some thieves steal paintings for the reward invariably offered by insurance_companies , a delicate matter because while it is illegal to deal with criminals , the insurance_companies naturally want the works back -- as do owners . Thus thieves might arrange to give &quot; information &quot; -- and collect the reward -- for paintings they stole . More puzzling is the rationale for stealing paintings such_as the Turners or the Munch , so well known that they would be recognized by any dealer or buyer . Often , thieves plan to ransom back the works to the museum from which they were taken -- or to the insurance_companies that otherwise would have to pay_off millions of dollars . &quot; The problem is that the whole process is going_to turn_into a form of terrorism , cultural terrorism , &quot; said Eric Shanes , head of London ' s Turner Society . &quot; Art theft could become a major form of kidnaping , art-naping. &quot; Art thefts , of course , have occurred since the first art objects were made , and there are differences over what constitutes art theft . Archeologists have long stripped ancient tombs of their artifacts . The Elgin Marbles were taken by Lord Elgin , the_British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire , from the Parthenon in Athens in the early 19th Century . He said he took them for safekeeping during hostilities . But the sculptures still reside in the_British Museum , though Greece insists they were illegally removed . And the audacity of thieves knows few bounds . In 1911 , the world ' s most famous painting , the &quot; Mona Lisa &quot; by Leonardo da Vinci , was stolen from the Louvre in Paris by an Italian workman . He returned it two years later . During World_War_II , Adolf Hitler and other top Nazis looted treasures in occupied Europe . Saddam Hussein ' s Iraqi forces plundered Kuwait ' s national museum , which housed some of the world ' s finest Islamic art . As of now , only about 15 % of stolen art is recovered . What can be done ? First comes increased security inside museums and other collections , but this is expensive . Japan , where thefts were frequent after World_War_II , has tightened security_systems and has significantly reduced thefts . Increasingly , authorities are urging collectors to catalogue and photograph their works , with detailed descriptions that can be traced . The wealth and expertise of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles are now being brought_to_bear with the Getty Art History Information Program , which seeks to cut_down the illicit trade_in art and the looting of archeological sites by accurately describing and depicting the objects themselves . Yet great art remains irresistible . The mystery surrounding major thefts invokes the vision of the rich collector , who orders paintings stolen for his own private viewing . Frankfurt police_chief Karl-Heinz Gemmer said the works stolen from the Schirn were too well known to be sold in the art market . Perhaps , he suggests , they were ordered by an obsessive collector who wanted &quot; to enjoy them under cover of night. &quot; Contributing to this article were Scott Kraft and Christine Black , Paris ; Matt Bivens , St .
