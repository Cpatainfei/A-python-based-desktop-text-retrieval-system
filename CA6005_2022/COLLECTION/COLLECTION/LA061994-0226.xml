   <HEADLINE> REPAIR OR REVOLT ; A JOURNEY THROUGH ECONOMIC TIME : A FIRSTHAND VIEW , BY JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH ( HOUGHTON MIFFLIN : $ 24.95 ; 255 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Somehow I feel I ' m being conned when I read old_men who , looking_back over history , give a cheerful appraisal . I trust the cynics . And so , up_to a point , I trust John Kenneth Galbraith , who in this account of what he &quot; saw or learned of the central core of economic life &quot; during his 65 years , sets the tone of the book with this observation : &quot; Ignorance , stupidity , in great affairs of state is not something that is commonly cited . A certain political and historical correctness requires us to assign some measure of purpose , of rationality , even where , all too obviously , it does not exist. &quot; Later he writes_of &quot; the primal role of stupidity in shaping the course of history. &quot; Ignorance and stupidity are often encountered in &quot; A Journey Through Economic Time , &quot; and not least among some of Galbraith ' s fellow economists , particularly those who believe_in the &quot; classical &quot; boom-bust , government-hands-off , competition uber-alles kind of capitalism and who seek to balance the budget by ignoring human misery . By Galbraith ' s reckoning , these pious bunglers misinterpreted the cause and importance of the 1929 stock_market crash ; ruined the first blip of economic recovery during the Great Depression of the 1930s ; assumed the United States would sink back into a depression after World_War_II ; and gave all recent presidents extremely inhumane advice on how to handle the economy . Perhaps the biggest ongoing mistake of that crowd is its faith in the ability of the economy always to bounce_back -- that after every bust there will be another boom . Galbraith argues , to the contrary , that high unemployment and economic stagnation can reach an equilibrium and just hang there . Such an equilibrium was reached in the 1930s , and it took a war to break it . He believes that such an equilibrium could be developing again . So just where , as an economist , does Galbraith stand ? If I read him correctly -- and I sometimes doubt I can read any economist correctly , even this one who claims &quot; there is no economic_process or problem that cannot be put_in plain language &quot; -- Galbraith ' s philosophy is about 80 % John Maynard Keynes ( from whom he borrowed the just-mentioned equilibrium theory ) , 10 % Karl Marx and 10 % ad_hoc . Galbraith was one of the many bright young guys who swarmed into the New Deal bureaucracy . Some , not many , were Communists . He recalls them with something better than tolerance , and why not ? In his opinion , &quot; no one of any sensitivity could look_on capitalism in those years ( of depression in the 1930s ) and think it was a success . There was , accordingly , a choice between repair and revolt. &quot; He was among the influential , and ultimately dominant , clique who chose Keynesian repair . The British eccentric had only recently rocked the world ' s economics establishment with his argument that the path to recovery from depression was for governments to stop worrying about deficits and spend , spend , spend their way_out of the_pits . Galbraith writes , with what I imagine is a pleased grin , that to classical economists this proposal seemed almost as subversive and certainly as dangerous as communism , and yet every President since then has been forced to follow Keynes ' piping even while some of them chant the ritualistic mantra of the balanced_budget . In the United States , Marx ' s communist doctrines have been used mainly as a bugaboo to rationalize monstrous military budgets during the Cold_War . At the same time , Galbraith notes , our chief economic competitors , Japan and Germany , were studying Marx ' s theories seriously and often with good results , particularly in the way they made their governments serve as a kind of executive committee for their capitalist class . Most liberals in this country find such close cooperation between government and the captains of industry to be dangerously undemocratic , just as they consider it a prime duty of government to use antitrust_laws to break_up anything that looks even suspiciously like a cartel . Not Galbraith . This lifelong liberal believes cartels can be useful , even necessary , in global competition , and he thinks the antitrust hang-up is typical of the &quot; devoid liberal mind. &quot; Clearly , Galbraith is not just another economist . This transplanted Canadian Scot is a man of many hats and moods . While he is_best known as a practitioner and professor of the dismal science of economics , he has also been a journalist ( Fortune magazine ) ; an official appraiser of the results ( very disappointing ) of strategic bombing ; a speech writer ( for , among others , presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson ) ; a high-level bureaucrat , and an adviser ( often as dissenter ) and trouble-shooter for various Presidents . This is his 30th book . He has ranged over such varied topics as art , anthropology , social criticism , travel and , of course , money . One just naturally roots for an intellectual adventurer of Galbraith ' s sort , but I don ' t think &quot; A Journey &quot; will add much gloss to his reputation . The journey is so swift as_to allow us only fleeting , imperfect glimpses of history ' s landscape . The book is_full of hefty judgments and generalities that make you curse Galbraith ' s belief that &quot; detail can disguise the hard and essential core . It can also discourage as well as distract the reader. &quot; Nowhere is the lack of details more irritating than in what otherwise are the liveliest parts of &quot; A Journey , &quot; his discussion of the two world_wars . This is particularly true of World_War I -- the Great War , as he prefers to call it , which wiped_out a generation of young_men and ( the good results ) &quot; shattered a political structure that had been dominant in Europe for centuries. &quot; In those days , the fate of nations was still largely determined by the landed aristocracy . Bloodlines meant everything . It was , he writes , &quot; a nearly perfect design for ensuring that both government and the armed forces would be in the hands of leaders of minimal competence. &quot; Galbraith despises these dimwitted aristocrats who still believed that wars were to be fought for land and who looked_upon their soldiers as little more_than livestock and suitable for slaughter . But without supporting details , his insults let them off_the_hook . In this way he treats Winston Churchill , for example , with surprising kindness -- surprising , that is , because Churchill was a prime example of the blunderers who were elevated to power only by right of birth . As First Lord of the Admiralty , he was &quot; the architect of the Dardanelles_campaign , the most luminous catastrophe of the war. &quot; that ' s all Galbraith says , forcing readers to go_to other books if they want to learn that this dreadful failure cost the Allies 250 # 000 casualties and indirectly triggered the Russian_Revolution . For these lightweight memoirs , Galbraith may feel it is sufficient to call Gen . Douglas Haig &quot; mentally immobile. &quot; But that insult is hardly enough to convey the mentality of this general who ( as other , more serious , historians will tell you ) planned the battle_of_the_Somme with such incredible stupidity as_to cause 60 # 000 Allied casualties on the very first day . Galbraith chides his fellow economists for their priorities : paying painful attention to &quot; a minor change in interest_rates or the public deficit &quot; while ignoring &quot; urban and rural poverty. &quot; Well said . But sometimes the reader may feel that Galbraith ' s devotion to one or another of his theories similarly blinds him to more important moral complexities . For example , because he believes that a fallen enemy should be allowed to rise again as swiftly as possible , he thinks the Versailles Treaty ending World_War I treated Germany much too harshly ( &quot; insanity , &quot; he calls it ) by demanding monetary reparations that the crushed nation could not possibly pay . In fact , as he admits , Germany had fully recovered from its depression by 1936 -- long before we recovered from ours . Hitler had achieved full_employment and a booming economy through the sort of make-work programs and wage-and-price controls that Galbraith admires , so he has only good things to say about this &quot; clearest case of action by the state to promote economic recovery. &quot; What Galbraith does not tell his readers is that the &quot; insanely &quot; harsh Versailles Treaty was not enforced at all on its most important point : prohibiting the rebuilding of Germany ' s armed forces . At the center of the economic boom that Galbraith admires were such industrial giants as I . G . Farben , which produced much of the material Hitler needed to assault the world . Galbraith boasts of having written the speech given by Secretary_of_State James F . Byrnes in Stuttgart in 1946 , just a little more_than a year after the end of World_War_II , returning management of their economic life to the Germans . He does not mention that within five years Nazi industrialists like Alfred Krupp , who had starved and worked thousands of slave laborers to death , were out of prison and back in business in a big way . He is proud_of his part in trying to protect Germany and Japan from a new reparations program -- this time they were to repay the victors with such things as coal and industrial machinery , not money . He feared this would have &quot; demoralizing &quot; effects . He wrings his hands in pity for Germans who watched Soviet soldiers dismantle and carry_away factories &quot; they depended_on for their livelihood. &quot; He expresses no sympathy for the dismantlers , who were from the nation that had suffered the most from the war -- an estimated 20 million dead . He does not mention that in those areas of the Soviet_Union occupied by the Germans , two-thirds of the homes and factories had been destroyed . What else is here ? Well , Galbraith sees hope in the peacemaking qualities of multinational corporations but he says nothing about their eagerness to do business with human-rights violators , like China . He takes a dim view of using economic sanctions to make nations behave . He is not impressed by the self-serving motivations and clumsy methods of the major nations in freeing their colonies since World_War_II . He belittles the various foreign_aid programs . He seems to have little faith that the &quot; comfortably endowed &quot; will ever cough_up enough in taxes to properly house and train the poor . He favors U.N. intervention all_over the place because &quot; no country has the right to destroy its own people. &quot; As I neared the end of this book -- approached the mountaintop , you might say -- I kept hoping that this aged economics guru would give us some special insight , perhaps a summation of his philosophy , something at least as_good_as Kinky Friedman ' s motto : &quot; When the horse dies , get off. &quot; But what we get_at the end is closer to writer Edward Abbey ' s remark : &quot; What is the truth ? I don ' t know , and I ' m sorry I brought it up. &quot; Galbraith ' s valedictory is to warn us that the social and political conflicts of the future will be between 1 ) the haves and the have-nots , and 2 ) the strong nationalists and those who want to work for a community of nations . Yes , yes , we read the dailies , so that prediction hardly breaks new ground . What we want to know , Master G , is how to cope_with those problems . His reply as the clouds close_in around him : &quot; No one can say how these matters will be resolved . . . . For the present , one must be content with identifying the two conflicts that will shape our lives in all_the years to come. &quot; Thanks a lot .</TEXT>
