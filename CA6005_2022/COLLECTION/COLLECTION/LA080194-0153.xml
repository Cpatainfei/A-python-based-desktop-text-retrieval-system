   <HEADLINE> LEGAL FALLOUT ; JUDGE REJECTS CLAIM THAT NEVADA TEST SITE RADIATION CAUSED WORKER ILLNESSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alma Mosley sits alone in her cluttered house and thinks_about justice . Fallen behind a chest of drawers , unreachable , is a framed certificate for work well done , illustrated with a mushroom_cloud and inscribed with her husband ' s name : Hugh Mosley . He has been dead since 1978 , lost to colon_cancer -- a victim , she says , of the Nevada Test Site , where he labored for 13 years at the height of the nation ' s nuclear_weapons testing program . But a federal judge here has disagreed , ruling there was not enough evidence to conclude that radiation caused the illnesses of Hugh Mosley and five other men who worked_at the site in the harsh Nevada desert long ago . The judge said that for some of the men , lifestyles -- diet or cigarettes or alcohol -- may have been to blame . &quot; My husband was a clean man , &quot; says the diminutive Mosley , voice charged with pain , spine stiff with indignation . &quot; He neither drank nor smoked . It was a slap in the face . . . . There ' s no justice in this government . They killed my husband , my children ' s father , and said they didn ' t. &quot; The workers case , as Mosley ' s was called , was the last big Nevada Test Site radiation lawsuit against the government to finish trial . This stretch of desert -- a restricted swath of sand and sagebrush larger than Rhode Island , pocked with craters from nuclear blasts and shrouded with the secrecy of its Cold_War past -- was the site of more nuclear_warhead detonations by the U.S._government than any other place in the world . More lawsuits have been focused_on this location , 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas , than on any other stop along the so-called Atomic Trail -- the nuclear_weapon ' s path from uranium mine through manufacturing_plant to proving ground . More protesters have been arrested here than at any other target of anti-nuclear activity in the country -- including more_than 1 # 200 on one day alone in 1988 . But with the workers case possibly at an end -- an appeal is uncertain -- and U.S. nuclear testing halted for at least the next 14 months , a notorious chapter in the nation ' s weapons history may be coming_to a close . As the United States heads toward next year ' s 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Nevada Test Site is_on the precipice of a dramatic change : * The world ' s nuclear_powers began meeting again last week in Geneva to continue work_on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty that could render the Nevada site unnecessary . * The U.S. Department_of_Energy is scrambling to figure_out what to do with 1 # 350 square_miles of irradiated Nevada desert . Among the options : turning the site into a Solar Enterprise_Zone for solar_energy research and development . A business / government task_force met Saturday in Las Vegas to discuss harnessing the above-100-degree summer temperatures , which department spokesman Darwin Morgan euphemistically calls &quot; our solar resources. &quot; * No new lawsuits are in the works to hold the government accountable for alleged radiation exposure to men , women , children and animals between the first blast at the test site in 1951 and the last in 1992 . &quot; The significance of the decision ( in the workers case ) is that , right or wrong , it ends . . . the legal history of the Cold_War nuclear_weapons testing project at the Nevada Test Site , &quot; says Larry Johns , an attorney for the plaintiffs . Had the July 20 decision in U.S. District Court gone_in favor of the six workers , says John Thorndal , an attorney involved in the government ' s successful defense , &quot; it could have opened_up the government to enormous financial exposure and probably clogged the courts for years here in Las Vegas. &quot; Like the seven other major radiation exposure lawsuits to come_out of the nation ' s nuclear_weapons program , the workers case was actually a combination of many other lawsuits , in this case for a grand total of 220 plaintiffs . Because class-action lawsuits against the government are not allowed , six of the individual cases -- including Hugh Mosley ' s -- were chosen to go_to trial . As a result , &quot; there was a substantial number of people claiming their diseases were caused by exposure at the test site , but the court ruled otherwise , &quot; Thorndal said . Driving south on U.S. 95 toward Las Vegas , there is very little indication that the hot , flat desert and dramatic mesas to the left hosted nuclear detonations , both aboveground and below , for 41 years . The off-ramp for the test site is marked simply &quot; Mercury , &quot; the name of the small support town within the restricted region . A &quot; No Services &quot; sign is tacked_on for good measure . Chain-link pens , constructed in the 1980s to hold protesters arrested during waves of demonstrations , gleam in the setting sun on the approach to the small , secretive town . According to the blue Adopt-a-Highway sign , the mile-and-a-half stretch of roadway bordering the test site was adopted last year by the Nevada Desert Experience , a &quot; faith-based &quot; anti-nuclear group whose members both protest the site and pick_up its highway litter . In the beginning , the Nevada Test Site was a symbol of pride , the place where the Atomic Age came_out of the closet when nuclear testing moved from the seclusion of little Pacific atolls to the glare of the continental United States , by order of President Harry S . Truman in 1951 . Early atmospheric tests became public relations events , with Las Vegas residents throwing rooftop viewing parties to watch the blasts . &quot; Moe Dalitz and Wilbur Clark planned the opening of the Desert Inn to coincide with a detonation , &quot; says Deke Castleman in &quot; The Nevada Handbook. &quot; &quot; A silent majority certainly worried which way the wind blew , and a vocal minority seemed to contract a strange ' atom fever , ' marketing everything from atom burgers to nuclear gasoline and appointing a yearly Miss Atomic Blast. &quot; Attorney Johns , who came_to spend nearly 25 years challenging the government ' s alleged cover-up of radiation exposure injuries , recalls the eerie early morning glow of nuclear shots that punctuated his Las Vegas boyhood . He participated in &quot; duck and cover &quot; drills at his elementary_school and remembers the mushroom_cloud emblazoned on the cover of the 1953 yearbook for Las Vegas High , where his father taught history . The Johnses rented their family home to a test site scientist one summer when they were away on vacation . &quot; There was a honeymoon , a love_affair that went_on here into the mid- ' 50s , &quot; Johns says . &quot; It was exciting . These were super scientists , and they were going_to save the world. &quot; Then things began to go_wrong . Nearly 5 # 000 sheep died after a string of strong blasts in 1953 called the Upshot-Knothole series . &quot; Wool sloughed off in clumps , most of the adult sheep had blisters and sores on their faces , and the new lambs were either stillborn with grotesque deformities or were so weak they were unable to nurse and died soon after birth , &quot; says Stewart Udall in his new book , &quot; The Myths of August. &quot; Udall , a former secretary_of_the_interior , has brought many of the cases against the government , including the workers case and unsuccessful lawsuits seeking compensation for uranium miners and so-called &quot; downwinders &quot; who lived_in the path of the radioactive fallout from the Nevada Test Site . In 1956 , U.S. District Judge Sherman A . Christensen ruled that the radiation doses received by the sheep were not enough to cause the carnage and that the government was not negligent . After congressional hearings in 1979 revealed that the government had falsified or withheld evidence during the trial , Christensen reversed his own decision and ordered a new trial . &quot; The conduct of the government amounted to a species of fraud on the court for which a remedy must be granted , &quot; Christensen said in his 1982 opinion . But four years later , the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Christensen ' s findings and canceled the new trial . Because of strict government secrecy and general scientific ignorance about the effects of radiation , it took until the 1970s for lawsuits to be filed_in large_numbers against the government , alleging that radiation exposure from the test site caused injury and death . Johns and Thorndal were opponents in the first big case of the 1970s , the Roberts and Nunamaker case . Johns filed the suit against the government and its contractors in 1972 , after an underground nuclear blast vented into the atmosphere , causing a 10 # 000-foot mushroom_cloud and exposing between 600 and 900 test site workers in 1970 . The two lawyers have become friendly adversaries over the last two decades . &quot; When I started the Roberts and Nunamaker case , it was the first one that laid a lot of the groundwork , &quot; says Thorndal . &quot; I had no kids when it started . Now my oldest is 22 and the youngest is 17. &quot; The case has gone_to the U.S. Court of Appeals three times and is still awaiting final resolution . It is the only big Nevada Test Site case that still has some life in it ( the government has won the other four ) ; attorneys have yet to decide whether to appeal the July 20 decision in the workers case . Darrin Tuck , for one , does not want to spend the rest of his life fighting the government on behalf of his dead father , a former test site worker and one of the plaintiffs in the workers case . &quot; It ' s a never-ending battle , &quot; he says over coffee at smoky Saddle West casino in Pahrump , Nev. , near Death_Valley . &quot; I could see that during the trial. &quot; Tuck , 35 , was fighting to avenge the premature death of his father , Calvin , who in 1974 succumbed to pancreatic_cancer at the age of 47 . Calvin Tuck had worked_at the Nevada Test Site for nine years as a radiation monitor , entering the tunnels after underground tests were held to see how much radiation was present . &quot; I ' d sit on his lap , play with his badge , feel his whiskers , because he ' d be gone_for two or three days at a time , &quot; recalls Tuck of his childhood and his father ' s top-secret job . &quot; I ' d get the James Bond fascination when I was younger . My mother said he couldn ' t talk_about it. &quot; Calvin Tuck did , however , talk_about the pain , which sent him to doctors throughout his final years at the test site in the late 1960s . One doctor said Tuck had gout , another said he didn ' t know what he had . The disease was finally diagnosed in 1971 and he died in 1974 . In the written opinion in the workers case , U.S. District Judge Philip Pro blamed Tuck ' s death on alcohol and cigarettes . &quot; That hurts me here , &quot; says Darrin Tuck , placing hand_over heart and cigarette pack . &quot; He was serving his country out there . He was a peacekeeper and didn ' t get recognition . All they say is he smoked and drank too_much . He ' s not getting credit for what he really did. &quot; Of the six men involved in the workers case , Keith Prescott of tiny Francis , Utah , can claim two major distinctions : Unlike Tuck and Mosley , his lifestyle was not fingered in his cancer diagnosis . And , after watching his friends and former colleagues die , one after the other , of painful cancers , he is the only living plaintiff . There was Robert Bergen , Prescott ' s boss when Prescott came_home from the test site for the last time at age 43 . Bergen died 15 years ago , he says , as he lists his catalogue of colleagues . Then there was Doug Godfrey , dead for perhaps a decade , and Cal Walters , a shift boss . &quot; Nearly all my best_friends that I worked with died of cancer , &quot; says Prescott , the former equipment operator who has battled multiple_myeloma , or tumors in his bone_marrow , for 25 years . &quot; I was a pallbearer for three of them . It ' s hard on you , I tell you. &quot; Now that the workers case appears to be over , Prescott is left with another reason to mourn : the loss of hope , the loss of pride . Deep down , he thought his case was so strong that simply getting_to trial -- a process that took 15 years -- would automatically lead to compensation . He hasn ' t worked since he was 43 ; he is 68 today , a dignified man who has always believed that he should earn his own , financially and emotionally . &quot; I had to rely_on my wife , &quot; he says . &quot; There was so_much my kids didn ' t get_to do . I just thought if I could get compensation , I could pay them back and earn my way. &quot; Prescott must , like the Department_of_Energy itself , now learn to move_on . As the department searches for new uses for the sprawling test site , Prescott searches for a reason to wake_up in the morning . &quot; I ' ve lost all_of my strength , vitality , determination , &quot; he says . &quot; That was a blow I didn ' t expect . There ' s not a thing you can do about it . I imagine after a while I ' ll get used to it. &quot; Alma Mosley would not say she ' s used to it , but the vantage_point is different when you ' re a survivor , not a victim . The 15 years of legal maneuvering , Mosley says , have had their advantages . For her , litigation is a memorial . &quot; The death of a loved one makes ( the legal battle ) very worthwhile , whether they compensate us or not , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s a way of not forgetting -- even though the government said they didn ' t do nothing. &quot;</TEXT>
