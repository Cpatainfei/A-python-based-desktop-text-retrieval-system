   <HEADLINE> IT ' S ALL ABOUT QUALITY_CONTROL ; ROBERT ALTMAN AND STEVEN SODERBERGH WON ' T MAKE A MOVIE THESE DAYS WITHOUT PETER GALLAGHER , BUT THAT WASN ' T ALWAYS THE CASE FOR THIS ACTOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s probably Mozart , some acoustical footnote to the name -- Cafe Mozart -- but just the overture for Peter Gallagher . He ' s run in , a little breathless , to grab a sandwich at this neighborhood cafe on the Upper West_Side , but the canned piano stops him dead . Even before he reaches his favorite corner table , he turns , cocks his head and segues into unprompted melodrama . &quot; Soon the talking stopped and we listened . And wept . And realized what was the point of going_on with the interview because we ' d be dead anyway , in the next 30 or 40 years. &quot; Gallagher drops his backpack to the table with a thud and sinks into a chair , smiling rather blissfully for an actor who up until recently had a hard_time getting anyone to take him seriously , musical accompaniments notwithstanding . He was a stage-trained performer , an accomplished song-and-dance man , who had done all those Broadway shows , big musicals like &quot; Hair &quot; and &quot; Grease , &quot; even plays with major-league directors -- &quot; A Doll ' s Life , &quot; with Hal Prince ; &quot; The Real_Thing , &quot; for Mike Nichols and &quot; Long ' s Day Journey Into Night , &quot; directed by Britain ' s Jonathan Miller . He had earned good notices , a_few awards , even a Tony nomination , but none of it seemed to matter in Hollywood , where Gallagher ' s name was tainted by his far less impressive foray_into film more_than a decade earlier . In Taylor Hackford ' s 1980 drama &quot; The Idolmaker , &quot; Gallagher played a Fabian-like rock_star , replete with chest-hair waxings and an overdose of publicity for the then-25-year-old newcomer with the Elvis Presley pout . &quot; Caesare is coming &quot; screamed the posters plastered with Gallagher ' s smoldering , dark-browed features . Coming and going was more like it ; the film disappeared with embarrassing speed , nearly capsizing the actor ' s fledgling film career . Two years later , when he played an equally depilated member of a menage-a-trois in Randal Kleiser ' s short-lived &quot; Summer Lovers , &quot; Gallagher thought he would never work again . It was &quot; that classic pretty boy thing , &quot; as director Robert Altman recalls , that can kill a serious actor ' s career . &quot; I ' d get amazing reviews in Broadway shows and then I would n ' t have an audition for a year , &quot; says Gallagher . &quot; So you ' d start to think , ' Yeah , I guess there is no market for people with big lips and fat eyebrows. ' &quot; That the 38-year-old actor with the strikingly Byronic features has struggled back from that inauspicious beginning to remain one of Broadway ' s more viable members while landing some of Hollywood ' s plummiest character roles says as much about the peculiar nature of success as it does about Gallagher ' s own talents and persistence . Although he still does not head many producers ' A-lists , Gallagher has shed that earlier stigma to become one of the more respected and busier characters working , in_demand for a variety of film , television and theater projects . Recent high-profile appearances include &quot; Mother ' s Boys , &quot; an erotic thriller co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis , and Joel and Ethan Coen ' s &quot; The Hudsucker Proxy , &quot; as well as an HBO movie , &quot; White Mile , &quot; which airs later this month . * He also remains the actor of choice for a handful of acclaimed auteurs , most notably Altman , who has worked with the actor on &quot; The Player &quot; and &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; and Steven Soderbergh , whose 1989 drama , &quot; sex , lies , and videotape , &quot; marked Gallagher ' s first unqualified hit and whose next film , &quot; The Underneath , &quot; was written for the actor . &quot; After ' sex , lies , and videotape , ' I certainly saw more ( scripts ) , &quot; says Gallagher . But it ' s all about the long_haul , when I started_out , John Travolta was big and I got work because I had vaguely Italianate looks . Then that changed . I fully expect to have several careers , or chapters of careers. &quot; &quot; We all end_up in categories , &quot; adds Altman , who has said that he looks_for a role for Gallagher in each of his films . &quot; But Peter is a terrific actor , and very courageous because he plays a character regardless of their weakness or badness . He doesn ' t posture himself as a hero. &quot; Although he is perhaps still best known to audiences for playing those protagonists whom Altman describes as &quot; handsome , vain and sleazy &quot; -- John Milaney , the cheating husband in &quot; sex , lies , and videotape , &quot; Larry Levy , the back-stabbing studio executive in &quot; The Player &quot; and Stormy Weathers , the volatile helicopter pilot in &quot; Short Cuts &quot; -- Gallagher has amassed a fairly catholic range of roles on his resume . In addition to those earlier theater productions , Gallagher originated the role of Sky Masterson in the recent Broadway revival of &quot; Guys and Dolls &quot; -- and turned_down starring roles in the Los Angeles production of &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; and the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot; Passione. &quot; In &quot; Mother ' s Boys , &quot; he plays the devoted father of three young sons , his first sympathetic leading man role to date . In Alan Rudolph ' s &quot; Mrs . Parker , &quot; which is being shown at Cannes this month , he portrays Alan Campbell , the beleaguered alcoholic husband of writer Dorothy Parker , played by Jennifer Jason Leigh . In &quot; White Mile , &quot; he plays a naive advertising executive under the spell of a Machiavellian boss played by Alan Alda . And in &quot; The Underneath , &quot; which will be released early next year , he portrays an older version of his &quot; sex , lies , and videotape &quot; persona , &quot; a guy who ' s always gotten_by on his looks and charm , &quot; as Soderbergh says , &quot; but who now has to come_to terms with that. &quot; &quot; Yes , I ' m in every movie that ' s coming next year , &quot; Gallagher deadpans . &quot; If you look carefully in crowd scenes , I ' m there . It ' s like , ' Where ' s Waldo ? Where ' s Gallagher ? ' &quot; And in &quot; White Mile , &quot; Gallagher can be spotted clinging_to a rubber raft careening down some of New Zealand ' s most challenging white-water rapids in a film , directed by Robert Butler from a script by Michael Butler , that Gallagher calls , somewhat tongue-in-cheek , &quot; an allegory for the ' 80s. &quot; He plays a young advertising executive , the protege of particularly competitive CEO ( Alda ) who , in a story line strikingly similar to the annual raft trip hosted by Disney ' s Jeffrey Katzenberg , invites colleagues along on a treacherous white-water outing . &quot; It becomes this whole ( expletive ) contest that ' s all about ruthless ambition and the lack of responsibility , &quot; says Gallagher , adding wryly , &quot; Of course my character is in conflict about his boss ' motives. &quot; Currently , Gallagher is weighing offers from several producers to star in a variety of comedies , which only recently he has begun to explore . &quot; Peter is one of the smartest and funniest actors , &quot; says Soderbergh . &quot; He ' s not a jokester , but makes characters funny in a dark way and by his ( intended ) lack of irony. &quot; * And sitting in this cafe just around the corner from the co-op he shares with his wife , Paula Harwood , an independent producer , and their two young children , Gallagher seems far more engaging and ingenuous -- not to mention being a devoted family_man -- than his film roles might suggest . His darkly handsome looks , while striking testimony to his Irish-Catholic background , seem also to be mellowing , &quot; deepening &quot; as Soderbergh says . Mostly , his appearance serves as an ironic counterpoint to his unassuming breezy affability , a sanguinity born_out of his experiences on Broadway and in Hollywood . In fact , Gallagher can be scathing about certain events . He doesn ' t hesitate to disparage several Broadway producers , including those of &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; who wanted him to star with Glenn Close during the production ' s Los Angeles run : &quot; I couldn ' t afford to do_it because they were offering $ 1 # 000 a month living expenses , and to hear Andrew Lloyd Webber cry poverty . . . . &quot; He is also startlingly candid about the film_industry , the paucity of well-written character parts , agents who make actors &quot; feel_like it ' s your fault that you haven ' t an audition for a year , &quot; and what he sees as the industry ' s prejudice against actors who , as he quips , &quot; don ' t operate under the burden of wanting to be liked. &quot; Hollywood , he says simply , &quot; rewards people who have the savvy or good_fortune to have significant roles in successful movies. &quot; Even &quot; Mother ' s Boys , &quot; a film he concedes offered him the opportunity to play a more realistic role than most thrillers , was not his first choice when Harvey Weinstein , president of Miramax Films , the producers of &quot; sex , lies , and videotape , &quot; first approached him about the work . &quot; I had a lot of problems with the script , &quot; Gallagher says , &quot; but they made some changes and because they ' d gotten_into a little bit of a scheduling jam , I did it. &quot; * Yet he also shows a touching lack of ego . Despite his impressive Broadway credits , he insists he doesn ' t have &quot; the musical chops &quot; some actors do , and he jokes about being replaced in the workshop version of Sondheim ' s new musical , &quot; Hey , lets get Mandy ( Patinkin ) because he sings higher. &quot; He refers to himself as &quot; a late bloomer &quot; and characterizes his career with a blithe &quot; I don ' t think anything is going_to help at this point. &quot; And no amount of success , he adds , snapping open his wallet with its requisite photograph of his two children , a 3-year-old son and an infant daughter , &quot; would make_it worth ( compromising ) the life we ' re trying to build with our family . Yeah , I ' d love to have bigger parts that give you more room to express yourself , but I really believe there is no formula and the truth is , I ' m happiest when I ' m just working well. &quot; If anything characterizes Gallagher ' s approach to his craft it is his love of collaboration , fostered by his years in theater but less called_upon in his film experiences . &quot; Film can ' t really be successful unless it is the product of a single vision , &quot; he says , &quot; but that vision can be expansive enough to include others at their fullest. &quot; Soderbergh and Altman clearly agree . &quot; I cast Peter in ' sex , lies , and videotape ' because I needed an actor who was smart enough to flesh_out the least well-written of the four characters , &quot; says Soderbergh . &quot; I needed him to come_up with good stuff and Peter had great ideas about how to make the husband more real , funnier and also darker. &quot; As for Altman , with whom he first worked with on the 1988 TV movie &quot; The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial , &quot; Gallagher describes the director &quot; as almost painterly in his approach . He creates the environment where something might occur and gives you the freedom to go_with it . It ' s why we all sing Bob ' s praises , because he loves actors -- his taste isn ' t market-based , it ' s very personal -- and he allows us to do our work. &quot; As Soderbergh puts it , &quot; Like most good actors , Peter is not afraid that the character reflects on him . He ' s not afraid to make them real jerks. &quot; Indeed , after Gallagher resuscitated his career from the pretty-boy label , he found himself pigeonholed again after &quot; sex , lies , and videotape &quot; was the surprise winner at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival -- a prejudice not helped by the producer ' s use of promotional_material that included admiring quotes from reviewers for every performance but his . &quot; Because I played the least sympathetic characters , I knew that people who weren ' t familiar_with my work would say , ' Boy , he ' s an ( expletive ) ! Next ! ' &quot; But as Gallagher is quick to point_out , there are bad_guys and there are bad_guys . &quot; In most movies if you ' re not playing the lead , you ' re supposed to make_sure audiences know who you are with just a_few moments of screen time , and if you ' re the bad_guy , you ' re supposed to spell it out_in real obvious ways . But people aren ' t like that in real_life . The most interesting bad_guys are the ones you ' d least expect. &quot; The youngest son of an outdoor advertising businessman -- &quot; you know , billboards ! &quot; he laughs -- and a bacteriologist , Gallagher was raised in Armonk , N.Y. , in a conservative Irish American family beset by many of the insecurities common to second-generation Americans . &quot; We knew_nothing of the world of show_business , &quot; he recalls . &quot; We didn ' t go_to many movies and I think I was actually in a play before I saw one . I never really considered a career in show business. &quot; Despite an interest in musical_theater developed in high_school and a summer studying voice at the New England Conservatory , Gallagher attended Tufts University in Boston where , at his father ' s urging , he obtained a degree in economics . He even spent a semester studying Marxist theory at UC-Berkeley . But theater eventually wooed him back . After spending three seasons working with the Boston Shakespeare Company , Gallagher moved_back to New York and immediately began to work_on Broadway , playing the starring role of Danny Zuko in &quot; Grease &quot; in 1972 . Almost two decades later , Gallagher still finds that link to New York ' s theater community remains pivotal . It ' s the main reason why he refuses to settle in Los Angeles , where he sees actors &quot; treated like poker_chips , &quot; of differing value , and &quot; where the only thing you can count_on is that your value won ' t stay the same from week to week. &quot; &quot; New York is where I ' m from and it helps remind me who I am when I ' m here , &quot; he adds , looking_around the cafe as if he were about to burst into song . &quot; I just believe there is no way to anticipate the success of something . You only have control over what you do and choosing people to work with that have sympathetic points_of_view . If you do that , you can be enriched by the experience. &quot; *</TEXT>
