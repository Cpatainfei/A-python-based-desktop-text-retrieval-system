   <HEADLINE> PROBE INDICATES AMATEURS PLOTTED ASSASSINATION OF MEXICAN POLITICIAN ; LATIN_AMERICA : HIRED GUNS SKIPPED_TOWN WITH THOUSANDS FROM ALLEGED RINGLEADERS IN KILLING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All Carmelo Herrera Gomez knew when his lover summoned him to meet a well-connected businessman at a cheap Mexico_City hotel in June was that it involved &quot; a matter of a lot of money. &quot; When he got there , according to Herrera ' s sworn testimony released Thursday , he learned that he would have to kill for it . The target : Francisco Ruiz Massieu . The reward : nearly $ 100 # 000 . At the prodding of his girlfriend , Herrera agreed . It was not until several days later , Herrera stated , that he learned that his prospective target was no less than the second-ranking official in Mexico ' s powerful ruling political_party . &quot; Too risky , &quot; Herrera decided , and he fled , along with his girlfriend and tens of thousands of dollars in prospective blood_money . According to the latest testimony made public , that was the second time the alleged masterminds of a killing that rocked Mexico last month were burned by hired guns who skipped_town with their money . And it was the latest evidence that the political aides and underworld figures now charged with plotting Ruiz Massieu ' s murder here on Sept . 28 were amateurs , at best . According to the hundreds of pages of testimony that the government is accumulating under the direction of Ruiz Massieu ' s brother , Mario , who is heading the investigation for Mexico ' s attorney_general ' s office , it is nothing short of amazing that the assassination took_place at all . After several hired killers backed_out and disappeared with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash_in the spring during the two previous attempts to have Ruiz Massieu killed , the man who finally carried_out the job nearly failed : The assassin ' s Tec-9 pistol jammed after he got_off a single shot . Soon after , the testimony indicates , one of the co-conspirators who had attempted to hire Herrera and his girlfriend -- and the others before them -- was easily traced to the home of his mistress . He had forgotten to get a visa to use a plane_ticket that he said he had been given to escape to France . With the exception of fugitive ruling-party legislator Manuel Munoz Rocha , a key suspect who continues to elude a nationwide dragnet and an FBI hunt in the United States , most of those identified as the principal co-conspirators in Ruiz Massieu ' s slaying are now in custody . It is that same amateurish plotting , it seems , that has allowed Deputy Prosecutor General Mario Ruiz Massieu to reconstruct his brother ' s killing with such methodical ease . More difficult for the veteran prosecutor as he assembles the testimony of more_than a dozen accused conspirators -- some of it implicating key members of_his_own ruling party -- has been the political tightrope he has had to walk . Responding to charges from leaders of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , that his daily disclosures of suspects ' sworn statements have been &quot; inappropriate , &quot; the prosecutor strenuously and emotionally defended himself at a news_conference Tuesday . Ruiz Massieu said the decision to publicize the testimony is essential for a &quot; fed-up society that wants to know the truth. &quot; Unstated but clearly implied is widespread public dissatisfaction with the progress of another high-profile investigation -- the probe into the March slaying of ruling-party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , which officially is still blamed on a single gunman . A former deputy prosecutor has suggested a nexus between Mexican narcotics traffickers and corrupt , hard-line politicians behind the slaying of Colosio . Like Ruiz Massieu , Colosio cast himself as a ruling-party reformer . During his news_conference , Mario Ruiz Massieu said he was open_to suggestions that a similar link was behind his brother ' s killing . But at_the_same_time , Ruiz Massieu found himself facing widely publicized concerns that his own party loyalties -- and his political future -- could overwhelm his desire to uncover the extent of the conspiracy behind his brother ' s killing . If the plot to kill his reform-minded brother goes much higher than a single renegade legislator , critics say Ruiz Massieu may be reluctant to pursue it . &quot; Neither lies , malicious plots nor slander &quot; will deter the probe , he declared , adding : &quot; We are investigating presumed criminals independently of their political affiliation . It has been said that I will trade my future in exchange for a subsequent political position . This is false and insulting. &quot; Finally , the prosecutor denied charges that his investigation has become increasingly confused and bogged down in minutiae . &quot; There is no confusion about anything , &quot; he said . &quot; And in any case , the advance of the investigation will clarify doubts. &quot; Mexicans and outsiders alike , though , are confused by the intricate web of relationships among the accused co-plotters . Among the 15 men and women caught so far in the prosecutor ' s net are various sets of brothers , lovers , couples and friends . At the core of the plot that prosecutors have presented to the public are three brothers named Rodriguez Gonzalez : Fernando , Jorge and Marco Antonio . Fernando was a legislative aide to the renegade Munoz Rocha , whom all three brothers say ordered Ruiz Massieu ' s killing and offered $ 1 million for the job as long ago as 1993 . Prosecutors say the brothers have further testified that Fernando initially used Marco as his front_man , the original recruiter who hired Herrera and his girlfriend to kill not only Ruiz Massieu but also the other hired guns who had fled with advance payments . When Herrera and his lover disappeared , the Rodriguez Gonzalez family closed ranks . Fernando ' s wife and her family were brought_in on the plot , which some of their testimony indicates went from targeting Francisco Ruiz Massieu and the previous hired guns to include an extensive hit list . On that roster were the names of other senior ruling-party officials who favored reform . Finally , testimony indicates , Fernando turned_to his brother Jorge to recruit the assassin and purchase weaponry . They bought the machine_pistol for about $ 600 and an AK-47 assault_rifle for about $ 1 # 300 from a rural police_officer in their home state of Tamaulipas . The police_officer is now in custody . Jorge later confessed in sworn testimony that for $ 15 # 000 , he enlisted Daniel Aguilar Trevino , a ranch_hand from Tamaulipas , to fire a full clip from the 9-millimeter machine_pistol into Ruiz Massieu outside a hotel in Mexico_City . Aguilar , the first to be arrested in the case , was tackled in the driveway of the Casa Blanca Hotel when the gun jammed .</TEXT>
