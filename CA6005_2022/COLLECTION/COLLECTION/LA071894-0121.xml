   <TEXT> Soccer is cruel , fate is relentless and the most coveted championship in the world hinged_on the caprice of a leather boot striking a leather ball on a chalk spot 12 yards from a goal . The monthlong efforts of the national teams of Brazil and Italy -- toiling in the twin caldrons of summer heat and passionate expectations in their nations -- came_to the most dramatic , sudden , and , for Italy , heartbreaking conclusion Sunday afternoon in the Rose Bowl . After 90 scoreless minutes of regulation play and 30 scoreless minutes of overtime , the World Cup championship was decided by penalty kicks . Brazil won , 3-2 , and thus won a historic fourth World Cup title , its first since 1970 . Italy , which had again and again in this tournament fought_back from the brink , watched in horror as Franco Baresi , the oldest and most experienced player on the field , missed the first penalty shot taken . Minutes later a nation shuddered as the team ' s savior , the injured Roberto Baggio , sent his make-or-break shot high over the crossbar , soaring on the same arc as Brazil ' s cheers . Brazilian Coach Carlos Albert Parreira , pilloried in his country for every decision he has made , was drained but jubilant after the game . &quot; I was like Frank Sinatra , &quot; he said . &quot; I did_it my way , I did_it my way . I ' ve never played a more dramatic game in my life . I felt we were going_to get the victory , it was just a matter of capitalizing on opportunities . This was just like life. &quot; Many in the crowd of 94 # 194 in the Rose Bowl had chosen to become Brazil fans for a day , those arrayed in the national yellow and green swaying to the ever-present drumbeat . Those newly converted soccer acolytes saw a game dominated by defense in which the premier offensive players made negligible offerings in the face of smothering defense . Italy played Brazil only slightly differently than the rest of the champion ' s opponents . Whereas most teams pack the defense and look_for a counterattack , Italy had vague notions about attacking , but Brazil ' s underrated back line and Italy ' s depleted roster made successful forward runs impossible . Always overshadowed by the team ' s brilliant offense , few noticed Brazil ' s defense had given_up only three goals . Baggio , the world player of the year in 1993 , was reduced by a hamstring strain to half-speed forays to get_to space where , a week ago , he would have been dangerous . Before the game , the tactical discussions centered_on whether to man-mark Baggio or stay in a zone . As the game wore_on , Baggio did not even merit a defender to pick him up . Brazil , too , lost a key player to injury . Jorginho , the right back given the responsibility of bringing the ball_up the wing , injured his thigh muscle early in the first_half and was replaced by Cafu . Without Jorginho ' s service to Romario and Bebeto , Brazil attacked through the middle , with little success . Present in body but absent in impact was Bebeto , who became Romario ' s silent_partner Sunday . Defender Paolo Maldini was moved by Coach Arrigo Sacchi in the first_half to deal with Bebeto and Maldini shut him down . He might have been the best player on the field for either team . There were few chances in the tightly played first_half , and Brazil had them , for the most part . The best came when Branco teed_up a free_kick that was punched_out by Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca at the near post . Mazinho rushed in_for the rebound but topped the ball and didn ' t get a clean shot at the open net . Brazil had a dangerous chance again in the second_half . Mauro Silva let_loose a hard shot that Pagliuca saved and tried to gather while in a crouch . The ball bounced off his knee and spun toward the net . It bounced off the post and back into Pagliuca ' s arms . Italy ' s only credible chance came late in the second_half . Roberto Donadoni crossed the ball in from the right_wing . Baggio ' s first touch controlled the ball and with his second he turned and shot . In an awful foreshadowing , Baggio ' s shot flew over the net . The players gathered themselves for overtime that produced a_few close_calls but little else . Romario had a chance in front , but missed . Having failed to score in overtime , the teams were sent , for the first time in a World Cup championship match , to penalty kicks . Before they began , Brazil ' s team arranged itself into a circle and held hands , praying . &quot; We really felt the hands of God on us , &quot; goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel said . As it happened , his were the divine hands , making a key save of a penalty kick , against all odds and the shooter ' s great advantage . Baresi went first , stepping_up and shooting high . The Italian captain sank to his knees at the mistake and Taffarel threw a comforting arm around Baresi as he left the goal for Pagliuca . The Italian keeper saved Marcio Santos ' shot and suddenly everything was very , very tense . Demetrio Albertini made his shot and Romario made his to draw even , 1-1 . Alberigo Evani and Branco each made a left-footer to make_it 2-2 . Daniele Massaro lined_up and aimed right . Taffarel guessed as much and his save , in turn , saved Brazil . Dunga faked left and shot right to give Brazil a 3-2 lead before Baggio was to shoot . Baggio carefully placed the ball and strode forward . His shot went higher and higher , over the bar and into the stands , where Brazil ' s fans were already celebrating . It was obvious that Baggio was not himself . &quot; I thought Baggio was really hurting , &quot; Brazilian defender Aldair said . &quot; I think he can do much better than that . Baresi is not a kicker . And Baggio made a mistake. &quot; After the miss , Baggio was inconsolable and walked alone . Pagliuca rolled on the grass , as if in physical pain . Brazil ' s team stood_in a yellow and green knot in the center of the field , draped in flags and basking in the cheers that rained_down . As Baggio had said before the game , Hope is the last to die . * OTHER COVERAGE : C6-15SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIPS</TEXT>
