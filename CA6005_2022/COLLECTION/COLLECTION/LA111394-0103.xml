   <HEADLINE> CONSUMERS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO PUC PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The article outlining alternative proposals to the state Public_Utilities Commission ' s plan to deregulate the electric industry ( &quot; Proposals Add Confusion for State ' s Users of Electricity , &quot; Oct . 24 ) reflected the views of the utilities and environmentalists but left_out the consumer viewpoint altogether . For the record , there is a consumer-led alternative to the PUC ' s plan : It is called Community Access to Competitive Electricity.Put forth by the consumer group Toward Utility Rate Normalization , community access would allow all Californians -- not just the big guys -- to share_in the benefits of competition in the electricity marketplace . Unlike the PUC ' s &quot; direct access &quot; proposal , which gives early competitive choice to large customers but holds small customers captive to the utility and its high prices until at least 2002 , community access would bring lower rates through competition to all customers at_the_same_time . Community access would empower large and small customers within a community to harness their collective market power to get better deals for all . Local_government agencies would serve as purchasing agents for all customers within their jurisdiction and negotiate for low-cost power on the wholesale market for electricity . Communities would be able to choose how much power should come from renewable sources and how much funding would be devoted to energy efficiency and other social goals . The PUC ' s plan , on the other hand , could throw all these policy goals by the wayside . Any reform of the electric industry should provide meaningful choice to all consumers . Community access can achieve this goal . The PUC ' s direct-access proposal cannot . AUDRIE KRAUSE Executive_Director Toward Utility Rate Normalization San Francisco</TEXT>
