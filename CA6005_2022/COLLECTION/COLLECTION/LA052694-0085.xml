   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; PICKING_UP THE TRAIL OF LOST CIVILIZATIONS ; ARCHEOLOGISTS GET VOLUNTEER HELP AS THEY UNEARTH CLUES IN SITES NESTLED THROUGHOUT THE ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Retired police Lt . Doug Collisson always loved a good mystery . Now , deep in the Angeles National Forest , the dogged 49-year-old is_on the trail of perhaps the biggest whodunit of his life -- with 4 # 000-year-old clues . Collisson is part of a volunteer archeological crew , snooping for the secrets of these ancient woods . The archeological team is trying to reconstruct the past , much the way Collisson once did on the homicide beat_in South Los Angeles . But this time , he and other history buffs are trying to solve mysteries of antiquity : What Native_American tribes lived and died in the San Gabriel Mountains ? Did they head for the mountains only in the balmy days of spring so they could make tents out of the blooming yucca plants and grass mats , and to beat the wily squirrels to the pine_nuts ? Or at other times of the year as well ? What did they trade to get their precious obsidian , volcanic_glass from the eastern Sierra that they used for knives and projectile points ? &quot; A good crime scene . that ' s what we ' ve got here , &quot; said Collisson , who lives_in the east San Gabriel Valley . &quot; Some very small clues , but eventually the whole picture will come together. &quot; The three-week excavation project , in the Arroyo Seco District , started May 9 and ends today . There are no answers yet , but four professional archeologists who led the dig will study the excavated material , which includes arrowheads , grinding stones and charred animal bones , evidence of cooking . In a related project , seven volunteers and a paid consultant returned Sunday from a nine-day hike into the remote Sheep Mountain Wilderness , where they documented gold mining sites from the 1850s and early 1900s for the first time . Consultants will prepare reports on both sites for forest officials , who will provide the information to researchers , develop plans to protect the sites and possibly develop interpretive displays with the artifacts . For the first time , the Angeles National Forest this year is participating in a nationwide U.S. Forest Service_program called &quot; Passport in Time , &quot; which started in 1989 as a way to encourage public involvement and get free labor . The program allows rangers to research historic sites for which they have had neither the money nor the staff to preserve and document . Forest archeologist Michael McIntyre said the program provides a rare opportunity to examine sites . With only two archeologists for the 694 # 000-acre forest , there is little time to do much except note the existence of a site with historical potential , he said . The forest contains 400 sites that are recorded at UCLA ' s Archeological Information Center , 95 % of which are unexplored . Instead , the sites are left to the vagaries of weather , looters and animals , said McIntyre , who was hired in 1981 as the forest ' s first archeologist . &quot; We try not to call any attention to it , &quot; McIntyre said . &quot; Leave it alone , record it and hope no one notices. &quot; McIntyre shakes his head at the cost of neglect . Twenty years ago , for instance , after Forest Service rangers tried to shore_up a river bank , the river changed_course and washed_away Native_American rock art in San Gabriel Canyon . The two Passport in Time projects allow the Forest Service to begin chipping_away_at its backlog of historical and archeological sites . For the Native_American project , the chance to chase history drew 31 volunteers -- including residents of Idaho , Arizona and Texas -- to a hilly site crowded with Jeffrey Pine , sagebrush and wild rose . Some of the sunburned volunteers fell_into their sleeping_bags as early as 8 p.m. , exhausted after a long day lugging dirt-filled buckets that turned their arms to stone and fighting_off swarming gnats that dived into their eyes . Volunteers included a certified_public_accountant who was born in West Germany , a yellow pages advertising representative who started the cold mornings with extra-strong coffee and a grandmother in a floppy straw_hat -- people who usually don ' t get the chance to bite down on an excavated pea-sized chip to see if it is hard and clinks against the teeth , a test to help determine if it is bone material . And on the 21-mile gold mine research hike , past the Bridge to Nowhere and through woods with no trails , volunteers lugged 75-pound backpacks up steep mountains , keeping their eyes open for black_bears , mountain_lions and rattlesnakes . It ' s all_in the name of history ; it certainly can ' t be for the money . The unpaid volunteers bring their own food and camping gear . Projects , which last from a week to several months , are listed in a nationally distributed catalogue that describes the site and any prerequisites for participation , such_as age and hiking expertise . So far , 230 projects have been sponsored nationwide . Among them : a Coronado National Forest project in Arizona to excavate Old Camp Rucker , a small military_post that sent_out Indian scouts to search for Apaches ; and a Nebraska National Forest project to record 6 # 000-year-old prehistoric sites in the Great Plains , where researchers have already uncovered a hearth and butchered bison bone . Along the way , volunteers have made discoveries of_their_own . For instance , in North_Dakota , volunteers who searched for Custer ' s 7th Calvary ' s trail to the Little_Bighorn_River unexpectedly stumbled across evidence of the army ' s camp sites -- a piece of history that might otherwise have been lost , said Kathleen Schamel , Passport in Time coordinator in Washington . &quot; We have these sites , we don ' t know what they are and we have to interpret them and find_out how they fit into the grand scheme of our nation ' s history , &quot; Schamel said . No federal money is earmarked for the Passport in Time project . Instead , officials from each participating national forest use funds from their cultural resources budget . For the Native_American project , Angeles National Forest officials allocated about $ 23 # 000 to hire archeology firm C.A. Singer &amp; Associates Inc. of Cambria and $ 15 # 000 for the mining expedition , led by paleontologist Steven W . Conkling of LSA Associates Inc. , an Irvine-based environmental firm . In the Angeles National Forest , archeological sites are usually discovered as part of a cursory investigation for environmental impact reports , which are state-required documents for construction projects such_as roads and trails . During the investigation , McIntyre or his assistant looks_for signs of past habitation . Dark soil , for instance , often indicates the presence of organic materials such_as food remains and human_waste . The sites stay secret until researchers can get_to them ( burial_grounds , however , are left untouched by the Forest Service ) . By law , archeological sites recorded at UCLA ' s local clearinghouse are secret -- disclosed only to researchers -- and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act . Some , however , are opened_up after excavation for interpretive displays . In popular hiking areas , sites with archeological potential are closed_off but unmarked , while sites in remote areas are simply left alone . Forest Service officials learned about the one-acre Native_American site 14 years ago , by word_of_mouth . &quot; People said , ' Oh yeah , as kids we used to come_up here and collect artifacts , ' &quot; McIntyre said . And , a_few years ago on the site , McIntyre found a granite grinding stone , called a mono , and a flat milling stone , called a metate , both of which Native_Americans used to grind grain into flour for cakes , gruel and bread . But Angeles forest officials did not have the money to do anything but tuck the finds away -- until the Passport in Time project came_along . In preparation for the excavation and preservation of the Native_American site , forest officials last winter made permanent changes : altering the path of a trail to avoid the site and moving some camping and equestrian facilities . Forest officials picked the site for a Passport in Time project because of the potential for rich archeological finds . They also were worried that hikers , campers and horses would damage the well-traveled area before they could get_to it . The dig was slow and painstaking , 10 centimeters of dirt at a time , but one that the volunteers cherished . &quot; I don ' t look_at this as a piece of stone , &quot; said 56-year-old Baerbel Struthers , fingering bits of excavated material . &quot; I look_at it like , ' Who had it ? And what did they do with it ? ' &quot; Struthers , a certified_public_accountant , drove 90 minutes to the site with two friends from Sherman Oaks every morning for a week . The trio wanted the chance to record history . &quot; You are the one who is capable of showing other people this exists , &quot; said her friend Geneva Massara , a 63-year-old yellow pages sales representative . In the Sheep Mountain Wilderness , volunteers looked_for evidence at old cabins , mines and mills , which previously had not been explored in_depth . In a heavily wooded and overgrown area , where volunteers tried unsuccessfully to avoid poison_oak , the group found remains of miners ' cabins made from hand-hewn pine , oak and cedar , said Conkling , the group leader . The group also found old beer_cans , a rusty shell of a 1920s-era Packard with wooden spokes about a mile from the mining site and mining equipment , such_as a mill that was used to grind ore . Conkling will sift through the artifacts and write a report on how the miners lived and worked in the mountains . On the hike ' s first day , volunteer Elizabeth Rothman -- 5 feet , 4 inches and 132 pounds -- staggered under the weight of a bulging 75-pound backpack that included her favorite camping meal : instant mashed potatoes with dried onions and Parmesan cheese . Rothman , a 39-year-old sign_language interpreter from Seattle , couldn ' t wait to get a glimpse into the lives of miners who worked so hard with so little promise of return . Unlike the miners , she knew what she was getting_back as an unpaid volunteer , hiking into a thick forest and climbing mountains with a 3 # 000-foot elevation gain in less than a mile . She said simply : &quot; It enriches our appreciation of where we live to know what happened there before. &quot; Volunteering to Dig What : &quot; Passport in Time &quot; is a U.S. Forest Service_program that recruits volunteers for archeological and historic preservation projects . When : Catalogues are published twice annually . The current catalogue lists 84 upcoming projects , none of which are in Southern California . Cost : There is no charge . Volunteers are unpaid and must provide their own transportation , food and , if necessary , camping gear . Where : In national forests around the country . Duration : Projects range from one week to several months . Participants can arrange to show_up for only part of a project , but most projects require a minimum stay of two days . Project examples : In Georgia ' s Chattahoochee National Forest , volunteers will help excavate a rock shelter containing pottery and other artifacts of the period from 2000 BC to 1000 AD , as well as a rock shelter used as a Civil War draft-dodgers ' hide-out ; in Idaho ' s Salmon National Forest , volunteers and archeologists will go white-water rafting on the Salmon_River , looking_for evidence of Native_Americans and hermits who lived_in the rugged canyons . Requirements : These vary , but most projects require that participants be at least 18 years old . Some prefer experience in archeology , carpentry or hiking , but several do not require experience . Settings : Some sites are in remote areas with no running water ; others are near motels and bed-and-breakfasts . Information : ( 202 ) 293-0922 , or write : Passport in Time Clearinghouse , P.O.
