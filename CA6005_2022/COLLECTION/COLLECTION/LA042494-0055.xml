   <HEADLINE> SOUND &amp; VISION : PUMPKINS FLOAT IN SEARCH OF THE LOST INNER CHILD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Childhood lost and found is a popular media theme these days -- but of course nowhere more so than among rock ' n ' rollers , whose &quot; inner children &quot; are usually a little closer to the surface , waiting to be slapped upside the head . Smashing Pumpkins ' tender yet bitter &quot; Disarm &quot; continues in heavy rotation on MTV after three months on the air , no doubt because its look_back at a little boy learning how to be hard strikes_a_chord with viewers who ' ve been there distantly or ( considering the demographics ) just recently . This edition of Sound &amp; Vision -- where current music videos are reviewed and rated on a 0-100 scale -- also extends downward to include less gracefully nostalgic fare , from Seaweed ' s awfully funny &quot; Kid Candy &quot; to Enigma ' s awfully cheesy &quot; Return to Innocence. &quot; Let the returnee beware . Smashing Pumpkins , &quot; Disarm. &quot; Remember that Talking Heads hit &quot; And She Was , &quot; where the woman drifts up into the air_out of her back yard for no apparent reason ? that ' s what comes_to_mind as Billy Corgan and crew get similarly float-atious here , though their ballad isn ' t nearly so buoyant . Corgan ' s wrenching , string-laden anthem represents a sort of dead-end attempt at reconvening with the &quot; inner child. &quot; So director Jake Scott ' s lighter-than-air design suggests that there ' s a rush or elevation to these kind of therapeutic recollections of abandoned youth , but that the gravity of the compromised adult world never really loses hold . The foursome is seen in tight black-and-white close-up floating just over the gleaming spires of a city ' s housetops , but they never get too high . It ' s not a terribly expressionist video -- Corgan not being the type of guy to wear his heart on his sleeve in more_than one medium at a time -- but the pathos is still smashing enough . 78 Seaweed , &quot; Kid Candy. &quot; From childhood lost to childishness regained . . . . Here ' s the first really funny parody clip in a long while , as Seaweed irreverently spoofs Soul Asylum ' s award-winning &quot; Runaway Train &quot; video , which dramatized the tragic plight of abducted kids and runaways left to the streets . This Sub Pop satire publicizes the plight of missing bikes , following an opening crawl that warns , &quot; Over five zillion bicycles are stolen every year , &quot; with a vivid dramatization of a daring ten-speed heist at a suburban mall . And , a la Soul Asylum ' s milk-carton-like clip , the scenario is punctuated by still photos of totally boss two-wheelers with sad captions like &quot; Missing since February. &quot; If you ' ve seen this Schwinn , don ' t call Dave Pirner . 73 Rollins Band , &quot; Liar. &quot; Henry Rollins never seems to fare too well whenever anyone puts him in a movie -- they haven ' t yet found a bit role that can realistically accommodate his malevolent masculinity -- but his videos offer a better context for caricature . He ' s as exaggerated as usual playing the role of &quot; Liar , &quot; flagrantly warning all comers that he ' s just the type of gent who ' ll tell women whatever they most want to hear and then laugh as he screws them over . The tattooed one even puts_on cherry-red body makeup , and the vaguely satanic guise seems to complete him , sort of the way Tim Curry really seemed home at last in his full &quot; Legend &quot; monster get-up . Subtleties be damned : He ' s the_devil inside , and out . 69 Salt-N-Pepa with En Vogue , &quot; Whatta Man. &quot; This salute is intended as homage to the modern male at his strong and sensitive best -- a corrective of sorts to rap ' s usual gender wars -- and fairly succeeds . But what the video ends_up being an even bigger tribute to is Salt-N-Pepa ' s personal trainers . Competing with the trio ' s newfound molten-steel midriffs , meanwhile , are Dawn Robinson ' s phenomenal go-go bangs ; there ' s just enough glory in reinvention here to go_around for Everygal . Did somebody say something about guys ? 68 Ace of Base , &quot; The Sign. &quot; These Swedes have been labeled &quot; the new ABBA , &quot; which is heady -- probably too heady -- praise indeed , at least to those of us who still hold the Scandinavian superstars of the ' 70s dear as irreplaceable demigods . But &quot; The Sign &quot; is a good sign that Ace of Base might measure_up in some way , and not just because they share an ingenuous fondness for the capital letters A and B . Despite an obvious contemporary gloss , the women dance just as feebly yet sexily , and the men strike just the same kind of lovably pretentious poses , as Frida and Agnetha and Bjorn and Benny . And the irresistible production suggests what electronic bliss might have been if ABBA had lived past disco to work with Giorgio Moroder on a good_day . 68 Madonna , &quot; I ' ll Remember. &quot; Madonna -- seditionist , or shill ? During her appearance with David Letterman a_few weeks back , on her worst behavior , she played the rebel and gave her host a rough time for &quot; kissing ass &quot; with his guests nowadays . So whose butt is she smooching , then , when she lip-syncs an earnestly dull movie theme ballad in front of film_clips from a Joe Pesci vehicle , of all things ? Her own , maybe , since it was her production company that made &quot; With Honors , &quot; the movie being promoted ? She ' s made a career out of her good cop / bad cop routine , playing the pop public like a violin , with a good , rhythmic sense for how to alternate her provocative and populist strains -- until lately . On the Letterman show , Madonna played the bad lieutenant to the childish hilt ; in this clip , she ' s sweet and clean as a whistle , if still on the take . After the &quot; Late Show &quot; debacle , America may be finding the split-personality shtick just a little harder to reconcile . 38 Guns N ' Roses , &quot; Since I Don ' t Have You. &quot; Amid many straight liaisons involving the band members , Axl Rose has two model chicks getting extremely chummy in GNR ' s latest overheated , over-budgeted , typically nonsensical video . So , we suppose , he ' s come a long way since the ballyhooed alleged homophobia of a couple albums back , but does his fondness for lipstick lesbians make him the Roseanne Arnold or the Bob Guccione Sr . of MTV ? Only his newsstand_operator knows for_sure . 30 Motley Crue , &quot; Hooligan ' s Holiday. &quot; The new , improved , in-Vince-ible Crue is taking itself awfully seriously these days . Either they or director Nick Egan have a bad case of Bono envy , as evidenced by this video , which heavily echoes the deliberately confusing &quot; cut-up &quot; style of U2 ' s future-shock-embracing tour and videos . The Motley variation of &quot; Zoo TV &quot; is just Boob TV ; as affectations go , they should ' ve stopped at hair_spray . Who should feel most ripped_off by this silly jumble : Stanley Kubrick ( band members dress_up as Malcolm McDowell ' s white-clad &quot; Clockwork Orange &quot; gang ) , visual artist John Baldessari ( red stripes with printed slogans like &quot; Control Your Enemies &quot; and &quot; Destroy Political Correctness &quot; appear on screen ) , or U2 ' s tour designers ? Even hooligans , it turns_out , get highfalutin . 20 Enigma , &quot; Return to Innocence. &quot; Clearly Enigma was aiming for a return to Fort Knox with this latest mutt-like , multicultural blend of throb-rock and pre-pop archaism , now playing_at middlebrow homes throughout the Hamptons . Meanwhile , director Julien Temple , who ought to know better , ends_up running his reels of childhood-lost scenarios backward in an unfortunate bout of video literalism . Innocence never felt more cynical . 19 Chris Willman ' s Sound &amp; Vision column appears periodically in Calendar .</TEXT>
