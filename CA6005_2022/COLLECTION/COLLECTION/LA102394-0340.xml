   <HEADLINE> DESPITE CRACKDOWN , DRUG ' CAT ' IS SPREADING ACROSS MIDWEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For five years now , in apartments and college dormitories , in the back seats of cars , in hunting cabins nestled in the birch and maple stands of the north woods , the drug methcathinone has been cooking throughout Michigan ' s Upper Peninsula . &quot; Cat , &quot; as it is commonly called , is a chemical cousin of both methamphetamine and the Somali khat plant and is easy to make from readily available ingredients that range from paint thinner to lye . It is cheap . It is powerful , pleasurable and intensely habit-forming . It is dangerous , leading to paranoia , extreme weight loss , bloody noses and loss of sleep . After the seizure of 34 cat labs , authorities here say they believe that they are slowing an epidemic of abuse that has overwhelmed emergency_rooms and addiction centers_on this isthmus dividing Lake_Michigan and Lake_Superior . Yet despite -- or perhaps because of -- the crackdown here in cat ' s cradle , the drug is now spreading through the Midwest and beyond . The recipe has been passed along from friend to friend , sold for thousands of dollars , published in a book and distributed on the Internet computer_network . There have been other so-called designer_drugs in the past , but law_enforcement officials find cat especially worrisome because it is so simple to put_together and so similar to methamphetamine and cocaine in its effects . &quot; This is nasty stuff , &quot; said Phil Streicher , a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigator based here . Another 31 clandestine labs in nine other states have now been closed_down , with the largest_number clustered in Indiana and Wisconsin . The drug has made scattered appearances as far afield as Washington state , Colorado , Montana , Idaho and Virginia . In nearly every case , the suspects have ties to the Upper Peninsula . But last week federal_agents discovered a cat lab in Wichita , Kan. , when they raided a house where they thought methamphetamine was being made . The resident drug-maker learned the recipe from a book that can be ordered through a post_office box_in Washington state . The formula is also reaching a potential audience of millions through the Internet . The recipe has been distributed via computer for more_than a year , and there is a clear demand for it . E-mail queries were posted last week . &quot; BE CAREFUL , &quot; warned one anonymous computer_file containing detailed cat-making instructions . &quot; Don ' t introduce this stuff to kids or sell it , or I will personally hunt you down. &quot; The federal_government plans to place controls on the sale of ephedrine , a key ingredient in both cat and methamphetamine . Effective Nov . 10 , sellers of ephedrine in chemical form will be required to register with the DEA and record buyers ' names_and_addresses . Sales of ephedrine tablets , marketed as a diet aid and stimulant and available by mail-order , at truck_stops and at health_food stores , are expected to face similar restrictions by early next year . But even that change may_not pose an obstacle to cat ' s spread . Ephedrine will be more difficult to get , but it will not be banned . It is being smuggled across the Mexican border as well . And an Internet message advises that an over-the-counter cold medicine containing a related chemical is one potential alternative ephedrine source . A DEA pharmacologist confirmed the tip ' s accuracy . Although the DEA in theory could place controls on such medicines , &quot; it would be difficult , &quot; said Gene R . Haislip , the agency ' s deputy assistant administrator . &quot; I don ' t look_forward to having to do it. &quot; Cat is widely abused in Russia , where it is known as &quot; jeff , &quot; &quot; mulka &quot; or &quot; ephedrone. &quot; But its emergence as a recreational drug in the United States apparently began with a pharmaceutical company employee who was ordered to destroy old batches of substances that never were marketed , according to John Boyer , a DEA intelligence_analyst based in Detroit . One of the substances was methcathinone , which was considered for production in the 1950s to treat depression but was shelved because of its severe side_effects . But in 1989 the employee allegedly brought the stuff to parties with friends from the University of Michigan . They figured_out how to duplicate cat . The drug didn ' t catch_on in Ann Arbor . &quot; It would be hard to go_to classes on cat , &quot; Boyer theorized . But one of the students , Philip Pavlik , dropped_out and moved home to Marquette , a college town on Lake_Superior ' s shores with a population of about 22 # 000 people . He already had been giving cat samples to his younger brother , Andrew , who shared it with his friends . Together , the Pavliks started throwing cat parties . &quot; They have no idea and will not accept what a Pandora ' s box they opened , &quot; Streicher said . Dean Grimes , who was a tavern cook , had known the Pavliks in high_school . Soon he was an assistant during cat-making sessions . Grimes had cheated his way through high_school chemistry , but he learned the cat process well enough to start hosting parties in his own apartment . And so cat spread . In a region rife_with unemployment and boredom , there were plenty of people anxious to try something cheap and new . &quot; It fit culturally too , &quot; said Don Simila , an addiction counselor at the Marquette Medical Clinic . &quot; We can vegetables , can fish , shoot deer . We don ' t rely_on outsiders . Here was a drug we could make_for ourselves. &quot; Then too , in the beginning , everyone thought that cat was legal . Indeed , there were no state laws against the drug . But federal law prohibits the manufacture of substances similar to illegal drugs that are used for similar effects . So when Michigan State Police began picking_up cat , they called_in the DEA and the U.S. attorney ' s office . The Pavliks were arrested in 1991 . So was Grimes . He learned something else in the detox tank at the Marquette County Jail : &quot; I hadn ' t known that I was hooked . I felt_like I had a temperature of 1 million degrees . I could hardly breathe . My whole body ached. &quot; The night after his release , he was snorting cat again . By the following summer , cat cases were showing_up in the emergency_room at Marquette General Hospital . A report in the Annals of Emergency Medicine describes four cases in a five-month period . Among them : A 19-year-old honor student with slurred speech , tremors , hallucinations and paranoia was brought_in by his mother . He had just smoked cat for the first time . And a 34-year-old teacher injected cat repeatedly over four days ; she lay on the floor for three hours one night because she thought police were outside and would shoot her . She spent three days in the hospital . At the time , emergency_room physician T . Scott Emerson could find no medical literature on cat . He ended_up telephoning Russian doctors for guidance on how to treat this new flurry of patients . When Grimes was arrested a second time , he weighed a skeletal 131 pounds , though he stands 6-foot-1 . His perspiration smelled like model-airplane glue . Blood oozed from his nostrils and ears . Now 24 , he was sentenced to six months of home detention and is_on probation . He has gained 39 pounds and has gone_back to school . In all , 58 people have either pleaded guilty or been convicted in cat-lab cases in the Upper Peninsula . A group arrested in August near the Wisconsin border was brewing the drug for much more_than personal consumption . Indeed , Streicher said , its members had subcontracted out some of their business . Manufacture of cat by non-users has been the authorities ' greatest fear : An investment of $ 56 could yield $ 1 # 900 worth of the drug for_sale . But there is hope here that the worst is over . Both Pavlik brothers are in jail . Some of the later sentences for cat manufacturing were as harsh as 18 years in prison . The most recent arrests -- last week -- were for cat-making two years ago . Many cat processors known to authorities have fled the state . &quot; It ' s somebody else ' s problem now , &quot; Streicher said . Indeed it is . Last year , Upper Peninsula emigrants were arrested in distant places . A cat lab exploded in Craig , Colo. ; the manufacturer was from the U.P. , as the region is known . Of three people arrested for making cat in Mundelein , Ill. , two were &quot; Yoopers. &quot; &quot; It is causing concern , &quot; said DEA pharmacologist James Tolliver , who has monitored the drug since it first drew notice . &quot; We are seeing it slowly move_out . We have not been able to stamp it out_in Michigan . Missouri has had a low level of activity for some time now and we simply haven ' t been able to get_rid_of it. &quot; And those are just the cat labs that have been uncovered . Tolliver said he finds the Internet traffic about the drug &quot; quite troublesome . Who knows how many labs are out there right now ? &quot; Just three months ago , a discussion group on the Internet was offered a memo titled &quot; Tips for CAT Synthesis. &quot; It offered extra help for those who might make mistakes following the original recipe that was making the rounds . &quot; You should be able to have success ! &quot; the author wrote , signing_off as &quot; The Anonymous Chemist. &quot; Times researcher John Beckham contributed to this story from Chicago .</TEXT>
