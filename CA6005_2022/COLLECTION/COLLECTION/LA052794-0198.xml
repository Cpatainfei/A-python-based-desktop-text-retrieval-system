   <HEADLINE> 3 O.C. PARKS INCLUDED IN HAZARD LIST ; SAFETY : GROUP SAYS PLAYGROUNDS CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN . STUDY CITES 46 FACILITIES IN STATE CONTAIN RISKS THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California playgrounds can be hazardous to children , according to activists who claimed on Thursday that virtually all_the playgrounds checked , including three in Orange County posed some kind of threat . At a San Francisco news_conference , the California Public Interest Research group said that a study revealed that 46 playgrounds around the state contained hazards that should be corrected . In Orange County , the group cited Allen Park in Fountain Valley and Orchard Park and Northwood Community Park in Irvine . The study said that the Orange County parks had inadequate surfacing and &quot; fall zones &quot; to prevent injury from playground equipment . In addition , the Irvine parks had playground equipment that allowed children ' s heads to be trapped . Patricia Fierro , Irvine ' s manager for community services who oversees park planning and maintenance , said the report came as a surprise and that the city had never been contacted by the research group . &quot; We ' ve worked real hard to make_sure our playgrounds are safe , &quot; Fierro said . &quot; We ' ve won numerous awards. &quot; The city also has &quot; followed safety guidelines by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , &quot; she said . Orchard Park was developed following all existing guidelines , Fierro said . Northwood Community Park &quot; was built much earlier in the city ' s history , &quot; she said , &quot; at a time when we were permitting our architects to have a little more creative opportunities in the development of playground equipment . Now we purchase ( equipment ) out of catalogues. &quot; At Northwood , known to children as ' Castle Park , ' and other , older parks , &quot; we have made modifications for safety , &quot; Fierro said . &quot; We try to minimize the dangers. &quot; Laura McGourty of the research group said , &quot; Public playgrounds can be wonderful places for children to have fun and face new challenges , but far too many playgrounds contain hidden hazards that can injure and even kill. &quot; The investigation hit on hazards that cause the most serious playground injuries : falls , impact with moving swings , and head entrapment . Protective surfacing under and around all play equipment is the most critical factor , McGourty told reporters . All but two of the 46 playgrounds investigated lack adequate protective surfacing . Wood chips , sand , any loose fill is good , providing it ' s between nine and 12 inches deep , she said . Rubber mats take impact well , McGourty said , adding that they have another plus . Broken glass , used syringes and other items that became buried in sand can be spotted on the mats . &quot; We don ' t want parents to be paranoid about bringing their children to the playgrounds , &quot; said McGourty . &quot; We just want people to know about it and , as well , the park personnel to know that these playgrounds do have hazards that can actually injure our children. &quot;</TEXT>
