   <HEADLINE> A NATO THAT WON ' T RUFFLE RUSSIA ' S SECURITY FEATHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The level of bitter recriminations over Bosnia within the Atlantic Alliance is unparalleled since the Suez Crisis nearly four decades ago . Only this time there is no unifying threat to impose a sense of urgency to the quest_for unity . What the Bosnian failure demonstrates is not so_much the failure of the alliance as the penalty of evasion . It poses , above all , these questions : Is the alliance still important ? And , if the answer is affirmative , will it be able to generate common purposes even in the absence of a strategic threat ? The oft-invoked &quot; new_world order &quot; will only emerge , if at all , at the end of a period of instability , which is its birth pang . A vital Atlantic Alliance could play a crucial role in the resolution of its attendant crises , provided it is able to focus_on its common necessities , as it previously did on common fears . If the enlargement of democracy is to have any operational meaning , it must begin with the Atlantic Alliance . The nations of the Atlantic area need each other . Without the United States , Europe turns_into a peninsula at the tip of Eurasia , unable to find equilibrium , much less unity . Without Europe , the United States will become an island off the shores of Eurasia , condemned to a kind of pure balance-of-power politics that does not reflect its national genius . Some Europeans advocate European Union as a device to render the United States dispensable . In fact , a major U.S. role in Europe is a prerequisite for European coherence . It provides a measure of equilibrium by giving France a safety net against German hegemony and Germany an emotional harbor as European unification slows_down , as well as protection against outside dangers and excessive European nationalism . Even Russia has much to gain from a U.S. presence , which is one of the best guarantees against the re-emergence of historic European rivalries . Europe by itself cannot handle the two most dangerous Russian contingencies : resurgence of nationalism or implosion . Until recently , the Clinton_Administration has been hesitant to give Atlantic relations their traditional priority . Many of its key members , having formed their political convictions during the Vietnam protests , viewed the Cold_War as unnecessary and its institutions as potentially dangerous . Treating the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization as a relic of the Cold_War , they preferred to rely_on Russian goodwill as the key to international order . The Administration ' s new emphasis on Atlantic cooperation needs to take_account of a number of principles : * The crisis in the Atlantic Alliance can be solved only by opening a dialogue on fundamentals ; previous U.S. vacillations complicate the ability to restore confidence . But the task is not insuperable since , despite all controversies , the current NATO leaders all have a long record of friendship with the United States and , even in France , understand the need for a continued U.S. role . * The structure of U.S.-European relations needs to be modified . With the military threat receding and the risk of political crises growing , the political role of the alliance should be given greater emphasis . In the security field , autonomous European military_capabilities could prove in the common interest because they permit political flexibility in the application of Allied power . * The most sensitive immediate issue is NATO expansion , which the Administration courageously put before the recent NATO ministerial meeting . But it must take_care lest , in seeking to please every constituency and to respond to every pressure , it winds_up in the same dead_end as Bosnia . The new U.S. proposal calls_for an exploration of NATO expansion with each member of the Partnership for Peace , which is composed of all NATO members , the former Soviet satellite orbit and all_the successor states of the Soviet_Union , some 40 altogether . If this is anything other_than an opening gambit , it will lead either to stalemate or to confrontation . Russia will either veto expansion or approve it only if Russia itself becomes a member . In that case , NATO would stop being a defensive alliance and turn_into a system of general collective_security similar to the United Nations . Having started down the road of NATO expansion , the Administration must choose between the concept of the NATO Alliance , based on defining an area to be protected , and the concept behind the Partnership for Peace , designed to unite the former blocs . NATO is not the instrument to serve both purposes . Nor can the decision wait until an acute Russian threat appears . Pressures against NATO expansion will grow more insistent at that point , compounded by the fact that a skillful Russian challenge will be made to appear ambiguous . NATO expansion represents a balancing of two conflicting considerations : the fear of alienating Russia against the danger of creating a vacuum in Central Europe between Germany and Russia . A wise policy , instead of pretending that Russia has an option for NATO membership , would take two steps . It would proceed with membership for Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Hungary and reject a Russian veto . But at_the_same_time , it would propose a security treaty between the new NATO and Russia to make clear that the goal is cooperation . Such a treaty would provide that no foreign troops be stationed on the territory of new NATO members on the model on the arrangement for East_Germany ( or no closer than a fixed distance from the Poland ' s eastern border . At the same time , such a treaty could provide_for consultation between NATO and Russia on matters of common interest . In such a structure , there would be no reason for Russian security concerns . Going beyond it would grant Russia a right to create a vacuum around its borders , preserving the options of historic Russian expansionism . Failure to expand NATO in the near future is likely to prove irrevocable . Russian opposition is bound to grow as its economy gains strength ; the nations of Central Europe may drift out of their association with Europe . The end result will be the very vacuum between Germany and Russia that tempted so many previous conflicts . When NATO recoils from defining the only limits that make strategic sense , it is opting for progressive irrelevance .</TEXT>
