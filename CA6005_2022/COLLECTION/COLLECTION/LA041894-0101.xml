   <HEADLINE> CLINTON INSISTS ON DIPLOMACY AS CRITICISM RISES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As criticism of his Bosnian policy mounted Sunday , President Clinton insisted that diplomatic rather than military_actions hold the key to defusing the renewed hostilities in the war-torn nation . Speaking with reporters Sunday , Clinton said that U.N. officials in Bosnia have concluded that further NATO air strikes would be ineffective against Bosnian Serb forces besieging the Muslim enclave of Gorazde , and he stressed once more his hope of finding &quot; a negotiated agreement &quot; to the civil_war . &quot; We have a diplomatic role , and we are doing our best to fulfill it , &quot; Clinton said during a trip to Virginia and North Carolina . But even as the President spoke , a senior official in the Bosnian government warned that any diplomatic agreement that left the Bosnian Serbs in control of conquered territory guaranteed continued hostilities . &quot; You have to reverse the results of ' ethnic cleansing ' if you want a stable peace , &quot; Bosnian Vice_President Ejup Ganic said on ABC ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley. &quot; That stark warning came as calls mounted for the United States and its North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization allies to take firmer military_action in response to the Bosnian Serb attacks over the last week on Gorazde . Clinton and NATO have struggled to deter the renewed Serbian attacks without widening Western participation in the civil_war or provoking an open break_with Russia , which has generally supported Serbia and resisted military_action . On Sunday , Clinton said the United States will respond to requests for additional military responses from U.N. commanders on the ground but added that the principal goal was &quot; getting these peace talks back on track. &quot; Clinton said the Administration had indicated a willingness to discuss with Russia the lifting of U.N. economic sanctions against Serbia as a way of stimulating the stalled peace talks but that the recent Bosnian Serb offensive has taken that option off the table . &quot; Continued Serb aggression on the ground , not only in Gorazde but everywhere else , is hardly an encouragement to discuss that , &quot; he said . &quot; We can ' t even begin discussions in the environment which has existed for the last few days there. &quot; Clinton also said he had spoken Sunday with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin but offered no details about the conversation . Taken together , these statements suggest that the Administration remains committed to holding_the_line on its policy of using the minimum amount of force necessary to spur negotiations . But an array of senators and two former Republican secretaries_of_state insisted Sunday that the policy had demonstrably failed . &quot; If we had planned it , I don ' t see how we could have gotten_into a worse mess than we are now in , &quot; Lawrence S . Eagleburger , secretary_of_state under former President George_Bush , said on CBS ' &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; But , in a revealing display of the difficult choices facing Clinton , Eagleburger and the other critics diverged dramatically in their assessments of what the Administration should do next . In talk-show appearances , Sens . Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) , Orrin G . Hatch ( R-Utah ) and John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) all called_on Clinton to urge the United Nations to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims -- or to unilaterally ship arms to the Muslims if peace talks remain stalled . Biden , appearing on &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; said that &quot; if the Serbs don ' t move_over the next month &quot; the United Nations should remove its peacekeeping troops from Bosnia and arm the Muslims and Croats to escalate their operations against the Bosnian Serbs . &quot; Let ' s supply them with weapons and let them go_after the Serbs , &quot; Biden said . &quot; Let ' em fight , because that ' s the only way you ' re going to . . . end_up with a genuine settlement on the ground , when the Serbs . . . understand nothing more can be gained by the use of force. &quot; On the same program , Hatch echoed Biden ' s call_for lifting the arms embargo and said the move should be reinforced with &quot; surgical air strikes &quot; to knock_out Bosnian Serb &quot; fuel supplies , their transportation lines , their ordnance depots , their ammunition dumps. &quot; But other officials warned of expanding U.S. involvement or otherwise widening the war . House Foreign Affairs Chairman Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) criticized calls_for a unilateral U.S. end to the arms embargo , saying such a move would &quot; Americanize the entire war. &quot; &quot; I still do not think we should enter this war on the side of the Bosnian Muslims , &quot; he cautioned . Former Secretary_of_State Henry Kissinger suggested that events had rendered the anguished U.S. debate over how to proceed in Bosnia largely irrelevant . &quot; I think the Serbs already have almost everything they want , and we are now engaging in a sort of a symbolic tit_for_tat in the closing phases of an operation that is more or less concluded , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
