   <HEADLINE> WILANDER HAS NIGHT ON TOWN ; TENNIS : FORMER SWEDISH STAR DEFEATS HORST SKOFF , 6-4 , 6-4 , IN FIRST ROUND OF AT INDIAN WELLS TOURNAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fittingly , they let an elder_statesman do the honors on the first-ever evening session at the Newsweek Champions Cup here Monday . Such an occasion demanded a quality master of ceremonies , and Mats Wilander handled the duties like the star he is . Make that was . Wilander , once the greatest in the game and now , at 29 , still an occasional force to be reckoned with , properly christened night tennis in the desert with a 6-4 , 6-4 victory over Austrian Horst Skoff . The evening session drew 5 # 471 , and combined with the 9 # 090 that came for the regular day session gave the tournament a total of 14 # 561 , its biggest single-day attendance . Because this is the first time organizers have had split sessions here , each day through Friday is likely to top that mark , with Saturday and Sunday day-only sessions limited to the 10 # 500 stadium capacity level . The 14 # 561 total compares well with early-week attendance draws for the U.S. Open , which are usually in the low 20 # 000 range . No . 82 Skoff had to play through a qualifying tournament to get_into the main draw here . But he also is a tour veteran , who once defeated Wilander in a 6-hour 3-minute Davis Cup match in 1989 . If anything , Wilander probably would have been considered the underdog . He is ranked No . 231 in the world now . The five players ranked directly above him are Oliver Gross , Chris Pridham , Louis Gloria , Miguel Pastura and Simon Touzil . Last week , in a first-round match at Scottsdale , Ariz. , the kind of tour stop that Wilander used to zip through , he lost to somebody named Grant Stafford . But Wilander ' s participation on the ATP Tour is not one of those pathetic tales of athlete-hangs-on-too-long . He has won seven Grand_Slams , as_many as Pete Sampras and Jim Courier combined . But his quest is not particularly for an eighth , nor for a return to the No . 1 spot that he held for much of 1988 and ' 89 . &quot; I play now to play , not just to win , &quot; he said . &quot; To be No . 1 or 2 , you have to compete , to play to win . There ' s no other way you can do_it , no other way you can feel about it. &quot; Nor is it that Wilander is coming_out occasionally on the tour , grabbing wild cards into tournaments and simply taking_up space . He enjoys winning , enjoyed his victory over Skoff . But he also knows he has been there , didn ' t like it enough to keep fighting for it , and now looks_upon his days of glamour and glory with perspective . &quot; After 1988 , I just didn ' t care anymore , &quot; he said . &quot; I never really decided that I was going_to quit playing forever . I just decided that it wasn ' t as important anymore . I ' ve got a great family , and I know what I ' ve done before . &quot; The main reason I ' m playing now is for the days when it feels good , when I can put the ball on the racket in just the right spot , and when I can hit the ball to within a square_foot of exactly where I want it . I play for those days when it still feels perfect , when there is a sense of mastery and I ' m able to control it nearly to 100 % . &quot; Wilander acknowledged that he had less than 100 % control against Skoff . After breaking Skoff at 4-5 of the first set with a nice slice backhand approach and a crisp forehand volley , then running_off to a 3-0 lead in the second set , Wilander tightened . Serving for the match at 5-3 , he let Skoff attack too_much and ended_up losing his serve . But Skoff returned the favor with a less-than-sparkling service game of_his_own , flapping a loose forehand wide on match_point . &quot; I just tightened when I was serving for the match , &quot; Wilander said . &quot; It ' s not that often that I am in that situation these days . It doesn ' t matter how many years you ' ve done_it , if you are playing all_the time , it is routine . If you aren ' t , it is not. &quot; And if that means not winning , Wilander has a pet phrase for it . &quot; Life goes_on , &quot; he says . Notes Cedric Pioline of France , last year ' s runner-up to Pete Sampras in the U.S. Open and the ninth-seeded player here , went_out unceremoniously in the first round . He lost to Jonathan Stark , the former Stanford star , 6-4 , 6-3 , and looked listless in doing so . The two had played once before in a tournament final in Bolzano , Italy , last year , and Stark won that one in straight sets , too -- his only tour title to date . Pioline , who has not played particularly well since his two-week run at Flushing Meadows , said there wasn ' t much he could do because Stark hit it as hard as he could every time and approached the net . Pioline countered with a slowball serve that Stark labeled &quot; a lollipop. &quot; Spain .</TEXT>
