   <HEADLINE> BOUTROS-GHALI SHIFTS BLAME OVER BOSNIA ; BALKANS : THE U.N. CHIEF POINTS TO NATO ' S AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES AS THE SOURCE OF HESITATION . HE SAYS HE can ' t SIMPLY ORDER AIR STRIKES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , in a rare news_conference , insisted Tuesday that NATO -- and not the United Nations -- is at the core of the hesitation over using punitive and strategic air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina . With this assertion , the secretary_general sought to shake himself free_of what he believes is a false image of him as the main obstacle to the use of air_power in the Bosnian conflict . Boutros-Ghali said officials of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization had informed him that their planes were authorized only to provide &quot; air support &quot; -- immediate measures in defense of U.N. peacekeepers under_attack in Bosnia . The planes , Boutros-Ghali continued , were not yet authorized by the NATO council to engage in &quot; air strikes &quot; -- strategic measures such_as the bombing of a bridge or an airport and punitive measures such_as the bombing of troops several days after they had attacked U.N. peacekeepers . In line with this , Boutros-Ghali last week gave his special representative in Bosnia , Yasushi Akashi of Japan , authority to call_on NATO for air support should U.N. peacekeepers fall_under attack during the weeks ahead while trying to relieve Canadian troops now trapped in Srebrenica and open the airport now besieged in Tuzla . But the secretary_general said that , although a Security_Council resolution gave him the mandate to call_for both NATO air support and NATO air strikes , it would do him no good to call_for the latter . &quot; I am not at the end of the chain of command , &quot; he said . On the_matter of air strikes , that falls on the North_American and West European governments that make_up NATO . &quot; So even if you will ask tomorrow ( of ) NATO , please do an air strike , they will have to take a decision which will have to be adopted by the council of NATO , and , as you know , the council of NATO takes a decision by unanimity , &quot; the secretary_general said . Boutros-Ghali , a former Egyptian diplomat and professor of international_law , does not like to meet formally with the U.N. press corps . His news_conference was the first at U.N. headquarters in more_than a year and only the third since he took_office in January , 1992 . In the 45-minute session , dominated by questions about Bosnia , he also : * Announced his opposition to the lifting of the embargo that prevents the Bosnian Muslims from buying weapons on the world market . * Confirmed that Croatian soldiers had crossed the border into Bosnia . * Made a plea for continued negotiations for a peaceful settlement even while hinting that the major_powers would have to come_up with a new approach to the Bosnian war . * Predicted that countries like the United States , now wary of peacekeeping operations , would someday embrace the idea that these are the world ' s best means of maintaining peace and security . On the issue of the arms embargo , Boutros-Ghali put himself squarely against the Clinton_Administration , which has advocated lifting it to help the Bosnian Muslims defend themselves . The secretary_general called this &quot; a negative approach. &quot; &quot; If you ask my personal advice , &quot; he went_on , &quot; I believe that this can be dangerous because it will provide more arms in the region and it may open_to a real war in the region. &quot; Boutros-Ghali said that , though it is rarely mentioned , a major aim of the international community was to &quot; contain the dispute inside the border of ( the former federation of ) Yugoslavia &quot; and &quot; avoid a war in all_the region. &quot; Discussing the Croatian incursions into Bosnia , the secretary_general said he did not yet know whether the soldiers were regular Croatian troops or &quot; volunteers. &quot; In any case , he made_it clear he was disturbed by their arrival , adding that it would be up_to the Security_Council to decide what to do about this new development in the war . The secretary_general , without giving any details , hinted several times that moves were afoot to develop a new approach to Bosnian peace negotiations . &quot; Certainly in the next few weeks we will have to have a general reassessment of the situation , because many member states are thinking to withdraw their troops from Bosnia , &quot; he said . But the secretary_general emphasized there was little choice beyond a slow negotiating process . Although many U.N. officials have been infuriated by President Clinton ' s decision to withdraw all American troops from Somalia by the end of March , Boutros-Ghali painted the new reluctance of Clinton to take_part in peacekeeping operations as a universal problem . &quot; This is not peculiar to the United States , &quot; he said . &quot; Many other countries have the same problem . They are hesitating . Why must I send my kids to be killed for a peacekeeping operation in a very difficult place ( when ) my public_opinion won ' t accept this . &quot; Our role is to convince them that it is in their . . . national interests to participate in these kind of operations , that . . . in the next few years we may have more and more ethnic wars and more and more small confrontations . These confrontations can spread like a disease all_over the world. &quot;</TEXT>
