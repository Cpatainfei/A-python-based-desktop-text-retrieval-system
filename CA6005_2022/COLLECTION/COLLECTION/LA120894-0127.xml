   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE / COVER STORY ; A CLASSIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The box_office is barely the size of a broom_closet , the screen curtain is torn and stained , and the battered orange seats make a high_school auditorium look fashionable . Even the snack_counter sells nothing more exotic than popcorn and Raisinets . At the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles , patrons forsake creature comforts for the sake of cinema . Probably the foremost theater in Southern California devoted to first-run art films , old-movie revivals and documentaries , the Nuart has carved out its own niche in the annals of theater exhibition . It has given important early bookings to a host of young directors who went_on to greater glory -- John Waters , David Lynch and Jane Campion , to name a_few . Waters ' &quot; Pink Flamingos &quot; and Lynch ' s &quot; Eraserhead , &quot; two ' 70s films now considered classics , each received important early exposure at Nuart midnight screenings , which attract a colorful mix of_aging hippies , tweedy cineastes , leather-clad punkers and others . Yet as the Nuart marks its 20th anniversary under the same management , the venerable movie_house finds itself at a crossroads . Landmark Theater Corp. , co-founded in 1974 to operate the Nuart , was acquired in 1991 by the Samuel Goldwyn Co. , which has since embarked_on an aggressive national expansion . Based in West Los Angeles , Landmark now runs 120 screens in 16 cities , employs 1 # 000 people nationwide and is building new multiscreen theaters in San Francisco , Minneapolis and Boston . The company also operates two other Westside first-run specialty houses , the Pavilion in Rancho Park and the NuWilshire in Santa Monica . Industry experts say the so-called multiplexes , along with the rise of home video , have gone_a_long_way toward making single-screen theaters like the Nuart all but obsolete . But Landmark insists its 550-seat flagship theater on Santa Monica Boulevard can thrive in the changing marketplace . &quot; No one builds single-screen theaters anymore , &quot; concedes Landmark President Steve Gilula . But , he adds , &quot; the Nuart is a unique institution. &quot; The Nuart owes its singularity , in part , to the rise of independent films in the last decade or so . This has given art cinemas plenty of new movies -- allowing the Nuart , for instance , to offer such sleeper hits as Campion ' s &quot; Sweetie &quot; and Gus Van Sant ' s &quot; Drugstore Cowboy. &quot; But at_the_same_time , the availability of old movies on video and cable TV has made_it harder for theaters that show classics to attract audiences . So the Nuart , like a handful of other art theaters nationwide , has survived with a crazy_quilt of offerings -- some old movies , some new , some totally obscure . The eclectic mix is reflected in the four-color calendar that the theater publishes every three months , replete with boxes of blurbs and photo cutouts . The Nuart ' s programming has slowly evolved since the mid-1970s , when Gilula and partners Gary Meyer and Kim Jorgensen took_over the theater and devoted it almost entirely to revivals of old movies . Such theaters were called &quot; grindhouses &quot; because they showed a different double-feature bill every night . Previously , the Nuart had , like many art cinemas , fallen on hard_times . Built during the 1920s , the theater played studio pictures that had just finished six or eight weeks in the plush movie palaces along Hollywood Boulevard . Then , during the ' 50s and ' 60s , the Nuart began riding a wave of high-brow foreign films by Ingmar Bergman and others . But by the late 1960s , U.S. studios had begun making_bolder , more artistically challenging pictures that competed favorably with the foreign films . Movies such_as &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; and &quot; The Godfather &quot; sold_out at neighborhood theaters that were previously not known for showing cutting-edge cinema . The Nuart and many other art cinemas survived by showing racy potboilers and , later , soft-core pornography . &quot; If you ' re a theater operator , you ' ve got_to keep the doors open , &quot; Meyer said . &quot; They found_out sex was selling and subtitles weren ' t. &quot; Gilula , now 44 , and Meyer , 46 , were both fresh out of college when they met in the film-buying department at United Artists Theaters in San Francisco during the early 1970s . After a brief period working for a small film company , Gilula in 1974 teamed_up with Jorgensen to run the Nuart . Meyer became involved in programming the UC Theater in Berkeley , which was another early Landmark property . Meyer handled film bookings from his native San Francisco as Gilula managed Landmark ' s growth from Los Angeles . During the mid-1970s , the chain more_than doubled its number of screens ( from four to 10 ) , using internal cash flow and financing from a concessionaire . In the early 1980s , Landmark -- so named because many of its theaters were in historic buildings -- merged with Movie Inc. , a New Mexico-based exhibitor that ran about 13 single-screen theaters in the Southwest . Even as the company grew , Gilula kept the atmosphere relaxed . &quot; No one in our office wears a suit and a tie , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re high-energy and intense but very casual about the environment. &quot; Meyer spent much of his time screening new movies and traveling_to film festivals . But he and the other principals realized that a slate of old movies wasn ' t enough for a single screen like the Nuart . They needed a gimmick . So , in addition to reviving movies ranging from &quot; Casablanca &quot; to &quot; A Clockwork Orange , &quot; the Nuart -- like some_other art theaters around the country -- began offering midnight screenings of fringe cinema , including films by Waters , Lynch and others . Soon midnight movies became a cultural phenomenon from coast to coast . Fans of &quot; The Rocky Horror Picture_Show &quot; packed screenings at which they sang , danced and wore outrageous costumes inspired by the comic musical . The events became more live theater than cinema -- and remain so to this day . &quot; It was an occasion for the audience to identify itself , to cluster around a particular movie , &quot; said Jim Hoberman , film critic of the Village Voice and co-author of the book &quot; Midnight Movies. &quot; &quot; Often these were films regarded_as outre , and in midnight screenings they could be released without the typical procedures of reviews and conventional release patterns , &quot; Hoberman said . &quot; The films could catch_on and be an in-group kind of thing. &quot; Theaters in New York were the first to show Waters ' &quot; Pink Flamingos &quot; and Lynch ' s &quot; Eraserhead , &quot; but both directors credit the Nuart for giving their careers an early boost in the film capital of the world . &quot; The Nuart ran ' Pink Flamingos ' for 10 years , for heaven ' s sake . Talk_about good legs , &quot; Waters said in a telephone_interview . &quot; It ' s still a theater ( where ) I go_to to see a film . . . . It always had the films that took the most chances. &quot; Sometimes these runs led to special relationships between certain directors and the Nuart . For instance , Waters made a short film for the Nuart about 10 years ago that was soon picked_up by other theaters nationwide . The film showed the director smoking a cigarette and reminding audiences that the law prohibited smoking in a public theater . &quot; But don ' t you wish you had a cigarette now ? &quot; Waters asked viewers . &quot; Go_ahead and smoke . It gives ushers jobs. &quot; By then , many viewers had begun watching old movies on VCR and cable and stopped going_to revival houses . Over the past dozen years , the number of Landmark screens devoted solely to old movies has dwindled , from almost two_dozen to about four or five . Meyer and Gilula ( Jorgensen left the company in 1982 ) began mixing more first-run foreign and independent movies into the Nuart ' s revival programming . They scored some big successes with Wim Wenders ' &quot; Wings of Desire &quot; and the director ' s cut of &quot; Blade Runner , &quot; among others . The merger with Goldwyn three years ago benefited both parties . To expand , Landmark needed capital that could be provided by a large , publicly traded company . Goldwyn , meanwhile , was interested in acquiring the theater chain to help diversify its holdings beyond TV , and movie production and distribution . Meyer Gottlieb , president and chief operating officer of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. , said that the audience for specialized movies such_as those shown at the Nuart is the fastest-growing segment of the market , accounting_for almost 20 % of the $ 5-billion annual box_office ticket sales in the United States . Goldwyn has so far resisted the temptation to turn the Nuart into a reconstituted movie palace . Unlike the El Capitan or Chinese theaters in Hollywood , the Nuart has no grand rococo details or stately lobbies . Instead of classical or easy-listening music before the feature , the speakers pipe out be-bop jazz . But Nuart patrons come for the movies , not the ambience . &quot; It ' s certainly not the most comfortable theater in the world , but that ' s a small price to pay_for what they show , &quot; said Jonathan Benair , a Los Angeles screenwriter who has frequented the Nuart for years . Meyer said that Landmark prefers to spend money on upgrading sound and projection equipment rather than interior_design , but he added that a new curtain is_on order . The theater ' s main marketing tool remains the calendar , which is distributed in the lobby and at area coffeehouses and bookstores . The current issue advertises a December run of &quot; Red , &quot; the final segment in a trilogy by Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski , and a special series of old noir films in February . And there ' s a Betty Page look-alike contest on Jan . 6 , at a midnight screening of some rare burlesque reels featuring the famous ' 40s and ' 50s pinup . The eclectic approach has captured a broad cross-section of film-goers . Benair said he often sees the seats fill_up with hard-core movie buffs he calls &quot; film geeks. &quot; But he said the theater also attracts large_numbers of teen-age punks , college kids , music fans , and gays and lesbians , many of whom are drawn by special series . Despite the theater ' s obvious following , though , some wonder how much longer the Nuart and other single-screen theaters can survive . Single screens &quot; are the dinosaurs of exhibition , &quot; said Bob Laemmle , owner of the Laemmle Theatres , a chain that competes with Landmark for bookings and viewers . Two years ago , Laemmle opened the Sunset 5 , an art cinema multiplex in West Hollywood that has successfully combined first-run art movies at night and classic revivals on weekend mornings . &quot; You really need to spread costs over a multiple number of screens to continue to function , &quot; Laemmle said . Gilula admits that a multiplex has certain advantages over the Nuart . Meyer , who still does most of the theater ' s booking , has very little margin of error because a flop movie cannot close before the ending date posted in the calendar . Sometimes distributors want their pictures to have time to develop an audience instead of being locked into a fixed run . Sometimes audiences just aren ' t interested in certain pictures . Gilula explained the disappointing results of one special series this year by noting , &quot; I ' m not sure people wanted to see films about human rights. &quot; But Gilula says that , despite the odds , the Nuart has stayed profitable and grown_into a cultural institution with formidable staying power . &quot; The theater really has its own reputation , &quot; he said . &quot; It provides an outlet for films people could see nowhere else . It ' s raised the consciousness and broadened the taste of a whole generation of filmgoers. &quot;</TEXT>
