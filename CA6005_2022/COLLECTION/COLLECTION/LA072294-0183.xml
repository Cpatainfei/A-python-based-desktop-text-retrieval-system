   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; A REVEALING ' SHE ' S GOTTA HAVE IT ' ON LASER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sex and cinema may have gone together from the beginning , but few filmmakers have been able to deal honestly with women ' s sexuality . And until Spike Lee burst_upon the scene some eight years ago with &quot; She ' s Gotta Have It , &quot; none had even acknowledged African American sexuality , let alone the black female libido . With the brashness , inventiveness and sheer determination of a young artist sure of his craft but short of cash , Lee put a personal stamp on his picture that announced the arrival of a filmmaker to be reckoned with . Criterion ' s valuable unrated director ' s cut ( $ 50 ) of Lee ' s first commercial venture clearly shows why the film caused a sensation at Cannes ' Directors Fortnight and the San Francisco Film Festival . The rich transfer of cinematographer Ernest Dickerson ' s black-and-white photography ( and one color scene ) was made from a 35mm fine-grain master , the original 35mm magnetic audio master and a 35mm print . &quot; The best thing about ' She ' s Gotta Have It ' is that it put me on the map and enabled me to make other films , &quot; Lee says on a second audio track , which also includes commentary from Dickerson , sound designer Barry Brown and production supervisor Monty Ross . &quot; We never go_back and look_at our films , &quot; Lee explains . &quot; It ' s hard for me to look_at them and see what I wanted to do and wasn ' t able to achieve. &quot; What he was able to achieve on an initial shooting budget of $ 18 # 000 is a lyrical , slightly raw slice of life in the Brooklyn neighborhood in which he grew_up , shot on the fly in 12 days . He and Dickerson call it &quot; guerrilla filmmaking. &quot; &quot; It was like visual jazz , &quot; Dickerson says , &quot; improvised within a structure . A style comes_out of limitations . When you are doing_it , you don ' t think_about style , but the quickest , most efficient way to get a scene done . The style comes later. &quot; From the beginning , Lee made_good use of his talented family , starting with the evocative jazz score written and conducted by his father , Bill Lee , and framed by spare black-and-white stills &quot; raided &quot; from his brother David Lee ' s &quot; blossoming art portfolio. &quot; Shelton J . Lee was producer . Tracy Camilla Johns , who stars as the unashamedly sexual Nola Darling , was discovered after she sent a photo in the mail . Spike ' s sister Joie Lee played Clorinda Bradford ; Bill Lee played Sonny Darling , and the piano on screen . When another actor bailed_out , Lee took_on the role of Mars Blackmon ( &quot; I know him better than anyone else &quot; ) , a character whose &quot; Please , please , please baby , please baby baby , please &quot; took_on a life of its own , the rhythm of the words exploited in later Nike ads with Michael Jordan . The sensual , even shocking , bedroom material , deleted to avoid an X rating , is included here . &quot; When the decision came_down ( to delete the offending material ) , I thought it was racist , &quot; Lee recalls . Since the film was being released by independent Island Pictures , &quot; they didn ' t have the firepower that the major studios have . They can change an X into an R , &quot; he suggests . The film , which ultimately cost $ 175 # 000 , including post-production , brought_in an estimated $ 8 million , and Lee , at the helm of a new_wave of adventurous , visionary black filmmakers , went_on to make &quot; School Daze , &quot; &quot; Jungle Fever &quot; and &quot; Malcolm X , &quot; all stamped with his unique perspective . But none have the freshness , even sweetness , of &quot; She ' s Gotta Have It , &quot; raw filmmaking at its best , captured beautifully in this handsome laser disc produced by Donna Michele Edge and Mary G . Pratt and executive produced by Peter Becker . Also included in the package is the imaginative original theatrical trailer , the film ' s music video , a deleted scene ( &quot; Clorinda moves_out &quot; ) , David Lee ' s unit photography work with his audio commentary , plus those jumping Nike ads and other supplementary material .
