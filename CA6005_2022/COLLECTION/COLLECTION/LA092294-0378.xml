   <HEADLINE> MARKETS ; SHOPPING FOR SOBA , SUSHI AND SHABU-SHABU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bottleneck of cars jockeying for position in the parking_lot at Marukai Discount Japanese Food Mart is the only sign of life on this desolate stretch of Vermont Avenue in Gardena . Tucked between an empty phone switching station and the flashy El Dorado gambling_casino , Marukai sells bonsai gardening tools , wind chimes , fresh soba noodles , beautiful sashimi trays , instant matsutake mushroom soup , hand-carved wooden rice bowls , red-bean flavored ice_cream bars and rubber Japanese garden slippers . It ' s not fancy here . The aisles are tight and the floor is concrete . But shelves are packed with a treasure_trove of edible discoveries -- many of them selected and imported directly from Japan by Marukai Inc. You ' ll see the Marukai brand name on several styles of green_tea , bamboo_shoot tips and tempura mix , among other things . Cooks who use Japanese ingredients , whether for authentic dishes or fusion cooking , love Marukai for its serendipitous selection of unusual brands . The store is_well organized , but there are always a_few randomly placed boxes of Japanese mayonnaise in squeezable plastic bottles or bubble_gum wrapped with Japanese cartoon characters . A tiny Seiko watch department sits next to rare brandies and futons opposite the Japanese pharmacy items . &quot; The idea for Marukai grew out of necessity , &quot; says Art Noda , a close associate of Marukai owner Hidejiro Matsu . Marukai Inc. started_out as a distributor of Japanese giftware , with locations in New York , Cerritos and Northern California . But the economic downturn of the late ' 70s put these novelties at the bottom of shoppers ' lists . * Matsu , who was already well connected in the Japanese wholesale food business in Hawaii and Osaka ( where his family had a food distribution company ) , reasoned correctly that a discount membership grocery and housewares store would fit the revised spending habits of local Japanese consumers . So in 1982 Matsu opened Marukai on 166th Street across from the Gardena Buddhist Church . Patrons paid a $ 4 membership fee and were sent a monthly newsletter offering special deals on Japanese merchandise . In those days , discount merchandising was unfamiliar to Japanese businessmen , and Marukai seemed like a bold idea . &quot; Matsu is a creative risk_taker , &quot; says Noda . The risk clearly paid_off , for Marukai soon needed to expand into its present , much larger location on Vermont . Recently other Japanese stores have begun to compete with Marukai ' s low-price deals , so I can ' t promise you won ' t find similar prices elsewhere . But Matsu is thinking ahead and he has changed his strategy once again . The desire for excellent service , he feels , is making a comeback among his customers . His service-oriented &quot; New Marukai , &quot; presently under construction , promises to be as imaginative as his discount merchandising in the early ' 80s . In addition to such conveniences as dry_cleaners , mailing service center and shops such_as a florist , and a food court , New Marukai will display cultural exhibits from the various provinces of Japan . The displays will give customers the opportunity to educate themselves about such traditional things as kimonos , regional porcelain and Buddhist altar goods . Cultural programs and cooking classes are also scheduled . New Marukai will also have a recycling center and offer environmentally-friendly products such_as organic produce and household cleaning agents . A philosophy has evolved here , one of &quot; using business to bring the old and new together to help the 21st century work for our children , &quot; says a blurb for New Marukai . That will be another story . Shopping List SUSHI MADE EASY Watching a skilled itame-san working behind a restaurant sushi counter can easily intimidate a non-Japanese cook . But making sushi at_home really isn ' t an impossible task . Almost everyone in Japan can make several kinds of home-style sushi . The easiest version , chirashi sushi , is simply a bowl of sushi meshi ( rice prepared_for sushi ) tossed together salad-style with finely cut fish and other ingredients . Some chirashi have one or more kinds of sashimi with garnishes and pickles arranged on top of the rice . The second easiest home-style sushi , hako-zushi , is made by pressing the rice and fish or other topping into variously shaped molds called kata . The finished sushi is simply unmolded . There ' s also inari-zushi . For this style you buy deep-fried tofu squares called abura-age from the tofu section . When thin slices of tofu are deep-fried , they puff_up , leaving a pita-bread-like hollow to be filled with plain sushi meshi or rice mixed with chopped vegetables or smoked salmon . Marukai has everything you need for these sushi styles . * Sushi Rice Flavoring ( Sushinoko ) : Preparing sushi meshi , the vinegared rice for sushi , can be a difficult chore because there is no single recipe to guide the cook . If the rice is very moist you need less vinegar than for drier rice , and if you need less vinegar you need less sweetener , and so on . Sushinoko eliminates those problems . Simply sprinkle a 75-gram bag of this powdered , seasoned and sweetened vinegar over four cups of cooked short-grain rice and mix well . * Rice Cookers : For perfect rice , all you really must know is how to turn_on a rice cooker . You ' ll rarely see such a vast selection of these gadgets in one place as at Marukai . They range from one cup to 10 cups in capacity . And some brands offer deluxe models that can be programmed to turn_on and off at any hour automatically . * Sushi Forms : Marukai has dozens of forms to make sushi . Some are plastic , others wood . They turn_out thick or thin sushi rolls , triangles and various kinds of layered sushi . Most have &quot; international &quot; labels with easy-to-follow pictographic directions . * Prepared Wasabi : The Japanese horseradish , wasabi , is said to stimulate the taste buds and digestive_juices . It is fabulous when freshly grated . But fresh wasabi is difficult to get , even in Japan . Most restaurants end_up mixing the powdered , dehydrated wasabi with water to get that familiar smooth green paste . Now wasabi comes_in the slightly better form of toothpaste-type tubes . You don ' t have to mix , and the tube ejects only as much wasabi as you need . Look_for several brands of wasabi in tubes against the north wall of the store . * Sushi Fixings : Marukai imports canned Sushi Mix under its own label . The seasoned , assorted vegetables and tofu that make_up the mix are often used for vegetarian sushi or futomaki , a thick roll of rice wrapped in roasted sushi nori . * Canned Quail Eggs ( which for some inexplicable reason are in the canned fruit section ) make a charming garnish for chirashi , or they may be used at the center of a sushi roll . Marukai ' s fish department is , naturally enough , another good source of sushi materials . * NOODLES , RICE AND MORE * Soba : Japan ' s famous buckwheat noodles may be humble or luxurious . Buckwheat was once the grain of poor farmers who couldn ' t afford , and often weren ' t allowed , to eat rice . Now in some parts of Japan soba has become a status food , requiring hand-milled , specially grown buckwheat , purified water and noodle-making masters with years of training . The soba selection at Marukai boggles the mind . Start in the cooler section , where there is plain fresh soba ( made in L.A. ' s Little Tokyo ) or fresh Japanese-made soba with soup packets to which you need only add water . Then move_on to the dry noodle section . There you find plain soba of varied lengths and thicknesses . The various brands of cha soba contain powdered green_tea . The yamaimo sobas are made with a little mountain yam ( yamaimo ) that gives the noodles a slight springiness . Among the regional soba styles is wanko soba , unusual for its short ( barely four inches ) lengths . Kirishina soba , a thin but irregularly shaped noodle with a rustic quality , is reminiscent_of noodles handmade in the countryside . * Soba Tsuyu : So what do you do with soba ? You eat it with garnishes and soba tsuyu , a soup-like mixture of fish-stock , soy_sauce and either mirin or sugar . Serve cooked fresh soba chilled on a mat and accompany it with a bowl of the tsuyu , a small mound of thinly sliced scallions and a little wasabi . To eat the noodles , pick them up with chopsticks or a fork , swish them in the sauce and quickly down them ( the sauce doesn ' t cling for very long ) . The tsuyu may also be heated and the noodles served in this broth topped with steamed vegetables , tsuyu- seasoned chicken chunks or beef . Tsuyus have recently come_on the market in concentrated form . Kikkoman ' s Nemmi sauce is one such example . Tsuyus are also available in a fully prepared form called &quot; straight type. &quot; In addition to soba tsuyu there are udon tsuyu and somen tsuyu ( made with a thin wheat noodle ) . Each is appropriately seasoned for its particular noodle . Some brands of tsuyu are made without MSG . * Soba Konnyaku : Chewy and mint-green colored , these precooked strands are not soba but a condiment for it . Konnyaku , colloquially known as devil ' s tongue jelly , is a firm , gelatinous substance made from a starchy root . It also comes_in blocks that are cut_into shapes and simmered in soupy broths or stews . Soba konnyaku , meanwhile , is eaten chilled with soba tsuyu . Marukai imports its own brand of soba konnyaku . A woman demonstrating the product told me it was delicious cut_into short lengths and made into a salad with lettuce , crab ( or imitation crab ) and a Japanese salad_dressing . * Shirataki : Another noodle-like form of konnyaku , shirataki , is also known as white waterfall for its glassy , shimmery appearance . Shirataki is popular as a sukiyaki ingredient because it soaks_up the flavorful broth . * Truly Instant Rice : Rice , the absolute essential part of most meals , is usually cooked by the gallon in most Japanese homes . But for the couple or lone diner in a hurry , packaged cooked rice is the ultimate Japanese emergency food . It can be stored unrefrigerated . Simply boil the unopened pouch for about 10 minutes or heat in a microwave for two minutes . * SEASONINGS AND FLAVORINGS * Kasu : Officially called sake lees , this fermented mash of rice is what remains after sake is made . Kasu tastes very much like sake , and like sake , it is said to remove the fishy smell from fish and to tenderize foods . There ' s a marinade for fish called kasuzuke ( roughly , &quot; soaked lees &quot; ) . Kasu looks_like uncooked oat bran in cream , and it ' s a rather odd sight to see slices of cod or salmon ( which you find in the fish department ) marinated in it . There is also something called itah kasu that is firmer , like a raw dough . Plain kasu in plastic bags is stored in the cooler with the miso . * Mirin : It ' s been said that at the heart of Japanese cooking is the trio of dashi ( fish stock ) , soy_sauce and mirin ; they are used together in everything from soups and cooking broths to noodle dipping sauces . Occasionally labeled in English as sweet rice wine , mirin is almost syrup-like , with an exceptionally low alcohol content . In cooking you must never substitute sake for mirin but rather use plain sugar . Mirin is especially pleasing when boiled and reduced to a viscous syrup , seasoned with soy_sauce and used as a glaze for grilled foods . * Sukiyaki Sauce Base : Sukiyaki , which means &quot; plowshare-grilled , &quot; got its name from the time Buddhist laws forbade eating meat . Hungry peasants , when lucky enough to find game , would grill it in the fields right on their plowshares . It was reasoned that if you didn ' t take the game home to cook , then it would n ' t count as an official meal and you were not violating any precepts . Beef , a relatively new food in Japanese cuisine , has become the star of sukiyaki , but the dish is also made with all sorts of other foods . Shirataki and tofu are popular ingredients because they soak_up sukiyaki ' s delicious sauce . One of the most popular sukiyaki dishes , udon suki , is made with seafood ( obviously not found in the farmer ' s fields ) and thick wheat noodles . But sukiyaki is simply grilled meat ( or chicken or fish ) to which you add a sauce and then vegetables . If sukiyaki is prepared at the table , diners often cook their own vegetables a_few at a time in the broth . Marukai sells a sauce concentrate that you simply pour onto the meat after it is grilled and then add vegetables . * Shabu-Shabu Dipping Sauces : Shabu-shabu is another cooked-at-the-table beef dish like sukiyaki , and is likewise new_to Japanese food . It ' s supposedly named after the sound made when the beef gets swished-swished through bubbling water as diners cook it in their table-top hot pot . Cooked like this , the beef and ensuing vegetables are pretty bland , but several delicious dipping sauces are usually served alongside to season them . Marukai stocks two of these sauces . The first , with a sesame paste base , is rich and creamy with the slight tang of vinegar and garlic . The second is soy sauce-based and spiked with mirin , lemon_juice and rice vinegar . Look_for these at the back of the store with all_the other sauces . * Umeboshi : Somehow the Japanese palate is in_love with the excruciatingly sour taste of umeboshi , the pickled green plums that make your hair stand on end . There is even an umeboshi -flavored chewing_gum for those who want more_than a quick hit of sourness . Salt and red_amaranth leaves flavor and add color to umeboshi , which are regarded_as a digestive aid , a breath freshener and an eye_opener at breakfast ( which they surely are ) . Marukai has many brands of umeboshi : tiny ones the size of peanuts and others slightly smaller than a prune . Some are flavored with dried bonito fish . Some umeboshi are packed in globe-like jars with a drape of cellophane under their lids that is designed to resemble a cloth or towel . The packaging is meant to evoke the old-fashioned pickling jars that people used when they made their own umeboshi at_home . In pureed form , strained to remove the plum skins , umeboshi are used to season sauces . Occasionally , you ' ll find a sushi recipe that calls_for umeboshi puree ( also called bainiku ) . * Demi-Cured Pickles : Kyuri usujio ichiyazuke -- literally lightly salted cucumber , pickled one night -- is the half-cured dill of the Japanese pickle world . Most non-Japanese find these extremely pleasant because they ' re not as salty and strong as other Japanese pickles . Look_for them in the pickle cooler near the fish department . * The following recipe is excerpted from &quot; Northwest the Beautiful , &quot; edited by Kathy Casey ( Collins Publishers : 1993 ) . SAKE KASU COD 1 1 / 2 cups kasu ( sake lees ) 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 1 tablespoon light-brown sugar , packed 3 tablespoons sake 3 tablespoons mirin 1 1 / 2 teaspoons salt 4 ( 6-ounce ) fillets black cod , skin on 2 tablespoons oil In bowl mix together kasu , sugars , sake , mirin and salt . Spread half marinade in bottom of non-aluminum baking dish . Lay fish over , then spread remaining marinade over fish . Cover with plastic_wrap . Refrigerate 48 to 72 hours . Prepare fire in charcoal grill . Remove fish from refrigerator 30 minutes before grilling . Wipe all marinade off prior to cooking , or let some marinade remain . Brush fish pieces with oil . Grill flesh-side down 5 inches from medium-hot coals 4 to 5 minutes , then turn and cook skin-side down about 2 to 3 minutes more . Both sides of fish should be slightly charred and flesh should be opaque throughout . Makes 4 servings . * Marukai Market , 15725 S . Vermont Ave . ( south of Redondo Beach Boulevard ) , Gardena .
