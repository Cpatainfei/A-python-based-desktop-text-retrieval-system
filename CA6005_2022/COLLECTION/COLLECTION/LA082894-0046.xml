   <HEADLINE> SERIOUS FUN ; ANNA SUI ' S QUIRKY DESIGNS COME OF AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anna Sui ' s gleeful eye sees poetry where fashion conformists see only the absurd . She trims her glittery disco dresses with garters and drapes fake fox stoles -- heads attached -- around the shoulders of serious supermodels . Smile , her clothes say , it ' s only fashion . After a decade of anonymity , Sui grabbed the fashion world ' s attention a_few years ago with her resurrection of hippie chic , a potent marriage of bohemia and psychedelia that appealed_to the theatrical sensibilities of both New York ' s downtown crowd and Hollywood ' s young and hip . Her quirky designs have evolved since then but remain part of fashion ' s vanguard . Today , Sui sells to more_than 200 stores in the United States , Japan , Europe and Canada . And in what is surely the sincerest form of flattery , her work is copied by rivals . A souffle- sized faux fur_hat that prompted giggles when Sui friend and longtime client Linda Evangelista wore it during the designer ' s collection debut in 1991 has turned_up on competitors ' runways . And earlier this year , an Italian designer was accused of duplicating Sui designs , stitch for stitch . Sui ' s taste for eccentricity or romance or whatever you call her free-form aesthetic places the thirtysomething designer squarely opposite someone like Giorgio Armani , for whom less is more . For Anna Sui , more is more better . She tops a Norwegian sweater with a Norwegian cardigan , teams them with a fake fur skirt , patterned hose , a neon-green marabou scarf and a big hat to match . Oh , did we mention the teetering , five-buckle pumps ? Woven through her work are references_to favorite design motifs of the past -- Chanel suits , ' 50s-style jackets , Eva Gabor ' s peignoir in &quot; Green Acres. &quot; The designer attributes her tendency toward postmodernist sampling to a childhood spent poring over fashion magazines . As a Chinese-American teen in Detroit , she would meticulously match her shoes and purse to her dress , an effort that earned her the title Best Dressed Eighth-Grader . But her creative mettle wasn ' t truly tested until , while studying at Parsons School of Design in New York , she helped classmate Steven Meisel style photo shoots_for an Italian fashion magazine . &quot; They would send us skiwear , and we would turn it into hippies on motorcycles , adding fur vests and tapestry boots in much the same way as I do now when putting_together a collection , &quot; she says . Sui ' s fall collection is a generational leap from her signature look from spring , the baby-doll dress . The innocent girl in the patent-leather Mary Janes has grown_up and would rather wear flouncy cheerleaders skirts , rubber rompers over neon-bright spandex T ' s and black vinyl pants . Sui credits the groundbreaking ' 70s fashion photography by Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton for inspiring the edgy glamour in her latest designs . &quot; I love all that glamour , &quot; she says . And so , she suspects , do the young_women who came_of_age in the time of grunge . Push-up bras , corsets , garter_belts , stiletto_heels -- &quot; for this younger generation , it ' s like playing dress-up , &quot; she says . Her own personal style is defined by a_few rituals from which she never varies : &quot; I always wear Chanel Midnight Red lipstick and nail_polish &quot; -- and a discontinued but treasured blush called Orange Flame . Her penchant for color extends_to her New York apartment , where floors and ceiling are vivid red and where , up until a_few years ago , Sui did her designing . &quot; I would love to do everything -- shoes , jewelry , lingerie , &quot; Sui confesss . &quot; I ' ve been talking to people about a perfume . I wish I had more money so I could do more. &quot; Until then , she ' s busy in her Garment Center studio , plotting the direction of her next collection . Possible influences include her recent travels through Europe ( &quot; I love the eccentric way people in London dress &quot; ) and the shopping habits of her West Coast clientele ( &quot; A halter dress we did for spring just flew out of the store -- it showed a lot of skin &quot; ) . &quot; Having a store in L.A. , &quot; says Sui of her year-old La Brea Avenue boutique , &quot; has really opened my eyes . It got me thinking_about non-seasonal design and more casual clothes. &quot; What also struck Sui was how close to the bone women here keep themselves . &quot; Everyone is a size 2 or 4 . I remember seeing women and wondering how old are they ? &quot; * Produced and styled by Michael Eisenhower</TEXT>
