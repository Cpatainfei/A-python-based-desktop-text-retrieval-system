   <TEXT> My daughter Katie gripped the controls in gloved hands and , with a cold rain spitting in our face , we soared above the gray wintry tableau of Euro Disneyland on -- what else ? -- Dumbo the Flying Elephant . Down below , families in matching yellow Disney rain ponchos ( $ 4.50 at shops everywhere ) gamely strolled through the puddles . Cheerful Christmas music , and the scent of popping corn and baking cookies , wafted up from Main_Street U.S.A. And , through the mist , we could see Le Chateau de la Belle au Bois Dormant , or Sleeping_Beauty ' s castle . And wasn ' t that the Evil Queen from Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains , Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , watching us from one of the balconies ? Hearing my 5-year-old ' s delighted giggles , as Dumbo leaped up and down at her touch , I had to admit we were having fun . Dressed in corduroy pants , woolen hats , heavy coats and rain gear , to be sure . But having a good time , just the same . Later , climbing onto a docked pirate_ship , and probably speeding from infusions of chocolate and sugar , Katie said : &quot; People like Disney , don ' t they , Dad ? &quot; Indeed , they do . Of course , I didn ' t have the heart to tell her that Michael D . Eisner , chairman of the Walt Disney Co. , had only a_few days earlier said Euro Disneyland might close unless European banks agreed to restructure its $ 3.7 billion in loans . Disney has agreed to keep its European subsidiary , which owns 49 % of the shares , afloat for three months . And Eisner is playing the kind of economic hardball that a youngster probably would n ' t appreciate . But the paradox of Euro Disney is that the park itself , from Thunder Mountain to Star Tours , and the Mad Hatter ' s Tea Cups to the Pirates of the Caribbean , has been a success , by almost anyone ' s measure . More_than 18 million visitors have spun through the turnstiles since the opening in April , 1992 , making_it the single largest tourist attraction in France , far surpassing even the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre . &quot; People in Europe said it would n ' t work . They said this wasn ' t Florida . They said it was too cold . But , in fact , it works , &quot; said Jean-Marie Gerbeaux , Euro Disney ' s vice_president of communications . &quot; That was the first big challenge -- to demonstrate that we could draw people . And that ' s been very important to us. &quot; Even Le Monde , the influential daily newspaper , admitted recently that &quot; we ( French ) had rather taunted this improbable transplant &quot; of American popular culture , calling it a &quot; cultural Chernobyl &quot; and a &quot; conservatory of nothingness. &quot; &quot; Euro Disney provoked from the beginning a reflex of rejection among the intellectuals , &quot; the paper noted . &quot; And then , with time , even the most hostile have accepted it. &quot; Accepted it , in large part , because it boosted the region ' s beleaguered economy . Euro Disney has generated tax_revenue and paychecks in abundance -- 8 # 500 new permanent jobs and 46 # 000 other jobs linked to Disney ' s existence . In fact , Euro Disney is responsible_for half the new jobs created in France since its opening . So what ' s the problem ? Well , the economic recession in Europe has brought France 12 % unemployment and hurt tourism everywhere . The 5 # 500 rooms in Disney ' s six hotels had an average occupancy_rate of 55 % last year , well below the company ' s expectations . Then a weak real_estate market thwarted Disney ' s plans to begin selling_off some of its hotels last year . Euro Disney suffered an operating loss of $ 300 million last year and took an additional $ 600 million one-time loss for staff cuts and pre-opening expenses . It is in debt up_to Mickey ' s ears and can ' t make its loan payments . Now 60 creditor banks are trying to decide what to do . Katie and I had waited and waited for a sunny day to make the first of what would be two visits to Euro Disney . When the sun appeared on New Year ' s Day , we bundled_up against the 42-degree temperatures and boarded the train , which takes 40 minutes from downtown Paris to the park in the eastern suburbs . We paid the high-season rates that apply over the Christmas holidays -- about $ 45 for adults and $ 30 for children -- and joined more_than 30 # 000 other &quot; guests , &quot; as Disney calls us . We wandered through the park , which is laid_out along the same lines as its older sibling in Anaheim , with wedges of the circular pie devoted to Discoveryland , Fantasyland , Adventureland , Frontierland and Main_Street U.S.A.. Our first stop was for chocolate_chip_cookies at the Main_Street deli , a personal favorite of Katie ' s homesick Mom and Dad . Then we headed for Katie ' s favorite attractions , remembered from her last visit to California ' s Disneyland . &quot; It ' s a Small World , &quot; sponsored here by the_French state telephone_company , was Katie ' s first choice , followed closely by Alice ' s tea cups and flying Dumbo . The lines were fairly long , with waits ranging from half an hour to 90 minutes at the Big Thunder Mountain roller_coaster . The dozens of shops selling Disney goods were clogged with browsers , but there were no lines at the cash_registers . Sticker shock is probably the biggest complaint about Euro Disney , which has been troubled by lower-than-expected spending inside the park . We found the prices were steep , due in large part to a strong French_franc , with stuffed animals beginning at about $ 30 . We dropped $ 60 for two skull-and-crossbones pirate hats , a plastic dagger and a pirate pistol for Katie and her younger brother . Then we went_in search of lunch . Several of the restaurants were closed so we chose a Tex-Mex joint , Fuente del Oro Restaurante . I was disappointed to see the restaurant ' s fajita bar closed and no evidence of the advertised &quot; live mariachi music. &quot; &quot; This chili is really good ! &quot; Katie said . It had better be , I responded , at $ 6.50 for a tiny bowl . We ended our first day in the park by watching &quot; C ' est Magique , &quot; a live musical program , with young dancers and all_the Disney characters switching easily from English to French and back again . A few days later , we were back , this time in a driving , cold rain . Only a_few thousand hardy souls joined us . Gone were the long lines . Gone , too , was much of the sparkle . This was a weekday in January , the start of the low season , and the winter rates were reduced to $ 30 per adult and $ 22 per child . ( Seasonal fares , a first for Disney , were introduced last fall to cope_with what Disney officials call &quot; high seasonality , &quot; a euphemism for cruddy winter weather. ) Katie took_in the Aladdin parade down Main_Street , with Aladdin and Jasmine waving from beneath an umbrella . An assortment of characters , from Mickey and Minnie to Tweedledum and Tweedledee , prowled the park ' s covered areas in what seemed to me to be a desperate search for children to amuse . In the empty lobby of the Disneyland Hotel , Minnie Mouse used me as a shield to play hide and seek with Katie for nearly 10 minutes , until I finally escaped . Gerbeaux met us there to talk_about the park ' s successes and failures , the latter of which have become daily fare for the_French press . ( Philippe Bourguignon , the Frenchman who took_over as chairman of Euro Disney last April , isn ' t doing interviews during the financial talks. ) Euro Disney has shelved the original grand plans for a second-stage expansion , and it cut 950 mostly administrative jobs last month . But construction is still under way in the park , and several new attractions will be added this summer . The company is hoping for an increase in visitors when a new Euro Disney station for France ' s high-speed train line is opened in May , cutting travel_times to the park from all_over continental Europe . The opening of the Channel_Tunnel later this year will cut the trip from London to the park to just three hours . In the meantime , Disney &quot; imagineers &quot; have been tinkering with the park , conducting thousands of exit interviews . &quot; Euro Disney has to adapt , &quot; Gerbeaux explained . Among the changes made last year was reducing the size of the four sit-down restaurants , increasing the seating at the fast-food places and adding wine -- a first for Disney -- to some menus . &quot; We thought , because we were in Paris and Europe , we needed more seated restaurants , &quot; Gerbeaux said . &quot; But , in fact , when French_people come_to the park they don ' t spend hours at lunch. &quot; As for the wine , &quot; everybody thought we added wine because of the_French , &quot; who account_for 45 % of the visitors , Gerbeaux said . &quot; In fact , it was much more the non-French Europeans . The French come for the American experience . They want to drink a Coke and eat a hamburger. &quot; Some prices also have come_down . The lowest-price meals have been cut_to about $ 8 , from $ 12 , and even a cup of coffee costs less , $ 1 instead of $ 2 . One of the park ' s six hotels now offers $ 52-a-night double rooms for a family of four during the winter . However , the premier facility , the Disneyland Hotel , still runs $ 250 a night for a family of four in the low season . Beyond that , Gerbeaux said , the chairman wants to change the Disneyland concept , to make_it , well , less American . &quot; Euro Disney should become , not French or European , but it must have its own personality , &quot; he said . &quot; Of course , we must stay very , very Disney . But we want people to feel at ease. &quot; In the lobby of the Disneyland Hotel , Katie and I found Christopher Jordan , his wife , Lulu , and their three children hiding from the rain . They had come from England for a three-day visit . &quot; The weather ? Oh that . It ' s fine , &quot; Christopher Jordan said . But he complained about the costs . &quot; We came_with money to spend , but we didn ' t spend as much as we would have because it felt_like daylight robbery , &quot; he said . &quot; Don ' t get me wrong . The place is beautiful , and we ' ve enjoyed ourselves. &quot; Of course , those price_tags don ' t mean much to children . And kids aren ' t dissuaded either by the inclement weather . For them , the Disney magic still exists in Marne-la-Vallee . At 6 p.m. , as the park closed , Katie and I left the Disneyland Hotel , rain-soaked but smiling . &quot; This was great , &quot; Katie said . &quot; You know , Dad , if we lived_in this hotel , everytime we went outside we ' d be in Disneyland. &quot;</TEXT>
