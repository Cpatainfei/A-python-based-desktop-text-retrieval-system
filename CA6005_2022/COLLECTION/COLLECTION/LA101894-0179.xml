   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; BUILDERS SEE NO CEILING ON EXPORTING TO JAPAN ; IT ' S THE MOST LUCRATIVE HOUSING MARKET IN THE WORLD , WITH 1.6 MILLION STARTS A YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s advertised as the &quot; Three-Floor Dream , &quot; and Sumitomo Ringyo Co. ' s latest model home is unquestionably a fantasy compared to the cramped abodes the Japanese normally endure . Encompassing 1 # 700 square_feet , the house boasts four bedrooms , 2 1 / 2 bathrooms , two dining_rooms and balcony space galore . But to foreign home-builders visiting here recently , it was the price_tag that seemed make-believe : $ 900 # 000 -- and that ' s not including the land . &quot; I could put that up for $ 80 # 000 , and that ' s an absolute fact , &quot; gasped Irish home builder Gerard McCaughey , his jaw literally dropping . Southern California beachfront builders would charge about $ 170 # 000 , added McCaughey , who lived and worked there as marketing director for Ireland ' s largest builder , Century Homes . Mark Hutchinson , a lumber supplier from Idaho , reckoned $ 170 # 000 would buy both the home and the land in Boise . &quot; You hear these kinds of stories and you see dollar_signs , &quot; McCaughey said . that ' s precisely the point , in the eyes of the Japanese government . Last year , the coalition government of then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced a national target to cut Japanese home prices -- now among the most expensive in the world -- by one-third by the year 2000 . Scrambling for ways to meet that goal , both government officials and private firms have launched campaigns to increase housing imports . Not only would better housing at lower prices fill the single greatest demand of Japanese consumers . It would also help shave the politically nettlesome trade imbalance between the United States and Japan , pointed_out Shusaku Hirano , who is leading the campaign for the Japan External Trade Organization . &quot; One imported housing kit costs $ 70 # 000 to $ 80 # 000 . that ' s two or three times the cost of an automobile , so it ' s worth it for us to tackle , &quot; Hirano said . * JETRO sponsored the recent visit of 60 builders , suppliers and trade promotion officials from 20 nations to study Japan ' s housing market . The organization has also erected four foreign model homes_in Yokohama , a port city 30 minutes by train from Tokyo , and formed an Import Housing Promotion Council along with other industry and government officials . In addition , the Export-Import Bank is providing low-cost loans to Japanese importers of foreign homes and building_materials . For foreign builders , the payoffs are potentially huge . Japan is the most lucrative housing market in the world , with more housing starts per year -- 1.6 million -- than the United States despite a population half the size . The market is growing by more_than 8 % a year , Hirano said . And Japanese consumers have the money to take_on mortgages . &quot; The most economically promising market in the world , bar none , for Western homes is Japan , &quot; said Don O . Carlson , editor and publisher of the Automated Builder , a building trades publication based in Carpinteria . &quot; Mexico needs 6 million homes and the Soviet_Union in excess of 12 million . But the question is , can they pay_for them ? &quot; Yet the average home here is twice as expensive as one in the United States , and the gap widens further when land is included . The cost of building_materials is boosted by an unwieldy distribution system padded with layers of brokers , complicated regulations and detailed inspection systems . Every single imported faucet , for instance , must be individually examined and approved by a committee of government and industry officials , said H . Kohda , director of Sumitomo Fudosan Home Co . In addition , high labor costs and construction techniques that Japanese builders themselves admit are relatively inefficient also boost the price . Japanese construction workers are paid about $ 220 a day , regardless of output or skill level . In the United States , pay scales are differentiated by skill , and payment by piecework -- $ 100 per door , for instance -- is common . And because all U.S. housing is built with lumber based on a 2-by-4 standard , American homes use an average of 28 types of lumber . Traditional Japanese homes , in contrast , use 150 different types of lumber , much of it requiring complicated cutwork . As a result , erecting homes takes twice as long in Japan . Training framers takes two years in the United States , compared to 10 years or longer in Japan , Hirano said . The market opportunities may sound too good to be true , and some of them are . For instance , even if U.S. housing kits are cheaper , they still have to be put_together here . That means the price advantage is all but eaten_up by Japan ' s higher costs for labor , transportation and other services . The final selling_price of_imported homes is only about 7 % lower than that of Japanese homes . Another formidable barrier is the refusal of the Japan Housing Loan Corp . to extend low-cost financing to imported homes . Still , builders here see plenty of ways to make a yen on the import boom . In contrast to U.S. cars , which are still plagued with poor reputations , the American home is idealized as bright , spacious and enviably well built . Japanese homes tend to have lower ceilings , smaller rooms and an average life span of just 20 years -- reasons why a French trade minister once derided them as &quot; rabbit_hutches , &quot; in a slur that stung the national consciousness . &quot; An American house is a dream to many Japanese , &quot; said Sumitomo ' s Kohda . The firm , whose Laguna Hills-based subsidiary has built 1 # 400 homes_in Southern California since 1972 , is sponsoring an &quot; American Fair &quot; to publicize its own drive to import housing kits and parts . * Sumitomo , fiercely competing with other Japanese builders in the race to cut housing costs , plans to increase imports of kitchen cabinets , flooring , accessories , lumber and other building_materials to 50 % of total procurement in the next few years . The firm is also planning to boost its imports of housing packages . By keeping the proportion of Japanese parts to 60 % , it will make the homes eligible for low-cost government financing , Kohda said . And Sumitomo still expects to shave its home prices by one-third . It won ' t be easy to buck the convoluted distribution system that , despite its inefficiencies , keeps scores of people employed . After the firm launched its &quot; American Fair &quot; this month , it was deluged with visits from local suppliers who feared getting bypassed if Sumitomo begins importing directly from abroad . But , amid cutthroat competition , Kohda says Sumitomo has no other choice but to eventually eliminate most middlemen . &quot; They wanted to know what our intentions were , what role they could play in our new strategy . They were filled with anxiety , &quot; Kohda said . &quot; I told them , ' We have to survive. ' &quot; Raymond Hege is also confident about Japan ' s market prospects . Sensing the housing boom when he visited Kyoto last year , the architect plunged ahead and started an export firm in April . The Los Angeles-based firm , Transpacific Housing Systems , exports housing , construction materials and such services as interior_design and project management . * A longtime student of Japan , Hege has been careful to prepare his materials in both English and Japanese , take the time to find suitable Japanese partners and offer products customized for the Japanese consumer . His homes , for instance , offer such standard Japanese features as an entryway where people can take their shoes off , rooms with bamboo &quot; tatami &quot; mats and bathrooms that separate the toilet from the bath . The homes still cost significantly more_than those Hege builds_in the United States : A home that goes_for $ 110 # 000 in Big Bear cost $ 285 # 000 to put_up in the Mount Fuji resort area of Hakone , for instance . But Hege hopes eventually to bring the costs down as he trains Japanese builders in the more efficient system of U.S. construction management . &quot; It ' s a good market for the right person , &quot; Hege said . &quot; But you have to be committed , and you have to be willing to do things in a Japanese way. &quot; HOUSE FACTS In Japan : 1 # 700 sq . ft . &quot; Three-Floor Dream &quot; with four bedrooms , two baths , two dining_rooms and a balcony costs $ 900 # 000 In Southern California : Same home , minus land , costs $ 170 # 000 In Boise , Idaho : Same home with land costs 170 # 000 In Japan : Imported house kit -- $ 70 # 000 to $ 80 # 000 ( two or three times the cost of an automobile ) In United States : Typical house uses 28 types of lumber In Japan : Typical house uses 150 types of lumber</TEXT>
