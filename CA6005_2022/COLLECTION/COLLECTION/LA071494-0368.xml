   <HEADLINE> U.S. DELEGATION COULD HELP INDIA PRESERVE TAJ MAHAL ; ENVIRONMENT : ENERGY_SECRETARY TARGETS POLLUTANTS IMPERILING THE MONUMENT AND CITIES WORLDWIDE . PRIVATE BUSINESS_DEALS OKD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Swifts flitted about the minarets Wednesday as the setting sun tinted the pale white marble of the world ' s most celebrated monument to eternal love , the Taj Mahal , a ruddy orange . For people around the globe , the architectural wonder built three centuries ago by an emperor to house the tomb of his beloved is a poem in stone to love and loss . Officials for the U.S. Department_of_Energy , however , saw another significance . &quot; The Taj is a monument to the need for sustainable energy , &quot; one said . This week , Energy_Secretary Hazel R . O ' Leary visited the Taj Mahal as she led what she called &quot; the largest business delegation ever to leave Washington , D.C. , and the first in the history of our nation to focus_on sustainable development. &quot; Its white marble surface menaced by high-level air_pollution and the gritty industrial zones that have sprouted around it , the Taj , O ' Leary said after a guided tour , now serves as a &quot; canary in a coal mine , &quot; warning the world at_large of its environmental problems . As a result of weekend talks with Kamal Nath , India ' s environmental minister , O ' Leary said India and the United States agreed to search together for cleaner energy sources that could be used in Agra , a city of more_than 1 million people , as well as other possible jobs for its populace that would cut air_pollution . &quot; If we think_about what sustainable development means , then what better focus for the world , not just our two countries , than to wrestle with the issue of how we preserve this wonderful monument , &quot; O ' Leary said as she sat on a bench in the Taj ' s quiet garden . Her visit was intended to build_on the momentum achieved by Prime_Minister P . V . Narasimha Rao ' s May 19 talks at the White_House with President Clinton . The large business contingent was proof the Americans meant to &quot; do deals , &quot; O ' Leary assured her hosts . On Wednesday , in New Delhi 120 miles north of here , U.S. business representatives signed 11 new private-sector ventures with Indian partners involving energy projects as diverse as construction of a $ 240-million , gas-fired 200 megawatt power_plant in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh ; use of sugar_cane waste to generate electricity ; transfer of U.S. coal-washing technology to treat high-ash Indian coal , and manufacture of low-cost solar_batteries in Madras to power rural telephones and lanterns . &quot; It means jobs , and high-quality jobs , for workers in the United States and India , and in the long_run , it also means an opportunity to suppress pollution throughout the world , &quot; O ' Leary said after the signing ceremony of accords she predicted would be worth &quot; hundreds of millions of dollars &quot; in new business . For India , where insufficient electricity often proves a choke point to faster or uniform development , the diverse sources of power should boost the government drive to build a more modern , prosperous economy . The Taj was built between 1631 and 1653 by the grief-stricken Mogul Emperor Shahjahan for his wife , Mumtaz Mahal . Although debate continues on just how badly the tomb has been damaged and the precise source , noxious fumes , chemical waste and thousands of vehicles plying Agra ' s overtaxed roads are blamed by many . Three hundred glass factories and foundries in this city and its environs reportedly burn more_than 10 # 000 tons of hard coke every day , releasing large quantities of sulfur_dioxide . An oil_refinery on the Delhi-Agra highway is also a major polluter . One expert at Agra University estimated that a square_inch of the Taj turns yellow every day . A survey this year by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute said that , if greater pollution abatement measures are not introduced immediately , a quarter of the Taj will be yellowed by 1997 . Cracks have also appeared in places . O ' Leary said that , although one Indo-U.S. study has been done on how to ease environmental pressures on the Taj , she and Nath agreed another was needed to coordinate plans by the state of Uttar Pradesh , where Agra is located , the ministries of environment and tourism and other agencies . &quot; After the study , we can then make a decision about funding , &quot; including from U.S. sources , O ' Leary said . Asked why American money should be spent on an Indian monument , O ' Leary said the same solutions developed to protect or restore the Taj could be used to refurbish aging U.S. cities . &quot; The U.S. taxpayer has a great_deal to do with the Taj Mahal , &quot; O ' Leary said . &quot; Things that enrich the soul , no matter where they exist , need to be preserved . Most importantly , all issues involving the environment are global issues . And in the United States , the American public clearly understands that. &quot;</TEXT>
