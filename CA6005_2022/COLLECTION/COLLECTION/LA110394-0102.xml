   <HEADLINE> DONN ARDEN , 79 , PRODUCER OF LAS VEGAS SHOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Donn Arden , who staged musical extravaganzas from Las Vegas to Paris for more_than six decades , died Wednesday at age 79 . &quot; Donn was the one who gave Las Vegas the glamour look that Vegas had , &quot; said his lifetime companion , Walter Craig . &quot; He was a much larger-than-life person. &quot; In nightclubs throughout the world , Arden incorporated into his floor_shows such events as the sinking of the Titanic , the burning of San Francisco , the crash of the Hindenburg and Samson toppling the temple . &quot; I ' m famous for beautiful girls and major disasters , &quot; Arden told Los Angeles Times columnist Joe Bell in 1988 . But when Arden tried to re-create the burning of Atlanta for the opening of the Las Vegas MGM Grand in the 1980s , the estate of &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; author Margaret Mitchell refused permission . Born in 1915 in St . Louis , Arden said he got his show_business start in his early teens , tap_dancing for quarters in local speak-easies to help support his widowed mother . By the early 1930s , Arden ' s dancing was good_enough to win a Charleston contest , along with another young St . Louis dancer named Ginger Rogers . A diminutive man , Arden added an extra &quot; n &quot; to his first_name and joined the vaudeville circuit as a solo act , ultimately adding two sets of twin sisters to his act , called &quot; Donn Arden and the Artists Models. &quot; &quot; that ' s when I first got_into the staging and choreographing , &quot; Arden said in the earlier interview . &quot; We had to change costumes and routines when we were held_over . Staying in one place felt so good that I figured , why not add 10 more girls and be a house line ? So we did that , and sometimes we ' d stay three or four years at a time at the same vaudeville house. &quot; A contemporary of Fred Astaire , Arden ' s own dance career was eclipsed by his choreography . &quot; I once had 12 shows running at_the_same_time in the U.S. , &quot; Arden said . In New York , he &quot; cornered the girl market -- before modeling came_in . I wanted ' em tall and leggy . I would n ' t hire anyone under 5-foot-9 for a dance line . If a girl was beautiful , she knew I ' d dress her better than anyone else . I ' d spend $ 50 on shoes for my girls in those Depression days. &quot; He died of emphysema at 10:30 a.m. at his Mission Viejo home . Arden will be cremated and a memorial service probably will be held_in Las Vegas , Craig said .</TEXT>
