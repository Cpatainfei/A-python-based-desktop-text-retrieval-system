   <HEADLINE> ZIMBABWE ONE OF FAMILY PLANNING ' S SUCCESS STORIES ; AFRICA : GOVERNMENT PROGRAM HAS CUT BIRTHRATE . SOON , ECONOMIC_GROWTH MAY OUTPACE POPULATION GROWTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bathed in the smoke of a cooking fire inside a thatch-topped hut , Maureen Dick chatted softly in Shona as she carefully positioned her stethoscope and checked her patient ' s blood_pressure . After a moment , she smiled . All was_well . She reached_into her bulging green satchel and handed_over a month ' s supply of birth_control_pills . Edith Mayata thanked her warmly . At 34 , she has six children and wants no more . &quot; It ' s difficult to look_after them , &quot; she said . &quot; The cost_of_living goes_up each day. &quot; Such scenes , once rare in rural Zimbabwe , are now common . The reason ? Eight hundred women like Maureen Dick , and a handful of men , pedal bicycles into the far corners of the country each day , going from village to village and hut to hut to provide contraceptives and advice . Neither dogs , lightning ( a major cause of death here ) , flat_tires nor wild animals ( another occasional threat ) stay these couriers from their appointed rounds . They reach an estimated 70 % of the population . And their impact has been dramatic . Ten years ago , Zimbabwe had one of the fastest-growing populations in sub-Saharan Africa , the region with the world ' s fastest-growing population . Today , the nation of 11 million people boasts a declining birthrate and an expanding use of modern contraceptives . Nor is Zimbabwe alone . Population experts say that family-planning programs are taking_hold in a growing number of sub-Saharan African_countries despite a grim regional backdrop of civil_war , poverty , famine and the virtual collapse of nation-states in Zaire , Somalia and Liberia . Countries such_as Zimbabwe , Kenya , Botswana and Ghana , however , have all achieved varying degrees of population_control . In the most promising places , like Zimbabwe , economic_growth may soon outpace population growth . Ultimately , that may mean improved living conditions . That promise contrasts sharply with Nigeria , which has 95 million people . With an annual growth_rate of more_than 3.1 % -- enough to double the population in about two decades -- Nigeria is in the midst of a relentless baby_boom that is exacerbating myriad social and political woes at a time when the economy has been battered by shrinking oil revenues . As a result , the continent ' s few family-planning success stories will be in the spotlight when world attention turns_to Cairo this week for the landmark International Conference on Population and Development . To be sure , Zimbabwe ' s program is far from perfect . The average family now has 5.4 children , but that ' s down from 6.7. And while the growth_rate is believed to have fallen sharply , it averaged about 3 % in the 1980s . More_than half the population is under 18 . But Dr. Alex Zinanga , executive_director of the Zimbabwe Family_Planning Council , is optimistic . He said the most recent countrywide study , in 1988 , showed that 43 % of reproductive-age women used contraceptives . &quot; that ' s far higher than for the rest of Africa , &quot; he said . He expects a survey now under way to find even higher contraceptive use . In some ways , Zimbabwe had a head_start . It has a relatively high literacy rate , especially for women ; good roads and communications , and a large , urbanized middle_class . Religious opposition has not been a major factor . But as elsewhere in Africa , Zimbabwe ' s black leaders were highly suspicious of Western-style family-planning programs after they won independence in 1980 from the white-minority regime that ran the country , formerly known as Rhodesia . &quot; They looked_at it as genocide , as a way of controlling the black population , &quot; Zinanga said . &quot; The government was very much against it at first. &quot; But President Robert Mugabe quickly realized he could not achieve his socialist aims if population growth was unchecked . Ironically , he since has dumped many of his discredited socialist policies but has kept the family-planning program . And the government support has been key . The bicycle brigade of community workers , for example , is trained and paid by the government . And the government buys its own oral_contraceptives rather than relying_on foreign donors . The program also is listed as a line_item in the national budget rather than being a stepchild of another department . Official policy includes other inducements as well . Parents get tax_deductions only for the first four children , for example . And women who work for the government are given time_off to breast-feed only the first four children . The AIDS crisis has added_to the urgency . Zimbabwe has been hit hard by the epidemic , and the family-planning program now includes a &quot; male motivation &quot; campaign to persuade men to use condoms and husbands to limit their families . &quot; It ' s recognized that reproductive decisions here are made by men , &quot; said Roxana Rogers , family-planning administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Harare , the capital . &quot; So if you just target your campaign at women , which is the natural tendency , you ' re missing the decision-makers. &quot; Religion has not affected the program . Only about 10 % of the population is Roman_Catholic , and far fewer are Muslim . Pope John Paul II visited in 1989 , but Zinanga -- who , like Mugabe , is Catholic -- said his visit had no impact on the family-planning program . &quot; Religion is not something people are crazy about , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s a lot of Catholics , after church , they go and get their tubes tied or pick_up their pills. &quot; Local Catholic leaders hope to change that . They issued a letter to clergy last week denouncing the Cairo conference as an &quot; assault on the integrity of the family &quot; and demanding that the government fight &quot; corrosive foreign influences and ideologies. &quot; But Father Oskar Wermter , spokesman for the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops ' Conference , concedes that he ' s fighting a losing battle . Birth_control &quot; has been largely accepted by large parts of the population , &quot; he said . &quot; I must be honest . It is very controversial even here within the church. &quot; Indeed , out at the dusty village of Nyamadzawo , 30 miles east of Harare , government family-planning videos are shown at St . Mary ' s , the local church . And one of the regular parishioners , Patricia Piroro , a 31-year-old mother of four , is also one of Dick ' s regular family-planning clients . On a warm and sunny afternoon last week , Piroro walked home , moving slowly and gracefully down the rutted road with a pail of water on her head and a child on her hip , to be greeted by Dick , who smiled and murmured a greeting . As usual , the examination was inside the kitchen , a traditional round house with mud-brick walls and a thatched roof . A brilliant shaft_of_light pierced the tiny window , and black cooking pots perched atop a fire in the center of the floor . The two women sat side_by_side on maize bags spread on the ground . After Dick had checked her patient ' s blood_pressure , they talked_about whether Piroro should switch from oral_contraceptives to Norplant implants or Depo Provera injections at a nearby clinic . Because her family income is less than $ 50 a month , she qualifies for free contraceptives ; others pay a token sum of 15 cents . Piroro said she still wasn ' t sure . But clutching her youngest child , a toddler with a torn shirt and runny nose , she announced a far more basic decision . &quot; I think four children is enough , &quot; she said simply .</TEXT>
