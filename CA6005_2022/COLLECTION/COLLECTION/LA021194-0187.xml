   <HEADLINE> CONGRESS TERM LIMITS SET BY INITIATIVE VOIDED ; GOVERNMENT : A FEDERAL JUDGE THROWS_OUT PART OF WASHINGTON STATE ' S LAW , SAYING SUCH CURBS WOULD REQUIRE AN AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throwing a chill over America ' s spreading voter revolt , a federal judge ruled Thursday that term limits cannot be imposed on members of Congress by way of ballot initiative . Only by changing the U.S. Constitution can terms of federal officeholders be restricted , U.S. District Judge William L . Dwyer said . His decision invalidating part of Washington state ' s term limit law was a sweet first-step victory for House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) and the system of congressional seniority . It also was a potentially ruinous setback for growing legions of discontented Americans bent_on a congressional purge . In the past three years , term limits for U.S. senators and representatives have become the national steam vent for voter frustration -- with ballot propositions passing one after another in 15 states , including California . Backers of the idea are pushing similar initiatives in eight more states this year . But Dwyer ruled that , no matter how fervent their frustration , voters cannot &quot; add substantive requirements &quot; for candidacy for federal_office beyond those written in the Constitution . Article I specifies only three such qualifications for the House of Representatives : a minimum age of 25 , citizenship for at least seven years and state residency . For the Senate : a minimum age of 30 , citizenship for at least nine years and state residency . &quot; If adopted as a complete bar to reelection , a term limit law would exclude a category of candidates qualified under Article I : those who have served for a certain time , &quot; Dwyer wrote in a 36-page summary decision . The landmark case was argued at the most fundamental level : Exactly what were the intentions of the framers of the U.S. Constitution ? To that , Dwyer answered , the founders of the nation adopted only the shortest_list of qualifications to protect the &quot; indisputable right &quot; of voters to &quot; return whom they thought proper &quot; to Congress . Dwyer noted that political fancies come and go . Today , voters want to bring fresh blood into Congress and shake_up the system of incumbency . But , the judge pointed_out , if voters were given free_rein to define the qualifications for candidacy , the winds may shift and they could decide that only candidates with prior electoral experience could run_for Congress . That would not be fair either , he said . &quot; A state may_not diminish its voters ' constitutional freedom of choice by making would-be candidates for Congress ineligible on the basis of incumbency or history of congressional service , &quot; the judge said . Whether &quot; term limits are wise or foolish &quot; was not for him to decide , Dwyer wrote , adding that Americans only have one choice if they wish to proceed : a constitutional amendment , such_as the 22nd Amendment , which limited presidents to two elected terms . Dwyer ' s ruling applies only to the state of Washington . But this case is certain to move_on toward the U.S. Supreme Court , where the nation could look_for a uniform application of constitutional doctrine . With Foley and the congressional incumbency on one side and voter majorities on the other , the stakes are too weighty for anything less : the advantage in shaping , and perhaps controlling , the U.S. Congress in the 21st Century . &quot; Terrible decision ! We ' re appealing immediately , &quot; said Chris Marks of the Washington , D.C.-based advocacy group U.S. Term Limits . Marks said he believed that Thursday ' s decision would spur grass-roots organizers to redouble their efforts on the 1994 ballot measures . In addition to the eight states where congressional term limit drives are under way , Marks said , about 600 local term limit propositions are being advanced this year . In a brief statement , Foley -- a 14-term congressman -- said : &quot; I believe that this decision provides an important framework for the resolution of one of the most important constitutional questions of the decade . &quot; My own view is that a constitutional amendment is the only way term limits can be implemented , &quot; Foley said . His attorney , Stephen Smith , said the ruling &quot; best protects the constitutional rights of all citizens. &quot; &quot; Accepting the sponsors ' arguments would have created a disastrous precedent in which many types of candidates could be barred from the ballot simply because a group of voters did not wish them to participate , &quot; Smith said . This case represented the consolidation of two suits filed against Washington state ' s 1992 term limit law -- one by the League of Women Voters and another on behalf of a suburban Seattle voter . They were soon joined by Foley , 10-term Rep . Henry J . Hyde ( R-Ill. ) and the American Civil Liberties Union . Among the lawyers representing their side was Lloyd Cutler , White_House counsel in the Jimmy_Carter Administration . Defending the statute was the state of Washington , the initiative ' s grass-roots sponsors , U.S. Term Limits and the Pacific Legal Foundation . Their defense_team included former Carter_Administration Atty . Gen . Griffin B . Bell . Dwyer ' s ruling would appear to have little consequence for term limits imposed by voters on state or local officeholders . That portion of the Washington law was not challenged . The U.S. Supreme Court already refused to hear a challenge to California ' s legislative term limits , which were passed in 1990 . The invalidated portion of Washington ' s law , similar to California ' s 1992 federal term limit proposition , would have permitted members of Congress three consecutive terms and senators two . Foley would have been allowed to serve in the House through 1998 ; then his name would have been banned from the ballot , although he could seek office as a write-in_candidate . The terms of other initiatives differ by state , but their cumulative effect -- if ultimately left standing -- would likely change the character of Congress . That was exactly the aim of term limit sponsors . In oral arguments last month , Bell put it this way : &quot; We ' re asking , what are the limits on the power of the people ? &quot; Besides Washington and California , the other states that have adopted term limits for congressional candidates are Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Florida , Michigan , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , North_Dakota , Ohio , Oregon , South_Dakota and Wyoming .
