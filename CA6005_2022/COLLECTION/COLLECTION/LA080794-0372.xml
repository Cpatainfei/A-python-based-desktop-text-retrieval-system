   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SOUTH : SOUTH-CENTRAL ; PROTESTERS WANT ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dressed in mock prison uniforms and lugging fake balls_and_chains along South Central Avenue , a teen-aged &quot; chain_gang &quot; led about 100 youths last week in a peaceful march and rally against the state &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; law . Chanting &quot; Hey , hey , ho , ho , ' three strikes ' has got_to go ! &quot; the protesters called_for the exclusion of juvenile felonies from the law , which mandates offenders with two serious or violent felonies to face 25-year to life prison sentences if convicted of a third felony . The law went_into effect in March . &quot; People who think that by building prisons ( they ) fight crime must also think that building cemeteries is necessary to fight AIDS ! &quot; shouted Tony Zepeda , an 18-year-old recent Jefferson High graduate to a crowd assembled Wednesday at the Police_Department ' s Kenyon Juvenile Justice Center . The march began at Welcome Baptist_Church at South Central Avenue and 76th Street , where the protesters warmed_up with slogans such_as &quot; Three mistakes is all it takes . . . . Three strikes , takes your life. &quot; Protesters moved_up Central Avenue passing_out flyers to residents and merchants . In a show of solidarity , passing drivers honked their horns and stopped to pick_up information . The midafternoon rally was organized by South Central Youth Empowered Thru Action , an arm of the Community Coalition for Substance_Abuse Prevention . The coalition contends that the cost to incarcerate teen-agers costs the same as sending them to an elite university . &quot; This is just one of the steps we are doing_in order to reach a full-blown educational campaign , &quot; said Karen Bass , executive_director of the substance_abuse organization , as she passed_out flyers . &quot; Because there has been horrific crime , there doesn ' t have to be sweeping social_policies , &quot; she said . &quot; There should be policy to prevent social problems . We know who is going_to jail . It isn ' t the white middle-class male . Look_at the statistics. &quot; Bass contends that the law is racist since the majority of the adults and youngsters who are convicted are black or Latino . According to 1992 California Department_of_Justice statistics , 28 % of felony charges statewide were filed against blacks and 31.6 % of blacks convicted were sent to prison . In addition , 33.8 % of felony charges were filed against Latinos , and 37.2 % of Latinos convicted went_to prison . Statewide , 34.3 % of felony charges were filed against whites , and 28.9 % of whites convicted were sent to prison . &quot; As a general rule this ( law ) impacts more minorities , &quot; said police_Officer John Harris outside the juvenile center . &quot; People are less inclined to hire minorities , so they are more apt to get_in trouble -- and subsequently they end_up in jail. &quot; Darl Corner , a 17-year-old Washington High student , said the policy affects teen-agers he knows who have been convicted of felonies : &quot; I experience a lot of crime in the community . But I get more harassment by police than by gang members walking down the street. &quot; &quot; It ' s hard living here in South-Central . Most gang-member kids come from one-parent families , whose mothers can ' t give them so_much attention. &quot; Corner said because South-Central families face so many day-to-day struggles , youths who can ' t get jobs turn_to crime . &quot; If a brother sees something he wants , he ' s going_to get_it . The homeboys want jobs , but there ' s no jobs out there. &quot; Community elders such_as the Rev . Algie F . Rousseau of the 105th St . Christian_Church in South-Central and Davis L . Rogers , president of the Watts Branch NAACP , marched alongside the black and Latino youths in support . &quot; We need people to look_at the impact , &quot; Rousseau said . &quot; In an attempt to solve the problem ( by enacting ' three strikes ' ) , we may be creating greater problems. &quot; ENRIQUE LAVIN</TEXT>
