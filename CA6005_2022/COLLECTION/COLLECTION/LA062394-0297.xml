   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : SOLAR POWER SAGA IS REALLY A TALE OF 2 STATES ; IN CALIFORNIA THE ECOLOGICALLY SOUND ENERGY ALTERNATIVE IS POPULAR AND USE IS GROWING . IN ARKANSAS , IT ' S A DIFFERENT MATTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Depending where you live , solar electricity -- the kind generated by a local company , Siemans , which produces photovoltaic panels that look_like sapphire roofing -- is either a wonderful or a terrible idea . If you live_in Ventura County and like the idea of a stable , clean industry that brings jobs to the area , solar is a good idea . If you live_in a Sacramento or Boston suburb and want bargain electricity rates from a source that doesn ' t pollute , it ' s a good idea . If you live_in our service_area and want electricity at your remote mountain cabin but don ' t want to shell_out a fortune to Southern California Edison to have a power_line installed , it ' s a good idea . But if you live_in Arkansas , well , maybe you shouldn ' t get involved with solar_energy . As reported on TV recently , it can get you in_trouble . Last year , the Benson family of Fordyce , Ark. , bought four photovoltaic panels from Real Goods of Ukiah , Calif. , which in turn had recycled the Camarillo-made panels from a decade-old demonstration project . The Bensons found the electrical output from the panels was sufficient , and decided to have the local utility company disconnect the family home from the power_grid . There ensued a protracted argument with the utility , Arkansas Power &amp; Light . According to paterfamilias Tom Benson , &quot; We ' ve been told so many times by so many of their people that solar_power doesn ' t work , can ' t work , will never work , that it ' s just a pipe dream. &quot; Benson went_ahead anyway . Since the panels had been around for so_long , Benson didn ' t expect them to be real peppy , but they were . So , by downsizing his fridge and TV_set and otherwise moderating his power appetite , he was able to run his household off the four panels . He was so pleased with his new setup that he put a sign_in his front_yard declaring the place to be &quot; The First Solar Powered Home_in Dallas County. &quot; According to broadcast reports , local hooligans tried to tear_down his sign and had to be chased off at gunpoint by Denton . And the power_company , suspecting him of getting power via an extension_cord running to the house next door , removed the neighbor ' s electric supply and the street light in front of both their houses . The neighbor , a pioneer-spirited octogenarian named Richard Denton , straightaway acquired his own set of solar_panels , according to Real Goods , and erected a sign declaring his place &quot; The Second Solar Electric House in Dallas County. &quot; The Ukiah firm shipped the neighbors a solar_powered street light -- for free . Gerald Garrison , spokesman for Arkansas Power &amp; Light , talked to me over the phone . The utility , he said , was initially concerned that the neighbors might have been violating Arkansas Public_Service Commission rules covering illegal usage of extension_cords . That is now a moot issue since the neighbors are no longer customers of Arkansas Power &amp; Light . Regarding the general matter of Arkansans who might take_up the practice of producing their own homemade electricity , in_effect making moonshine from sunshine , Garrison : &quot; Arkansas Power &amp; Light has generating capacity till ( the year ) 2000. &quot; Sixty months of juice may be good_enough for them , but representatives of the utilities in this state think we need to plan farther ahead . When I called around California I found that our local utility , Southern California Edison , is promoting the idea of installing solar rigs -- brand new Camarillo-made stuff by the way -- for customers at remote locations . Edison supplies the rig and customers pay_for it in installments . In Sacramento , people right in the middle of town have been ordering solar rigs -- also Camarillo made -- installed by their local utility , Sacramento Municipal Utilities District . These rooftop installations are powerful enough -- producing many times the kilowatts and many times the cost of the Denton family rig -- to run a home , and they have enough juice left over to sell some of it back to SMUD . It ' s part of a scheme to get SMUD to a point where it gets half its juice from renewable , non-polluting sources such_as solar , wind and geothermal by a deadline about sixty months from now . In another words , the year 2000 . The utility serving this county plans to be using 15 % to 20 % renewable energy sources by the year 2000 . The rest they will purchase on the open electrical_power market .
