   <HEADLINE> 6 GROUPS OPPOSE BOYCOTT AGAINST DISNEY , NABISCO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Six prominent Latino and labor organizations voiced opposition Friday to a planned boycott of Walt Disney Co . and RJR Nabisco over their financial_support for Gov . Pete Wilson and other pro-Proposition 187 candidates . Boycott opponents convened at the main entrance to Disneyland , where they announced they would devote their energies to promoting U.S. citizenship among Latinos rather than bad-mouthing corporate giants . Although the groups were vehemently opposed to Proposition 187 , which won by nearly a 3-2 ratio at the polls , they said a boycott could lead to more harm . &quot; This boycott is not about justice , &quot; said Michael Potts , a representative of the Orange County Building Trades Council . &quot; It ' s just a case of blind rage that will pit working people against working people. &quot; Said Angela Keefe , president of the union that represents some Disneyland and Disneyland Hotel employees : &quot; All ( the boycott ) will do is force our members -- 50 % of whom are immigrant workers -- to stay home with no wages and benefits. &quot; A day earlier , activists from grass-roots immigrants rights organizations had met at the same site to unveil their boycott plans . &quot; We are asking people not to heed the call made by small , insignificant groups and individuals that don ' t have the broad-based support of the Latino community , &quot; said Nativo V . Lopez , co-national director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional , one of the groups opposed to the boycott . &quot; In seeking to respond to Prop . 187 , organizations have to focus their attention on launching citizenship projects . . . to encourage Latinos to come_forward and adopt the United States as their permanent home , &quot; he said . The statewide ballot measure , approved overwhelmingly last month , would deny education , social_services and non-emergency health_care to illegal immigrants . A federal_court judge has temporarily blocked its implementation . Leaders of the boycott , meanwhile , said the latest developments would not alter their plans to stop buying Nabisco products or spending_money at Disney films and businesses . The immigration rights groups today plan to demonstrate outside the main gate of the theme park . &quot; We can ' t support companies that support Pete Wilson , who is the No . 1 enemy of the Latino community , &quot; said Fabian Nunez of La Alianza , a community advocacy group in Pomona . &quot; The purpose of our boycott is to send messages to businesses that Latino immigrants , through their spending power , won ' t support politicians who support racist policies . &quot; These groups saying they stand with Disney need to rethink their strategies. &quot; Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said the company , which did not take a stand on Proposition 187 , is &quot; gratified &quot; that other groups have come_to its defense . &quot; We felt the boycott was unjust because we supported both candidates running_for governor , &quot; McClintock said . &quot; We ' re very proud_of our longstanding relationship with the Hispanic_American community , and we ' ve done a lot of work to help our employees. &quot; Although Disneyland has no formal citizenship promotion programs in place , McClintock said corporate officials are discussing that possibility . In addition to Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and the building trades council , other groups opposed to the boycott are the League of United Latin_American Citizens of California , the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681 , the Orange County Central Labor Council and Los Amigos of Orange County .</TEXT>
