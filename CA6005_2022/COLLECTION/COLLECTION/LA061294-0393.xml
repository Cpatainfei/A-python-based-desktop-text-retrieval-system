   <TEXT> Brazil . The name is still spoken in tones bordering_on reverence in the soccer world . Between 1958 and ' 70 , the country ' s colors were worn by the most gifted player in the sport ' s history , the legendary Pele , as the national team won three World Cups and enchanted fans throughout the world with a style so joyous and graceful it was considered as much dance as sport : samba soccer . Brazilians called it jogo bonito , beautiful game , and they traveled_by the tens of thousands to watch it , incessantly playing their drums and maracas , waving flags and banners and wearing the same golden shirts as their heroes . Well , most of them wore the golden shirts . Some young_women , just as on the beach at Rio de Janeiro , chose not to wear shirts of any color , adding_to the carnivale atmosphere . It was difficult for fans even of the opposing team not to become swept_away in the exuberance . Even today , most soccer enthusiasts will tell you their favorite team in the World Cup is their own and that their second-favorite is Brazil . But the Brazil of today is not the Brazil that won its last world title almost a quarter-century ago and its almost mystical hold_over soccer fans is a product more of romance for days gone_by than reality . Planeloads of colorful , uninhibited Brazilian fans will still follow their team to the 1994 World Cup in the United States , and they will still turn first-round games in Palo Alto and Pontiac , Mich. , into festivals . But they know better than anyone else that to describe the play of their team as jogo bonito is no more apt than calling today ' s New York Yankees &quot; The Bronx Bombers. &quot; Brazilians prefer to blame it on Europe . In Pele ' s prime , which , not coincidentally , also was Brazil ' s soccer prime , the country ' s players remained at_home to play professionally . According to Paul Gardner ' s book , &quot; The Simplest Game , &quot; Italy ' s most fabled team , Juventus of Turin , once offered to buy Pele ' s contract from his hometown team , Santos , only to discover that Brazil ' s government had declared him a national treasure , which meant he could not be legally exported . Today , 11 of the 22 members of Brazil ' s national team , including eight of the starting 11 , have opted for more lucrative deals in Europe where , according to Brazilians , their players develop bad habits . In fact , what they develop is an understanding of the modern game , which , tedious as it is , emphasizes a more physical , defensive , counterattacking approach . When Brazil won its first title in 1958 , French goalkeeper Claude Abbes said : &quot; I would rather play against 10 Germans than one Brazilian. &quot; Now , Abbes might think he was playing against 10 Germans . Instead of hearing Sergio Mendes in their heads when they watch their team , Brazilian fans today hear Wagner . It might have an undeniable beat , but they cannot dance to it . During the 1990 World Cup , when Brazil , under Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni , played with two instead of three forwards , midfielder Dunga actually boasted : &quot; No more jogo bonito . This is the Brazil of sweat and sacrifice. &quot; It also was a Brazil that , for the third consecutive World Cup , failed to advance beyond the quarterfinals , losing in the second round to , of all teams , archrival Argentina . During that game , a Brazilian fan hoisted a banner that said : &quot; IF LAZARONI IS A COACH , I ' M THE POPE. &quot; Soon after , Lazaroni was not the coach . Enter Carlos Alberto Parreira , who will join the United States ' Bora Milutinovic as the only coach to guide three countries in the World Cup . Parreira , 51 , coached Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990 . In between , he served his first stint as the coach of his native Brazil before being fired in 1987 . When he returned , he knew all_the right things to say . &quot; The defensive football is not Brazil , &quot; he told World Soccer magazine . &quot; We want to go_back to our roots -- to the flat-back four , zonal marking and attacking football . &quot; That is how ( our players ) have played since they were boys . You cannot put Brazilian players into a ( straitjacket ) . Brazilians play best when you leave them free. &quot; Asked if the fans had pressured him into adopting that style , he said : &quot; It is not so_much pressure , but , yes , there is a feeling that that is the Brazilian way. &quot; Parreira enjoyed the good_will while it lasted because he knew it could not be saved for a rainy_day . The storm came when Brazil lost its first World Cup qualifying game ever , 2-0 to Bolivia . &quot; Parreira Goes Down in History , &quot; said the headline in one Brazilian newspaper . Brazil survived , becoming the only team to qualify for each World Cup since the first one in 1930 , but Parreira is no more popular now than Lazaroni . &quot; Thank God I have a good family and I am financially secure , &quot; he told World Soccer . &quot; Sometimes I said to myself , ' Is it really worth it ? Do I want to go_on ? ' You have to be a kind of Robocop to do this job . &quot; It got_to the point where we beat Bolivia , 6-0 , and one newspaper in Sao Paulo accused us of playing defensively. &quot; Perhaps that criticism was unfounded , but there is little question that Brazil is more cautious than Parreira intended when he accepted the job . The team again will come_to the World Cup with a two-forward attack , inciting the wrath of Pele . &quot; Individually , we have good athletes , but , as a team , we are not organized , &quot; he told a Rio newspaper , O Globo , in a thinly veiled swipe at Parreira . Parreira said beautiful soccer does not work without beautiful players . &quot; It ' s true , we lack creativity , &quot; he recently told the Associated Press . &quot; I look , but I don ' t find it . The fact is that Brazil today doesn ' t have a great No . 10 jersey any more , like a Rivelino , an Ademir da Guia or a Zico . Zico was the last . Give me one , and I ' ll put him on the team right now. &quot; For that , blame it on Rio . According to Gardner ' s book , Brazilian professional teams used to hold tryouts for boys 12 and up , who , even if they did not own soccer shoes would come_by the hundreds . &quot; Social factors have undermined that system , &quot; Gardner wrote . &quot; The breeding grounds that spawned all those kids have been eaten_up . The massive migration of people to the cities has meant much less space for kids to play_on . Heavy traffic has dealt a mortal wound to street soccer . . . . Rising standards_of_living have meant that soccer is no longer the only career option for poor boys. &quot; Few Brazilians would disagree . They see potential stars emerging , such_as 17-year-old forward Ronaldo , but not enough to replace the veterans on this World Cup team , which has an average age of 28 . There is a sense in Brazil of now or not again for a long_time . It could be now . The world press , oddsmakers from Las Vegas to London and even Coach Berti Vogts of the defending champion Germans , have made Brazil the favorite . But , pelted by runaway inflation , political scandal , high crime and the recent death of Formula One champion Ayrton Senna , a national hero , Brazilians have been through too_much to be optimistic about their soccer team . They were not encouraged by last Sunday ' s 1-1 tie against badly undermanned Canada in a friendly at Edmonton . But they are ever hopeful . As the song goes : &quot; Brazil . . . &quot; Where hearts were entertained in June , &quot; We stood beneath an amber moon , &quot; And softly murmured , ' Some day soon. ' &quot;</TEXT>
