   <HEADLINE> CLOUDED HINDSIGHT ; CROSSING THE BORDER : AN EROTIC JOURNEY , BY KIM CHERNIN ( FAWCETT / COLUMBINE : $ 22 ; 328 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the space of a_few short months in 1971 , Kim Chernin deserted her 8-year-old child and devoted husband in_order to traipse off on a foreign adventure ; she led another man on until his frustrated love for her turned him into a basket case , and she permanently disillusioned still another man , a 21-year-old Israeli soldier 10 years her junior , with whom she had a heavy affair . In those same few short months Kim Chernin ruined the marriage of a woman who had fallen_in_love with her , almost caused that woman ' s husband to commit murder because he was so distraught over their lesbian affair , then abandoned her woman lover as she had abandoned the others . Or did she ? In her autobiographical &quot; Crossing the Border : An Erotic Journey , &quot; Chernin , looking_back from the vantage_point of middle_age on events that occurred -- or perhaps did not occur -- two decades ago , explores the trickiness of memory , the unruliness of young appetites and the desire of the mature self to make_sense of and forgive one ' s often-puzzling , often-silly younger self . The young Kim Chernin she depicts is amoral , self-absorbed and outrageous in her egotism . Or is it that the 51-year-old Chernin , conquered now by the stifling , tyrannical superego she had so valiantly fought two decades ago , places the worst possible construction on the 31-year-old Kim Chernin ' s tortured struggle toward self-knowledge ? And what construction are we , the readers , to place on it ? Chernin ' s memoir begins as Kim arrives on a kibbutz near the northern border of Israel . For young American Jews , Israel in 1971 was still a country of idealism and high energy , a land that could call_forth the best in one . Has Kim come frivolously , looking_for excitement , hoping to be &quot; seized by the hair , &quot; to fall madly in_love , as Chernin of the 1990s suggests at one point ? Or has she come , as the writer speculates at another point , because , having left husband and child , she felt desperately alienated everywhere else , felt that her name was inscribed in the Book of the Dead and that only in Israel would she find redemption ? Under kibbutz rules , guests are permitted only to visit for a_few days . But the simplest kibbutz tasks , such_as washing the dishes , bring Kim unaccustomed rapture . She knows she must stay . This is not enough for the egotistical Kim , as the 1990s Chernin suggests with some degree of shamefacedness : &quot; She wanted to be loved , chosen , have rules broken for her. &quot; She did not want to be permitted to stay out of &quot; abstract justice. &quot; The reader is becoming as impatient with 31-year-old Kim as the writer is . Impatience grows . Simon , who loves her so tenderly that he cannot make_love to her , sings to her instead : &quot; I watch_over your sleep . . . my little one . . . I watch_over you. &quot; He reminds her of the husband she left back home who gave her money to travel and who is taking_care of her child . She tells Simon : &quot; You ' re wasting your time . . . . I don ' t want love . I told you a_thousand times I don ' t want love . You want me to break your heart , that ' s what you want from me. &quot; And she obliges . Simon wanders the cold fields barefooted , with a haunted look . But is it she who has destroyed him ? Or was he destroyed long before Kim crossed his path ? Dov is next . He is the handsome soldier , two-thirds her age , who , she dreams , will help her explore woman ' s &quot; preordained , capacious , multiorgasmic sexuality. &quot; He is not only willing to assist , he is crazy about her . Dov &quot; is the sort of man who loves once in his life , &quot; Kim thinks . &quot; This is the time , it won ' t happen again. &quot; Is he real or invented ? She leaves him for another lover , a woman . Or does he leave her ? For a reason as mundane as the fact that he is 21 and it is time for him to go_off to the university ? Kim ' s lesbian relationship begins while Dov is away at the university . Sena is a sabra . She has always lived_on a kibbutz and is married to a young kibbutznik and leader in the community . But she falls_in_love with Kim . Neither women has loved another woman before . Their sexual_relationship reveals to Kim the primordial experience that men have tried to keep for themselves , the return through eros to a place like that from which they first entered the world : &quot; I now can want , touch , take_to myself , the original body of love , &quot; Kim exults . So why does Kim leave this bestower of primordial bliss ? Is it because , as Kim crassly says at one point , &quot; love is not a sublime glue that sticks you forever to this one , to no other . Love is not an enduring attachment , why should it be ? &quot; Or is it because Kim realizes that Sena , having spent her entire life on kibbutzim , cannot simply go_off to a big city where they might live as lesbian lovers -- and that there is no city in the Israel of 1971 big enough for lesbians ? Kim runs_off to Scotland ; Sena returns to her husband , has a child with him , divorces , remarries , has many children and works as a kibbutz librarian . In Scotland a more mature Chernin suddenly emerges and decides that Kim is a hopeless reprobate who must be killed_off . In her place is born the Chernin who , two decades later , recollects her sins -- which may or may_not have been horrendous . But what of Kim ' s desertion of her 8-year-old daughter ? Can one forgive that ? The daughter can . Larissa is now 28 , grew_up in one piece , went_to Harvard , insists to her mother , who blames herself for the actions of that selfish Kim who never thought_of her little daughter : &quot; She must have been thinking ( of me ) . How else could she have sent you to take her place ? &quot; The daughter forgives Kim , but can Chernin ? Can we ? Her self-absorption is often boring . She makes a tedious tally of the hearts piled_up at her feet . Yet it becomes clear that her tally is born_out of a desperation to be assured that she is cherishable . She manages to force a modicum of sympathy from us , making us remember our own youthful insecurities and peccadilloes . And then there is the question , with which Chernin herself struggles , of what really happened . Was Kim so dashingly culpable in fact , or was it only in childish wishful_thinking that she was a femme_fatale ? Chernin , now a psychotherapist in Berkeley , finally looks_for Kim ' s good points , lets herself be charmed by the vitality and imagination that have disappeared in staid middle_age , and ends in a healthy reconciliation with her younger self . The reader , having not so_much emotional investment in Kim and exhausted by her tally , is somewhat less charmed .</TEXT>
