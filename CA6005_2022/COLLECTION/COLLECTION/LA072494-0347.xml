   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : BEHIND SPENDTHRIFT STATISTICS , U.S. HAS SAVING GRACES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The baleful news on retirement saving is only partly right , but nothing is more frightening in personal finance these days . The U.S. savings rate remains stuck below 4 % of disposable_income , according to Commerce_Department statistics . The rate was more_than 7 % for three decades after World_War_II and 6 % in the 1980s . The oldest baby_boomers , the roughly 30 % of the population born between 1946 and 1964 , are now 48 -- sigh -- and yet they don ' t seem to be saving heavily for retirement . Surveys by brokerage and investment_firms say that many of the 77 million baby_boomers underestimate how much money they will need for retirement . The trend is not encouraging . Most of the 1 # 400 respondents to a Fidelity Investments poll said they found that trying to save 6 % to 8 % of pretax income was boring and difficult and that they would not do_it . This is in spite of widespread worries about old-age poverty , which are fed by dire warnings that corporate pensions can no longer be counted_on and a common suspicion that Social_Security will simply run_out of money , condemning people now in their 30s to eventual penury . Fears of the future hurt the present . America ' s low savings rates is a big reason why Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan thinks the U.S. economy can ' t grow without sparking high inflation . So fears about saving indirectly cause higher interest_rates , which hobble the economy , making_it harder to save . We ' re in a vicious_circle . Yet most fears are overblown . To begin with , there is more saving than statistics indicate . The Commerce_Department ' s figures are overly simplistic . They take after-tax personal_income of all Americans , $ 4.81 trillion , subtract total personal spending , $ 4.62 trillion , and call the remainder -- $ 193 billion -- savings . No distinctions are made ; spending on a college education is classed the same as spending on a candy_bar . But a college education is a form of investment , hence savings , argue many economists . David Bradford of Princeton_University says that saving should be defined as adding_to the wealth of the nation . A college education is saving because it improves human capital -- &quot; a form of wealth that swamps all others in importance , &quot; Bradford says . American education over recent decades is an unappreciated story : In 1960 , only 41 % of all Americans finished high_school . Now 80 % do . In 1960 , 7.7 % of the population completed four years of college . Now the figure is more_than 20 % . The advances are notable among all races and ethnic_groups . The $ 40 billion that individuals spend on tuition each year , and the $ 60 billion that state , local and federal_governments spend , is truly investment . Housing also is a factor of national wealth and therefore saving . But you don ' t have to be an economist to see that makes_sense . The 60 million U.S. homeowners all see their houses as wealth and a nest_egg for retirement . Calculated in the broader perspective of wealth , the real U.S. savings rate is more comparable_to the high savings rates of Japan and many countries in Europe , in which higher education and home ownership are not as widespread among the population . That doesn ' t mean all is rosy . Years of lagging income gains for U.S. workers and lagging corporate profits have affected American saving , says economist Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution . But pensions and Social_Security are not the problem , even though they receive a lot of mistaken publicity . In pensions the trend is back to employer guarantees of retirement income as a percentage of pay , after a decade in which defined-contribution plans grew rapidly . In defined-contribution plans , employees make investment decisions about their own retirement_funds , to which employers contribute but make no guarantee . One problem was that employees often invested too conservatively , choosing fixed-interest guaranteed investment contracts rather than going_for higher returns in common_stock mutual_funds , as professional investors would advise . The solution , to which some 200 companies are turning , is called a cash balance account . Employers contribute a percentage of the employee ' s wage and guarantee a return on investment of the funds . The money is managed professionally , explains Mark Maselli , a partner in Kwasha Lipton , a benefits consulting_firm in Ft . Lee , N.J. , that devised the first cash balance plan for Bank of America in 1984 . Social_Security is in good_shape after being adjusted in 1983 to allow_for Medicare expenditures and the fact that Americans are living longer . The system will need adjustment again early in the next century , says Eugene Steurle , co-author of &quot; Retooling Social_Security for the 21st Century. &quot; But meanwhile , it will run in surplus until roughly 2020 . So the real problem with retirement saving is that the baby_boom generation hasn ' t got serious about putting money aside for retirement . One explanation is that many boomers had children later in life and are now paying college tuitions rather than investing in IRA and 401 ( k ) accounts . When they do invest , they might take_a_look at a survey that U.S. Trust Co . took among wealthy Americans -- those with $ 3 million net worth or $ 200 # 000 annual incomes . What do the rich do with their money ? They put 37 % of it into common_stocks or stock mutual_funds -- 19 % in blue_chips , 10 % in small companies and 8 % in equity mutual_funds . They put relatively little in bonds , other_than 10 % in tax-exempt municipal_bonds . And they keep more_than 20 % in bank_accounts , money funds and Treasury_bills . The bottom_line : We should all save because we can look_forward to more years of retirement than ever . Life_expectancy when Social_Security began in 1935 was about 64 years for women , 59 years for men . Today it is about 80 years for women and 73 for men . Evidently , the national health has improved along with the national wealth .</TEXT>
