   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO RELEASE IMMIGRATION FUNDS TO STATE ; FINANCES : THE $ 33.4 MILLION WILL HELP DEFRAY EXPENSE OF JAILING UNDOCUMENTED FELONS . GOVERNOR CALLS IT ' A DROP IN THE BUCKET. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Responding to a sensitive political issue , Justice_Department officials said Thursday that they will expedite payment of $ 33.4 million to California , and smaller amounts to six other states to help cover the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants who have violated criminal_laws . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said the disbursement -- the first of its kind by any Administration -- follows pleas by governors , including California Republican Pete Wilson , that criminal illegal immigrants are an unfair burden on states because only the federal_government can prevent illegal immigration . Reno said the initial disbursement of $ 42 million to seven states will be followed in a_few months by an additional $ 88 million , of which California again will receive the largest share . The first-year funding for state costs of holding illegal immigrants was approved by Congress as part of the department ' s recently passed budget , with help from leading Democratic members of Congress . Over the next six fiscal_years , beginning Oct . 1 , 1995 , the massive anti-crime bill passed_by Congress will give states an additional $ 1.7 billion for housing illegal immigrant prisoners . These funds , however , are yet to be appropriated by Congress . Wilson ' s office responded to the announcement by calling the initial grant &quot; a drop_in the bucket &quot; compared to the state ' s annual expenditure on criminal illegal immigrant inmates , which the governor ' s office placed at $ 475 million . &quot; But we would not even be seeing this limited federal money were it not for the governor ' s relentless pursuit of the President and Congress , &quot; spokesman Sean Walsh said . &quot; California is owed substantially more_than this. &quot; Walsh added that &quot; Californians will not be satisfied until the federal_government starts shutting_off the flow of illegal immigrants coming_across the border because otherwise the incarceration problem will not be solved. &quot; A spokesman for California Treasurer Kathleen Brown , who is running against Wilson for governor , called the money an &quot; important down_payment in meeting the federal_government ' s obligation. &quot; Justice_Department officials acknowledged that the initial $ 33.4 million for California will only defray a small part of the prison costs but noted that a recent White House-commissioned study placed California ' s costs at $ 368 million a year -- substantially less than the figure cited by Wilson . However , that report by the respected Urban Institute , a Washington think_tank with immigration expertise , added that California incurs significant related costs as well , including $ 1.28 billion annually to educate the children of illegal immigrants and up_to $ 166 million in emergency Medicaid services for illegal immigrants . Aside from California , New York initially will receive $ 4.1 million ; Texas , $ 2.1 million ; Florida , $ 1.1 million ; Arizona , $ 991 # 900 ; New Jersey , $ 600 # 600 , and Illinois , $ 564 # 200 . Reno told reporters that the federal grants &quot; are not meant to settle any lawsuits &quot; that have been filed by California or other states to force the government to pay its share of costs . &quot; These grants are meant instead to represent the first_step on a down_payment for what we believe is our fair share of the costs , &quot; Reno said , although she did not specify what the Administration believes its fair share should be . The department also will work with state officials on deporting some immigrant prisoners , she said . But Reno noted that deportation in the U.S. Southwest &quot; may_not be as helpful &quot; because illegal aliens often cross the border again . In a related matter , Associate Atty . Gen . John R . Schmidt said that money for hiring more local police_officers will start flowing to California and other states next week . Schmidt said the department will start distributing the first $ 200 million and &quot; California will receive a hefty share. &quot; The recently approved anti-crime legislation provides_for hiring 100 # 000 more local police_officers over six years starting Oct . 1 , 1995 , but Schmidt said the first disbursements will be taken from previously appropriated funds from other bills &quot; to get the program off to a running start. &quot; Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has said that the funds , on a matching basis , will help him accomplish his goal of hiring 4 # 000 more police_officers over the next five years , perhaps doing so sooner than anticipated . Rep . Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said funds for California and his own state for incarcerated illegal immigrants &quot; are long overdue. &quot; He joined Reno at her news briefing as a key legislator who helped get the money appropriated . &quot; The states have no power to enforce federal immigration policy and yet they ' re left with the burden of costs , &quot; Brooks said . &quot; For the first time , this program is turning promises into cash. &quot; Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , who also appeared with Reno , said the money represents &quot; a significant first_step for the federal_government in taking responsibility for its own policy. &quot; California Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) also commended the Justice_Department ' s action . &quot; I cannot overemphasize the importance of this to California , where there are between 23 # 000 and 35 # 000 undocumented aliens incarcerated in state_prisons , &quot; Beilenson said .</TEXT>
