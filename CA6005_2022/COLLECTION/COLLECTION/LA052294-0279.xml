   <HEADLINE> THE PLOTS THICKEN ; GARDENS : ARLETA CLUB ' S LAND IS FLOURISHING WITH FRUITS , VEGETABLES AND COMPANIONSHIP THAT LINKS PEOPLE OF MANY HERITAGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beneath a towering row of power_lines , a meeting of nations is taking_place at the Arleta Community Garden Club . Anna Simone , 70 , of Sun Valley is hacking away some devil ' s grass from neatly tended plots where she is growing fava_beans , escarole , dandelions and that most Italian of vegetables -- tomatoes . &quot; I show you a tomato ! &quot; says the vigorous Simone , pointing to the product of a handful of seeds she brought_back from Italy last year . &quot; I like this work. &quot; Nearby , Harut Chakmakchian is kneeling beside his purple basil , to be used in Greek foods for family and friends . &quot; Salad , &quot; says Chakmakchian , who knows almost no English , pointing to the tiny plants . The bitter melons of Filipino Rene Daliva lie next to Chinese-American Donald Chu ' s garden , along with the crops of Mexican , Japanese and Central_American immigrants -- 95 members in all , growing fruits and vegetables they couldn ' t find in most San Fernando Valley supermarkets , as well as garden staples like corn and tomatoes . Started in 1976 , Arleta ' s garden club is now bigger than ever -- with 20 new members and two new parcels_of_land to till -- after resolving a dispute with the Department of Water and Power last year . The DWP , which lets the club farm below its electrical towers along Canterbury Avenue , discovered that it had unknowingly paid the bill for a large portion of the garden ' s water over the years -- about $ 35 # 000 . The DWP asked the club to pay more for water , not farm within 50 feet of any tower and create a 16-foot access_road through the middle of the garden , or leave the property . &quot; We were blamed for the way the DWP was neglecting their property , &quot; said garden-master David Winseman , who spends about three hours a day on the site . The garden club -- mostly made_up of senior_citizens and low-income families who rely_on the garden for sustenance or entertainment -- grudgingly agreed , expecting to have to raise their members ' yearly water rates from $ 8 to $ 20 per plot to meet the demand . The increase was significant , since many of the gardeners work_up to a dozen of the 15-foot plots . Under a compromise , the rates were only raised to $ 10 . DWP officials have since revised regulations on watering gardens citywide , making_it cheaper for urban garden clubs to water their crops . The DWP maintained throughout the controversy last year that it never considered expelling the garden club , and simply asked the club to support itself . Since then , relations with the DWP and a handful of neighbors opposed to the garden have blossomed , and the club now is allowed to farm on about 7 1 / 2 acres of DWP land , up from about six acres , according to Winseman . Some residents are still less than supportive of the garden , however . &quot; We have a 12-foot window and it overlooks this stupid garden , &quot; said Sheila Badger , 69 , one of the few residents opposed to the club who hasn ' t moved_out . &quot; Our main concern is the beer drinking and urinating that goes_on over there . And they ' ve been growing some kind of sugar_cane to make alcohol . We ' re the only English-speaking people around here . Those old_men sit around there all day long . What can they do with 40 tomato bushes ? &quot; Instead of losing members as a result of the water rate increase , the club has significantly grown instead , and there is a waiting list for garden plots , Winseman said . Don Holdstock , 65 , of Panorama City has been working in the garden for 15 years . Now that he is retired , the garden is a way to stay active and get_out of the house . &quot; At the time I started , I was working , so it was just fun , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , I ' m retired , so it helps me get the cobwebs out . I don ' t bowl or anything like that. &quot; Many of the members feel a kinship with others who enjoy working the land . The club is planning a picnic for the end of June , when members can enjoy the fruits of each other ' s labor as well as their own . &quot; It ' s fun , &quot; said club president Mel Vargas , 64 , a former employee of the Los Angeles County Arboretum . &quot; One of the reasons I fought the DWP for a year is that these are mainly poor people who don ' t have much money , or things to do , so they need this. &quot;</TEXT>
