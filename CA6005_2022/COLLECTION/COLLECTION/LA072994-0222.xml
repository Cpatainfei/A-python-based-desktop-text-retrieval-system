   <HEADLINE> GM EARNS NEARLY $ 2 BILLION IN SECOND QUARTER ; AUTOS : THE NO . 1 CAR_MAKER HITS ANOTHER MILESTONE IN ITS REMARKABLE TURNAROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> General Motors on Thursday reported that it earned a record $ 1.92 billion in the second quarter , as surging sales allowed the auto_maker to boost prices on many of its models while its cost-cutting efforts also produced major savings . The report was another milestone in a remarkable turnaround at the nation ' s largest auto_manufacturer . GM had posted total operating losses of more_than $ 8.41 billion in 1991 and 1992 and closed dozens of plants . The profits were more_than doubled from the year-ago quarter and capped a week of record earnings announcements by the nation ' s Big Three auto_makers . Ford Motor Co . said Wednesday that its second-quarter profit also doubled , to $ 1.71 billion , and Chrysler said its net_income jumped 40 % to $ 956 million . &quot; Its a great accomplishment and says a lot about the U.S. manufacturing base , &quot; said George Magliano , an auto analyst at WEFA Group in New York . &quot; Here they thought Detroit was dead and were writing them off &quot; just a_few years ago . * Despite logging the best quarterly profit in its history , GM still has its share of problems , financial analysts say . GM ' s share of the U.S. market slipped to 33.1 % in the quarter from 34.8 % last year , while company executives admit that their per-vehicle profit remains below the industry average and that their plants could be run more efficiently . The record profits were_due largely to a turnaround in GM ' s key North_American automotive operations , which account_for most of the company ' s annual revenue . Those operations posted a $ 723-million profit in the quarter on a 10 % rise in sales , compared to a $ 33-million loss a year earlier . The company said earnings from its international automotive operations rose to $ 543 million from $ 306 million a year earlier , thanks to a slow recovery in the European economy and continued strong results in Latin_America . Surging demand by U.S. consumers has allowed GM and other auto_makers to raise prices on many of their models and trim_back costly incentive_programs . But in some ways , that strong demand has proven to be a double-edged sword for GM . The company couldn ' t build enough of some of its most popular models in the second quarter -- including its highly profitable sport-utility vehicles and other light trucks . &quot; This was a solid quarter , &quot; said David Healy , an analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; But they had a thinner mix of more profitable vehicles , which made them earn less than they might have otherwise. &quot; GM said it earned an average of $ 650 on each car it sold in the second quarter , up from about $ 265 last year . But despite that improvement , its per-car profits were about $ 300 below Ford ' s and more_than $ 600 below Chrysler ' s . * The auto_maker said the profit_margin at its North_American operations was only 2.7 % , which GM officials called &quot; considerably short &quot; of the company ' s goal of an annual profit_margin of 5 % . And while GM Chief Financial Officer J . Michael Losh said cost-cutting efforts added $ 330 million to its quarterly profit , he said more changes are needed to make the auto_maker more competitive . Losh didn ' t say what additional cost-cutting moves may be made , although the company is still in the process of trimming thousands from its work_force .</TEXT>
