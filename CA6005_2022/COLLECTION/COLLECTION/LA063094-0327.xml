   <HEADLINE> LONE STAR STEAKHOUSE CHAIN REALLY SIZZLING ; RESTAURANTS : WICHITA PIZZA ENTREPRENEUR ' S RESEARCH FOUND THAT WHILE BEEF CONSUMPTION WAS DOWN AT_HOME , PEOPLE STILL WANT A GOOD STEAK WHEN THEY GO_OUT TO EAT . HIS BUSINESS IS BOOMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may be known for beef , but fast-growing Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon Inc. had its beginnings in pizza . The steakhouse chain , which has expanded from eight restaurants to 75 in just three years , dates_back to 1989 , when Wichita native Jamie Coulter considered taking his 100 Pizza Hut franchises public . But Coulter and his managers couldn ' t add enough Pizza Hut franchises to expand as they wanted . And when the Steak and Ale chain of Dallas was put_up for_sale , Coulter and his team started thinking beef . &quot; Here was a 150-unit chain doing $ 1.7 million per restaurant and they hadn ' t even reinvested to keep the concept fresh , &quot; said John D . White , Lone Star ' s chief financial_officer . Steak and Ale and sister chain Bennigan ' s were eventually sold to a management-led investor group . But a little research showed Coulter and his team that a reported drop_in beef consumption that had spanned several years was mostly in home cooking . When people went_to a restaurant , they still wanted a good steak . So Coulter had a talk with a longtime friend in North Carolina who said he ' d converted one of his restaurants to a Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon , which was booming . &quot; It would have taken us 12 to 18 months to refine our own concept and get_it to_the_point the founders already were with Lone Star , &quot; said S . Douglas Glendenning , Lone Star ' s chief operating officer . Coulter joined forces with the North Carolina outfit and the new Lone Star was off and running . With Coulter as chairman and chief_executive , Lone Star grew rapidly . Last year , profits tripled to $ 14.9 million , or 46 cents per share , compared with $ 4.7 million , or 18 cents a share , a year earlier . Sales surged to $ 95.8 million in 1993 from $ 33.9 million . Lone Star ' s steakhouse and saloon atmosphere includes a deli case full of steaks , cut by hand each day , and a mesquite-fired grill with a sign that encourages patrons to , &quot; Take_a_look . Watch it cook. &quot; Waiters and waitresses at Lone Star restaurants wear &quot; Don ' t Mess with Texas &quot; T-shirts . Customers are served buckets of peanuts as they wait and are encouraged to throw the shells on the floor . &quot; People like to do that , &quot; said White . &quot; You don ' t get_to do_it at_home . Maybe that ' s the allure. &quot; Checks average $ 16 to $ 18 per person . Most of Lone Star ' s restaurants are in the upper Midwest , with some in the deep_South and the mid-Atlantic states . &quot; They ' re opening 45 more this year and another 45 next year , &quot; said Ron Tartaro , an investment analyst at Fred Alger Management in San Diego . &quot; In excess of 50 % growth ? Nobody that ' s as big as Lone Star is doing that. &quot; The company went public on the Nasdaq stock_market in 1991 , raising $ 16.5 million in its initial stock offering and another $ 120 million in subsequent offerings . Lone Star has used the funds to fuel its growth . &quot; The management had been working as a team at least 10 years prior to that , &quot; Tartaro said . &quot; They had experience opening_up a great many Pizza Huts in a short period of time. &quot; Glendenning cited various systems for measuring performance that have allowed Lone Star to keep its expansion on track . He said information is the key . Every morning he and other top_executives review a so-called flash report that contains daily meal counts , net sales , week-to-date sales , labor costs and other information on each of the 75 restaurants . Beef , which makes_up 80 % of each restaurant ' s sales , is inventoried daily . &quot; We continue to tweak and tune , &quot; White said . &quot; We ' re always looking_at how to do something better. &quot;</TEXT>
