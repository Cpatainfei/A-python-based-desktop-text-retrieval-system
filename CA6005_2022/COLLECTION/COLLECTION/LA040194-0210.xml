   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : CALABASAS ; COURT REJECTS SOKA ' S BID FOR SEPARATE TRIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Making only minor changes to an earlier ruling , a state appeals court on Thursday affirmed that Soka University should fight the condemnation of its Calabasas campus in Los Angeles County courts . The 11-page opinion by the 2nd District Court of Appeal amended a Feb . 15 decision , in which the three-judge panel reached essentially the same conclusion . Thursday ' s revised ruling was done to clarify legal points raised by Soka , which is locked_in a bitter fight with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy over its campus at the corner of Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway . Conservancy officials want to condemn 245 acres of the campus to use as a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . The Japanese language_school wants to expand into a liberal arts college . After trying unsuccessfully to buy Soka ' s property , the conservancy in late 1992 launched eminent_domain proceedings -- the process by which a public agency can force a private_property owner to sell . Soka lawyers claimed the conservancy did not follow proper procedure when it began the process and sued to halt the action in court . Early last year , a Ventura County judge agreed with Soka and ruled that the conservancy had erred . But justices deciding a conservancy appeal ruled that Soka should raise its objections to the conservancy ' s actions in eminent_domain proceedings in Los Angeles County -- not in a series of separate trials . Responding to Thursday ' s ruling , Soka administrators vowed to press their concerns before the California Supreme Court later this spring , an action that probably would cause further delays in the case . &quot; We continue to be very sanguine about the whole_thing , &quot; said Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan . &quot; It ' s like watching grass grow -- it takes a long time. &quot; AARON CURTISS</TEXT>
