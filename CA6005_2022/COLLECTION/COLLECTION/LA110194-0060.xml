   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; VASLUI , ROMANIA ; HAMMER AND CYCLE OF DESPERATION ; MISTRUST , MANIPULATION AND DEFEATISM THWART THE QUEST FOR A BETTER LIFE AFTER THE RAVAGES OF COMMUNISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a paneled office high above the whining lathes and deafening compressors of the Moldova Mechanical Enterprise , Director Gigi Tiplea oscillates nervously in his swivel_chair and narrows his eyes with suspicion . He is discomfited by questions about the shrinking staff and flagging output of the cavernous workshops that sprawl across hundreds of acres , a dehumanizing monument to Eastern Europe ' s Communist-era obsession with development on a Gargantuan scale . &quot; Why do you need to know such details ? &quot; he demands of a reporter who has come_to gauge the course of change in this proletarian bastion after Eastern Europe ' s bloodiest overthrow of a Communist regime five years ago . Tiplea grudgingly discloses that 4 # 000 workers have been laid_off from his failing enterprise , still Vaslui ' s biggest employer , and that most of the remaining 2 # 000 would also have to go if he was forced to live within a budget . When the talk turns_to plans for the future and prospects for foreign investment , the director explodes into a fit of paranoia . &quot; Don ' t think we don ' t know what security service you work for ! &quot; Tiplea suddenly bellows at his visitor , whipping open a drawer and brandishing a letter . The single-page missive in poor English , purported to be from a trading company in Nigeria , might indeed have been a crude provocation from what remains of Romania ' s once-omnipotent Securitate secret_police . The months-old letter seems to be enticing the factory boss to take_part in some sort of scam . But what it had to do with a discussion of how Vaslui has deteriorated from an industrial stronghold to the depths of despair was unclear to the journalist , and indeed to Tiplea himself . Accusation is a skillful evasion technique , in the doctrine of former Communists , even if all that is being avoided is a discussion of the cruelties of fate . Fear of change , suspicion of foreigners and a stubborn refusal to acknowledge failings are reactions as natural as breathing for those who learned the skills of survival behind the Iron_Curtain . Despite having thrown_off hard-line communism five years ago , millions of workers and managers in the region -- people like Tiplea -- remain locked in a time warp , indoctrinated in the adversarial politics of a bygone era and seemingly incapable of learning another way . In places such_as Vaslui , where the quest_for a better life after the ravages of communism has gone horribly wrong , people remain stuck in a rut of mistrust , manipulation and defeatism that sabotages every inclination toward reform . Unemployment here is officially 37 % and in reality much higher , as most surviving factories have no product orders and have sent their employees on indefinite leave . Many of the 80 # 000 people who lived_in Vaslui five years ago have fled abroad or to other areas of Romania , leaving the dark , decaying workers ' apartment blocks half-empty . The entire town , built_up from nothing a quarter of a century ago on the parched plains of Moldova , has the look of having been used_up and discarded . Broken windows and unlit corridors give even working factories an abandoned appearance . Street lights and traffic_signals were long ago turned_off to save electricity . Gas prices of about $ 1 a gallon might be considered a bargain elsewhere in Europe , but in Vaslui most cars have been garaged or left in yards for children to play in . Streets are empty but for pedestrians and groaning buses . The most depressed town in the poorest region of arguably the most devastated country of the former East Bloc , Vaslui typifies the tragedy of Stalinist experiments that toyed_with a society ' s natural_order . The late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu created dozens of towns like this one in the late 1960s and 1970s when he herded farmers into cities to work in factories in a fevered quest_for mass industrialization . Vaslui was transformed in a_few short months of 1970 from a sleepy village of woodworkers into a monolithic company town , complete with shabby , prefabricated high-rises thrown_up in haste for the workers forcibly moved_out of the fields and forests . &quot; The idea was that each county would be raised to a high level of development by the location of a major industry in its central town , &quot; explains Pompiliu Sirghe , local liaison with the national Ministry of Labor and one of many political survivors from the apparatus built by Ceausescu . The overnight buildup succeeded in providing a subsistence living for Vaslui laborers , but only so_long as the closed circle of the Moscow-led Comecon trading alliance assured a market for even the shoddiest goods . The Vaslui cog in the pre-revolutionary wheel of East Bloc industry produced mostly extraction and ventilation equipment for mining -- a sector of the economy that has fallen on particularly bad times and taken its provincial suppliers down with it . Today , Vaslui ' s laid-off masses might be said to be free to return to the countryside . But one lesson of dictatorship everyone seems to have learned well is that nothing good ever comes from taking_charge or taking chances . The migrations broke the bond between land and peasant and stripped workers of all initiative , pounding home the message that they had no power over their own futures . Liliana Codrescu has been without work since a local textile plant cut half of its work_force a_few months after the revolution . The collapse of Comecon meant supplies of cheap cotton from Central Asian republics were no longer forthcoming , and the fabric factory was having trouble finding buyers for its slipshod wares . Codrescu , 39 , is widowed with two children and gets a $ 15-a-month death_benefit from her late husband ' s employer . The pittance paid by the Romanian government to its jobless expired a year ago , and Codrescu is the first to admit that prospects of being called_back to the textile plant are nil . But the thin , sullen woman shrugs helplessly when asked how she ' ll manage . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; she says , sighing morosely . &quot; Maybe we will all starve. &quot; Her 20-year-old daughter , Loredana , was lured to Cyprus over the summer with a thirdhand promise of a hotel maid ' s job . She returned home_in September with shoes and coats for her brother and mother , some gold jewelry , expensive lingerie and a silent determination not to go_back . &quot; We don ' t ask what she did there , &quot; says neighbor Eugenia Stefanescu with a knowing yet sympathetic look . &quot; She brought_back some sneakers for my Michaela , which God knows she needed , but I don ' t like to think_about where they came from. &quot; Stefanescu , also a widow and heading into a five-month season of being unemployed when the dairy she works_at closes for winter , fears mostly for her own pretty daughter , who has no prospects of finding work when she finishes her last year of high_school in the spring . &quot; My mother has land in the countryside . We could go_back there and at least know we would eat . But I have no experience with that kind of work , and neither does Michaela , &quot; says Stefanescu , who earns about $ 22 a month at the dairy and must help_out two adult sons whose jobs at Moldova Mechanical have disappeared . Huddled in the dark of the Codrescu apartment , where there is neither a working light_bulb nor the 400 lei ( 23 cents ) needed to buy one , the families fritter_away their idle evenings bemoaning the pitfalls of change and imagining what more might go_wrong . &quot; I would like to work in a private shop that sells makeup or dresses . But no owner will hire me unless I have 100 # 000 lei to kick into the business , &quot; says Loredana , citing a sum of less than $ 60 but one that might as well be a_million in a household that can ' t muster 23 cents . While Romania ' s casualties of economic transition have a tendency to see doom in every venture , a conspicuous mafia of local hucksters does appear to have an exclusive lock on private business . &quot; It ' s impossible to do anything here . Those with connections control everything , &quot; insists Eugen Sacaleanu , who two years ago slipped illegally across the Hungarian and Austrian borders to get_to Italy , where he earns more_than $ 1 # 000 each month as a waiter . &quot; I would n ' t live here again for anything . Even with money I would n ' t succeed . I ' ve just come_to get my wife and daughter. &quot; That there is no future worth working for here is a conclusion drawn by frightening numbers of Romanians , who make_up a hefty share of the illegal immigrant populations in most West European_countries . With no feel_for the land , no concept of service and little chance of success in commerce , most unemployed workers have grown accustomed to their role as reform ' s victims . The few with initiative , such_as Sacaleanu , have given_up on their homeland and voted with their feet . The pervasive fatalism stems largely from the Communist era , when Ceausescu ' s maniacal drive for a Greater Romania dictated every decision for the people , from what they should eat to the number of children each woman should bear . But Vaslui ' s mayor , Victor Cristea , also invokes eastern Romania ' s history of Russian and Turkish occupation in explaining why the local population seems paralyzed by expectations of defeat . &quot; We have a different mentality than the Romanians who live_in Transylvania , which was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire for centuries , &quot; he says . &quot; The Hapsburg occupiers imposed civilization and culture , while those who came here only took_away what they could . That is why we feel disadvantaged . People have always been afraid to build anything here . They think it will only be taken away. &quot; Unable to make the broken machinery of a command economy work anymore and unwilling to risk building another system , those in positions of authority in basket-case towns such_as Vaslui resort_to the knee-jerk Communist practice of denying reality . &quot; The type of products we make here will be needed in the future . These are just transitional difficulties , &quot; insists Tiplea . Laid-off workers who still live here continue to show_up for monthly discussions about the prospects for a return to their jobs , undeterred by the consistent message that there is no relief on the horizon . Impoverished both financially and spiritually , the resentful victims of Romania ' s stalled transformation say they are nostalgic for the days of dictatorship , preferring the vague ache in their souls induced by repression to the sharp pain of hunger now felt in their stomachs . &quot; I wish the revolution never happened , &quot; says Michaela Stefanescu , who was 12 when Ceausescu was toppled . &quot; Maybe we didn ' t have a lot of freedom then , but now we don ' t have enough food , and you ' re not safe on the streets . Young people have nothing to look_forward to . We just stay inside and worry about how we ' ll survive tomorrow. &quot;</TEXT>
