   <TEXT> Janine just wanted to be a good mother . She started drinking alcohol when she was 15 and using methamphetamines when she was 16 . She drank to numb the pain of a boyfriend ' s death . By the time she was 21 , she had a daily alcohol habit and knew she was an alcoholic . While pregnant , Janine drank beer and tomato_juice with her prenatal vitamins . Soon she was drinking_up to two cases of beer a day . After going_into premature labor , Janine ' s baby arrived -- twin girls , both born with fetal_alcohol_syndrome . Like Janine , many women will experience the devastating effects of alcohol and other drug_abuse . Babies that fit_in the palm of your hand , with skin too fragile to touch , with tubes and needles sticking into their tiny bodies , keeping them alive -- premature_babies born to addicted mothers . Drug_abuse touches women of all colors and all economic backgrounds . From celebrities to women living_on the street , drug_abuse knows no boundaries . At least one out of nine babies in the United States is born to a mother who uses alcohol and other drugs while pregnant . In California , that ' s 69 # 000 mothers , or 11 % of the state ' s women . This problem has a staggering economic impact when you consider that each drug-exposed child can cost $ 1 million over a lifetime . Fortunately , most of this unnecessary cost can be avoided . For every dollar spent on prevention , $ 30 in return benefits are saved . Prevention , education and treatment for women are where the real cost-saving opportunities exist . This year , more_than $ 55 million is targeted to fight perinatal substance_abuse . The governor ' s Perinatal Alcohol , Drug Treatment and Education program has already served more_than 8 # 000 mothers and their children . Perinatal Substance_Abuse Awareness Week 1994 was a time for individual and community-based action to recognize intervention and treatment as a solution for these women and their children . First , preventing this disease before it starts offers the best return on investment for taxpaying citizens . Second , there must be equal access to comprehensive prenatal health_care , including drug treatment , for all women . Women who do not receive prenatal care are almost three times more likely to use alcohol or other drugs , and three times more likely to smoke . Next , women need intervention for their drug use , not incarceration . Drug use is a public health_problem requiring treatment . We need to ensure that drug-addicted mothers receive the treatment they need to live a drug-free healthy lifestyle for the sake of themselves , their babies and their families . Perinatal substance_abuse is a significant public health_problem . Not only does_it cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year , but the loss of promising lives remains even more devastating . Californians can be proud that we are leading the nation in providing treatment for these women and their children . About 86 % of babies born to women in perinatal programs are born alcohol- and drug-free , indicating the success of these services . According to the American Medical Assn. , there is no safe level of alcohol , drug or tobacco use during pregnancy . Drinking alcohol while pregnant may result in low birth weight , facial defects , small head size , learning and behavior problems , or fetal_alcohol_syndrome . Cocaine use during pregnancy has been associated with premature birth and marked neurobehavioral deficiencies in the infant . Use of tobacco during pregnancy may increase the risk of low birth weight , spontaneous_abortion and stillbirth . Research indicates that pregnancy offers the best opportunity for intervention . Breaking this devastating cycle of addiction could mean freedom from the confines of their disease for women like Janine . There is hope and help . There are treatment centers in Orange County and statewide that can help women from harming themselves and their unborn baby . If you are pregnant , give yourself and your unborn baby the gift of life free from alcohol and other drug_abuse . You deserve a chance to make a difference .</TEXT>
