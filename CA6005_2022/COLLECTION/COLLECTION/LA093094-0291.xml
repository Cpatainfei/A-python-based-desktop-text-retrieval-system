   <HEADLINE> EXPERT PREDICTS 2 % EMPLOYMENT RISE FOR O.C. ; OUTLOOK : CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY ' S JAMES DOTI WARNS THAT A SLOWDOWN IN NATIONAL RECOVERY COULD AFFECT LOCAL HIRING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s fledgling economic recovery is in danger of stalling as a slowdown in national economic_growth discourages hiring by local employers , Chapman University President James Doti said Thursday . Doti , an economist whose forecasts for the county are widely followed by local business planners as they develop their strategies , stuck_to his earlier prediction of 2 % employment growth this year . that ' s about 22 # 000 new jobs . But he said the pace of job growth could slow to 1.5 % by mid-1995 if his scenario for the national economy proves accurate . &quot; The increase ( in national economic_growth ) has come_to an end . And if it ' s peaking , that means that employment growth ( in Orange County ) will begin to peter_out , &quot; he said . His message was the most conservative of three forecasts heard by 600 local business_executives at the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce &amp; Industry ' s annual economic outlook conference here . Economists from Citicorp Investment Services in New York and First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles said they are optimistic about national economic_growth -- predicting a 3 % hike in the gross_domestic_product -- a key measure of the value of goods and services produced nationwide each year . But Doti said he expects declining defense spending to weaken the national recovery . That sluggishness should combine with several local factors , including slowed construction activity , to take the edge off Orange County ' s economic performance . Strong foreign trade will help keep the county from tumbling back into recession , he said . As an important distribution center , the county benefits from overall imports to the United States as well as from overall U.S. exports , Doti said . He bases his projections on information about the national gross_domestic_product , defense spending , imports and exports , and Orange County construction values . Reliable data about local production , defense spending and trade is not available , he said . The nation ' s gross_domestic_product is the most important of the four categories because many Orange County businesses sell their goods and services throughout the country . * Although Doti was downbeat about the prospects of a growing recovery , a 2 % job growth for the year would increase Orange County employment to about 1.14 million jobs and keep it ahead of the rest of the state . Adrian Sanchez , regional economist for First Interstate Bank , said he expects statewide employment to increase by 1.5 % through 1996 . Sanchez said that while California ' s economy began recovering this year , employers are adding just 10 # 000 new jobs a month -- a third of the rate at which the state added jobs from 1983 to 1990 . Because of the slow pace , Sanchez said , &quot; a lot of people aren ' t convinced that this ( recovery ) is the real deal. &quot; The conventional wisdom that California will continue to &quot; underperform the U.S. for at least one more year &quot; may be accurate , he said . California ' s recovery seems disappointing because of the rapid_growth that occurred before 1990 , said Jon Goodman , director of the Entrepreneurial Program at USC . &quot; You all have lived through a 40-year boom -- let me assure you , it was a binge -- and now you have one hell of a hangover , &quot; Goodman told a rapt audience . Job growth is the key to recovery , Goodman said , and California is struggling to keep employers because new information and communications technologies will make_it easier for businesses to locate in less expensive areas that are far from their markets . To compete with less expensive states like Arizona and Utah , California must put a renewed emphasis on public education to attract and hold the companies that make use of the new technologies , she said . &quot; The entire competitive advantage of the future relies_on an educated work_force . But it ' s getting harder and harder to staff businesses &quot; in the region with well-educated young workers , she said . Moreover , those well-educated workers that are available are often more knowledgeable_about new technologies than their managers , putting a premium on the skills of the young and changing relationships within companies . Without improved education and major business restructuring to take_advantage of technical know-how , Goodman warned , &quot; this place is going_to look_like Detroit. &quot; Spencer Kaitz , president of the California Cable_Television Assn. , said the spread of communication technologies such_as facsimile_machines , cellular_phones and electronic_mail means people have less tolerance for waiting . &quot; There ' s a message here for all_of us . . . that the information superhighway is part of a culture of change , &quot; he said . Businesses that are able to take_advantage of the fundamentally lower cost of instant communications will thrive , he said .
