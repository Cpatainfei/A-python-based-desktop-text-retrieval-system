   <TEXT> If space aliens ever show_up for real , don ' t expect them to even begin to resemble the middling monstrosities on &quot; Star Trek. &quot; &quot; Time for us to revise our views of repulsive ! &quot; said Carl Sagan , among the most energetic and eloquent of stargazers . The sheer grandeur of the cosmos and the riddle about whether humankind shares some distant crossroads or voyages alone have bewitched this Russian garment_worker ' s son since childhood . &quot; My experience is that kids are natural-born scientists . First of all , they ask the deep scientific questions : Why is the moon round ? Why is the sky blue ? What ' s a dream ? Why do we have toes ? What ' s the birthday of the world ? &quot; By the time they get_into high_school , they hardly ever ask questions like that . My conclusion is that everybody starts_out as an enthusiastic potential scientist and then has the science beaten_out of them by society. &quot; Sagan said his parents ( &quot; who didn ' t know anything about science &quot; ) not only nurtured his sense of wonder , they also instilled a healthy skepticism . That mixture , he said , is the key to being a scientist . Combined with mental agility and a flair for elucidation , it begins to explain his success in astrophysics , as researcher and popularizer . The author of &quot; Cosmos , &quot; one of the most-watched series in the history of American public television , and &quot; The Dragons of Eden , &quot; which won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1978 , scans the future of space exploration in his 29th book , a recently published &quot; Cosmos &quot; sequel . &quot; Pale Blue Dot &quot; visualizes mankind &quot; 100 , 200 , 300 years from now and why it is in fact central for our survival that we be in space , &quot; he said . Not just whizzing around in spacecraft . Actually settling other worlds . Sagan himself , who just turned 60 , is still performing on the high_wire . Between lectures and symposiums and robotic missions , which he ' s been helping design for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration since the late 1950s , he ' s turning his novel &quot; Contact &quot; into a Hollywood script and writing another novel , this one a &quot; love_story , &quot; with his wife , Ann Druyan . When he gets stuck_on one project , Sagan moves_on to the next , allowing his subconscious to go_to work . &quot; When you come_back , you find to your amazement , nine times_out of 10 , that you have solved your problem -- or your unconscious_mind has -- without you even knowing it. &quot; At Cornell University ' s Laboratory for Planetary Studies , which he set_up in 1968 , space-mission data go_into lab simulations to draw lessons about dust_storms on Mars or the greenhouse_effect of Venus . Organic molecules , the kind that life on Earth is dependent_on , &quot; seem to be almost everywhere in the solar_system beyond Mars , &quot; suggesting that &quot; life and intelligence ought to be in lots of places , &quot; he said . But extraterrestrials would &quot; almost certainly not &quot; bear any physical resemblance to humans . &quot; If you started the Earth over again , absolutely identical 4 1 / 2 billion years ago , and just let random factors operate -- when a cosmic ray would hit a gene , which gene gets mutated -- you might wind_up with intelligence of great moral virtue , but they would not look anything like us , &quot; he said . While detection techniques are limited to spacecraft and radio_telescopes , finding_out whether mankind is alone , or not alone , &quot; is one of the most important issues you can imagine , &quot; Sagan said . Trying to convince earthlings of that is not always easy . &quot; The trouble often is , you can ' t just invent something , you have to have underlying science , &quot; Sagan said . &quot; It is foolish for us not to encourage at every level in the educational system better support for science education and for the encouragement of young scientists . From the most practical self-interest , if you care about anything else , our policy is foolish. &quot; Who ' s to blame when science takes a back seat ? Parents and teachers . Politicians who emphasize short-term solutions over long-term ones . Newspapers that publish &quot; hokum &quot; horoscopes in place of science columns . &quot; When ' s the last time you had an intelligent unprompted remark on science by a president of the United States ? Put that all together and you can see that there ' s a problem that just runs_up and down the society. &quot; As for UFOs , lost continents and the_like , the world can ill afford such pseudoscientific twaddle , Sagan said . &quot; Nobody would be more interested than me if we were being visited by extraterrestrials , but I demand reasonable standards of evidence , just as I do_in searching for radio_signals , &quot; he said . &quot; We sometimes pretend something is true not because there ' s evidence for it but because we want it to be true . We confuse reality with our hopes and fears , and that is dangerous not just on the borders of science but in politics and lots of other places. &quot; Not least when it comes_to deeply held beliefs about our origins . &quot; What if the universe is infinitely old ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Then there ' s no reason to posit a creator because it wasn ' t created. &quot; Then what is meant by &quot; God ? &quot; &quot; There ' s a wide range of things that are called God , from the outsized , light-skinned male with the long white beard who sits on a throne in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow , to the kind of God of Einstein and Spinoza , which is something like the sum_total of the laws_of_nature . &quot; Who could deny that there are laws_of_nature that apply everywhere in the universe ? So , whether you say ' Absolutely , of course , there ' s a God ! ' or ' What are you talking_about , there ' s not a smidgen of evidence for a God ! ' depends in a very deep way on what kind of God you ' re talking about. &quot; Sagan said he has encountered &quot; surprisingly little &quot; hostility from people who equate evolutionary research with the_devil ' s work to undermine religious faith . &quot; I think most people appreciate having a little -- clarity maybe is too strong a word -- but anyway , a different point_of_view which makes them think . Many people realize I am searching for the same thing they are , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
