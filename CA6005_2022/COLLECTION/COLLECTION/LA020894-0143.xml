   <HEADLINE> EX-JDL ACTIVIST GETS LIFE TERM IN BOMB DEATH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A former Jewish Defense League activist was sentenced to life in prison Monday for his role in the 1980 mail bomb death of a secretary at a Manhattan Beach computer company . Robert Manning , 42 , fought extradition from Israel for nearly two years before he was returned to Los Angeles and convicted Oct . 14 of mailing the explosive package that killed 32-year-old Patricia Wilkerson . U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian cited the &quot; callous &quot; and &quot; hideous &quot; nature of Manning ' s crime in sentencing him to the maximum term . Manning will be eligible for parole in 30 years . &quot; Mr. Manning , in this court ' s opinion , is clearly a danger to society , &quot; Tevrizian said , adding that the life sentence is commensurate with Manning ' s &quot; utter disregard for the public. &quot; Before he was sentenced , Manning denied involvement in what he called a &quot; horrible crime &quot; and asked the judge to recommend that he be imprisoned in Israel . &quot; This whole_thing is sickening to me , &quot; Manning said . &quot; I would n ' t have anything to do with this sort of thing. &quot; Manning ' s attorney , who had asked at the start of the court session to be removed from the case , told Tevrizian after the sentence was pronounced that his client should be eligible for parole after 10 years . Attorney Richard Sherman said the federal statute in place in 1980 called_for a maximum term of 30 years , with a parole date in one-third that time . But Tevrizian refused to revise his sentence , telling Manning and Sherman that they could appeal the conviction and the sentence if they believed it was wrongly imposed . Also accused of complicity in the murder and scheduled for trial in July are Manning ' s wife , Rochelle , 53 , and former real_estate_agent William Ross . Rochelle Manning is fighting extradition from Israel . Ross was recently returned to Los Angeles after fleeing to Canada . &quot; We ' re elated with the sentencing , and we feel it closes a chapter in this horrendous case , &quot; said Michael Ahern , acting chief postal inspector in_charge of the Los Angeles division , whose agents investigated the bombing . &quot; We ' re looking_to the trials of the remaining two defendants. &quot; Ahern and his agents doggedly pursued Manning and his wife and fought for their extradition from Israel . Prosecutors have said that Ross was embroiled in a real_estate dispute and lawsuit with Wilkerson ' s employer , Brenda Crouthamel-Adams , who ran the computer firm ProWest with her husband . Ross enlisted the Mannings to build and mail the bomb , prosecutors said . Crouthamel-Adams was too busy to open the cardboard box when it arrived , so she left it on Wilkerson ' s chair , prosecutors said . When Wilkerson unwrapped the package later in the day , she found a metal device , prosecutors said . Accompanying it were instructions to plug it into an electrical outlet to hear a recorded message . Wilkerson plugged_in the device , triggering a blast that killed her and destroyed the ProWest offices . Robert Manning also has been named by federal authorities as the prime suspect in the 1985 bombing death in Santa Ana of Alex Odeh , head of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee ' s western office . Manning has not been charged in that case . And he is a suspect in several other bombings linked to the late Rabbi Meir Kahane , a militant Jewish leader assassinated in New York in 1990 , officials said . After Odeh ' s death , the Mannings moved to Israel . Meanwhile , investigators in this country found the couple ' s fingerprints on the carton in which the bomb that killed Wilkerson had been sent . In June , 1988 , Rochelle Manning returned to the United States , where she and Ross were tried in the Wilkerson killing . Both were released after a jury was unable to reach a verdict . Rochelle Manning then returned to Israel .</TEXT>
