   <HEADLINE> BOYS OF BEDFORD : A TOWN RECALLS ITS D-DAY HEROES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long gone are the boys of Bedford , gone these 50 years , lost in the roiling English_Channel and on the sands of Omaha , cut_down by German pillboxes and artillery shells that blew men and machines and whole boats out of the water . Gone a half century now , these were the Gold Stars of Bedford , the young_men who would never marry their sweethearts or raise families , who would not return to the farm , who would never gather Saturdays at Green ' s Drug Store and dazzle the younger boys with stories of heroism on D-day , June 6 , 1944 . These men -- 19 sons of Bedford killed on D-day alone , the largest proportion of casualties for any community in the nation -- lie under great oak_trees at the town cemetery and under white crosses on the fields of Normandy . For one of them , Raymond Hoback , all that was found was his Bible , tossing_in the surf , scooped_up by another soldier trudging onward into France . John Wilkes would never again drive down Main_Street in his tan station_wagon with the wood siding , ferrying his buddies and their dates to picnics out on Smith Mountain Lake . Elaine Coffey and Bedford Hoback , engaged to be married after the war , would never move_into their little farm home . Ray Stevens would not shake his brother ' s hand in France , and Earl Parker would never ever see his baby daughter . Such a high price for one small_town . In 1944 , Bedford had just 3 # 400 residents , and only one taxi driver , one undertaker and one sheriff . It fell to them to deliver the telegrams , driving past the farm fields rich_in summer grain , the hillsides covered with loblolly and hardwoods , the clay foothills at the break of the Blue Ridge Mountains . They went_to the Deane home and the Schenk home and the Reynolds home , and stopped twice at the Hobacks ; they lost two sons . Today , their names are engraved in granite on a memorial on the lawn of the Bedford County_Courthouse . The granite was carved out of a Vierville-sur-Mer cave where the men of Company A , 116th Infantry , the &quot; blue and grey &quot; 29th Division , landed on Normandy . There will be a modest courthouse ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary , as there have been at other times , because even after all these years , the grief is still borne by their loved ones in this still small_town of widows and children . Saddest among them , perhaps , was Frank P . Draper Sr. , so overcome with sorrow that he built a large stone monument atop his son ' s grave in Bedford . For Frank Jr. , &quot; Juney &quot; as he called him , the father poured_out his broken heart on that marble sarcophagus : &quot; We loved you Juney , dearly loved you , but God loved you best. &quot; But even that did not cool the grief . One cold January day 20 years ago , Frank Sr . shot himself to death . He now lies buried next to the son he gave to France . There had been happier times . Bedford back then was known by its motto , the &quot; World ' s Best Little Town. &quot; Local news that first week of June , 1944 , was like most of small_town America . County Home and Demonstration agents were giving poultry culling lessons . The school_board was reorganizing . The Tobacco Growers Assn. , big in this part of southwest Virginia , was planning a courthouse meeting later in the week . And 40 local businesses put_out a full-page ad in the Bedford Democrat calling_for readers to support the war effort and &quot; Buy Your Invasion Bonds. &quot; &quot; There ' s a day coming when the enemy will be licked , beaten , whipped to a fare-thee-well ; every_last vestige of fight knocked_out of him , &quot; the ad proclaimed . &quot; And there ' s a day coming when every mother ' s son of us will want to stand_up and yell , to cheer ourselves hoarse over the greatest victory in history. &quot; Then came the day when Elizabeth Teass , working the Western Union machine at Green ' s Drug Store , was suddenly inundated with wires that began &quot; The Secretary_of_War regrets to inform you . . . . &quot; This was_on a Sunday morning in July , six weeks after Bedford families were not only not getting any more letters from their soldiers fighting in Europe , but their own letters to the men were being sent_back unopened . Something was wrong . &quot; Green ' s used to be a happy drugstore , &quot; Teass said about the local hangout , a combination drugstore-diner . &quot; It was a lively affair . Everybody was happy there . &quot; But on this particular morning , Roanoke wired that they had casualties to give us and then they started coming . There was a crowd gathering around , and after the wires had been delivered it was affecting everybody . &quot; Everybody now was coming_down to the drugstore and when it was over , this was a calm , blue Bedford . This was a blue town . So many young_men killed. &quot; Bettie Wilkes learned from a passer-by downtown that her husband , John , who had dreamed of a military career , was killed . &quot; Nothing has been the same since we lost all_the men here , &quot; she said . Viola Parker lost her husband , Earl , and did not know how she would ever tell their 16-month-old daughter . So distraught , she spent the rest of the day indoors , dusting and redusting the furniture . At the Hoback home , where the family was dressing for Sunday services at the Center Point Methodist_Church , the news came that Bedford Hoback was dead . Soon their home was filled with parishioners from the church across the road , offering comfort . The next morning , while the Hoback children were cranking home-made ice_cream in the cellar for their grieving parents , they learned that another brother , Raymond , had also been killed . Some time later , Raymond ' s family Bible arrived in the mail , with a letter from Pvt . H.W. Crayton addressed from &quot; Somewhere in France. &quot; Crayton had plucked the Bible out of the water , convinced that Raymond was alive and probably had just dropped it in the surf . &quot; You have by now received a letter from your son saying he is_well , &quot; Crayton wrote . &quot; I sincerely hope so. &quot; So sure was he that Raymond was safe , Crayton went_on to describe the success of the invasion and the &quot; peaceful and quiet &quot; Normandy beachfront now that the German guns had been silenced . &quot; The birds have begun their daily practice , &quot; he wrote , &quot; all_the flowers and trees are in bloom , and especially the poppies and tulips which are very beautiful at this time of the year. &quot; Unlike the Bible , Raymond ' s body was never recovered . &quot; It was just too_much for us , &quot; recalled Lucille Hoback Boggess , a sister who was just 15 at the time . &quot; My mother was never the same . She later suffered a stroke and lived another 10 years but she couldn ' t speak or remember anything . &quot; It took all_of the joy out of our family . No more family picnics . No more family get-togethers . And my mother never forgave the Germans . Once a German missionary came_to our church , and she would n ' t go see him . It was the first time she ever refused to go_to church. &quot; The local newspaper eulogized the dead . In printing their names under the headline &quot; These Bedford Men Will Not Return , &quot; the Democrat said : &quot; The names of sons of neighbors living next door or on the adjoining farm may be found in this list . Or there may be the names of boys who sat next to some of the readers at school or lads who sold groceries over the counter at a local store. &quot; They were among 197 men in the company assault group on D-day . In all , 30 of them were from Bedford . They were assigned to several landing_craft and then launched across the_English Channel . Roy Stevens , now 74 , remembers speaking with his twin brother , Ray , before splitting up_on the landing boats . They talked_about home and Ray was shaking and he seemed convinced he would n ' t make_it . Ray suggested they shake hands goodby . &quot; No , &quot; Roy told him . &quot; we ' ll shake hands in France. &quot; Some days later , Roy was walking through a makeshift graveyard near the beach when he stumbled across his brother ' s dog_tags nailed to one of the crosses . &quot; I saw several Bedford boys buried up there , &quot; he said . &quot; None of them made it. &quot; He also remembers Earl Parker staring at his little_girl ' s photograph the night before D-day , and his misgivings about the invasion . &quot; If I could only see my baby daughter , I would n ' t mind dying , &quot; Parker told his buddies . He too perished on Normandy . Capt . Taylor N . Fellers , before the war a state_highway foreman in Bedford , skipped out of an Army hospital to make the landing . He had earlier written home about his men : &quot; I ' m beginning to think it ' s hard to beat a Bedford boy as a soldier. &quot; At the beach , Fellers and his boat crew were hit by an artillery shell that , to Bob Slaughter , a soldier from nearby Roanoke , &quot; looked_like it made Capt . Fellers just evaporate into thin air. &quot; Ray Nance , one of the few who did return to Bedford , can still see John Reynolds running ahead of him up the beach . &quot; He went_down_on his knees , and he brought his rifle up as if he were searching for something , and then he fell forward . He was dead. &quot; He can still hear J.D. Clifton screaming into his pack radio near the cliffs . &quot; Suddenly he yelled that he ' d been hit and he died. &quot; And he can see John Wilkes and John Schenk taking heavy sniper fire near their boats , cut_down at the waterline . &quot; You know , &quot; Nance said , &quot; us Bedford boys , we competed to be in the first wave . We wanted to be there . We wanted to be the first on the beach . &quot; We got our wish. &quot;</TEXT>
