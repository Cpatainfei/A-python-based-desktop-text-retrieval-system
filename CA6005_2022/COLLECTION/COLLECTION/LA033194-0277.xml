   <HEADLINE> WANT TO START A NEW FOOTBALL_LEAGUE ? TAKE HIS EXPERT ADVICE -- AND DON ' T</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Isn ' t it time for someone to start another pro football_league ? After all , it has been 20 years since the World Football_League experiment , and 10 years since the U.S. Football_League tried.Both failed . The World League of American_Football didn ' t make much of a splash , either , but it was a development league for the NFL , not competition . Who better to ask about new leagues than Gary Davidson , a founder of the American Basketball Assn. , World Hockey Assn . and the WFL ? &quot; No , it ' s not a good time , &quot; he said . &quot; Even if you got financing to start a new football_league , the numbers would just scare you to death . When we started the ABA , the team budgets were $ 360 # 000 each , per year . That was for everything -- player and administrative salaries , rent , uniforms . . . &quot; NFL player salaries have reached the point where I just can ' t imagine anyone willing to match them . What does surprise me today is that no one has tried another major soccer league until now . There are plenty of stadiums , and it ' s a sport where you can pick your own season . If you fix the rules so you get more scoring , I think soccer would work now. &quot; Alan Rothenberg , president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and the World Cup Organizing Committee , has proposed the formation of a major U.S. pro soccer league for 1995 .
