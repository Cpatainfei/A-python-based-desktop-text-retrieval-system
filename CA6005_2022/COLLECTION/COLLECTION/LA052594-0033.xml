   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : HAIRLESS IN SEATTLE : FANS ARE REALLY BUZZING OVER BUHNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Seattle Mariners offered free admission recently to anyone consenting to a Jay Buhner-style &quot; buzz cut &quot; hairstyle . The Mariners provided barbers outside the Kingdome , and about 400 fans had their locks shaved down to the quarter-inch length that Buhner , a Mariner outfielder , prefers . Another 86 showed_up who had already had themselves buzzed . Buhner commented : &quot; This is the grunge capital of the world. &quot; * Ripping the Pip : Alan Greenberg of the Hartford Courant criticized the Chicago Bulls ' Scottie Pippen , implying that Pippen has muffed the role of Bull main man since Michael Jordan retired . &quot; In or out of Jordan ' s shadow , there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that when it comes_to guts , graciousness and just generally acting grown-up , Scottie Pippen might not be such a pip of a guy , &quot; Greenberg wrote . &quot; When Pippen was introduced to the Chicago crowd , he received not the boos he deserved , but a rousing ovation . Fans will forgive anything if a player can help their team win . No wonder guys such_as Pippen come_to believe that they are bigger than the game . We liked Pippen better when he was in Jordan ' s shadow . Riding_out front , he doesn ' t look too pretty . More like an all-time grate. &quot; * Trivia time : Who are the top three in multiple home_run games ? * Oops : The Colts , who begin play as a Canadian Football_League expansion team in Baltimore , recently took some of that city ' s reporters on a tour of old Memorial Stadium . As Jobie Waldt , Colt facilities director , showed them the TV booth , his right leg went_through the rotted floor , up_to his knee . The stadium needs $ 2 million worth of work . * Ban Boswell : Washington Post columnist Thomas Boswell wrote after the deaths of drivers Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna that auto racing should be banned . Predictably , the Post was deluged with letters . Mike Gleason of Shillington , Pa. , wrote : &quot; Auto racing may be the last bastion of good sportsmanship in American sports . How often do you see ' trash talking ' at an auto race ? How often does a pit-clearing brawl occur in auto racing ? How often does an opposing team in baseball or football offer to give assistance to an up-and-coming team ? This does not happen in any other professional sport . Race_car drivers appeal_to fans because they are just ordinary people. &quot; * No ringer : When Brett Butler ' s son , Blake , was 4 , he asked his father if he could wear an earring . Butler ' s reaction : &quot; At the time , Kal Daniels and Darryl Strawberry wore them , and Blake came_to me and said : ' I want an earring like Darryl . I told him , ' As long as you are in this house , you will not wear an earring. ' And he said , ' Well , I guess I have to move out. ' &quot; * Trivia answer : Babe_Ruth with 72 , Willie Mays with 63 and Henry Aaron with 62 . * Quotebook : The late Jack Benny , on golf : &quot; Give me my golf_clubs , the fresh air , a beautiful partner -- and you can keep my golf_clubs and the fresh air. &quot; EARL GUSTKEY</TEXT>
