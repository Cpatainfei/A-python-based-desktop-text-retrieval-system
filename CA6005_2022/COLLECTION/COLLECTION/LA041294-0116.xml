   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; RAIN OR SHINE , GERMANS ARE DETERMINED TO TAN ; FORGET WARNINGS ABOUT SUN-DAMAGED SKIN . IN THE LAND OF THE PALE , BROWN IS BEAUTIFUL . ' TANNED PEOPLE ARE BETTER TEMPERED , ' THEY INSIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a wet and gray March afternoon , with summer still seemingly light-years away , Gabriele Hagend climbed onto a glowing , violet sun bed and rose 21 minutes later with a summer tan and tremendous &quot; sense of well-being. &quot; Looking_at her pink cheeks , one could hardly tell that she had spent the entire day in an office , the entire winter in Germany . &quot; I don ' t want to look_like I ' m baked , but it ' s quite nice to have a tan all_the time , &quot; the 31-year-old wholesale trader said . &quot; Especially when spring comes , with short pants and skirts . It looks better when your legs are not like cheese sticks. &quot; In the land of the pale , brown is beautiful . And in a sunless land , sun-worshipers abound . An estimated 10 million Germans regularly visit tanning studios , and millions travel south each year to places where the sun is always brighter . Despite the worst recession since World_War_II , Germans are spending about $ 38 billion a year on foreign travel -- more_than any other country -- and their No . 1 priority for a good vacation is good sun . Spain , Italy , Cyprus , the Canary Islands . Most Germans get six weeks of vacation a year , during which they crowd Spanish and Italian beaches now called &quot; the Teutonic Grill. &quot; In agricultural times , when most people labored outdoors , pale was pretty . Only poor farmers were tanned , while the bourgeoisie covered their heads and hands so that they would not be blemished by the sun , an unwanted symbol of the working class . When industrialization took work indoors , however , suddenly it was the laborers who were pale-faced , and suntans were for the rich . A bronzed skin became a sign of leisure and wealth . Now , Germans say that salon tanning not only makes them look better , it makes them feel better . Tanning is an antidote to week after week of gloomy winter . It is also a way to prepare_for later vacations in the sun -- a kind of pre-cook . Christel Mampell , editor of Top Tan magazine , says there are about 5 # 500 tanning salons throughout Germany and many_more sun beds at hotels and sport centers . In the Sonnen Garten -- one of at least 50 sun studios in the Bonn area -- 40 to 50 customers a day take_off their clothes and lie_down for about 15 minutes on a futuristic bed of ultra-violet bulbs that looks_like a cross between a waffle iron and a plastic coffin . They pay about $ 5 to $ 9 for the privilege and for a seamless 360-degree tan . No truck_driver tans . No unsightly bathing_suit marks . No white butts . This possibly matters more to Germans , who find nudity inoffensive and , consequently , spend a good bit more time naked in public than your average American . In summer , it is not uncommon to see men and women sunbathing in_the_buff in city parks . Most saunas are coed and clotheless , as are some swimming_pools and beaches . * Tan-now , pay-later health warnings don ' t get a big reception among the regulars . Shopkeeper Beate Griesenbach waves a post-tanning cigarette at the Sonnen Garten and says , &quot; When you smoke as much as I do , you don ' t have to worry about sun benches. &quot; Office worker Ingrid Kraemer , emerging from a 20 # 000-watt turbo sun bed , adds , &quot; With the hole in the ozone_layer , the real sun is much worse. &quot; In fact , neither is too good . Tanned skin ages more quickly and is more prone to cancer , medical studies show . Sunburns are dangerous , especially in children . Doctors say the incidence of skin_cancer is rapidly increasing in Germany . The national Commission of Early Detection and Prevention of Skin_Cancer , a group of private and governmental medical leaders in Germany , plans a nationwide media campaign against sun_bathing and sun studios beginning in June . Dr. Eckhard Wilhelm Breitbart , a member of the commission , says a similar campaign in 1989 reduced the use of sun studios , but patronage rose again when the commission launched subsequent campaigns against outdoor sun_bathing . Breitbart said about 10 million of the 80 million Germans use ultra-violet sun beds . Because their danger has not been scientifically proven , Breitbart says , many ignore what to doctors seems obvious . &quot; We have plenty of examples of people who use solar beds and have cancer . But there is no serious study that makes a clear correlation between sun beds and skin_cancer because most people who use the sun beds also use the normal sun , &quot; Breitbart says . One fifteen-minute sunning session every two weeks probably is not harmful , he says , but many people overdo it . * Abusers are not hard to find . Trude Hoever , a 33-year-old housing broker , is thin , blonde and dark as leather . Despite her premature wrinkles and freckles , she says she tans three times a week . &quot; I was always very pale and unhappy , &quot; Hoever says at the Ergoline Sonnencenter in St . Augustin . &quot; I need the sun bank like other people need cigarettes . I don ' t need food , but I need my sun bank. &quot; Likewise , Germans need their travel . Neighborhood travel_agencies are to Germany what fast-food restaurants are to the United States : Everywhere and crowded . Customers stand_in line at travel_agencies for help and handfuls of brochures showing blue_skies , white beaches and tanned travelers . In a recession , &quot; vacations are the last thing Germans would give_up , &quot; says travel_agent Marc Herberz at Reisebuero St . Augustin . &quot; Sun means relaxing and getting_away from what we have at home. &quot; Away from the gray weather and pale skin . Or , as tanner Helmut Schramm says at the Ergoline Sonnencenter , away from gray moods . &quot; Tanned people are_better tempered , &quot; Herberz says .</TEXT>
