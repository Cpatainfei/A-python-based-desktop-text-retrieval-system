   <HEADLINE> U.S. MISSION WENDS THROUGH AN AFRICA STRUGGLING TO CHANGE ; DIPLOMACY : NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER ANTHONY LAKE IS TRYING TO BOOST DEMOCRATIC HOPES . HIS EIGHT-DAY TRIP IS TAKING HIM TO NINE NATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the torpid heat of the Mozambican summer , in a village far from paved roads and running water , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake sat on a stool and heard the story of fisherman Jose Chemane Bizho -- the simple story of Africa ' s fragile hopes and frightful danger . &quot; When I was young , &quot; said the bearded fisherman , &quot; I joined the army for two years . But I fought on for 17 . Today , I want my own fishing project . I ' m looking_for somebody to support me and buy me some nets. &quot; Here in the south of Africa , sounds of gunfire have died_out . A brutal civil_war has ended . The same is true in Ethiopia to the north , Rwanda in the center . Even Angola in the west is struggling from the exhaustion of war and searching for the terms of a peace . Soldiers are being asked to become citizens , voters , fishermen . New leaders with business_suits and college degrees are trying to build nations in a fresh model . So on a sweeping pre-Christmas tour of transitional Africa , Lake , the preeminent Clinton_Administration expert on the subject , has been sifting through the ashes of continental catastrophe to stir_up embers of hope . He has rejected America ' s &quot; Afro-pessimism &quot; and championed the emerging generation of African leaders and their commitment to democracy . &quot; Afro-realism , &quot; he calls it . He has also sounded a warning : This may be Africa ' s last chance . The vast energies spent on destructive political struggle must now weave the fisherman his nets . &quot; The world around Africa is fast coming_together . And this continent risks being the odd man out , &quot; Lake said in a speech in Ethiopia to the Organization of African Unity . By happenstance , Lake ' s nine-country , eight-day hopscotch across the continent with a delegation of military_officers , diplomats and scholars comes at a significant moment in African history and in Africa ' s post-Cold War relations with America . The trip had been long planned and often postponed . When Lake finally made his way to the continent last week , Ethiopia -- his first stop -- adopted a new democratic constitution that promises its fractious ethnic_groups the right to self-determination . He arrived in Rwanda as a new Parliament was seated . In Mozambique , the newly elected president appointed his government on the eve of Lake ' s arrival . Lake stopped in Burundi as moderates faced extremists in their long ethnic struggle for that small Central African_nation . In Zambia to the south , the national security adviser took the measure of a young and peacefully achieved , if imperfect , democracy . Also during his trip , Angola has wobbled on the unsteady legs of a Nov . 22 peace accord -- still skirmishing and still talking after 19 years of civil_war . &quot; End the hostilities once and for all , &quot; Lake urged the warring factions Monday , at the beginning of a two-day visit . &quot; The time has come_to match your words with actions. &quot; Lake plans to continue on to the western coastal nations of Benin and Ghana , other potential showcases of African progress . And he is to wind_up his trip on the far western edge of the continent in Senegal , noted for its stability . For all that , however , the American delegation has been_on the defensive . After a failed peacekeeping effort in Somalia and following the senseless horrors of Rwanda , the American public seems to have lost its stomach for Africa . The United Nations is stretched thin . New Republican leaders of Congress want less engagement here , not more . &quot; We recognize signs of hope , &quot; Lake said . &quot; But many African_nations are but one step away from crisis. &quot; Why should America care ? Because it is in the heart of Americans to care , said Lake . &quot; And we care because the great global challenges of tomorrow can be seen in the challenges facing Africa today. &quot; This theme of longing versus despair is not Lake ' s alone but also has been voiced along the way by scores of Africans . In Ethiopia , scholar Jalal Abdel Latil said his country ' s move away from authoritarianism &quot; is irreversible . They are dismantling the old order . The trouble is , nobody has a model for a new order. &quot; In Rwanda , where ethnic divisions are so powerfully deep that few people can be truly optimistic , Mache Nkongoli is vice_president of the new Parliament . There is no money for hotel_rooms to house representatives from out of town ; there is only one photocopying machine , and the rain still comes_through shell holes in the Parliament building . &quot; But the positive thing is that our representatives are here and ready to work , &quot; he said . In Zambia , a multi-party election in 1991 peacefully brought_down a 27-year ruler . But one election does not create a democracy . &quot; Our next election will be the hard one , &quot; said Foston Kakala , a Zambian democracy advocate . &quot; In 1991 , there was one common enemy . In 1996 , it will be more difficult. &quot; Even Lake ' s diversions have showed the two sides of Africa . One morning , his party flew_by helicopter to Moamba , Mozambique , where platoons of ex-soldiers are clearing anti-personnel mines , inch by painful inch , from the land . With the detonation of a string of freshly found Russian mines , the smell of cordite was still raw on the sweltering breezes . Six hours later , Lake drove to a Zambian wild game ranch outside Lusaka . With his field guide to birds , he correctly identified the bird on the Zambian currency as the fish_eagle . His party also discovered a nest of young pythons and a profusion of African antelope . And they watched the sun drop over the savanna , turning the sky the bright color of blood . White_House officials seemed to indicate that Lake ' s foray , one of several high-level Administration missions to Africa in recent months , is a prelude to a presidential visit to the fast-changing continent in 1995 . However , it has not been simple to determine where an American president should go , except for South_Africa . &quot; No matter what , Africa is at the bottom of America ' s priorities . And it ' s going_to stay there for a long_time , &quot; said Shawn H . McCormick , an Africa specialist who is traveling with Lake from the Washington , D.C. , Center for Strategic and International Studies . &quot; For it to move_up , something else would have to fall_behind . What would that be ? Europe ? Asia ? Latin_America ? Russia ? &quot; But it ' s still an exciting time here . After colonialism and since the Cold_War , now is the time Africans can decide for themselves what to do . The 1990s will be the decade when Africa defines its own future . You could argue it has no other choice. &quot; On this path , Africans feel an urgent dependence on America and the West , as much now as ever . In Mozambique , 71 % of the government budget comes from outside donors . In Zambia , the amount is almost as high . In Rwanda , the government has virtually no resources at all except what it is given . Some cynics , from both the West and Africa , see multi-party democracy as just a continuation of what happened during the Cold_War -- rich , domineering nations imposing their view of government by checkbook . And African leaders respond to please : The civic_leaders of the Zambian capital recently changed the name of Saddam Hussein Boulevard to Los Angeles Boulevard . So , naturally , African leaders are openly nervous about the American political mood . The Cold_War may have had room for corrupt and inept governments , but not this new lean-and-mean trans-global economic order . In Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , an African diplomat said he was impressed by the Clinton_Administration delegation . But he said to Lake , &quot; For all your goodwill and noble protestations , you may_not have the wherewithal to realize your ideals. &quot; Indeed , replied Lake . He said Africa should not &quot; over-read &quot; the results of the American congressional elections . &quot; We will continue to work with the leadership of the Republican_Party and with the Republican moderates who are dedicated to engagement in the world. &quot; But he added : &quot; We need to be able to show results , practical results . . . . In Africa , and elsewhere , the windows of opportunity can remain open for only so_long . . . . The warlords -- and , tragically , their people -- cannot always count_on an international safety net. &quot;</TEXT>
