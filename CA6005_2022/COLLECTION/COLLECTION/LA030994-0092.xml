   <HEADLINE> RULES AGAINST LENDING BIAS TOUGHENED BY GOVERNMENT ; BANKING : FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE EXPANDING BEYOND A RECENT FOCUS_ON MORTGAGES AND WILL NOW SCRUTINIZE OTHER LOANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a rare display of cooperation , 10 federal agencies , led by the Justice_Department , on Tuesday announced tough new guidelines to fight discrimination in loans to consumers and small businesses . All lenders -- from banks and savings and loans to finance_companies , credit_unions and credit_card companies -- will now be scrutinized to see if their overall lending patterns contain evidence of bias , federal_officials said . In effect , the federal agencies are expanding their aggressive approach far beyond a recent focus_on fighting bias in home mortgages . &quot; Ending discrimination in lending is one of the most important civil_rights issues facing this country , &quot; Atty . Gen . Janet Reno told a news_conference . The interagency program unveiled Tuesday will focus_on the so-called disparate treatment of borrowers , in which there may be no overt prejudicial policies and no intent to discriminate , but the outcome is the same . For example , if the rejection rate for blacks applying for credit is much higher than for whites in the same general income group , this could be a result of disparate treatment , officials say . The differing rejection rates should &quot; raise a red flag &quot; and cause a lending_institution to re-examine the way it does business , Comptroller_of_the_Currency Eugene Ludwig said at a news_conference . The policy statement adopted by the federal agencies gave two examples of lending practices that will not be tolerated and which lead to disparate impact : * Two minority borrowers asked about mortgage loans . They were given applications only for a fixed-rate mortgage and failed to qualify for the loan . Two non-minority borrowers with the same general income were told about both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgages and were given help in filling_out their ultimately successful application . * A loan officer rejected a loan_application by a woman with &quot; flaws in her credit report &quot; but approved applications by men with similar credit problems &quot; after working with them to provide satisfactory explanations. &quot; Consumer and advocacy groups generally welcomed the policy . &quot; It ' s long overdue and we ' re happy to see it , &quot; said Michelle Meier , counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union . &quot; The Clinton_Administration has shown a strong interest in aggressive enforcement of the civil_rights laws , &quot; she said . &quot; Today ' s statement was a breath of fresh air. &quot; Acorn , a coalition of neighborhood groups in 37 cities , was more cautious . &quot; It is about sending a message to industry , &quot; said Deepak Bhargava , the group ' s legislative director . &quot; But the substance of their statement is not terribly radical about efforts to achieve compliance . It ' s like smoke signals . It ' s not clear about telling the banks what they should and shouldn ' t do. &quot; * Most hidden discrimination occurs in small-business lending because loans are not standardized , Bhargava said . Mortgage loans , on the other hand , are packaged for resale to investors , and federal laws require public disclosure of application and rejection rates among various ethnic_groups . Henry G . Cisneros , secretary of housing_and_urban_development , who hosted the news_conference , said the participating agencies formed &quot; the most powerful team that can be assembled &quot; for the goal of guaranteeing &quot; fair lending to all Americans. &quot; Just by having the news_conference , there will be ripples throughout the financial services_industry , said Norman E . D ' Amours , chairman of the National Credit_Union Administration , one of the participants . Reno has already met with bankers to discuss their concerns about the newly aggressive policies . &quot; We are not asking people to make bad loans , but to be fair , &quot; she said . Many times , &quot; there is no racism involved , &quot; merely lenders ' ways of doing business . Beside the Justice_Department and HUD , the federal agencies involved in the effort are the Federal_Reserve_Board , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , Office of Thrift Supervision , National Credit_Union Administration , Office of the Comptroller_of_the_Currency , Federal Trade Commission , Federal Housing Finance Board and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight .</TEXT>
