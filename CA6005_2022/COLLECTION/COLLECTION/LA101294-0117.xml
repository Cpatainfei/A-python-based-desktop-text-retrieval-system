   <HEADLINE> STUDENT AID COMMISSION CHIEF QUITS ; EDUCATION : FEDERAL PRESSURE ON DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA PANEL FORCES HIS RESIGNATION . ACTION COMES AFTER U.S. SAYS STATE AGENCY HAD COLLECTED MILLIONS MORE THAN IT DESERVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under pressure from the federal_government to step_down , the executive_director of the embattled California Student Aid Commission resigned Tuesday , saying he was doing so to help restore the little-known state agency ' s sullied reputation . The resignation of Samuel M . Kipp III is the latest in a string of developments that has pitted the U.S. Department_of_Education against the commission , which administers millions of dollars in student loans in the state . The battle began last year when the federal agency conducted an audit and claimed that the student aid commission had collected millions of dollars more_than it deserved from the federal_government because it had overstated its portfolio of outstanding loans by $ 1.5 billion . The stakes went higher in August when the education_department demanded that the commission pay $ 62.6 million worth of defaulted student loans and that it fire its top administrators because of &quot; unprecedented &quot; mistakes in the handling of student loans over several years . It also ordered that the commission junk its $ 14-million computer_system , described by the education_department as &quot; muddled , convoluted and . . . archaic. &quot; At the time , the federal agency said that unless something was done to rectify the situation , the education_department &quot; will have no choice but to terminate &quot; its relationship with the commission and find someone else to administer the federally guaranteed student loan program in the state . Kipp , director of the agency for nine years , submitted his resignation in a letter to Commission Chairman Mike Carona . In it , he said that he wanted &quot; to do everything possible to assure that the commission prevails and successfully resolves its dispute with the Department of Education. &quot; Kipp was referring to a lawsuit filed_in September by the state_attorney general ' s office against the education_department , contesting the order to pay the $ 62.6 million . In the lawsuit , the attorney_general ' s office said the commission would suffer irreparable damage if it had to pay that money to the federal_government and called the demand &quot; arbitrary and capricious. &quot; In a statement by Carona after accepting the resignation , he praised Kipp for the &quot; myriad accomplishments of the agency under his leadership. &quot; Later , in a telephone_interview , Carona said Kipp ' s resignation fell_short_of the original demand that all_the high-ranking administrators leave the staff . But he said Kipp was clearly a target during the past year . &quot; It ' s clear the Department_of_Education wanted Sam ' s head , &quot; he said . &quot; He also took a lot of hits on the state level. &quot; Sean Walsh , Gov . Pete Wilson ' s press secretary , said he did not know of any pressure from the governor ' s office for Kipp to resign . The resignation brought quick response from Kathleen Brown , Wilson ' s opponent in the gubernatorial race . &quot; Like the Energizer bunny , Pete Wilson ' s financial scandals keep going and going and going , &quot; she said . &quot; For more_than a year , he has defended his commission and its executive_director . This occurred despite . . . the threat of a total federal pullout of our student loan program , jeopardizing billions of dollars of aid to middle-class students. &quot; Walsh said Brown ' s comments did not merit a response .</TEXT>
