   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; IN BELFAST STREETS , THE MOOD IS GLUM ; CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS ARE TOO AWARE OF WHAT SEPARATES THEM TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEW TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the cold , gray winter drizzle that makes West Belfast gloomier than usual , the whitewashed slogans on the dark stone_walls along the Falls Road stand_out : &quot; Support the Peace Process &quot; and &quot; Back the Peace Initiative. &quot; The upbeat messages in this heavily Roman_Catholic , republican area refer to the Dec . 15 Downing Street Declaration signed by British Prime_Minister John Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds in hopes of finding a way to end 25 years of sectarian violence in_troubled Northern_Ireland , also known as Ulster . The agreement was hailed by many as breaking new ground in the search for a negotiated solution to the longstanding struggle between Catholics and Protestants in Northern_Ireland -- a struggle that has claimed 3 # 100 lives since 1969 . It was hoped particularly that this might be the key to luring Sinn Fein to the bargaining table . Sinn Fein is the political arm of the_Irish Republican Army , which employs violence in its drive to see Ulster politically unified with the Republic_of_Ireland to the south . But in the fortresslike bars in The Falls , the mood is not optimistic . For despite their expressed desire for a peaceful existence , people here sense deeply the chasm that separates Protestant Unionists from Catholic republicans in this violence-prone , British-ruled corner of the world . &quot; I don ' t see how it ' s going_to work , &quot; said an unemployed lather in a working men ' s club . &quot; The ' Prods ' won ' t give us anything . It ' s all religious . that ' s the way it is . They like killing Catholics. &quot; Referring to a famous road in a predominantly Protestant section of town , he added : &quot; If I went_to the Shankill for a pint , I could be shot dead. &quot; The painted slogans supporting the peace initiative -- originally pushed by Gerry Adams , president of Sinn Fein , and John Hume , moderate Catholic leader of the Social Democratic and Labor_Party -- are sometimes draped in the orange , white and green flag of Ireland . But around the corner on Springfield Road , the red , white and blue Union_Jack flies over a British army barracks , encased with steel netting to ward_off grenade and mortar attacks . And less than half a mile away is Shankill Road , the Protestant Unionist area separated from its Falls neighbor by a metal fence as daunting as the Berlin Wall . There , a_few doors away from a building blown_up by the IRA in an October attack aimed at Protestant extremists , is another pub , Spartan and protected by a security barrier . Its patrons are equally glum about peace prospects . &quot; Outsiders don ' t seem to realize that we Protestants aren ' t Irish , &quot; said one solidly built customer . &quot; We ' re British and we want to remain British , not Irish . We ' ve been here for 400 years . We ' re going to stay. &quot; &quot; I think the_British have given too_much away to the IRA , &quot; added another . &quot; The IRA wants to stomp on the majority in Northern_Ireland . The British talking to the IRA makes_it look as if violence pays_off . They ought to take the kid_gloves off and deal with the IRA as terrorists. &quot; What was considered historic and hopeful about the December accord was that for the first time , London and Dublin cooperated closely in offering the IRA a place at a peace table . It followed secret contacts between the_British and at least some elements of the IRA . * London and Dublin apparently calculated theirs as a &quot; win-win &quot; offer : An IRA rejection could marginalize the organization both at_home and in the larger world community . As part of the December agreement , the_British also declared themselves willing to leave the fate of Northern_Ireland to its inhabitants in a freely determined choice . The mostly Catholic Irish agreed to amend their republic ' s constitution to satisfy Ulster Protestants in the event of unification . Talks were_due to begin as soon as all parties agreed , but Sinn Fein has delayed a firm response . The party ' s Gerry Adams insists that before he agrees to sit_down at any bargaining table , the Downing Street Declaration needs &quot; clarification. &quot; Major says the declaration is already clear and that further conversation is tantamount_to negotiation , which is not supposed to take_place under the December agreement until after a three-month cease-fire . Hume , meanwhile , says Major should not object to offering a clarification to Adams if that would get the peace process moving . &quot; Sometimes it sounds like abstruse theological arguments in early Christendom , &quot; said one observer . The problem is that the language in the December declaration is purposely ambiguous . It is an attempt to square the Ulster circle by offering republican militants enough to bring them to the table without outraging their equally militant Unionist counterparts . The critical sentence in the document reads : &quot; The British government agrees that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone , by agreement between the two parts respectively , to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent , freely and currently given , North and South. &quot; * This , the_British claim , fully protects the Protestant Unionists ' majority rights in Northern_Ireland because any change could only come_about with their consent . &quot; If this is the case , &quot; commented one veteran observer here , &quot; there doesn ' t then seem to be much in it for the IRA -- which has been fighting for years for a united Ireland. &quot; And Adams ' lately stated position is : &quot; Democracy demands that Britain recognizes the right of the_Irish people to determine our own future in our own interests and on our own terms. &quot; He refers to an islandwide vote_in which Ulster Protestants would have a minority voice ; Northern_Ireland would cease to exist as a separate political entity . In the cramped , two-story party offices in West Belfast , Sinn Fein ' s national chairperson , Tom Hartley , 49 , defended Adams ' insistence on clarification . &quot; We want to see if there ' s the dynamic to move forward , &quot; the Belfast city councilor said . &quot; If Britain gives the Unionists a veto , then they won ' t move because they don ' t have to move . &quot; We believe the_British should get ready for a negotiating process leading to a united Ireland. &quot; While that might well lead to a period of conflict , Hartley said , the_British ultimately have the economic and military resources to force the Protestants to go_along , Hartley added : &quot; Why shouldn ' t John Major and Gerry Adams talk ? I have a sense that age-old conflicts can be moved with negotiations , so I am a bit optimistic . We are in a new situation , a period of change. &quot; But many observers wonder whether the bearded Adams can bring along the so-called &quot; hard men &quot; in the IRA if they are being asked to give_up violence -- which they see as their key bargaining_chip -- in exchange for anything less than an immediately united Ireland . A London analyst with connections in Ulster says that attempting to discern IRA thinking is like deciphering the Kremlin at the height of the Cold_War . However , he ventures : &quot; Suppose only 45 ' hard men ' in the IRA don ' t go_along . They could cause a lot of damage and could effectively ruin any effort to bring_in Sinn Fein because ( the party ) would be blamed for not stopping violence. &quot; And another official laments : &quot; Sinn Fein met with IRA ' hard men ' from prison during the Christmas holiday amnesty . The problem is that when any of the ' hard men ' objects to negotiation and compromise , everyone else gets queasy about disputing them . &quot; The black joke is that in Britain , if you show courage by standing_up to be counted , you get the OBE , Order of the_British Empire ; but among the paramilitaries , in standing_up , you also get an OBE , One Behind the Ear. &quot; For their part , the Protestant Unionists also fret over the London peace declaration . They see it as the first_step in a British sellout . The Rev . Ian Paisley , militant leader of the extremist Democratic Unionist Party , has launched a series of appearances around the province warning against any talks with Sinn Fein , an organization he says &quot; has put ( itself ) out forever . In no set of circumstances will I sit_down with men whose hands are stained with blood. &quot; The cautious James Molyneaux heads the moderate Ulster Unionist Party , with nine seats in the_British House of Commons to Paisley ' s three , but he too is leery of talks that could lead to Ulster being subsumed by the Republic_of_Ireland . * Molyneaux ' s up-and-coming deputy , Parliament member David Trimble , says the Major government has already gone too far cosseting Sinn Fein . &quot; It has put itself in the rather embarrassing position where it has been acting like a supplicant begging this squalid little terrorist group to be nice to it , &quot; he said . &quot; The government should make_it clear that the only thing to do now is to continue the political process and to address the Sinn Fein-IRA as a security problem. &quot; Ulster Unionists wish to remain part of Britain , not the least because Northern_Ireland is_on the receiving end of a $ 3.5-billion annual subsidy from London . And it is difficult to envisage Major , beset by his many political woes , agreeing to a deal that would cast Ulster adrift -- however popular that might prove to the large_number of Britons who would like to wash their hands of the whole mess . But if Britain should ever decide to remove the troops it has stationed in Northern_Ireland since 1969 -- now 20 # 000 -- and let the republicans and Unionists sort things out among themselves , most military experts believe that the Protestants are in a far stronger position . In Northern_Ireland , they outnumber the Catholics by about 950 # 000 to 600 # 000 although the demographics are moving_in favor of the Catholics . But the conventional wisdom in Irish-oriented bars in New York , Boston and Chicago -- that the Northern_Ireland Catholics together with forces from the republic would roll_up the Protestants -- overlooks some plain military facts . &quot; The Protestants have a long martial history , &quot; points_out a British military historian . &quot; They lost a full division at the Somme in World_War I , and they have contributed soldiers and many generals to the_British army . They are_better trained and disciplined than their potential Irish opponents. &quot; And an Ulster man , wounded in Belfast as a serviceman in the_British army , claims : &quot; We have thousands and thousands of men who have served in the army , the Ulster Defense Regiment , the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Territorial_Army ( National_Guard ) . They are trained in the use of heavy_weapons , artillery , mortars , and most of them own light weapons . . . . &quot; The IRA are amateur guerrillas . They can set_off their bombs and assassinate individuals , but they couldn ' t fight a proper war , even with the help of the_Irish army . I would have no qualms about killing an IRA man . And there are many_more here like me. &quot; Like Britain , the Dublin government has outlawed the IRA , but it fears that any major conflict in Northern_Ireland could spread quickly , putting great pressure on it to send troops to aid beleaguered Catholics . Most believe a civil_war will be avoided , mainly because that would create a nightmare for the_British . * For now , Belfast , with freshly painted facades and new buildings , presents a much improved appearance from the worst days of what is euphemistically known here as &quot; the troubles. &quot; Butsome complain that behind the facade , business owners must pay_off both republican and Unionist paramilitaries . As one taxi driver put it : &quot; Belfast is like Chicago in the old days . Every business has to pay protection , and the funny thing is you can write it off your income_tax &quot; as consultancy fees , commissions or some_other ruse . Despite skepticism over the peace process in many quarters , particularly the hard-scrabble areas of The Falls and The Shankill , officials and commentators hold_out more_than a ray of hope . &quot; A couple of years ago , you could not see the Sinn Fein even talking to the_British government , &quot; said one official in Belfast . &quot; that ' s a first . The idea is to bring_in the_Irish government in a limited way to show that Catholic rights are protected . The British seem prepared to accept that. &quot; No one knows or even predicts what the talks might lead to , with or without Sinn Fein . But the hope of people like Hume is that self-rule would be returned to Northern_Ireland with the Catholics given a &quot; weighted &quot; minority so they would have representation in an Ulster assembly . ( From 1921 to 1972 , Northern_Ireland had its own regional government based at Stormont Castle just northeast of Belfast . That government was suspended in 1972 and replaced by direct rule from London. ) In Hume ' s view , once Protestant Unionists get used to the idea of having political input by Ireland ' s government , an accommodation can slowly proceed , with closer ties developed over the years and leading eventually to a united Ireland . Clearly , an end to the violence in Ulster will depend_on compromise . And as one longtime observer here puts it : &quot; Despite all_the suffering , the pain level has never been sufficiently high to make compromise possible. &quot; Still , said one neutral official following the process : &quot; This is a hope , only a hope . But it is probably the best hope we have had in a long time. &quot; THE PLAYERS Prime_Minister John Major BRITAIN : Would like to unload responsibilities in Northern_Ireland , where it spends billions and stations 20 # 000 troops . But if the troops withdraw , it fears civil_war and being accused of abandoning the 1 million Protestants who consider themselves Britons . * Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds IRELAND : Would like a united island of Ireland but is not willing to go_to_war for it . It seeks to assure skeptical Protestants that their traditions would be respected despite its Roman Catholic-influenced laws such_as bans on divorce and abortion . * Rev . Ian Paisley PROTESTANT UNIONISTS : Basically , they want to remain a part of Britain . Barring that , they are prepared to set_up their own state rather than be subsumed by Ireland . Paisley is one of their spokesmen . * Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams SINN FEIN / IRA : Totally dedicated to a united Ireland . They believe the Protestant majority in Ulster must accede_to becoming a protected minority on the reunited island . * SDLP leader John Hume MODERATE CATHOLIC REPUBLICANS : Mainly , the Social Democratic and Labor_Party , which wants to see Ireland united through a gradual , peaceful process . They are outflanked by extremists on both sides . THE ' TROUBLES ' IN NORTHERN_IRELAND The wounds that Britain and Ireland are trying to heal are ancient . Some key events : * 1608 -- Scottish and English Protestants colonize areas of Ulster , confiscating land from the mostly Roman_Catholic Irish . Many trace the present Northern Irish conflict to this event . * 1690 -- Battle of the Boyne . At Dublin , Protestant William III defeats an attempt by Catholic King James_II to win_back the_English throne . Penal Laws are passed to keep Irish Catholics powerless . * 1782 -- Britain recognizes an independent Irish Parliament . But Catholics may_not hold office . * 1798 -- The Irish Rebellion . Unsuccessful . Led by an Irish Protestant , it is nonetheless supported by Catholic France , reviving anti-Catholic sentiment . * 1800 -- Britain abolishes the_Irish Parliament and unites Ireland and Britain in a United Kingdom with one Parliament . * 1905 -- Sinn Fein ( We Ourselves ) is organized among Irish Catholics to fight for independence . * 1916 -- The Easter Rebellion against British rule breaks_out in Dublin . It is repressed by British forces , and its leaders are executed . * 1919 -- Irish members of the_British Parliament establish their own Parliament in Dublin and declare Ireland ' s independence . Civil war breaks_out , and the_Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) is formed . * 1922 -- An Irish_Free_State , mostly populated by Roman_Catholics , is established within the_British Empire . Meanwhile , the six northern counties , mostly Protestant , remain part of Britain proper . * 1949 -- Ireland becomes the Republic_of_Ireland , leaving the_British Commonwealth . * March , 1972 -- Britain disbands the Protestant-dominated Parliament of Northern_Ireland , instituting direct rule by Britain . * July , 1972 -- Bloody Friday . Eleven people are killed by 26 IRA bombs in Belfast . * 1980s -- Bobby Sands , a British Parliament member , is among 10 IRA inmates at Maze prison who die during a hunger_strike protesting conditions and demanding political-prisoner status . IRA launches bomb attacks , including one in 1984 that barely misses Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher . * 1985 -- Anglo-Irish Agreement gives Ireland a say in Northern_Ireland affairs in return for cooperation in combatting terrorism . * Dec . 15 , 1993 -- Britain and Ireland invite Sinn Fein to join negotiations for a united Ireland , on condition that violence stops in Northern_Ireland . But violence continues , and no agreement is reached . Sources : Baedeker ' s Ireland , 1992 ed. ; Reuters news service . Compiled by Times researcher JANET LUNDBLAD</TEXT>
