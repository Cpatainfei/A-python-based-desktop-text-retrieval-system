   <HEADLINE> ARGENTINA BLOCKS TESTIMONY IN ITALIAN RIGHTS HEARINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Carlos Saul Menem ' s administration succeeded Wednesday in blocking legal testimony on the disappearances of 82 Italian citizens in Argentina while this country was under military rule . A judge and a prosecutor from Italy stirred_up a hornet ' s nest here after arriving Feb . 13 to hear testimony on the disappearances.Military authorities made_it known that they were &quot; concerned and irritated &quot; over the Italian proceedings . Past and present military_personnel , including former presidents of governing juntas , are implicated in the disappearances and could be tried in absentia in Italy . Under military pressure , Menem spoke out against the hearings , putting himself in the middle of revived controversy over past human_rights violations . Menem ' s justice minister initiated a request for an injunction to prevent the hearings . Human_rights groups protested . Argentina ' s federal_court of appeals ruled Wednesday that the_matter is outside the jurisdiction of a lower federal judge who had agreed to aid the Italians in hearing the witnesses . If the judge disputes the ruling , the_matter of jurisdiction may be decided by the Supreme Court , but that could take years . Argentine investigations have documented the disappearances of more_than 9 # 000 civilians in the so-called &quot; dirty war &quot; between security_forces and leftists during the 1976-83 regime . Military pressure , including a series of revolts , resulted in amnesties and pardons for hundreds of officers charged with violating human_rights . Before the end of the regime , in 1982 , Italian consulates in Argentina had received complaints that more_than 600 Italian citizens were among those who had disappeared .</TEXT>
