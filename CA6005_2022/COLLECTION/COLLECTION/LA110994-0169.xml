   <HEADLINE> BITTERLY FOUGHT SENATE_RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s bruising and costly U.S. Senate contest between Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington was coming_down to the wire early today as results indicated that the race was still too close to call . Feinstein , who was outspent more_than 2 to 1 in the most expensive congressional race in U.S. history , appeared shortly after midnight at her election party in San Francisco ' s Fairmont Hotel . She told supporters that the final results would probably not be known until this morning . She indicated she had planned to talk_about her future plans , but decided to wait . &quot; I ' m not going_to do this tonight because obviously we need to know what these election results are , &quot; she said as the audience chanted , &quot; Dianne ! Dianne ! &quot; &quot; But I want you to be encouraged , &quot; she said . &quot; Because I have worked hard for the people of California. &quot; Hadley Roff , chief of Feinstein ' s staff in California , said early today that it is possible that the race could hang_in the balance for days while absentee_ballots turned_in at the polls Tuesday are counted . Caren Daniels-Meade , a spokeswoman for the secretary_of_state ' s office , said there may be 500 # 000 to 700 # 000 uncounted ballots , most of them absentee_ballots . &quot; There are a number of races at this point_in_time that appear to be too close to call. &quot; Huffington appeared with his supporters at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Orange County about 11:15 p.m. &quot; I wanted to come_down because I didn ' t want all_of you to go_home , &quot; he told a cheering crowd that waved Huffington placards . &quot; we ' ll be back_down again later tonight . . . . It is clear , watching what is happening across the country , that the Republicans are having an unbelievable victory . And what we want to do_in California tonight is to add_to that victory. &quot; Earlier , when Huffington spoke briefly with reporters , he was asked if the bumpy campaign was worth it . &quot; It ' s been very worth it , &quot; the candidate answered . &quot; All of us are_on this planet to do_good for somebody. &quot; Huffington ' s wife , Arianna , an internationally known author , also smiled and said of the campaign : &quot; Maybe there ' s a book in it . I ' m keeping notes. &quot; Feinstein , who rode a Democratic momentum into office in 1992 , the so-called &quot; Year of the Woman , &quot; found herself two years later paddling against a powerful political current . Feinstein ran a campaign about the benefits of government that contrasted with the hostile mood responsible_for the historic gains in Congress for Republicans . In addition , political observers said Feinstein suffered from the poor showing by Democratic colleague Kathleen Brown in the governor ' s race , and she was hurt by her opposition to Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration initiative . Huffington , however , spent so_much of the campaign attacking Feinstein that polls indicated he never made a strong connection with voters . In addition , his campaign was rocked by press stories critical of his business background , his wife ' s unconventional religious history and , most recently , his admission that he employed an illegal immigrant in violation of federal law . The two Senate candidates combined to spend more_than $ 41 million on the race , shattering a 10-year record of $ 26 million set by North Carolina Sen . Jesse A . Helms and his opponent . Huffington , whose fortune comes from the 1990 sale of his family ' s Texas oil and gas_company , accounted_for almost $ 30 million , nearly double the most ever spent by a non-presidential candidate . Because of his money , Huffington turned the California race into a high-stakes cliffhanger after it had been considered by most Washington insiders to be one of the surest Democratic bets in the country . Feinstein was an early favorite because she was a veteran of two consecutive statewide campaigns and , in polls , she was rated the most popular politician in California . But after Huffington spent nearly $ 6 million on television advertising during the spring , most of it attacking Feinstein ' s record in the Senate , the incumbent ' s lead shrank_from 30 % in a Times Poll in March to single digits by the June 7 primary . The developments set_off alarms at the White_House because Huffington ' s primary criticism of Feinstein last spring was her vote for President Clinton ' s 1993 economic package . By late May , Feinstein had also quietly dropped her name from a list of senators backing the President ' s health_care plan . Still , Feinstein maintained a cautious alliance with the President throughout her campaign . Clinton appeared four times with Feinstein . In June , just days after the polls found the race tightening , Feinstein responded with her first television commercials . But after a summer-long exchange of high-priced attack ads , the polls did not budge . As a result , both campaigns entered the crucial fall period still locked_in a close race and having little hope of straying from their attack strategies . The predictable result was that voters grew to dislike both candidates . Feinstein ' s favorable rating fell below that for Gov . Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown . And in a Times Poll just more_than a week ago , barely a quarter of respondents said they liked Huffington . The last week of the campaign became one of the most acrimonious , with disclosures that Huffington employed an illegal immigrant nanny for more_than four years and that the work visa for Feinstein ' s former Guatemalan housekeeper expired while the woman was still employed . The illegal immigrant debate dominated the final days of the race as both candidates broadcast commercials about the other ' s case . Circumstances in the two cases were different , though . Huffington acknowledged that he violated federal law by employing the nanny up until last year . His problem was made more embarrassing because he strongly supported Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that would cut most health and education benefits to illegal immigrants . Feinstein opposed the initiative . In Feinstein ' s case , immigration officials confirmed Friday that a housekeeper she employed a decade ago had a visa to be in the country legally only if she worked_at the Guatemalan Consulate -- not in a private home . Even that permission expired a year after the woman began working for Feinstein in 1980 , they said . Feinstein maintained , however , that she did not violate federal law because there was no rule against employing an illegal immigrant until 1986 . Throughout the race , name-calling and accusations dominated the contest on television . On the campaign trail , however , the stump_speeches revealed a striking philosophical choice between two very different candidates . Feinstein championed the performance of government , highlighting everything from farm subsidies to disaster relief , crime control and small business incentives . Huffington was almost the opposite , boasting to audiences that he votes against most appropriations_bills and many government regulations and opposed any new taxes .</TEXT>
