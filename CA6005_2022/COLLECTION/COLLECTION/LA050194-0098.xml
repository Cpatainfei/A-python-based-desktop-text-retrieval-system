   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A SEASICK SAILOR ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; If there ' s any one thing in the world that will make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited , it is to have his stomach behave itself , the first day at_sea , when nearly all his comrades are seasick , &quot; Mark Twain wrote in &quot; Innocents Abroad. &quot; Fear of seasickness is one of the major excuses cited for not taking a cruise . Although fewer than 5 % of the passengers on any cruise complain of motion-sickness symptoms , it ' s still annoying when it happens . Anyone worrying about mal_de_mer can plan ahead for smoother seas by carefully selecting a ship , itinerary , travel season and even cabin location . If your previous seagoing experience is limited to sailboats , fishing_boats or a hitch in the U.S. Navy , the stability of modern cruise_ships may surprise you . Virtually all cruise_ships today are equipped with retractable fin stabilizers that project underwater from each side of the ship to counteract any side-to-side rolling motion . It ' s generally estimated that they cut_out 90 % of the roll . But even most modern stabilizers are not_able to control pitching ( the up-and-down motion of the ship ' s bow ) , so the captain must do his utmost to avoid going_into bad_weather and heavy seas . At least one ship -- the futuristic 354-passenger Radisson Diamond , with its unique twin hulls -- promises considerably less pitching and rolling than a conventional single-hull ship . It claims to have only 20 % of the roll of a mono-hull cruise_ship and 10 % of the noise and vibration levels . Diamond Cruise Line says in its brochure that its innovative SWATH ( Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull ) design can &quot; virtually negate the effects of the sea &quot; because of its computer-controlled inboard fin stabilizers and the relatively narrow hull area it has in contact with the waves . When stabilizers are inboard rather than outboard , they aid in counteracting pitch as well as roll . Pitch and heave are also reduced because water is funneled between the two pontoons . When we took the Radisson Diamond ' s inaugural May , 1992 , sailing in the_English Channel , that body_of_water was so uncharacteristically smooth that we could hardly tell when the ship was moving and when it was alongside the dock . Still , all_the of the line ' s claims seemed to hold true . Another revolutionary design feature in the sail-cruise vessels of Windstar Cruises and Club Med Cruises are computer-trimmed and operated sails that keep the ships at an even keel under sail , with heeling well under 6 % . * Ships with a deeper draft ( the measurement from the vessel ' s waterline to the lowest point of its keel ) usually perform better in rough seas than ships with shallow drafts . Norwegian Cruise Line ' s Norway , for example , has a 35-foot draft , whereas the Carnival Line ' s megaliners Fantasy , Ecstasy and Sensation , which carry nearly the same number of passengers and gross registered tonnage , like most recently built vessels have 25-foot drafts . Cabin location can also make a difference in how much ship motion you feel . Accommodations that are located on a lower deck amidships ( about halfway between bow and stern ) offer a more stable ride than the higher-priced sun_deck and promenade_deck locations . Book a cabin too close to the ship ' s bow or stern and you may feel every swell . Destination and itineraries can make a big difference for passengers concerned about seasickness . Land is always in_sight and waters are calm is such sheltered waters as Alaska ' s Inside Passage or the great rivers of the world . Conversely , in areas where two seas meet -- Cabo San Lucas , Mexico , for instance , where the Sea of Cortez meets the Pacific_Ocean ; South_Africa ' s Cape_of_Good_Hope , or South_America ' s Cape Horne -- the water can really be stirred_up . The same is true in regions where currents are powerful ( with a speed greater than 0.8 knots an hour ) . Examples are the Bering Strait , the Java and Solomon seas , the South Indian_Ocean and Bay_of_Bengal , the French-Spanish Bay of Biscay , around the Spitsbergen and Falkland island groups , and along the southern tip of Africa . Finally , some seas and seasons are worse than others for passengers who fear seasickness . Capt . Konstantinos Skordos , master of Classical Cruises ' Aurora II and a longtime cargo captain , says summertime generally offers the best cruising weather , especially in the Mediterranean ; &quot; but the Aegean can be rough sometimes in summer. &quot; His favorite smooth winter waters are between Costa Rica and Panama , where &quot; there ' s always good_weather in winter , &quot; and he gives high marks to Mexico ' s sheltered Sea of Cortez . However , he noted , Scotland ' s west coast and Shetland Islands can have rough seas even in summer . In our experience -- about 175 cruises in 15 years -- we ' ve had a handful of memorably rough voyages . They have included an April crossing on the North Atlantic ; Cape Horn and the Drake Passage , south of South_America , on an Antarctic sailing in January ; a November sailing along the coast of West Africa , especially around the border of Namibia and South_Africa ; the South_China_Sea , and the seas around Nome , Alaska , anytime . Even a short three- or four-day cruise out of Los Angeles south to Ensenada , Mexico , especially in winter , can involve several hours of rough seas on the northbound return . We recall with pleasure the smooth seas aboard most Caribbean cruises and all Alaska cruises -- except for the Nome area , where only a_few expedition vessels sail . * After all_the advance planning , if mal_de_mer strikes anway , there are several possible remedies : Some travelers swear by knit , bracelet-like bands , worn around both wrists , which exert pressure on acupressure points to relieve symptoms of nausea . Travel stores , variety stores and large drugstores usually carry them under such brand names as Sea Band or Travel Garde . Non-prescription antihistamine remedies , such_as Dramamine , can be taken one or two hours before sailing but do cause drowsiness . Some ship doctors recommend a Dramamine injection , which usually acts faster than an ingested tablet , for a sudden or severe onset of seasickness . The most commonly used device is the Transderm Scop , a Band-Aid-like patch -- applied behind the ear -- which appears more innocuous than it really is . Available only by prescription , the patch contains scopolamine ; according to printed inserts , it is not recommended for pregnant women or people with glaucoma , kidney or liver ailments , obstructions of the stomach or intestines , urinary or bladder obstructions , skin allergies or skin reactions to drugs . Common side_effects of the Transderm Scop include a dry mouth and , less frequently , drowsiness or a temporary blurring of vision . Very infrequently , disorientation , memory disturbances and hallucinations may occur , particularly among older people , according to a spokesman for its manufacturer , CIBA-GEIGY . He also warned that people using the drug should not drink alcohol but quench their thirst instead with water or soft_drinks . Staying_on deck in the fresh air will generally alleviate symptoms more quickly than lying_down indoors , and many passengers say looking_at the horizon seems to help . If all else fails , one sure way to get_rid_of the seasickness problem is to grow older . Young people are much more sensitive to motion_sickness than older people . * Classical Cruises ' Aurora II , the subject of the April 17 Cruise Views column , was unexpectedly sold by its German owners to shipping interests in the Far East , according to Classical ' s president , Jamie Rosen . The Aurora II will continue its chartered sailings for Classical as scheduled through August , after which autumn sailings will be transferred to the 64-passenger French motor-sailing yacht , Le Ponant .</TEXT>
