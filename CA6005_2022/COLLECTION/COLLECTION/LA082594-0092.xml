   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENING : NEGLECT FOR THE WORLD KILLS THE OASIS OF HAUNTING ' GARDEN '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cinematography for Vittorio De Sica ' s &quot; The Garden of the Finzi-Continis &quot; looks honey-dipped , with its golden colors and summery warmth . The mansion and lush grounds of the Finzi-Contini family are idyllic , the perfect world for all seasons . What ' s going_on outside the iron gates , however , isn ' t so nice . It ' s 1938 , the place is Mussolini ' s Italy , and anti-Semitism is becoming the norm . The Finzi-Continis , an aristocratic , very wealthy Jewish family , ignore the truth for as long as they can in the life they ' ve created in their garden . The movie -- which won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1971 and screens tonight as the finale in the Bowers Museum ' s Italian film series -- is quietly absorbing because De Sica , never a flamboyant director at his peak , is so deliberate . The creamy , pristine imagery ( thanks to celebrated cameraman Ennio Guarnieri ) makes_a_point -- when the cinematography becomes harsher at the film ' s end ( and the garden is replaced by a grim detention center ) -- we see reality fall like a heavy boot . Until then , though , it ' s mostly lovely , with the turbulence of fascism rising_up , but only from a distance . The pretty facade of &quot; The Garden of the Finzi-Continis &quot; continues with De Sica ' s characters , mostly a group of Jewish college_students with patrician features and graceful bodies . They ' re glamorous in their nonchalance . Micol ( Dominique Sanda ) , Giorgio ( Lino Capolicchio ) , Alberto ( Helmut Berger ) and Malnate ( Fabio Testi ) are almost annoyingly attractive , but De Sica wants the symbolism to be clear . It can be too obvious , but the corrupting of their lives is still affecting as the movie goes nimbly down a tragic path . The story is primarily told by Giorgio , a local boy whose love since childhood for the remote Micol , the only daughter in the Finzi-Contini clan , is rebuffed . Her passionate relationship with Malnate ( who is not Jewish ) and what happens to her ill brother , Alberto , are the key human events in &quot; The Garden of the Finzi-Continis. &quot; But it ' s really the loss of innocence as Hitler ' s &quot; racial purity &quot; perversions take_hold that blanches everything . It changes the lives of all_the students who visit the Finzi-Continis for tennis and talk , but the family seems strangely out of the loop . They feel they can continue their isolation , and that naivete makes their fall even more precipitous . The movie is important as a sign post of De Sica ' s career . After a successful run as a silent matinee_idol during the 1920s , De Sica turned serious and became one of the vanguards of the neo-realist movement in Italy . He made acknowledged classics such_as &quot; Shoeshine &quot; and &quot; The Bicycle Thief &quot; during the ' 40s . Audiences accepted these intentionally unsophisticated pictures as testaments to their own lives , left unsure after the war . But in the ' 50s they wanted to forget , and more entertaining movies sold tickets . De Sica responded by directing almost exclusively more commercial films , finding success in another way . But with &quot; The Garden of the Finzi-Continis , &quot; De Sica returned to his neo-realist inspirations . The movie is far more polished than his earlier , grittier work , but the inspirations are the same . He once again explores human character against a backdrop of social and personal confusion . * What : Vittorio De Sica ' s &quot; The Garden of the Finzi-Continis. &quot; * When : Today , Aug . 25 , at 7:30 p.m. * Where : Bowers Museum , 2002 N .
