   <HEADLINE> NEW HOPE FOR GERONIMO PRATT ; LEGAL SYSTEM : THE FORMER BLACK PANTHER HAS SPENT 22 YEARS IN PRISON FOR A MURDER HE SAYS HE DIDN ' T COMMIT . NOW A CRUSADING LAY MINISTER HAS PERSUADED PROSECUTORS TO RE-EXAMINE THE CASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He has tried_for parole 12 times -- and been denied . Amnesty International has tried to win him a new trial . Political luminaries and even one of the jurors who convicted him say he deserves another chance . But Elmer ( Geronimo ) Pratt ' s best hope for freedom may have finally arrived in the person of a crusading clergyman who specializes in exonerating the &quot; convicted innocent. &quot; Lay minister Jim McCloskey is behind this week ' s decision by the Los Angeles County district_attorney to re-examine a case against the former Black Panther Party leader , who has been imprisoned 22 years for murder . McCloskey , whose New Jersey-based Centurion Ministries acts_as a private_detective service in selected death_penalty and life sentence cases , has conducted his own investigation into the case against Pratt . In a detailed report turned_over to Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , McCloskey said he became convinced that Pratt had nothing whatsoever to do with killing Carolyn Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis_court and wounding her husband in 1968 during an $ 18 robbery . Pratt , 46 , a decorated Vietnam_War veteran , is serving a life sentence for the slaying , but has always maintained his innocence . This week , Garcetti ' s office confirmed that the Pratt case is under review as a result of new evidence , but would not elaborate . In addition to McCloskey , Garcetti has been urged in recent months to review the case by one of the jurors who convicted Pratt , as well as by U.S. Reps . Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) , Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) and others . Through the years , other individuals and organizations , including the human_rights group Amnesty International , have called_for a new trial for Pratt . There had been little response from authorities until McCloskey entered the picture with his 13-year-old Centurion Ministries . The ministry gained national attention in 1992 , when McCloskey ' s work freed Clarence Chance and Benny Powell , two Los Angeles men who were wrongfully convicted of the murder of a sheriff ' s deputy and spent 17 years behind bars . McCloskey also is credited with freeing 10 other convicted people around the country . He told The Times last week that he recently met with Los Angeles prosecutors about the Pratt case , which has been in and out of the court system for nearly two decades . Appeals have been consistently denied and attempts to get the case reopened on the grounds that key evidence was not presented at Pratt ' s trial have been unsuccessful . Pratt , who spent his first eight years in prison in solitary confinement -- illegally , a jury later determined -- was denied parole for the 12th time last year . Stuart Hanlon , a San Francisco lawyer who has represented Pratt for 15 years and who contacted McCloskey after learning of the Chance and Powell case , said McCloskey ' s findings are significant given other evidence that has been unearthed over the years . The new evidence , he said , further discredits the prosecution ' s main witness and provides other suspects for the killing . Hanlon said he is heartened by the new review of the case . Pratt arrived in Los Angeles from his native Louisiana three months before the Olsen shooting . At the time , he was a 21-year-old recruit in the Los Angeles branch of the Panthers . In 1970 , when he was arrested in the Olsen slaying , he had moved_up the party ranks and was an official of a faction headed by Eldridge Cleaver . Pratt has insisted for years that he was a victim of COINTELPRO , a controversial FBI program that was designed to covertly disrupt and create dissension within politically radical groups of the 1960s and ' 70s , such_as the Black Panthers . Critics of the program also have also accused it of using unethical tactics to undermine the credibility of prominent radicals . Pratt maintains that he was in Oakland at the time of the Santa Monica shooting , which McCloskey and Hanlon say is confirmed by lawyers who say they have seen FBI wiretap transcripts of a call Pratt made from Oakland three hours before Olsen was killed . In addition , prominent former Black Panthers , including Bobby Seale and David Hilliard , have recently signed affidavits saying Pratt was in Oakland at the time of the murder . Seale and Hilliard were feuding with Pratt in 1972 and would not testify on his behalf at his trial . According to Hanlon , the most significant pieces of new evidence uncovered by McCloskey are affidavits from four people who say two other men , now dead , confessed to them that they had killed Olsen and wounded her husband . McCloskey ' s report also includes FBI memos saying the key witness against Pratt , a former sheriff ' s deputy turned Panther named Julius Butler , was providing information to the agency before he accused Pratt of the Olsen killing . That was withheld from Pratt ' s defense_lawyer and the jury in the case , McCloskey contends . Butler is currently an official of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles and did not return several calls to his church office . During Pratt ' s trial , Butler strongly denied cooperating with the FBI , but documents made public by the agency in the early 1980s indicate that he provided information . McCloskey also obtained statements from two former police_officers who say Butler had contact with the FBI for months before he accused Pratt of the Olsen killing . &quot; There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the jury would never have convicted Mr. Pratt had we known any of these facts , &quot; Hamilton wrote . Superior_Court Judge Richard Kalustian , who as a deputy district_attorney was Pratt ' s chief prosecutor , would not comment Tuesday , saying he had no facts upon which to base a statement .</TEXT>
