   <HEADLINE> A STUNNED COMMUNITY MOURNS ; HYPERBARIC CHAMBER NOT USED IN BATTLE FOR LAKIN ' S LIFE ; MEDICINE : DOCTOR QUESTIONS WHY OXYGEN TREATMENT WAS NOT UTILIZED . HOSPITAL OFFICIAL , HONORING FAMILY ' S REQUEST FOR PRIVACY , WILL NOT COMMENT ON DETAILS OF THE CASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A medical expert Monday questioned why doctors never exposed Ventura County ' s community_college chief , dying from a &quot; flesh-eating bacteria &quot; infection , to one of medicine ' s primary defenses against the condition : pure oxygen treatments in a pressurized chamber . Thomas G . Lakin , 50 , chancellor of the Ventura County Community_College District , died Sunday at Los Robles Regional Medical_Center in Thousand Oaks after a 24-hour medical battle to save his life . That battle included amputating one of Lakin ' s legs , but no visits to the hyperbaric_chamber used on other patients suffering from the virulent infection . J . B . Wilmeth , the medical director of the hyperbaric unit at Los Robles , said he only learned of Lakin ' s case through a reporter . Though he and the unit ' s staff are_on emergency call 24 hours a day , he said no one in the unit was informed by hospital staff that a patient with the condition , necrotizing fasciitis , had been admitted . Typically , he said , patients with the disease are put into the chamber , where doses of oxygen are administered to kill the bacteria and stop it from spreading . &quot; It ' s a little bit shocking that someone could die from that ailment without being sent to our hyperbaric unit , &quot; Wilmeth said when he learned of Lakin ' s death Sunday night . * On Monday , Wilmeth said Lakin ' s files have not been made available to him , due_to the family ' s request for privacy . &quot; I feel bad about this fellow , &quot; he said . &quot; I felt bad that we weren ' t called . At present , we don ' t know why . It all depends_on what the circumstances were , which I ' m not privy too . &quot; I sure would love to know what happened , but I don ' t think I ' m going_to find_out any time soon , &quot; he added . &quot; One wonders why , you know , a young_man like that . One wonders why the hyperbaric_chamber wasn ' t considered. &quot; At the request of the Lakin family , the medical director of the hospital ' s infectious_diseases unit would not confirm any specifics of Lakin ' s illness , or even that the hyperbaric_chamber was not utilized . &quot; If indeed it was not used in this case it must have been because there were circumstances why it could not be , &quot; said Dr. Mark Mazur . As an example , Mazur said patients with extremely low blood_pressure should not be placed into the pressurized chamber , but he would not say whether that was the case with Lakin , a vigorous man who jogged almost every morning and planned to run his 10th Los Angeles Marathon this spring . &quot; The reasons that people receive one treatment or another have to do with that individual particularly . The hyperbaric_chamber is felt often to be beneficial , but every case is different , &quot; Mazur said . &quot; From my knowledge , this individual had a very quick illness , &quot; he said . The staff at Los Robles has treated a total of six patients with necrotizing fasciitis this year , Wilmeth said . Five of them were given pure oxygen treatments in the hyperbaric_chamber to kill the bacteria and survived ; Lakin was the sixth . &quot; We don ' t get everything referred to us in this world , which is unfortunate , particularly if we think we could have helped somebody . All I can tell you is that in this case , we were not called , &quot; Wilmeth added . The Times reported Monday that Lakin ' s death was the first known fatality from &quot; flesh-eating bacteria &quot; in California , but state officials later estimated that between 14 and 42 deaths from the infection occur annually in California . They said they have no firm figures . Marilyn Billimek , a Ventura County public health nurse and epidemiologist , said that Lakin was the first known death in the county due_to this condition . There were four deaths in Los Angeles County during the first six months of 1994 , said Dr. Laurene Mascola , chief of Los Angeles County ' s Acute Communicable Disease Control Unit . Bob Howard , a spokesman for the Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta , said it is estimated that there are between 150 and 300 deaths annually from the &quot; flesh-eating bacteria &quot; in the United States . He said the numbers are not dramatic enough to show any unusual trends in any particular region of the country . Howard said there are an estimated 10 # 000 serious cases of Group_A streptococcus a year and of that about 2 # 000 manifest themselves as necrotizing fasciitis . Lakin ' s sudden_death left students and faculty shaken at the three community_college campuses around Ventura County . Flags were flown at half-staff Monday and administrators spent much of the day debating how to replace Lakin , a popular chancellor who many credit with leading the 28 # 000-student district from the brink of budgetary and organizational chaos . Lakin had complained of a severe sore_throat to colleagues Wednesday . Friends said he waited until Friday to go_to the Los Robles emergency_room . * Physician Mazur would not comment on what treatment Lakin received that day , but friends said he was treated for symptoms of strep_throat , then released . On Saturday , Lakin returned to the emergency_room , saying that he had a sharp pain in his leg and that the tenderness in his throat had not improved . He was then admitted to the hospital . Within hours , the disease &quot; spread like wildfire , &quot; his friends said . &quot; He was unconscious a great portion of the time , &quot; said one source close to the family . &quot; He went_in for exploratory surgery before the amputation of his leg and never regained consciousness. &quot; Again , Mazur declined to comment on specifics of Lakin ' s treatment , but did say that amputation is sometimes an option in dealing with the bacterial infection . Ventura County Coroner Ronald L . O ' Halloran said Monday that the hospital notified his office that Lakin died of necrotizing fasciitis . O ' Halloran , however , said he did not know if that would be the official cause of death stated on Lakin ' s death certificate . O ' Halloran said the coroner ' s office had no further involvement in the case . He said that state law only requires that the coroner investigate suspicious deaths , noting that Lakin had been under private medical_care for more_than 24 hours before his death . Doctors hastened to quell mounting fears from the public caused by news of the swift escalation of Lakin ' s infection . Staff at Los Robles has already been fielding frightened calls from people about &quot; flesh-eating bacteria. &quot; &quot; This is not a mystery , &quot; Mazur said at a news_conference Monday afternoon . &quot; This is a disease that has been described for many years . It may_not even be being seen in increased frequencies. &quot; And Howard pointed_out that the disease has been highly treatable by penicillin for more_than 100 years . &quot; We know what it is and we know how to treat it , &quot; he said . &quot; Penicillin is extremely effective against this disease . The key is to get_to a doctor as quickly as possible. &quot; Howard said the bacteria can enter the body through a break_in the skin , such_as a cut or burn . As the bacteria multiplies and attacks the skin and fatty_tissue , its toxins then enter the blood stream . He said the first warning signs might be an unusual redness , discoloration or some_other indicator that a wound is not healing properly . &quot; About everyone who dies from this disease dies because they did not seek treatment quickly enough , &quot; Howard said . &quot; The speed at which this disease moves is staggering . It can actually spread at a rate of one inch ( of flesh and tissue ) per hour . It is one of the few diseases in which you can actually see the spread of it. &quot; Staff writer Carlos Lozano and correspondents Jeff McDonald and Matt Mosk contributed to this story .</TEXT>
