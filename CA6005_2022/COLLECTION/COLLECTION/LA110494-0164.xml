   <HEADLINE> CROWD ASSAULTS ARAFAT AS HE TRIES TO PRAY FOR SLAIN ACTIVIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Islamic militants publicly humiliated Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday , physically assaulting him as he attempted to pray over the body of an activist assassinated Wednesday in a car bombing . According to eyewitnesses , thousands of enraged mourners at the Omari mosque in Gaza City jostled Arafat so roughly that they knocked his trademark black-and-white-checked kaffiyeh from his head , then pushed him out of the mosque into a rainstorm . &quot; Arafat is a collaborator , &quot; the protesters yelled at the man who for decades has been the symbol of Palestinian nationalism . &quot; Get_out of here , Arafat . Get_out ! You are not our leader ! We are the people , and we reject you ! &quot; they shouted as soon as the PLO leader entered the mosque . Arafat ' s bodyguards reportedly were unable to protect him from the crowd . His aides refused to comment on the incident , and the Voice of Palestine , the Palestinian Authority ' s radio_station , omitted it from news_reports Thursday night . Both officials of the Palestinian Authority and leaders of Islamic militant organizations in the Gaza Strip have publicly blamed Israel for the assassination of Hani Abed , 35 , a known member of the Islamic Jihad . Abed ' s car blew_up Wednesday in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis as he opened the trunk . Abed had been arrested many times , both by Israel and the Palestinians , in connection with attacks on Israeli soldiers in Gaza . &quot; This is not just a belief , this is the truth , &quot; said Freih abu Medeen , the Palestinian Authority ' s minister of justice , when asked_in a telephone_interview whether he believed Israel was responsible_for Abed ' s death . &quot; This is the first bullet in this dirty war the Israelis are beginning , &quot; Medeen said . He said a new cycle of violence between Israel and Islamic extremists is likely to begin as a result of Abed ' s assassination . Medeen cited a report two weeks ago in the_British newspaper the Observer saying that Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin had authorized an assassination campaign against leaders of the militant organization Hamas in the wake of Hamas ' bloody bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv . Hamas and Islamic Jihad are rival Islamic groups , but they share the goal of attacking Israeli targets and undermining the Israeli-PLO peace accord . &quot; This is the Israeli style . They have used it many times before , &quot; Medeen said . &quot; The Israelis waited only for President Clinton to leave , and for the regional economic conference in Casablanca ( Morocco ) to end. &quot; Clinton toured the region last week as Israel and Jordan signed a peace pact , and the first-ever regional business conference involving officials and business people from both Israel and the Arab states ended Tuesday in Casablanca . In Gaza on Thursday , both the PLO and Islamic organizations declared a general strike to protest the killing . Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaflets vowed to seek revenge for the assassination . Israeli officials did not deny the accusations . &quot; I am not saying that Israel did_it , &quot; said Uri Dromi , head of the government press office . &quot; But people such_as Mr. Abed should know that they cannot commit terrorist acts and expect to walk away from it. &quot; Privately , some officials said it does not hurt for Islamic militants to believe Israel was involved , whether it was or not . A series of attacks by Hamas on Israelis last month shook the nation and raised questions about the effectiveness of the security services . &quot; We shouldn ' t be surprised if the Israelis were involved , because this is a secret war , a war conducted in the shadows , and you must use special means to respond to terrorism , &quot; said Yonah Alexander , a specialist in international terrorism at Tel Aviv University . Alexander noted that Israel carried_out a campaign of assassinations in Europe in 1972 , after the PLO ' s Black September faction murdered 11 Israelis at the Olympics in Munich , Germany . Even liberal Parliament member Dedi Zucker , chairman of the Knesset ' s constitution , law and justice committee , said there are limited instances when a state may be justified in killing its opponents . &quot; The rule is that a state is not an agent of revenge , &quot; Zucker told Israel Radio on Thursday . But he added , &quot; I see the possibility , and again it must be very rare , that a democracy can deviate from its norms and then immediately return to them. &quot; But Palestinian sources said Thursday that some Islamic militants suspect that the Palestinian Authority may have been involved in Wednesday ' s assassination . There are several Islamic Jihad organizations in Gaza , not all_of which are allied_with the PLO . Abed belonged_to one that opposes the Palestinian Authority . The Islamic groups pose the most significant challenge to Arafat ' s authority in Gaza and in the West_Bank town of Jericho , and threaten to undermine negotiations with Israel to extend self-rule throughout the West_Bank . Arafat has tried unsuccessfully to incorporate Islamic militants into his government . Medeen said that he interrogated Abed in May , after Israel requested his arrest in connection with the drive-by_shooting that killed two Israeli soldiers in Gaza shortly after Israel handed day-to-day administration there over to the PLO . &quot; We held him for three weeks , but there was no evidence against him , &quot; Medeen said . &quot; But when we released him , I warned him that , where there was blood concerned , the Israelis show no mercy. &quot; Medeen dismissed the demands of the Islamic Jihad that the Palestinian Authority do more to protect its activists from Israeli attack . &quot; The Israelis have assassinated PLO leaders in Europe and in the Middle_East . They have kidnaped Lebanese clerics . This is their style . What can we do ? &quot; he said . Israeli officials continue to give contradictory signals on how they intend to deal with Hamas . Rabin has called_for international coordination to cut_off funding for Hamas , and continues to pressure Arafat to crack_down on Islamic militants in Gaza . But both Police Minister Moshe Shahal and Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin have recently spoken_of the possibility of opening a dialogue with what they termed &quot; moderate &quot; elements of Hamas . Beilin has said that Hamas could participate in Palestinian elections if there are members who are willing to jettison the destruction of Israel from their platform . Hours after the car_bomb killed Abed , Rabin spoke at a memorial service for Israeli soldiers . &quot; With one hand , we are shaking hands in peace with the Hashemite kingdom ( of Jordan ) , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; With the other hand , we are pulling on the trigger , in_order to hit the murderers from ( the Lebanese Islamic militant group ) Hezbollah , the terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. &quot;</TEXT>
