   <HEADLINE> PERES , ARAFAT HINT AT IMMINENT BREAKTHROUGH IN ISRAEL-PLO PACT ; MIDEAST : PROGRESS IS REPORTEDLY MADE IN OSLO . THE ISRAELI FOREIGN_MINISTER AND PLO CHIEF WILL MEET AGAIN SATURDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met here Saturday and held_out the prospect that an agreement on terms to implement their historic Mideast peace plan may be just a week away . Although they failed to meet rumored expectations of a breakthrough in Oslo , the two men announced that they will hold talks on the final obstacles next Saturday in Davos , Switzerland , during a meeting of the World Economic Forum , which they were both already scheduled to attend . &quot; Next week will be an important date to achieve what we are looking_for , &quot; Arafat said at a joint news_conference after the meeting . &quot; There are some small differences which we hope to overcome . If there is a will , there is a way , and we are sure we both have the will to go strongly , as we have from the beginning , to achieve real peace. &quot; Both sides refused to go_into specifics about what progress had been made in Oslo , but Peres later confirmed that he had brought new proposals on border agreements . &quot; May we ask your patience for another week ' s time , and then we shall give you the ( working ) paper , &quot; Peres said . &quot; None of us can say with safety that we shall reach a total agreement , but I can say we have the proper climate to do so. &quot; The talks followed more_than 24 hours of intensive behind-the-scenes mediation in Oslo , where secret diplomacy led to the initial declaration of principles for peace in September . Over the next week , Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organization delegates will continue negotiations in Oslo as well as at related talks in Washington and Taba , Egypt . The evening session , hosted by the Norwegian government , followed separate meetings that Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher held with Peres and Arafat on Saturday morning . The central figures in the Mideast drama were in Oslo for the funeral of Johan Jorgen Holst , the Norwegian foreign_minister whose initiative and perseverance led to the secret Palestinian-Israeli talks . Holst died Jan . 13 of a stroke at age 56 . Reflecting growing U.S. concern about the bogged-down Mideast peace process , Christopher warned both delegations about the dangers of further delays . &quot; The United States feels that they ought to move forward with implementation as fast as they possibly can , &quot; Christopher said at the outset of his talks with Arafat . The Clinton_Administration has been increasingly concerned about the escalating violence in Israel and the occupied territories , the growing influence of militant groups like the Islamic Resistance Movement , known as Hamas , and the impact the delays have_on providing international aid to Palestinians as a means of winning broader support for the Palestinian autonomy accord . A senior U.S. official traveling with Christopher emphasized the &quot; need to change life in the territories . The longer implementation is delayed , the greater the loss of hope. &quot; The negotiations have been bogged down by disputes over security arrangements at border crossings , the size and configuration of the Jericho district in the West_Bank and the security of Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas . Implementation had been_due to begin with an Israeli pullout Dec . 13 from the Gaza Strip and Jericho . The dangers were evident Saturday in reports that Israeli soldiers shot and wounded seven Palestinians in clashes in Hebron in the West_Bank . Troops reportedly opened_fire on young_men throwing stones and empty bottles , eyewitnesses told reporters . Despite the five-week delay in an agreement that would allow Israeli troops to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Jericho , Peres said that it is still possible to meet the April 13 deadline for the Palestinian areas to gain autonomy . Arafat ' s presence and his willingness to go_into details was also a factor_in the progress , according to U.S. officials . In his talks with Christopher , Arafat pulled_out maps and talked at length about specific problems and alternatives he or his representatives had been reluctant to deal with in the past . It was initially hoped that Arafat would remain in Oslo overnight to work_on a final agreement this weekend , but he left immediately after his meeting with Peres because of an unspecified commitment . &quot; We found both sides felt a need to come_to agreement as soon as possible , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said after Christopher ' s talks . &quot; There are clearly differences in the positions of the two sides . But both sides are focused_on bridging those differences. &quot; All sides had hoped for significant progress , in part to pay tribute to Holst . During his eulogy at the service , Christopher described Holst as &quot; at once imaginative and practical . He understood that change must come , not just through symbols but through pragmatic actions that would make a genuine difference in the day-to-day lives of the people. &quot; After the Israeli-PLO meeting , acting Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal announced the creation of an emergency fund to meet the &quot; urgent economic needs of the Palestinians and their institutions &quot; during the transition to autonomy . Both Arafat and Peres requested that the fund be named for Holst .</TEXT>
