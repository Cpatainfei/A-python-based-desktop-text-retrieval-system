   <TEXT> Got a minor ailment ? The best place for treatment in Europe could be Greece . Greece ? While the fact may be hard to believe , it ' s true -- officially listed in a recently published document that compares life in the European Union ' s 12 member states . There , in black_and_white , it shows that , at least in terms of quantity , Greece leads the way , with more doctors per capita than any of the richer northern countries . It also has the second-highest number of dentists in the Union , topped only by Denmark , and stands fifth in the number of pharmacists . But if things get serious , head north . Luxembourg , the_Netherlands and Germany have the highest number of hospital_beds per capita . On the verge of a nervous_breakdown ? Ireland offers more_than a tranquil setting . It has the most psychiatric beds per thousand inhabitants of any country in the Union . Above all , avoid Italy , which sits at or near the bottom in nearly every medical category listed . These and thousands of other facts are tucked into a small 28-page booklet , published by the EU ' s statistical office in Luxembourg , designed and distributed to give voters in recent European Parliament elections a chance to see where their own country stood_in comparison with neighboring nations . In fact , it has done much more . The book ' s simple design and broad distribution in all_the Union ' s nine official languages has given it an impact far beyond the normally dry fare dished_up by the statistical office , known as Eurostat . &quot; We ' ve gotten a lot of publicity , &quot; said John Wright , the office ' s press adviser . &quot; It has confirmed people ' s national prejudices , but there ' s also some surprises . Either way , the press loves to jump_on these kinds of comparisons. &quot; Among the surprises , beyond Greece ' s medical strength : * In Denmark , a nation noted for its progress toward sexual equality , women have a shorter life_expectancy than in any other member country . * The highest percentage of women in higher education is in Portugal -- 153 women for every 100 men . The lowest is in Germany -- 71 women for every 100 men . * Fertility and birthrates are currently running far higher in the northern countries , such_as Denmark , the_Netherlands and Luxembourg , than in the southern Roman_Catholic nations , such_as Spain , Italy and Portugal . In the not-so-surprising category , Britain has the wettest climate ; Spain and Greece have the driest . Belgium and Italy have the region ' s oldest populations , Ireland the youngest . The Dutch produce the most trash and the_Irish the most babies . The Eurostat survey , &quot; Facts Through Figures , &quot; also carries some interesting information for those just passing_through . If you ' re filling the gas_tank , for example , do_it either in Luxembourg ( $ 2.50 a gallon ) or Britain ( $ 2.80 ) , but avoid Italy ( $ 3.83 ) and the_Netherlands ( $ 3.74 ) . Taken collectively , the Eurostat figures sketch a region that is still divided by vastly different living standards and lifestyles , despite a gradual political and economic convergence over the past decade . The purchasing power of a Greek or Portuguese white-collar worker remains less than half that of their Dutch , German or British counterparts , their social benefits are far fewer , and their earnings are more likely to be eaten by inflation . Unemployment in Spain is also nearly 10 times that in Luxembourg and nearly quadruple Germany ' s rate . At the same time , the southern Mediterranean countries remain the principal guardians of traditional values , listing fewer divorces , larger families and fewer children born_out of wedlock . In Denmark , with its relaxed approach to family structure , just under half of all births ( 46.4 % ) in 1992 occurred out of wedlock . In Greece , the figure was closer to 1 in 50 . Still , la dolce vita remains firmly anchored in the south , where Eurostat discovered that the Greeks and Portuguese spend more_than twice as much of their disposable_income on food , drink and tobacco than do the more reserved Dutch , Germans and Belgians to the north . The intense interest in the recent survey has spurred Eurostat to present other issues in an easy-to-read form . &quot; We ' re working on one now that looks_at education in the Union , showing the number of people learning English in every country , &quot; Wright said . &quot; It ' s not going_to please the_French very much. &quot; Spotlighting the Differences Among the glimpses into life in Europe , provided in a new 28-page booklet published by the European Union : Belgium : % live_births outside marriage : 11.6 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 2.2 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 107 Women per 100 men in college : 93 * Denmark : % live_births outside marriage : 46.4 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 2.5 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 97 Women per 100 men in college : 111 * Germany : % live_births outside marriage : 15.4 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 1.7 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 91 Women per 100 men in college : 71 * Greece : % live_births outside marriage : 2.6 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 0.6 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 92 Women per 100 men in college : 103 * Spain : % live_births outside marriage : 10.0 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 0.6 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 103 Women per 100 men in college : 105 * France : % live_births outside marriage : 31.8 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 1.9 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 101 Women per 100 men in college : 114 * Ireland : % live_births outside marriage : 18.0 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : -- Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 99 Women per 100 men in college : 85 * Italy : % live_births outside marriage : 6.8 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 0.4 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 94 Women per 100 men in college : 100 * Luxembourg : % live_births outside marriage : 12.7 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 1.8 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 109 Women per 100 men in college : -- * Netherlands : % live_births outside marriage : 12.5 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 2.0 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 91 Women per 100 men in college : 84 * Portugal : % live_births outside marriage : 16.1 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 1.3 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 130 Women per 100 men in college : 153 * Britain : % live_births outside marriage : 30.8 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 3.0 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 108 Women per 100 men in college : 95 * AVERAGE : % live_births outside marriage : 19.5 Divorces per 1 # 000 inhabitants : 1.6 Girls per 100 boys at secondary_school : 99 Women per 100 men in college : 95 Health_Care Highs and Lows Doctors per thousand : Greece : 4.3 Italy : 1.1 Hospital_beds per thousand : Luxembourg : 12.6 Spain and Portugal : 4.4 Dentists per thousand : Denmark : 1.0 Portugal : 0.1 Source : Eurostat , the European Union statistical office</TEXT>
