   <HEADLINE> SPIELBERG ' S CREATIVITY MAY BE GETTING A NEW FOCUS ; ENTERTAINMENT : EXPANSION INTO HIGH-TECH VENTURES IS A POSSIBILITY . DEAL-MAKING COULD ECLIPSE FILMMAKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After creating dinosaurs real enough to scare up nearly $ 1 billion at the box_office with &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and a wrenchingly real-to-life vision of the Holocaust with &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; what ' s next for Steven Spielberg ? The answer could be &quot; Let ' s Make a Deal. &quot; The 46-year-old director / producer , who is expected to sweep tonight ' s Academy Awards for &quot; Schindler , &quot; has signaled that he may temporarily shift his attention from filmmaking to deal-making in the coming year as he takes a well-publicized directing sabbatical . Spielberg has always been ambivalent about the pure business side of the business -- even as he has amassed vast personal wealth from a string of hits stretching from &quot; Jaws &quot; to &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; But sources say he finally appears ready to take_advantage of opportunities to expand Amblin Entertainment , the company that has served as his base for more_than 10 years . Creative Artists Agency , the Hollywood talent firm that represents Spielberg , is in discussions with top technology companies over a number of business ventures that would move him swiftly onto the information superhighway . Sources say that Spielberg , who is personally close to CAA ' s deal-making chairman , Michael S . Ovitz , sees much of his future in interactive technology , computer_games and other forms of &quot; alternative &quot; entertainment . &quot; He ' s had discussions about all_of that , &quot; one associate said . &quot; But he ' s not thinking_about anything now except the Academy Awards , and he won ' t focus_on this for several months. &quot; New technology would be a natural progression for Spielberg , who has always operated_on the cutting edge of special_effects in movies and television , and who is technically proficient enough to play video_games over long-distance phone_lines with actor / comedian Robin Williams . The director , who is responsible_for four of the top 10 movies of all time , is mum on the question , though friends say he is intrigued by the idea of reinventing himself as a New Age entertainment / technology guru , after overseeing video_game spinoffs of his movies . At Amblin , which is housed in a Southwestern-style complex on the MCA / Universal Pictures lot , plans are under way to consolidate Amblin / Universal ' s London-based animation group , Amblimation , with the rest of Spielberg ' s Los Angeles operations as part of the restructuring . Yet the big question on many industry executives ' minds is whether Spielberg has the same will to direct a broad-based entertainment empire as movies . The prevailing view in Hollywood is that Amblin operates more as an outlet for Spielberg ' s personal creative impulses than a traditional business . That has served the company well in the film arena , where Spielberg lavishes most of his attention . But the company is considered an underachiever in other media . &quot; Steven tends to obsess over one project at a time , &quot; one associate said . &quot; that ' s a great quality in an artist , but not such a good quality if you ' re running a company. &quot; One example of that is feature animation , where Amblin was seen as a threat to Walt Disney Co. ' s hegemony in the 1980s , after producing &quot; An American Tail &quot; and &quot; The Land Before Time &quot; for Universal Pictures . Amblin was also behind &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit , &quot; which became a major hit for Disney . But lately it has had trouble duplicating that success . Amblin ' s most recent release was &quot; We ' re Back , &quot; a dinosaur tale that quickly became extinct despite its shared pedigree with &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; After being blasted by critics , it took_in only $ 9 million at the box_office last fall . The explanation from Hollywood insiders : Spielberg was too busy working_on &quot; Jurassic &quot; and &quot; Schindler ' s &quot; to supervise it . Amblin has had more success in TV animation , with &quot; Tiny Toons &quot; and &quot; Animaniacs &quot; on the Fox network . At Warner Bros. , which distributes both programs , President Terry Semel said those cartoons alone qualify Spielberg as a major animation force . &quot; He has two of the most successful animated shows on the air ever , two Emmy-award-winning and financially successful shows , &quot; Semel said . &quot; He helped create all these characters and is actively involved in every episode and all_the marketing and merchandising of the product that has come about. &quot; But even if Spielberg can lay claim to the hearts and minds of kiddie cartoon watchers everywhere , he is still searching for that same level of acceptance in prime_time . Amblin ' s latest launch , &quot; seaQuest DSV , &quot; ranked 78th in the most recent Nielsen ratings . In its Sunday time_slot , it is in fourth place behind CBS ' &quot; Murder , She Wrote , &quot; ABC ' s &quot; The Adventures of Lois and Clark , &quot; and Fox ' s &quot; Martin / Living Single &quot; combination . Some industry_analysts also see disturbing similarities to &quot; Amazing Stories , &quot; the ambitious but unsuccessful Amblin anthology series that ran_on NBC in the 1980s . In both instances , they say Spielberg may have miscalculated the tastes of the viewing audience . &quot; The incredible success he has had in features is unique and it hasn ' t happened in the TV world , at least as yet , probably because of cost considerations and in a sense , the audience is different than his core audience in the feature world , &quot; said Kenneth Ziffren , one of Hollywood ' s leading attorneys . &quot; His successful pictures are selling to the 12-to-24 or 12-to-34-year-olds and that ' s not the bulk of the core TV network audience today. &quot; Brandon Tartikoff , who headed entertainment at NBC when &quot; Amazing Stories &quot; aired , said he was awe-struck by Spielberg ' s story-crafting . But , like many people who have worked with Amblin , Tartikoff said the magic often disappeared when Spielberg delegated . &quot; This is a business where you ' ve got_to have not just great chiefs , but great Indians , &quot; Tartikoff said . Amblin ' s staff of 60 is unlike most others in Hollywood . From the start , Spielberg has surrounded himself almost entirely with creative people instead of business_executives . On the positive side , that has made Amblin more nimble than many competitors . Entertainment attorney Linda Lichter said : &quot; I think dealing with Amblin is much better than dealing with the studios because the chain of command is shorter . People obviously have to check with Steven on creative issues like hiring a director or writer , but Amblin likes to have its own creative controls and the studios don ' t look_to overrule them. &quot; The creative hothouse environment at Amblin has also spawned a lot of fresh talent , said David Kanter , a motion_picture agent at United Talent Agency . &quot; Steven has championed a number of young writers and directors , &quot; Kanter said . &quot; When he ' s in town and focused , he gets extremely involved . He ' s not an absentee producer . He develops personal_relationships with people he wants to work with . His seal_of_approval is extremely important in this town. &quot; Among the filmmakers Spielberg has helped launch are Robert Zemeckis of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; fame , director Chris Columbus of &quot; Home Alone , &quot; Kevin Reynolds , whose film &quot; Fandango &quot; was a first starring role for Kevin Costner , and director Phil Joanou . On the downside , critics say that Amblin ' s unconventional structure encourages cult-like devotion to Spielberg , rather than Hollywood ' s usual creative give_and_take . &quot; It ' s a very dysfunctional place emotionally because Steven is perceived as a deity , &quot; said one former employee who asked not to be identified , partly on grounds that all Amblin workers are required to sign lifelong confidentiality agreements . &quot; He ' s not really the head of a company , he ' s sort of god . He ' s protected at all turns from everything that will be unpleasant . The line you walk there is you never bring anything unpleasant to him . &quot; When I got there , someone said : ' Steven is the company , don ' t ever forget that , ' &quot; the former Amblin executive added . &quot; It ' s not like a regular working experience. &quot; Most people agree that former Amblin president Kathleen Kennedy was the only person who consistently stood_up to Spielberg . She and her husband , Frank Marshall , ran Amblin until last year , when they left to form a production company at Paramount Pictures . Neither returned repeated calls_for comment . In May , another husband-and-wife team will replace them . Writer-producer Walter Parkes has been hired as president of Amblin ' s movie division , and producer Laurie MacDonald will serve as executive_vice_president . But even in light of Amblin ' s likely forays_into the high-tech arena , Parkes and MacDonald said they are committed to keeping the company close to its roots . &quot; Amblin has been a filmmaker enterprise historically , that has been the key to its success , &quot; Parkes said . &quot; Steven and I have had no specific talks , but I get the impression he ' s looked_at certain ( high-tech ) companies . . . . The real challenge is going_to be to help focus_on the most essential thing -- the creative impulse that flows into these new business opportunities. &quot; Creativity versus commerce . That has always been the key issue in discussions over Spielberg ' s future , and there is no reason to believe that will change . Sources say he receives counsel from a close circle of associates that includes Ovitz , MCA President Sidney J . Sheinberg ; his manager , Gerald Breslauer , and his lawyer , Bruce Ramer . Ultimately , however , Spielberg tends to follow his own instincts . In the past that has meant maintaining the status_quo , despite countless opportunities to grow his business beyond its core base of movies , TV , video and merchandising . A few years ago , Spielberg and director Martin Scorsese considered launching a low-budget film company called Red Shoes . The idea , sources said , was to make independent , filmmaker-driven movies that might be too offbeat for the studios . Spielberg and Scorsese spoke_to various Japanese investors but were unsuccessful in raising money , supposedly because neither was willing to make a total commitment to be involved creatively with the projects . One source close to the talks said Spielberg -- who is accustomed to others financing his dreams -- balked at the idea of having to pay $ 200 # 000 to put_together a business plan for the company , which died after three months of discussions . On the financial side , Spielberg has declined offers to take Amblin public , even though Wall_Street sources said he could easily raise half a_billion dollars , based on his name alone . One reason is that Spielberg has access to more_than enough cash needed to finance his assorted projects . He has worked all_over Hollywood , but is closest to MCA / Universal and Warner Bros . Universal Pictures Chairman Tom Pollock said Spielberg has the clout to make whatever he wants , though Universal also brings certain projects to his attention . &quot; I think he ' s always had this thing about focusing_on the projects , not focusing_on the machine , &quot; one source said . &quot; He ' s used Universal and Warner to basically be his machine. &quot; Friends point to that as a prime example of Spielberg ' s business savvy , which is sometimes overlooked in stories focusing_on the goofy man-child image of the director . Spielberg has helped perpetuate that image by saying things like : &quot; I ' m not really interested in making money . that ' s always come as a result of success , but it ' s not been my goal. &quot; Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg is partnered with him in the restaurant DIVE ! , which they plan to take national after the first one opens in May in Century City . Asked about Spielberg ' s financial prowess , Katzenberg laughed and said : &quot; Give me a break , the guy ' s a killer . He ' s as smart as anyone , and he understands the business as well as anyone. &quot; That is borne_out in Hollywood deal meetings , where sources say Spielberg has the unsettling ability to segue from boyish yarn-spinner to flinty negotiator . Knowledgeable executives said he receives $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million against a small piece of initial gross receipts on his movies . Once a studio has recouped its production_costs and earned a low distribution fee , Spielberg ' s overall take of the net receipts is said to skyrocket to 50 % . One former negotiator said : &quot; I think he ' s a son-of-a-bitch business-wise . George Lucas is the same way . They have a huge amount of leverage , so they can make tough deals. &quot; Spielberg ' s tough negotiating stance and occasional brusqueness have created a certain level of hostility toward him within his industry . But Warner ' s Semel said he is worth the money . &quot; In general , it ' s fair to say , both as director and producer , his deal is commensurate with his success . He has a very good_deal . If you ' re up there as one of the best , as Steven is the best , he ' d be a fool not to be compensated as the very best. &quot; Although few people know his precise worth , it is believed to be in excess of $ 500 million . Friends are fond of pointing_out that Spielberg will continue to make more money than most Hollywood heavyweights , whether he expands his business or not . Yet keeping people guessing about his next moves has always been part of Spielberg ' s magic . For the near term at least , Amblin continues to churn_out highly commercial entertainment . &quot; The Flintstones , &quot; which is in post-production , is being touted as Universal ' s big summer movie . Still before the cameras are &quot; The Little Rascals &quot; and &quot; Casper. &quot; &quot; Little Giants &quot; starts next month . Another project , which bears the title , &quot; To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar , &quot; goes_into production in July . Amblin is also taking another swing at feature animation with &quot; Balto , &quot; the story of an Alaskan dog that saves lives . &quot; Tiny Toons , &quot; &quot; Animaniacs &quot; and &quot; seaQuest &quot; are cranking away . MCA ' s Sheinberg , who has served as a mentor to Spielberg for more_than a quarter of a century , said he expects the director to remain intimately involved_with Amblin , even during his sabbatical . He recalled driving onto the Universal lot just two days after the Jan . 17 earthquake , and finding Spielberg busily inspecting the damage to his sets and building . Sheinberg would not speculate on where Amblin goes from here , but said its future is secure . &quot; He can do whatever he wants with Amblin , &quot; Sheinberg said . &quot; The test should always be , does_it work for Steven ? &quot;</TEXT>
