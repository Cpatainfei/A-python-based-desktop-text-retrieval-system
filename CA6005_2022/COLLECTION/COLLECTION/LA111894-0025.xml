   <HEADLINE> DON SCHANCHE ; TIMES FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Don Schanche , a retired Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent who was one of the most widely traveled and highly regarded journalists of his time , died Thursday of cancer at his home_in Key Biscayne , Fla . He was 68 . Schanche came_to The Times in 1976 from a distinguished career as a magazine editor and writer . As a reporter for Life magazine and later as an editor and writer for the Saturday Evening Post and Holiday , and as a free-lance writer , Schanche crisscrossed the globe , diving for treasure in Bermuda , trekking with Laotian hill tribesmen , sailing on the first underwater crossing of the Atlantic aboard the U.S. nuclear submarine Skate . While at Life , Schanche was ghost writer for the Mercury astronauts who charted America ' s path into space . As a free-lance writer , he was Saul Kapel MD , author of a syndicated newspaper_column on child_psychology . In the last 15 years of his professional_life , Schanche served as Times bureau chief in Cairo , Rome and Miami , from which he covered , respectively , the Middle_East , the Mediterranean and the Caribbean . Schanche chronicled turmoil in Iran -- the fall of the Shah and the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini -- the civil_war in Lebanon , war between factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat . Schanche , whose first foreign post was as a 25-year-old Korean_War correspondent for the International News Service , was an inveterate -- and irreverent -- student of human nature : &quot; I never met a truly evil man who was not also a charming son_of_a_bitch , &quot; he observed recently . From Rome , he covered the attempted 1981 assassination of Pope John Paul II , and reported from 66 countries on 29 trips with the Pope across 250 # 000 miles . To colleagues , Schanche ' s insouciance -- he was unflappable in the face of destruction , death and deadline -- was one of his most remarkable traits . He was legendary for his aplomb under_fire . Breakfasting by the pool at Beirut ' s Hotel Commodore after a mortar attack one morning , Schanche politely complained to the waiter that there was shrapnel in his eggs . In 1991 , Schanche , who had been an inveterate smoker , was diagnosed with lung_cancer . In November , 1993 , he was found to have inoperable pancreatic_cancer , a terminal illness he endured with grace . One recent day in Miami , while a particularly colorless specialist earnestly poked him , Schanche asked , &quot; Tell me , doctor , will I keep my sense_of_humor until the end ? &quot; He did . Donald Arthur Schanche was born in New Brunswick , N.J. , of Norwegian stock on May 26 , 1926 . He grew_up outside Atlanta where , as a seventh-grader , he met Marybelle Waddington . They were married on Jan . 7 , 1952 , in Tokyo . Schanche attended Georgia Tech and the University of Miami , and graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in journalism in 1950 . During World_War_II he served in the U.S. Navy as radioman with a P.T. boat squadron in the Philippines . His six books include &quot; Mister Pop : The Adventures of a Peaceful Man in a Small War , &quot; about an Indiana farmer who went_to Laos as an agricultural adviser and found himself drawn into conflict , and &quot; The Panther Paradox : A Liberal ' s Dilemma , &quot; about Eldridge Cleaver and the Black Panthers . Schanche is survived by his wife ; a son , Donald A . Jr. , city_editor of the Union-Recorder in Milledgeville , Ga ; two daughters , Didrikke ( Didi ) Schanche-Shields , an Associated Press correspondent in Nicosia , Cyprus , and Anne Schanche Ferro , an associate administrator of the Motor_Vehicle Administration of Maryland ; a brother , Norman Dean Schanche , a retired Army colonel , of Severna Park , Md. , and six grandchildren .</TEXT>
