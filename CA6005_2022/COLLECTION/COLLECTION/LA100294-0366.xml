   <HEADLINE> SOME RIDERS SAY FARE HIKE IS ANYTHING BUT FAIR ; TRANSPORTATION : THE PLANNED INCREASE COULD HINDER THE ESTIMATED 475 # 000 PEOPLE WHO RIDE THE BUS DAILY IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By 5:45 a.m. , Pearl Daniels is waiting for bus No . 206 at Normandie Avenue and 6th Street so she can head to work in West Hollywood . For Daniels , 60 , the daily routine includes a transfer to another bus at Normandie Avenue and Sunset Boulevard so that she can get_to her job as a telephone_operator at the Hyatt Hotel on Sunset by 7 a.m. When she gets_off work_at 3 p.m. , Daniels hustles across the boulevard to catch the No . 3 bus and begin her hourlong ride back home . For years , buses have meant as much to Daniels as do cars to the throngs of solo motorists who clog the Southern California freeways each rush_hour . But these days her reliance on public_transit has Daniels so fearful of a proposed 25-cent bus_fare hike and the possible elimination of monthly bus passes that she rarely spends money riding a bus for anything other_than work . &quot; If I can help it , I don ' t go_out , &quot; said Daniels , who lives_on Ardmore Avenue in Koreatown . &quot; I don ' t hop_on the bus like I used to . &quot; Throughout Los Angeles , remarks from people whose livelihoods depend almost entirely on buses show that Daniels is far from alone . Several riders , of whom transit officials say there are an estimated 475 # 000 daily in the metropolitan area , said they are_on edge because their lives would become significantly more difficult under the proposed hike by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which calls_for one-way fares to increase from $ 1.10 to $ 1.35. While the fare hike issue is still in legal limbo , it has raised fears that the higher fares may cause some poor residents to miss medical appointments , cut_back on grocery shopping , jeopardize job opportunities or become reclusive . The fears already have manifested themselves in cries of protest at MTA meetings from advocates for the poor and even resulted in a hunger_strike that left two men seriously ill during the summer before it was called_off . Advocates for riders emphasize that about six in 10 regular riders have household incomes of less than $ 15 # 000 a year , and therefore any increase would prove a financial burden on the majority of riders . Most riders board buses more_than once each day , resulting in a total of nearly 1.2 million boardings daily . MTA officials , meanwhile , are trying to convince anyone who will listen that the authority ' s first bus_fare hike in six years is essential to combat a $ 126-million operating deficit that if left unaddressed is bound to result in_service problems down the road . Besides , they say , tokens would remain available to bus riders at 90 cents each . All sides are anxiously awaiting a decision by U.S. District Judge Terry J . Hatter Jr . on whether the fare hike would unfairly burden poor and minority residents , who make_up the vast majority of bus riders . A hearing is scheduled Oct . 17 on whether a trial should be held_on a lawsuit accusing the MTA of discrimination in pushing for the fare hike . Undoubtedly , many poor and minority residents in Los Angeles already are convinced they are being taken_advantage of regardless of Hatter ' s ruling . Lawsuits and spreadsheets aside , many riders believe they will bear the brunt of whatever decision is made . Daniels , waiting for a bus home from work near social hot spots such_as The Comedy Store and House of Blues , said she thought the impact of the bus_fare issue would be_better understood if officials paid_attention to the problems riders face each day . Indeed , the faces of those who depend_on public transportation can be forgettable for those who zip past bus_stops in cars . One moment , you see people waiting , then the stoplight changes from red to green and you are gone . It is easy to forget the tired elderly woman who sits on a bench in South-Central surrounded by plastic shopping_bags , one or two of them serving as pillows for the young boy with her . There is no way to know without asking that the young mother who is waiting for a bus with her infant is trying to get_to a baby-sitter and then to her job as a seamstress Downtown . The serious , middle-aged man standing in the shade is heading for a medical appointment . And once on a bus , riders can lose virtually all individuality . For many , it is the vehicle that people normally focus_on from outside , not the riders . Several bus riders attributed what they say is second-class treatment of riders to the notion that individual car ownership is an ingrained part of the Los Angeles culture . In other words , there must be something wrong with you if you do not own your own car and must ride a bus . Right now , Daniels said , there are probably many riders who feel worried or trapped and are saving every quarter for their most important rides . &quot; that ' s the way I feel . You can ' t get_out when you want to , &quot; Daniels said . &quot; They isolated me a lot already. &quot; Daniels , who decried the filth of some buses and the criminal activity that sometimes occurs on buses , said nonetheless that she normally feels comfortable riding them . But lately , stops at the market for milk , shopping trips , weekend rides to the park and visits to friends or family have been scaled back drastically , she said . &quot; The upkeep of a car is too expensive , &quot; said Daniels , who makes about $ 17 # 000 a year at the Hyatt . &quot; The bus is the only way I can go because the old car I had was always going_down and I was_on the bus anyway. &quot; To some bus riders the issue has become needlessly complicated by the excessive involvement of lawyers , a judge , transit officials and even some community activists . Several riders said the fare hike proposal exists simply because many decision_makers are out of touch with the struggles of the poor and are unwilling to seek other measures for raising funds . Ameer Rashid , who was waiting for a bus recently on Jefferson Boulevard off Crenshaw Boulevard , said he does not own a car and that those seeking a fare hike should be more concerned with improving mass transit services . &quot; I think people who ride the bus think it ' s high enough already , &quot; said Rashid , 56 , who relies_on buses about three times a week to get_to medical appointments or to do research for a local developer . &quot; The fare would be OK if the buses ran more often . Right now they don ' t run that frequent in this neighborhood . To talk_about a fare hike is ridiculous . They ain ' t had better service in six years . You ' ve got_to get what you pay for. &quot; That sentiment was echoed by Kim Hyun Kyung , 18 , who was among about a dozen people waiting for a bus at Western Avenue off Olympic Boulevard one day last week . &quot; It ' s too hard for the citizens , &quot; she said , referring to higher fares . The reliance many residents have_on the system is most obvious at bus_stops like the one at Spring and Temple streets by City_Hall . One afternoon , as buses came and went , the number of people waiting for their rides never seemed to get below a dozen or so . The flow was steady as buses headed for different parts of the county pulled_up , loaded passengers , and pulled_away every few minutes . Janet Gonzalez , 22 , stood holding her 3-month-old daughter , Stephanie . Gonzalez said the proposed fare hike is frightening to her and her husband because they are struggling to make ends meet . Both earn low wages mending clothes , and their daughter requires a baby-sitter , she said . &quot; It worries me a lot , &quot; Gonzalez said in Spanish . &quot; It is a big problem because salaries are low , especially for us Latinos. &quot; Andrea Greene , a spokeswoman for the MTA , said officials sympathize_with residents who may face hardship if the fare hike goes_through , but options such_as buying 90-cent tokens in packets of 10 are designed to ease the impact on the poor . A balanced MTA budget is mandatory by law , and although the proposed fare hike has drawn the most public attention , plans involve other cost-cutting measures such_as reducing services on lines carrying few passengers and cutting administrative positions within the agency , she said . &quot; I think a lot of people are afraid of the unknown , &quot; Greene said . &quot; Our passengers would be saving money by buying tokens . All we can do is keep_on talking to community groups and spreading the word at schools and at public meetings. &quot; Some riders , however , fear that using tokens would become too expensive if frequent stops and transfers are necessary -- a common occurrence for the thousands of riders who make one or more connections to get_across the city . Bus riders who make frequent transfers tend to rely_on the $ 42 monthly pass , which allows_for an unlimited number of rides and transfers . Besides the basic fare increase , the MTA proposal includes the elimination of regular monthly passes and increasing the fares on special monthly passes -- from $ 10 to $ 12 for monthly passes for senior_citizens and the disabled , including blind passengers who formerly traveled at no charge ; from $ 25 to $ 30 for college and vocational_school students , and from $ 18 to $ 20 for schoolchildren . Zone charges of 50 cents would apply on express_bus lines and the Blue Line trolley . Transfers would remain at 25 cents each . &quot; I can certainly understand . Just the sound of a fare raise is scary to people , &quot; Greene said . &quot; But we are in_line with what is happening across the country . What else can you buy now at 1988 prices ? &quot; Still , selling the plan to those who sit waiting for buses when they are dead tired , sick , late for a job interview or just eager to visit a friend is tough . It is not as though all riders want the same thing . For example , some vehemently oppose the higher fares while others are more interested in making_sure the regular $ 42 monthly passes are not lost . &quot; I don ' t begrudge them an increase , but keep the passes , &quot; said Michael Pell , 44 , a senior clerk typist for the Los Angeles Police_Department who rides buses regularly from Melrose and La Brea avenues to Downtown and back . &quot; It ' s good for the rider and it ' s good for the system . It ' s good for keeping buses on time. &quot; After a Sept . 12 hearing on the case in U.S. District Court , about 30 people gathered outside to oppose the fair hike and criticize authorities for their financial_support of a new , expensive regional rail system . Many bus riders and community activists are convinced that racial bias is a key factor influencing the call_for higher fares . Various activists and riders insist the transportation authority has funded rail projects that largely benefit affluent white commuters , rather than poor or minority riders . MTA officials dispute that accusation and now it appears that the discrimination will be decided in federal_court . In the meantime , MTA figures show that nearly 47 % of all bus riders are Latino , about 23 % are black , about 19 % are white , close to 9 % are Asian and the remainder are of other ethnic backgrounds . In addition , more_than 61 % of all riders have household incomes under $ 15 # 000 a year ; about 23 % earn between $ 15 # 000 and $ 30 # 000 , and a little more_than 10 % have household incomes between $ 31 # 000 and $ 50 # 000 . Less than 5 % bring_home more_than $ 50 # 000 , the figures show . Miguel Llorente , who earns a total of about $ 9 # 000 a year and shares an apartment in Hollywood with his brother , travels from bus to bus in_order to work two jobs and remain an active community volunteer . Llorente , 22 , works helping develop housing , business and youth services , and each day travels first to one local organization in Inglewood for a_few hours and then to another local group in South-Central . Easygoing and quick with a smile , Llorente said any increase in bus_fares could jeopardize one of his part-time jobs and would undoubtedly reduce the amount of volunteer work he could do to help youths in troubled neighborhoods . Tokens may be an option , he said , if the MTA comes_through with its plan to create more purchase sites . Llorente said he believes he could land higher-paying work , but for now is willing to sacrifice better wages for the satisfaction of working_at improving urban conditions at the grass-roots level . &quot; I have to struggle a lot but I ' m working for the community right now , &quot; he said . &quot; My thoughts are that the people of the MTA should understand that there are a lot of people like me who cannot travel at these higher prices .</TEXT>
