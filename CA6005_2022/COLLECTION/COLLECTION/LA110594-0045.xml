   <HEADLINE> TAJIKS MOVE GRUDGINGLY TOWARD RECONCILIATION ; EUROPE : HALF A_MILLION PEOPLE WHO FLED A DEADLY WAR HAVE COME HOME ; A TRUCE HOLDS . BUT TENSIONS SHROUD SUNDAY ' S ELECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two years after she was widowed and uprooted by war , Saipocho Kholikova returned here from a refugee camp and stood_in the vine-covered portico of her home . Backed by escorts from the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , she confronted a warrior of the victorious Kulyabi clan who had moved_into the four-room house . &quot; They opened the gate and told him I am back and I would live here , &quot; Kholikova recalled , sitting cross-legged on the matted floor of her vacant living_room . &quot; They said they would come_back and check on me. &quot; The intruder didn ' t leave right away . Three of his relatives came_around and -- in front of her two small children -- beat the frail , 45-year-old villager unconscious in her garden . They broke her windows . Confined in silence to one room , she shared the house with the man and his family for 10 weeks before they departed with her furniture , refrigerator , television_set and carpets . In this most devastating but esoteric of blood_feuds on former Soviet territory , Kholikova ' s ordeal passes for progress toward peace . The harassment has stopped , she wrote recently to her four grown children in Afghanistan : &quot; Come back , please . All is well. &quot; Deep in Central Asia , Tajikistan is moving haltingly , grudgingly toward reconciliation . Half a_million people who fled the war , including three-fourths of the 60 # 000 who camped in Afghanistan , have come_home to partly destroyed towns and farm villages . A temporary cease-fire has been in_force since Oct . 20 . A land of poets with little tradition of war or exile , the place might well be Nowhere-istan . In a conflict overshadowed by that in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in some ways harder to fathom , Tajikistan ' s snow-capped peaks and cotton-growing valleys erupted with gunfire among ideological enemies and regional clans after the Soviet_Union collapsed in 1991 . In late 1992 , Communist warriors of the Kulyabi clan , with tank support from the Russian army , drove an alliance of Islamists and democrats , along with their fighters of the Garmi and Pamiri clans , out of power and into Afghanistan . From there , they began low-intensity guerrilla raids . The war at its peak turned a 10th of the population into refugees . It has killed 20 # 000 people and caused $ 7 billion in damage to what was already the poorest Soviet spinoff state . The regime of Emamali S . Rakhmonov , a Kulyabi who once ran a collective cotton farm , has failed to consolidate its victory , the nation or any semblance of an economy , even with 25 # 000 Russian-led border troops and billions of Russian rubles . Now , the southern Kulyabis have fallen_out with their wartime allies , the northern Khodzhent clan , which ran the republic in Soviet days . Alarmed that the lingering insurgency could spread guns and drugs its way , Russia has coupled the military buildup in its neediest client state with pressure on Rakhmonov to make_peace . A growing cast of outsiders has reinforced this shift in Moscow ' s policy and broken Tajikistan ' s isolation . Jeeps emblazoned with the Red_Cross and blue U.N. logos fan_out on daily humanitarian and observer missions . Human_Rights Watch / Helsinki monitors the regime ' s police methods . Diplomats from the United States , United Nations and Iran keep contact with warring factions . The government last spring opened peace talks with the guerrilla-backed opposition . A U.N. observer mission has arrived to oversee the cease-fire and a promised exchange of 27 prisoners from each side . But the whole process is fragile . In September , the government executed one condemned Islamic mullah on the opposition ' s original prisoner list and admitted the unexplained death of another . It has refused to legalize four exiled parties or drop treason charges against their leaders , who in turn refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Sunday ' s presidential election . A deputy prime_minister died in a mine explosion the first day of the cease-fire . Refugees have benefited most from the foreign scrutiny , which has obliged Kulyabi warlords to disband their most brutal gangs . Paramilitary thugs have been quietly sent to Russia for training in the army , making_it safer for Garmis and Pamiris to come_home . &quot; The government has become more or less civilized , &quot; said Oinikhol Bobonazarova , a leader of the opposition Democratic Party in Dushanbe , the Tajik capital . Violence that killed 15 returning refugees last year abated after the two most powerful Kulyabi warlords , Sangak Safarov and Faizulli Saidov , shot each other dead . Saidov , so fearsome that southerners still fall silent at the mention of his name , bitterly opposed repatriation . And the harassment died_down further after Pierre-Francois Pirlot , a Frenchman who heads the U.N. refugee mission in Dushanbe , gave a scolding lecture on Tajik television last fall . He visited the camps to coax reluctant refugees to return , hooking them up by field radio to reassuring relatives back home . Tajik officials at all levels now endorse repatriation as smart counterinsurgency . &quot; We won ' t have quiet lives here as long as one of them is across the river in Afghanistan , &quot; said Safar Khalimov , a former warlord who is deputy mayor of this southern farming region and helps returnees get land and jobs . But in nearby villages populated by Garmis , young_men are scarce . Garmis and Kulyabis live too close for comfort , and many Kulyabis are still armed , so the Garmis who fought them -- or might be suspected of having done so -- stay away . Still , their mothers and young siblings are coming_back . On a collective_farm called Communism , Garmi war_widow Guljon Bukhoriyeva had just returned to her mud-brick home . The roof was gone , along with her four cows , but squash grew in the garden . Two years after leaving , she put a borrowed roof over one of her three rooms and moved_in . As she greeted visitors , her three young children pushed dry weeds into a mud-oven fire . Kulyabi neighbors have welcomed her back , she said , but her three grown children are staying &quot; in another part of Tajikistan. &quot; &quot; It is a true success story , &quot; Pirlot said of the repatriation . &quot; But my fear is , ' Is it going_to last ? ' The effort we ' ve made to rebuild things would n ' t stand a chance if the hard-liners decided to go at it again. &quot; That could happen as long as the welcome_mat does not extend_to opposition leaders , who speak_for 5 # 000 guerrillas . In the peace talks , the government insists on having the election Sunday without them ; the opposition wants a council of neutral statesmen , appointed by both sides , to rule for two years , disarm everyone , then hold elections . Guerrillas have stepped_up attacks in recent months , assassinating a deputy defense minister and seizing or killing 53 government soldiers in a single raid . &quot; These elections will not help the cause of peace , &quot; exiled Tajik poet-politician Davlat Khudonazarov told a recent U.S. congressional hearing . &quot; They will be held_in an environment where tens of thousands of people are running_around with guns in their hands. &quot; Citing the exclusion of opposition parties , the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe has rejected the government ' s invitation to monitor the election . But American and Russian diplomats support it , and at least some of them pin hope on Rakhmonov ' s only rival , his former prime_minister , Abdulmalik A . Abdulajanov . A wealthy businessman of the Khodzhent clan , he is viewed_as more conciliatory . Abdulajanov , 45 , accuses Rakhmonov of adopting &quot; a totalitarian mentality , &quot; preparing ballot fraud and spreading the threat of armed resistance if the ruling clan is voted_out . In fact , Rakhmonov , 42 , is appealing_to the hostile and the conciliatory instincts at play . At a recent campaign rally , a local military commander got_up and declared that &quot; this is my country and I ' ll never give it away to the opposition. &quot; But when Rakhmonov spoke , he pondered aloud why so many Tajiks had killed each other . &quot; We are still brothers , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
