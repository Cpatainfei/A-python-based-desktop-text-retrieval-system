   <HEADLINE> SURFING WALK OF FAME CATCHES A WAVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wave riding enthusiasts dedicated a Surfing Walk of Fame on Saturday to pay homage to the sport ' s pioneers , competitors and culture . &quot; I take great pride in being able to say I ' m the best surfer in the United States Congress , &quot; Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) , an avid surfer , told about 100 people gathered under sunny skies for the ceremony . &quot; Of course , some people do point_out that I ' m the only surfer in the U.S. Congress , &quot; said Rohrabacher , who surfs here frequently and has set_up his reelection campaign office in the back of a surf shop . With surf music by the Chantays blaring from speakers , the crowd gathered at Jack ' s Surfboards at Main_Street and Pacific Coast Highway to dedicate the walk , even though the first inductions will not be held until August . Sidewalk plaques will feature the image of a surfer and honorees ' names . Winners will be selected in four categories : surf pioneers , surf champions , surf culture and local heroes . Selected by sport representatives , the first inductions will be announced during the U.S. Open of Surfing . The late Hawaiian surfing pioneer , Duke Kahanamoku , also will be honored . &quot; There is no doubt that this is ' Surf City USA ' and Surf City worldwide , &quot; Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson said . A mix of professional and amateur surfers and residents were_on hand , including former world champion Peter Townend , who helped organize the walk of fame . &quot; Too often , people who have contributed to any sport are completely forgotten , &quot; Townend said . Several surfers , straddling their boards , bobbed amid the swells off Huntington Pier and looked seaward in search of the next big wave . &quot; I used to surf but I don ' t much anymore , &quot; said Chris Byrne , a 26-year resident of Huntington Beach , who attended with his wife , Debbie . &quot; Surfing is so_much a part of Huntington Beach we wanted to check this out. &quot;</TEXT>
