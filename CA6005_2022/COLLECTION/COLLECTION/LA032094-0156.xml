   <TEXT> I am a senior_citizen who traveled alone to visit my mother ' s birthplace in Lithuania . My railway pass was purchased in the United States and it was mentioned that no visa was required to pass_through the countries on my itinerary . When I boarded the train in Warsaw , the boarding sign read &quot; Warsaw to Vilnius &quot; only and did not name any intermediate stops . They neglected to inform me that the train would be going_through Grodno , Russia ( now Belarus ) , thereby requiring a visa . I was ordered off the train at 2 a.m. on a freezing morning to be interrogated at length regarding the reasons for my trip . After providing my identification and adequate explanations , I was allowed to continue on . On my return trip , I took a taxi for 120 miles from Vilnius to Grodno and again I was subjected_to the same ordeal . After approval , I was escorted to a Russian train bound directly for Warsaw . Both times I was treated well . AL ADELMAN Los Angeles Editor ' s note : Visas are required when traveling_to Lithuania , Russia and Belarus , according to Trans-World Visa Service of San Francisco . A spokeswoman said travelers may also need visas if they are simply passing_through . The Times lists visa requirements for travel in Africa on L3 . Other countries will be covered in coming weeks .</TEXT>
