   <HEADLINE> VIVA LOST EGYPT ; O.C. ARCHEOLOGY BUFFS GO ON EXPEDITION TO THE LUXOR IN LAS VEGAS ( YES , VEGAS ) TO VIEW THE RESORT ' S OVER-THE-TOP TAKE_ON AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He has stood before the Great Pyramid at Giza , excavated at Mendes in the northern Nile Delta , studied the tomb of Ramses II in Thebes , and led an ongoing expedition to the Precinct of the Goddess Mut at Karnak . On this spring morning , however , Egyptologist Richard A . Fazzini is gazing at Luxor -- the new Luxor , the one with a 30-story pyramid of bronzed glass towering over a gaudy golden sphinx that emits laser_beams from its eyes , the one with amusement park-style thrill rides that star an archeologist who utters New Age platitudes and has &quot; 3-D psychic visions &quot; during solar_eclipses . All of which begs a question : Just what is Fazzini doing here ? Well , for starters , he ' s looking slightly bemused . &quot; No matter how hard we try , &quot; he says with a shrug , &quot; the public sometimes gets a different idea of archeology than archeologists have. &quot; Fazzini was in Las Vegas at the invitation of the Orange County society of the Archaeological Institute of America , which organized a field trip to the resort . Society president and founder Norma Kershaw admits that some members of the group figured she had to be joking when she first proposed the excursion , but they signed_up anyway . The trip was a sellout . While bringing archeology buffs to Luxor would seem , on the surface , to make about as much sense as sending a paleontology convention to those roadside dinosaurs near Palm Springs , the archeology buffs were more_than willing to put_up with the faux-Egyptian touches in return for a little gambling and a show or two . The goal , Kershaw said , was &quot; to have an educational weekend while having a good time &quot; -- a_couple_of nights on the Strip , coupled with a morning lecture ( the trip also helped raise money for the group ' s educational efforts in county elementary_schools ) . Fazzini ' s talk was_on the history of Egyptomania , the fascination with all things Egyptian that started with the Romans and finds its ultimate expression in the newly opened Luxor . In addition to his excavations , Fazzini heads the Brooklyn Museum ' s Egyptian , classical and ancient Middle Eastern department , helping to oversee one of the world ' s finest collections of Egyptian antiquities . In his lecture at Luxor , he expressed dry amusement at the resort ' s over-the-top blend of carefully reconstructed authenticity and out-and-out fantasy . &quot; It is very hard for people not to associate Egypt with mystery , &quot; he told his audience of about 50 , crowded into a tiny , unfinished meeting room at the gigantic resort . &quot; It ' s almost silly to walk_around a casino and say , ' Is this accurate ? ' &quot; Later , when asked if it bothered him that the hotel perpetuates exotic visions of Egyptian civilization , Fazzini shook his head and said he takes it in the spirit of fun in which it is intended . &quot; If this place had a sign out front that said , ' If you take our Nile cruise , you ' ll never have any need to go_to Egypt or visit a museum , ' then I ' d have a problem. &quot; Kershaw , a retired archeologist who excavated at Cyprus and other sites around the Mediterranean , was likewise in a tolerant mood . &quot; I know it ' s all done tongue-in-cheek , so it doesn ' t bother me , &quot; she said . &quot; In a sense , it delights me , because it will stimulate people ' s interest in the real ancient Egypt. &quot; Luxor opened in October , a $ 375-million &quot; entertainment megastore &quot; with 2 # 526 hotel_rooms honeycombed along its inward-slanting walls . Contained within the towering central atrium are a 100 # 000-square-foot casino , seven themed restaurants , and an indoor canal carrying guests on a &quot; Nile cruise. &quot; Historical consultants were called_in to help guide the creation of indoor sculptures and wall murals , giving the resort a veneer of authenticity . There ' s also a painstaking detailed recreation tomb of King Tutankhamun ' s tomb , as it was found by Howard Carter and Lord Carnavon in 1922 . All the much-hyped attention to historical detail , however , exists alongside another vision of ancient Egypt that ' s pure fantasy . The three-part thrill ride puts high-tech film effects at the service of a story line that ' s a virtual grab bag of exotic myths about Egypt , some old ( ancient connections to Atlantis ) and some new ( flying machines discovered in a pyramid beneath , um , Las Vegas ) . Other fanciful touches in the resort include a pair of talking animated camels in the casino and an elaborate stage show , &quot; Winds of the Gods , &quot; about a Pharaoh whose resting place is disturbed by thieves . The show has a very un-Egyptian chariot_race as its climax . Luxor is part of a trend toward family entertainment in Las Vegas , the gaming mecca that in recent years has had to face competition from a steady growth of gambling in other parts of the country . It sits next door to Excalibur , with its fantasy castle motif , while farther along the Strip are such recent additions as the MGM Grand , with its &quot; Wizard of Oz &quot; theme , and the dueling pirates of Treasure Island . As Fazzini pointed_out , Luxor is not the first Las Vegas landmark to &quot; use the ancient world as a sort of adult theme park &quot; : the enduring Caesars Palace looked_to ancient Rome when it opened in 1966 . The real-life Luxor is an Egyptian market_town that has grown_up around the southern half of the ruins of the ancient city of Thebes . Architecturally , the Las Vegas Luxor is modeled loosely on the Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx at Giza . Luxor , said Fazzini , is the latest in a long line of &quot; Egyptianizing &quot; buildings , his term for structures inspired by the monuments of ancient Egypt . In fact , he said , the new resort is probably &quot; the most thoroughly Egyptianizing building in the United States. &quot; * The first to experience an Egyptian craze were the Romans , who conquered Egypt in 30 BC . European interest in ancient Egypt was revived during the Renaissance , but it was a somewhat skewed vision , according to Fazzini , filtered through Roman interpretations . Europe got a truer picture of Egypt in the 18th Century , as an increasing number of travelers ventured there and returned with accounts of the pyramids . Egyptomania blossomed with the Napoleonic expeditions of 1798 to 1801 , in which the ruler took an army of scholars along on a military_campaign that ultimately proved disastrous to his reign . Meanwhile , in North_America , a new nation had been created by the Founding Fathers with mystical visions of old Egypt , fed by their ties to Freemasonry . The evidence is right there on the back of the dollar_bill -- the Great Seal , with its steep-sided pyramid topped by an all-seeing eye . In many ways , ancient Egypt has come_to be a &quot; vector for symbols , &quot; representing mystery , wisdom , lost knowledge and immortality , Fazzini said . Architectural reminders of an American fascination with Egypt are legion . The use of Egyptian-style obelisks for memorial markers , a practice transplanted from Europe , was first seen in Baltimore in 1792 and culminated in the Washington Memorial , dedicated in 1885 . Fazzini showed slides of a vast array of Egyptian-influence buildings in the United States : museums , libraries , insurance offices , Masonic halls , even prisons . In a nod to ancient funerary practices , Egyptian touches were common in cemeteries through the 1920s , from gateways to memorial markers . One odd little marble marker from the 19th Century grouped_a Nativity scene with a dog-sized sphinx looking lovingly at the baby Jesus ; Fazzini described it as &quot; Jesus , Mary and Joseph and their pet sphinx. &quot; * In the mid-19th Century , architect Franklin Webster Smith proposed an elaborate new capital complex borrowing architectural_styles from across the world and earned some serious consideration from Congress . The design included a vast Egyptian hall and a model of the Great Pyramid and Great Sphinx on the Potomac . &quot; Does_it remind you of any building you ' re sitting in now ? &quot; Fazzini asked his audience . &quot; We would n ' t have to go_to Las Vegas if they would have built this. &quot; With the growth of modern architecture in the 1920s , Egyptian influences largely disappeared from large public buildings , but the discovery of King Tutankhamun ' s tomb in 1922 sparked a craze of Egyptian style in many smaller buildings -- most notably , for Los Angeles at least , in elaborate movie palaces . Grauman ' s Egyptian theater in Los Angeles , most of which has been destroyed , was the epitome . Southern California , particularly San Diego and Los Angeles , was a center for Egyptian-style structures , from apartments and bungalow courts to real_estate offices . &quot; For whatever reason , Los Angeles is Fantasyland . The same is true of San Diego , &quot; Fazzini said . Luxor &quot; is certainly , in a way , a descendant of the fancy movie palaces of the 1920s , &quot; he added . * Egyptomania goes_on today , even outside Las Vegas . Memphis , because of the name connection , has always been Egypt-crazy , even in the age of Elvis . The new city zoo is an elaborate adaptation of Egyptian design , and the new sports arena is a pyramid . Beyond architecture , there are other reflections of the craze , including a Utah company founded in the 1980s that mummifies its customers , going so far as_to put a mask of the deceased onto the sarcophagus lid and copyrighting the term &quot; mummification. &quot; Egyptomania has become a popular sideline for Fazzini . This month he goes_to Paris to lecture on the subject , in conjunction with an exhibit on Egyptomania on view at the Louvre . It all started , he said , after his lecture in Las Vegas , when patrons at the Brooklyn Museum began asking him questions about popular exotic myths of ancient Egypt . As a scholar , Fazzini said , he had been little aware of the common perceptions of Egyptian civilization . He started investigating , taking slides of Egyptian-influence buildings and haunting flea_markets and antique shops in search of Egyptian-style posters , lamps , clocks and other curios . &quot; People seem to find it an interesting lecture subject , &quot; he said . The invitation from the Orange County archeological group allowed him his first look_at Luxor , and he took the opportunity to snap slides for future lectures . When asked if the size and scope of the resort was more_than he expected , he shook his head . &quot; The first time I had ever seen the real pyramids , many years ago , that was more_than I had expected. &quot;</TEXT>
