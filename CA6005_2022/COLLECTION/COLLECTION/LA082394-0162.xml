   <HEADLINE> EXECUTIVE SUITE : COMPANY TOWN ; ZISKIN TO HEAD FOX PRODUCTION UNIT ; INCREASED OUTPUT SOUGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After weeks of speculation , producer Laura Ziskin was officially named Monday to run a new mainstream film production unit at 20th Century Fox that is aimed at boosting the studio ' s output by as_many as 12 movies a year . Ziskin , whose credits include &quot; Pretty Woman , &quot; &quot; No Way Out &quot; and &quot; Hero , &quot; had been rumored for some time to be moving to Fox to run the unit , which has yet to be named . Fox said it expects the unit to come_up with eight to 12 films a year . The deal is part of a major push by Fox to boost its output to about 30 films a year , in part to funnel more product into parent News Corp. ' s huge global television empire . In addition to the new Ziskin-run unit , Fox recently formed a family films unit , as well as Searchlight Pictures , which will produce and distribute films aimed at adults . Ziskin ' s division is expected to operate in concert with the current production unit run_by Tom Jacobson . Fox Chairman Peter Chernin said the separate unit is being set_up because boosting production under Jacobson could stretch the operation too thin . He added that Jacobson was involved in the process and that the new unit will not diminish his authority . * MCA Records has named Larry Jacobson director of recording administration and Chris Edwards director and administrator for soundtracks . * Rhino Records named Jenni Sperandeo national manager of radio and video promotion and William Smith promotion coordinator . * The Agency for the Performing Arts named Stuart Miller executive_vice_president and Jim Kellem and Lee Dinsman senior_vice_presidents . * Vision International has named Zsuzsa Cziraky vice_president of acquisitions and marketing and promoted Ted Perkins to director of international sales . * Virgin Records named George Maloian director of creative projects . * MGM / UA Telecommunications named Bill Lee senior_vice_president for worldwide pay television .</TEXT>
