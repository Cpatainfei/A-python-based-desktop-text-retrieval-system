   <HEADLINE> CLINTON HEALTH PANEL WEIGHED EXTREME VIEWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s ill-fated health reform agenda , which enraged his critics with its complex and massive federal regulatory role , was but a pale version of what his advisers once envisioned , according to internal White_House documents released Wednesday . The working papers of the White_House Task_Force on National Health_Care Reform , which the White_House fought to keep secret , showed that the group and its assorted sub-panels considered such measures as a &quot; user fee &quot; on cigarettes of $ 3 a pack , abolition of the Veterans Administration medical system and a reduction -- rather than a freeze -- on all medical fees . Among those that would have been affected by the price_controls were not only hospitals and doctors but also blood_banks , &quot; health resorts &quot; and even &quot; curative baths or spas operated separately from hospitals. &quot; The papers , contained in more_than 240 boxes delivered to the National Archives , also included the collective opinion of independent accountants that the President ' s advisers were overestimating the savings but downplaying the costs of their proposals . Public aversion to a vast expansion of the government ' s role in a restructured health_care system as well as the new spending that would be required by Clinton ' s plan to provide universal coverage were among the chief reasons that the President ' s agenda has been largely discarded by Congress . It is highly questionable whether any reform legislation , however modest and incremental , can be enacted in the remaining weeks of the current Congress . The internal documents were released by the White_House Wednesday as part of the pretrial proceedings of a federal lawsuit filed here against the Clinton_Administration by a group of conservative physicians alleging that the task_force went_about its work inappropriately by meeting behind closed doors . A trial is now set for later this year . The documents &quot; confirm what we suspected -- that special_interest groups were involved in writing the plan , &quot; said Dr. Jane Orient , executive_director of the American Assn . of Physicians and Surgeons , which sued the Administration . The task_force relied heavily on advice from &quot; academics , foundations and managed care organizations interested in reducing access to care through rationing , &quot; Orient said . But White_House Deputy Chief_of_Staff Harold M . Ickes disputed that characterization , saying that the 500-plus participants included &quot; doctors , nurses , academics , business people and federal , state and local officials. &quot; He added : &quot; In all , this was an unusually accessible process to discuss options for a major presidential policy proposal. &quot; Ickes also noted the documents &quot; make clear that numerous ideas and proposals for health reform were discussed , analyzed and challenged. &quot; The papers also revealed that the task_force considered but ultimately abandoned before presenting recommendations to the President : * Malpractice reforms that were being sought by physicians , which would limit to $ 250 # 000 the amount of damages for pain and suffering that a victim of malpractice could receive . * Restricting public access to technological innovations because &quot; unlimited &quot; access was &quot; unrealistic and unaffordable. &quot; * Abolishing the VA system because it is &quot; too costly and too inefficient. &quot; Containing costs was a recurring theme through much of the period that the task_force was engaged in its frenetic deliberations in the late winter and early spring of 1993 . For instance , during one crucial juncture in the policy development process , a paper was written with the heading : &quot; An Option to Freeze and Control Provider Prices. &quot; It proposed a sweeping price freeze , followed three to nine months later by &quot; a system that is flexible and enforceable. &quot; In another stage , price growth would be allowed , perhaps pegged to the rate_of_inflation . The paper also predicted a 50 % increase in business volume by doctors as a way to compensate for diminished income . Separately , the task_force considered extending government regulation to all fees charged by doctors and hospitals . Currently , the federal_government only sets rates under Medicare , the program for persons over 65 and the disabled , and under Medicaid , the federal-state health program for the poor . But rates vary considerably for the majority of Americans with private health_insurance . Another potential approach to restrain spending was a temporary surtax on doctors , dentists , hospitals , nursing_homes and medical laboratories . Any health provider with revenues greater than the previous year would pay a special tax , ranging from 2 % to 30 % , on the revenue increase . The tax would encourage doctors to take more days_off . &quot; By causing physicians to take more leisure , they may lead physicians to cut_back either patient loads or the intensity of services , &quot; according to one White_House paper . Among the documents available for examination Wednesday was a three-inch-thick briefing book prepared_for the President , the final product of untold thousands of hours of meetings . It had 31 tabular sections with subjects ranging from academic health centers to workers compensation . But missing were any papers on two of the most important topics : financing and insurance reforms . There was no explanation for the missing sections .</TEXT>
