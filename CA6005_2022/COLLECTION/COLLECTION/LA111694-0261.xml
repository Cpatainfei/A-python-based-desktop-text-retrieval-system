   <HEADLINE> POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; NEED INFO ? LET YOUR PC DO THE WALKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cyberspace is a great place to kill time . You can spend hours arguing about arcana with a 14-year-old in Fresno , or flaming poor_spellers and newbies in your favorite discussion forum . On the other hand , cyberspace is also a great place for saving time -- especially if you use on-line services for something they ' re very , very good at , which is finding things out . On-line services are just about the best way to look_up published material of almost any kind , especially if your time is valuable enough that you can ' t afford to waste it , but not so valuable that you have a staff to do your research . Cyberspace can thus become indispensable to anyone whose livelihood depends_upon information -- and more and more of us are in that category these days . There are several ways to find things out using a PC and a modem . The first and most time-honored method is to simply ask . That is , find a forum or bulletin_board_system where people knowledgeable_about , say , photography , tend to congregate . Then scan the postings to see if anyone has already addressed your question , and if not , go_ahead and post it yourself . Chances are you ' ll find_out what you need to know . For anybody with more serious information needs , I suggest a subscription to CompuServe . The granddaddy of the big on-line services is simply unsurpassed in its research offerings , and indispensable to anyone -- a lawyer practicing alone , a writer , a more-than-casual investor -- with an ongoing need for specific research . * CompuServe ' s &quot; basic &quot; service costs $ 8.95 a month , which includes some very handy research tools : an encyclopedia , a fine mutual_fund database , the ability to look_up stock prices and ticker symbols , Consumer Reports , and an excellent health and medical database called HealthNet . For slightly more per month , you can enroll in CompuServe ' s Executive News Service , which , among other things , functions as an automated clipping service . Let ' s say you ' re interested in trade with Senegal ; you can tell ENS to comb its various news sources -- including the Washington Post newspaper -- for &quot; trade &quot; and &quot; Senegal , &quot; and it will pull any article mentioning both terms . There are hourly charges for reading the material , though . CompuServe also offers several ways of locating individuals or businesses nationwide , including PhoneFile and Computrace ; at 25 cents a minute , they can be cheaper than directory assistance , especially if you don ' t know the city . Where CompuServe really shines is as a gateway to major databases of all kinds , which you can search for a fee . For investors and others interested in business , there are a host of resources , from reports on individual companies to demographic data . Of perhaps more interest to lay users are the roughly 3 # 300 publications CompuServe offers through a variety of commercial databases . Although some of the databases are frighteningly expensive , some of them are not . Besides , how expensive is a $ 10 or $ 20 database search ? When I visit any of the UCLA libraries , for example , it means an hour round-trip in the car , to say nothing of hunting_down hard_copies or microfiches of the articles I need . And don ' t forget the dollar ' s worth of gas and $ 5 that UCLA charges for parking . Using my computer , I can get what I need in minutes , without leaving home . * The array of CompuServe ' s extra-charge offerings is truly gigantic . Just browsing those beginning with the letter F , you ' ll find FCC Report , the Federal Register , Fertility and Sterility , Fiber Optics News , Financial Analysts ' Journal , the Financial Times , Finnish Trade Review , Fish Farming International , Floor_Covering Business , Flame Retardancy News , Forbes , Fortune , the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , the Fresno Bee , Frozen Food Age and many others . Let there be no mistake : You can spend a pretty penny searching through back issues of Progressive Grocer on CompuServe . In some databases , in fact , you can run_up charges of hundreds of dollars awfully fast . But there are ways to save . My two favorites on CompuServe are Knowledge Index ( GO KI ) and Magazine Database Plus ( GO MAGDB ) . Knowledge Index is the first place to check for most things , because at 40 cents a minute it is much cheaper than the other databases . &quot; A 15-minute search on KI , costing $ 6 , could cost 10 times as much using other CompuServe sources , &quot; wrote Glenn and Ruth Orenstein , authors and publishers of a very useful book called &quot; CompuServe Companion : Finding Newspapers and Magazines Online &quot; ( $ 29.95 , ( 617 ) 444-1154 ) . KI has something like 700 periodicals available on-line , including many major ( and not so major ) newspapers . It ' s also easy to use . The catch is that you can only use it nights and weekends ; during business hours there is sufficient demand for the Dialog information retrieval service , of which KI is the after-hours offspring . * Magazine Database Plus , according to CompuServe , &quot; contains the full text of articles from more_than 140 general-interest publications , including U.S. News &amp; World Report , Entertainment Weekly , Forbes and Motor Trend. &quot; It ' s also easy . Searching is free , and each full-text article you view , print or download is $ 1.50. For $ 4.50 , I recently located and downloaded three articles I needed , including a long one from Scientific American . Overall , says Ruth Orenstein , CompuServe carries 3 # 300 titles , with only a_few glaring gaps . Daniel Akst , a Los Angeles writer , is a former assistant business_editor for technology at The Times . He welcomes electronic messages at akstd.news.latimes.com but regrets that he cannot reply to them all .</TEXT>
