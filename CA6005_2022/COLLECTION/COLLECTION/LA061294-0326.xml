   <HEADLINE> U.S. DRAFTS COMPROMISE ON N . KOREA ; ASIA : PLAN TO BE SUBMITTED TO U.N. THIS WEEK WOULD FIRST TARGET SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES IF PYONGYANG CONTINUES TO DEFY NUCLEAR INSPECTORS . GOAL IS TO ENLIST CRITICAL PLAYERS , LIKE JAPAN , AND FORESTALL CHINESE VETO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States has prepared a draft resolution designed to pressure North_Korea by further isolating it in cultural , scientific and diplomatic areas , but it falls_short_of immediate full economic sanctions , U.S. officials said Saturday . The resolution , to be submitted to the United Nations this week , would apply stiffer sanctions at a later date if the regime of President Kim Il Sung continues to prevent international inspections of its nuclear facilities . The &quot; phased &quot; sanctions plan , which is being hammered_out this weekend by the Clinton_Administration , is effectively a compromise designed to guarantee support from reticent but critical players in the escalating drama , notably Japan , and to ensure that China does not veto the plan . As one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security_Council , China has the power to veto any resolution that comes_before it . Beijing has long been Pyongyang ' s closest ally and has repeatedly declared its opposition to an international economic embargo against North_Korea . While China still may_not vote for a sanctions resolution , U.S. officials hope it will at least abstain in any U.N. vote . The goal of the draft resolution is to spell_out the costs of repudiating the International Atomic Energy Agency , which is seeking the nuclear inspections , without imposing stiff measures that might lead North_Korea to take even more dangerous steps , a U.S. official said Saturday . &quot; We want to make a serious response without throwing the baby out with the bathwater . So we ' ll hold_in reserve a much tougher set of sanctions that will bite economically , &quot; he said . The mild sanctions in the first phase of the proposed sanctions could include stopping scientific and cultural exchanges and halting U.N. technical assistance . The U.S. strategy is a step back from a tougher package developed by the Clinton_Administration after North_Korea stalled long enough to prevent an IAEA team from inspecting samplings from a nuclear_reactor -- evidence that could indicate the scope of a suspected nuclear_weapons program . Pyongyang has denied that it has any nuclear_warheads , but the CIA estimates that it has already manufactured enough weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two nuclear bombs . The new strategy would basically offer North_Korea a choice between further sanctions that would devastate its already troubled economy and financial incentives to help bail it out . And North_Korea has signaled that it might be open_to compromise . An American scholar who met with Kim last week said the regime has offered to &quot; freeze &quot; operations of two key nuclear facilities suspected of producing weapons-grade plutonium in return for help in acquiring safer , more modern nuclear technology . Selig Harrison , Asia specialist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said Saturday in Beijing that several senior North_Korean officials , including Kim , have told him of their readiness to halt operations at the two controversial nuclear facilities that have graphite-based reactors . According to experts , alternative &quot; light water &quot; reactors are safer and much more difficult to use as a source of weapons-grade plutonium . Although construction of new reactors could take as long as eight years , Harrison said the North_Koreans offered to &quot; suspend &quot; the operations of the graphite facilities as soon as an agreement could be reached to replace them . The draft of the sanctions resolution , which U.S. officials cautioned may undergo changes before it is presented at the United Nations as early as midweek , follows a week of intense consultations between the United States and its allies . In Istanbul , the Turkish_capital , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher attended a NATO summit and held talks Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev and others . Those talks led to another compromise as Washington agreed to reward North_Korea with an international conference , which would discuss economic incentives and symbolize its re-entry into the world community , if Pyongyang complies with the IAEA . On Saturday , Japan promised to support sanctions against North_Korea , whether imposed by the Security_Council or in a separate alliance with the United States . &quot; There would be no choice but for Japan to cooperate , &quot; Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said in a speech in Hamamatsu , Japan . He called the decision a matter of &quot; whether to continue or to abandon the nearly 50 years of post-World War II prosperity brought_on by the U.S.-Japan alliance. &quot; Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa , meeting with his South_Korean counterpart , Han Sung Joo , in Seoul , said , &quot; Japan regards suspicions of North_Korea ' s development of nuclear_weapons as an issue of concern to Japan itself. &quot; But he added , &quot; It is important to keep_open the door to dialogue with North_Korea , &quot; stressing his government ' s desire for a milder approach at first . Kakizawa leaves for Beijing today to add_to appeals that China not block any punitive measures . In a separate meeting in Seoul , U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff and South_Korean Unification Minister Lee Hong Ku also backed the step-by-step sanctions approach . The strategy fits_in with what key U.S. officials have been saying over the past two days . &quot; Sanctions are not an end . They are a tool so that we can make_sure of several things , &quot; Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said Friday on the &quot; MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour. &quot; &quot; One is that we want the North_Koreans to come_back to the negotiating table . We want to set_up some way to reconstruct this history . . . . But the more important part of this is to protect the future , so that we can make_sure they do not have the capability to make more weapons-grade material and weapons themselves , &quot; she said . Times staff writers Rone Tempest in Beijing and Sam Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this report .</TEXT>
