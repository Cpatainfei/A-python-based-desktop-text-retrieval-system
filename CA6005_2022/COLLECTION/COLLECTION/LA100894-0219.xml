   <HEADLINE> ENDANGERED MOUSE WON ' T ENDANGER RESORT ; DEVELOPMENT : THE DANA POINT HEADLANDS PROJECT CAN ACCOMMODATE THE FEDERALLY PROTECTED SPECIES , PLANNERS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The placement of the Pacific pocket_mouse on the federal endangered species list will have no major effect on a proposed $ 500-million resort at the Dana Point Headlands , a development spokesman said Friday . &quot; We fully anticipated the listing during the planning process to accommodate the permanent listing of the pocket_mouse , &quot; said Jeffrey Adler , a spokesman for the two property_owners , S . H . Sherman Co . of Newport Beach and the Pasadena-based Chandis Securities Co . About three dozen pocket_mice , believed to be the last members of the species worldwide , have been detected on 3.75 acres on the headlands , a peninsula just north of Dana Point Harbor . On Sept . 26 , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service put the mice on the endangered list . The rodents already had been placed there on an emergency basis last spring for a 240-day period that ended Sept . 28 . The developers ' plans include three alternatives for the pocket_mice , Adler said : They can be relocated on or off the site , or the project area can be moved to accommodate their current habitat . With the mouse ' s placement on the endangered list , developers will not be allowed to proceed without first convincing the service that construction would not further endanger the mouse . &quot; Being_on the federal endangered species list means that the mouse is now protected , &quot; said Loren Hays , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman . &quot; You cannot harm or harass them unless you have a prescribed permit . And you get a permit by applying through the Fish and Wildlife Service. &quot; No permit application has been submitted , Hays said . Plans call_for a 400-room luxury hotel and 370 homes with sweeping ocean vistas on 121 acres . Recently , property_owners and the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy have met privately to discuss saving part of the headlands . Conservancy officials have told owners they would like to buy about nine acres of the most prominent , environmentally sensitive land at the tip of the peninsula , including the habitat of the endangered mice . In addition , the conservancy would want a five-year option to buy an additional 12 acres , which is now the proposed location of the hotel . Approved in April by the City_Council , the Headlands project has been the target of protests by residents who contend the development is too extensive and will destroy one of the county ' s last undeveloped coastal properties . The approved plan is the subject of two heated citywide November ballot measures that could force the council to rescind its approval . Now that the mouse is listed as endangered , money may be available through the federal Land and Water Acquisition Fund to preserve the headlands , said Jacqueline Cain , a conservancy director . &quot; We got_into this late in the game . The land is for_sale and we believe that this is our last chance to come_up with federal , state or county bonds to purchase the point for preservation , &quot; she said . Chandis Securities , which oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family , is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co. , publisher of the Los Angeles Times .</TEXT>
