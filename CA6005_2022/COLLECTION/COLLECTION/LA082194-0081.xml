   <HEADLINE> HAIRY VETCH FREES FARMS OF PLASTIC MANTLE ; ECOLOGY : RESEARCHER USES COVER_CROP AS A WAY TO KEEP WEEDS DOWN AND MOISTURE IN THE SOIL . IT ALSO BOOSTS PLANT YIELDS AND MAKES CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS UNNECESSARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every year , Florida vegetable farmers lay enough plastic sheeting on fields to tie a black cummerbund 90 times around Earth . Plant physiologist Aref Abdul-Baki believes he has a better way to keep weeds down and moisture in the soil . For the past five autumns , the Department_of_Agriculture scientist has planted hairy_vetch , a winter annual cover_crop . Every spring , he mows the crop and grows long rows of tomato_plants that are greener , bushier and produce more fruit than those grown under plastic . &quot; You are not adding anything to the soil by using that plastic , &quot; Abdul-Baki said , and the plastic isn ' t biodegradable . &quot; Where are we going_to bury it ? &quot; Plastic is the most commonly used ground_cover in commercial vegetable farming . Florida farmers alone use enough plastic every year to stretch about 2 million miles , Abdul-Baki said . Long before the era of plastic , the Romans and ancient_Greeks used hairy_vetch as &quot; green_manure , &quot; plowing it into their fields , said Abdul-Baki , who won an Agricultural Research Service award in July for his vetch research . At the Agricultural Research_Center in Beltsville , the cover_crop , which resembles a shaggy vine and can grow branches up_to 7 feet long , is planted in the fall . It is mowed in early May , the same day seeds are planted , and left on top of the soil , keeping weeds down and moisture in , he said . As the ground_cover decomposes , it nourishes the soil -- so_much so , Abdul-Baki said , that it makes chemical fertilizers unnecessary . The plants grown on the hairy_vetch look healthier and have more foliage -- which hides extra fruit , Abdul-Baki said . The plants grown in plastic-covered earth appear less robust , with wilted bottom leaves . In the five years Abdul-Baki has conducted the experiment , never have the tomato_plants grown on vetch had a worse yield than those grown using plastic . &quot; The best year , we had twice as much yield under hairy_vetch as under plastic , &quot; he said . And there ' s another benefit to using hairy_vetch . It ' s cheaper . Buying , installing and removing the plastic costs farmers about $ 750 per acre , Abdul-Baki said . The vetch costs about $ 35 an acre to plant and saves on fertilizer costs . &quot; It wasn ' t until I started doing the vetch that I really started taking_off , &quot; said Norma Wilson , who has operated a small organic farm in Lovettsville , Va. , for eight years . &quot; There ' s so many positives to using it. &quot; The vetch , which she has used for the last two years on tomatoes , corn and squash , reduced her overhead and allowed her to put more resources into marketing her vegetables , Wilson said . The ground_cover is also &quot; a haven for the beneficial insects &quot; who then keep the &quot; bad_guys &quot; off her vegetables , she said . Maybe more important for Wilson , the vetch ' s root system holds onto the nitrogen in the soil , reducing the amount that runs_into the nearby Potomac_River and flows down to the Chesapeake Bay , she said . The method also has its place on larger commercial farms . &quot; We ' re actively looking_for better ways to grow our crops that are more environmentally friendly , &quot; said Brennan Starkey of Starkey Farms on the Eastern Shore . Hairy vetch is one of the options being considered , he said . The 2 # 000-acre commercial farm , which sells produce to stands and supermarkets , this year tried the vetch method on about 20 % of the tomato crop , Starkey said . Next year , the farm could use it on part of the sweet_corn crop , he said . &quot; We ' re impressed with what we ' ve seen so far , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
