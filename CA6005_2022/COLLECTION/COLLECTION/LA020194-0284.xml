   <HEADLINE> HOSOKAWA -- STILL STANDING ; JAPANESE PRIME_MINISTER EMERGES FROM A BRUTAL POLITICAL BATTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is still on course in his campaign to lead Japan into a new political era . His victory in securing significant political reform signals a changing Japan that may at long last put consumer interests ahead of Japan Inc. Should that shift occur , Tokyo will find it a popular and pragmatic move , and not just in Japan . After more_than five years of seemingly endless debate over political reform , Parliament finally passed a mild reform package last Saturday . It is short of the sweeping initiative Hosokawa sought at first , but it overhauls Japan ' s electoral_system and puts some limits on political donations . Hosokawa ' s reformist efforts extend well beyond these changes . His coalition government virtually has upended the traditional style of Japanese politics , back-room dealings and party alliances . Voters are being listened to , and the public prosecutor ' s office is aggressively rooting_out corruption . Having achieved his first priority , political reform , Hosokawa now turns_to economic problems at_home and to stalemated U.S.-Japan trade talks . This week he is expected to unveil a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government spending , a major effort to stimulate the ailing economy . Will reformist Hosokawa make any difference in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations ? In public , he has taken a less than conciliatory tone on the basic points of disagreement . But during his few months in office Japan has agreed to open its rice market to imports and to increase foreign access to public work projects . Both will benefit U.S. businesses . The next step is to push Japan ' s bureaucrats to reduce the $ 50-billion trade imbalance with the United States . Still , when Hosokawa arrives for his Feb . 11 meeting with President Clinton he must be bearing more_than the traditional &quot; gifts &quot; of a tax cut and vague trade promises . That was pro_forma for old Japan . His new Japan must deliver substantive commitments on trade .</TEXT>
