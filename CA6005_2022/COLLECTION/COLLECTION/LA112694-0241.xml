   <HEADLINE> FOCUSING_ON A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH FOR THE ON-AIR TALENT ; TELEVISION : A VIDEO CAMERA IN USE AT MORE THAN 30 STATIONS WILL ELECTRONICALLY BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO THE CAREERS OF AGING NEWS ANCHORS , ACCORDING TO INVENTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine looking five , 10 , maybe even 15 years younger without having to use messy creams , painful collagen injections , plastic_surgery or even makeup . That day is here . The only problem : It only works when you appear on TV . An Emmy Award-winning video camera currently in_use at more_than 30 stations across the country will electronically breathe new life into the careers of many aging news anchors , according to those responsible_for inventing it . &quot; One anchor in her 50s at a TV_station in the Midwest was so amazed at the transformation that now she won ' t go_on the air without it , &quot; said Greg Pine , marketing manager of Broadcast Television_Systems , one of the largest manufacturers of professional broadcasting equipment . While age and experience give an anchor a desired credibility with his or her audience , viewers do not want to see their trusted news person grow old , Pine said . From the perspective of his customers , he added , ratings and revenue can be affected by such perceptions . And with the images on TV screens getting larger and sharper , viewers are able to see more clearly each wrinkle , spot and blemish on a news anchor ' s face . In the past , stations have used filters , fine mesh nets behind the camera_lens , even Vaseline to soften the harsh effects of video on their news personalities . But though such gimmicks can make a person look somewhat better , they also fuzz up the news set . The computer_technology in the &quot; fountain-of-youth camera , &quot; on the other hand , adjusts the skin tone and smoothes_out the look of just the faces , while leaving the background and the set unchanged . Lines and wrinkles on the forehead and around the eyes and mouth are diminished , dark or blotchy spots and patches blend evenly into the rest of the face , even a man ' s 5-o ' clock shadow becomes an unnoticeable 1-o ' clock shadow . Wayne Kube , engineering manager at WFAA-TV , an ABC affiliate in Dallas that replaced 11-year-old studio cameras with six of the BTS models about a year ago , said that the cameras are so_much better that viewers and staffers have commented mostly on how much better the whole picture looks . But he confirmed that wrinkles on the faces of the anchor people are lessened when they appear on camera -- and anything a station &quot; can do to make a newscast look better will certainly help ratings. &quot; &quot; And the anchors do like it , &quot; Kube said . &quot; Before , they were prone to comment about how old they looked_on video , and that really bothered them . Now they aren ' t complaining anymore. &quot; BTS didn ' t invent the technology . RCA was developing a similar system 10 years ago , but the company left the television_equipment business in 1985 before getting_it_on the market . Ikegami Electronics , one of BTS ' major competitors , actually beat BTS by about a year with a camera that makes people appear more youthful . That camera is part of the reason Dan Rather looks better on the &quot; CBS Evening News &quot; set than he does when out_in the field or when anchoring &quot; 48 Hours , &quot; which is shot on a different set with a different camera . But the Ikegami camera works_on only one person at a time and it must be operated manually . The BTS camera , which sells for about $ 100 # 000 , can simultaneously adjust the appearance of two people -- two anchors sitting side-by-side , for example -- and it works automatically at the push of a button ( or manually , for finer shading and contouring ) . Last month , the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences awarded a technical Emmy to both BTS and Ikegami for this camera technology . No station in Los Angeles has purchased the camera , but Pine said he is in negotiations with a_couple_of them . So if your favorite elder_statesman suddenly starts to look less like your grandfather , you ' ll know why -- although generally the hues and contours of the anchor person ' s face are adjusted gradually over a month or two so that the change comes_about subtly and almost imperceptibly , sort of like Grecian Formula . It ' s obviously not as extreme as Max Headroom -- the fictional , computer-generated TV_newsman . But it is , in a sense , altering reality in a place where truth , not artifice , is supposed to be paramount . BTS executives argue that cameras have nothing to do with editorial decisions . &quot; If this is artifice , then so is using makeup , or lighting the set_in a certain way , or a director using a longer_shot on somebody rather than getting_in for a close-up , &quot; said Skip Ferderber , a BTS spokesman . &quot; It ' s not faking anything . Making people look better is simply a part of the art of production. &quot; KFAA ' s Kube agreed . &quot; It ' s really nothing more_than a really good makeup job , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
