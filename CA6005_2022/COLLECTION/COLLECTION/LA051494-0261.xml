   <HEADLINE> PROBLEMS MOUNT FOR MCNALL ; FINANCE : BANKS CLAIMING TO BE OWED NEARLY $ 162 MILLION BY KING OWNER SEEK TO LIQUIDATE HIS ASSETS AND FORCE HIM INTO PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three banks claiming to be owed nearly $ 162 million by King owner Bruce McNall moved late Friday to force the sports mogul into personal bankruptcy proceedings , an action that threatens to scuttle his deal to sell a majority of his hockey_team , The Times has learned . The three banks are the_French bank Credit Lyonnais , Dutch-owned European American Bank and IBJ Schroder , a unit of the Industrial Bank_of_Japan . The three are seeking to have McNall ' s assets liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . Credit Lyonnais is by far the largest creditor , listing $ 121 million in loans to a movie producing operation , horse_racing businesses and a coin firm . European American listed $ 31.4 million in a loan to McNall , and IBJ listed $ 9.2 million owed for loans on McNall ' s horse_racing interests . The loans are largely unsecured . In a statement on behalf of the three creditors , a Credit Lyonnais spokesman said : &quot; We have had protracted negotiations with McNall that have not produced a satisfactory resolution for all creditors . The purpose of this action is to make_sure that all assets of McNall ' s are available to his creditors on an equitable basis. &quot; McNall can legally contest the filing for involuntary bankruptcy , and a bankruptcy judge must accept the petition . But experts said that acceptance is likely to be only a formality . Should the Kings and other McNall operations be placed under bankruptcy proceedings , it would mark the first time such a thing has happened to a major Los Angeles sports franchise . It also would be the first time since the 1970s that an NHL team would be involved in bankruptcy proceedings . In a statement , an attorney for McNall called the filing &quot; precipitous and uncalled for. &quot; The lawyer added that McNall &quot; has been exerting herculean efforts to maximize the value of his assets for his creditors ' benefit &quot; and that he &quot; intends to continue his efforts to maximize repayment to his creditors , which has always been his primary objective. &quot; The filing clearly throws into doubt the sale of the Kings , which all_of the parties involved were aiming to close as early as Monday . As previously reported , McNall is trying to sell a 72 % interest in the team for $ 60 million to telecommunications executive Jeffrey P . Sudikoff and entertainment executive Joseph M . Cohen as part of a plan to rid McNall of a $ 92-million loan owed Bank of America . McNall ' s remaining 28 % would be put into a trust , with a percentage of cash generated by the Kings used to pay_off some_other creditors . Sources said that Bank of America -- which is financing the transaction temporarily -- could still use its leverage as a secured creditor to push for the sale regardless of the petition , although Credit Lyonnais and the other banks could seek a court_order to stop it . A Bank of America spokesman declined comment . Prospective buyer Sudikoff also declined to comment on the impact of the filing . There are several immediate concerns should the sale remain in limbo for any length of time . Sudikoff and Cohen already spent more_than $ 4 million covering the Kings ' payroll during the season . The next payroll is_due on Monday but appears to be covered through monies due the team from the Forum ' s Senate Seat program , sources told The Times . During the last pay period -- in which the club was late in issuing paychecks by two days -- Cohen said he approached Laker and Forum owner Jerry Buss and received the Senate Seat money to cover payroll . &quot; He didn ' t have to do_it , he was a gentleman about it , &quot; Cohen said of Buss . &quot; If he hadn ' t done_it , we would have met payroll ourselves. &quot; Front-office staff , coaches and players that are paid all year , rather than seasonally , were affected . One prominent player confirmed that he was paid late but requested anonymity . Separately , Wayne Gretzky ' s new contract calls_for seven-figure payments at the end of June and the end of August . Gretzky had offered to defer his payments , so that he could be paid_out of playoff revenue , thereby lessening the cash-flow problems during the season . But the Kings did not make the playoffs . Another pressing matter is the refund of money due fans for playoff tickets . Approximately $ 4 million was collected from fans who wanted playoff tickets . Season ticket-holders traditionally have the option of a refund or rolling the money over toward the purchase of 1994-95 season_tickets . The Kings ' season ended April 14 . There is no NHL policy regarding the handling of playoff refunds or deadlines for that to be done , and different teams have different policies . For instance , the Mighty Ducks and the Tampa Bay Lightning did not send_out invoices for playoff money during the season . In late January , the Kings sent_out a letter requesting a 75 % payment on or before Feb . 25 . The delay in refunds has been a point of contention for fans , who have been told they will receive their money once the sale of the Kings closes . Now , that close could be a long_time coming . As previously reported , McNall ' s financial_condition -- hurt by such factors as a large debt and a soft rare coin market -- has been deteriorating rapidly . In addition , a McNall lawyer has confirmed that McNall is under investigation by a federal grand_jury for allegedly falsifying loan documents . Sources familiar_with McNall ' s finances told The Times Friday that his overall debt is as much as $ 330 million . McNall has disputed his liability on some of that amount , in particular $ 96 million owed to Credit Lyonnais by Gladden Entertainment , a movie production company he jointly owned with longtime Hollywood executive David Begelman . McNall says he owns only 10 % of Gladden . A source close to Credit Lyonnais , however , said the bank maintains that McNall entered into an earlier agreement that would make him responsible_for the debt . The filing comes amid tense negotiations between creditors and McNall . Sources close to the negotiations cited two reasons for the filing Friday : growing frustration in getting details from McNall ' s advisers and a feeling that favoritism was being shown some smaller creditors . McNall , for example , reached an agreement in February to settle a lawsuit filed by his partners in Beverly Hills-based Superior Stamp and Coin who had accused him of misusing company funds . &quot; It was urgent . It was partly because of the sale , but it was just time . There was a need to get control of the process , &quot; one creditor said . NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman had little to say about the development Friday night . Said Bettman : &quot; My understanding is that this is a personal financial_condition relating to Bruce . This isn ' t about the Kings . I ' m not overly concerned about it affecting the Kings . I hope he ( McNall ) can sort it out. &quot; The McNall Saga : * Latest Action : Three banks move to force McNall into personal bankruptcy . * Why : To try to recover some of the nearly $ 162 million they claim McNall owes them . * Impact : The action could threaten McNall ' s effort to sell a majority interest in the Kings .</TEXT>
