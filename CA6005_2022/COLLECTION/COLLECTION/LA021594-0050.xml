   <HEADLINE> FANTASTIC FINNS ROUT RUSSIANS , 5-0 ; HOCKEY : BIG RED-FACED MACHINE HANDED ITS WORST OLYMPIC DEFEAT BY CONFIDENT FINLAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new_world order is dawning in hockey , signaling the end of the Big Red Machine and the rise of the glacial blue and arctic white of Finland . The Finns , who long lacked the assurance to match their world-class skills , scored the most significant victory in their hockey history Monday with a 5-0 rout of top-seeded Russia . It was the first Olympic shutout , and worst defeat absorbed by a Soviet team or its descendants . In other Group_B games Monday , Germany improved to 2-0 with a 2-1 victory over Norway , and the Czech Republic defeated Austria , 7-3 . The Soviet_Union won seven of nine gold medals from their Olympic debut in 1956 through 1988 ; the Unified Team , born after the Soviet dissolution , continued the tradition in 1992 . Together , the Soviet teams and the Unified Team were 60-6-2 and had lost only once by more_than a goal , an 8-5 defeat by Canada in 1960 . Russia won its tournament opener Saturday against Norway but was overwhelmed Monday . The seventh-seeded Finns have never won an Olympic or world championship , but they have impressively defeated two higher-seeded opponents here . Finland opened Olympic play Saturday with a 3-1 victory over the Czech Republic , the tournament ' s third-seeded team . &quot; We ' re really happy about it ( because ) I don ' t think you have so many chances to shut the Russians out , &quot; said Finnish right_wing Mikko Makela , a former King . Makela set_up the fourth goal with a perfect pass from behind the net to Janne Ojanen , who slipped a backhander between the legs of goaltender Andrei Zuev . &quot; We did a good thing tonight and we have a chance to do_well , but we only have played two games and we still have seven more , &quot; Makela said . &quot; We never had confidence before , but now we have some NHL experience ( on ) our team and that has helped us . We try to tell the young players they are something , because they are . Now , we play a mental game more_than we ever did before. &quot; Every facet of their game was superb Monday . They neutralized seven Russian power_plays , built a 28-11 edge_in shots on goal and produced several goals that would make the highlight film of any hockey_league . &quot; The Finnish team was stronger and faster today , &quot; said Igor Dmitriev , Russia ' s assistant coach . &quot; We were not ready for this level of play . . . . The game of our goalie ( who was replaced by Sergei Abramov after two periods ) was not so bad . The game of the old ( experienced ) guys was not so good and not good for this level of play. &quot; It was a lofty level , three fast and exciting periods in which the Finns used the broad ice surface -- 100 feet wide , 15 feet wider than most NHL rinks -- to outskate the Russians . If the 8 # 751 in Hakon Hall were entertained by Finland ' s first goal , a backhander by Jere Lehtinen while in a crowd in front of the net , they were dazzled by the second goal . It was a brilliant sequence that started when Janne Laukkanen intercepted a pass_by defenseman Sergei Sorokine along the right-wing boards in Russia ' s defensive zone . Laukkanen found Ville Peltonen in the left faceoff circle , and Peltonen made a quick pass to Saku Koivu , the Montreal Canadiens ' top draft pick last June , for a dead-on shot from the slot . The Finns ' 1-7 Olympic record against Soviet teams was forgotten Monday . Mika Alatalo gave Finland a 3-0 lead with his 12-foot rebound at 11:32 of the second_period . Ojanen , a former New Jersey Devil , added a flourish with his second tournament goal , at 19:03 , and defenseman Marko Kiprusov turned the game into a rout 10 seconds later . &quot; We are very , very satisfied with the team now , &quot; Finnish assistant coach Hannu Aravarta said . &quot; It ' s almost touching how the players are fighting for pucks . They are giving 110 % . &quot; Finland owes much of its success to first-year Coach Curt Lindstrom , a Swede who formerly coached the Swedish national team . Lindstrom has instilled confidence in Finn players through constant positive reinforcement . &quot; I ' m working very much since training camp in August with individual discussions to make them stronger mentally , &quot; Lindstrom said . &quot; My main key_word is not only self-confidence but confidence ( in_general ) . I try to give them confidence and an understanding they must take responsibility . &quot; They work with heart now . Skills , we have . I try to tell them they are good_enough to beat any team. &quot; Without question , they were good_enough Monday .</TEXT>
