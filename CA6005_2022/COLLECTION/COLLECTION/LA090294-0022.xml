   <HEADLINE> PEREZ VOWS NEW IMAGE FOR PANAMA PARTY ; LATIN_AMERICA : PRESIDENT SWORN IN , PLEDGES TO ' CLOSE THE UNFORTUNATE CHAPTER ' OF THE NORIEGA YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernesto Perez Balladares -- eager to polish the image of his once-disgraced political_party -- was sworn_in Thursday as president of a still-polarized Panama and vowed to &quot; close the unfortunate chapter &quot; of the dictatorship of Manuel Antonio Noriega . The inauguration of Perez , 48 , a U.S.-trained banker , marked the return to power of the Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , Noriega ' s political arm until his ouster in a 1989 U.S. military invasion . But Perez has sought to portray the Noriega years as an &quot; aberration &quot; and claims his party is reformed and committed to democracy . A number of Noriega ' s old cronies have roles in the government , however , and some diplomats and opposition politicians remain skeptical . In one of his first acts_as president , Perez announced pardons for dozens of jailed collaborators of the Noriega regime . Although it was unclear how extensive the pardons will be -- Perez listed several conditions for them -- those in jail include military_officers accused or convicted of human_rights violations and the murders of a priest and one of Noriega ' s harshest critics . &quot; It is critical that we close now the unfortunate chapter of Noriega and the persecution that followed the invasion , &quot; Perez said after taking the oath of office before dignitaries from 40 countries . He pledged to avoid the &quot; judicial terrorism &quot; that some members of the PRD feel they fell victim to after the invasion and the installation of the right-wing government of outgoing President Guillermo Endara . Despite the PRD ' s military history -- it was founded by strongman Gen . Omar Torrijos , who was killed in a 1981 plane crash -- Perez pledged to build a government free_of militarism . &quot; This is the new face that Panama is presenting to its foreign friends , &quot; he said . * The PRD-dominated national legislature on Thursday also elected Balbina Herrera as its president . Herrera , a staunch Noriega ally to the end , was the mayor of San Miguelito , a bastion of Noriega support before and after the invasion and led demonstrations against then-President George_Bush in 1991 that turned violent . &quot; I must hail the Democratic Revolutionary Party , a party that could not be destroyed , a party that could not be conquered , &quot; she proclaimed in her inaugural speech . Perez announced he would increase the size of Panama ' s police_forces , rebuilt after the invading American troops dismantled the Panamanian army . Perez is also seeking to curry U.S. favor by agreeing to accept up_to 10 # 000 Cuban refugees . A formal agreement is expected to be announced today . Perez won the election May 8 , promising to do more for Panama ' s poor . Two-thirds of the electorate voted for other candidates , including salsa star and actor Ruben Blades .</TEXT>
