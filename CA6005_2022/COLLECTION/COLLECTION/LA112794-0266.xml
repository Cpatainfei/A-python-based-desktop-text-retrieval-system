   <HEADLINE> NIGHT HOWLS ; EVEN WITH LITTLE CASH AND NO WHEELS , KIDS FIND PLENTY TO DO ON A FRIDAY EVENING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Come nightfall in Ventura County , teen-agers drift into that awkward , cash-poor limbo between living at_home and leaving home : Hanging out . Clustering at football games , video arcades and shopping_malls from Ventura to Simi Valley , they wolf junk food , share gossip and ogle the opposite sex . And all across the county , they complain : &quot; I ' m so bored , there ' s nothing to do_in this town ! &quot; Yet , youth counselors say , Ventura County has plenty of things for teen-agers to do . Hanging out is a way of searching for purpose in life , a crowd to fit_in with , a niche in the grown-up world . And the universal teen-age gripe , they say , is just part of that search . &quot; There ' s nothing to do . They ' ve been saying that for years and years and years , &quot; said Toni Garubo , a guidance counselor at Adolfo Camarillo High_School . &quot; It doesn ' t seem to matter whether there really is anything to do . For the person who complains , they usually would n ' t do anything even if you gave them a list. &quot; All people -- particularly teen-agers -- yearn for a sense of belonging , said Carol Walker , a Westlake Village family therapist . &quot; Kids that age like a lot of excitement and a lot of adventure , and wherever kids are , they often feel it ' s kind of boring , &quot; she said . &quot; Parents worry that kids hang_out to use drugs , and sometimes they do . . . . But it ' s a very natural , developmental thing for teen-agers to want to hang_out and just talk. &quot; In fact , with little money , no wheels and no particular place to go_on a Friday night , Ventura County ' s teen-agers find plenty to do . Girls cruise The Oaks mall to check_out the latest fashions and eye cute boys . Boys pound on glaring , booming video_games in Ventura , straining to beat each other ' s high scores . Self-described weirdos preen and thrash in the glorious noise of a punk band in Simi Valley . Teen-age couples in most towns park somewhere dark and neck . And outside an Oxnard Taco Bell , high schoolers shiver at the cold and wonder whether anyone ' s throwing a party tonight . Most teen-agers ' formula for a good time is open-ended , but precise : &quot; What we look_for is a . . . place where your parents can ' t see you and you can smoke , &quot; said Jane Johnson , 16 , a Westlake High junior dragging_on a cigarette outside the Vampyre Lounge Cafe in Simi Valley . &quot; We look_for a place with no parents , where nothing bad happens and there ' s no little gang bangers. &quot; By most accounts , the Vampyre is just such a place . * Owners and patrons say that some Simi Valley preachers condemn the Vampyre as a temple of sin where Satan worshipers offer animal sacrifices to the_devil . In fact , it is only a coffeehouse in a strip mall . Even Simi Valley beat cops say it is safe and its young patrons are mostly well-behaved . And by 9 p.m. most Fridays -- like this night -- it is packed with kids and thumping with music . &quot; THERE WAS A BOY , &quot; wails the lead singer for Sienna , throttling power chords out of a beaten Gibson Les Paul . &quot; HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE TELEVISION. &quot; One shaggy boy in baggy overalls jogs furiously in place , flailing his head and fists to the beat . Another , 15 feet from the shattering noise of the drums , dozes in an armchair . Teen-agers in heavy makeup and offbeat threads lounge in battered armchairs , nodding in rhythm and occasionally shouting comments to each other . A $ 4 cover fee buys thrash , ska , speedcore and blues music from two live bands on many weekend nights , and the privilege of getting a little wild without grown-ups jumping down their throats . Outside , draped on cars and curbs , kids smoke , roughhouse and gossip . Two girls slap playfully at each other ' s faces , giggling . A boy smashes a disposable lighter to the sidewalk , where it explodes with a bang . &quot; Hey ! &quot; shouts 18-year-old John Buettgen , a wiry , goateed bouncer with serious eyes . &quot; You do that ? You ' re not coming_back in ! A piece of shrapnel from that could go_in someone ' s eye. &quot; The offender slinks back to the curb , snickering , and Buettgen sums_up the Vampyre ' s appeal : It is the only cheap , &quot; cool &quot; hangout in town . &quot; For anybody between the ages of 14 and 18 , there ' s nothing to do , &quot; Buettgen says . &quot; First of all , the majority of them don ' t have jobs . . . . Most of the jobs out there for people under 18 are , like , flipping burgers . Second , there aren ' t that many places at night for them to go to. &quot; * The Vampyre teen-agers pride themselves on being mostly sober and self-governing . ' We ' re off the streets , we ' re not doing major crimes , &quot; huffs Bree Lindberg , 15 , a Simi Valley High sophomore . &quot; At school if you dress strange like this , people stare at you . You come here and you get accepted for being weird. &quot; Everybody else , they say , is off playing pool or bowling or -- uncoolest of all -- yelling their lungs out at a football game and getting wasted at post-game parties . But the games draw huge numbers of Ventura County teen-agers on autumn Friday nights , and many fans never miss a game . One such night , cheerleaders chant and fans scream as Ventura High stomps Santa Barbara Dons in the second quarter . &quot; Stick ' em , baby ! &quot; a fan bellows at the teams . &quot; Let ' s go , Duane , let ' s stick these pansies ! &quot; Leaning_back on their elbows , three 15-year-old Ventura High_School sophomores scope out their boys in black . &quot; There ' s some pretty rad guys on this team , and you can quote me , &quot; says Sandra Link with a grin . &quot; Eric Olsen ' s really rad , he ' s the quarterback , &quot; offers Melissa Hall . &quot; We ' ve got a lot of hotties on our team. &quot; &quot; One of them likes my very good friend Sarah , &quot; confides Nicole Little . &quot; I ' m waiting for him to notice me. &quot; The Ventura Cougars muscle the ball downfield on a strong running_play , and the home crowd erupts in cheers , but the girls keep kibitzing . Senior Rita Dunn says she hangs_out at the football games because &quot; Ventura sucks . There ' s nothing better to do here . &quot; But then I ' ve lived here all my life , so I ' m burnt_out , &quot; adds Rita , 17 , gobbling a chicken_sandwich . &quot; You can ' t go anywhere because there ' s this gang that goes everywhere and ruins everything . They come and start fights and steal things and vandalize -- but other_than that , the people in Ventura are all really nice. &quot; Many Ventura County teen-agers structure their weekend nights to avoid gangs . Some retreat to brightly lighted , adult-run refuges such_as the Colonia Gym and the Thousand Oaks Teen Center . Playing 21 on the Teen Center ' s basketball_court , two boys taunt a buddy with a lesson about fat from a despised biology teacher , shouting &quot; Lipid ! Lipid ! Lipid ! &quot; as they charge in_for a layup . Three younger boys shoot pool and argue about rap_music while MTV blares from the stereo big-screen TV in the corner . A dozen more debate the powers of demons and wizards , losing themselves in the arcane fantasy_world of a sword-and-sorcery card_game called Magic : The Gathering . And hundreds find peace in the malls . Drive-by shootings and gang violence make Saticoy ' s streets &quot; too crazy &quot; to hang_out on at night , says Junior Burciaga , 14 , and older_boys shoo him away . On Halloween &quot; the big guys told us to go_home , man , &quot; he says . &quot; They told us to go_home because we ' d get blasted. &quot; Sure enough , the three heard gunshots later that night , he said . So , Junior and his Buena High schoolmates , Miguel Lopez , 15 , and Joel Ramirez , 14 , cruise the Esplanade mall in Oxnard , checking out clothes and hoping to snag phone_numbers from girls they meet . They are also , he admits a little sheepishly , killing time until they can get a ride home from Junior ' s sister . She walks by , but they ignore her coolly and lope off to flip through the latest rap CDs . Four other teen-agers pore over a jeweler ' s gems , passing time before hitting the theater . * They reminisce about raves -- late-night , drug-free underground parties they have attended in warehouses and hastily rented fraternal organization halls . And they grouse about their parents ' lectures on Oxnard ' s curfew law -- no one under 18 is allowed on the streets without purpose between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. . &quot; Tonight , they ' d only let me go_out because they know who ' s taking me , &quot; says Tina Perlingos , 16 , of Port Hueneme . &quot; My mother ' s like , ' Call me at 6 , call me at 7 , call me at 8 and let me know where you ' re going. ' &quot; She adds wistfully , &quot; If we were old enough , we ' d go_to The Dome , it ' s this club near Hollywood . I ' m going_to be 17 . I ' d love to be a year older. &quot; Still , it has been a fun -- if expensive -- night out . They will end it watching a long-awaited show of &quot; Interview With the Vampire. &quot; And they began it by lurking in the fake fog , eerie light and throbbing techno music of a new sci-fi battle parlor in Oxnard , sniping at each other with laser rifles . &quot; Lazerstar ' s probably going_to be the new trend , &quot; Jausch Galloway , 17 , says about his new-found obsession . &quot; Lazerstar is it . If you talk to anyone who hangs_out at Golf N ' Stuff , they ' re losers. &quot; Losers or not , teen-agers pack the Ventura amusement center_on Friday nights . Amateur golfers goof their way around Golf N ' Stuff ' s tiny plastic putting greens , shooting dimpled balls past windmills and other absurd obstacles . Amateur drivers in sputtering go-carts tear through the chicanes and switchbacks of a miniature Indy speedway . They bounce their fiberglass cars off walls and each other , laughing giddily in the November chill . &quot; It ' s fun , it ' s a safe place to go , and there ' s no violence or drug activity , &quot; said Tricia O ' Neill , 16 , a Buena High junior , straightening her hair after a wild , 17-m.p.h. race in a seat three inches above the track . * Classmate Colin Gallagher , 16 , stabs a finger at two drivers who jammed him into the wall_in the last race , and swears revenge : &quot; Those two guys , I ' m going_to GET ' EM ! &quot; Out on the sidewalk , a girl pouts to a friend about a lover ' s spat : &quot; So he ' s all , ' Well give it to me , ' and I ' m all , ' You think you ' re such hot crap ! ' &quot; Inside , Buena High ' s Nate Saylor , 17 , and Alex Dennis , 18 , slug it out at the controls of Primal Rage , each trying to kill the other ' s video alter_ego -- a snarling prehistoric giant . Nate ' s monster stomps Alex ' s into the turf , then battles the game computer ' s monster with hammerlike fists and greenish clouds of toxic flatulence . &quot; Strike a pose , Nate , strike a pose ! &quot; Alex urges . Alex ' s girlfriend Jennifer Hutton , 17 , hugs him close . Later , Alex and Jennifer lean together against a vacant pinball_machine , nuzzling amid the video room ' s electronic thunder and the smell of snack_bar fries . Up at Grant Park , parked cars line the road with more serious nuzzling going on behind their steamed windows . Misti Guilford , 17 , and Jay Badaracco , 18 , of Ojai , pull_up in his pickup_truck . Oil_rig lights glow offshore . &quot; There ' s nothing to do_in Ojai , &quot; says Misti . &quot; Usually we go_to football games , but tonight we went_to a car show at Hudson ' s Grill. &quot; Some come_to drink beer or smoke marijuana while gazing out over all_of Ventura and the Santa Barbara Channel . But Misti and Jay have come_with a blanket in the truck , they admit candidly , to make_out . Nearby , a Honda stops and two girls get_out . One stumbles over to a stone_wall and vomits . Without a word , they hop back in and drive_away . * Bryan Gross , 17 , and John Redding , 15 , pull_up from Santa Paula and park their white pickup facing Ventura Avenue . They ease onto the hood , light cigarettes and stare_down at the glittering field of street lights stretching away into the dark Ojai Valley . &quot; There ' s nothing to do , &quot; Bryan says quietly after awhile . &quot; Nothing to do except for cruising around. &quot; Indeed , there is little to do_in smaller cities such_as Fillmore and Santa Paula other_than hang_out at fast-food joints or house_parties , said Fillmore High guidance counselor Joe Torres . &quot; We hear a lot about partying , drinking and use of drugs , &quot; Torres said . &quot; We do have a lot of kids who just don ' t have access to cars , and they just stay around town . . . doing with what they have in front of them . And lots of times it ' s booze. &quot; Those who can muster the gas money drive into Ventura or Oxnard to the malls , the all-ages clubs -- anywhere they can get_out of the house and hang_out with their friends for a_few hours , he said . &quot; The main things kids want , &quot; said therapist Carol Walker , &quot; is to be with their peers , and to be liked by their peers . And they ' re also looking_to figure_out , ' Who am I ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
