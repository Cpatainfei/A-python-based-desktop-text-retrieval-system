   <HEADLINE> IN-LINE SKATING ' S HOT -- BUT IS IT SAFE ? ; RECREATION : THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN INJURED . BUT DO THE NUMBERS ALONE MEAN THE SPORT IS DANGEROUS ? THE VERDICT ISN ' T IN YET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In-line skating may reach its zenith this summer , according to sporting goods manufacturers , who predict sales of skates will surpass last year ' s record of $ 243 million . But will this also be the summer in which skaters are lined_up in hospital emergency_rooms ? The national Consumer Products Safety Commission says yes . Proponents and others say no . In a report released June 9 , the government organization reported that injuries from in-line skating had doubled in the first five months of ' 94 compared to the same period last year . With long , sunny days ahead , the commission warned , the rate of injuries is expected to soar . &quot; This sport is dangerous , and the injuries are serious , &quot; said Ann Brown , commission chairwoman . &quot; The CPSC wants your summer Rollerblading fun to be outdoors and in the sun , not indoors and in the hospital. &quot; The report predicted that potentially devastating head injuries will increase from 2 # 000 last year to 7 # 000 this year . But while Brown called the sport &quot; intrinsically dangerous , &quot; others strongly reject the idea that in-line skating is any more dangerous than other recreational sports . In a different government study also released this month , roller-skating injuries that required emergency_room treatment were found to be triple that of in-line skating injuries . Skateboarding injuries , too , were slightly more common than in-line skating injuries . From July 1 , 1992 , to June 30 , 1993 , injuries among roller skaters numbered 92 # 963 , compared to 34 # 938 for skateboarders and 30 # 863 among in-line skaters , reported Dr. Richard A . Schieber of the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta . The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . So , are you risking bodily harm if you take_up in-line skating ? The answer is not nearly as clear-cut as either recent report might imply , say most experts familiar_with the statistics . In-line skates feature a single row of wheels that , like ice_skates , require some balance and ankle strength but give the skater greater maneuverability than roller_skates . The sport is also unique for the speeds that can be generated ; the typical cruise speed is 10 to 17 m.p.h. , Schieber said . Moreover , the skater must learn to use a heel brake , as opposed to a toe brake on roller_skates . Because of these characteristics , some people worry that in-line skaters will be more likely to fall or collide_with other moving objects , leading to serious injuries , particularly to the head and wrist . According to some experts , in-line skating may_not be intrinsically dangerous , as the Consumer Products report stated , if the skater is well-trained and equipped with protective gear . On the other hand , merely producing fewer injuries doesn ' t make in-line skating any safer than roller_skating , Schieber said . The CDC study , he pointed_out , does not give the rate of injury -- that is , what percentage of skaters in each of the three roller sports are injured per outing . &quot; We don ' t know how many participants there are for each sport and how many times a week or month each person skates . Without knowing the injury rates , we really don ' t have a good handle on comparing which of these sports is safer , &quot; said Schieber , a pediatrician and epidemiologist . Moreover , the risks of in-line skating will not be easy to estimate until several other developments unfold , such_as : * The number of skaters stabilizes with fewer new skaters coming_on the scene . * Manufacturers produce improved safety gear , now under development . * Studies are completed analyzing how and where injuries occur . &quot; This sport only started around 1980 , &quot; in the United States , Schieber noted . &quot; It has achieved an enormous range of popularity in different age_groups in a short amount of time. &quot; * To Henry Zuver , the executive_director of the International In-Line Skating Assn. , the injury numbers are small compared to the number of people skating . Although there are no formal studies on this -- as Schieber pointed_out -- Zuver estimates that about 12.6 million Americans participated in in-line skating in 1993 . That would put the injury rate at a fraction of 1 % -- even if injuries more_than doubled_over last year . &quot; More_than 99 % are enjoying the activity and skating in a safe manner , &quot; Zuver said . Zuver and others think injury warnings have been blown_out of proportion because of how fast the sport has grown . Based on sales figures , participation is thought to have increased by about 500 % since 1989 . The Consumer Products Safety Commission ' s report is unnecessarily alarmist , agreed Dr. Gary Brazina , an orthopedic surgeon at Century City Hospital and team physician for the L.A. Blades professional roller hockey_team &quot; You can certainly expect injuries to increase because the popularity of the sport is growing exponentially , &quot; he said . The number of novice skaters may contribute to a temporarily high injury rate this year , he added . &quot; More and more people are doing_it as first-timers . There are a lot of beginners out there who don ' t know how to go_over a rough surface or who don ' t take a safety lesson or who don ' t wear protective gear , &quot; he said . If consumers followed the IISA recommendations for safe skating , the injury rate would decrease , Zuver said . The organization recommends that skaters wear protective gear that includes a helmet , wrist guards , and elbow and knee_pads . Schieber ' s study showed that wrist injuries are the most common among in-line skaters , accounting_for 38 % of all injuries . Several types of wrist guards are available , but it ' s not known how many skaters wear them or how useful they are in preventing bone fractures . * In addition to protective gear , first-time skaters should take a lesson before zooming off on_their_own , experts say . &quot; The skates aren ' t dangerous ; the lack of knowledge of the people putting them on is dangerous , &quot; Zuver said . Classes and workshops are becoming more common as the IISA trains more instructors , he said . The association has accredited about 50 new instructors in Southern California this year . &quot; Both ( government ) reports emphasize that taking a class is the right thing to do , &quot; Zuver said . &quot; It ' s not unlike skiing . If people go_to a ski slope for the first time , most will take a lesson and learn the proper methods to ski prior to even going_on a bunny hill. &quot; Veteran skaters make the sport look easier than it is , Brazina said . &quot; It ' s somewhat more difficult than regular roller_skating because of the way you stop , &quot; he said , noting that in-line skaters use a heel brake instead of a toe brake . &quot; Once you master that technique , it ' s pretty straightforward. &quot; Another hotly debated subject concerning safety is where in-line skaters should skate . Classes for in-line skaters should include basics on courtesy and protocol on sidewalks and bike paths , Brazina said . &quot; I think there should be some consideration for where you Rollerblade . There is always a conflict between cyclists and Rollerbladers , &quot; he said . Repeated calls to ban in-line skating on public_property and limit it to special fields or rinks have been raised locally since 1991 , when a 13-year-old Hermosa Beach boy died when he skated down a steep street and collided_with a bus . &quot; I think confining it to a certain place is over-administrating it , &quot; Brazina said . &quot; But , as a new sport , people have to be made aware of the rules of the road : where to skate and how to skate in traffic. &quot; In-line skating is a good aerobic_exercise , is easy on the joints and helps tone the major muscles of the lower body . But the next generation of research should help determine just how safe it is , Schieber said . Zuver is confident that in-line skating will prove to be no more risky than any activity in which man straps on wheels . &quot; Done in the proper manner , this is a good activity . I think future studies will bear that out. &quot; Tips for Safe In-Line Skating * Always wear protective equipment : helmet , elbow and knee_pads , and wrist guards . ( The protective gear can cost $ 50 or more ) . * Learn how to use the skates through lessons or classes . Instructions should include how to stop , turn and control speed . * Do not skate at night . * Do not skate in traffic . * Skate on smooth surfaces . Avoid slick or dirty areas , such_as sandy or oily spots . * Don ' t wear headphones or anything that obstructs hearing or vision . Source : Consumer Products Safety Commission</TEXT>
