   <HEADLINE> SANTA ' S SOLDIERS ; SALVATION_ARMY , SPONSORS SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Modesta Martinez has a Christmas_tree in her home , which brightens life a bit for the four grandchildren she is struggling to raise following their abandonment by their mother . * But with her husband ' s meager income , Martinez couldn ' t afford Christmas_presents for the children , who are all under the age of 6 , and the area under the tree remained bare . All that changed Monday when the Salvation_Army , operating from a temporary Christmas center at a city maintenance yard in Santa Ana , loaded Martinez ' s pickup_truck with wrapped Christmas_gifts donated through the organization ' s Adopt-a-Family program . &quot; It will be a beautiful Christmas , &quot; said Anaheim resident Martinez as Salvation_Army volunteers placed three shiny bicycles in the truck_bed , along with several large boxes wrapped in bright Christmas paper . &quot; The children will have happy faces , that ' s for sure. &quot; The Salvation_Army , which began charity operations in Orange County more_than 100 years ago , expects to give food baskets and gifts to 10 # 000 county families this Christmas , which is the most ever . &quot; The need goes_up every year , &quot; said Dolores Barrett , who heads social_services for the Salvation_Army in the county . &quot; And as we become better organized , more sponsors come forward. &quot; Throughout the day Monday , about 200 families trekked to the Salvation_Army ' s headquarters here . Mostly single mothers with_children , they received Christmas help ranging from cereal and canned goods to sweaters and Barney dolls . Each family was screened beforehand and asked to fill_out a Christmas &quot; wish list &quot; of food and gifts family members needed . Then those lists were given to sponsoring companies , individuals and families who donated the needed items . &quot; It ' s just me and my kids , and I ' m out_of_work so it ' s hard for me to buy anything for them , &quot; said Anaheim resident Yolanda Raines , 22 , as volunteers filled the back of a friend ' s car with toys and food for her and her three children . The children , ranging_in age from 3 years to 8 months , perked_up when they saw the Play-Doh , Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Sesame Street characters they got_to take_home with them . &quot; I ' m happy that the Salvation_Army could help us this year , &quot; Raines said . Throughout the week , needy families that are not part of the Adopt-a-Family program will also visit the Salvation_Army Christmas center for holiday assistance . Each family will receive a ham or a turkey and trimmings for a complete Christmas meal . Any child 14 or under will also receive an unwrapped gift . As with the Adopt-a-Family program , all recipients have already registered and will arrive_at set times to pick_up their holiday baskets . &quot; I just hope they think someone thinks they ' re special , &quot; said Barrett , standing in front of a warehouse full of games , in-line skates , stuffed animals and dolls that will be handed_out by the end of the week . &quot; Someone out there cares. &quot;</TEXT>
