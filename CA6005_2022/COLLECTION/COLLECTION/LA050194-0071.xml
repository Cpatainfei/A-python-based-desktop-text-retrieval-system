   <TEXT> I desperately fought the urge to write this letter after David Gritten ' s story on &quot; BackBeat &quot; and Stuart Sutcliffe ( &quot; John , Paul , George , Ringo . . . and Stu , &quot; April 10 ) . I was doing fairly well until the onslaught of reviews and related stories -- including a fashion blurb in_View ( April 15 ) -- but enough is enough . Once and for all , Astrid Kirchherr did not create the Beatles ' hairstyle or look . The man more truly responsible was Jurgen Vollmer , a fellow art_student . Countless interviews with Paul McCartney and John Lennon attest to the fact that Jurgen cut their hair in his hotel_room in Paris in late 1961 and shared his style of dress with them . One only has to view the pages of Jurgen ' s book &quot; Rock ' n ' Roll Times &quot; ( Overlook Press , 1983 ) or his cover photo of Lennon ' s &quot; Rock ' n ' Roll &quot; to see his involvement . I had the opportunity to work with Jurgen when I was the boom operator on &quot; Universal Soldier , &quot; as he was that movie ' s still photographer . We talked for many weeks about the events depicted in &quot; BackBeat. &quot; Lennon ' s introduction from Jurgen ' s book sums things up reasonably well : &quot; Jurgen Vollmer was the first photographer to capture the beauty and the spirit of the Beatles . We tried very hard to find someone with his touch after we returned from Hamburg , Germany . . . nobody could. &quot; T . ( HUCK ) CATON Seal Beach * Dear God , will the revisions of history never stop ? Pretty soon we will be informed that Stuart Sutcliffe provided the inspiration for the Kinks . After all , Stu was given_the_eye by a transvestite in Hamburg , and they wrote &quot; Lola. &quot; Coincidence ? I think not ! And what about Billy Preston , the other &quot; fifth Beatle &quot; ? What a minute -- my first_name is Stuart too . Maybe I influenced the Beatles ! Oh , man , I feel a really bad headache coming_on . STUART McCAMMON Orange</TEXT>
