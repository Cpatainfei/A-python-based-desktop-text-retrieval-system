   <TEXT> In the 1976 Oscar race , the buzz focused_on what appeared to be the two leading contenders for best motion_picture , &quot; Network &quot; and &quot; All the President ' s Men. &quot; But the Oscar went_to &quot; Rocky. &quot; In 1981 , the talk was high on &quot; Reds &quot; and &quot; On Golden Pond. &quot; But the Oscar went_to &quot; Chariots of Fire. &quot; These are the kinds of tales that keep Academy Awards shows quirky and surprising . They are what keeps anyone , with any sense of history , from saying that any anticipated award is a &quot; sure thing. &quot; They are also what keeps hopes alive for the four best picture nominees in a year that seems dominated by the fifth nominee , &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; &quot; I keep hearing that ' Chariots of Fire ' music , &quot; said an optimistic Harvey Weinstein , co-chairman of Miramax Films , the distributor of the best picture-nominated &quot; The Piano. &quot; Also in contention are &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; and &quot; The Remains of the Day. &quot; In particular , however , it has been a campaign on behalf of &quot; The Piano &quot; that has drawn the most attention because it has been the most aggressive . The Miramax people learned how to put_on a campaign when they brought the unlikely &quot; The Crying Game &quot; into Oscar prominence a year ago . Weinstein knows that &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is the film most people consider the odds-on favorite to win . It has all_the historic precedents going_for it and director Steven Spielberg won the Directors Guild of America prize , which , in the history of the movie awards , is tantamount_to winning the Oscar . But Weinstein contends there is no sure thing . &quot; Look , you have to keep it interesting . No one wants to be told by the media that the whole_thing is wrapped_up , &quot; he said . And , of course , short of winning the Oscar , Miramax also clearly hopes to help boost ticket sales as well as its prestige with the cerebral art-house film . So he and his partner , brother Robert Weinstein , have engineered an amazing -- and some say amazingly overblown -- ad_campaign in the Hollywood trade newspapers , the mailing of an elegant booklet on the movie printed on expensive parchment and some heavy advertising in_general . Full-page ads that boast the achievement of women in the making of &quot; The Piano &quot; have numbered as_many as seven per day in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter . They are congratulatory in tone , with director Jane Campion , for instance , singing the praises of the film ' s Oscar-nominated star , Holly Hunter . The sheer volume of the ads , especially for such a modest and relatively inexpensive film , has raised eyebrows , even among some veteran Oscar observers . * For his part , Weinstein claims the cost of the campaign is $ 250 # 000 . &quot; Our ads are black_and_white . They don ' t cost as much. &quot; On the other hand , he noted that ads for Universal Picture ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and that studio ' s other best picture nominee , &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; used color and cost more . But off the record , some individuals involved with placing Oscar advertising say that Weinstein is understating the cost . One estimate for the cost of the ads runs as high as $ 750 # 000 . &quot; It cost almost as much as the movie did to make , &quot; was the sarcastic comment of one . &quot; I ' m glad the campaign has been so effective that it seems like we ' re spending more_than we did , &quot; was Weinstein ' s reaction . &quot; I ' ll bet we spent 50 % of what the other studios spent. &quot; One of the more unusual aspects of &quot; The Piano &quot; campaign has been the emphasis on the achievements of women . The film has garnered nominations for women in seven categories . Among those is a best director nomination for Campion , only the second woman ever to be nominated for best director . The first was Lina Wertmuller for 1976 ' s &quot; Seven Beauties. &quot; &quot; It ' s clearly a women ' s achievement , &quot; Weinstein said . But taking that advertising line with the academy , whose membership is only about 15 % to 20 % female , is risky , he believes . &quot; Basically , we ' re just trying to say , hey , we ' re here . That the race isn ' t over. &quot; Weinstein ' s contention that the race isn ' t over was , in part , supported by a theory put forth recently by Hollywood Reporter columnist Martin Grove . It was Grove ' s thinking that in years when there are two strong films , it paves the way for a third film to win . But Grove ' s theory would n ' t necessarily warm Weinstein ' s heart : &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is the strong film in terms of Oscar votes , and &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; is gaining in support , Grove said . But Grove ' s thinking is that this rivalry might even pave the way for &quot; The Fugitive &quot; to win . Only a plurality of votes is needed in the five-way race and no one but the accountants working for the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences ever knows the tallies . This year the Oscar ballots are_due at the accountants on Tuesday . Producer Irwin Winkler , who with former partner Robert Chartoff , has been_on both the winning side ( &quot; Rocky &quot; ) and the &quot; sure thing &quot; side that loses ( &quot; The Right Stuff &quot; ) , knows full well the unpredictability of the academy . &quot; The night that ' The Right Stuff ' was up for best picture , we won four Oscars in a row ( for other categories ) . So I thought we ' re gonna win. &quot; But the winner for 1983 turned_out to be &quot; Terms of Endearment. &quot; &quot; I really didn ' t think ' Rocky , ' with a story about a fighter who was a million-to-one shot , would win . But it did , &quot; Winkler said . &quot; Very often the academy votes with their heart . They loved that theme of ' Rocky , ' that if you believe_in your heart , you can win. &quot;</TEXT>
