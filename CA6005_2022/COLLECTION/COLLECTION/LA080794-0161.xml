   <HEADLINE> ALASKA BEAR CENSUS ALTERED TO ACCOMMODATE CULTURAL DIVERSITY ; CONSERVATION : NATIVES ' OBJECTIONS FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO SCALE BACK THE STUDY AND LOOK FOR WAYS TO ALLEVIATE THEIR CONCERNS . THEY DEMAND THAT THE ANIMALS BE RESPECTED AND OPPOSE CONCEPT OF ' HARVESTING. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Native resistance to a government-funded brown_bear census in the Kwethluk Mountains has prompted officials to scale back while a consultant to villagers comes_up with other approaches . Disagreement over the study , overseen by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service , has renewed interest in &quot; cooperative management &quot; -- a hybrid technique that incorporates both science and natives ' observations . &quot; People are inventing a new system , &quot; said Charles Jonkel , a Montana-based biologist and an adviser to the Assn . of Village Council Presidents . &quot; Some mistakes are inevitable. &quot; The survey began last year after subsistence bear hunting rules were liberalized at the request of southwest Alaska natives . They objected to rules limiting subsistence hunters to one brown_bear apiece every four years . Federal managers in 1991 lengthened the subsistence season and increased each hunter ' s limit to one bear a year . But because there were no good estimates of the bears ' numbers -- and no forecasts on how increased hunting might alter the population -- liberalized rules were tied to the census . The study , scheduled to run_through 1999 , concentrates_on a 1 # 000-square-mile tract , a small patch of the 26-million-acre Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta refuge . Experts say 90 or so bears range over the study tract . Goals called_for 30 bears to be fitted with radio collars in 1993 , increasing to 45 bears in 1994 . But biologists who recently completed radio-collaring bears wound_up adding just nine more to the study after native Alaskans appealed_to various state and federal agencies , and Fish &amp; Wildlife managers in Washington ordered a reduced effort . &quot; Obviously we ' re disappointed , &quot; said Walt Stieglitz , regional Fish &amp; Wildlife Service director in Anchorage . &quot; The first choice of game managers is to know what the population level is and know what the trends are. &quot; Officials say rather than reduce the survey ' s impact , cutting_back on the number of bears collared this year could lengthen the census because it would take longer to collect valid data . Radio collars send round-the-clock signals so that a bear ' s travels and life_cycle can be monitored . Subsistence hunters killed 28 bears in the region last year and sports hunters took two , records show . Some villagers say liberalized hunts won ' t lead to more subsistence kills , since regulations have only legalized a routine practice without apparent declines in the number of bears . In Bethel , lawyer John Starkey said natives sought to change regulations that required hunters to deliver bear skulls to wildlife managers for tagging . Starkey said the native Yupik Eskimos believe that practice is disrespectful to bears . Villagers raised the same complaints over outfitting bears with radio collars . They also worried about eating meat from bears that had been tranquilized with the chemical that anesthetizes bears for the 30 minutes or so it takes_to attach a radio collar and complete other tasks to mark an animal for study . Game managers say the drug leaves a bear ' s system in 48 hours and cannot enter the food_chain . They say radio-tracking is a widely used technique that produces reliable data . But Stieglitz says that those worries show his service could have done a better job of explaining itself . For instance , eliciting support from native groups and adding their signatures to the study agreement would have been a step toward cooperative management , he said . The agreement is signed by the service and the state_Department of Fish and Game . Cooperation has worked for Fish &amp; Wildlife projects elsewhere , notably in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta goose management plan and in the Kilbuck caribou plan in southwest Alaska . Both are supported by native Alaskans . Dave Stearns , Fish &amp; Wildlife Service manager for the Yukon-Kuskowkim Delta refuge , said he was considering daylong briefings in the villages to explain how the agency planned to manage bears . Stieglitz said there ' s no deadline for suggestions from Jonkel , the natives ' consultant , although plans for next year will get under way soon . Alternatives to radio collars suggested so far include possible DNA tracking and use of cameras to count and track bears , as well as field trips with area residents . &quot; But to get a fix on a population , you have to know what ' s happening in the total sense , not just a portion of the population , &quot; Stieglitz said . &quot; There ' s no way you can do that running_around on the ground in a snow machine or ATV ( all terrain vehicle ) . that ' s not putting anyone down ; that ' s just a fact of life. &quot; Starkey , who represented the Village Council Presidents in an unsuccessful lawsuit to stop the bear census , said the survey is a hard_sell . Villagers have traditionally reserved bear hunting for an elite few ; the natives believe their hunting_grounds have been violated , he said . &quot; The common term you hear ( in game management ) is ' harvest ' -- the idea that people grow the animals and harvest them , &quot; Starkey said . &quot; But Yupiks believe animals present themselves to be captured . How you treat them will determine future success in hunting and the animals ' success in repopulating. &quot; Jonkel , who said he came_to Alaska in May to try to defuse hard feelings , said there ' s nothing technically wrong with the bear study . &quot; But if the local people don ' t want it , you have to look_for other ways , &quot; he said , including less intrusive studies such_as examining bear tracks or excrement . &quot; My job was getting people to slow_down and back_up and learn how to talk to one another , &quot; said Jonkel , who favors what he calls a &quot; sitting and whittling &quot; approach that would have authorities spend time getting_to know villagers before discussing touchy issues such_as access to game . Traditional wildlife management has been wed to the tables and charts of biologists , an approach that Jonkel said has best served the sport hunter . &quot; But now we ' re trying to add in the values of artists and poets and native peoples , &quot; Jonkel said . &quot; You ' re mixing hard data and hard science with cultural values and opinions and the observations of elders . The book hasn ' t been written yet on how to do that. &quot;</TEXT>
