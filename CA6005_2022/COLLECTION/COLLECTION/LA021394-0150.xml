   <TEXT> * All federal aid related to the earthquake should be loans , to be paid_back at market interest rates.The same goes_for aid related to floods , hurricanes , brush_fires , etc . It ' s completely predictable that , over a long period_of_time , all these disasters will happen . If people want to live_in an earthquake or flood zone , that ' s fine , but the rest of the country shouldn ' t have to subsidize their choice . TOM TULINSKY Los Angeles</TEXT>
