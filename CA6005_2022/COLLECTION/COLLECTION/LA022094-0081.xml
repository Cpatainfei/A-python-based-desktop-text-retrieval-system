   <HEADLINE> YOUR MORTGAGE ; ELECTRONIC CREDIT REPORTS STIR CONTROVERSY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of American home mortgage applicants could be denied loans erroneously in the coming months because lenders are switching rapidly to all-electronic credit-evaluation systems that rely heavily on raw , unverified and often inaccurate data supplied by national credit_bureaus . That controversial warning was brought_to Capitol_Hill in early February by representatives of a key segment of the credit industry itself -- independent , local credit reporting agencies who traditionally have prepared the cross-checked , verified reports used by lenders on mortgage loan applicants . In private meetings with congressional staff , the agencies charged that major lenders are now signing_up for so-called &quot; merged infile &quot; electronic reports , rather than performing traditional , time-consuming credit investigations . The merged reports are produced by tapping into data bases of two or three of the national commercial_credit repositories -- TRW , Equifax and TransUnion -- and then eliminating duplicate information electronically . The merged infile reports are attractive to lenders because they can be obtained quickly on almost any loan applicant -- often in just three to five minutes -- and at a far lower cost than traditional credit reports . Merged infile reports go_for $ 11 to $ 15 apiece . By contrast , the traditional approach -- the so-called &quot; residential mortgage credit report , &quot; generally costs $ 50 to $ 60 per applicant and takes 48 hours or more to complete . Borrowers ultimately pay_for the credit report , whichever approach is used . Despite the speed and apparent cost savings of all-electronic infile checks , according to Terry Clemans , vice_president of American Credit Connection Inc. , a Schaumburg , Ill.-based , credit-reporting agency , &quot; the results to the consumer can be catastrophic &quot; when the lender makes decisions on the basis of the computer data . Clemans cited preliminary results of a new study by the National Assn . of Independent Credit Reporting Agencies ( NAICRA ) that found that of a random_sample of 1 # 700 computer-merged infile credit reports for mortgage_applications , 16 % contained erroneous , derogatory information on the applicants -- ranging from false data on late charge-account payments to erroneous reports of bankruptcy filings by the home_buyer . Another 3 % of the merged infiles contained &quot; tradelines &quot; -- open credit_accounts -- that didn ' t even belong_to the borrower , and 2 % contained erroneous &quot; public filings &quot; like tax liens and court judgments against the applicant . Over 10 % of all_the merged infiles did not even contain all_the outstanding debts that the applicants themselves listed as part of the formal mortgage loan_application . &quot; The point , &quot; said Clemans in an interview , &quot; is that ( the raw data ) can ' t be trusted without follow-up verification . You need human involvement to be fair to the loan applicant. &quot; Clemans cited Federal Trade Commission statistics indicating that the No . 1 consumer complaint to the agency involves credit_bureau data -- 31 # 000 complaints filed_in the last four years alone . Obtaining merged infile data from the three repositories &quot; is where we ( local , independent credit-reporting agencies ) begin our work , &quot; said Clemans . Agencies such_as his routinely interview loan applicants to sort_out bad or conflicting data , and telephone employers , landlords and other creditors to double-check the raw information supplied by computer . Mortgage lenders contacted for comment on the NAICRA complaints on Capitol_Hill disputed the allegations . Ralph Mozilo , executive_vice_president of the largest mortgage originator in the United States , Pasadena-based Countrywide Credit Industries , confirmed that his company has moved away from use of the traditional mortgage credit report for all but a fraction of its applicants . Countrywide originated $ 49.5 billion of new loans in 1993 , of which about $ 43 billion utilized merged infile credit checks at application . The firm ' s experience with the new technique is diametrically at_odds with the NAICRA study . &quot; I can give you 10 ( traditional manual credit reports ) and 10 merged infiles and you ' re going to see the same information on every one , &quot; according to Mozilo . &quot; I would challenge anybody to show me differently. &quot; Countrywide uses electronic credit reporting early in the application stage as a way to screen , qualify and if necessary work with borrowers , said Mozilo . &quot; If we see problems , we can ask the applicant right on the spot . We have absolutely no interest in denying loans to good credit risks. &quot; Other major lenders echoed Mozilo ' s points , though most have not moved as dramatically to automated underwriting as Countrywide . So what does this simmering controversy boil_down to for you as a consumer ? First , the next time you apply for a home loan be aware of the strong switch to electronic credit evaluations -- and at least the allegation that unverified negative data could go uncorrected and cause a rejection . Second , if you find that your lender is indeed using quick , low-cost electronic reports , ask whether the savings of $ 40 to $ 50 or more are being passed_on to you . Some lenders reportedly are charging consumers the traditional $ 50 and $ 60 for credit checks that in reality now cost just $ 10 to $ 15 .</TEXT>
