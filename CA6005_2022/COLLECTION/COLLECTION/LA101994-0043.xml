   <TEXT> Prince Charles and Princess Diana have not agreed on a divorce or a financial settlement , their lawyers said Tuesday , denying a report that Diana will get $ 38.5 million when the couple divorce next year . A French weekly , Voici , reported the settlement , quoting from a new book , &quot; Diana : Her New Life , &quot; by Andrew Morton.The magazine quoted Diana as saying she &quot; felt_like the biggest prostitute in the world. &quot; Morton said that proofs of the book , due out Nov . 8 , appeared to have been stolen and that extracts printed in Voici were distorted . The leak from the new book followed revelations by Charles , 45 , in an authorized biography , &quot; The Prince of Wales , &quot; that he never loved his wife and was forced to marry her by his father , Prince Philip .</TEXT>
