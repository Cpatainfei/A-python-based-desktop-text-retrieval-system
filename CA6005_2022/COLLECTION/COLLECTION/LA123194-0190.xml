   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; SUPERVISORS CLASH OVER PLAN TO REVAMP COUNTY ; CRISIS : ROGER STANTON , IRKING HIS COLLEAGUES , GOES SOLO WITH A BLUEPRINT TO REMAKE GOVERNMENT AFTER BANKRUPTCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Orange County supervisors publicly sought to make_peace with angry labor_unions , they privately battled among themselves Friday over who would take the lead in revamping government in the wake of an unprecedented bankruptcy . Supervisor Roger R . Stanton was completing a &quot; white_paper &quot; on restructuring the county late in the day when colleagues accused him of acting behind their backs . &quot; It looks_to me like Roger is operating independently and perhaps has his own agenda , &quot; said a fuming Supervisor William G . Steiner , who was surprised to learn that the &quot; white_paper &quot; was being drafted without his contributions . Steiner said Stanton had previously asked him to co-author the work . Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez refused to comment but also appeared visibly upset upon learning of Stanton ' s solo effort . The infighting marked the first visible rift among the county ' s incumbent supervisors , who have sought to present a united front in trying to restore confidence in a county battered by the 4-week-old financial crisis . In outlining his &quot; white_paper &quot; to The Times , Stanton questioned whether County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider provided adequate oversight of the county ' s financial dealings . &quot; What did the CAO fail in doing ? &quot; Stanton said . &quot; What are his responsibilities of oversight ? &quot; Stanton said he plans to release the &quot; white_paper &quot; today . Earlier in the day , the board tried to soften the blow of what is expected to be hundreds of layoffs and forced early retirements . Supervisors promised those let_go because of the county ' s bankruptcy will receive a onetime cash payment for their sick_leave , vacation and other benefits . Supervisors also reversed their initial demand that county workers who choose to take early retirement by Jan . 10 sign waivers saying they will not sue if the county fails to pay their benefits over the next three years . Officials characterized both moves as good-faith efforts to deal with angry labor_leaders and the county ' s 18 # 000 workers . But spokesmen for county employees decried the concessions as meaningless and said they would move ahead next week with legal_action to halt widespread layoffs . &quot; It ' s like somebody who is trying to cut_off both of your arms then says , ' Wait a minute , I ' ll only cut_off one of your arms , ' &quot; said Paul Crost , a lawyer for the Orange County Attorneys Assn. , whose members include all deputy district_attorneys , public_defenders and lawyers in the county counsel ' s office . Charities Will Go_on In other developments : * Supervisors began meeting with consultants who are seeking to help the county out of bankruptcy . In separate sessions with Vasquez and Stanton , William O ' Connor -- a principal in a Newport Beach public finance firm -- suggested increasing various fees , such_as landfill dumping charges and utility taxes , to help restore the county ' s solvency . * In an emergency session called to discuss the impact of the county ' s bankruptcy , Catholic Charities of Orange County vowed to continue job placement and other programs despite concerns that the agency may_not be reimbursed for the services , whose funding is administered by the county . Those services include emergency food and housing for the needy , in-home care_for the elderly , gang prevention efforts and services to people with hearing_impairments . * The National Assn . of Counties established a &quot; county financial hot_line &quot; to respond to inquiries from counties regarding investments . A task_force also has been established to analyze the current state of county investments and the creation of a financial services center to assist counties in matters of public finance . * County leaders started working_on separate plans for dealing with the county ' s future . Vasquez , the board ' s new chairman , said he was studying whether to allow private companies to run county-owned parks , landfills and other facilities to raise money . Meanwhile , Stanton was completing his &quot; white_paper &quot; on restructuring county government . Stanton said his proposal starts &quot; with a basic examination of everything we do. &quot; The county has long neglected to trim fat or chop layers of bureaucracy , Stanton said , because the economy was good and there was an attitude of &quot; if it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it. &quot; &quot; Now it ' s broke , &quot; Stanton said . &quot; We don ' t want to patch_up the same ship and sail on. &quot; But Stanton ' s proposal seemed to rile other supervisors , including Steiner and Vasquez , who said they were not aware their colleague was putting_together a restructuring plan . &quot; Roger Stanton specifically asked me to join him in this restructuring effort , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; I ' m surprised at this -- what did he call it , white_paper or proposal -- because I was under the impression that I was to be joining Roger . . . . I ' m certainly interested in his ideas , but I don ' t think county government necessarily needs to be dismantled. &quot; Stanton said his paper proposes identifying county services that are essential and then looking_at each department to see if it should be merged , cut , restructured or left alone . He said the county has been a &quot; catch basin for every little project &quot; from communities and the county . Following accusations the county officials neglected to oversee Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron and the investments he made on their behalf , Stanton also said the county needs &quot; a clear delineation of authority and communication. &quot; The responsibility of county leaders needs to be re-examined , he said . Stanton specifically cited the administrative office run_by Schneider , with whom he has frequently -- though privately -- clashed . Schneider could not be reached for comment Friday night . Bracing for Cutbacks Across the county , frustrated city and school officials braced for more severe cutbacks . In Huntington Beach , the City_Council is set to make nearly $ 1 million in cuts Wednesday in an effort to close a budget shortfall that has been worsened by the county ' s financial crisis . &quot; We have to bite the bullet and see how to deal with it , &quot; said Councilman Ralph Bauer . In Irvine , school_board member Hank Adler said Friday that he expects the Irvine Unified School District to lay off workers . But he said he doubted the district would follow the county into bankruptcy . &quot; I think we can work our way through it , &quot; he said . &quot; I think ( bankruptcy ) is possible , but I think it ' s unlikely . I ' m going_to do everything I can to prevent that from happening. &quot; Irvine schools have the most of any Orange County school district -- $ 102 million -- in the county ' s now-frozen investment fund , which has lost $ 2.02 billion in value this year . Adler and other board_members said the district could avoid bankruptcy by selling some assets , such_as surplus property . But they said they would try to avoid selling parcels slated as school sites . &quot; We have some assets we can sell , &quot; Adler said . &quot; Obviously , there ' s a lot of steps you can take_in a $ 100-million organization. &quot; Other school districts said they would consider cutbacks next week . Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Supt . James O . Fleming is preparing a list of budget_cuts for the Board of Trustees to consider Jan . 10 . &quot; We put a hold_on a bunch of projects , &quot; after the county declared bankruptcy , said trustee Jerry Brakebill . Trustees of the Tustin Unified School District meet Friday to consider a second round of cuts . They also will consider whether to stop the construction of an elementary_school in Tustin Ranch because about $ 12.8 million of the district ' s money is now frozen in the county treasury . Two weeks ago , trustees approved more_than $ 1 million in cuts . At the Los Alamitos Unified School District , the financial crisis might force a delay in the reopening of long-anticipated reopening of Oak Middle_School . School_Board President Donna Artukovic said Friday that renovations to Oak Middle_School have been put_on hold , &quot; until we get a better feel of how much money we can get. &quot; Labor Actions Dismissed In Santa Ana , the Board of Supervisors , which announced a blueprint last week for broad cuts and layoffs , did an about-face Friday on its requirement that retirees sign a waiver that would have prohibited them from suing if they did not receive all payments due for accrued sick time , vacation and compensatory time during the next three years . Nonetheless , John H . Sawyer , general_manager of the Orange County Employees Assn. , called the board ' s decisions &quot; entirely self-serving &quot; and hardly_a concession . The lump-sum cash payment for laid-off workers already is called_for in_labor contracts that the board unilaterally voided , and the waiver demanded of retirees was blatantly wrong , said Sawyer , whose group representing 11 # 000 workers is the county ' s largest employee union . &quot; The board ' s action does nothing to restore the provisions of the labor_agreements rejected by the board last week , &quot; the association said in a statement Friday . &quot; The county is continuing to act in a unilateral manner , and it is not acceptable to us . Sawyer said there are more_than 2 # 000 county employees eligible to retire . But he charged that the county , by imposing a Jan . 10 deadline for retirement decisions , is trying to frighten employees into retiring early . &quot; That deadline alone is enticing people to retire early , &quot; Sawyer said . &quot; We think that the employees who want to retire early should be allowed to . But we definitely don ' t want the county talking people into retirement when they might be_better served working another year or five years. &quot; Sawyer , who initially estimated that 800 to 1 # 000 employees would lose their jobs as a result of the cutbacks announced last week , now says he does not expect such massive layoffs to take_place right away . On Thursday , eight people were laid_off from the county administrative office -- five part-time staffers and three interns . More layoffs are expected . Tom Uram , director of the county Health_Care Agency and a member of the three-person management council devising the county ' s budget_cuts , said the Board of Supervisors backed_off the waiver for retirees because of employee concerns that &quot; it looked_like a trick. &quot; Uram said removing the waiver would certainly help more workers make the decision to retire early . A letter detailing the removal of the waiver requirement will be sent to all eligible employees , he said . But Steiner downplayed the significance of Friday ' s action . &quot; For what it ' s worth , it softens the impact of the layoffs , &quot; he said . &quot; Secondly , employees who retire now maintain their legal_rights if the county doesn ' t have money in 1996-97. &quot; Steiner said meeting the county ' s obligations to those who retire &quot; should be our highest priority. &quot; Airport Sale Unlikely Under the bargaining agreement approved by supervisors last week , employees who retire before Jan . 10 would receive the balance of their sick and compensatory time and vacation in three payments over the next three years . The benefits of those who retire after Jan . 10 will be subject_to the bankruptcy process , which could cloud the payment picture . Friday ' s action by the board also clarified that all employees who are laid_off due_to budget_cuts will receive their compensatory time and vacation pay in one lump sum . Some employees had expressed concern that their money could be tied_up in the bankruptcy process , officials said . Uram said that the management council , which last week unveiled $ 40.2 million in budget reductions , had not received word of any additional layoffs as of Friday , but that department_heads have been encouraged to make those decisions and alert employees as soon as possible . Department_heads must give employees 14 days notice if their jobs are to be cut . Sawyer said the union is meeting with department_heads to talk_about ways to make budget_cuts without layoffs . Worker representatives are encouraging department_heads to check all contracts , eliminate overtime , initiate job sharing and be more liberal in granting leaves of absence . While supervisors still are weighing ways to privatize various government services , Vasquez and Steiner warned that there are obstacles to selling John Wayne Airport . Steiner said the airport still is subject_to $ 254 million in bonded debt that would have to be paid_off before any sale could be completed . Another $ 70 million in federal funds would have to be returned .
