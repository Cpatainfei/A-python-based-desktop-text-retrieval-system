Salenko ' s goal at the Pontiac Silverdome before 71 # 528 fans gave the Russians an unexpected early boost . Roger Ljung took_down Alexander Borodiuk in the penalty area . French referee Joel Quiniou awarded the penalty , which Salenko stroked almost casually into the net . The Swedes applied pressure to tie and Dahlin shook the Russian crossbar with a fierce drive . In the 39th minute , Sergei Gorlukovich was penalized for pulling Dahlin ' s shirt as the Swedish striker tried to reach the ball . Brolin drove the ball firmly into the net . In the 50th minute , the Russians lost Gorlukovich , who was ejected for his second yellow card of the game . With the one-man advantage , the Swedes created many chances before Dahlin ' s first goal . Jonas Thern swung a pass from the left_wing and Dahlin dived low to glance the ball into the net . The third goal was just as impressive , Kennet Andersson racing down the right and sending over a pass that Dahlin headed in with another lunge .</TEXT>
