   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; MOONLIGHT PATROL ; CAREERS : TWO MOVIE_INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS SPEND OFF-HOURS FIGHTING CRIME AS RESERVE DEPUTIES . IN SOME WAYS , THE JOBS AREN ' T ALL THAT DIFFERENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By day , Jeff Zacha and Rob Kenneally carry cellular_phones . In Burbank . At night , they carry guns . In the Southeast area of Los Angeles County . Every other weekend , these movie executives peel_off their business_suits for tan-and-green uniforms -- guns and badges in place -- and head out on patrol as Los Angeles County reserve sheriff ' s deputies . &quot; Whenever I ' ve taken a friend ( on ) a ride , &quot; says Kenneally , a Brentwood resident , &quot; they say , ' My God , you were having lunch with ( ABC President ) Ted Harbert today and now you ' re eating a Boys Burger in the ' hood in South-Central after responding to a homicide. ' &quot; Zacha , 39 , a supervisor of post-production for Disney , and Kenneally , 35 , executive_vice_president of Rysher Entertainment , met 11 years ago while training as reserves . They couldn ' t decide between law_enforcement and show_business , so they chose both . Working part time with the Sheriff ' s Department they patrol West Compton , East Rancho Dominguez , Walnut Park , the Florence-Firestone District , Willowbrook and Lynwood . When on patrol , they are miles away in distance and demeanor from their full-time professions . Westchester resident Zacha is the liaison between filmmakers and Disney studio executives . He reviews budgets , hires editors and oversees technical standards . Kenneally supervises production for several hours of programming , including &quot; Robocop &quot; and &quot; Lonesome Dove , &quot; and seven feature_films , including the upcoming Howard Stern movie , &quot; Private Parts. &quot; Going_on patrol , they said , provides a counterbalance to the Hollywood glitz . &quot; Given that we both work in a fantasy_world , it ' s an incredibly strong balance , &quot; Kenneally says . &quot; It ' s very therapeutic. &quot; Zacha agrees . &quot; It puts your problems into perspective. &quot; Both said they were attracted to law_enforcement as young_men . The interest has stayed with them . &quot; When I first started , &quot; Zacha says , &quot; it was a little strange , the dichotomy , the two different worlds . Now it gels into one. &quot; Zacha said film work and police duty both involve &quot; the ability to act calmly under a tremendous amount of pressure and to come_up with a way to resolve the problem . that ' s my job ( at Disney ) , and that ' s my job ( on patrol ) . &quot; Co-workers are impressed by their odd moonlighting . &quot; We always try and give_back to the community in some way , &quot; said David McCann , a Disney senior_vice_president and Zacha ' s boss . &quot; This is Jeff ' s way , and I think it ' s terrific. &quot; On occasion their two worlds have merged . When Kenneally was a Fox TV network executive in the 1988 , he helped develop the hit show &quot; COPS. &quot; &quot; I was one of the people who said we ought to do a cop show and put a video camera in the back seat &quot; of patrol_cars , he said . &quot; If people at_home had the same enthusiasm as ( civilan ride-alongs ) , I knew it would be successful. &quot; The duo are two of the Sheriff Department ' s 495 reserves in the Level I classification , the highest-trained part-time deputies , many of whom go_on patrol . They go_through most of the training of regular deputies and have the same authority as other sworn officers while on_duty . In Los Angeles County , there are 900 reserve deputies . The program attracts doctors , lawyers , computer_programmers and other professionals . Zacha and Kenneally may be the only movie executives who work Level I ; they are certainly the only ones who work_at the Century police_station , said Lt . Gil Jurado , the second-in-command . Century station ranks No . 1 per capita out of 21 Sheriff ' s Department stations in serious crimes such_as murder , rape and robbery , Jurado said . That made_it even more attractive for Zacha and Kenneally . &quot; I really wanted to know what it was to be a cop , &quot; Kenneally says . &quot; The promise of Firestone-Lynwood was you would be involved in felony arrests and see police work as a real policeman would. &quot; Their wives support their weekend work , though they worry about them getting hurt . Zacha ' s wife of 16 months rode along with him one night before they married to better understand what he does . &quot; She thinks it ' s great , &quot; he said . &quot; She ' s very confident of my abilities. &quot; Kenneally ' s wife is less enthusiastic . &quot; When she married me , she knew this came_along with the territory . If she could , she would rather I didn ' t do_it , &quot; said Kenneally , who has a 6-month-old daughter . In the past , the two have been in several dangerous situations in which they had to use their guns , though neither has shot anybody or been shot . In several instances , for example , suspects at the end of vehicle pursuits have fired on them , Zacha said . A recent Friday night proved relatively calm for this area . Still , they experienced everything from the tragic to the lighthearted during the shift . Early in the evening , driving along Laurel Avenue between 94th and 95th streets , Zacha asks a group of men and women playing_cards , &quot; Is everything all_right ? &quot; With a laugh , a woman responds : &quot; Tell Johnny , happy birthday. &quot; With that , Zacha turns_on the lights . Kenneally shouts , &quot; Happy birthday ! &quot; to one of the card_players through the car ' s loudspeaker . When the deputies drive_off , everyone smiles . But the mood changes quickly as they pass a maze of metal fences surrounding a housing project . They both look_around carefully . &quot; There ' s a lot of crime here and a lot of dope here , &quot; Zacha says . &quot; Nobody here is going_to help the police , &quot; Kenneally says . Built like a linebacker , the 6-foot , 2-inch Zacha can flick off his nice-guy smile and zap on a laser-like stare in a flash . Kenneally , an athletic 6-footer capable of intimidation when the need arises , projects a more genial persona . Kenneally says the two &quot; work as one . We ' ve both got good gut instincts , knowing if something ' s wrong in a situation . Nine out of 10 times , we ' re right. &quot; &quot; We ' re best_friends , &quot; Zacha says . &quot; We both know what our next move is going_to be . that ' s important when it comes_to officer safety. &quot; Reserves are not assigned to units . Rather , they choose their own station . And Century is not for everyone . Jurado , the second-in-command at the station , says a reserve deputy must be &quot; somebody who is self-confident , who understands there is a lot of violence in this area. &quot; Jurado says both men are outstanding cops . &quot; To go_ahead and accept another profession to the degree they have is phenomenal . . . . The full-time guys respect their skills and have confidence in their abilities , which is no easy feat in an area like this. &quot; * As the sun sets and night creeps_in , they spot an old Monte Carlo on Compton Avenue driving erratically . They stop the car . The teen-age driver has no driver ' s license or registration . He says the car belongs_to a relative . &quot; If I catch you driving this car later tonight , I ' m going_to arrest you , &quot; Zacha says , pointing him in the direction of home after ensuring the car hasn ' t been stolen . The deputies say that because the area has so_much serious crime they can ' t afford to spend several hours arresting and booking everyone without a driver ' s license . Unfortunately , the teen-agers know this , so they save money by not registering their cars . On 64th Street , they spot a teen-ager urinating outside a boarded-up eyesore with an old couch in front . The deputies call the teen-ager and two of his friends to the car . They wear baggy T-shirts , baggy pants and baseball_caps turned backward . The deputies warn them not to create any disturbances . There have been several drive-by_shootings on the street lately and the deputies are trying to break_up gatherings to avoid the possibility of innocent bystanders getting injured . &quot; I ' m claiming this street tonight , &quot; Zacha says . &quot; I ' m coming back. &quot; Satisfied that the youths understand them , Kenneally and Zacha drive_off . They pass a junky lot with old , rusted-out cars . A &quot; Code 3 &quot; -- high alert -- crackles over the radio . The deputies flick on the lights and siren . They speed to the 8800 block of Fir Avenue in the Firestone district to investigate a hit-and-run . Once there , they discover to their horror that this is as bad as it gets . A young_girl , about 5 or 6 years old , lies_in the middle of the street , the victim of an accident involving a dark-colored Camaro or Firebird that smacked into her and kept going . Several Sheriff ' s Department squad_cars are_on the scene . As flashes of red and blue lights from the cars illuminate the scene , a resident huddles over the child . He tries to comfort her by staunching the blood from cuts on the child ' s head . As Zacha and Kenneally help to disperse the crowd , paramedics arrive . Within seconds , six are attending_to the child . In the background , Kenneally and Zacha are comforting the child ' s grandmother , whose cries of grief pierce the night . The scene lasts only a_few minutes . The paramedics quickly load the child onto a stretcher , wheel her into the ambulance and head for the hospital . When they are finished assisting the other deputies and clearing the scene , Zacha and Kenneally head_off . A helicopter hovers overhead , helping in the search for the vehicle . &quot; I ' d love to nail this guy , &quot; Kenneally says . * Later that night , the deputies stop for a quick bite at the Boys Burger stand on Compton Avenue . Between bites of a monster-size hamburger , Kenneally explains what brings him to this part of town , at this time of night . &quot; There ' s a camaraderie here , which is not always the case in Hollywood , &quot; Kenneally says . He adds that there is another difference : &quot; In this business , you can spot the criminals. &quot; Zacha says police work has helped his film work . &quot; My fellow employees admire me for taking the time to do something that most people don ' t even want to know about . Most people spend their lives staying_away_from crime-ridden areas. &quot; Though they ' ve seen the worst , that doesn ' t stop them from seeing the best . &quot; There ' s a lot of great people here , &quot; Zacha says . &quot; Some of the nicest people I ' ve met are from the inner city. &quot; Back on patrol , they hand_out a ticket to a woman who sped through a red_light , break_up a potential disturbance back on 64th Street and counsel a group of gang members on going straight . But nothing happens that is as serious as the hit-and-run . Before checking out around midnight , they learn the young_girl has died . &quot; When I get home , &quot; says Kenneally , &quot; I ' m going_to hug my little_girl a little bit tighter. &quot;</TEXT>
