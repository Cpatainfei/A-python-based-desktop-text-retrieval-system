   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE ; CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN RECORDER ' S OFFICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A number of official reviews of Orange County Recorder Lee Branch ' s office over the years have raised serious questions about the way he managed . The concern has grown in recent months , and now the Board of Supervisors is poised to censure him . Branch has not been charged with or convicted of any official wrong-doing , and he denies that he has done anything wrong . But clearly he has lost both the confidence of_his_own employees and that of a broad cross_section of county leaders who have investigated his stewardship . It is therefore apparent that he cannot continue in office with any reasonable expectation of effectiveness . He should resign for the good of the county and for the good of his staff . Complaints from judges and various reports since the 1980s , two that came_in last week , all point to serious concerns about his management . The county ' s affirmative_action officer , who investigated employee complaints , concluded this month that Branch should leave . In the other recent report , focusing_on management deficiencies , a review found that the recorder had become isolated and unresponsive . Employees told investigators in both reports that they are demoralized . The report compiled by the affirmative_action officer found that at least nine employees sought medical or psychological treatment for stress and depression . In an office that deals with the vital records of an individual ' s life -- birth and death certificates , the deed to a house -- workers have enough stress meeting the public ' s expectations . A major source of the latest complaint in the affirmative_action inquiry about Branch has been his involvement with a woman who worked for him , a relationship both acknowledged . Subordinates said she &quot; wielded tremendous power &quot; and used it to &quot; intimidate &quot; others . Both Branch and his assistant deny that . But many companies bar one person in a relationship from supervising the other . And these recent concerns are but one example of a lengthy record of concerns about management . In 1984 , when Branch held the combined post of recorder and county clerk , state appellate_court judges in Santa Ana issued more_than a dozen orders threatening to hold Branch in contempt for not forwarding long-overdue files from Superior_Court trials . More deficiencies were found in a management audit the next year . In subsequent years , county supervisors denied Branch pay raises to get him to reform . There have been recent complaints of sexual_harassment and physical abuse , which he denies ; last year they led the supervisors to put him on paid leave for several weeks . As a result of the inquiries by the affirmative_action officer and a specialist in employee relations , the supervisors have been urged by the county administrative officer to take_control over the office . If Branch resists stepping aside , there is little the county can do . A seldom-used law lets the grand_jury recommend the district_attorney file civil misconduct charges , but that requires a full-fledged trial . That would not start until long after June , when Branch is up for reelection . He makes $ 75 # 000 a year , and county officials estimate he could get nearly $ 60 # 000 a year in retirement . The best advice for Branch is in those numbers ; he should take the money and go .</TEXT>
