   <HEADLINE> ART EXHIBIT ; AN INVITING LOOK_AT PRE-COLUMBIAN CREATIVITY ; PRESENTATION AT SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM INCLUDES FASCINATING EXAMPLES OF WORKS FROM COLLECTIONS OF SEVERAL MUSEUMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exotic , pagan unfathomable . If you are anything like me , these are words you would use to describe the objects that constitute a pre-Columbian art exhibit . Add exceedingly erudite text and descriptions and you have the all-too-typical and oh-so-forgettable museum experience that many of us have come_to expect . Then again , as fascinated as we Westerners are with distant and ancient cultures , we don ' t necessarily want our exotica served_up too familiarly . It would lose its appeal . The current exhibit at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art , &quot; Sacred Gifts : Pre-Columbian Art and Creativity , &quot; which runs until March 12 , has struck a proper balance . It doesn ' t bludgeon the average person over the head . It makes museum-goers work a little to gain an appreciation of the select meso-American , Central_American and Andean objects in the exhibit . There are no simulated tomb excavations , replete with ornate grave goods and a soundtrack of distant macaws and howler_monkeys , but the exhibition does educate in a user-friendly sort of way . This is largely due_to the persistence and scholarship of exhibit curator Jeanette Favrot Peterson . Peterson is a professor of art history at UC Santa Barbara , specializing in the ancient American civilizations . She organized the diverse array of objects -- from bizarre clay figures with oversized heads to black-stone masks and feather headdresses -- according to the materials they were made from . This simple format for Santa Barbara ' s first pre-Columbian show is the key to its success . Ranging from polychrome pottery , textiles , and objects made of stone , precious_metals , shell and feathers , the artifacts on display demonstrate the variety of materials used in the Americas before the Spanish conquest . Peterson sees the exhibit as an opportunity to reach beyond the classroom and expose the general public to pre-Columbian art and the distinct cultures that produced it . &quot; I have grown weary of scholarship that has become excessively esoteric and of academicians who can only be understood by those who speak the same language , &quot; she said . Her goal is to demystify the ancient cultures of the Americas by stressing the strong unifying elements that existed among the different groups represented in the exhibit . Pre-Columbian people held a &quot; fundamental belief in the sacred landscape , &quot; said Peterson said . The gods , ancestors and spirits who controlled natural cycles and the earth ' s fecundity were thought to be receptive to the offerings and ceremonies through which humans petitioned their generosity . Works_of_art often signified elite status and , when used in ritual , were thought to enhance their owner ' s influence in the supernatural realm . Peterson is widely regarded , by students and colleagues alike , as an exceptional scholar and teacher . Much scholarly and scientific investigation was required to determine the authenticity and provenance , where possible , of each piece considered for the exhibit . Museum curators and private collectors worldwide are re-sorting their storeroom shelves and displays to separate the cunning forgeries from genuine pre-Columbian artifacts . This is why Peterson began her selection of artifacts for the current exhibition in the museum ' s basement . With an eye well-trained in the design elements of pre-Columbian cultures , Peterson culled_out aberrant pieces -- those that did not conform_to the design qualities , spatial_relations and iconography within the various canons of pre-Columbian art . &quot; All objects have stories to tell , largely through a visual and pictorial language , &quot; Peterson said . Anthropologists and art_historians study the visual information provided by pre-Columbian works_of_art for clues vital to reconstructing a more complete picture of the society to which they belong . Working with chief curator Robert Henning and six UCSB graduate_students over several months , Peterson determined that only 20 of the nearly 100 objects represented in the museum ' s permanent pre-Columbian collection were suitable for &quot; Sacred Gifts. &quot; In the end , an assortment of objects spanning a period from 3 # 000 B.C. to the time of European contact in the 16th Century , were assembled from eight museums including the UC Santa Barbara ' s University Museum , UCLA ' s Fowler Museum of Cultural History , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Mexican Museum in San Francisco . Graduate_students who helped organize &quot; Sacred Gifts &quot; benefited from working with experts and original materials while they developed their research topics and documentation . But in the end , it will probably be visitors who will get the most out of Santa Barbara ' s debut exhibit of pre-Columbian art and its accompanying written materials .
