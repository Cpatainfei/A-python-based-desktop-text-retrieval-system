   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : CENTRAL : CHINATOWN ; RESIDENTS INSPECT RAIL WALKWAY PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After meeting with the community for five months , an architectural firm is close to completing designs for a walkway to the planned light-rail station on Alameda and College streets , officials said . &quot; The community expressed the need ( for ) a landmark , a gateway &quot; at the station , said Helena Lin Jubany , an architect and owner of Jubany-Mutlow Architecture . The Downtown company was hired by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in March to conduct a $ 71 # 000 study on various methods of connecting the 28-foot elevated station to Chinatown . That stop will be one of 14 the Pasadena Blue Line will make when it opens sometime after 1998 , MTA officials said . The $ 841-million project , which received only $ 123 million in construction funds this fiscal_year , covers a 13.6-mile stretch that will also serve Pasadena , South Pasadena , Highland Park and Downtown . Although no funding has been secured for a pedestrian connection to the Chinatown station , MTA officials and Chinatown community activists hope detailed plans for a walkway will make_it easier to solicit financial_support from the state or federal_government or private developers . The connection could also boost the appeal of a historic community that over the years has lost clientele to the San Gabriel Valley , residents and business_leaders said . &quot; This alone is not going_to revitalize Chinatown , but I think it ' s going_to be pointed in the right direction , &quot; said David Wayne Louie , vice_president of the Chinatown Economic Development Council , who was among more_than 100 people who attended an Aug . 4 community meeting with the architect . &quot; It ' s going_to embrace and not inhibit the community. &quot; During the meeting at Chinatown ' s Cathay Manor , representatives from Jubany-Mutlow presented 10 concept drawings and focused_on an elaborate walkway that would include a lower- and upper-level plaza design . The audience of mainly senior_citizens evaluated a model of the 375-foot ramp that would stretch from the station to North Broadway . From the station , Blue Line passengers would be able to take an elevator to the lower plaza or remain on the upper plaza , where they can walk to a small park or shop_at the stores along the ramp . Next to the walkway would be a three-story , 300-space parking structure . And a second pedestrian connection could be built diagonally from the upper plaza to a building on North Broadway , which could be developed as a senior_citizens housing complex , Jubany-Mutlow officials said . Residents also addressed the need for a public information booth manned by a bilingual speaker , restrooms and security patrols . MTA officials want to hold another community meeting later this month or early next to discuss all_the suggestions since March and present more detailed drawings of the upper and lower plazas .
