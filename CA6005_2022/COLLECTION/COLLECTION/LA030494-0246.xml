   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS ; DID FED PLAY ITS HOLE_CARD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trying to explain the extraordinary upheaval in global financial markets over the past month , some Wall Streeters are posing an intriguing question : Were world stock and bond markets riding atop a dangerous speculative bubble before this -- and did the Federal_Reserve_Board understand this and vote to willfully prick that bubble ? On the surface , the Fed ' s decision to boost short-term interest_rates by a quarter-point on Feb . 4 , the first such credit tightening in five years , was a function of the U.S. economy ' s robust growth . The Fed wanted to preempt the rising inflation that often follows economic booms . But at_the_same_time , the central_bank was obviously aware of the unprecedented flow of dollars plowing into foreign stocks and bonds over the past six months , driving share prices up 50 % to 100 % and bond yields way down . Much of that money , from both professional &quot; hedge_funds &quot; run_by heavily leveraged global traders and from mutual_funds flush with dollars from average Americans , was increasingly being targeted at extremely high-risk emerging markets , from Southeast_Asia to Latin_America to Africa . Moreover , the Fed and other global central bankers have been quite vocal about their concern over the mushrooming use of often-shadowy derivative securities worldwide . Derivatives , which include options , futures and a host of related &quot; synthetic &quot; securities , allow traders to make bets_on stocks and bonds with little money down , or to hedge themselves against market declines and thus maintain bigger positions in_stocks and bonds than they otherwise might . If Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan wanted to send a signal that would prompt big investors to tone_down their level of speculation in red-hot markets around the world , including in the United States , nothing would be more effective than a move to tighten credit . Higher U.S. interest_rates , after all , immediately boost the cost of leverage -- the billions in borrowed bank dollars used by hedge_funds and others to magnify their market bets . At the same time , higher U.S. rates would be expected to stem at least some of the tremendous dollar flow to overseas markets , by making U.S. money_market instruments and bonds more attractive . If the Fed were concerned about keeping the U.S. economy ' s recovery on track , one key would be to avoid sudden artificial shortages , including shortages of capital . Did the Fed believe a bubble was forming in financial markets ? Greenspan hasn ' t said so publicly , but perhaps he didn ' t have to . &quot; Everybody knows we ' ve been pushing the envelope with valuations &quot; in bond markets around the world , says Christopher Baker , whose C.P. Baker &amp; Co . in Boston manages a small hedge_fund . The Federal_Reserve &quot; was aware that people were drunk with this stuff. &quot; Indeed , while the hedge_funds have been blamed for sparking the dramatic selloffs in bond and stock_markets since the Fed ' s rate hike , many other investors -- including many mutual_funds -- in retrospect had made far larger bets than they should have_on long-term bonds . Just last fall , investors snapped_up 100-year fixed-rate bonds from companies such_as Walt Disney . The logic of being willing to accept a relatively low , fixed interest_rate for the next 100 years , with all_the unquantifiable economic risks in the interim , escaped many pros . But some investors were so willing to believe the story that inflation was dead , and that long-term interest_rates would continue to decline from what were already 20-year lows last fall , that the greater risk seemed to be in not buying bonds with the rest of the crowd . At the same time , betting_on further interest_rate declines in the recession-wracked economies of Europe and Japan appeared to make perfect sense . In their defense , investors who loaded_up on bonds can say that they did so fully expecting that the Fed would raise short-term interest_rates eventually . In theory , by taking a preemptive strike against inflation , the Fed should have helped bring long-term yields down further , not push them up . that ' s because long-term yields are supposed to respond to inflation expectations , not to the relative level of short-term rates . * It hasn ' t worked_out that way , of course -- at least not so far . The yield on 30-year Treasury_bonds has surged from a low of 5.79 % last fall to 6.83 % now as investors have bailed_out . In Europe , bond yields have risen more_than three-quarters of a point just since year ' s end , also amid wild selling . Interest_rates also have skyrocketed in emerging economies , even though there has been no change in the improving fundamentals of many of those economies . Ashwin Vasan , a portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Management in New York , calculates that Argentine fixed-rate bonds now yield 5.3 percentage_points more_than long-term U.S. bonds , compared to about 3 percentage_points more a month ago . And formerly red-hot global stock_markets have tumbled as bond yields have jumped . Hong Kong ' s Hang Seng stock index has plunged from 12 # 599.23 early this year to 9 # 802.03 now , a drop of 22 % . In the United States , the Dow industrials have slid nearly 4 % , virtually all_of that drop occurring since the Fed ' s move Feb . 4 . In effect , even if the Fed didn ' t want to prick the global markets bubble , it now has , and perhaps with more dislocation in the world ' s financial system than the central_bank , or anyone else , might have expected . It ' s not helping , either , that America and Japan are waltzing toward a trade war , further chilling the mood of some investors . &quot; I think they ( the Fed ) wanted to slow_down the speculation , &quot; says David Hale , economist at Kemper Securities in Chicago . &quot; But I don ' t think they wanted to see a 1-percentage-point rise in long-term interest rates. &quot; Which raises a disturbing question : With the bubble burst , and investors of all stripes suddenly looking_for reasons to sell , has the Fed set_off a chain_reaction of market declines worldwide that will go much farther than logic would dictate ? Two aspects of the stock and bond markets turmoil give some veterans pause today : * First , one of the selling points for international diversification over the past year was that world markets generally don ' t correlate -- that is , Americans should invest overseas because those markets often rise when the U.S. market falls . So far this year , virtually all stock and bond markets on the globe are slumping in value . That could cause individual investors to reconsider the wisdom of sending so_much money overseas , the hot trend since last summer . * Second , a major reason U.S. bond yields continue to rise is simply because the majority of investors have succumbed to the &quot; deer-in-the-headlights &quot; syndrome -- they ' re so stunned by what has occurred in such a short time , they ' re afraid to step_up and buy , for fear of being buried under another avalanche of bond dumping by hedge_funds and other desperate sellers . Rates can ' t rise forever , of course . Some bond pros now say foreign bonds in particular are screaming buys . But in the mammoth U.S. bond market , there is no sign yet that enough investors are willing to bet that the process of wringing_out speculation has fully run its course .

Trying Times on Wall_Street The current tailspin in the world ' s stock and bond markets -- triggered in part by the Federal_Reserve ' s raising of short-term interest_rates on Feb . 4 -- has drawn attention to key policy_makers , market players and trading strategies that may have contributed to the down-spiral . KEY PLAYERS Alan Greenspan : The move by the U.S. Federal_Reserve chairman on Feb . 4 to raise the so-called federal funds rate is widely seen as signaling the end of a period of falling U.S. interest_rates and triggering the current market sell-offs . Banks and securities houses : Big &quot; money-center &quot; banks such_as Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan that had loaned money to hedge_funds also were trading on_their_own , and are said to have suffered huge losses . Big securities firms such_as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also have had huge trading positions . To cut their losses , these traders may have unloaded more of their securities , thus contributing to the downslide . Hedge_funds : These multibillion-dollar private investment groups made huge bets early this year that U.S. , Japanese and European bond yields would continue to drop and the Japanese yen would weaken against the dollar . But those bets have proved ill-timed , leading to billions of losses and heightening market volatility . Because they often borrow most of their money and invest in derivatives , such_as futures and options , the funds are highly leveraged and must sell huge amounts quickly to protect their positions . Big speculators : George Soros is perhaps the world ' s best known international market speculator and hedge_fund operator . His trading operation is said to have lost $ 600 million in recent weeks . But two years ago he reportedly made $ 2 billion betting against the_British pound . Michael Steinhardt , another prominent speculator , is said to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in recent weeks . WHAT TO WATCH Yields : Yields on U.S. Treasury securities have risen sharply since Feb . 4. , discouraging cuts_in foreign bond yields that hedge_funds had been betting_on . Further gains in yields could snuff_out the U.S. recovery and lead to further sell-offs in_stocks . Growth : If the economy continues to grow fast -- the 4th quarter of 1993 saw expansion at an 7.5 % rate and many analysts expect 3.6 % growth this year -- fear of inflation will obligate the Fed d to tighten further by increasing short-term interest_rates . That would lead to higher rates for some mortgages , bank CDs and other loans and investments . The markets respond best to slow , steady growth with minimal inflation .
