   <HEADLINE> MY BUBBES ; TESSIE IS 93 ; PEARLIE , 92 -- THE STRONGEST WOMEN I KNOW . THEY ' RE PIONEERS , AND ADVENTURERS , MATRIARCHS AND SHTARKERS . THEY ARE MY GURUS , MY PERSONAL GUIDES TO THE EXISTENTIAL DILEMMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Compared to my grandmothers , I ' m a shmegegge . that ' s shma-geggy , Yiddish for nerd or ineffectual slob . They , of course , would fiercely deny that their granddaughter is a nudnik . How could I be anything but brilliant and beautiful in their eyes ? Perfect , even . But the truth is that next to them , I am a regular shmo . Take gin_rummy , for instance . The last time I played Tessie , my father ' s mother , she killed me -- 98-0 . She knew she would . When I asked her to play , she replied , without malice : &quot; Why ? You vant to see how you can lose ? &quot; As for my mother ' s mother , Pearlie , her particular genius resides in a ball of yarn and a crochet_needle . You need a toilet-paper cover ? A doll with braids ? A place_mat ? An afghan ? A beret ? You name it , Pearl makes_it . She shouldn ' t , because of her arthritis . But sometimes , a yarn master can ' t help herself and sneaks_in a baby sweater for her great-granddaughter , packaged inside a knotted plastic bag . ( &quot; She ' s so beautiful , kineahora , &quot; Pearlie tells me , invoking one of her oft-chanted Yiddish expressions to ward away the evil_eye while pressing another crocheted goody into my hands for my 10-month-old daughter , Lucy . I am pathetic and bring Pearlie nothing . She waves her thin , veiny hand , as if to bat away my guilt , and says , &quot; It ' s nothink , dahlink. &quot; ) My grandmothers are the strongest women I know . True , their health is fading . But in my mind , they ' re pioneers and adventurers , brave and fearless . Shtarkers , to be precise , who live_by themselves . Tessie Weinreb in Queens , N.Y. , Pearlie Feldman in Santa Monica . They ' re also the first women I ' ve watched grow old , outliving , between them , 12 siblings , three husbands , one son and most of their friends . Pearlie is 92 ; Tessie is 93 . &quot; Maybe , &quot; Tessie says with a shrug , &quot; God forgot my address. &quot; Always with the jokes , they can get_on my nerves . They can even drive me crazy , with their Old_World superstitions and Neanderthal attitudes about a range of issues . Pfui ! And yet , they are my gurus . Just as striking as their longevity is the sense of utter constancy they offer in a world that seems to speed along faster and faster . Like it or not , they are my personal guides into old_age and the existential dilemma . &quot; You shrink , this you should know , &quot; Tessie advises . &quot; You shrivel_up , just like a potato , &quot; Pearlie agrees . Two matriarchs , they are my bubbes -- the Yiddish term for grandmothers , pronounced with the vowel_sound in bubbles , bub-ees . They are not in the least pretentious , nothing fancy-shmancy about them . And they offer no sugar-coated prescriptions for life : It is hard , it is complicated , it is not forever . There is joy in sorrow and sorrow in joy . Always , there is family . And passion . Even now , the titles of their favorite TV_shows speak volumes . Tessie ' s is &quot; The Young and the Restless. &quot; Pearlie ' s is &quot; Mad About You. &quot; The last of a breed , they are still close to their immigrant past , hardened by wars and the Depression and shaped by discrimination against Jews that began to dissipate only in the 1950s . Now they have little patience for basic questions . What is , is . Ask Tessie , for instance , why being an Orthodox Jew is so important to her , and she answers rhetorically : &quot; Why does an Arab wear the shmatte on his head ? &quot; Ask Pearl why she continues wearing her wedding_band , 17 years after her husband ' s death , and she quips : &quot; I ' m married forever to him . All my life . I ' m a Jewish nun. &quot; I should say , at this point , that I am utterly baffled at how middle_age has turned me into a sentimental sop . Pathologically so . I cry over stuff that is embarrassing -- my 10-year-old ' s Little_League game , my 7-year-old ' s musical-comedy debut , my baby girl ' s weaning . I am a boomer sandwich , eyeing my children ' s growth , my parents ' aging and my grandmothers ' frailty as signs of my own mortality . So I unearth the past to make future connections , keeping the continuum alive . I go_back to the Source . To Pearlie and Tessie . My grandmas . My heroes . My bubelehs . I first decided to interview my grandmothers when I realized that they were having a difficult time recuperating from falls they suffered in the summer of 1993 . Both had slipped and broken their arms . Pearlie ' s stumble was especially traumatic , since it occurred when she was two-stepping with her folk-dance troupe , the Dancing Dolls , during the rousing finale of &quot; Achy Breaky Heart. &quot; I phoned them both to say that I wanted to write an article about them . &quot; Oy vaysmere , &quot; Tessie complained right away , &quot; can ' t you get a better subject ? I can ' t see . I can ' t hear . I can ' t talk . What else ? &quot; Translation : She couldn ' t wait to see me . Pearlie was equally happy to comply . &quot; Joyala , my life is an open book . You just tell me when. &quot; In the following months , with tape_recorder in_hand , I periodically visited them and , on occasion , telephoned . When I stayed with Tessie , we were roommates , and her snoring drove me wild ; Pearlie and I stole time together over tea and bopkas . I found myself frantically jotting_down notes about the details of their lives , as if the act of remembering would allow me to hold_on to them longer . Then I resisted writing their stories with every journalistic bone in my body : How could I truthfully distill the lives I most wanted to extol ? At first glance , Tessie and Pearlie seem as different as two women could be . Tessie can be secretive and has few close friends , though she is acidly funny ; Pearlie , who tosses her head back and lets_go a piercing cackle when she laughs , is vocal and has a range of acquaintances and relationships . Pearlie is ribald , Tessie is circumspect . Tessie boycotted my wedding 17 years ago when I married my husband , Brock , who is not Jewish ; Pearlie not only came_to our wedding , just a month after her husband died , but she also joyously danced there , a la Isadora Duncan , in pink chiffon . Tessie strictly observes Jewish rituals , keeping kosher and attending shul as often as possible ; Pearlie , who prays by writing letters to her deceased son and husband , believes that religion resides in the heart . On closer inspection , though , it quickly becomes clear that my grandmothers face the same predicament : Both women , in a sense , have become invisible . As with the matriarchs of the Old_Testament , you have to read between the lines to understand them -- or just to find them . To be an old_woman in American culture is to be cast_off , dismissed as daft . Jewish mothers , in particular , have become cultural icons and the butt of countless jokes . Yet , these public portrayals mask a deeper truth that is no secret : Women outlive men . Thus , their undisputed power resides in their longevity , as keepers of the family legacy . Tessie and Pearlie stand as symbols that sometimes there are men around and sometimes not , but life goes_on pretty much the same either way . They tell stories about their past with the narrative panache of Isaac Bashevis Singer . Are their stories true ? Some go_back so far , to the middle of the 19th Century , that they surely improve in the retelling . But accuracy isn ' t the point , really . What matters_to me , anyway , is that I find the girl in the woman before me , still alive_with possibility . What follows is my ode to bubbe hood , a patchwork of interviews , recipes and kitchen-table advice : Pearlie ' s wisdom and Tessie ' s tsuris ( &quot; worries &quot; ) . &quot; You know what ' s tsuris ? &quot; Tessie asks , casting one of her deadpan looks . &quot; Two Jews were sitting on the train and they were talking tsuris . And the Irishman was holding onto the strap in the train . And he hears them talking tsuris , tsuris , tsuris . He says , ' For God ' s sake , if you have a sore ass , why don ' t you get_up and give me a seat ? ' &quot; Mother ' s Day , May 8 . 6:30 a.m. Inside Tessie ' s apartment . &quot; Come , mamashayna , &quot; she says as soon as she ' s hugged me hello . &quot; Come eat breakfast. &quot; Bleary-eyed , I ' ve just arrived on the red-eye from Los Angeles to her one-bedroom apartment in Queens . She lives_in a six-story brick building , the Winston , in a tree-lined , working-class neighborhood of Briarwood , not far from Forest Hills . In anticipation of my arrival , she ' s already beaten the eggs for my matzo brei -- scrambled eggs with moistened matzo . Wrapped in a plastic bag and covered with a paper_towel is her homemade marble_cake , my favorite . At 93 , Tessie stands just under five feet , though she once was a_couple_of inches taller . She wears thick , pink-framed glasses , red lipstick , a flowered housedress and sneakers . Her right_hand shakes , her fingers are gnarled from arthritis , her sciatica is a source of constant pain . Still , she manages to have her fingernails painted fire-engine red . &quot; It ' s good to live long , but it ' s not good to get old , &quot; she tells me . &quot; You can ' t do what you want. &quot; She sets a cup of coffee on the place_mat . &quot; Do you use sugar or you use your disposition ? &quot; Her apartment , decorated with family photographs from decades ago , is furnished neo- &quot; I Love Lucy , &quot; with most of the lamps , tables and chairs from the 1950s . But they ' ve held_up for a reason . &quot; This is what I learned from my husband Izzy , &quot; she says of the grandfather I never met and for whom I was given my Hebrew name . &quot; If you buy , buy good. &quot; In the living room , above an overstuffed couch , there hangs a pastoral oil_painting of Stevensville in the Catskills . On a side wall , there are two ceramic dancers in frames . Over her bed , too , there are framed prints of Degas dancers . It ' s drizzling out . I ask about her arthritis . &quot; They would n ' t let me alone. &quot; &quot; Who would n ' t let you alone ? &quot; &quot; The arthritis . They stick_to me . They like me. &quot; A jokenik , she deflects most questions with her highly idiosyncratic brand of humor . I offer her a Mother ' s Day gift -- a box of soaps . &quot; Why spend money on me ? &quot; she asks . &quot; Why not ? &quot; I ask . &quot; ' Cause I hope I use it up. &quot; Meaning she doesn ' t think she ' ll live so_long . &quot; I hope not , &quot; she says . &quot; You hope not ? &quot; &quot; Because me no like it , &quot; she says , invoking the upside-down syntax to a favorite old Yiddish musical , &quot; Oy , I Like She. &quot; To listen to someone you love tell you that she ' d prefer to be dead is dreadful . In my grandmother ' s case , though , it ' s predictable . She ' s been talking this way , without remorse or rancor , for the last several years , at least . But her depression is also understandable . Once stubbornly independent , she now must rely_on her two daughters , who structure their week around shopping for her and transporting her to the doctor or to the beauty_shop . She has an attendant five days a week to help_out . And she has an emergency button , plus the phone , her lifeline . &quot; I lost confidence in myself , &quot; she explains about her fall last year . &quot; I don ' t trust myself anywhere . I don ' t go_down for the mail myself . I do sometimes , but the cane -- I hate people should see me . So I don ' t go some places I want to go. &quot; She ventures out twice a week now , to her Golden Age Club on Mondays and to Danny ' s Specialty Beauty_Shop on Saturdays to have her white hair fluffed and sprayed into a bubble-like crown . &quot; Now , anything that I want to do , I can ' t do_it myself , &quot; she says . It takes her half an hour to fasten her bra , longer to clean a chicken . &quot; So what is it ? I don ' t want to aggravate the Man Upstairs , but it ' s no use . Why do they celebrate the Golden Age ? &quot; She reconsiders . &quot; Maybe I ' m too critical on myself , too , &quot; she adds . &quot; The kids say that I ' m too critical . Do you find me that way ? &quot; Not at the moment . She ' s just served me a giant slice of cake for breakfast . Who am I to complain ? Minutes later , though , I ' m fair_game . For this trip , I ' ve lugged along a breast pump so that I can continue to nurse my 10-month-old daughter when I return home . Tessie disapproves of the setup . &quot; If she could do the four days without you , you don ' t need it , &quot; she says of the pump . I disagree . &quot; All right , &quot; she shrugs , &quot; nurse until her wedding day. &quot; The blue door to Pearlie ' s apartment has a little plastic sign hanging from the doorknob , like the ones you leave_out for room service in a hotel . But Pearlie ' s sign is a daily reminder of what it ' s like to live_in the shadow of death : &quot; Good_Morning . I ' m OK ! &quot; Kathie Lee and Regis are blaring from the TV_set . Pearlie tells me she doesn ' t much care_for Kathy Lee ' s new haircut . We guffaw over Regis ' beady eyes . Pearl has high cheekbones , bright eyes and a pixie haircut , like Peter_Pan . I practically tower over her now , she ' s such a sliver of her former self . Though she moved to California 10 years ago , her voice is still coated in Brooklynese . &quot; You want orange_juice or what ? &quot; she asks . She lives five minutes away from me in the Silvercrest , a concrete apartment complex for seniors . Her building is sandwiched between a muffler shop and the Phoenix Bookstore , a hangout for hipsters . During the week , she usually eats her meals downstairs in the dining hall ; otherwise , she cooks for herself in her tiny kitchen , making nothing like the lavish spreads she is famous for in the family . But on the kitchen_table , there is an entire plate of chocolate chip cupcakes she baked fresh for my visit . She speaks in code sometimes , expecting me to fill_in the blanks of her sentences . She forgets words . Names slip her mind . She calls this &quot; the 92-year-old thing. &quot; I tell her that I ' ve got the same problem , but I ' m 51 years younger than she . She cackles . So do I . &quot; They ' re no-cholesterol cupcakes , &quot; she explains , sitting at the table , which is covered by one of her crocheted tablecloths . &quot; Did you make them from scratch ? &quot; &quot; Yeah. &quot; &quot; Really ? &quot; &quot; And there ' s no cholesterol. &quot; &quot; Where ' s the recipe from ? &quot; &quot; From the box. &quot; A cake_mix , in other words ? &quot; Yeah . And they come_out perfect . They ' re so easy . Yeah . Ya take ' em right out of the thing. &quot; The thing . She means the paper cupcake wrapper . Her usual sartorial splendor is much in_evidence . She wears a peach-and-white sweater with matching polyester pants and white Reeboks . She crocheted the sweater not long ago , and it has gold thread crocheted into the wool . Around her neck , she wears a gold charm that says &quot; Happy Birthday , &quot; a gift from her grandchildren for her 90th . &quot; You gotta enjoy your life , &quot; she tells me , worried that I ' m overextended . &quot; Don ' t rush , rush , rush . Learn to enjoy while you have your health. &quot; Though she ' s slowed_down recently , having stopped her volunteer work_at the local hospital and cut_out her weekly dancing with &quot; the Dolls &quot; for fear of another fall , Pearlie ' s great enthusiasm for life is undeterred by age . &quot; I think if you keep yourself involved in lots of things and don ' t concentrate_on yourself , it helps a lot , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s good to have outside interests , to keep the mind busy . It ' s like a sore in your heart to not be involved . &quot; Life is great , if we could only have it without pain , &quot; she says . &quot; What ' s bad with life ? There can be lots of fun in this world , lots of enjoyment -- air to breathe , food to eat , places to go . What do we know what we have in the other world ? Nothing. &quot; Her mind is razor sharp , especially when I ask about her past . She conjures_up vivid memories of having her tonsils extracted ( &quot; just yanked out with , like , pliers , but then I got_to get ice_cream with my father on the trolley &quot; ) , of asking advice from the local health department on how to take_care of her first baby because she wasn ' t sure if feeding him spinach at three months was advisable , of going_through menopause ( &quot; The doctor said to me , ' Just lie_down , put a cold compress to your head and chest , and relax. ' And I didn ' t have any problems : It didn ' t last too long , about two years &quot; ) . I survey her tiny apartment , decorated with recycled furniture from my parents ' house , including the vanity table from my bedroom when I was a girl . Over the peephole to her door , she ' s hung a macrame object and little purple pompoms . &quot; that ' s a shmtchek , shmtchkie -- a thing , &quot; she says , explaining this all-purpose Yiddishism ( pronounced shmitch-eck and shmitch-key ) as a whatchamacallit . &quot; If you want a hand , you say , ' Give me that shmtchkie . ' &quot; She smiles mischievously . &quot; Grandpa used to call this a shmtchkala , &quot; she says , pointing to her crotch . I ask her to please not turn this into an X-rated interview . &quot; Shmtchek can be any part of your body , &quot; she says . Clearly , she was mad about Moe , my lusty grandfather who ' d give me rides_on his feet and make his biceps dance to the strains of Russian folk_songs . She invokes his memory , his joie_de_vivre , whenever possible . When my younger sister recently reported how wonderful , kind and supportive her new husband is , Pearlie asked only one question , a la Moe : &quot; Is he a good lovah ? &quot; A BUBBE QUESTIONNAIRE Do you have any famous relatives or ancestors ? Tessie : None of them were in jail . To be famous ? I can ' t recall . Pearlie : No , except on Grandpa ' s side . His sister ' s daughter was married to a gentleman who was a senator . I forget his name . that ' s the only outstanding one . What is your favorite health , beauty or fitness tip ? Tessie : Beautiful I was never . I ' d rather go_for health than beauty . But I can ' t control my health anymore . I like to be clean , neat . Fancy ? No . Of course , I have my hair done and nails done every Saturday at Danny ' s . I ' d rather look decent . So people would n ' t say , &quot; That old_lady , she looks such a shlump ! &quot; As for health , I just ate some potatoes . Pearlie : When I look in the mirror , I ' m not happy to see the wrinkles . The skin changes so_much in your 90s . The whole face changes . I don ' t know how to stop it . I just don ' t want to get_to look any worse than I am now . ( Laughing. ) Because I don ' t want to look scary to my great-grandchildren -- and it ' s bound to happen . Your face becomes crepey . Your eyes become smaller . Your nose becomes longer . I put_on sunscreen when I go_out . Just a little powder and lipstick . I can ' t pluck my eyebrows because the skin gets red and sore . I do the best I can . I brush my hair and wash it . Otherwise , no secrets . I never was one to stay in the beauty_parlor . As long as I take a shower twice a day , keep myself clean . Not be a shtunk , smelly . The word that best describes you is : Tessie : Not a blabbermouth . My children say critical . It ' s easier to criticize than be correct . Pearlie : Love . Tell me the most unusual things about yourself or unusual things you have done . Tessie : I got_married again . Maybe I shouldn ' t have . I don ' t know . Pearlie : I like to tell dirty_jokes , a simple joke . It ' s nice to make people laugh . How do you like to celebrate your birthday ? Tessie : No wishes , no shmishes . that ' s all . I don ' t tell anybody it ' s my birthday . What ' s the difference ? Those years that come , I don ' t appreciate it . I can ' t do what I want . I don ' t enjoy with the old_age . To me , I ' m not that thrilled about it . I ' m living the longest of anybody in my family . So ? Pish posh . Pearlie : To be with the family . Oh yeah . Can you love your children too_much ? Tessie : There is no such thing to love_children too_much . No . It ' s not possible . Or is it ? Pearlie : When you give love , you give it with your whole being . I don ' t think I could love my children less , no matter what . Even my son-in-laws . My family is my life . * It is a beautiful , crisp morning in New York . By 10 , Tessie and I are still wearing our flannel pj ' s , with no intention of getting dressed . We ' ve already broken_into a box of chocolates I ' ve brought with me from L.A. She likes the chocolate-covered honeycomb . &quot; We ' re not eating , just noshing , &quot; she explains . A lifelong Democrat , she loves to talk politics and is presently castigating Paula Jones . &quot; Maybe she really instigated him , &quot; she says , referring to President Clinton . &quot; This she would n ' t tell you. &quot; We break_out the cards , and I &quot; wash &quot; or shuffle them . The cards fly , 10 to her , 10 to me . She turns_over a king of spades , double points . Her joints ache , her cough won ' t quit , her ankles swell . But over a game of cards , the physical ailments subside and her mind is as agile as ever . My grandmother always uses a deck of red Bicycle cards , the ones with two cherubs atop bicycles in opposing circles . The drawing makes me think_of Tessie as an angel , playing cards . The circle of life . It ' s a nice reverie , a confection that has nothing to do with reality . &quot; What kinds of meshugeneh ( &quot; crazy &quot; ) cards you gave me ? &quot; she asks , surveying her hand . If American_Indians listen to their elders around a campfire , I listen to my grandmother with cards fanned in my hands , a discard pile between us . It ' s our little ritual , practically sacred . For as long as I can remember , we ' ve related this way . First it was the game of war , then go_fish . Then , when my hands were big enough , gin . She used to let me win when I ' d stay with her while I was still in college , the two of us smoking cigarettes into the night . Now she ' s ruthless . I throw another card on the discard pile . &quot; See ? &quot; she chides me . &quot; You don ' t know how to play . You gave me the jack and the queen ! &quot; I tell her it ' s because I ' m kind . She throws another card that I pick_up . &quot; You take cards for tromba , &quot; she chides me again . &quot; You know what ' s tromba ? &quot; I shake my head . &quot; For speculation. &quot; My knowledge of Yiddish is extremely limited , but Tessie uses these card-playing sessions to offer lessons . Amazingly , she has no age spots on the back of her hands . This , she tells me , is because her family had an oil_business in Europe and her hands were constantly immersed in cottonseed_oil . Her job as a teen-ager was to teach the workers how to extract the oil . &quot; I was never young , &quot; she says of her childhood . &quot; I was never a child. &quot; Her father ran a brick and oil factory in what was then Austria , formerly Poland . Her mother never paid her a compliment . Raised &quot; to be nice , &quot; she was born Toby Teitel in the shtetl of Kozowa in Galicia , not far from the Russian border . Her education was cut_short when she was 13 because of World_War I , though she could speak six languages . A refugee for two years , she crossed the Carpathian Mountains by horse and wagon to Czechoslovakia with her family and returned home around 1917 , only to find that her Polish neighbors had taken her family ' s home apart , brick by brick . After contracting typhoid_fever and losing her hair , she supported her family by working the black_market , trading oil and kerosene for flour and tobacco . Anti-Semitism was endemic . Since her father had a long beard and was easily identifiable as a Jew , he risked his life every time he walked outdoors . She , on the other hand , could pass as a shiksa in bare feet and peasant skirts . Was she angry with her father for not protecting her ? &quot; The cannons were shooting over our heads , &quot; she remembers , &quot; and if anything had to be done , I could do_it . For me it was an adventure . An adventure to go , to do more_than my father does . My father once said , we were having an argument , he says , ' I like to argue with Toby. ' He knew I ' d answer him right . And he liked it . He ' d ask me my advice . He and I , we were really pals . Why should I be angry ? I protected him , so he shouldn ' t have to go outside. &quot; On Aug . 15 , 1920 , she and her parents came_to America by steerage . At Ellis Island , she had her first taste of white_bread and corn_flakes for breakfast and reluctantly agreed to change her name to Tessie at the urging of her sisters . Within a year , she met a dapper egg handler , Izzy Horowitz , a gentle man who didn ' t have much of a flair for business but adored the violin . Together they opened a mom-and-pop grocery_store in Brooklyn , called Clover Farms , and had three children . My father was the only boy . Tessie lived_up_to the meaning of her married name , Horowitz : &quot; works hard. &quot; Was she in_love with him ? &quot; Yes , but I knew that I can do_better than he . We were in business . . . . &quot; Her voice drifts_off , as if to suggest theirs was a marriage_of_convenience . What followed were years of the Depression , when they lost the store . While her husband worked as a grocery clerk , earning $ 20 a week in her brother ' s store , she raised money for the local hospital , the kosher one with two kitchens . During World_War_II , she sent her son off to war ; he returned from Japan , wanting to become a psychoanalyst . Her daughters became a bookkeeper and a schoolteacher . Not long after Izzy died in 1951 , she married a milkman , Sam Weinreb . For Tessie , it is a virtue to never reveal one ' s true feelings , especially sadness . When asked how she ' s dealt with her grief , she says , &quot; I never made any sour face to anybody . Nobody knew what ' s inside of me . They still don ' t. &quot; She catches herself , as if she ' s said too_much . &quot; I ' m talking now , &quot; she adds , &quot; but I shouldn ' t. &quot; &quot; Why not ? &quot; &quot; Pheh , &quot; she replies , waving her hand . It ' s 12:30 . She snaps on the TV . &quot; Shut up ! &quot; she ' s yelling at the TV_set . Her soap_opera , &quot; The Young and the Restless , &quot; is_on , and she ' s bored by one of the plot_lines . She likes to watch this show for the blind character who she claims has never blinked , a sign to Tessie of fine acting ability . But more , she ' s interested in the trial of a woman who ' s been charged with killing her husband . If she ' d had the opportunity , my grandmother tells me , she would have been a lawyer . Or better still , a writer . She ' s never admitted this girlhood fantasy to me before . With my pen and notebook in_hand , I search her milky gray eyes and feel my shoulders lighten . The flash of connection , a flesh-and-blood link of desire , spanning three generations . Not that she says any more . She doesn ' t need to . She sits in her recliner chair with the blue embroidered cloth draped over the headrest . &quot; Oh , here ' s the caca-mercial again , &quot; she complains . The phone rings . Bad news . My mother has learned she has breast_cancer . She ' s opted for a mastectomy . The phone rings again . It ' s Pearlie , her voice shaky , bordering_on hysterical . She asks_for my permission to call my mother , even though she ' s just spoken_to her . She ' s made the same call to my older sister . &quot; I don ' t want to be a bother to her , &quot; she tells me , saying she doesn ' t want my mother to worry that she ' s worrying . &quot; I hesitate 10 times before I call . I don ' t want to be a nudge . &quot; See , when your children are babies and you learn to protect them , no matter how old they are , they ' re always your children . They ' re still your babies . And that feeling never leaves . &quot; I know I ' m a pain_in_the_ass , &quot; she adds , her voice cracking . &quot; Please forgive me , Joyala . But she ' s my baby . My baby . Why can ' t it be me , not her ? &quot; When I hear my grandmother , fragile , frightened , nervous , wanting to help but knowing she can do nothing , I hear myself -- and I cannot bear to listen . In the weeks that follow , while my mother is recuperating from surgery , I speak_to Pearlie more often than usual . Normally , we talk on the phone weekly and see each other about twice a month -- for family gatherings , brunches , birthday_parties -- and invariably she ushers me home with another batch of French_toast for my kids . But now , we ' ve become allies in the worry department . My mother ' s cancer brings me closer to my grandmother , who tells me that her greatest wish in life is that her daughter be_well . For the time being , anyway , her wish has come true . In June , Pearlie , my mother , Lucy and I watch my middle child , Gus , perform in a little show at the Odyssey Theater -- a four-generation cheering section . Afterward , Pearlie hands me an envelope to deliver to him . In it , she ' s enclosed $ 15 in cash and a note telling Gus how much she loves him . The following week , she bequeaths her old typewriter to my kids , too . Always giving , always bearing hugs and kisses , even in print with her Xs and O ' s . And I wonder , how is it that someone who grew_up with so little can give so_much ? Born_on the Lower East_Side in 1902 , Pauline Rosenwasser hated her given name , so she changed it to Pearl . Her parents immigrated from Austria in 1894 . Her father pressed women ' s coats . Her mother opened a series of candy and dry goods stores in Brooklyn , often leaving her children unattended . While playing_on a fire_escape one day , Pearlie watched as a cousin fell three stories , suffering a minor concussion . She remembers her mother saying , guiltily , &quot; It should only have been one of my children , &quot; and later wondering if she had cursed her own family . Of seven children , three died young -- two baby boys and a 13-year-old girl , from a weak heart . By the time Pearl was 13 , she had to leave school to help support the family . Before she learned shorthand and worked as a stenographer , she sewed labels into coats for $ 5 a week . When she needed a winter coat , a family friend suggested she could get one wholesale from Morris Feldman , who worked_on Second Avenue and specialized in tucking and tailoring coats for heavyset women . &quot; When I first met him and he invited me up_to his shop , he took my measurements -- and he never tried anything , &quot; she remembers , dreamily . &quot; He was a total gentleman ! I always respected him so_much for that ! &quot; She fell_in_love instantly ; he was so handsome -- blue eyes and thick , wavy hair -- and he taught her how to tango . Her mother disapproved , since he was Russian-born , not American . Pearlie couldn ' t help herself ; they had three children , a son and two daughters -- a stockbroker , a schoolteacher and an artist . Not that everything was idyllic . She endured her husband ' s love for schnapps , cigars and horse_races and the shock of her son ' s death , at age 53 , from a heart_attack on a subway . At the funeral , Moe had no idea their son had died , since he had suffered a series of strokes . Three years later , after nursing him through a terminal illness , Pearlie moved West to be closer to her older daughter , my mother . Just how Pearlie managed to live this long is a question she ' s often asked , since she ' s outlived everyone at the Silvercrest . &quot; You got_to listen to your body , &quot; she says simply , &quot; like even if you get a corn , you soak your feet. &quot; There are some dietary concessions , including the no-cholesterol cupcakes . But truth be told , she ' s a big proponent of butter , of an occasional glass of wine and of gargling with Cepacol at the first sign of a sore_throat . And exercise is important : She walks to the Third Street Promenade daily , jogs in place in her apartment and takes an exercise class for her arthritis twice a week . &quot; I really think as long as you can move , you should keep_on moving , &quot; she says . &quot; Because when you sit , everything sits with you . When you hit 92 , especially , the body sort of lets you know , ' Ah , you ' re getting old , take_it_easy . We ' re tired_of taking_care of you , the bones. ' &quot; Most recently , she realized her taste buds had stopped working . But back to the longevity question . &quot; Oh , I think it ' s the family that makes me live this long , &quot; she says of her nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren . &quot; There ' s so_much enjoyment in this . I couldn ' t ask_for anything more . No money . No jewelry . No anything could compete with the wonderful family I have. &quot; I assure her she doesn ' t have to say this for my benefit . &quot; I say thank_you to God for letting me live this long . And anything He gives me over that , I thank him again twice . But I want to tell you something , &quot; she adds . &quot; If you ' re a good_person when you ' re young , you ' re a good_person when you ' re old . And if you ' re a nasty person when you ' re young , you ' re a nasty person when you ' re old . Character doesn ' t change . Age don ' t change character. &quot; What does Tessie think_of Pearlie and Pearlie of Tessie ? Tessie : I like her very much . I admire her very much . She is a different type than I am . I grew_up in Europe . She grew_up in America . I don ' t know which way is better or worse . Pearlie : Tessie ? She is a good_person , a very interesting woman . She has a different attitude about life . She is looking toward death . She thinks it would be a relief . I don ' t figure that . I want to last as long as I can . I want to be_on this Earth . She says it would be great if she died in her sleep . But life is so interesting , you know ? So_much change . You find it interesting enough to want to stay . The status of women in Judaism has always been problematic to me . Things are changing , of course , but not by much . It takes a lot to undo 5 # 000 years of put-downs . Just take_a_look at the Book of Leviticus and the childbirth purification ritual : A woman who bears a son is unclean for 40 days thereafter , whereas a woman who bears a daughter is unclean for 80 days . Exactly how this hideous little 40-day difference can possibly be accounted_for is unclear to me . Can anyone in_his_right_mind really believe that girl babies are somehow dirtier than boy babies ? Here ' s my grandmothers ' feeling about it : Gender shmender . Still , to explain the exalted-cum-pampered status of males in my own family , Tessie offers a story . &quot; My grandmother Toby , the one that I ' m named after , she had a daughter . Then she had a boy . The boy died young . She had another baby , a girl . Another baby , a boy , passed_away . The boys couldn ' t live and the girls lived . She already had three daughters and not even one son . And it bothered her . &quot; She became pregnant again . She had a dream that an old_man with a long gray beard came_to her , and he said , ' You know you ' re pregnant and you ' re going to have a boy . But name him after me . My name is Chaim . And he ' s going_to live. ' They had nobody in the family with that name , Chaim . You know , there was a Yousla , Moishe , but no name Chaim . And the baby was born a boy , and she named him Chaim , and he was the only son . That was my father . He was a spoiled brat . He took_advantage of his four sisters. &quot; Yet she idolized him completely . Hoping that Tessie and Pearlie would give voice to my own beliefs , I asked them the same leading question : Are you a feminist ? Tessie : Say it in plain English . Pearlie : What do you mean , a feminist ? Do you believe_in equal rights for women ? Pearlie : Definitely . Women need to work and be equal . But also , not to hoit yourself . It ' s hard to have a career and family . I love to see women get_ahead in the medical field and all_over . When we were younger , we didn ' t have that . We were treated like a pot on the stove . Really ! We had to do the dishes and clean the house , and the men got so_much more respect because they were supposed to be smarter than us . They had more education than us . Now , when I see these women doing things that men never even dreamed of doing , I think the coming world is great . We can expect much better and bigger things now . Tessie : Yes , that I would like . I would n ' t mind that at all . Politics interest me very much . If I ' d be much younger , I ' d run_for senator , and I ' d make the law even better for the women than the men . My mother and her mother were brought_up to just get_married and keep house and raise the children . When I grew_up , they had to educate the boys . The girls don ' t need anything because they can wash diapers without education and things like this . A woman should have the same rights as a man . I would n ' t let my husband go above me . If he drives , I drive , too . Just now , Pearlie is remembering her happiest moments as a child and confides they were stolen and secretive -- reading . &quot; My biggest pleasure was going_to the library , taking_home seven or eight books -- they ' d give you as much books as you wanted -- putting it under my cover in the bed , and after Mama would go_to_bed , I ' d turn_on the light and read for hours . I got more out of reading even than going_to the movies. &quot; Today , like the last few times I ' ve seen her , Pearlie ' s eyes are red-rimmed . At first , she says the pinkness is caused by her allergies , but later admits it ' s more often from crying . &quot; Living here , &quot; she says , &quot; most of the people that die -- and they die in their sleep -- everybody else says , ' Oh boy , if I could only die in my sleep , it would be wonderful. ' To be honest , everybody fears it . And they won ' t talk_about it , either . They just say , ' Oh well , I wish I could die like that. ' &quot; This is not the first time that Pearlie has spoken_to me about her fear of dying . On more days than she cares to recall , another apartment in her building stands empty because of the death of a friend or neighbor . More_than once , she has told me that she feels &quot; desolated. &quot; Just a week ago , her 95-year-old brother , Marty , died . Pearlie sits in her recliner chair from Sears , the one my mother and aunt bought for her last year . It almost looks thronelike , since she ' s covered it with one of her purple and orange afghans . She drifts_off for a moment as the car mechanic next door checks another muffler . &quot; It makes you feel sad , &quot; she continues , shutting her sliding glass door to mute the noise . &quot; Your family leaves you . It ' s like a tree grows , and the branches come_down , and the tree looks so lonesome and lonely . But I don ' t feel abandoned . I still feel attached. &quot; I call Tessie , worried about the headaches she has begun to mention to my father . She recently was scared by a dream , of her parents calling_out to her . Is her time near ? &quot; How ' s your head , Grandma ? &quot; I ask . &quot; What head ? &quot; she rifles back , deflecting my concern . She asks about my children , starting with my older son , Trevor , one of her 14 great-grandchildren . I report his latest accomplishment , placing second in a citywide math meet . As if to make_up for lost moments ( with my father , I wonder ? ) , she instructs me to tell him how wonderful he is . &quot; You should ! &quot; she insists . &quot; You should give him a compliment . When he deserves it . Don ' t be stingy ! I ' ll teach you psychology . Really . No , this is a fact. &quot; Then she adds , &quot; Tell Brock hello. &quot; She has almost forgiven him for not being Jewish . When she was last in California , he teased her about flying off with him to the Caribbean . It ' s a joke she can ' t resist . &quot; Tell him he ' s still my lover boy. &quot; She says her health won ' t allow her to make her annual pilgrimage to California . She jokes that maybe she ' ll be &quot; out of town , &quot; as in no longer alive . &quot; If I don ' t come next year , &quot; she quips , &quot; I ' ll come two years later. &quot; I ' ve put myself in an impossible position . Contrary to professional standards of journalism , I promised my grandmothers they could have prior approval of the details in this article . Family over business , as they ' d say . What did they think ? &quot; Praise the children more , &quot; Pearlie says of her daughters . &quot; They ' re the best . They don ' t come better . And you make Grandpa sound like a finagler and a gambler . You should portray him as a family_man . Family always came first for him . He was such a good man. &quot; There is one other little thing , Pearlie says , laughing . &quot; The Salvation_Army runs this building . Do you have to put_in the part about my , you know , crotch ? &quot; And Tessie ? &quot; It ' s OK , &quot; she told me , obviously holding_back . &quot; It ' s all_right . I still don ' t like that you ' re talking_about me . I don ' t want to be popular. &quot; &quot; Did I get anything wrong ? &quot; &quot; If I didn ' t want you to write it , I would n ' t have told you , &quot; she adds , shrewdly reflecting the advice most press_agents offer their celebrity clients . &quot; It ' s my simple life . But it is so. &quot; SAY GOODBY , BUBBES Tessie : The more you live , the more you learn , the more you can forget . Farshtayt ? ( &quot; Understand ? &quot; ) Pearlie : People are so good , you have no idea . Anything else you want to know , Joyala ? GRANDMA PEARLIE ' S FAMOUS FRENCH_TOAST I put_in two eggs , two large eggs . I put_in just a cup of milk . And I put_in a little drop of vanilla . You can use almond flavor or vanilla . If you don ' t want to use it , you don ' t have to use it . And a little sugar . I start off with a teaspoon and I find if I feel I need more , then I just add a little more , but don ' t forget the children put syrup on it , see , so we don ' t need it that sweet . You can use any kind of white_bread , sliced , if they like white_bread . If you like whole wheat , you use whole wheat . Now , you can fry it in butter , you can fry it in the no-fat , no-salt margarine . If I haven ' t got margarine , I use butter . Soaking the bread , that ' s the secret . You have to have your oil or butter or whatever you put_in there melted , and you mustn ' t leave it in too_much in the milk . If you leave it in too_much in the milk and the eggs , then it gets sloppy and then you can ' t have it like one piece . So you just put it in , take it out . I don ' t use too_much grease . While it ' s frying , I see if it needs it , and if it ' s starting to burn , then I just add a little more , because I try to use as little as possible . And that ' s the whole big spiel . GRANDMA TESSIE ' S AMAZING MATZO_BALL SOUP First of all , the chicken should be fresh . A good chicken . Usually , the non-Kosher chicken is not so fresh , because non-Kosher can stay in the freezer who knows how long ? But if it ' s a nice , fresh-killed chicken , I clean it up . Take_out all_the feathers and all . Clean . And then , let ' s say for a chicken , you need four pounds . It ' s a good chicken already . You put_in some water in the pot to cover the chicken . Slowly , you bring it to a boil and take_off the stuff . It gets foam , like . The fat . Nowadays an hour and a half is a lot . You cook it slowly . You put_in vegetables , like carrot and celery . I don ' t like onions . I don ' t use no pepper , just salt . Very plain . Other people put_in other stuff , yet . It ' s not like liquid when it gets cold . It ' s so like Jell-O . I take_out the carrot with a spoon or when I pour off the soup . I like the carrot . I don ' t like the celery to eat . I remember my sister Leah , she used to put_in all kinds of vegetables . And he , Harry , her husband , he ate it all , the vegetables . I couldn ' t stand it , to see him eat it . The matzo_balls , you cook it separate , not in the soup . Let ' s say I make two eggs , is more_than enough . For one person it ' s even enough one egg . And I put_in a little matzo_meal , about a half a cup . I beat it up good with a little salt . You can even put_in a drop of pepper , which is OK . A drop of seltzer makes the balls fluffier , maybe a tablespoon of seltzer . I don ' t know the measurements . that ' s why I can never give anybody any recipes . Because I just mix it and I see , when it starts getting thicker or so . It ' s important you should let it stay a_few hours , so it hardens up by itself . Then I boil up a pot of water . Throw_in the balls . But don ' t make them bigger than a walnut , or it ' ll come_out like a big peach . Let it boil for 40 minutes . And that ' s all . So what ?</TEXT>
