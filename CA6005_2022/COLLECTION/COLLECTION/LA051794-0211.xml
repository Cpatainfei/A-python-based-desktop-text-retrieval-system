   <HEADLINE> BACKERS OF ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT PETITION DELIVER SIGNATURES ; INITIATIVE : SUPPORTERS CLAIM THEY HAVE ENOUGH NAMES STATEWIDE TO QUALIFY THE TOUGH MEASURE FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bolstered by volunteers in Orange County , supporters of proposal to bar illegal immigrants in California from public hospitals and schools announced Monday they had enough signatures to qualify the initiative for the November ballot . Wearing &quot; Save Our State &quot; buttons , supporters , including sponsors and authors of the initiative , gathered Monday at the Orange County registrar of voter ' s office in Santa Ana to greet delivery of 124 # 000 signatures . Statewide , initiative backers delivered 600 # 000 signatures to election offices , more_than the 384 # 974 required to put the initiative before voters . The initiative -- among the most stringent proposals put forth in the increasingly contentious immigration debate -- is sponsored by Alan Nelson , Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner under President Ronald Reagan , and Harold Ezell , INS chief for the Western states from 1983 to 1989 . If passed , the initiative would require schools to verify the immigration status of pupils and expel students whose parents cannot prove their legal_status . Schools also would be required to report to law_enforcement agencies the names of parents they believe are in the country illegally . It would eliminate prenatal care to women who have no papers . Illegal immigrants could receive emergency care , but hospital officials would be required to report &quot; persons who are apparent illegal aliens. &quot; &quot; We ' ve allowed California to be a welfare_state for illegals too long , &quot; Ezell said Monday . Assemblyman Richard L . Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) , who backs the initiative , said at a press_conference in Santa Ana : &quot; The Legislature in Sacramento for many years has failed to act_on this issue . If the Legislature will not act , we will act . . . We don ' t want any illegals here , regardless of where they are from. &quot; Robert Kiley , Orange County political strategist for the petition drive , said the recent debate on earthquake aid for immigrants focused attention on the initiative . Gov . Pete Wilson , who has made unlawful immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign , has said that illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born children absorb $ 3 billion in education , health_care , prison and welfare costs . Critics say the numbers ignore the economic activity and tax_revenue generated by illegal immigrants . But Wilson has not taken a position on the initiative , which has been endorsed by the state GOP . A Times Poll in March found that 62 % of respondents favor the proposed initiative , including a majority of Democrats . The Democratic Party has not taken a position on the initiative . &quot; It appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to ' Yes , let ' s do something about this problem , ' &quot; said Arturo Vargas , vice_president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . &quot; I don ' t think people yet have the benefit of an analysis of how onerous this kind of Big Brother initiative is. &quot; Vargas said the initiative could lead to widespread discrimination against legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens of Latino descent . &quot; If you ' re brown , you ' re going to be suspect in this state. &quot; Arturo Montez , president of the Orange County chapter of the League of United Latin_American Citizens , said Monday that the group will seek an investigation by the secretary_of_state into the validity of the initiative signatures and petitioners . &quot; LULAC will not stand_by if this passes , &quot; he continued . &quot; We feel it is unconstitutional. &quot; The initiative drive got_off to a slow start -- petitions have been in circulation since January -- but received a big boost from the state Republican_Party , which spent $ 75 # 000 to send_out petitions . Court challenges seem certain if the initiative goes_on the ballot and is voted into law . The measure ' s educational restrictions seem to contradict a landmark 1982 Supreme Court decision , Plyler v . Doe , which held that public_schools must accept children regardless of immigration status . Initiative proponents acknowledge their desire to revisit that Supreme Court ruling , which passed_by a 5-4 majority . Illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare and many other public benefit programs , but those who are indigent can receive free emergency and prenatal care at public hospitals . Their children are legally guaranteed public_school education , and , if the children are U.S. citizens , they are eligible for welfare .</TEXT>
