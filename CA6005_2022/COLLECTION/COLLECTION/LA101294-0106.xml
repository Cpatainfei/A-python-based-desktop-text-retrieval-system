   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; BUFFER ZONE IS CONSIDERED TO THWART HUSSEIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As pressures mount for a new strategy to ensure that this Iraq crisis is the last , the Clinton_Administration may finally have to answer the central question left open by the George_Bush Administration : what to do about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ? To prevent the possibility of repetitive crises and revolving-door military deployments , military planners now face the complex issue of Iraq ' s cunning leader and his future . &quot; It ' s time to get_rid_of him . Even if his ability to attack Kuwait is eliminated , he ' s still a menace to the region , &quot; said Laurie Mylroie , author of two books on Iraq and a research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia . Most available mechanisms for punishment , from economic sanctions and political isolation to military devastation , have been tried since 1990 -- with marginal impact on Hussein ' s rule . As a result , Persian_Gulf_War allies , U.S. analysts and pivotal U.N. members are now debating options rejected four years ago for fear of a result even more ominous than Hussein ' s political survival : the fragmentation of Iraq . High on the list of new possibilities is the creation of a zone in southern Iraq where Iraqi military_forces would be excluded or their presence would be severely limited . With most of northern Kurdistan already beyond Hussein ' s control , that would effectively leave Hussein in full charge only of the central third of his country . During Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s visit to the region today , Kuwait will press the case for an exclusion zone as the only means of both constraining Hussein militarily and promoting political conditions to foster challenges to his rule . If the southern zone was large enough and the military presence sufficiently limited , dissident political activity could spring_up and lead to a form of alternative local power , as has occurred in the north . &quot; This time , the goal has to be to figure_out a long-term deterrent on Saddam and to make him understand he faces serious punishment if he engages in unacceptable behavior , &quot; said Phebe Marr , Iraq specialist at Washington ' s National Defense University . Creating an exclusion zone &quot; would certainly do that , &quot; she said . An exclusion zone was seriously considered after the 1991 Gulf War . Former U.S. Ambassador Thomas R . Pickering had mobilized consensus for it at the United Nations . But over strong objections from Pentagon officials , Gen . H . Norman Schwarzkopf vetoed the idea because of concern about the complexities of administering the southern border area and because he believed that it had &quot; no military value , &quot; according to former Bush_Administration officials . There were also concerns about breaking Iraq into three pieces based on the major ethnic and religious groups in northern Kurdistan , the Sunni-ruled center and the Shiite-dominated south . Iraq ' s dismemberment or instability was viewed_as a threat to all its neighbors , many of whom also have simmering ethnic or religious divisions . The growing consensus behind a southern exclusion zone , which the United States is now floating at the United Nations , reflects the burden of Hussein ' s ongoing rule over the intervening period . The idea of a zone is &quot; almost a must , &quot; former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz said Tuesday . &quot; We should not talk_about the notion that he can comply with U.N. resolutions and then get his power back , &quot; Wolfowitz said . &quot; As long as people think he has a future , he may have one. &quot; But even if the idea of an exclusion zone becomes policy , many issues still have to be decided , including the size of the area , the terms of exclusion and the means of enforcement . In terms of size , the largest area under_consideration begins at the 32nd Parallel and would include several Iraqi cities such_as Basra and Najaf , as well as vital oil-producing areas . The smallest area would be the largely barren desert area just north of Kuwait ' s border , U.S. analysts said . The toughest terms of exclusion could ban all troops and materiel , while the mildest ban would be of tanks and heavy equipment . And the most effective means of monitoring and enforcing compliance would include several battalions of ground troops backed_up by air- and sea-based power , while the most basic means would be the kind of air_power and air and satellite intelligence now used to monitor and protect the northern havens in Kurdistan . The parameters would depend_on the goal , according to Henri Barkey , a Lehigh University professor of international relations who has traveled extensively in demilitarized northern Iraq . &quot; If the goal is to protect Kuwait , then the terms are no tanks near the border . But if the goal is to get_rid_of Saddam , then the terms are no troops below the 32nd Parallel -- which creates a situation whereby he governs a very small chunk of territory and it becomes easier to overthrow him , &quot; he said . Keeping security_forces out of the Shiite south could help create a power vacuum that might be filled by opposition forces , potentially including the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress , a coalition now based in Kurdistan . With the backing of its Arab Persian_Gulf neighbors , Kuwait will propose to Christopher that Iraq be barred from moving large amounts of heavy armor , artillery and rockets below the 32nd Parallel , Kuwait officials said . The idea is to expand the current &quot; no-fly &quot; zone in the 150-mile-long area to exclude heavy weaponry needed to mount an attack on Kuwait . As discussed in Kuwait , the United Nations would limit the armaments that Iraq is allowed to have in the area , perhaps prohibit certain weapons entirely and set a date for compliance . Any weapons found after that date would be subject_to attack . Wright reported from Washington and Parks from Kuwait City .</TEXT>
