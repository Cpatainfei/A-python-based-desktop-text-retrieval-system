   <HEADLINE> U.S. GOES TO NEXT LEVEL , 7-1 ; HOCKEY : THEY HAVE NO TROUBLE AGAINST ITALY . UNBEATEN FINLAND IS QUARTERFINAL OPPONENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For inspiration , they watched a tape of Dan Jansen overcoming a frustrating Olympic past to win the gold medal in the 1 # 000-meter speedskating race last Friday . For incentive , they were reminded that a loss to Italy on Monday would end their Olympic medal chances and stamp them as the only U.S. hockey_team to go winless at the Games . And in case that wasn ' t enough to get them going , they had a target who was too nervous to press his pads together . Three goals in less than nine minutes , two of them long_shots through the legs of Massachusetts-born goaltender David Delfino , launched the United States to a 7-1 mauling of Italy at Haakon Hall and into the quarterfinals . The Americans ' 1-3-1 record and fourth-place finish in Group_B set_up a matchup Wednesday against Finland , which scored 25 goals and gave_up only four in rampaging through Group_A to a 5-0 record . Although it seems a mismatch , Delfino isn ' t counting the United States out , not after seeing what its determination can bring_about . &quot; They came_out hard . We had to be prepared and I guess we weren ' t . Maybe I psyched myself out a little , &quot; said Delfino , who grew_up with U.S. center David Sacco and played in summer leagues with other American Olympians . &quot; I ' m not saying we would have won the game , but at least it could have been respectable . . . . Their work ethic is great and they never give_up . I think they have a good shot at a medal. &quot; He had no shot Monday against a team that found his weak_spot -- along with the motivation it had lacked . &quot; I felt kind of bad for him , &quot; said Sacco , who banked a shot off Delfino for the third goal , the last before the starting goalie was replaced by Bruno Campese . &quot; I wish he ' d had a better game , but he could have stood on his head and beat us , too , and I would n ' t have liked that . . . . We needed a win to stay alive , and that ' s all I knew. &quot; Knowing that , however , might not have been enough . To strengthen the team ' s fluttery emotional pulse , strength and conditioning coach Jack Blatherwick assembled a tape of Jansen ' s world-record performance and showed it to the players during a team meeting Sunday . The message hit_home . &quot; The true courage he had , an unbelievable athlete who conquered everything in his sport except a gold medal and then in his last race won it and set a world_record , well , I wasn ' t really crying , but it was a pretty emotional moment , &quot; Sacco said . &quot; The sentiments were , whatever you want to do , you can accomplish it if you believe , and this team believes_in itself. &quot; Said U.S. goalie Garth Snow : &quot; It showed a guy who ' s faced a lot of adversity and who ' s really excelled over adversity . It seems like he ' s kept a really good attitude through it all . It was really inspirational. &quot; Peter Ciavaglia began the rout Monday with a blast from the right circle at 1:50 , and Peter Ferraro kept it going at 3:59 with the first of his two goals . After Sacco ' s power-play goal sent Delfino to the bench , the scoring resumed against Campese at 13:03 on a wrist shot by David Roberts . Brian Rolston , celebrating his 21st birthday , also scored twice as each of the four U.S. lines contributed at least one goal . Rolston has scored in four of the five games here and shares the tournament goal-scoring lead with Slovakia ' s Miroslav Satan at seven each . In their only pre-Olympic meeting , the United States defeated Finland , 6-2 , on Dec . 16 at the Izvestia Cup tournament in Moscow . Since then , however , both teams have changed their rosters , and Finland is challenging for its first gold medal . U.S. Coach Tim Taylor said the Finns , &quot; had a marvelous tournament . . . ( but ) our players will play with determination and confidence . You can ' t go_in with the fear to fail. &quot; They succeeded in fine fashion Monday . &quot; Technically , we needed a tie to get_in , but if we had come_in tonight and tied the game , I don ' t think our psyche would have been in good_shape , &quot; Ciavaglia said . &quot; I don ' t think we could have designed anything better for a situation when everything ' s riding_on one game. &quot; Their hopes now ride_on Wednesday ' s single-elimination game . &quot; Right now , everyone ' s 0-0-0 , and we ' re pretty positive going into the medal round , &quot; said Snow , who is sure to start in goal . &quot; We ' re Americans and we ' re not going_to go_in there afraid . We ' re going in with a lot of confidence . We can play with anybody. &quot; * Canadian goaltender Corey Hirsch couldn ' t help admiring Sweden ' s precise and uncanny passes . &quot; It can be mesmerizing , &quot; he said . &quot; But you can ' t let them do_it to you. &quot; Hirsch and his teammates didn ' t let Sweden get_away with much , recording a 3-2 victory that earned them a second-place finish in Group_B . Hirsch faced 36 shots , including 17 in the first_period , as Canada ( 3-1-1 ) and seeded fourth , moved_on to a medal-round matchup against the Czech Republic . In losing , Sweden ( 3-1-1 ) missed a chance to win the group title and instead dropped to third , setting_up a quarterfinal matchup against Germany on Wednesday . Slovakia beat France , 6-2 , and finished first in Group_B with a 3-0-2 record .</TEXT>
