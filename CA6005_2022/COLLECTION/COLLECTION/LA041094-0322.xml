   <HEADLINE> POLICY DISPUTES WEAKEN JAPAN ' S SHAKY COALITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s rainbow coalition confronted the threat of a breakup Saturday as leaders of its eight parties failed to agree on policies that a successor to outgoing Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should follow . They promised to choose a new leader from within their ranks and elect him prime_minister by the end of this week . But quarrels among themselves undermined the credibility of their pledge . Leaders of the Japan Renewal Party and the Buddhist-backed Komei ( Clean Government ) Party insisted that without a new policy agreement , they would balk at forming a new Cabinet within the present framework of seven parties in the lower house and eight in the upper chamber of Parliament . But the Socialists , whose leftist policies repeatedly hampered Hosokawa during his eight months in office , rejected any new agreement . At stake are tax reforms , considered essential to support measures to end a three-year recession , and how a new Cabinet will deal with U.S.-Japan economic frictions and continuing fears of a North_Korean nuclear_weapons program . Hosokawa ' s shock resignation came Friday , but he will stay_on as caretaker until his successor is chosen . Failure of the eight parties to agree on a new leader would fracture the coalition and force its segments to turn_to the Liberal Democrats for help . Even united , the coalition holds only a five-seat majority in the lower house , which elects the prime_minister . Meanwhile , new splits within the coalition -- as well as the possibility of one within the Liberal Democratic Party , which lost its 38-year grasp on power last summer -- appeared one after another . Hosokawa officially broke his once close relationship with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura , head of the New Party Harbinger , by removing 40 of his followers from a joint parliamentary negotiating body and registering them in a new group under his sole leadership . Later , however , about 10 of the Hosokawa followers indicated they would break_with him and join Takemura . Leaders of the Renewal and Komei parties again put_out feelers to former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe , the leader of the Liberal Democrats ' third-largest faction , urging him to bolt his party and head a new coalition as prime_minister . On Saturday , Watanabe all but accepted the invitation . Asked what he would do if support for him as a non-Liberal Democrat prime_minister emerged , Watanabe replied : &quot; Any member_of_Parliament would accept such an offer . that ' s why we spend decades serving in Parliament. &quot; Mathematics remained the main obstacle . A Watanabe candidacy would be certain to rupture the present coalition , and whether Watanabe could bring enough LDP defectors with him to paste together a majority was unclear . Socialists , Democratic Socialists and the Harbinger party all spoke out against choosing the coalition ' s most obvious candidate , Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata , the titular leader of the Renewal Party . They cited his close ties with Ichiro Ozawa , the forceful deputy chief of the Renewal Party who served as Hosokawa ' s top strategist and often pushed policies they opposed . So fluid was the situation that , among Japan ' s 10 parties , only the Communists , who have been excluded from the maneuvering , appeared free_of fears of an intraparty split . Minoru Morita , a highly respected political commentator , predicted that the coalition will agree to ignore its disputes and pick Hata by next Saturday . Chiaki Imamura , political editor of TV Asahi , speculated on the political realignment but could narrow the possibilities to no fewer than three coalition mixtures with a total of seven possible successors to Hosokawa . Even Imamura ' s multifaceted speculation omitted one remote possibility -- that the Liberal Democrats might ultimately form a coalition . The Liberal Democrats , whose 219 seats fall 37 short of a majority but make them the biggest party in the lower house , would need only one coalition partner to elect a prime_minister . Help from either the Renewal Party , which holds 60 seats , or the Komei Party , with 52 seats , would do the trick . On Saturday , Yoshiro Mori , the Liberal Democrats ' secretary_general , announced that his party would consider supporting a non-LDP leader as prime_minister -- a lure apparently designed to produce an LDP-dominated government . The vacuum created by Hosokawa ' s resignation threatens both U.S.-Japan economic relations and hopes for economic recovery . Japan had promised to hammer_out by June both a master_plan for reducing and removing government regulations that inhibit imports and competition within Japan and a more forceful program to spur growth in the stagnant economy . Without strong leadership from a prime_minister , little progress is expected . Liberal Democrats , who had halted budget deliberations for a month to press Hosokawa to clarify suspicious financial transactions , finally agreed Saturday to participate in debate on the budget_for fiscal 1994 , which began April 1 . Deliberations , however , cannot proceed until a new Cabinet is named .</TEXT>
