   <HEADLINE> D.A. READIES FOR TACTICS OF SIMPSON DEFENSE ; CRIME : GARCETTI SAYS A CLAIM OF MENTAL INCAPACITY WOULD NOT SURPRISE HIM . ARRAIGNMENT IS SET FOR TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Los Angeles County district_attorney said Sunday he anticipates that O.J. Simpson and his attorneys likely will argue that the former football star was mentally incapacitated and therefore not responsible_for the stabbing deaths of his ex-wife and a male friend . &quot; It would n ' t surprise me if at some point we go from , ' I didn ' t do_it ' to ' I did_it , but I ' m not responsible , ' &quot; Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said . If that happens , he said , prosecutors will &quot; be waiting &quot; and &quot; have no difficulty in overcoming that defense. &quot; Simpson met with his attorney , Robert Shapiro , at the Central Jail , but Shapiro declined to talk_about his client ' s defense until after an arraignment scheduled for this morning in Downtown Los Angeles . Simpson was charged Friday in the June 12 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . The comments from the attorneys on both sides came during another day of impassioned nationwide discussion and speculation about the case . Both sides have sought to influence public perceptions ; Garcetti spent much of the weekend appearing on national television to focus attention on the victims , while Shapiro described his client ' s fragile mental_state . On his way into the Sunday visit , Shapiro told a mob of reporters that Simpson &quot; wished me a happy Father ' s Day , and told me to spend the morning with my children . And then he started to cry , and said , ' I wish I could spend Father ' s Day with my children. ' &quot; Shapiro also said he had delivered a &quot; special message &quot; to Simpson from the Rev . Billy Graham . Asked how his client will plead at the hearing , Shapiro said only that &quot; O.J. will be there. &quot; When told of Shapiro ' s comments in an interview with The Times , Garcetti became agitated and said &quot; there is no doubt that the heartstrings are being pulled. &quot; &quot; It annoys me that we are beginning to lose focus that the true victims in this case are Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman , their parents and the children of Nicole Simpson , &quot; he said . &quot; Those are the people we should truly be feeling sorry for. &quot; Sunday night , in a taped interview for ABC ' s &quot; Good_Morning America at Night , &quot; two of Nicole Brown Simpson ' s sisters , Dominique , 29 , and Denise , 36 , told of how the family has built a &quot; shrine &quot; to Nicole inside their parents ' Monarch Bay house to help ease their grief during an emotional week . They also said they are continuing to shield O.J. and Nicole Simpson ' s two children , Sydney , 9 , and Justin , 6 , from new reports . The children are at the home of their grandparents , Louis and Juditha Brown . Although they tried to put a positive light on the family ' s emotional_state , Denise Brown told the show ' s co-host , Joan Lunden , &quot; Joan , we ' re just hanging_in there. &quot; They said they decided to speak publicly as an opportunity to show their sister in &quot; a different light. &quot; Little was mentioned about their sister ' s relationship with her former husband , including Simpson ' s conviction for spousal abuse . When Lunden questioned them about the relationship , the sisters spoke mainly of Nicole Simpson ' s love for her children . At the Monarch Bay residence of the children ' s grandparents , television_sets are never turned_on , to protect the children , they said . Cousins of the two Simpson children are nearly the same age and are ready playmates . On the subject of emotion , the sisters said their father has made a special rule . In the mornings , they ' ve created &quot; hug time , &quot; an opportunity that has made_it easier on the family , they said . Also , they ' ve erected a shrine to their slain sister , made of pictures of Nicole and candles . &quot; Every morning I wake_up , &quot; Denise Brown said , &quot; I go outside and light the candles , look_at her picture . . . make some coffee and I talk to Nicole. &quot; Among the public , there has been an outpouring of public sympathy for the football Hall of Famer . Supporters gathered along freeways to shout encouragement to Simpson as he and his friend Al Cowlings , trailed by a cavalcade of police_cars , made a suspenseful journey Friday that ended with his surrender at his Brentwood mansion . His arrest by a police SWAT team was a spellbinding ending to a drama that heightened with each day . Simpson emerged as a suspect soon after the bodies of his ex-wife and Goldman were found late Sunday outside her Brentwood townhouse . By week ' s end , well-wishers had put signs at the mansion ' s gate with messages such_as &quot; We You O.J. &quot; &quot; He was someone to look_up_to all those years , &quot; said Jeff Gibson , 24 , of Placentia . &quot; I just wanted to be here to show some support. &quot; While in jail Simpson can read books from the library and buy newspapers and magazines . After his arraignment he will be allowed one visitor per day , in addition to his attorney and psychiatrist , Los Angeles County sheriff ' s spokesman Larry Mead said . With the image of Simpson languishing in a 9-by-7-foot jail_cell still sinking_in , much of the country spent Father ' s Day trying to understand how he got there and searching for lessons to be drawn from the tragedy . Simpson and the events leading_up to his arrest were the topic of discussion on three major television network news_programs . The drama was dissected for insights into the sometimes rocky relationship between Los Angeles police and the public ; the difference between celebrities and heroes , and the mishandling and misunderstanding of domestic violence . &quot; People have been talking_about O.J. Simpson as a hero , &quot; said former Secretary_of_Education William Bennett , appearing on CBS ' s &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think he was a hero . We confuse real heroism with celebrity and we confuse celebrity . . . with significance. &quot; Several of the television_shows also focused_on the issue of domestic violence . Simpson pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor spousal battery of Nicole Brown Simpson but critics and prosecutors contend he got_off too lightly because he avoided jail time . &quot; If O.J. Simpson had walked into his boss ' s office and punched him in the face , as he apparently did to his wife , it would not have been treated the same way , &quot; said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala on &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; &quot; Violence , whether it happens in the home or outside the home , is sheer violence and it ' s unacceptable. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . David Conn , who heads the special trials unit and who also appeared on &quot; Face the Nation , &quot; described Nicole Simpson ' s slaying as a classic &quot; domestic violence killing. &quot; The Simpson case not only dominated the television networks , it also found its way into the pulpit . During Mass at St . Martin of Tours Catholic_Church in Brentwood , Nicole Simpson ' s parish , the Rev . Donie O ' Ceochain said it was &quot; almost prophetic &quot; that the week ' s scriptural readings &quot; deal with storm and stress , fear , anxiety , unanswered questions , helplessness , seeking answers and human vulnerability. &quot; &quot; It ' s been a sad week in Brentwood , &quot; he said . &quot; We have all been touched. &quot; The Brentwood townhouse where the killing occurred and Simpson ' s nearby mansion became familiar symbols of tragedy last week . Residents of the affluent Westside enclave tried Sunday to ease back_out of the spotlight . Two police_officers directed pedestrian and vehicle_traffic in front of the townhouse as curiosity-seekers continued to converge at the site where last week ' s tragedy began . The crowds were so intense that the family living next door moved_out temporarily to escape the attention . Christian Coe , president of the the South Brentwood Homeowners Assn. , said he spent part of the day talking with police and traffic officials about where to install &quot; no stopping , &quot; &quot; no parking &quot; and &quot; tow-away &quot; signs to discourage visitors . &quot; For God ' s sake , people were butchered to death in there , &quot; said Philip Alexander , who lives about 75 yards away . &quot; People think this is Disneyland or something. &quot; In Dana Point , the family of Nicole Brown Simpson gathered at the Monarch Bay home for Father ' s Day . They went_to brunch and then some family members went_to the beach to relax . Meanwhile , court officials made hurried preparations for Simpson ' s arraignment today . Throngs of reporters are expected to attend the court hearing , and officials were worried that disruptive crowds of onlookers could gather . &quot; We will have very heavy security , &quot; said sheriff ' s spokesman Mead . Rather than being transported in a jail bus , the way most prisoners are , Simpson is to be taken alone . &quot; Whatever route is taken_to the Criminal_Courts Building will be secret . We are not disclosing any plans , &quot; Mead said . Public interest in the Simpson case has been so intense that the Sheriff ' s Department set_up a special address for letters to the inmate given Booking No . 4013970 : P.O. Box 86164 , Los Angeles . Garcetti said he expects the arraignment to be continued . Sources said Saturday that prosecutors have begun presenting evidence to a grand_jury to win an indictment of Simpson . Garcetti on Sunday would not deny but also would not confirm that the grand_jury proceedings had begun . In any case , Garcetti has said the start of a trial is at least months away , and he promised to make_sure that Simpson is not released on bail . &quot; He is not entitled to bail by law , &quot; he said . &quot; We will do everything in our power to be sure that he does not have bail assigned to him. &quot; The district_attorney conceded that the prosecution ' s &quot; most profound challenge &quot; will be selecting 12 jurors who will unanimously agree with the prosecution . &quot; The defense is always just looking_for that one juror who might hang them up , &quot; Garcetti said .
