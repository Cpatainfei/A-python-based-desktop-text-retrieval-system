   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; THE AMY CHRONICLES ; AFTER YEARS IN THE SHADOW OF HER PARENTS , NOT TO MENTION EX-HUSBAND STEVEN SPIELBERG , AMY IRVING IS NOW SECURE IN HER OWN IDENTITY . ' I ' VE NEVER BEEN SO ALIVE , ' SAYS STAR OF ARTHUR MILLER ' S NEW PLAY , ' BROKEN GLASS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sitting in a restaurant here , Amy Irving looks as if she could well be an extra from ex-husband Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; With no makeup , a babushka taming her frizzy brunet curls and a long gray shawl draped over her shoulders , the blue-eyed actress conveys a picture of severe beauty and intensity . But Irving ' s character is a Jewish refugee not of an Eastern European pogrom but of 1938 Brooklyn . She has just finished a performance of &quot; Broken Glass , &quot; Arthur Miller ' s new Broadway drama . And though Sylvia Gellburg , the character she plays , is 3 # 000 miles from the horrors of the incipient Nazi Holocaust , they are still very much present in her thoughts and dreams . &quot; The first time I imagined Sylvia ' s nightmares in the play , I pictured Ralph Fiennes , &quot; Irving says , referring to the actor who played a Nazi officer in &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Irving , interviewed after a Saturday matinee at the Long Wharf Theater , where the drama is trying_out before bowing on Broadway next Sunday , continues : &quot; This woman is sitting in Brooklyn but she ' s imagining herself in the situation of the Jews in Berlin after Kristallnacht . Steven ' s film immediately came_to my mind because the images were so haunting. &quot; It doesn ' t take long for Spielberg ' s name to crop_up . The surprise is that Irving is the one to bring it up , given the fact that a good_part of the actress ' s life and career has been spent in the glare and the shadow of being first Spielberg ' s girlfriend ; then his wife and the mother of their child , Max , and now the ex-Mrs . Spielberg , happily coupled with Brazilian film director Bruno Barreto , with whom she has another son , Gabriel . In that regard , Amy Irving has always been another sort of refugee , one who has escaped the distortions of Hollywood through periodic forays in the theater . Now , after the dismal failures of her movies &quot; A Show of Force &quot; ( a 1990 film directed by Barreto ) and &quot; Benefit of the Doubt &quot; ( 1993 ) , Irving has once again returned to a place that has been welcoming her since a 1980 Broadway debut in &quot; Amadeus. &quot; While her ex-husband glories in unprecedented commercial and artistic success , the 40-year-old actress finds herself working for relatively little money at a small regional theater -- though she says she loves every torturous , nerve-racking moment . &quot; It ' s exciting , it ' s terrifying , and I ' ve never been so alive , &quot; Irving says , sipping a glass of mineral_water and nursing a swollen lower lip , the result of an accident that occurred in a blackout that ends the show . &quot; I ' ve never created a role for the theater before . You ' re given new pages , you try them , and they don ' t work and you feel so exposed . But everyone tells me : ' Be patient . we ' ll get there . This is the way the theater works. ' &quot; ( Indeed , the rigors of mounting a new play would take their toll in the succeeding weeks when , just before the play departed New Haven for Broadway , it was announced that David Dukes would replace Ron Silver in_the_lead role of Dr. Harry Hyman. ) * On first glance , Irving ' s choice for her return to the theater seems at_odds with the astringent beauty and spunkiness that have imbued her previous roles onstage ( &quot; The Heidi Chronicles &quot; ) and often in film ( &quot; Crossing Delancey , &quot; &quot; Yentl &quot; ) . Sylvia Gellburg is a Brooklyn woman stricken with a sudden hysteric paralysis . Harry Hyman , her doctor , uncovers some clues for the medical mystery : her near-psychic identification with the suffering of the Jews in Germany , which she obsessively reads about in the newspapers , and , more notably , her self-hating martinet of a husband . As she becomes increasingly emotionally involved with Hyman , Sylvia begins to realize that what she sees as the passivity of the European Jews echoes her marital resignation , sparking in her a personal uprising . &quot; She has a lot bubbling_up in her , &quot; Irving says . &quot; No one will ever think_of me as a delicate , fragile woman after this play. &quot; Nor would they think that if they ever met her in_person . While Irving is agreeable when someone approaches her for an autograph in the restaurant , what she communicates most is clarity and directness . She doesn ' t suffer fools gladly . Still , although Irving may share Sylvia Gellburg ' s moxie , as one character puts it , the similarities end there . Miller ' s description of the character in the play -- &quot; She is in her mid-40s , a buxom , capable and warm woman &quot; -- indicates the playwright and director John Tillinger decided to go_in a different direction when they cast Irving . In fact , Dianne Wiest had initially been announced for the role but backed_out because , Tillinger said , &quot; she couldn ' t give it the time and energy that the role required. &quot; &quot; I suppose there are people who will still say she ' s too young for the part , &quot; Tillinger says of Irving . &quot; But there ' s no question she has the right emotional makeup for this highly strung woman . We felt that those strengths would override any reservations that she wasn ' t physically right. &quot; Irving got the chance to join the company , which also includes Ron Rifkin and Frances Conroy , in December when she received a copy of the play_at the Santa Monica home she shares with Barreto , 4-year-old Gabriel , 8-year-old Max and Helena , Barreto ' s 17-year-old daughter by a previous marriage . Since Miller was not familiar_with Irving ' s theater work , the producers were keen for her to fly to New York to audition for the playwright . &quot; I wanted to hate this play , &quot; Irving says , alluding to the disruptions that doing the play would visit on her family . &quot; But then I read it . I showed it to my mother ( actress Priscilla Pointer ) and she said , ' Go . Do_it . Your family will survive. ' &quot; On a December morning just after seeing a private screening of &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; Irving flew to New York and auditioned . &quot; How do you know this woman so well ? &quot; Miller asked of Irving after she had read the first scene of the play . Although she quickly won the part , there was still some question among the creative team as_to whether Irving could pull it off . Makeup , after all , could only fade her beauty so_much . &quot; They were all concerned , &quot; Irving says . &quot; But I ' ve had a lot of experience in my life . I have a lot to draw_on . It ' s not just the obvious marriage f---ups . It ' s a lot of , you know , growing_up . . . loss , whether it ' s through death , career disappointments , marriage failures . I ' ve spent a lot of time exploring very strong issues with my father , very strong issues with Steven , very strong issues with my husband ( she calls Barreto her husband , though they are not legally wed ) . I ' ve had very intense relationships all along the way , and they ' ve all , in one way or another , involved a loss of identity . I can ' t be more specific than that. &quot; &quot; Amy ' s a very complicated person , &quot; says Rifkin , who plays her husband in the drama and recommended her for the role . &quot; There are a lot of layers to her . And the more you get_to know her , the more layers you discover underneath those layers . She has the maturity that comes from knowing that life is_full of surprises , some of them pleasant and some of them painful . Like any good actor , she can translate those deep feelings into her work . I think she ' s a lot more like Sylvia than anybody thought. &quot; Irving struggled for her own identity from early on , as the daughter of Pointer and her husband , distinguished director Jules Irving . Irving ' s paternal grandfather was a Russian Jewish immigrant , and she says she has drawn_on that heritage to create the Jewish characters she has played in &quot; Crossing Delancey , &quot; &quot; Yentl &quot; and now &quot; Broken Glass. &quot; She was reared a Christian_Scientist , however , and the family observed no religious customs or traditions . &quot; I ' m not an advocate of organized religion , &quot; she says resolutely . &quot; I really leave my children ' s religious education to their fathers . Max gets his sense of Jewishness from Steven ; Gabriel gets his Catholicism from Bruno. &quot; The altar in the Irving household was the stage . Along with her brother , David , now a film director and teacher , and her sister , Katie , who works with deaf children in Santa Fe , N.M. , Irving literally grew_up in the theater . &quot; I can ' t imagine a more wonderful way of growing_up , &quot; she says of her youth , spent first in San Francisco , where her father headed the prestigious Actor ' s Workshop , and then in New York , where he was appointed director of the Lincoln Center Repertory Theater . Pointer was a leading member of her husband ' s repertory of actors . &quot; Instead of using baby-sitters , Mama would put us in the front row where she could watch us from the stage , &quot; Irving recalls . &quot; My father was an amazing artistic director , and the values of the Actor ' s Workshop were special . It was about the work , not money or fame . Things were very disillusioning when I got_out into the real world. &quot; After studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and the American Conservatory Theatre , Irving worked in the competitive arena of Los Angeles theater , where actors kept one eye cocked for a spot on &quot; Starsky and Hutch. &quot; Despite her dismay at the bald ambition , Irving initially thrived in that environment . She was soon making a splashy film debut in Brian De Palma ' s &quot; Carrie &quot; ( 1976 ) , which she followed with the director ' s &quot; The Fury &quot; ( 1978 ) . &quot; The most shocking thing to me was that talent or training had little or nothing to do with it , &quot; Irving says . &quot; The reason people were working was because they were a type or a look . I couldn ' t really complain , because my career was happening as fast as I might ' ve wanted it to . Working with De Palma was great -- completely strange -- but great. &quot; About this time , Irving met Spielberg through George Lucas ( she had auditioned for but lost out on the part of Princess Leia in &quot; Star Wars &quot; ) . The attraction was instantaneous but volatile from the start , exacerbated by the director ' s growing profile . After several years together , the two split_up in the early ' 80s . Irving gave_up the role she was set to play in &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark &quot; and took_stock of her life in an adobe_house high above Santa Fe . &quot; You start_out being Jules Irving ' s daughter , &quot; Irving said at the time , &quot; and you finally break_away from that to become Amy Irving , and then you become Steven Spielberg ' s girlfriend , and , well , I was having an identity_crisis . I had to take positive action and get a new sense of myself. &quot; The positive action led her to the New York stage , earning good reviews and , more important , her exacting father ' s approval , when she took_over the role of Constanza , Mozart ' s wife , in &quot; Amadeus &quot; in 1980 . Irving says it was one of the happiest times of her life , and more success followed in movies , including Barbra Streisand ' s &quot; Yentl &quot; ( 1983 ) , for which she was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress , and Joan Micklin Silver ' s &quot; Crossing Delancey &quot; ( 1988 ) . &quot; I didn ' t want to do ' Yentl ' at first , &quot; Irving says now . &quot; I thought Hadass was just this submissive and pretty little airhead , but Barbra ' s a hard woman to say no to. &quot; Irving ' s successes on film and stage gave her enough confidence to resume her relationship with Spielberg in 1985 . When she became pregnant with Max , the couple decided to tie the knot in a private civil ceremony in Santa Fe later that year . While Spielberg continued to develop and oversee projects in his film empire , Irving opted largely for television ( &quot; Anastasia , &quot; &quot; Far Pavilions &quot; ) and theater ( &quot; The Road to Mecca &quot; ) . She received few film offers , but she did get a chance to try_out a sultry vocal technique when she dubbed in the singing voice of Jessica Rabbit in 1988 ' s &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit , &quot; for which Spielberg was an executive producer . The marriage , however , soon started to show the strains of an ambitious couple pursuing their private agendas . And Irving continued to rankle under her unofficial status as consort to the Prince of Hollywood . &quot; During my marriage to Steven , I felt_like a politician ' s wife , &quot; she says . &quot; There were certain things expected of me that definitely weren ' t me . One of my problems is that I ' m very honest and direct . You pay a price for that . But then I behaved myself and I paid a price too. &quot; Irving made_it clear , however , that it was she , more_than her husband , who placed those pressures on herself . The marriage ended amicably in 1989 amid reports in the press of a divorce settlement of about $ 100 million . Spielberg married actress Kate Capshaw in 1991 . Irving almost immediately became involved with director Barreto ( &quot; Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands &quot; ) . They met when he cast her for the role of a spirited Puerto Rican television_reporter who uncovers political chicanery in &quot; A Show of Force , &quot; which was critically panned and fared poorly at the box_office . Their relationship , however , bloomed . Suddenly , Irving was dancing samba and singing in full costume at Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro , speaking Portuguese in the couple ' s home_in the coastal resort of Buzios , north of the city . &quot; I think I was just as surprised as everybody else , &quot; she says . &quot; I didn ' t want to get involved that quickly , and Bruno and I tried to keep our relationship professional at first . But being exposed to this Brazilian world has enriched me in multiples . I ' ve enjoyed it -- a lot ! This has been the happiest relationship of my life. &quot; Barreto has been supportive of her professional_life , even if that has meant occasionally uprooting family . But the film offers , somewhat to her chagrin , remain meager . Acknowledging that she finds the self-promotion necessary for stardom to be &quot; hideous , &quot; Irving says that at_the_same_time , she is frustrated by her lack of options . &quot; I was out there trying , &quot; she says . &quot; I couldn ' t get meetings . I couldn ' t beg through the door. &quot; Could Hollywood ' s cold_shoulder have been caused , at least in part , by her split from the powerful Spielberg ? &quot; I think it hurt being Steven Spielberg ' s wife , &quot; she says , &quot; and then it hurt being the ex-Mrs . Steven Spielberg . It was awkward for a while . I don ' t know why . I only know that I felt nonexistent. &quot; In addition , Irving has had a reputation for being difficult with some producers . &quot; I absolutely never found that to be the case , &quot; says Micklin Silver , who directed Irving in what is widely considered to be her best film role , &quot; Crossing Delancey. &quot; &quot; Amy is a pleasure . She has a great delicacy as an actress that I appreciated . She was never on a star trip , always the professional and generous to a fault. &quot; But Irving is the first to say that some producers would n ' t agree . &quot; I get_along great with directors , but I think some producers would tell you I ' m a pain , &quot; Irving notes . &quot; They may say I ' m tough to work with , but I have a great passion for what I do . I believe_in fighting for it. &quot; One production source at Warner Bros. , which produced two of Irving ' s films ( &quot; Crossing Delancey &quot; and 1980 ' s &quot; Honeysuckle Rose &quot; ) , agreed with Irving ' s assessment , saying that she was considered by some at the studio to be very difficult . Brian De Palma , on the other hand , says , &quot; She was a delight to work with. &quot; Although De Palma used Irving in two films nearly back to back , he has not used her since . &quot; She just wasn ' t right for the roles &quot; in his other pictures . &quot; But I would work with her again anytime. &quot; Asked if he ever felt any implied pressure from his close friend Spielberg when working with Irving , De Palma laughs . &quot; I was married to an actress ( Nancy Allen ) at the time whom Steven used in two of his films , &quot; he says , referring to &quot; 1941 &quot; and &quot; I Wanna Hold Your Hand , &quot; which Spielberg produced . &quot; Anybody who says that is ridiculous . Steven would never put pressure on anyone for something like that . Amy is a talent in her own right. &quot; Irving says that at most the Spielberg factor is just one possible explanation : &quot; There were other aspects ; I ' m not 20 years old , and I haven ' t been in blockbusters. &quot; that ' s something of an understatement . Last summer ' s &quot; Benefit of the Doubt &quot; earned Irving some good reviews as a tough-talking blond cocktail waitress opposite Donald Sutherland , but the film , a thriller with heavy scenes of father-daughter incest , flopped . Her most recent film , &quot; Kleptomania , &quot; directed by Dan Boyd ( &quot; Twenty-One &quot; ) and produced by Carol Curb Nemoy , in which Irving plays a spoiled socialite who also happens to be a kleptomaniac , may never see the light of day because of differences between the director and the producer . ( &quot; The urge to steal has a lot to do with a lack of love and loss of sexuality in her life , &quot; Irving says . &quot; The character is very interesting . . . and far different from anything I ' ve ever known. &quot; ) Irving has also finished a role in a &quot; Twilight Zone &quot; CBS movie that will air next month . &quot; I ' ve gone from ' low-budget ' movies to ' no-budget , ' &quot; she says with a rueful laugh . &quot; I think ' Kleptomania ' is the best work I ' ve ever done . I put my heart and soul in that film , and it breaks my heart that it may never get released . And so you let_go and move_on , and just as my heart ' s breaking over that , Arthur Miller ' s asking me , ' How do you know this woman so well ? ' I would n ' t trade doing this play for the biggest film . &quot; People shouldn ' t waste time thinking_about what happened to Amy , &quot; Irving says , a little snappishly . &quot; I ' m living_in a very beautiful , intimate way . Maybe I ' m less ambitious , but my life is so full . So excuse me for having an incredibly wonderful life. &quot; After her run in &quot; Broken Glass &quot; ends , Irving plans to do a movie with a Brazilian friend , but she doesn ' t foresee working with either Spielberg or Barreto anytime soon . &quot; I ' d do a movie with Steven , &quot; she says , &quot; but I think it would be awkward for him . Our friendship is very valuable to us , and that would probably put a strain on it. &quot; In fact , Spielberg ' s company , Amblin Entertainment , is producing Barreto ' s new film , &quot; Casanova , &quot; starring Antonio Banderas . But while Irving maintains that she is &quot; too old &quot; for a part in the movie , she does say that she and her stepdaughter , Helena , plan to visit the set_in Spain . &quot; We ' re just going_to watch from the sidelines and drool_over Banderas. &quot; Meanwhile , Irving has been happy to be a homemaker and mother . Her concerns these days include helping her young boys navigate the shoals of celebrity as they show indications of following in the footsteps of their famous parents . &quot; Gabriel hasn ' t really mentioned it , but he ' s already an actor , &quot; she says . &quot; Every once in a while Max says he wants to be in a movie , but I won ' t let him . If he ' s serious about it , let him get some training first . Let him earn it . Just don ' t go and be a celebrity . He ' s famous enough . He really wants to be a director . God knows , he ' s got a hard act to follow . &quot; I just want to expose them to enough so that they realize there are other choices , &quot; she adds a little hopefully . More_than most celebrities , Irving has been especially successful in protecting her public image , even if she has emerged as something of an ice princess in the press . Lucky , to be sure , but also certain of her prerogatives . &quot; I ' m not a princess , &quot; she says . &quot; There are a lot of givens that don ' t necessarily make_for happiness . I ' ve had a lot of s--- to swallow and stuff to work_out . I have scars nobody knows about . &quot; Sure , my life looks hunky-dory to someone living_in Tucson . They read ( the tabloids ) -- lies_about things that didn ' t happen and things they say I ' ve gotten that I haven ' t gotten . But if I don ' t have pain , I don ' t grow . I like to take chances . I like to get hurt . I like to jump in and have it slapped back in my face . Otherwise , I ' ll just be like Sylvia Gellburg . Life will just close over you like a grave. &quot;</TEXT>
