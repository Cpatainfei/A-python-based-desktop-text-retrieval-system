   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CLAUDIA ELLER : COMPANY TOWN ; DREAM TEAM MAY GET NEW PLAYER : BILL GATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is in advanced discussions about investing in the fledgling Hollywood studio headed by Jeffrey Katzenberg , Steven Spielberg and David Geffen , knowledgeable sources said Thursday . The precise nature of Gates ' possible involvement in the venture is unclear . Sources say he would probably serve as both an investor and technology adviser . Interestingly , they say Gates has also let it be known that he harbors directing ambitions . Gates ' name first surfaced in connection with the studio in October , when Katzenberg , Spielberg and Geffen announced they were joining forces . At the time , they shot down reports that Gates and others were involved . On Thursday , all_of the parties declined to comment . Sources , who have called the previous reports of Gates ' possible involvement premature , say the talks have recently taken_on a more serious cast . But they also warn that Gates has been known to back_away from promising-looking discussions before . Gates , 38 , has the resources to play_at any level in Hollywood . He ranks at the top of the latest Forbes list of the 400 richest individuals , with a reported net worth of $ 9.35 billion . His wealth is derived from the runaway success of Redmond , Wash.-based Microsoft , the world ' s largest computer software company , which he started with classmate Paul G . Allen in 1975 . Gates is said to be intrigued by Hollywood , and he has been linked in the past to discussions with Creative Artists Agency Chairman and industry matchmaker Michael S . Ovitz . The nature of Gates ' relationship to the studio partners is also unclear . * Gates , Ovitz , Katzenberg and Geffen know one another , and all were at investment_banker Herbert Allen Jr. ' s annual Sun Valley retreat last summer . Katzenberg , Spielberg and Geffen are said to be seeking as much as $ 2 billion in backing for their unnamed studio . Meanwhile , their company is gradually taking_shape . On Monday they announced a $ 200-million joint_venture with Capital Cities / ABC to develop television_programs . And on Wednesday they announced that Helene Hahn , Katzenberg ' s longtime head of business affairs when he was Disney studio chairman , will oversee all business and legal affairs for the new studio . The three are also said to be in advanced negotiations to take_over space in Playa del Rey . * Phoenix Pictures , the entertainment company being formed by veteran Hollywood executives Mike Medavoy , Peter Hoffman and Arnold Messer , appears to be close to taking_flight . The Phoenix partners have spent the past several months globe-trotting in search of investor backing . Hoffman declined to comment on reports that the company expects to set_out with $ 75 million to $ 100 million in seed money , but he did say things are &quot; very close &quot; to coming_together . Sony Pictures Entertainment , Medavoy ' s old employer , is said to be one likely backer as a co-financier and / or distributor of movies produced by Phoenix , but sources said there are separate discussions with other studios . Medavoy headed Sony ' s TriStar Pictures unit until January . The Phoenix partners are also in talks with Onex Corp. , a Toronto-based company with $ 1.4 billion in assets and interests in everything from auto parts to airline catering . Hoffman , a former Carolco Pictures executive , heads a production , packaging and consulting company called CineVision . Medavoy supervised the production of Oscar-winning films such_as &quot; Platoon &quot; and &quot; Dances With Wolves &quot; at Orion Pictures before joining TriStar . Messer was formerly with Columbia / TriStar International . Medavoy said it ' s too soon to discuss the company ' s plans . But sources say Phoenix will be involved in areas outside film production , including foreign financing deals . The partners ' fund-raising crusade has brought them in contact with everyone from Southeast Asian investors to British conglomerates . In the United States , the company was said to be in serious discussions with super-investor Kirk Kerkorian earlier this year . Phoenix declined to comment on that report . But a spokesman for Kerkorian confirmed that the discussions took_place . Alex Yemenidjian of Kerkorian ' s Tracinda Corp . said Kerkorian has &quot; a very high regard &quot; for Medavoy but ultimately decided to invest elsewhere . &quot; To say we got very close and pulled_out ( would be ) a mischaracterization , &quot; Yemenidjian said . &quot; It sounds like we looked_at it and didn ' t like it , &quot; he said . &quot; We entered into discussions to consider it . During those discussions other things came_up . . . other investment opportunities that prevented us from going_into that transaction . We just got busy with other things. &quot; * Walt Disney Studios got_off to an early start in the Academy Awards derby Monday by sending_out a glossy brochure that promotes 13 of its films for Oscar consideration . In deference to the talent , studios usually go_to great lengths to avoid the appearance of favoring certain of their films_over others . But the number of screenings scheduled for each film offers a good indicator of where Disney stands . &quot; The Lion King , &quot; the critically acclaimed hit , has the most showings , at six . Next is &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; a bigger success with critics than with moviegoers , with five . The quirky &quot; Ed Wood &quot; gets four . And the troubled &quot; I Love Trouble &quot; has only one . * Inside Hollywood * For more Company Town coverage and insightful analysis of the entertainment_industry , sign_on to the TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; Inside Hollywood. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4 * Times staff writer Adam S .
