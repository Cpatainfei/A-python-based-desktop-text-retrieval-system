   <HEADLINE> DISPUTE OVER PIPELINE PUTS U.S. , TURKEY ON COLLISION COURSE FOR CONFRONTATION ; DIPLOMACY : ANKARA WANTS THE OIL LANGUISHING IN CONDUIT FROM IRAQ . WASHINGTON SAYS U.N. SANCTIONS FORBID IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and Turkey are heading toward a major confrontation over U.N.-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq , specifically the ban on Turkey ' s use of an oil_pipeline between Iraq and the Mediterranean . The dispute potentially threatens the cohesion of the U.S.-led coalition trying to squeeze Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power , according to U.S. and Turkish analysts . &quot; Keeping the coalition in_line is getting increasingly difficult , &quot; a leading U.S. analyst said . &quot; There are real stresses and strains. &quot; Moreover , the dispute could strain relations between the United States and a strategic North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ally . It could even jeopardize the future of the embattled Kurdish minority in Iraq . The confrontation centers_on a deal that Turkey quietly worked_out with Iraq this spring to reopen the pipeline after flushing out 12 million barrels of oil that have been sitting in it since Iraq ' s 1990 invasion of Kuwait . Turkey , in a serious recession , badly needs the revenue from the oil . In exchange for access to the oil , Turkey would send Iraq food , medicine and other humanitarian goods . The Clinton_Administration moved quickly to block the deal on the grounds that it violated U.N. sanctions . U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Richard Barkley formally protested to ranking Turkish officials , Turkish and U.S. officials said . Turkey pleaded its case on the basis of Article 50 of the U.N. Charter , which allows a third_party adversely affected by sanctions to appeal for relief . Turkey claims that sanctions have cost it $ 20 billion in lost business with Iraq since 1990 , a figure deemed high by U.S. officials . The pipeline alone has cost more_than $ 500 # 000 in annual losses for Turkey , according to Phebe Marr , a senior fellow at the National Defense University here . In the late 1980s , before sanctions , Iraq was the second largest customer for Turkish exports . In addition , the government of Turkish Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller argued that the pipeline would corrode unless it was flushed . The Clinton_Administration countered with a compromise allowing the initial flushing plus one or two others for pipeline repairs and economic relief . But at the United Nations , Britain , France and Russia demanded that the compromise include payment from the pipeline ' s revenues to the U.N. Compensation Commission that was set_up after the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War to oversee Iraqi reparations for war damage , according to Turkish sources . The sanctions allow Iraq to sell its oil to buy humanitarian goods . But 30 % of its profits must first go_to the U.N. commission , and as much as 10 % more can be taken by the United Nations to cover its operating expenses in Iraq . Of the 12 million barrels in the pipeline , 8.2 million barrels belong_to Iraq and 3.8 million barrels belong_to Turkey . Unless a compromise is worked_out , Ciller ' s government has threatened implicitly to block renewal of Operation Provide Comfort when it comes_up for review in Parliament at the end of this month . Operation Provide Comfort , which has been increasingly controversial in Turkey , where it is based , provides humanitarian aid and air protection for Kurds living_in northern Iraq . The end of Operation Provide Comfort probably would enable Hussein to reabsorb Kurdistan , which rose_up against his regime after the Persian_Gulf_War . A subsequent crackdown led nearly 2 million Kurds to flee to the borders of Iran and Turkey in 1991 -- and to the coalition ' s intervention with Provide Comfort . &quot; Solidarity is not a one-way_street , &quot; Ozdem Sanberk , Turkish undersecretary for foreign affairs , told The Times . &quot; We stood_up with the coalition and assumed a huge responsibility , which we still have . We now have a problem as a result of the embargo that needs to be addressed by our partners. &quot; Turkey ' s economic problems have begun to take a major toll . On May_Day this year , tens of thousands of workers protested the impact of the government ' s austerity program and their country ' s 100 % annual inflation . &quot; At the moment , there is an uneasiness in our Parliament and a perception that there is not sufficient care by our partners , &quot; said Sanberk , who was in Washington last week and at U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday to try to work_out a compromise . &quot; The government needs to be able to show public_opinion that the problems are being addressed. &quot; U.S. officials are playing_down the immediate dangers of a rift . &quot; Once the government looks_at the strategic trade-offs , the prime_minister will see Provide Comfort as the most important thing we ' re doing together in the post-Cold War world , &quot; a senior official said . The Clinton_Administration also thinks that a further short-term accommodation can be reached by the coalition allies . But a compromise with Turkey is unlikely to end the saga . First , Iraq still has leverage . Turkey will have to go_back there to get approval of any new formula . And in the past , Hussein ' s regime has refused to sell its oil to pay_for humanitarian goods rather than pay a percentage to the United Nations . &quot; The Iraqis are in the driver ' s seat as far as the Turks are concerned , &quot; a U.S. official said . &quot; They can say : ' This is the way we want to do_it , or we won ' t let it happen at all. ' Then the Turks have to make a tough choice. &quot; Iraq sees the Turkish deal as a means of undermining the sanctions regime and potentially breaking_up the coalition , U.S. officials say . Opening_up the Turkish front would be the beginning of the end of sanctions . But U.S. aid , which is shrinking , is not an alternative to end Turkey ' s economic woes . Since the Cold_War ' s end , aid to Turkey has been cut_back from about $ 900 million six years ago to less than $ 300 million for fiscal 1995 . Second , resolution of the immediate dispute will not solve either the broader problems that led Ciller to try to revive the pipeline or Turkey ' s fundamental new differences with the allies . Turkey has concluded that Hussein will survive sanctions , diplomatic isolation and other efforts to end his 15-year rule . Its domestic and regional policies are now based on those tenets , U.S. officials said . In contrast , U.S. policy is to continue the sanctions and politically squeeze Iraq until Hussein is ousted . If the U.N. sanctions are lifted , Washington is expected to continue a unilateral economic embargo . Turkey ' s new assessment already has led the coalition to suspect that the pipeline deal would not be a onetime arrangement . Ciller has said publicly that she intends to continue to sell oil through the pipeline . &quot; She ' s not being very cool about the way she goes_about asking_for favors , &quot; a U.S. official said . Because oil experts differ on whether the pipeline has been damaged by prolonged inactivity , U.S. analysts also suggest that Turkey ' s argument may be a pretext to set a precedent . In addition , pipelines cannot be left empty without the risk of damage . So after the flushings , it would have to be immediately filled_again -- thus creating the same situation as today , Turkish analysts say .</TEXT>
