   <HEADLINE> CAMPESINOS ' STRUGGLE OVER LAND RIGHTS IS WIDESPREAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Indian rebels who staged the New Year ' s uprising in Mexico ' s Chiapas state are far from the only group seeking redress in the country ' s impoverished and conflict-ridden south . Deep in the vast rain_forest known as the Chimalapas , between Chiapas and Oaxaca states , a protracted and sometimes violent battle over land rights has spawned a vigorous , mostly Indian peasant movement . Although the movement here has no direct link to the current rebellion farther_east , the underlying causes of discontent -- notably the regionwide inequity of land distribution -- are similar to those cited by guerrillas of Chiapas ' so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army . Here , peasant leaders are pushing a unique , nonviolent remedy : the creation of a Campesino ( Peasant ) Ecological Reserve to protect the area from Chiapas-based timber-cutters , ranchers , drug_traffickers and others who have already ravaged much of the Chimalapas and other Mexican forests . Peasant settlers claim ownership of the entire zone , based on a Zoque Indian purchase from the Spanish crown in 1687 -- a sale recognized by several Mexican presidents , most recently in 1967 . &quot; We have shown that we , as campesinos , know how to manage and preserve our forest , &quot; said Roque Antonio Guillen , a Chimalapas peasant leader . &quot; This is our home. &quot; Under the plan , the 15 # 000 or so peasants residing in the area seek formal recognition of their ownership . They have also requested military assistance to expel wood-cutters , ranchers and the drug_traffickers who have cleared stretches of forest to sow marijuana plants and opium_poppies , moving their dope via clandestine airstrips . Environmentalists have strongly backed the novel reserve concept , which has achieved a following among conservationists , human_rights activists and artists in a nation still coming_to grips with its plundered natural heritage . Many believe that the forest conceals extensive ruins of a civilization linked to the Mayas , in addition to its greatly varied flora and fauna . &quot; The peasants who live_in the forest have a real interest in preserving their land , &quot; said Homero Aridjis , a poet who heads the Group of 100 , an environmental group in Mexico_City . &quot; Too_much has been lost already. &quot; But timber , ranching and other powerful interests based in Chiapas are vehemently opposed to peasant control of the rich region , Mexico ' s largest remaining rain_forest , encompassing about 1.5 million acres ( more_than the state of Delaware ) . About 1 # 100 species of animals and plants are found here -- more_than in most nations -- including the jaguar ( the Americas ' largest cat ) , the monkey-devouring harpy_eagle ( the world ' s most powerful ) , and the garishly plumed quetzal_bird . Development , backed by powerful and sometimes violent interests , threatens the remaining stretches of rain_forest here in the heart of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , which slices between the Gulf_of_Mexico and the Pacific_Ocean . Settlers say pistoleros , or hired gunmen , have killed and kidnaped peasants , burned their homes and otherwise tried to force them out and discourage grass-roots organization and conservation . &quot; We live_in fear here , &quot; said Constantino Garcia , a 34-year-old Chinateco Indian who is mayor of this jungle clearing . &quot; But we ' re not giving in. &quot; The heated dispute is illustrative of the bitter conflicts that have long pitted mostly rural Indian inhabitants of southern Mexico against wealthy landed interests of predominantly European and mixed-race origins . Violent land clashes and forced expulsions of peasants are entwined in the region ' s dense fabric . Here , human_rights activists say , it is as though the bloody Mexican_Revolution -- fought largely to guarantee land and equal rights for dispossessed campesinos -- never took_place . Land conflicts are particularly chronic in Chiapas state , which is often said to be more akin to neighboring Guatemala -- with its huge indigenous population and stark concentration of wealth among a mostly white elite -- than to industrialized northern and central Mexico . &quot; Anyone visiting Chiapas must feel as though they ' ve traveled back in time , &quot; Bishop Samuel Ruiz , the activist Roman_Catholic prelate of San Cristobal de las Casas , said in a recent interview . Leading the opposition to the peasant-reserve effort is Chiapas ' most powerful son : Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido , the former Chiapas governor who now sits as Cabinet-level secretary of government , in_charge of the nation ' s internal security . The former governor dismisses the peasant plan as a land-grab by Oaxacans . ( In a long-running dispute , Oaxaca and Chiapas officials both claim the southeastern third of the Chimalapas region. ) Gonzalez is equally suspicious of the communal land claims , questioning the validity of the Indians ' colonial-era acquisition . While critics call Gonzalez a guardian for loggers and ranchers , he describes himself as a rain_forest champion . He takes credit for halting the destruction of the Lacandon rain_forest farther south , now officially protected but already largely denuded by development . &quot; We cannot allow to occur in the Chimalapas what happened in Amazonia , what happened in the Lacandon , &quot; Gonzalez said in a recent interview . Gonzalez favors a conventional protective scheme : the creation of a Chimalapas ecological reserve , operated by the federal_government . &quot; Authorities cannot abdicate their responsibilities , &quot; he said . But conservationists and peasants point_out that the plunder of Mexico ' s natural_resources has seldom abated because of officially protected status . Although the peasant reserve notion only surfaced two years ago , grass-roots activism here dates_back more_than two decades . Indeed , in 1986 villagers detained the brother of the then-governor of Chiapas , who was accused of illegally cutting wood and growing coffee on communal land . ( Over the weekend , the Chiapas rebels reportedly seized the former governor himself , Absalon Castellanos , a former army general , from his ranch. ) Here in San Francisco la Paz , a quiet riverside hamlet of 400 named after a saint of peace , an incongruous aura of fear hovers above the tidy village of thatched-roof huts at the edge of the towering forest canopy . Villagers say hired gunmen from neighboring Chiapas often threaten inhabitants , who overwhelmingly back the peasant reserve plan . &quot; They want to force us all out and be free to cut_down the forest , &quot; said Angela Mendez , a beleaguered mother of seven . Her late husband founded the settlement in 1960 after walking eight days through the jungle . One of her sons , Sigilfredo Escobedo , 39 , says he narrowly survived an attack by a knife-wielding intruder who broke_into his home on a recent evening . Another son , Baldemar Escobedo , a 33-year-old father of three , was kidnaped and &quot; disappeared &quot; along a forest path last year . Across the rushing Rio Uxpanapa , in the settlement of San Pedro Buena Vista , Andres Gomez Castellano says his wife and two young children disappeared in July , 1992 , while walking along a jungle path . Searchers found their bodies two days later ; they had been beaten to death , he said . He suspects that the slayings , to date unsolved , were acts of retribution for inhabitants ' support of the reserve plan . Ironically , Gomez and about 40 other Tzotzil Indian families came_to the jungle four years ago seeking a respite after being evicted from their ancestral homes_in the village of San Juan Chamula , in the cool pine forests of southern Chiapas . Like thousands of others , they were expelled in a religious dispute after converting to a Protestant sect from their Catholic faith . &quot; We came looking_for land and a place where we would n ' t be persecuted , &quot; Gomez said . &quot; But now our new village is stained by blood. &quot;</TEXT>
