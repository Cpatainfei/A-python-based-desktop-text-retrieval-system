   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN OFFICIALS INSIST ECONOMY IS STABILIZING ; SUMMIT : GROUP OF SEVEN FINANCIAL LEADERS ARE SKEPTICAL . BUT THEY ' RE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT EUROPE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Meeting with financial leaders from the world ' s biggest industrial democracies , Russia ' s economic policy-makers Saturday insisted that they are committed to reforms and have policies that can stabilize the country ' s runaway inflation . However , the finance_ministers and central bankers from the so-called Group of Seven who heard the Russians ' presentation voiced skepticism that the ambitious goals can be met . Earlier in the day , the G-7 ministers gave a cautiously optimistic projection that Europe may soon follow the United States out of one of the worst recessions since World_War_II . Also , at a separate , bilateral meeting , U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Japanese Finance_Minister Hirohisa Fujii talked for about an hour but failed to make any headway in resolving the issues that have led to a major trade dispute between their two nations . But the main focus of Saturday ' s G-7 meeting was_on the Russian reform process and the obstacles that threaten it in the wake of last December ' s parliamentary elections -- elections that saw proponents of a free-market economy trounced by ultranationalists and former Communists . In a narrow sense , Saturday ' s meeting was about world lending agencies releasing more of the $ 44-billion Russian aid package approved by the Group of Seven heads of government last year in Tokyo . That assistance is linked to progress both in reforming Russia ' s huge , obsolete , state-owned industrial sector and in stabilizing key economic factors such_as dangerously high inflation and growing budget_deficits . In the larger context , the very future of Russia itself and , with it , the stability and security of the West depend in part on the ability of the major industrial democracies and key international lending_institutions to work with Moscow to nurture reform yet avoid political explosion . During a two-hour meeting held at a large villa in the Taunus Mountains north of Frankfurt , the three key figures in control of Russia ' s economic future -- Finance_Minister Sergei Dubinin , Deputy Prime_Minister Alexander N . Shokhin and the chairman of the Russian Central_Bank , Viktor V . Gerashchenko -- told the G-7 ministers and central bankers that the present government will be able to limit the federal budget_deficit to 5 % of gross_domestic_product this year and cut inflation from the present rate of about 23 % a month to less than 10 % . &quot; We ' re sure that by the end of the year , inflation will be below 10 % per month ( and ) a more realistic figure would be 7 % to 9 % , &quot; Dubinin told reporters after the meeting . He and Shokhin did , however , refer to &quot; a difficult political situation &quot; in Moscow . With many of Russia ' s radical reformers swept from power , some respected Western economists have predicted just the opposite -- a slide into hyper-inflation as the pressure for change stalls . While the G-7 representatives urged the Russians to press forward with reforms launched prior to last December ' s parliamentary elections , they were clearly unconvinced by the assurances they received Saturday . &quot; I think , considering where they are now , that ' s an ambitious goal , &quot; Bentsen said after the meeting , shaking his head skeptically as he spoke . &quot; They ' ve got some tough judgments to arrive at. &quot; German Bundesbank Chairman Hans Tietmeyer said he was encouraged by the presentation but remained unsure if the goals can be met . &quot; We got the impression they are trying , but the question is if the political structures will allow them to succeed , &quot; he said . In a formal statement , the G-7 representatives also : * Tried to nudge the International Monetary Fund and the Russian government to work more closely to improve the flow of aid . Harvard_University economist Jeffrey Sachs , who played an important role in formulating initial post-Communist economic reforms in Poland , said recently that of the $ 17 billion in loans pledged to Russia last year via the International Monetary Fund and the World_Bank , only $ 2 billion had been dispensed . &quot; The IMF failed miserably in advising the Group of Seven countries and the Yeltsin administration on Russia ' s financial reconstruction , &quot; Sachs wrote last month in the New York Times . * Agreed to support a new , substantial debt-rescheduling agreement for Russia but emphasized the need for Moscow to meet all remaining debt obligations . * Noted that enhanced trade access for Russian manufactured goods abroad is an essential part of the G-7 ' s reform strategy . Earlier this month , Shokhin accused the West of building what he called a new Iron_Curtain around Russia by refusing to purchase Russian goods . The G-7 ministers were also cautiously upbeat about the global economy , indicating that one of the worst recessions since World_War_II has most likely reached its ebb . &quot; There was overall agreement that the worst of the recession . . . is now over and that in some areas , recovery is under way , &quot; commented German Finance Ministry spokesman Christian Kastrop . The assessment was based largely on renewed growth in the United States , hopes for a Japanese stimulus package and German government estimates that the downturn in Europe ' s largest , bellwether economy has ended . German Finance_Minister Theo Waigel told the meeting that the German economy will return to growth this year , with unemployment peaking at its present postwar high of just over 4 million and total gross_domestic_product expected to rise by as much as 1.5 % . At the same time , he said , Germany ' s inflation_rate will most likely drop from its present 3.4 % level to below 3 % by the end of the year . While some independent analysts have accused the German government of overly optimistic forecasts to boost its image in a crucial election year , Waigel strenuously defended his projections . The IMF also urged Japan , in the throes of its own deep recession , to extend a $ 145-billion fiscal stimulus package beyond the present year and pressed Tokyo to open its domestic markets more to foreign goods . A senior U.S. Treasury_Department official said nothing resembling a breakthrough came during the hourlong Bentsen-Fujii meeting . He said Japan &quot; gave no indication &quot; that it is ready to move_on its trade impasse with the United States . That dispute is fueled largely by the continued difficulties encountered by American companies trying to penetrate Japanese markets and by a U.S. trade_deficit with Japan that last year hit $ 60 billion .</TEXT>
