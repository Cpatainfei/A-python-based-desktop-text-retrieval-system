   <HEADLINE> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY : A NEW WAVE OF CELEBRATION FOR SOME OLD_MEN OF THE SEA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ANCHORS AWEIGH ! : The restored World_War_II cargo_ship Lane Victory and its crew of senior-citizen ex-merchant seamen didn ' t quite make_it to Europe for the D-day 50th anniversary . But next month , if all goes well , the 455-foot freighter will once again head out_to sea . The occasion is the scheduled triumphant return of another old oceanic codger , the WWII Liberty_ship Jeremiah O ' Brien , which made the 9 # 000-mile D-day anniversary voyage and is heading back to its home port of San Francisco . The Lane Victory crew , all members of the U.S. Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II , plans to take the ship into San Francisco Bay with the O ' Brien about Sept . 23 and tie_up there for a_few days before returning to San Pedro . Engine problems aborted the Lane Victory ' s D-day voyage in May after only five days at_sea , but they have now been repaired , says Jerry Turner of the merchant_marine veterans . After the San Francisco trip , Turner says , the Lane Victory will be moving to its new quarters at Berth 94 in San Pedro , near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum . * NUMBERS PLEASE : El Segundo Mayor Carl Jacobson says he would be glad to turn_over records for his city-owned cellular_phone to former City Councilman Scot Dannen . After all , Jacobson says , he has nothing to hide -- no calls to a bookie or a sex line . Unfortunately , he says , city officials won ' t let him . &quot; I would be happy to release them , if I had them , &quot; Jacobson says of the phone records . &quot; But I ' ve never had physical possession of them . . . . But I can tell you I use ( the phone ) strictly for city business. &quot; Jacobson said the itemized bills for his phone have averaged $ 5 to $ 10 per month , and never more_than $ 22 . City_Manager James W . Morrison says the mayor and other city officials need cellular_phones in case of an emergency . The controversy started three months ago , Dannen says , when he wondered why the mayor of a one-square-mile city needed a city-issued cellular_phone . He asked_for copies of the phone_bills , which he got , but city officials refused to turn_over the itemized list of calls made and received on the mayor ' s cellular_phone . They cited a court ruling that said releasing such phone_numbers could violate the privacy of callers . Still , Dannen says , he doesn ' t intend to give_up . &quot; I ' m going_to ask him again who he ' s been calling , &quot; he says . &quot; I just want to know. &quot; * A ROYAL STINK : If you noticed a stench coming from Manhattan Beach last weekend , don ' t be alarmed . It was for a good cause . Nearly 50 men from the South Bay competed Saturday in the fifth Annual Old Smelly Jocks Sports Tournament , a 12-hour test of endurance and athletic prowess . Competitors , who raised $ 300 for a Hollywood orphanage , played three-on-three basketball , three-on-three volleyball , over-the-line baseball and Ultimate Frisbee . As it turns_out , the aging jocks weren ' t as fit as they thought , says Bob Makela , 33 , of Manhattan Beach , who organized the annual tournament five years ago . &quot; Guys were hunched_over walking_around afterward . There were a lot of aching muscles. &quot; But in the end , Gary Ceregioli , 31 , of Manhattan Beach smelled victory when he won the most games and was crowned King of the Old Smelly Jocks . QUOTE OF THE WEEK &quot; If God could grant me all_of my wishes , I would wish he ' d give me the ability to make a difference in a place like Inglewood . I am a child of a place like Inglewood. &quot; -- McKinley Nash , the new superintendent of the Inglewood Unified School District .</TEXT>
