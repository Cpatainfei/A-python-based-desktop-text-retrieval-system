   <HEADLINE> CLOTHING LINE WINS BACKERS AND WEARERS ; PLACENTIA FIRM ' S SPORTSWEAR CARRIES SLOGANS OF LATINO PRIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sportswear maker Mike Rodriguez finessed his way past security at last year ' s Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona to press a T-shirt and hat emblazoned with his Mojado Brothers company logo on comedian Paul Rodriguez . &quot; At first , I thought ' Who are you calling mojado ? ' I felt insulted , &quot; said the Latino comedian and actor in describing his reaction to the term , whose literal translation is wet , but also means the pejorative &quot; wetback &quot; in Spanish slang . &quot; Then I thought_about it and I said ' Hey , that ' s cool , ' &quot; Paul Rodriguez said . Cool enough for him to pledge a $ 50 # 000 investment and help enlist other Latino celebrities to endorse the company founded nearly three years ago by Mike Rodriguez and Dan Calderon , both Mexican Americans who grew_up in Southern California . Rodriguez , who has been a silk screener and graphic designer in the garment industry for many years , teamed_up with Calderon , who has a background in banking , to create a sportswear line specifically targeting Latino youth . In designing their clothes , the two took inspiration from the baggy pants , long shorts and loose fitting T-shirts favored by urban teens . The founders also said they wanted to send a positive message about Latino identity and the commonality of Americans . They chose the term mojado , they explained , to &quot; take the venom &quot; out of a term that has long been an insult to Mexican Americans and immigrants from Latin_America . &quot; Everybody had to cross some body_of_water to get here , &quot; said Calderon . &quot; We are all mojado . &quot; But the provocative company_name threatened to kill the young firm before it could even begin to reach its targeted market . The term mojado sometimes only appears on merchandise labels , but it is boldly incorporated into the design of many of the company ' s shirts and hats . J.C. Penney and Salt Lake City-based ZCMI department_stores were among the first retailers to place orders , but they pulled thousands of the company ' s T-shirts from their racks when Latino employees and shoppers complained about the label . Just a_few months ago , offended Latino dock_workers at Mervyn ' s refused to unload a delivery of Mojado Brothers T-shirts . &quot; We ' ve had a hard_time overcoming the expression mojado , &quot; said Saul Grossman , whose Los Angeles-based Trans Color Co . distributes the Mojado Brothers line . &quot; The artwork and concept have been very well accepted . The ( store ) buyers get hooked , but then they run away. &quot; Grossman and buyers for many stores , including Mervyn ' s , J.C. Penney and the Broadway , have urged the young company to modify its label so that it will not offend . &quot; Mo Bros &quot; is the most common suggestion . Why ignore the industry wisdom ? The partners &quot; don ' t want to sell_out like that . We like the provocativeness of mojado . We want the word to get people to think_about what they ' re saying , &quot; Paul Rodriguez explained . But a string of canceled orders forced the partners to realize they needed a strategy to persuade retailers that the merchandise was not too hot to handle . They believed that they would have a wedge to get_into stores if they could get Latino celebrities to wear their clothes and build a following among young Latinos . With Paul Rodriguez ' s help , they got their clothes on the backs of Latinos such_as musician Carlos Santana , members of the pop_music group Los Lobos , actors Edward James Olmos and Jimmy Smits , boxer Jorge Paez ( who razor-cut the Mojado Brothers logo into his hair for a fight ) and comedian Cheech Marin . Among non-Latinos , comedian George Carlin has worn the shirts , and even O.J. Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro has given news_conferences wearing a Mojado Brothers baseball_cap . The strategy has had some success . In a crucial test for the company , the Broadway has accepted an order of 2 # 000 T-shirts for 13 of its stores catering primarily to Latino customers . Broadway buyer Danny Kim said the retailer was willing to take_a_chance on the line only after its own research concluded that the label would not offend Latino shoppers . The Broadway also asked that a tag explaining the Mojado Brothers ' creed -- supporting education , racial harmony and &quot; positive change &quot; -- accompany each shirt . &quot; We were concerned about people not understanding , &quot; Kim said . &quot; We want to make_sure customers know it ' s a Hispanic-owned company . We didn ' t want the T-shirt out there without some explanation. &quot; Kim said the Broadway decided to make an extra effort for the line because it believes the company ' s sportswear has potential . &quot; We think it ' s a pretty unique concept in department_store mentality where everything is usually done for the majority . &quot; Basically , there have not been a lot of things targeted specifically for the Hispanic community . We carry ethnically influenced stuff , but nothing specifically done_by an Hispanic company geared for the Hispanic customer , &quot; Kim said . When the company was formed , Mike Rodriguez was the partner with experience in the garment industry . He already owned Soft Touch , a Placentia silk-screening plant that did contract work for other garment makers . The plant is now also the Mojado Brothers production facility . Mike Rodriguez serves as the company ' s creative force and Calderon looks_after legal and financial issues . A fourth partner , Samm Pena , who had also been a partner with Paul Rodriguez in entertainment ventures , handles media and marketing for Mojado Brothers . Mike Rodriguez designs the T-shirts , which blend street-inspired designs with motifs borrowed from pre-Columbian and African folk_art . The images have inspired distributors to coin a new marketing category specifically for the firm ' s line : Southwestern Surf . All the shirts carry slogans of ethnic pride , peaceful coexistence or other messages of social responsibility . Among the nine Mojado Brothers designs accepted by the Broadway is a shirt that features two skeletons asking each other , &quot; What color were you ? &quot; Mojado Brothers has 22 designs in total . Trans Color ' s Grossman is hopeful that the company has won some converts to its point_of_view . &quot; This could become a Cross Colours , &quot; said Grossman , referring to the rapid rise of the street-oriented African American-owned clothing company that made multimillion-dollar profits before running_into financial difficulties last year . The Mojado Brothers line is &quot; an item whose time and concept have come . . . catering to a community that hasn ' t been catered to before , &quot; Grossman said . To strengthen grass-roots support , the firm is now promoting its merchandise with a nine-city comedy tour of the Southwest , including a show scheduled for Los Angeles next month . The tour , starring Latino comics , including Rene Sandoval , began in El Paso two weeks ago , playing to a sold-out audience , according to Mike Rodriguez . ( Paul Rodriguez is expected to perform at some of the shows. ) According to Mike Rodriguez , vendors at the El Paso show sold more_than 500 Mojado Brothers T-shirts in one night . Many people asked how they could get the tour jackets and caps they saw on the comics , he said . Because of such enthusiastic response , the partners say they believe there is a market for a line of jackets , sweat shirts , shorts and jeans already designed by Mike Rodriguez .</TEXT>
