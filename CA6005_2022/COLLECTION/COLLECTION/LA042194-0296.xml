   <HEADLINE> CELLULOID HERO ; HIS SMOOTH JUMPER CAPTURES THE MOMENT IN ' HOOSIERS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I ' ll make it. &quot; -- Jimmy Chitwood , &quot; Hoosiers &quot; Jerry Dawson has officiated dozens of recreation league basketball_games at the small Salvation_Army gym on Edinger Avenue . But something was bothering Dawson on this April evening , something he couldn ' t quite place . Maris Valainis stood_out among the 10 guys playing in the 6-feet-4-and-under league game that night . Dawson recognized that jump_shot , the one so perfect it should be cast in gold and sitting atop a trophy . Ever seen the movie , &quot; Hoosiers , &quot; Jerry ? &quot; that ' s who he is ? &quot; Dawson asked . &quot; He ' s Jimmy Chitwood ? I thought I ' ve seen that jump_shot somewhere before. &quot; It ' s hard to forget it if you saw the 1986 movie ' s final scene , where Chitwood hit the game-winning jump_shot for tiny Hickory High_School in the 1952 Indiana State High_School championship basketball_game . Same jump_shot . Same player . But not the same person . &quot; A lot of people walk up_to me after I play , and they ' ll say , ' Hey , you look_like that guy from ' Hoosiers , ' &quot; Valainis said . &quot; If I ' m playing well , I ' ll tell them it was me . If I ' m not playing well , I tell them it ' s not me. &quot; In the movie , Chitwood hit the winning shot that no doubt propelled him to glory . In reality , Valainis was cut four times from his high_school team in Indianapolis , played golf for a year at Purdue and dropped_out as a junior to pursue an acting career that landed him roles that included an ax murderer in a TV series . Eight years after his first and biggest role , Valainis , 31 , works as a golf_pro in Mission Viejo and wants nothing to do with the Hollywood scene . And he ' s quite content with playing hoops in a small , dark gym much like the one the Hollywood casting agent discovered him in back in 1985 . But some things never change . Valainis is among the rec league ' s scoring leaders , averaging 18 points . His team is in first place . Valainis made his acting debut in one of the best sports movies of all time . Filmed on a $ 7.7-million budget , &quot; Hoosiers &quot; has grossed $ 30 million on the big screen , with millions more in video rentals and sales . The movie has become a cult favorite with basketball junkies , players and coaches , who show it to motivate their high_school and college players . It inspired Duke center Cherokee Parks , who watched it shortly before his Marina High team played for the 1991 Southern Section I-A championship . Parks shouted , &quot; Hickory ! &quot; through an empty L.A. Sports Arena , just as one of the Hickory players had done before the big_game . &quot; It ' s amazing , &quot; Valainis said . &quot; I never realized what a motivational thing this movie has become . It ' s great that after eight years , people still rent it and like it . &quot; It ' s a little like the ' Wizard of Oz ' in that it ' s set_back in another era but is enjoyed today and will be 40 years from now. &quot; &quot; Hoosiers &quot; is loosely based on the story of tiny Milan High_School , which upset powerhouse Muncie Central in the 1954 Indiana state tournament final . The movie was written by Angelo Pizzo and directed by David Anspaugh , both Indiana natives . It ' s the story of Norman Dale ( Gene Hackman ) , a temperamental former college coach haunted by memories of punching a player several years before . Hickory , a small_town that isn ' t used to change , doesn ' t exactly put_out the welcome_mat for its new , volatile coach . The school ' s vice principal ( Barbara Hershey ) keeps Chitwood , his best player , off the team , encouraging him to pursue an academic scholarship , rather than an athletic one . As losses pile_up , the townspeople grow tired_of Dale ' s sideline temper . And the fact that he has turned the town drunk ( Dennis Hopper ) into an assistant coach hasn ' t helped , either . At a meeting , the townspeople voted to fire the coach . Enter Chitwood . It seems he has been watching Dale in games and practices and likes what he sees . Chitwood announces : &quot; If I play , coach stays . He goes , I go. &quot; The coach stays , Chitwood plays , and Hickory goes undefeated the rest of the way . And for Valainis , it was the basketball championship he never got a chance to play for in high_school . Valainis grew_up in Indianapolis , the sixth of seven children . Like most kids in Indiana , he wanted to someday play for the Hoosiers . &quot; I was a big IU fan , &quot; he said . &quot; My brother was going there in 1975-76 , when they had the undefeated team . Every night they played , I would watch it on Channel 4 -- Kent Benson , Scott May , Quinn Buckner . It was a great team. &quot; Besides playing basketball , Valainis also found time to hit golf_balls at a local course . By 9 , he was working as a caddie along with his five brothers , and his swing developed must faster than his jump_shot . Always small for his age , Valainis played_on youth basketball_teams through the eighth grade . He always shot from his hip because he wasn ' t strong enough to shoot a conventional jumper . &quot; I was only 5 feet 6 by my freshman year , &quot; he said . &quot; And I wasn ' t very good . &quot; I wanted to make the freshman team very badly , so I practiced my shooting every day that summer . That was all I worked_on . Finally , I got the ball_up over my head when I shot. &quot; Still , Valainis was cut during his freshman year at Chatard High , a Catholic_school of about 800 students . He was cut as sophomore and junior , too . Too short and too slow , he said . &quot; I finally grew to 6-1 by my senior year , &quot; said Valainis , now 6-2 . &quot; But by then , the coach had his team. &quot; While he struggled in basketball , Valainis made Chatard ' s varsity golf team by his sophomore year and played_on three city champions . After graduating in 1981 , he joined Purdue ' s golf team as a walk-on , playing only one season before quitting to concentrate_on his mechanical_engineering studies . His college career came_to an end early in 1986 when a casting director for Hoosiers walked into an elementary_school gym and spotted Valainis draining jump_shots from all_over the court . &quot; This guy walked up_to me and asked me if I wanted to try_out for a basketball movie , &quot; Valainis said . He showed_up the next day and was greeted by a line of 400 people outside the gym . Get_in line , superstar . &quot; It was nuts , &quot; he said . &quot; I couldn ' t wait around four hours . I had a job painting houses , and I had to get_to work. &quot; But just as Valainis began to leave , the casting director emerged from the gym . &quot; He brought me right in , &quot; Valainis said . &quot; They ( casting crew_members ) had me dribble and shoot_for a while , then they invited me back to audition a week later. &quot; Valainis had no acting experience , not even a credit in a school play . But his audition , basketball skills and his dark , thin features caught the director ' s eye . &quot; I was really nervous for the audition , &quot; he said . &quot; A local TV crew was there filming some of the auditions , and thank God they filmed the guy before me instead of me . I would have been so nervous , I would n ' t have made it. &quot; Valainis made_it , and so did a handful of other actors who portrayed Hickory players . Most of them were unknowns . Most grew_up in Indiana , and all but one , Valainis , played high_school basketball . They practiced together two weeks before filming started in October in Knightstown , Ind. , just outside Indianapolis . They installed a_few plays to run during the basketball scenes . Hackman arrived early to help the rookies polish their acting skills . Filming lasted 10 weeks , all_of it done on location in Indiana . Days were long , and sometimes tempers flared . On one particularly frustrating day , Hackman announced to anyone within earshot that the movie would become another &quot; Heaven ' s Gate , &quot; considered one of the biggest box-office bombs of all time . &quot; We figured if anybody would know , it would be him , &quot; Valainis said . &quot; We were sort of surprised by all_the success the movie has had. &quot; Many of the younger actors hung_out with Hopper , who told them stories about his early days on the set of &quot; Rebel Without a Cause &quot; with James Dean . To kill time between filming , the players organized free-throw shooting contests and played cards . &quot; It was pretty laid back , &quot; Valainis said . The championship game was filmed at Hinkle Fieldhouse on the Butler University campus . Strangely enough , it was filmed at halftime of a high_school game involving Chatard , Valainis ' alma_mater . &quot; The Chatard coach came_over and said ' Hi , ' &quot; Valainis said , smiling . The final game scene was one of the toughest to film . The players were exhausted from filming so many basketball scenes . Fans had to be moved to different sections of the arena to make the crowd seem bigger . And Valainis ' winning jump_shot had to be perfect . It certainly wasn ' t during rehearsal , when he missed jumper after jumper . &quot; I couldn ' t hit the side of a barn , &quot; he said . An impatient Hackman suggested he move closer to the basket . No need . Valainis did just what Jimmy Chitwood told his coach he would do : &quot; I ' ll make it. &quot; He drilled the shot on the first take . Cut . Print it . &quot; After I hit the shot , the crowd was supposed to charge on the court , &quot; he said . &quot; During practice , somebody noticed I wasn ' t focusing_on the basket because I was distracted by the crowd. &quot; Valainis ' winning shot brought a smile to Bobby Plump , the 57-year-old Indianapolis insurance_agent who hit the winning shot for Milan in the 1954 title game . Before filming the final scenes , Valainis studied game films of Plump ' s winning basket . &quot; Maris did a wonderful job as Jimmy Chitwood , &quot; he said . &quot; I know a lot of people in Milan were disappointed when the movie came_out , because they didn ' t use the town ' s name or the school ' s name . But I thought it was a fantastic film , and Maris was terrific for a guy who had no acting experience. &quot; Valainis has never watched the entire film at once . He was too uncomfortable watching himself . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; he said , &quot; it ' s just funny to look_at , to see yourself on screen . It ' s an ego thing . I ' ve become more and more comfortable with it now. &quot; Valainis missed the premiere of &quot; Hoosiers &quot; in Indianapolis . He moved to Southern California three weeks after filming ended and was &quot; too paranoid &quot; to miss scheduled movie auditions to attend the premiere . &quot; I was only 23 at the time , and I wanted to give acting a try , &quot; he said . &quot; I figured I was young enough to come_back and get my degree. &quot; He stayed with his sister in Palos Verdes and managed a local golf_course to pay the bills . He got an agent , who helped him land a handful of small TV and movie roles , including : -- A role as a Russian student in &quot; Combat High , &quot; a TV comedy about a military school , made in the spirit of the &quot; Police_Academy &quot; movies . -- An ax murderer in one episode of a short-lived TV series called &quot; Private Eye. &quot; -- A spot playing basketball in a soft_drink commercial that aired in the Midwest . -- A brief appearance as a soldier in &quot; Casualties of War &quot; with Sean Penn and Michael J . Fox . Valainis ' character was blown_up in one of the early war scenes . &quot; I got_to go_to Thailand for that one , &quot; he said . &quot; I was there five weeks . Then I was laying by the hotel pool one day , and the assistant director came_by and said , ' that ' s it . You ' re finished. ' &quot; Valainis took him literally . It was his last movie role , although he has dabbled_in a_few stage productions in Los Angeles . He also auditioned for Woody Harrelson ' s role in &quot; White_Men can ' t Jump. &quot; Will he ever give acting another shot ? &quot; I doubt it , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s too_much rejection . You get your hopes up for a role , then you don ' t get_it . I ' m happy with what I ' m doing now. &quot; Valainis moved to Costa Mesa in 1992 and has been the head pro and assistant manager at Casta del Sol Golf_Course in Mission Viejo for the past year . He plays hoops in a couple leagues , spends time with his girlfriend and plays golf all day . It ' s not Hollywood , but it ' s a heck of a good time . So we know what happened to Valainis , but what became of his character , Jimmy Chitwood ? &quot; Hoosiers &quot; ends with the team celebrating the victory , so are we to assume that his character , Chitwood , landed a scholarship and went_on to star in college ? Valainis grins . &quot; Yeah , &quot; he said , &quot; he went_to college . &quot; Then he dropped_out to become a movie star. &quot;</TEXT>
