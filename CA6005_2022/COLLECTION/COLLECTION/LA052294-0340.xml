   <TEXT> Between 1965 and 1971 , five healthy babies were born here to a poor woman who seemed to want them desperately and who mourned each of their deaths with a convulsive grief that quavered the soul . At one funeral , Waneta Hoyt fainted after the lowering of the tiny , pitiful coffin and at another , her body collapsed with the great force of her sobbing . She had to be helped away from the freshly turned soil at the graveside . These family tragedies , one after another , puzzled friends and relatives as well as the doctors . The deaths were always sudden , the causes inexplicable . The final two babies spent most of their short lives in a Syracuse hospital , their every breath monitored by machines . On occasion , they suffered slightly abnormal pauses in respiration . Then , like matchsticks lit against an unforgiving wind , they each died within a day after being sent home . As a medical case_history , this haunting clockwork of mortality seemed a significant tale to share . One of the hospital ' s attending physicians , Dr. Alfred Steinschneider , wrote it up for the noted journal Pediatrics . He went_on to become a national expert on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome . That 1972 article was seen as pioneering work . Pediatricians often cited it as evidence that the unexplained phenomenon of SIDS may well run in families . Those abnormal pauses in breathing could be foretellers of a sudden_death . If so , SIDS was possibly preventable with the use of monitoring devices at_home . Those conclusions aside , there was also a second , starkly contrary view of Steinschneider ' s report . Some doctors thought it naive . SIDS cases were too often indistinguishable from smothering . To them , the repeating catastrophes of this woebegone family read like the relentless clues_in a murder mystery . It was an arcane , scholarly conflict , easing into obscurity over the years . But time on occasion has a remarkable way of turning backflips , the present reaching into the past . That is what has happened here . A chance remark to a young prosecutor made him look_up the old article and he also began to wonder : Were there awful secrets afloat in a grieving mother ' s tears ? Two months ago , 23 years after the death of her fifth baby , Waneta Hoyt was interrogated by police for the first time . Questioning went_on for almost two hours before something gave_way . The mother then began to confess the details of five suffocations , by pillows , with a towel , against the soft flesh of her shoulder : &quot; I could not stand the crying , &quot; she told police . &quot; It was the thing that caused me to kill them all , because I didn ' t know what to do for them. &quot; And , for a while , that appeared to be that . Waneta Hoyt -- 47 , housewife , churchgoer , the mother of an adopted boy now in high_school -- was arrested . It added yet another to a peculiar string of cases , women accused of murdering their babies , the deaths often first thought to be SIDS . But now , through her two court-appointed attorneys , Hoyt has recanted . They say their frail , emotionally scarred client would have admitted to anything that day merely to end the long cross-fire of painful questions . Certainly , that is what her many friends here in Upstate New York choose to believe . Memories are vivid of Waneta making her visits to the graves , laying crocuses near the headstones , pining to give_birth to yet another child . Life may be complicated , they acknowledge , and the human mind is capable of who knows what . But , really now , could that woman love her babies so_much and then kill them ? * Waneta Hoyt was born in nearby Richford , N.Y. , the same birthplace as John D . Rockefeller , himself a pauper who left the town as a boy and went_on to become the wealthiest_man in the world . He would return from time to time and hand_out shiny dimes in front of the general_store from his chauffeured car . In Rockefeller ' s time , a century ago , this was a poor , if picturesque , part of America . These days , good jobs are still scarce in the northern reaches of Appalachia . Tim Hoyt , Waneta ' s husband for the last 30 years , has had trouble finding construction work and is a Pinkerton guard at Cornell University , 30 miles away through the dairy_farms and hilly stands of hemlock . Here in Newark Valley , population 1 # 190 , the Hoyts live_in a weather-beaten house along a two-lane highway . Many people not only leave their front_doors unlocked , some can ' t even recall if they have a key . At the United Methodist_Church up the road , Waneta is known for her generous nature , the craftsmanship of her crocheted afghans and a long , mind-boggling run of heartache . Her own health is a continuing ordeal . Waneta has a heart_murmur and is bent over from arthritis . High-blood pressure and diabetes have weakened her eyesight . Breathing is a labor . Her bones are brittle from osteoporosis . Family troubles add_to the strain . One of Waneta ' s brothers is disabled from a hip degeneration . Another has cancer . One sister suffers from a brain_tumor . Another , immobile from the waist down , is married to Tim ' s brother , who has multiple_sclerosis . In 1989 , Waneta ' s mother died in an auto accident . &quot; There isn ' t a well person in the family , &quot; said Art Hilliard , a friend of the Hoyts since their childhoods . &quot; It has just been one trauma after another. &quot; Of course , nothing has been harder to endure than the loss of the babies . Erik died at 3 months , Julie at only 7 weeks , James at 28 months ( thought to have choked after eating breakfast ) . Those were impossible times for the Hoyts . &quot; They ' d be leaning_on each other , crying , trying to be strong for each other , &quot; recalled Hilliard ' s wife , Natalie . Around town , the common sentiments were ones of sympathy , not suspicion . An autopsy was performed on only one of the three children ; it was inconclusive . The Hoyts simply seemed to be an impossibly star-crossed couple . They lamented as much themselves . Something haywire must be deep-set within their babies , they told friends . The Hilliards and the Hoyts would play canasta late into the night , trying to keep their minds from morbid thoughts . When Molly was born , and then again with Noah , the Hoyts sought help from the best doctors around , at Upstate Medical_Center in Syracuse , nearly two hours away . Dr. Steinschneider was there . He already had an emerging interest in the phenomenon that most people called &quot; crib_death &quot; and doctors recently had named the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome . As a medical term , SIDS is certainly an unusual one . Rather than a cause of death , it is actually the absence of any detectable cause after an autopsy and investigation : a catchall for the unexplained . Each year , about 7 # 000 deaths in the United States are categorized as SIDS . Devastated parents find the term something to cling_to , better than the maddening &quot; cause unknown. &quot; Steinschneider ' s paper , and similar work by others , gave doctors something to latch onto as well . Maybe some babies in jeopardy could be identified -- and the fatal attack prevented . &quot; It was a happier scenario , &quot; Steinschneider recently recalled . &quot; I think that ' s why it had such a major impact. &quot; But the facts in the article , merely striking to some , were incredible to others . The journal printed a letter from a doctor who raised the_matter of child_abuse . The babies should have been put_in foster care rather than sent home , the writer said : &quot; Perhaps the outcome would have been different ? &quot; In his reply , Steinschneider agreed that child_abuse must always be considered in SIDS cases . But , in this instance , both he and the nurses had found the babies ' parents to be warm and supportive people . He had this to add about the couple he identified only as Mr. and Mrs . H. : &quot; Both parents often would be found sitting_by the crib and had to be urged to make physical contact with the baby . It was my impression that they feared becoming too attached emotionally . . . because they anticipated a tragic outcome . &quot; Mrs . H . expressed , on a number of occasions , considerable guilt over the death of her children , and , because of the inability of physicians to define the cause of death , felt there must be something she did or failed to do that was responsible . Following the death of the fifth infant , Mrs . H . did seek and receive outpatient psychiatric care. &quot; * One skeptic of the 1972 article was Dr. Linda Norton of Dallas , a forensic pathologist prone to complaining about the medical Establishment . In lectures , she sometimes singled_out the Steinschneider report for particular scorn . Norton does a lot of consulting . In 1986 , she found herself in Syracuse , working_on a case where a father had murdered his three young children . The assistant district_attorney was William Fitzpatrick , an aggressive , steely prosecutor from Brooklyn . He thought the crime extraordinary . Hell , Norton told him , you may have the same kind of trouble &quot; right in your own back yard , and that case is famous . You can look it up. &quot; The remark ate_at Fitzpatrick . He got the article . Doctors comfort the bereft and may be inclined to overlook the possibility of foul_play . But a prosecutor is paid to be suspicious . To Fitzpatrick , this read like homicide . &quot; I asked myself : How could this be , the killing of five children , obvious to anyone , going undetected ? &quot; he said . He opened a preliminary file . Then , in the happenstances of career , he left the job for private practice only to return in 1992 after winning election as district_attorney . This time , he ordered an investigation . There were these clues to go_on : the initials of the babies , the name of the hospital , the general time frame of the deaths . &quot; One child had been autopsied , so there had to be some kind of report on file , &quot; Fitzpatrick said . &quot; The name Noah Hoyt popped_out . It fit perfectly . He was 2 1 / 2 months old . His diagnosis was SIDS . So now I had a name and an autopsy number . I subpoenaed the medical_records from Upstate Medical_Center . &quot; Several hundred sheets_of_paper came_in , chronicling the life_history of this young lad , Noah Hoyt . It was really so sad . For some reason , I developed an emotional attachment to Noah , you know , reading a record of virtually every day in his life . He was going_to end_up like the other four babies . You wanted to just reach back in through the hands of time and protect him. &quot; Noah had suffered those breathing problems , sometimes bad enough to turn blue . There was a curious pattern to the attacks , the prosecutor noted : &quot; They all happened while the child was in the exclusive control of the mother. &quot; Two medical_examiners were brought_in to confer . They also went_through the records , including autopsies of the fourth and fifth children . Based on the circumstantial_evidence , both agreed with Fitzpatrick : They thought the mother was a murderer . The last address in the file was in Tioga County . The Hoyts were not hard to find . The local prosecutor was notified , and the state police began their own investigation -- criminal checks , employment records , birth_certificates , marriage_license , credit profile , toll_calls . The Hoyts were as clean as could be , and there was only one more thing to do : bring the woman in_for a talk . * Three state_troopers sat in the interrogation room with Waneta . Several observers , including Fitzpatrick , were able to watch and listen through a two-way mirror . The woman seemed unruffled as they dredged_up her tragedies . Then , near the two-hour mark , the questioning took a sharper turn , with the police bluffing that they knew the whole truth , that she had killed them all . Suddenly , Waneta stiffened . And then this is what she said of her five babies , according to court records : Erik ( died Jan . 26 , 1965 , at 3 months , 10 days ) : &quot; He was crying at the time and I wanted him to stop . I held a pillow -- it might have been a sofa throw_pillow -- over his face while I was sitting on the couch . I don ' t remember if he struggled or not , but he did bleed from the mouth and nose. &quot; Julie ( died Sept . 5 , 1968 , 1 month , 17 days ) : &quot; I held her nose and mouth into my shoulder until she stopped struggling. &quot; James ( died Sept . 26 , 1968 , 2 years , 4 months ) : &quot; I was in the bathroom getting dressed and he wanted to come_in . He came_in . . . and I made him go_out . He started crying , ' Mommy , mommy. ' I wanted him to stop crying_for me so I used a bath_towel to smother him. &quot; Molly ( died June 5 , 1970 , 2 months , 18 days ) : &quot; She was just home from the hospital overnight and was crying in her crib . I used a pillow that was in the crib to smother her . After she was dead , I called Mom Hoyt ( Tim ' s mother ) and Dr. Steinschneider. &quot; Noah ( died July 28 , 1971 , 2 months , 19 days ) : &quot; I held a baby pillow over his face until he was dead . I then called_for Mom Hoyt and Dr. Steinschneider . I remember it was a hot day in July. &quot; According to some of the witnesses , at this point Waneta began to worry what people were going_to think_of her . She asked to see her husband . Tim was brought_in , and Waneta told him of her great unburdening . He chose not to believe her . Words were put_in your mouth , he suggested . She insisted otherwise . He told her he still loved her , and the confessing began again . She had seen counselors and a psychiatrist , she said in her signed confession . &quot; I feel that if I had got help from them , it would have prevented me from killing the rest of my children . I feel that I am a good_person , but I know that I did wrong . &quot; I loved my children . I love my ( adopted ) son , Jay , and my husband . I feel the burden I have carried by keeping the secret of killing my children has been a tremendous punishment . I most definitely feel remorse and regret for my actions . I cannot go_back and undo the wrong that I have done. &quot; * Waneta ' s court-appointed attorneys say they received 541 calls from the media in just the first days after her arrest for second-degree murder . TV_shows tried to fax her a contract : Would the alleged baby-killer agree to tell all on camera ? Since her confession , neither of the Hoyts has spoken publicly . Waneta is free on bond and a trial is not likely to occur for months . Her lawyers intend to attack the confession , arguing that it was taken under duress . They also hope to show that SIDS has in fact slain more_than one baby in the same family . There is evidence to support this in the medical literature , but the odds of five in one home are astronomical , many experts say . In most families , the risk of even a second SIDS death is &quot; less than 1 % , &quot; wrote Dr. Susan Beal in a 1992 article in the journal Clinics in Perinatology . Sudden Infant Death Syndrome commonly strikes babies 2 to 4 months old . No single pattern or pathological marker has been found for it . Clearly , the vast majority of mysterious infant deaths do not involve murder . Epidemiologist Philip McClain of the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention has reviewed the studies and says that estimates show child_abuse plays a role in only 1.4 % to 4.7 % of SIDS cases . Those percentages , small as they are , make the questioning of bereft parents a difficult if necessary business . Horrendous crimes have been uncovered . The best known occurred not far from here , in Schenectady , N.Y. Friends and physicians alike consoled Marybeth Tinning as , one by one , her nine children died of mysterious causes . She was convicted of murder in 1986 . Diana Lumbrera ' s first five children died between 1976 and 1984 ; so did a 2 1 / 2-month-old cousin left in her care . People who knew her in a string of West Texas towns felt sorry_for Lumbrera . She would rush the children to the hospital , but it was always too late to save them . Only when her sixth child died in Garden City , Kan. , was a murder_suspected and then proved in court . Psychiatrists speculate on motives in such cases . One theory has it that a woman who kills her child will repeat the crime to punish herself , confirming that she is an unfit mother . Another theory is the bizarre disorder known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy , named for the 18th-Century German baron who told fantastic tales . Typically , the parent -- usually the mother -- will make_up a child ' s illness or actually cause harm in_order to get attention . Some doctors say the mothers are &quot; sympathy junkies. &quot; Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy has been mentioned repeatedly in the Hoyt case , but that may be only a fondness for exotic labeling . Dr. Michael Baden , director of the forensic sciences unit of the New York State Police , has worked_on the case . He views it more matter-of-factly . &quot; Right now , it seems like straight homicide , &quot; he contended . &quot; She killed the kids because she was tired_of their crying . Waneta and her husband are very close . He was away at_work a lot , and maybe she couldn ' t handle the stress . &quot; With her adopted baby , her husband had been laid_off and he was at_home to help_out . With the other kids , when she couldn ' t handle things , she only could figure_out one way to keep them quiet . She killed them. &quot; * Dr. Alfred Steinschneider has the affable presence of a country_doctor . His sentences mingle medical jargon with the easy humor of his native Brooklyn . He remains a believer in this controversial notion : that some SIDS cases are predictable -- and preventable with the use of monitoring equipment at_home . In hindsight , some people have questioned his judgment in the Hoyt case . One is prosecutor Fitzpatrick . &quot; How could a doctor not realize that Molly and Noah were in harm ' s way ? I know it was 2 1 / 2 decades ago . But was he overly consumed with expounding on his theory or was he concerned with his patient ? &quot; That is a hurtful accusation for Steinschneider , who has devoted much of his life to the study of SIDS . He is a founder and president of the American SIDS Institute in Atlanta . His ability to defend himself is limited by confidentiality requirements that he feels duty-bound to honor . &quot; What ' s missing from all this cheap talk , this impugning of motives , this show_biz , is that it doesn ' t save a single baby , &quot; he said . &quot; What they ought to be saying is : ' Let ' s examine the deaths of babies and make better identification of the causes of deaths to help sort things out. ' &quot; In the Hoyt case , he relied_on the opinions of the medical_examiners . &quot; If people think there were inadequate autopsies done , then check the autopsies , big_shots , &quot; he said . &quot; If they think these kids were murdered , then show me , because what they are saying now is at_variance with what the people who investigated the case said then . If there ' s criticism I ' ll accept from the pathologists , it ' s that I accepted the opinion of other pathologists. &quot; To him , the current focus_on his 1972 article misses the point . &quot; In college , I learned the word heuristic , and that ' s what is important here . Was the paper heuristic : Did_it lead to learning ? The important thing is not the paper itself ; it ' s that the paper led to a significant amount of learning. &quot; He paused for a moment . His eyes lit with a thought . &quot; Without the paper , &quot; he said , &quot; would people even know this case existed ? &quot; * These days , Waneta spends a lot of her time caring for her sister , the one dying of a brain_tumor . She has begun to attend church again after missing some Sundays . Her friends call_on her and try to cheer her up . Those friends are appalled by what they hear on the news . This woman described as a baby-killer -- this abomination -- is not the Waneta they know . Accepting the allegations is as crazy and unthinkable to them as summer coming_after fall . What is behind this feeding frenzy for vengeance , they ask . &quot; They arrested Waneta and then put her on suicide watch so they could keep her safe and kill her later , &quot; said her minister , the Rev . Lisa Jean Hoefner . &quot; Nothing is going_to bring those kids back now . In the meantime , we destroy Jay and Tim and Waneta . What sense is that ? &quot; Newark Valley seems to have been invaded by big-city experts and their big-city ideas . What strikes people as particularly odd are notions such_as Munchausen by Proxy . &quot; If you want to be psychological , let ' s ask if this is Fitzpatrick ' s way of getting_back at his mother , &quot; the minister said . &quot; Or ask what office he ' s running_for . Is this his way of getting attention ? &quot; Their neighbor Waneta holds a blank_check on their loyalty . How could it be otherwise ? Natalie Hilliard , in defending her friend , was struck by another memory . She recalled how she had helped a pregnant Waneta set_up a room for the little ones about to be born . And how , time and again , they had tearfully packed the baby things away .</TEXT>
