   <HEADLINE> COMBATTING HATE ; BIAS : CRIMES AGAINST MINORITIES ARE INCREASING ACROSS THE BOARD -- WITH GAYS NOW VICTIMIZED THE MOST . THE VAST MAJORITY OF INCIDENTS WILL GO UNPROSECUTED AS THE VIOLENCE EXTRACTS A HEAVY PERSONAL TOLL IN THE COUNTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Floyd thought it would never happen to him . But soon after the 28-year-old gay_man moved_into a Van Nuys apartment complex in 1993 , his life became a nightmare . It started when his building manager called him &quot; fag &quot; in front of other tenants . Someone scratched a huge &quot; F &quot; into his car . He found excrement smeared on his front_door . One neighbor shoved him , and another threatened to kill him . &quot; Why are you doing this ? &quot; a shaken Floyd asked . The answer came_back loud and clear : Because he was gay . Floyd called the police seven times during 1993 but declined to file charges after the assault , mistakenly believing that the torment would stop . After other incidents , police told him it was tough to solve anonymous acts of vandalism and that they could not act_on threats unless accompanied by an illegal act . &quot; I felt so helpless , &quot; recalled Floyd , who moved to West Hollywood in January because he feared for his life . &quot; I thought : ' Do I have to get killed before the police will do something ? ' I ' d heard about homophobia and harassment , but I never thought it would happen to me . I thought people would treat me as an individual. &quot; Floyd ' s case is not unique . Last week , Los Angeles County released its annual hate crimes report , which recorded 783 such crimes in 1993 , a 6.4 % jump over the previous year . For the first time since 1980 , when the county began tracking , gay_men supplanted African Americans as the primary target . Hate crimes are increasing across the board -- and they are getting more violent . Although the stereotypical act of hatred may be a spray-painted swastika or scrawled racial epithet , almost one-third of hate crimes in 1993 were assaults , 105 with deadly weapons , according to the study . The vast majority will go unprosecuted . According to the county Commission on Human Relations , only 12 hate crimes came_to trial last year . Trials in two more cases , in which people were killed , are pending . Floyd ' s case illustrates the difficulty that victims and law_enforcement agencies face in recognizing and prosecuting such crimes . Los Angeles Police_Department officials will not comment on how many hate crimes lead to arrests , and the district_attorney ' s office cannot break_out hate crimes on its computers . &quot; We struggle with overwhelming odds at every level , &quot; said Kay Shafer , the hate crimes coordinator for the district_attorney ' s office . Many victims -- including Floyd -- say they did not know there was a law against hate crimes . Others are not sure what qualifies as a hate crime . The Human Relations Commission says leaning out of a car_window and calling someone a racially charged name would not qualify . Spray-painting a swastika on a synagogue would . Obscene or threatening phone_calls that contain racial , ethnic , religious , homophobic or sexist slurs are hate crimes . But a fight between a white_man and a black_man would not be logged as a hate crime unless racial epithets were exchanged . Community groups monitor the figures closely . A spokesman for the American Jewish Committee noted that Jews are victims in disproportionate numbers -- they constitute only 5 % of the Los Angeles County population but account_for 89.5 % of all religious hate crimes . Frank Berry , a spokesman for the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , said gays may have a higher profile this year but that the number of hate crimes against African Americans is still alarming . Consider Robert Lee Johnson , who is African American . Johnson said he and his family were the target of a Latino street gang . * It started with racial taunts . His daughters were assaulted on the way to the market . In February , Johnson was shot as he watched TV in his living room . Two weeks later , someone threw a pipe_bomb into his rented Norwalk home , which burned_down . The family , which included children and grandchildren , lost everything they had . Now living_in Compton , Johnson is trying to put the trauma behind him . However , he said , &quot; We deal with it every day . It ' s always there . It will probably always be there. &quot; Johnson is frustrated by the limits of the system . Initially , he said , the Sheriff ' s Department &quot; did a lot of hesitating . When we called , it was like ' No one ' s hurt. ' They got offended when my son told them it was a Latino gang . They said , ' How did you know it was a Mexican ? What was the motive ? ' Suspicion ' s being turned_on me . We haven ' t committed any crime. &quot; Shanon Hodges , a gay African American , recalls the difficulty he had persuading police that he was the victim of a hate crime in 1989 . Hodges had gone_to see about renting a Silver Lake apartment and was walking down the street about 9:30 p.m. Three white skinheads between the ages of 17 and 19 approached , and Hodges , who sensed trouble , began to run . One youth yelled , &quot; Nigger faggot , I ' m going_to kill you , &quot; Hodges said , and stabbed him in the back with a jagged six-inch knife . Hodges staggered down the street and fell_into the first open_door . It was a gay bar , whose manager called police and an ambulance . When police arrived , Hodges said , they pulled on his earrings , called him names and told him the attack was his fault . Hodges said he spent eight hours at County-USC Medical_Center waiting to be treated . The assailants were never caught . An LAPD spokesman declined to comment on the case , saying that &quot; if conduct like that ( by the officers ) happened , it ' s inappropriate , and we have a process for dealing with that , if ( Hodges ) wants to file a complaint. &quot; Hodges ' scars -- both physical and emotional -- remain five years later . He dropped_out of art_school . He became estranged from friends . He broke_off with his lover because , he said , he felt ugly . He tried counseling , but it did not help . He tried drawing , but the pictures were so angry , he tore them up . As with the attack on Hodges , many hate crimes occur at night . Assailants use a hit-and-run approach that leaves few clues . Victims , whether gays in the closet , African Americans disaffected with law_enforcement or immigrants fearing deportation , often do not call the police . Immigrants ' rights groups say their clients can be deported if they report a hate crime and an investigation shows that they are here illegally . Some argue that California needs to amend its laws so that victims cannot be deported or kicked_out of the military for reporting hate crimes . Even when victims step_forward , community activists say , police do not always log the incident as a hate crime -- a charge the police deny . And if arrests are made and charges filed , the district_attorney must prove that the defendant committed the crime and that it was motivated by hatred . &quot; These are among the most underreported and underprosecuted crimes around , &quot; said Brian Levin , a visiting scholar at Stanford Law_School , who is legal director for the Center for the Study of Ethnic and Racial Violence . Even county statistics are incomplete because only nine of about 40 law_enforcement agencies provided data . West Covina logged 12 hate crimes last year that were not included in the countywide total of 783 . West Covina police crime analyst Anne Gray said the county never requested information on hate crimes ; the county said it contacts each agency . Shafer , of the district_attorney ' s office , said that thanks to massive media attention and education programs by community groups and law_enforcement , awareness about hate crime is growing . But she likens it to the status of domestic violence and sexual_assaults 10 or 15 years ago . Levin estimates that half of all hate crimes still go unreported ; in the gay community , he believes , the figure may be as high as 90 % . Only about 1 % are prosecuted , he said . &quot; Getting the line_officer , who is the most cynical and least trained , to understand what constitutes a hate crime is very difficult , &quot; said Levin , a former police_officer who now runs hate crime training_programs for various police_departments . Cmdr . John White , the LAPD ' s hate crime coordinator , disagrees . &quot; A lot of people go_around bashing the police , but I don ' t think there ' s a police_department in the country that has a system as efficient as us for handling hate crimes , &quot; White said . Each LAPD division has a hate crimes coordinator , White said . All rookies study the issue at the police_academy and receive in-service training , including periodic memos from White . When a hate crime report is filed , follow-up calls are made to the victim ' s home . &quot; We try to find a nexus , a connection between the crime and the person . . . but often there ' s not enough evidence . If the suspect didn ' t say anything ( racist or homophobic ) , it ' s hard to classify it as a hate crime , &quot; White said . Hate crimes are up , experts say , because Americans seek scapegoats for their declining living standards . Hate crimes between minority groups are rising as well as crimes against whites . &quot; When you get this fear and frustration , people revert back to their in-group and want to find a target for their anger , &quot; Levin said . &quot; We still harbor stereotypes , and they ' re the trigger that someone who is_sick or angry or frustrated can beat_up on. &quot; Society also suffers because hate crimes breed fear and distrust among groups , dividing people into either victims or perpetrators , Levin said . Hate groups recognize the fragility of the inter-group bond and how easy it is to disrupt . They know a burglary will not cause a riot but hope that a hate crime might . Yet most perpetrators are not members of organized groups . About 85 % are male , in their early or mid-teens , and lead a marginal existence , said Jack Levin , a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University , who co-wrote &quot; Hate Crimes , the Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed. &quot; &quot; Twenty years ago they might have stolen hubcaps ; now they beat people up , &quot; Levin said . &quot; They are unremarkable types , the kids down the block . Very few wear sheets or armbands or hoods. &quot; The boy next door was exactly who terrorized John Ruiz and his family in Arleta for two years . Paul M . Downing , who mistakenly believed that Ruiz was Jewish , spray-painted anti-Semitic graffiti and swastikas on the walls , set fires in their home and fired shots into the window . Ruiz , a Catholic of Spanish ancestry , said he had &quot; a great_deal of difficulty &quot; in getting police interested . Detectives turned_up nothing . Ruiz turned_to the Anti-Defamation League , who persuaded the FBI to pursue it as a civil_rights violation . Downing pleaded guilty to eight felonies and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1991 . * But the fight left profound scars . After spending $ 20 # 000 on_fire repairs , Ruiz sold his home of 15 years , where he had hoped to retire . He lost his job as a national sales manager because he was afraid to leave his family to go_on business trips . Today , Ruiz lives in a security building , in a place he will not reveal . He no longer registers to vote because he fears that Downing could obtain his address . He and his wife flinch each time a motorcycle passes because the hatemonger once harassed them from his motorcycle . &quot; This has been such a trauma in our lives that we just can ' t shake it , &quot; Ruiz said &quot; I am an Everyman . I believe_in live and let live . I love my country . And it ' s horrifying to me that this can be happening in America . But you can ' t let something like this consume your sanity because then he won . To a degree he won anyway . This will always be with us. &quot; Compiling Hate Criminal threats and assaults were the most prevalent forms of hate crime reported in Los Angeles County in 1993 , according to an annual study of hate crimes in the region . Here is how often types of hate crimes occurred . 03 # 29 , 08 # 12 NUMBER PERCENTAGE Criminal threats 241 30.8 % Assaults 233 29.8 % Vandalism 130 16.6 % Assaults with deadly weapon 105 13.4 % Graffiti / vandalism 22 2.8 % Hate literature 17 2.2 % Others 35 4.5 % Source : Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations</TEXT>
