   <HEADLINE> COUNTY RESIDENTS HEALTHIER THAN MOST , STATE FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County residents are healthier than most other Californians , according to state figures released Monday that depict the county death rate as below the statewide average and continuing to decline . Two of the leading causes of death -- cancer and stroke -- are claiming lives at a much lower rate here , although the state as_a_whole is also seeing an improvement , according to the state_Department of Health Services report . And while Orange County ranks in the bottom half of the state ' s 58 counties for the death rate of another major killer , coronary heart_disease , the ailment is declining here . Moreover , deaths from accidental_injuries are lower in Orange County than in three-fourths of the counties . Among the few negative findings : Orange County ' s death rate from homicides and motor_vehicle crashes , and the incidence of AIDS and tuberculosis , are_on the upswing . These were some highlights of comparative mortality and morbidity statistics the state has compiled for 1990 through 1992 , ranking counties by their rate of disease or death per 100 # 000 population while making statistical adjustments for differences in population age . A similar report for 1989 through 1991 was released by the state health agency a year ago , with the objective of tracking the progress the state is making toward meeting national health goals for the year 2000 . Overall , Orange County ' s average annual mortality_rate from sickness or disease for 1990 through 1992 was 14 # 597 , or 414.9 deaths per 100 # 000 . That was better than the statewide average of 479.6 , and below an average rate of 432.5 for Orange County in 1989 through 1991 . The state death rate also declined from 495 per 100 # 000 in the earlier three-year period . Mono County had the lowest death rate in the state , with 314 deaths per 100 # 000 . The worst rate was 637 in San Francisco . Dr. George Rutherford , deputy director of prevention services for the state , attributed California ' s overall strong showing partly to &quot; very aggressive anti-smoking campaigns &quot; and laws requiring the use of automobile seat_belts , child car_seats and motorcycle helmets . The state report ranked the counties for major causes of death , placing counties with the lowest death rates at the top . &quot; Orange County was in the top quartile for everything but breast_cancer , coronary heart_disease and infant_mortality , &quot; noted Sheila Dumbauld , research manager for the planning and data analysis section of the state_Department of Health Services . She said she assumed that Orange County &quot; does very well in most indicators probably because it is a wealthy county and people can afford to get health care. &quot; However , county health officials disputed her interpretation . &quot; It looks good , but I have no idea what it means , &quot; said Tom Uram , director of the Orange County Health_Care Agency . &quot; Like many other counties , we have pockets of poverty , AIDS and homelessness. &quot; Dr. Hugh Stallworth , Orange County ' s new public health officer , said the state report doesn ' t put him at_ease . &quot; Does_it mean we should fold_up our tents ? I don ' t think so , &quot; he said . &quot; We have AIDS and tuberculosis to deal with. &quot; The report showed there was an annual average of 472 new diagnosed cases of AIDS in 1990 through 1992 , a rate of 19.1 per 100 # 000 population , up from an average of 397 new cases per year from 1989 through 1991 , which is a rate of 16.4 per 100 # 000 population . Similarly , a yearly average of 316 new TB cases was reported in Orange County from 1990 through 1992 , or 12.8 cases per 100 # 000 population , up from 280 cases in 1989 through 1991 , at a rate of 11.6 cases per 100 # 000 population . Stallworth said there are other preventable deaths that he wants the county to address , such_as the drowning of children in swimming_pools that are not properly fenced . &quot; I don ' t see cutting_back on our public health programs , &quot; he said . &quot; Just because we are in the top quartile of the state doesn ' t give me any peace or make me feel terribly wonderful . . . . Quite frankly it doesn ' t change the way we do business. &quot; O.C. ' s Health Report_Card Orange County ' s death rate ranks eighth lowest among the state ' s 58 counties . Deaths from lung_cancer , breast_cancer and coronary heart_disease also are_on the decline , making Orange County one of the healthiest counties in the state .
