   <HEADLINE> O.C. CONFERENCE TO CHART ORANGUTAN ' S SURVIVAL PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sacrificed to a worldwide demand for mahogany to fashion into desks and dining_tables , lost to a need for land to feed a growing population , the rain_forests of Borneo and Sumatra are fast dwindling . And as these big_trees fall , so too goes the only habitat of the orangutan . Today , half a world away from where the species is making its last stand , scientists , zoo administrators , conservationists and government officials meet at Cal State Fullerton to assess the accelerating threats facing the orangutan and forge a strategy to help it survive . &quot; The ultimate problem , like it is for so many species on this planet , is habitat destruction , &quot; said Birute Galdikas , co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Orangutan Foundation International , who has spent the last 23 years studying orangutans in the forests of Borneo . &quot; Without the trees they simply cannot survive. &quot; Uncertainties abound over just how many orangutans remain in the wild , but experts believe as much as half the population has been lost over the past decade , and the shaggy red ape could be extinct soon after the turn_of_the_century if current deforestation practices continue . Named for an Indonesian phrase meaning &quot; man of the forest , &quot; orangutans are the most solitary of the great_apes , ranging widely as they travel through the forest canopy . As development of their once-lush island habitat continues , the highly intelligent animals -- among the closest living relatives to humankind -- are forced to survive in smaller and more isolated pockets of protected land . Two large islands in the Indonesian archipelago , Borneo and Sumatra , were still heavily covered with forests when Galdikas began her independent studies in 1971 . Since then , an estimated 80 % of the orangutan ' s habitat has been cleared , both through commercial logging and agriculture . The orangutan population is estimated today at anywhere from 20 # 000 to 50 # 000 . Organizers hope this weekend ' s conference will go beyond traditional academic presentations to plans for protecting the endangered primate . &quot; Usually , at these kinds of sessions you go , you read your paper and you go_home , &quot; said Lori Sheeran , faculty adviser for the conference . &quot; Here , we want something concrete. &quot; In the past , academic conferences have had &quot; a minimal impact on conservation of species , &quot; said Ulysses Seal , a conservation biologist . &quot; This reflects a longstanding division between the academic and the conservation communities. &quot; That division , he said , is slowly dissolving , as the Fullerton conference illustrates . Titled &quot; Orang utans : The Neglected Ape , &quot; the three-day meeting was organized by Norm Rosen , a graduate_student in anthropology at Cal State Fullerton who learned in the course of his research two years ago that there hadn ' t been a major academic conference on the animal since 1979 . &quot; It ' s been so many years since conservationists and field people and zoo people have gotten_together to discuss the problems facing orangutans , &quot; Rosen said . He approached the faculty of the university ' s anthropology_department and decided to organize the conference as his master ' s project . A number of individuals and organizations have worked together to bring the conference to Fullerton , including the school ' s Anthropology Student Assn. , the Zoological Society of San Diego and Zoo Atlanta . Even with a renewed commitment from the Indonesian government , deforestation and illegal hunting -- for food and for the pet trade -- continue . Much of the logging is selective , but often the trees left standing_by loggers are quickly felled to make room for agriculture . Also , said Mark Leighton a Harvard_University professor , too_little is known about the eating habits and movements of the animal to create an effective management plan . &quot; There ' s a strong need for better surveys of remaining forested areas in Borneo , and in some cases a redesign of the reserve system , &quot; Leighton said . Also , he said , &quot; it has to be approached as a comprehensive problem , not just orangutans. &quot; Borneo and Sumatra are home to a number of equally endangered forest species , many of them found nowhere else : proboscis_monkeys , clouded leopards , Sumatran tigers , even rhinoceroses . The conservation situation in Sumatra is somewhat different . The island , all_of which is part of the nation of Indonesia , has a single national_park of more_than 2.2 million acres . Partly as a result of a workshop organized by Seal_in Sumatra last year , the Indonesian government has set as a goal a sustained population of 10 # 000 orangutans on that island . Seal estimates there are currently about 8 # 500 on the island , some 30 % of them living outside the national_park on less-protected lands . The success of the Indonesian effort will depend largely on international financial_support for park management and basic research , Seal said . Almost 60 professionals will make presentations at the conference , and about 200 more will attend . In addition to Galdikas and Seal , other top orangutan experts to take_part include J.A.R.A.M. van Hooff of Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht in the_Netherlands , Jito Sugardjito , an Indonesian scientist affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund , and Terry L . Maple , director of Zoo Atlanta . Through accounts in the mainstream press and on television , Galdikas is probably the best known to the public . She is one of the so-called &quot; Leakey ' s Angels , &quot; three students of famed anthropologist Louis Leakey , who went_out to study great_apes in their natural homes . Jane Goodall , famous for her studies of chimpanzees , was another ; Dian Fossey , who championed the preservation of the mountain_gorilla until her murder in 1985 , was the third . In recent years , Galdikas has spent increasing amounts of her energy on promoting preservation , leading some to criticize her for neglecting research . She downplays such comments : &quot; I think , given the desperate nature of the situation , we must consider the conservation issues to be of primary importance , &quot; Galdikas said by telephone from a home she maintains in Los Angeles . Her relationship with the Indonesian government has been strained at times , but Galdikas said she has seen a major shift in the last year . &quot; I think there ' s a new maturity in the Indonesian forestry department , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve been very , very pleased. &quot; The 1990s are &quot; a critical decade &quot; in determining whether the orangutan will survive in the wild , said Leighton , the Harvard_University researcher who has done field_work in Borneo for 20 years . There is hope , he said , but that hope hinges_on a number of needs : more research on how the animals live , better management schemes , more money and training to implement those plans . Still , obstacles remain in Kalimantan , the Indonesian state that comprises the southern two-thirds of Borneo ( most of the northern part of the island is under Malaysian control ) . Orangutans there number between 10 # 000 and 15 # 000 , by Leighton ' s best guess , but many of those are in scattered and fragmented populations that may be too small to survive over time . The theme of this weekend ' s conference , &quot; The Neglected Ape , &quot; reflects the belief of many that orangutans get less press than their more-publicized cousins , the gorillas and the chimpanzees , and that an increased public awareness could lead to more dollars for conservation . As far as Galdikas is concerned , however , the orangutan has suffered from too_much attention -- of the wrong kind , from loggers and poachers . &quot; I think what the orangutans need is a lot more neglect , &quot; she said . Galdikas said she still feels the same connection with her research subjects as when she first went_into the jungle as a UCLA graduate of 25 , a connection amplified by a sense of urgency over their fate . &quot; When you look_into an orangutan ' s eyes , the eyes that look_back mirror our own , &quot; she said . &quot; We recognize his or her affinity , that there is something else on this earth that is almost us . In a way , we ' re looking_at where we ' ve been. &quot;</TEXT>
