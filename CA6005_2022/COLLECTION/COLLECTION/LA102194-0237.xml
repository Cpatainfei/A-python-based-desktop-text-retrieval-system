   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; SERB PRESIDENT GETTING REWARDS DESPITE DEFIANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the rush to reward Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for his pledge to be a partner in the search for Balkan peace , Western governments have swept aside evidence of his flouting of the outside world ' s will and conscience . Consider these acts of defiance , which once spurred Western outrage but now go unmentioned in diplomatic exchanges : * Serbian government officials have failed to repatriate two kidnaped American children known to be held_in Serbia , despite eight court decisions ordering them returned immediately to their mother in California . * Human_rights monitors from the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe continue to be barred from the volatile Serbian regions of Kosovo , Vojvodina and Sandjzak -- the very regions where Balkan turmoil threatens to spread . * Banished from Yugoslavia in April , 14 foreign correspondents , including one from the Los Angeles Times , remain unable to enter the country in which Milosevic wields unchallenged power . Shayna Gluck -- whose children Sasha Lazarevich , 12 , and Andre Lazarevich , 9 , were seized from Santa Cruz by her ex-husband five years ago -- says she is astounded that the United States would help reward Milosevic when Washington ' s entreaties for her children ' s release have been ignored . American and Yugoslav courts have consistently ruled_in Gluck ' s favor on her claim to full custody of the children . The U.S._government and its embassy in Belgrade have pressed her appeals_to find and return the children , taken_after a September , 1989 , weekend outing_in Santa Cruz by their father , Dragisa Lazarevich . But earlier this month , the Serbian Justice Ministry informed the top U.S. diplomat in Belgrade that a Belgrade court had temporarily reassigned custody to the father on the advice of a &quot; team of experts &quot; who had examined and interviewed the children at a time and site Serbian officials refused to reveal . Gluck has now been told by U.S. authorities to pursue her search through the Serbian legal_system . Milosevic , considered the mastermind of the deadly wars that have racked the Balkans since 1991 , made a break_with his Bosnian Serb proxies in August , proclaiming a cutoff of all fuel and military aid until they sign a peace plan . He turned_on his longtime allies at the encouragement of the Contact Group , the mediation effort waged by diplomats from the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . The Contact Group had hinted that there might be relief from a May , 1992 , economic embargo imposed on Serb-led Yugoslavia for instigating the Bosnian war . A month after Milosevic ' s much-heralded break_with Bosnian Serb rebels , and despite assertions by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry that the blockade was less than ironclad , the U.N. Security_Council reinstated air_travel , sports and cultural contacts in reward for Milosevic ' s proclaimed support for the Contact Group ' s peace plan . That international effort to force Bosnian Serbs to capitulate has also muffled the European security conference ' s desire to return human_rights monitors to Serbian trouble spots . Milosevic had the monitors expelled last year after they issued reports documenting systematic abuses of the rights of minority Albanians , Hungarians and Muslims living_in Serbia . Western concern about press freedom and security has also been heightened . Earlier this month , the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists was preparing an appeal_to the Yugoslav government for restoration of press credentials lifted from 14 Western journalists in April in retaliation for a NATO air strike against Bosnian Serb rebels attacking the U.N. &quot; safe haven &quot; of Gorazde . U.N. Sanctions in the Balkans The United Nations restricted travel and trade_in an effort to end the war in the Balkans . As a reward for Slobodan Milosevic ' s peace efforts , the U.N. Security_Council later lifted some sanctions in the rump Yugoslavia . FORMER YUGOSLAVIA Why sanctions were imposed : To reduce carnage from Balkans warfare and to penalize parties in the combat . Date sanctions were imposed : 1991 U.N. resolution number : 713 Sanctions : Arms embargo RUMP YUGOSLAVIA Why sanctions were imposed : To pressure Serbs to force Bosnian Serbs to end fighting and accept U.N. peace proposals Date sanctions were imposed : 1992 , 1993 , 1994 U.N. resolution number : 713 Sanctions : All trade and international economic activity prohibited . Overseas assets frozen . Embargo on air , sea and rail connections with outside world . Bans on sports and cultural exchanges . Some of these sanctions--including the travel ban , the exchange prohibition and a ban on ferry travel_to Italy--were lifted recently .</TEXT>
