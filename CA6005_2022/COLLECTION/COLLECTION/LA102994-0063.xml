   <HEADLINE> CLUB ' S ONGOING SUCCESS SPEAKS VOLUMES ; ORGANIZATIONS : 70 YEARS AFTER IT WAS FOUNDED IN SANTA ANA , TOASTMASTERS STILL HELPS PEOPLE EXPRESS THEMSELVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In meeting rooms across America , secretaries , engineers and executives gather regularly for sessions that often begin with a salute to Ralph C . Smedley . They are members of Toastmasters International , and they still pay homage to Smedley , who founded the organization 70 years ago this month in the basement of the YMCA in Santa Ana . Started as a self-help group for people jittery about speaking in public , Toastmasters now boasts 8 # 100 chapters -- including about 200 in Orange County -- where members for years have been meeting weekly to practice making speeches and to critique each other ' s oratorical efforts . And , in the ' 90s , Toastmasters is finding a new niche : teaching professionals in technical fields how to prepare a talk and deliver it effectively . &quot; Engineers are notorious for being bad oral communicators , &quot; said William Womack , a professor of communications at Chapman University in Orange . &quot; I have seen some who are great , but they are definitely the exception. &quot; Still , technology experts are often called_upon to meet with clients and to give presentations , and if they do badly , the employer ' s image may suffer . To make_sure that doesn ' t happen , some of Southern California ' s biggest corporations sponsor their own Toastmasters groups , among them Fluor Daniel Inc. , Bergen Brunswig Corp. , CalComp Inc. , Rockwell International Corp . and McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co . Encouraging employees to become better communicators is also a way to prepare them for upper management , said Renee Christensen , an industrial psychologist and president of Employee Support_Systems Co . in Orange . Even the brightest and most capable people , she said , are unlikely candidates for executive positions if they cannot present themselves well . Executives are blunt about the problem : &quot; Engineers tend to be very introverted , &quot; said Bob Johnson , director of contracts at Anaheim-based CalComp , a division of defense_contractor Lockheed Corp . Johnson joined Toastmasters in 1960 because he suffered almost debilitating attacks of &quot; butterflies &quot; before every talk he gave . &quot; I was scared to death when I was called_upon to speak at project meetings , &quot; said Johnson , who was a business manager at Hughes Electronics in Fullerton at the time . After a year at Toastmasters , he said , he not only overcame his fear but polished his skills so that he has since had the confidence to seek jobs that require public_speaking . Anxiety about giving speeches is quite common , said J . Douglas Andrews , professor of business communications and assistant dean of USC ' s School of Business Administration . In fact , it is the situation that many people say they fear most , according to several studies . The best way to overcome that fear and to become a calm , effective speaker , he said , is simply to practice and get some feedback . Toastmasters strives to help men and women do just that . The meetings always start and end on_time , and they follow a strict schedule . To ensure that the speeches , limited to about seven minutes each , end promptly , a timekeeper is chosen for each session to signal the speakers if they talk too long . A member may play one of a number of roles . The Toastmaster of the Day presides over the meeting . A grammarian is appointed to monitor awkward and improper uses of language . And the &quot; ah counter &quot; is responsible_for tallying the number of times a speaker pauses and says , &quot; Ah . . . . &quot; Everyone plays the role of evaluator . At the end of the &quot; table topics &quot; section of the meeting , when some members are called_upon to give impromptu two-minute speeches on assigned topics , everyone else evaluates the presentations . Those giving prepared speeches also get critiques . And members recognize each others ' achievements by voting on the best prepared speech , the most improved speaker and the best impromptu presentation . Though the sessions are rigorous -- each includes a brief business meeting , about 10 speeches plus evaluations , all_in two hours or less -- the atmosphere is comfortable and supportive . At the end of each speech , during recognition times and even during the business segment , members applaud each other often and heartily . The evaluations , even when critical , are couched in kind words . A limitation to the method , Chapman professor Womack said , is that emphasis is_on actual presentation of the speech , not on how it is constructed . A person might be a bad speaker , he said , because he or she is a bad writer and cannot organize material in a logical way that an audience can follow . But Andrews at USC contests that . Businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the value of effective communication in the workplace , and , given that hiring experts to coach people one on one would be prohibitively expensive , he said , Toastmasters is a cost-effective alternative . The organization , which charges $ 36 a person for annual dues plus a $ 16 fee for materials , gives novice speakers what they need most , Andrews said : a lot of practice and constant feedback . Many chapters , he said , have volunteer advisers who teach others how to be good evaluators or may even do most of the critiques themselves . Toastmasters now has 170 # 000 members across the United States and 50 other countries . Over the years , more_than 3 million people have enrolled in the program . Women , excluded for the first 50 years of Toastmasters ' existence , now make_up half of the membership , and the organization this year has its second female national president . She is Pauline Shirley , executive manager of Sherman R . Smoot Corp. , a construction management firm in Washington . Among Toastmasters ' graduates are some of America ' s top_executives : Paul Orreffice , former chairman of Dow Chemical Co. ; Peter Coors , chief_executive_officer of Coors Brewing Co. ; and Les McCraw , chief_executive_officer of Fluor Corp . Most companies with their own Toastmasters chapters provide a space to meet and offer moral support . The employees themselves typically pay their own fees , but some corporations , including Fluor , pick_up part of the tab . McDonnell Douglas offers another incentive for joining Toastmasters : Time spent in meetings can count as part of the continuing education each employee is required to complete every year . Companies see a definite advantage to having Toastmasters in-house . &quot; We absolutely see them improve their speaking skills , &quot; said Carol Sherman , executive_vice_president at Bergen Brunswig Corp . in Orange , which founded its chapter in 1989 . &quot; It benefits us because they are participating in meetings both inside and outside the company all_the time. &quot; * NO . 1 TOASTMASTER : Founder Ralph C .
