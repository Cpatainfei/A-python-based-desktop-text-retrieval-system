   <HEADLINE> RENTS RAVAGING MOBILE_HOME PARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * The committees of the four Lake Forest mobile_home parks wish to express their appreciation for the article &quot; Wheels Turning at Mobile_Home Parks in O.C. &quot; ( April 3 ) . Residents of the four parks ( with 1 # 228 homes ) have been trying to get some relief from the Lake Forest City_Council for almost two years , with no success.Council members feel we need help , but they must feel that if they do something to help us , the four mobile_home park owners will file a lawsuit against them . I have lived_in El Toro Mobile Estates for 19 years , and I fully expected to spend my remaining years in this park . For the first nine years , the rent was governed by the Consumer_Price_Index . Since 1984 , our rent has increased double the CPI . There are 50 homes for_sale ; 10 have been abandoned ; and six people moved their homes from the park and have started their own real_estate agency . We have 150 widows living_in this park ; some are not going_to be able to remain here and are not_able to sell their homes either . JOE LEE Lake Forest</TEXT>
