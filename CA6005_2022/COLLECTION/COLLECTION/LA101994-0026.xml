   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; ART , LIFE ARE EQUALS IN INDONESIA WORKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Browsing the vast residue of world art can give the brain claustrophobia , like a library out of shelf space . To deal with this overload , the mind simplifies treasures into categories and categories into cliches . Um , let ' s see -- African art is sort of blocky , pre-Columbian tubular and squat while Oceanic leans to the spiky . Such pigeonholes have their uses but are inherently confining . that ' s why exhibitions such_as two new ones at UCLA ' s Fowler Museum of Cultural History are so bracing . They let fresh air into the attic of perception and rearrange the old furniture . Titled &quot; Arc of the Ancestors &quot; and &quot; Gift of the Cotton Maiden , &quot; they present venerated objects from Indonesia , a geography rarely the subject of aesthetic scrutiny , despite being the fourth most populated place on the planet and the largest of Muslim nations . Sailing off the southern coast of continental Asia , it ' s an archipelago consisting_of more_than 13 # 000 islands . They spread across the map in an upward-smiling curve . Aptly enough that curve is a leitmotif of Indonesian art . According to art history professor Jerome Feldman , the show ' s curator and author of the informative catalogue , the curve turns_up in everything from saddle-shaped roofs to dagger hilts . Sure enough , it does . Aside from that , the exhibition tends to throw viewers a bit of a curve of its own . The art ' s purposes are familiar enough . These 70-odd objects donated from the collection of Jerome L . Joss involve the veneration of ancestors , encouragement of fertility , celebration of harvest and the rest of the earthy and sidereal themes typical of such magical art . It ' s their form that challenges preconception . Lovingly patterned surfaces seem to combine Oriental refinement with the ferocity of objects from the Sepik River region of New Guinea . It ' s as if Indonesia remembered the high cultures that flourished in Java and Sumatra in the 12th and 14th centuries , and before that the presence of Buddhist and Hindu influences , not to mention the residue left_behind by such colonialist powers as Portugal , the_Netherlands and Japan . When you add this historical palimpsest to the polyglot of local-dialect styles that make_up this art , it ' s a marvelous melange . A decently cultivated viewer might get a mental toehold on all this by remembering the elegance of Javanese rod puppets . In fact the most spectacular work in_view is a puppet , but of a very different sort . Called a Sigalegale , it was fashioned by an artist of the Toba Batak people of North Sumatra and depicts a near life-size male figure carved from wood dressed in a robe and turban-like hat . ( In woollier days the head was covered in human skin or fashioned from a real skull. ) He stands atop a decorated wooden box containing the complex mechanism that runs him . He can dance , blink or even weep , all apparently unaided because the operator sits at a discreet distance . His job is to soothe the spirits of those who died childless . He symbolizes all_the substitutes people use for unborn offspring -- art , pets , dolls , cars . . . . He is Pinocchio eternally promising Geppetto that some day he ' ll be a real boy . Indonesian art has a knack for this kind of archetypal imagery . A pair of carved wood male and female ancestor figures from the Nage of Flores Island look_at once like infants and adults . Depicted nude , they have large round heads , simplified features and minimal emphasis on gender differences . Their artist imbued them with a combination of innocence and savagery that is both Shakespeare ' s Calaban and Freud ' s Id . Textiles are generically less directly expressive than figurative objects , but anyone who appreciates the form , likes abstract_art or wants to flesh_out their impressions of Indonesian society shouldn ' t pass_up the Fowler ' s companion exhibition . Organized by the museum and assembled by curator Roy Hamilton , &quot; Gift of the Cotton Maiden ; Textiles of Flores and the Solar Islands &quot; is the first comprehensive show ever devoted to the subject . Its 288-page catalogue is richly illustrated and redolent with revealing stories . One tells of an Indonesian group who regards the normally esteemed weaver as bearing a curse . Generally the &quot; Cotton Maiden &quot; is valued as a practitioner of women ' s most important work . Making sarongs and shawls is venerated as an important source of income and prestige since the items play an important role as brides ' wealth . Designs passed down the generations are so distinctive it ' s possible to tell where a person comes from by the pattern of their garb . When girls are old enough to undertake weaving they dance the streets with anklets of cotton_balls . It ' s surprising that such lush objects can be fashioned from humble cotton . Patterns are so finely calibrated and hues of burgundy , indigo and saffron so sonorous the textiles look heavily textured . Taken together the exhibitions evoke a culture in some ways richer than our own . Like other peoples we have had the arrogance to call &quot; primitive , &quot; Indonesians manifest a mentality innocent_of our myriad mental pigeonholes . The concept of dualism is strong in the archipelago , but otherwise practical life and myth are equally alive and real . The categories we use to separate the arts from one another and denigrate them to the status of fictive entertainment seem nonexistent . They live vividly blended and equal . * UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History , to April 9 , closed Monday and Tuesday ( 310 ) 825-4361 .</TEXT>
