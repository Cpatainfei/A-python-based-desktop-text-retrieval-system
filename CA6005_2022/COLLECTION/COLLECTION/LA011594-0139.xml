   <HEADLINE> ATTACKS THAT BOMBED OCCURRED 49 YEARS AGO ; WORLD_WAR_II : EXPLOSIVES BORNE BY PAPER BALLOONS DRIFTED ALL THE WAY FROM JAPAN TO VENTURA COUNTY , BUT CAUSED NO DAMAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t exactly a day of infamy in Ventura County -- hardly anyone knew what happened . But 49 years ago today -- Jan . 15 , 1945 -- the winds of war brought the first of up_to three spectacularly unsuccessful and almost unnoticed Japanese assaults on Ventura County . The attacks were carried_out not by enemy submarines , or even by long-distance bombers . These bombs came_by balloon -- paper balloons -- sent all_the way from Japan . Except for putting_up some defensive gun_emplacements , Ventura County saw little action for most of World_War_II . But in the early part of 1945 , Fugo balloon bomb attacks were recorded in the county . The first created a crater in the dry bed of the Santa Clara River near Saticoy on Jan . 15 . Two days later , an entire balloon was found in Moorpark , still containing untriggered incendiary_bombs but missing the 33-pound anti-personnel bomb carried by the balloons . Remnants of a third balloon bomb were found Feb . 21 in Oxnard . The balloon found in Moorpark may have been the same one that dropped the explosive on the Santa Clara riverbed , according to Richard Senate , a_Thousand Oaks-based historian who specializes in Ventura County ' s past . &quot; It ' s probably the only time anyone could actually say that the war came_to Ventura County , &quot; Senate said . &quot; These balloons were very ingeniously designed devices on the drawing board . Luckily for us , they didn ' t perform well in real life. &quot; The Japanese attack on the county wasn ' t revealed at the time , Senate and others said . Local news media agreed with government officials to squelch reporting of the incident to prevent the Japanese from knowing whether their unassuming weapons actually made_it to American shores . &quot; It wasn ' t until 1947 did we see any kind of news_reports about the balloons , &quot; Senate said . &quot; By then , people were getting_on_with their lives and didn ' t really seem to care too_much about the incident. &quot; No other landings in Southern California were recorded , although remnants of a balloon were found floating about 60 miles west of San Pedro . The balloons , about 70 feet high and 30 feet in diameter , were first launched from Japan in November , 1944 . The idea , according to Tom Crouch , chairman of the Smithsonian Institution ' s Department of Aeronautics in Washington , was to start hundreds of forest_fires in California and throughout the Pacific Northwest . Designed to ride the swift west-to-east high-altitude jet_stream , the estimated 10 # 000 balloons launched by the Japanese army malfunctioned by the hundreds . Crouch said it ' s possible that only one in 10 of the devices made_it across the Pacific , to places as far-flung as Alaska and Mexico . An estimated 355 of the airborne bombs were credited with reaching U.S. territory , some getting as far inland as Michigan and Texas . &quot; They wanted to set the Northwest on_fire , &quot; Crouch said . &quot; It was a desperation move . They wanted to strike back at us for our aerial bombing raids. &quot; Both Crouch and Bert Webber , an Oregon-based historian who has written four books on the subject , agree that the balloon launches were one of the last gasps of the weakened Japanese war machine . Webber said that despite their designers ' intention of wreaking wide devastation , the bombs are known to have caused only six fatalities among U.S. civilians . On May 5 , 1945 , a woman and five children on a church picnic in Oregon became the only known victims when they approached a downed balloon and its 33-pound bomb exploded unexpectedly . The balloons themselves were made of paper and glued together with potato paste . The air envelope was filled with hydrogen and an elaborate system of ballast weights linked to a barometer managed the device in flight . When the balloon would lose altitude , Webber said , a small explosive_device -- about the size of a shotgun_shell -- would fire and a ballast weight would be released , allowing the balloon to resume its normal operating altitude -- about 38 # 000 feet . A typical crossing took two to three days , he said . Webber said the balloon bomb attacks would have been stepped_up by the Japanese had the American forces not started even more intensive aerial bombing over Japan with B-29 Superfortress bombers . &quot; There ' s evidence indicating that they were ready to launch even larger balloons with larger bomb loads , &quot; Webber said . &quot; What stopped them was our B-29 raids over Japan . It literally crushed their ability to make the things. &quot; For Senate , however , the balloon bombs -- despite their significant failure rate -- showed the resourcefulness of the Japanese military . &quot; They used Japanese schoolgirls to construct these things using non-strategic materials such_as paper and potato paste , &quot; Senate said . &quot; For very little money they were essentially making unguided missiles. &quot;</TEXT>
