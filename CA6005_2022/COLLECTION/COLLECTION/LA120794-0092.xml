   <HEADLINE> VENTURA REJECTS CAP ON POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Ventura City_Council has issued a resounding &quot; No &quot; to campaign contribution limits , defeating by 4 to 2 a proposal to cap political donations at $ 100 . &quot; A lot of council_members have received special_interest dollars and have voted against those special_interest dollars time and again , &quot; said Councilman Gregory L . Carson , arguing that limits are unnecessary because contributions do not buy votes . The proposal came from Councilman Steve Bennett , who raised more_than $ 20 # 000 for his 1993 council campaign while refusing any donation above $ 100 . Councilman Gary Tuttle joined Bennett Monday in voting for the proposal , and Councilman Jack Tingstrom was absent . The other four council_members gave a myriad of reasons for their opposition to the idea , including the disadvantage it would give first-time candidates who need money to build name recognition . Others said the proposal would unnecessarily hamstring the voting process . &quot; The electoral process is something we should be very careful about messing with because it ' s a key to our freedom , &quot; Mayor Tom Buford said . The proposal garnered considerable support from the audience , with speaker after speaker exhorting the council to approve the caps and restore confidence in public officials . &quot; Voters are tired_of the perception that politicians are selling their votes to the highest bidders , &quot; said Joy Kobayashi , a Ventura resident , adding that with contribution limits &quot; people can once again feel that they make a difference. &quot; &quot; I think campaign contributions bring council_members further away from the citizens who support them , &quot; said Elaina Fletcher , a resident who is spearheading a recall effort against Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures . The recall petition states , in part , that Measures breached conflict_of_interest rules by vocally supporting a land-swap proposal from builder Ron Hertel , who is Measures ' friend , former business associate and largest single campaign contributor . Measures denies that any of those factors influenced her enthusiasm for Hertel ' s project , which failed this past summer for lack of council support . Measures and Fletcher have been_on less-than-cordial terms since Fletcher announced her recall campaign this summer , but the two had never clashed in public . Monday , however , Measures took time from the hearing to defend her voting record against Fletcher ' s allegations and to threaten Fletcher with a lawsuit if she continues to make such charges . &quot; You are liable , and you may find yourself in court , &quot; a grim-faced Measures warned from the dais . &quot; I find it appalling that I have been accused of things that are absolutely false . . . . Less than one-tenth of my ( campaign ) money came from developers , and if 99 % of it came from developers , it would not make an ounce of difference. &quot; As other council_members smothered grins of amusement , Measures and Fletcher continued a tete-a-tete for about five minutes , until Buford cut them off to resume the debate on the contribution limits . Bennett ' s proposal would have banned political contributions of more_than $ 100 by individuals , businesses or political action groups . The contribution limit would have extended_to any group formed to support or oppose City_Council candidates .</TEXT>
