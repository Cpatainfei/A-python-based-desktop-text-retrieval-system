   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : 5 SCENARIOS FOR 1995 -- AND TIPS FOR INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wanted : A winning investment formula for 1995 . The near-term is looking_like a stalemate to many Wall Streeters , who figure the markets may remain in a mode of backing and filling while waiting for the next Federal_Reserve_Board interest-rate hike , probably in November . The more important issue is what happens after that . As some investors look ahead to 1995 , they are increasingly intrigued both with the possibilities and potential pitfalls for stocks , bonds and short-term cash_accounts . With long-term bond yields already at 28-month highs , what if the Fed actually succeeds in engineering a &quot; soft landing &quot; for the economy ? Could bond yields tumble ? What if economic_growth remains strong in ' 95 and inflation zooms ? Would the markets find that a deadly combo ? And what if , despite all_of the current evidence to the contrary , the surprise in ' 95 is that the economy sinks into recession ? Financial markets would probably play_out very differently under each of these scenarios . Here ' s a look_at five scripts for the economy in ' 95 , and how investors might structure portfolios accordingly : * A soft landing . This is the most optimistic bet_on Wall_Street today . It assumes that the Fed raises short-term interest_rates two more times at most , that real economic_growth moderates from the current 4 % range to about 2.5 % in ' 95 , and that bond yields level_off or fall_back . Executives of some of the nation ' s biggest companies , meeting last week under the auspices of the Business Council , indicated their faith in a soft landing by projecting 2.6 % economic_growth in 1995 . They also expect the federal funds rate , a key short-term interest_rate , to rise from 4.75 % now to 5.5 % in 1995 . But long-term rates should hold steady , the council says . If they ' re right , bonds are a great buy today , Wall Streeters say . With 30-year Treasury_bonds yielding just under 8 % currently , and many corporate_bonds yielding nearly 9 % , the after-inflation return on long-term bonds is 5 % to 6 % if inflation stays around 3 % . &quot; There haven ' t been a lot of times in U.S. history when you ' ve been able to earn 5 % real returns , &quot; says Jack Kallis , manager of the Met Life / State Street Government_Securities bond fund in Boston . John Williams , economist at Bankers Trust in New York , is even more optimistic : He thinks slower growth and modest inflation will allow 30-year T-bond yields to fall to 7.25 % in ' 95 , giving bond owners a capital_gain on top of interest earnings . For stocks , meanwhile , a soft landing would probably be the best possible scenario . Corporate earnings would continue to advance , while investors would no longer face the threat of ever-rising interest_rates . The bull_market could conceivably resume . * Strong growth / low inflation . This is what we ' ve enjoyed so far this year , and the only real winners have been investors who have dis- invested -- that is , people who have stashed cash_in money_market funds or other short-term accounts , reaping the rewards of rising short-term interest_rates . If economic_growth stays strong in 1995 , it ' s a sure bet that the Fed will continue to push short-term interest_rates up sharply . Money_market fund yields , now around 4.3 % on average , could approach 6 % by late-1995 if the Fed raises rates another 1.5 to 2 points . So keeping hefty assets in short-term accounts would be a winning plan in ' 95 , if you think the economy isn ' t going_to slow soon . But if inflation remains moderate even though growth is strong , must long-term interest_rates continue rising as well ? Some pros don ' t think so . They see a &quot; flat yield curve &quot; on the horizon : That is , short rates go higher , but long rates stay level or decline . The result would be that short rates could nearly match long rates by late ' 95 , or even exceed them . That has been a fairly common toward the end of economic booms . &quot; I think there will be an unmistakable tendency for the yield curve to flatten and eventually invert &quot; next year , says Anthony Karydakis , economist at First Chicago Capital Markets . The trick then would be to ride short rates up , then lock_in long yields when it appears that rates overall have peaked . But such timing is no easy feat , naturally . Art Steinmetz , manager of the Oppenheimer Strategic Income bond fund in New York , argues that investors who expect the Fed to keep pushing_up short rates in 1995 should be in no hurry to grab long-term bonds . He is dubious that long rates can decline while short rates are rising , even if inflation remains tame . Historically , &quot; long-term bonds cannot rally until the Fed is done tightening , &quot; Steinmetz says . As for U.S. stocks , strong growth and much higher short rates in 1995 might mean a repeat of ' 94 . Some stocks would be driven by rising corporate earnings , but overall the market would be fighting a vicious head wind . Note , however , that many foreign markets might not face the same rate pressures , and could thrive . * Strong growth / higher inflation . It ' s probably fair to say that most investors don ' t believe inflation can surge dramatically in the ' 90s , because so_much is working against higher prices : mainly , the forces of global competition and gains in productivity . But what if those forces are overestimated ? And how much is too_much inflation , anyway ? Many economists expect only a moderate increase in inflation in 1995 . The Business Council concurs , estimating that consumer prices will rise 3.3 % next year , as opposed to 2.7 % this year . The question is whether investors have become so paranoid about inflation that even a 3.3 % rate -- or at least , the first signs of that kind of rate -- might cause much more dislocation in markets . Michael Ivanovitch , economist at MSI Global in New York , sees &quot; 12 months of strong growth and accelerating inflation &quot; ahead , and continuing bear_markets in_stocks and bonds as well . At Prudential Securities , economist Richard Rippe also worries about the propensity for inflation to surprise . He now projects that U.S. consumer prices will be rising at a 3.5 % to 4 % annual rate by late-1995 as the global economy expands , commodity prices climb and labor_markets tighten . &quot; The risks in the inflation outlook ( are ) more on the the upside than the downside , &quot; Rippe warns , especially if labor costs begin to rise as companies compete more aggressively to attract workers . If you expect inflation shocks in 1995 , you would probably want to steer clear of bonds now , even though the inflation &quot; premium &quot; in yields is arguably already high . Likewise , though some companies would undoubtedly benefit from higher prices -- commodity producers , for example -- stock-picking would also be a difficult game . The only clear winners with strong growth and higher inflation would be &quot; cash &quot; investments like money funds , and perhaps gold and real_estate . But foreign stock_markets might also do_well , especially in the case of commodity-producing smaller countries . * Slow growth / higher inflation . Remember &quot; stagflation &quot; ? That was the term used to describe the U.S. economy of the late-1970s , when growth was slow but inflation was high and rising . Few Wall Streeters expect a repeat of stagflation in the ' 90s . The late- ' 70s case was primarily a result of the oil-price shock of that period , as oil exporters demanded higher prices , slowing many nations ' growth even as they paid more for energy . But some market bears say stagflation is a real possibility for the United States in 1995 and 1996 . Charles LaLoggia , who writes the Special Situation Report market newsletter in Rochester , N.Y. , argues that inflation is mostly a function of how much money the Fed has pumped into the economy in prior years . He believes that the Fed kept interest_rates too low for too long in 1992 and 1993 , setting the stage for higher prices as excess dollars now make their way into &quot; real &quot; things like cars , machine_tools , real_estate , etc . Thus , LaLoggia says , even though the Fed will probably succeed in slowing the economy with higher interest_rates next year , inflation will not be easily squashed . That will induce the Fed to go overboard , pushing short rates from 4.75 % now to at least 7.5 % by late-1995 , he says . Result : Long-term bond yields will shoot to at least 9 % , LaLoggia says , and U.S. stocks will crash . &quot; Cash &quot; and gold will be king . * Recession . You ' d be hard-pressed to find a Wall_Street pro who believes there ' s much chance of outright recession beginning before late-1995 , and most economists doubt we ' ll have to worry about the R-word before mid-1996 . Historically , recessions are brought_on when the Fed raises interest_rates so high that economic_growth halts . So far , the Fed ' s five increases in short-term rates , from 3 % to 4.75 % , haven ' t appeared to slow business_activity except in the housing arena . But what if the U.S. economy suddenly cracks early in 1995 , and recession begins to look imminent ? By then , the stock_market would most likely be_well into a bear phase , as investors would be expecting a slump in corporate earnings ahead . So if you fear recession by mid-1995 , you would n ' t want to be a buyer of U.S. stocks now . One usual side_effect of recession , of course , is that interest_rates begin to decline again . So short-term cash_accounts would quickly lose their luster , if recession looms . And the hot investment , once again , would be bonds , as investors would rush to lock_in yields . &quot; If you think there ' s going_to be a recession soon , &quot; says Bankers Trust ' s Williams , &quot; you should be buying bonds like crazy. &quot;</TEXT>
