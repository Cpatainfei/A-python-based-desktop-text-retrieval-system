   <TEXT> * Milton Viorst ' s column , &quot; A Witch Hunt in the Name of Allah &quot; ( Commentary , July 19 ) , is so filled with ill-defined terms , misstatements of fact and distortions about Islam it is hard to know where to begin in reply . Viorst throws around the usual terms , such_as &quot; fundamentalist , &quot; &quot; fanatic &quot; and &quot; extremist , &quot; often used by those in opposition to Islamic participation in political decision-making . I am sure that if pressed , Viorst would have a hard_time defining these terms without defining practicing Muslims . That lack of definition is at the heart of most attacks on Islam . Pundits such_as Viorst divide the Islamic world into two camps . &quot; Moderate &quot; Muslims are those who shut_up , accept the wholesale Westernization of their societies , and acquiesce to the perpetual authoritarian rule of Western-oriented regimes . The &quot; fundamentalist &quot; Muslims are those who speak out against this process and try to do something about it . Since peaceful dissent of the type Americans take_for granted is largely banned in these areas , a frustrated and misguided minority of Muslim activists react with un-Islamic acts of violence , giving writers like Viorst more ammunition for their smear campaigns . Viorst and his fellow alarmists also like to claim that &quot; fundamentalist &quot; Muslims are only using religion as a path to political power . They say this as if there were any Muslim scholars or thinkers throughout the 14 centuries since the Prophet Mohammed ( peace be upon him ) who advised separating Islamic principles and morality from politics . Until the rise of repressive post-colonial regimes , even the most corrupt rulers of Muslim peoples did not advocate this separation . It was only with the power and support of the Western and former Eastern blocs that this division began to take_place . Those groups and individuals who adopted some form of foreign ideology were promoted as proxies in the Muslim world . Those who wished to hold_on to their cultural and religious traditions were suppressed . The Islamic reawakening ' s aim is not , as Viorst claims , &quot; to stifle any challenge to orthodoxy , any loosening of the cultural status quo. &quot; Instead , committed Muslims , who have witnessed the tragic consequences of secularism , communism and materialism in Muslim lands , seek to re-establish a society based on the unchanging Islamic values of justice , equality and mutual consultation . The issue of Islam ' s supposed hostility to democracy is also a favorite of writers like Viorst who claim Islamists will &quot; suppress democracy as soon as they take over. &quot; In fact , when Muslim groups have been given the chance to take_part in multi-party politics in places like Jordan , Pakistan , Malaysia , Yemen and Turkey , they proved to be able campaigners who accept the outcome of elections . It is only when Islam is locked_out of the political_system that problems occur . IBRAHIM HOOPER Communications Director Council on American-Islamic Relations Washington</TEXT>
