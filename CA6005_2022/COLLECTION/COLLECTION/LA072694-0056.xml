   <TEXT> * Although not of the same cosmic significance as the Simpson trial , the comet that collided into Jupiter had to be the story of the week ( &quot; Jupiter Takes Huge Blow From Comet , &quot; July 19 ) . Especially interesting -- although , again , not quite as interesting as the O.J. Simpson trial -- was the fact that one comet fragment created a plume with a width ( 9 # 600 miles ) greater than the diameter of the Earth ; I found this to be a precautionary item worth noting . Because , I feel , it would be particularly unpleasant to live through such a plume , I propose we not procrastinate , but immediately begin construction of three large baseball_gloves to orbit above the Earth ; attached_to each glove would be a long rope for hauling , which would allow_for easy fielding by a NASA Shuttle craft . This plan would also provide great cost-saving advantages over other messy solutions such_as nuclear missiles or photon torpedoes -- which I studied in junior_college . Once completed , we could then rest easy , and again focus our attention on the things that really matter , such_as the Simpson trial -- did I mention the Simpson trial ? RAY ROBBINS Los Angeles * Forty years ago , Immanuel Velikovsky proposed cataclysmic collisions between plants and comets in his books &quot; Worlds in Collision &quot; and &quot; Earth in Upheaval. &quot; His theories were ridiculed by the orthodox scientific community . Though many of his interpretations and details were not right , his concepts seem to be verified by what we saw on Jupiter . Isn ' t it time to reopen the books on Velikovsky ? ERNO S . DANIEL Santa Barbara * The old saying , the sky is going_to fall , came true finally . Luckily it is falling on Jupiter , not on our Earth . SANTOSH KUMAR Downey</TEXT>
