   <HEADLINE> CAR_BOMB IN GAZA KILLS A LEADER OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A booby-trap car_bomb killed a leader of an extremist Islamic faction Wednesday , and armed supporters poured into the streets vowing vengeance against Israel . There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion , the first such incident in Gaza since Palestinian self-rule began in May . But a top Islamic militant spiritual_leader blamed Israel for the blast , pointing to a threat by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin to hunt_down military_leaders of the Muslim movement after a deadly bus bomb in Tel Aviv last month . Hani Abed , 35 , died hours after a bomb exploded in the trunk of his car when he opened it in front of a college where he taught engineering in Khan Yunis . Abed was a leader of Islamic Jihad , an extremist group opposed to reconciliation with Israel that was banned during Israel ' s occupation of the Gaza Strip . Protests erupted in Gaza City ' s Sheik Radwan neighborhood , where residents raised guns and chanted &quot; Death to Israel ! &quot; Islamic Jihad accused Israel and the Palestinian police of assassinating Abed . Abed also had disputes with Hamas , the main fundamentalist group in Gaza , as well as a conflict with cousins over land .</TEXT>
