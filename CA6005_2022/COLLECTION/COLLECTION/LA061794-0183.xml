   <HEADLINE> KOREANS IN JAPAN TARGETS OF HOSTILITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She was riding the morning train to school when the middle-aged Japanese man came_up behind her and slashed her traditional Korean uniform . She kept her mouth shut because she was afraid he would attack her more if she screamed . But the 11th-grader could not hide her terror as she described her experience on national television Wednesday . &quot; I was so scared , &quot; she recalled . &quot; I couldn ' t say anything. &quot; Her mother , also interviewed , declared in anguish , &quot; I ' m worried that the next time it will be a threat to my daughter ' s life. &quot; As tensions escalate over the international standoff with North_Korea over inspection of its nuclear facilities , the fallout is affecting a vulnerable target in Japan : the 700 # 000 Koreans here , especially the estimated 200 # 000 supporters of the Communist regime of Kim Il Sung . The pro-Pyongyang Koreans have been thrust into the spotlight over claims they supply as much as $ 600 million in money and materiel that may have helped North_Korea ' s nuclear program . Japanese police are bearing_down_on them as possible terrorist agents ; some Japanese worry they may carry_out Kim ' s threatened &quot; declaration of war &quot; in Japan should the U.N. Security_Council later this month approve sanctions , which Tokyo has pledged to support . The fear and distrust of Koreans here has been heightened by sensational reports of 600 North_Korean spies in Japan , of mysterious radio_waves broadcast to Japan from Pyongyang every night to transmit marching orders , of secret money flows and of elaborate espionage rings . As a result , some Japanese are using the crisis to give_vent to anti-Korean feelings through a growing number of hate crimes and protests . More_than isolated events , the harassment , Koreans say , underscores the entrenched animosity they have experienced since their people began migrating -- or were conscripted -- for work after Japan colonized Korea in 1910 . Most Koreans arrived here between 1920 and 1944 and their offspring have stayed through postwar repatriation waves . Since the 1988 Seoul Olympics , their image and status in Japan have improved considerably , Korean officials say . Korean traditions -- from language study to dining on their spicy foods , such_as pickled vegetables known as kimchi -- are gaining wider acceptance in Japan . But Koreans say they still suffer discrimination in jobs and housing , education and marriage . Choe Kwan Ik , spokesman for Chongryun , the pro-Pyongyang residents group in Japan , said : &quot; Historically speaking , in Japanese society there has been a strong bias and prejudice toward Koreans . Each time something happens on the Korean_peninsula , you will see this kind of aggravation. &quot; Since April , at least 20 students -- mostly female -- attending pro-Pyongyang schools in Japan have been terrorized by skirt slashings , name-calling , beatings and theft , Chongryun said . A Korean boy in Osaka was riding his bike home when five Japanese students threw rocks at him and shouted , &quot; We will kill Koreans ! &quot; The group also reports a rise in anti-Korean graffiti . Last week , about 1 # 400 Kyoto police raided a North_Korean school and 26 Chongryun offices and homes on the pretext that the group had failed to notify the city about a land deal . After a 10-hour search , police admitted they had erred and the transaction had been properly reported . But that did not stop officials from confiscating boxes of documents that Chongryun says detail the group ' s finances and personnel . Although Japanese authorities have denied having political motivations and say officers made an honest mistake , &quot; it ' s quite apparent that the police wanted inside_information about our organization , &quot; Choe said . &quot; It ' s quite obvious that they are trying to suppress our organization. &quot; Privately , some Japanese officials say the alleged threat posed by Koreans here is exaggerated . On the controversial issue of remittances of money and materiel to Pyongyang , for instance , Japanese sources say the amount seems to have dropped recently . The widely reported figure of remittances of $ 600 million to $ 800 million is based on a 1990 estimate of 15 # 000 visitors each year to Pyongyang hand-carrying $ 30 # 000 per person , in addition to bank transfers and other financial_aid . But Japanese sources say the latest figures indicate the remittances may be as little as $ 100 million . They speculate that Koreans in Japan have reduced sums they are sending home because of nervousness over the political furor , the recessionary pinch in their own finances and a reported order from Pyongyang not to send money directly to relatives but to the government . Chongryun itself says the contributions amount to only $ 23 million and that the number of visitors to Pyongyang has dropped from 8 # 691 in 1992 to 5 # 157 last year . &quot; Our businessmen have been hard hit by the collapse of the ( Japanese ) economy , &quot; Choe said . &quot; Who dares send money free_of charge ? &quot; Japanese economic sources also say that Koreans in Japan have in the last year drastically reduced their business investment , which had provided critical machinery and equipment to Pyongyang . Japanese officials are divided on how great a security risk Chongryun is . One police source said Japanese radical organizations pose a greater threat than Chongryun , whose members , when compared with the group ' s founders , are younger , less nationalistic and more assimilated . But others dispute that assessment and say Chongryun members will be forced to cooperate in acts of terrorism , because Pyongyang holds their relatives hostage in North_Korea . No one knows that better than individuals like the frail woman who showed_up earlier this year at a Tokyo meeting that aimed to aid North_Koreans with stranded relatives . In a tearful interview , the woman , who gave only her Japanese surname of Yamada , said her elder brother , a biology professor , had repatriated to North_Korea in 1961 at age 23 . Dazzled by Pyongyang ' s propaganda depicting North_Korea as a paradise for Koreans , he was one of more_than 90 # 000 Koreans who repatriated from Japan , mostly in the 1960s . &quot; He wanted to be a bridge between Japan and Korea , &quot; Yamada said . &quot; But once he arrived he found there were no microscopes , no books . There was no milk for newborn babies. &quot; Over the next few years , his parents , at his request , sent him -- via the Chongryun organization -- science books , research equipment , clothes and tens of thousands of dollars in cash , Yamada said . But six years after he left , they got their last letter from him , saying , &quot; I can ' t live like this any longer. &quot; The demands for money from Chongryun continued , Yamada said . &quot; They would promise if we donated money , my parents would be permitted to go_to North_Korea and visit and his treatment would improve. &quot; And after he stopped writing , officials told them they would investigate his case if donations continued . Eventually , Yamada and her family learned he had been sent to &quot; something like a prison &quot; and died . Now she is driven by a promise to her dying mother that she would search for his wife and three children , still believed alive in North_Korea . The discrimination that led Yamada ' s brother to repatriate to North_Korea still exists , Koreans say , noting a history of ugly incidents . In 1990 , scandals involving Korean-owned pinball parlors prompted an outbreak of hostility ; there were earlier problems , after the November , 1987 , bombing of a Korea Air jet by North_Korean agents off the coast of Burma ( now Myanmar ) . Such harassment dates to 1923 , when the Great Kanto Earthquake set_off rumors that Koreans were poisoning water_supplies . The tales instigated mob violence that left 6 # 000 Koreans dead . Koreans here say they also suffer social and economic discrimination . Although more big Japanese companies are hiring Koreans -- including the Bank of Tokyo , trading giant Mitsubishi and Yamaichi Securities Co . -- most still work in small businesses , such_as restaurants or pinball parlors , because they cannot easily get jobs in major Japanese firms . Reiko Lee , 38 , said she never personally felt discrimination because she attended Korean schools in Japan and generally associated with other Koreans . But she said she has no expectation that her three children can land jobs with major Japanese firms or enter top Japanese universities . The Ministry of Education still does not allow graduates of Korean schools in Japan to enter national universities . Lee laments that her Korean education at the Chongryun-sponsored school taught her ideology but few useful skills for succeeding in Japanese life . &quot; I feel I am an incomplete person , &quot; she said . Many Koreans also complain that they are ineligible for pensions , voting_rights and employment as public_school teachers and government workers . Discrimination is not the only reason : Japanese citizenship is a requirement and most Koreans do not naturalize , even though eligible to do so . Legally , the Japanese government settled the major outstanding issue for Koreans here in 1991 when it extended the right for their people -- many technically stateless -- to live permanently in Japan under Korean citizenship . That status had been granted only to first-generation Koreans , not their descendants . ( Unlike the United States , citizenship is automatically granted only to those with a Japanese parent. ) Although some Korean activists are pressing_on other issues , such_as the right for non-citizens to vote , others are being lulled into the increasingly comfortable life in Japan . As one indication , more Koreans are naturalizing as citizens : 7 # 698 in 1993 , compared to 4 # 759 in 1989 .
