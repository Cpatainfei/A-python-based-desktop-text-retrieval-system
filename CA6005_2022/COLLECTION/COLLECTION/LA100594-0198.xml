   <TEXT> Numbers roll_off Bob Sandelman ' s tongue faster than he can flip through his latest stack of statistics on what Americans think_of fast-food and pizza places . About 96 % of those living_in metropolitan areas go_to such eateries at least once a month , he says . Altogether , they average 12 trips a month for breakfast , lunch , dinner or snacks . That means that nearly everybody , he says , is getting food from McDonald ' s or Domino ' s or some_other chain every two or three days . &quot; People have no time for something so basic as eating , &quot; Sandelman said . &quot; With dual-income households , people are going_out to purchase ready-to-eat meals , and the need for speed and convenience is paramount. &quot; Operating out of his Brea home , Sandelman has built a growing business that helps the chains , as well as sit-down family and casual restaurants , monitor and cater to the ever-changing tastes of their customers . Sandelman &amp; Associates tracks consumers ' opinions of more_than 120 national and regional fast-food chains in 49 metropolitan markets nationwide , finding_out how aware patrons are of a chain and its products and how often they stop at each chain . The company ' s consumer research is highly valued , clients say , because it targets specific metropolitan areas , polls a large sample of customers and costs less than other , less-focused surveys . In the process , Sandelman has become somewhat of a guru , opining for the national media on what people eat , where they go and with whom . Just 10 days ago , for instance , he was quoted by USA Today about the pending merger of the Arby ' s roast_beef chain and Long John Silver ' s seafood . He also studies related issues that affect the fast-food and pizza business . Last spring , for instance , he found through an extensive survey that 60 % of the nation ' s fast-food patrons favored a no-smoking policy at fast-food restaurants , while only 22 % opposed such a ban . The rest of the 6 # 230 people polled in 31 major U.S. markets had no opinion . In a smaller poll involving casual-dining chains in the Los Angeles , San Francisco and Sacramento markets , even more patrons -- 73 % -- favored a no-smoking policy in the dining_area , and a surprising 45 % wanted a ban on smoking in the bar areas as well . Those surveys came at a time when a_few fast-food chains , notably McDonald ' s and Taco Bell , said they would institute smoking bans in company-owned stores . &quot; His research gives you a pulse on what ' s happening locally , &quot; said Tom Amberger , marketing director for Wienerschnitzel Corp . in Newport Beach . &quot; It gives some top-flight information quickly , and we appreciate that. &quot; Earlier this year , Wienerschnitzel hired Sandelman to do a private survey for the company , which wanted to gauge the effectiveness of its new advertising_campaign . The nation ' s biggest hot dog chain poked_fun at itself with self-mocking ads , even referring to itself as &quot; Chez Weenie. &quot; Billboards across Southern California showed jumbo chili_dogs next to such headlines as &quot; The culinary equivalent of mud wrestling &quot; and &quot; It ' s cheap . It ' s messy . Hey , you are what you eat. &quot; Sandelman polled consumers both before the campaign was launched and after it was over . The results , Amberger said , showed that the ads made consumers more aware of Wienerschnitzel and that awareness translated into higher sales for the privately held company . &quot; People say they watch their health and they exercise , &quot; Sandelman said . &quot; But when they eat_out , they consider it a treat . They eat salads at_home and then go have fatty burgers at a Wendy ' s or McDonald ' s. &quot; With a master ' s degree in business administration , the 49-year-old Sandelman has worked_at such nationally known companies as conglomerate Procter &amp; Gamble and advertising_agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather . But the demise of another ad_agency left him without work in 1988 . &quot; Jobs in senior management then were not easy to find , &quot; he said . While looking_for work , he also took_stock of his abilities and his desire to strike_out on_his_own in an area that would be fun . He liked the food industry , and he figured he was good with details and computers . &quot; The food industry is so competitive , &quot; he said . &quot; There are new ad_campaigns every few months , new menus . It ' s always changing . I found that exciting. &quot; The constant changes also meant that fast-food chains , especially , needed a continuing stream of information about consumer reaction . The chains had lost their only inexpensive research tool when a company that had been selling local survey results gave_up that line_of_work . In 1988 , Sandelman stepped_in and , with advice from Bob Wisely , then a marketing executive for hamburger chain Carl ' s Jr. , launched his fast-track study of consumer awareness , usage and attitudes regarding fast-food restaurants . By focusing_on a local market and selling the results to the chains or their franchisees in that market , Sandelman is able to offer his quarterly reports at a low cost . For a year ' s subscription , he now charges_up to $ 12 # 000 , the amount most researchers would charge for just one report that provides similar information . For an additional fee , Sandelman adds specific questions in any survey that particular clients might want . He retains Verity Group in Fullerton to make the calls to restaurant patrons . He has also started regular consumer surveys on family-style restaurant_chains like Sizzler and Souplantation and on casual-dining chains like Red Lobster and the Olive Garden . In the past six years , Sandelman &amp; Associates has grown steadily and profitably . The company projects revenue of $ 1 million for this year , Sandelman said . Two years ago , his wife , Bev , quit her job helping Carl ' s Jr . develop branch sites to join the company . Then JoAnn Aprati was hired to help with research . &quot; We had to kick the kids out , &quot; Bev Sandelman joked about the couple ' s two grown children , &quot; so we could use their bedrooms for offices. &quot; This year , the company incorporated and hired Jeffrey T . Davis to open an office in Dallas , where he works to add more markets to the surveys and more restaurant_chain owners and franchisees to the client list . That such an operation would become successful hardly surprises Wisely , now a Carl ' s Jr . franchisee in Santa Rosa . Wisely used to work_on such surveys before joining the Carl ' s chain , and he was impressed with Sandelman and his approach . &quot; He ' s a very bright guy , &quot; Wisely said , &quot; and he has become very knowledgeable_about the business. &quot;</TEXT>
