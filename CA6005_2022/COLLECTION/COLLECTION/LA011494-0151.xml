   <TEXT> Hollywood Park is close to completing a deal to buy Pimlico Race Course , the home of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore , and Pimlico ' s sister track in Laurel , Md. , sources close to the sale said Thursday night . R.D. Hubbard , board chairman of Hollywood Park , could not be reached for comment , but Maryland sources said that the sale would leave the Inglewood track with an 80 % equity interest in Pimlico and Laurel . Hollywood Park will reportedly pay about $ 15 million for its share and assume most of the tracks ' debt , which has been reported at $ 40 million . Pimlico , the second-oldest track in the country , was opened in 1870 and has hosted the Preakness , the middle leg of racing ' s Triple_Crown , for 118 years . Pimlico is located in the heart of Baltimore , and Laurel , which opened in 1911 , is located near Washington . Since 1952 , Laurel ' s signature race has been the Washington D.C. International , once a fixture on the calendar for international grass horses but a race that has been squeezed_out of prominence by other races in the past several years . The late Frank De Francis and his partners bought Laurel in 1984 for $ 16 million and two years later acquired Pimlico for $ 30 million . Since De Francis ' death in 1989 , his son , Joseph A . De Francis , a 1982 graduate of the UCLA School_of_Law , has run the Maryland tracks , but his father ' s partners , brothers Robert T . and Tommy Manfuso , objected to the younger De Francis ' operating style and retreated from the day-to-day details . More recently , the Manfuso brothers brought the feud to a head by activating a buy-sell clause in their contract with De Francis . By next week , De Francis would have been obligated to either sell the track to the Manfusos or buy_out their interest for the same price that they offered him . Out of Hollywood Park ' s $ 15-million payment , the Manfusos are expected to receive more_than $ 8 million to complete their buy-sell agreement with De Francis . De Francis will reportedly remain as president of the tracks with a multiyear contract . The De Francis family and other shareholders will wind_up with a 20 % interest in the tracks . The Maryland tracks have struggled in recent years , and De Francis has been accused of letting the backstretch area at Pimlico deteriorate and not maintaining customer comforts at either track . According to the Manfusos , Laurel has operated at_a_loss of $ 6.7 million since 1990 . A source close to the pending Hollywood Park purchase said that Pimlico showed a profit of about $ 2 million last year , much of it the result of national television rights that the track was paid by ABC for the Preakness . There have been overlaps between the Maryland track executives and Hubbard since Hubbard ousted Marje Everett as chairman of Hollywood Park in 1991 . De Francis and Hubbard were part of different groups that sought a Texas racing license in the Dallas-Ft . Worth area . The group now planning to build a track there no longer includes Hubbard or De Francis , although Hubbard Enterprises , a private company , has a management contract with the new track . Robert T . Manfuso , who owns a small amount of stock in Hollywood Park , has been a member of Hubbard ' s board , but Manfuso recently resigned that post . Even without Texas , the Maryland deal could make the 58-year-old Hubbard the most influential track operator in the United States . Besides his stake of about 14 % in Hollywood Park , Hubbard is a majority owner of Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico , he owns a greyhound track in Portland , Ore. , and has a 60 % interest in the Woodlands , a facility that races_horses and greyhounds in Kansas City , Kan . It is not clear how the sale of Pimlico and Laurel will affect De Francis ' interest in building a track in nearby Virginia . The Maryland tracks have been one of several groups applying for racing licenses in Virginia , which currently does not have parimutuel racing . De Francis has had recent conversations with Jack Kent Cooke , owner of the Washington Redskins , about building a new football_stadium adjacent to the Laurel track . Hollywood Park ' s imminent purchase of the Maryland tracks comes_about two months after its board approved in principle the purchase of the Woodlands . Business there has fallen_off dramatically since it opened in 1989 , but Hubbard believes that by buying the Woodlands , Hollywood Park will be strategically placed for the legalization of casino gambling , which might be placed on a referendum there next fall . Hubbard plans to open a card club at Hollywood Park in February or March .</TEXT>
