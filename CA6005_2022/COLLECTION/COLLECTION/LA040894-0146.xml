   <HEADLINE> MEDICINE ; DEATH OF CANADA ' RIGHT TO DIE ' ADVOCATE TRIGGERS NEW DEBATE ; HER LEGAL BATTLE AND PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED END SPUR CHANCES FOR LEGISLATION TO PROTECT DOCTORS WHO HELP PERFORM EUTHANASIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The physician-assisted suicide of Canada ' s leading advocate of the &quot; right to die &quot; has triggered a new national debate on euthanasia and dramatically improved chances for legislation that would protect doctors who aid in the consensual death of a patient . A special committee of the Canadian Senate is scheduled to begin hearings on the issue in two weeks , and Prime_Minister Jean Chretien has promised a rare &quot; free vote &quot; on the question in Parliament , meaning members will be permitted to vote their conscience rather than follow an official party position . Opponents , including religious organizations and some medical ethicists , plan a high-profile counterattack . The Canadian Medical Assn . is also struggling with the issue and is expected to take a position at its annual meeting in Montreal in August . All of this follows the Feb . 12 death of Sue Rodriguez , 43 , in her suburban Victoria , British_Columbia , home . Rodriguez , who was in the latter stages of amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig ' s disease ) , died in the arms of a member of the Canadian Parliament after being assisted by an as yet unidentified doctor . Her death followed a long , well-publicized but unsuccessful legal battle for the right to a physician-assisted suicide . &quot; She opened the eyes of the Canadian people to the issue of how we die in this society and the options available for people with diseases like cancer and ALS , &quot; said Victoria lawyer Chris Considine , who represented Rodriguez . Surveying the chances for a legislative change in the law , Considine added : &quot; Sue lost the ( legal ) battle , but she won the war. &quot; A national poll taken within weeks of Rodriguez ' s death showed wide support for her cause among the Canadian public , with 74 % agreeing that doctors &quot; should be legally permitted to assist the death of a terminally ill patient who wants to die. &quot; Dr. Fred Lowy , director of the Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto , suggests that the numbers may be deceiving . &quot; I don ' t think anybody really knows where this is heading , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s no doubt the public sentiment in this country , and in the U.S. and Britain , is hugely in favor . . . . But a lot depends_on how you ask the question. &quot; Euthanasia opponents point to the California experience of 1992 , in which voters rejected a right-to-die measure despite early favorable polls . The question probably will not be submitted to voters here . British_Columbia member_of_Parliament Svend Robinson , who became Rodriguez ' s close friend and supporter during her court fight , tearfully described her death to reporters two days after it happened . Robinson , Parliament ' s first openly gay member and long identified with controversial causes , has introduced a bill in the House of Commons to legalize physician-assisted suicide . The more likely starting_point for any successful legislation , however , is the seven-member Senate committee , chaired by Joan Neiman , a Liberal from Ontario . The Senate is an appointed body in Canada and thus less subject_to the buffeting of politics . Neiman said the hearings set for this month will be extensive , and she is &quot; quite confident &quot; the Liberal government will use the committee report in formulating legislation . The most probable scenario for liberalization would be for Canada to follow the example of the_Netherlands , which has enacted regulations that in_effect prevent prosecution of doctors who carry_out euthanasia . Robinson , following Rodriguez ' s wishes , has refused to identify the doctor who aided in her death from an overdose of morphine and secobarbital . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are investigating , but authorities say it is unlikely anyone will be charged even if the physician is identified .</TEXT>
