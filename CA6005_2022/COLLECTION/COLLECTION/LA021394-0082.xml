   <HEADLINE> UP ALL NIGHT / HILLARY JOHNSON : LUNA-CY LURKS AT CABARET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cabaret room at LunaPark is a low-ceilinged black_box hung with red curtains and mirrors -- as well a cabaret should be . Little round_tables snuggle together . Candles smolder . &quot; I feel_like I ' m in a Turkish prison , &quot; comic Ed Kraznick says appreciatively , taking_the_stage . LunaPark is the creation of Jean-Pierre Boccara , genius of the Lhasa Club and Cafe Largo . The cabaret is just one aspect of a bi-level , avant-garde theme park that promises &quot; post-modern Mediterranean fare &quot; in the restaurant upstairs and a fully equipped dance_hall . Meanwhile , the cabaret proves to have a life of its own . &quot; Good entertainment for a nasty world , that ' s our motto , &quot; says Beth Lapides , the beehived mistress of ceremonies for Sunday night ' s &quot; Uncabaret &quot; comedy show . ( Lapides won worldwide fame on CNN last year in her unsuccessful bid for the office of First Lady. ) &quot; The week of the earthquake , we were all very bitter and very real . This is a good place for a disaster -- any disaster , &quot; she says . The Sunday show features first-timers yucking it up from handfuls of notes as well as comedy luminaries like Bobcat Goldthwait venting hysterical spleen about the existential tortures of opening for Nirvana in the nude . &quot; This is like the comedy safe house , &quot; Goldthwait declares , mid-rant , throwing his coonskin_cap to the winds . By 10 o ' clock , the Wayne Peet and Vinny Golia quartet takes_over , and Sweet Baby J ' Ai sings . If she had a coonskin_cap , she ' d chew it to bits and throw it to the winds without missing a note . On a recent Thursday night at the cabaret , an audience too cool to be entirely industry packs the house to hear writer / performer Barry Yourgrau rescue runaway sex_organs from the branches of trees and drown among a bevy of salacious mermaids . The reading was from his forthcoming story collection , &quot; The Sadness of Sex. &quot; Yourgrau is followed by guitarist Pascal Humbert ' s band Rex Voto , featuring Esther Balint , the bleak Hungarian gamin of &quot; Strangers in Paradise &quot; fame , who struts dire numbers with a country twang -- Joy Division does Nashville . If it isn ' t Berlin in the ' 30s , the cabaret at LunaPark at least offers a ribald alternative to despair in the ' 90s . &quot; The atmosphere is just about right , &quot; says actress Corinne Bohrer on her first visit to LunaPark . &quot; A little too smoky for New Age saxophonists , but comfortable for people who maybe don ' t do so many drugs any more -- a nice place to hear stories and have a_couple_of vodkas . &quot; It ' s Thursday , so I guess we ' re all people who don ' t have jobs , &quot; Bohrer adds . * Where : LunaPark , 665 N . Robertson Blvd. , West Hollywood . When : Nightly . Times and entertainment vary . &quot; Uncabaret &quot; shows Sundays at 7:30 p.m. Prices : Cover $ 5 to $ 10 depending_on entertainment . Domestic beer , $ 3.50 ; imported beer and wine , $ 4 ; well drinks , $ 4 .</TEXT>
