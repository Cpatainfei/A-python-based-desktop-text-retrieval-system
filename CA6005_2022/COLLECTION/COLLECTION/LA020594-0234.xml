   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; SANTA CLARITA TRAIN LINE TO GET 5TH STATION ; TRANSIT : METROLINK SITE ON VIA PRINCESSA WILL OPEN MONDAY . IT IS THE LATEST ADDITION IN TWO WEEKS SINCE EMERGENCY SERVICE WAS EXTENDED NORTHWARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Metrolink is preparing to open its fifth train_station in two weeks on the Santa Clarita line , which has seen ridership swell dramatically since the Jan . 17 Northridge quake crippled many Southland freeways . The Santa Clarita / Princessa station , at 19201 Via Princessa , will open Monday . It is the latest emergency station to open since Metrolink extended service north to the Antelope Valley -- opening stations in Lancaster and Palmdale on Jan . 24 . A Sylmar / San Fernando station and one at Vincent Grade in Acton also have opened on the Santa Clarita line . Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said the newest station is expected to relieve crowding at the existing Santa Clarita station . Metrolink ' s Santa Clarita line has seen its daily ridership jump from 1 # 000 before the quake to as much as 21 # 952 , a peak hit on Jan . 25 . The number of riders on the line each weekday has declined since , with Thursday ' s ridership at 9 # 819 , according to Metrolink records . Metrolink Executive_Director Richard Stanger said the extension of the Santa Clarita line to the Antelope Valley will continue for at least one year . If ridership warrants , the commuter_train service may be made permanent . For now , Hidalgo said , the only other change being considered is the addition of a third round-trip train to serve Lancaster and the other three platforms north of the permanent station in Santa Clarita . Just two trains depart from Lancaster each morning , stopping in Palmdale , Acton and , beginning Monday , at Via Princessa before continuing on the regular Santa Clarita route to downtown Los Angeles . Two trains return from downtown to the new northern Los Angeles County stations each evening . Many riders have requested a third train , Hidalgo said , particularly one that would leave Lancaster and Palmdale later in the morning than the pre-dawn departing trains . A decision about an additional train or changes in the train schedule , Hidalgo said , is not expected to be made before late next week . Trains will depart from the Via Princessa station each morning at 5:30 and 6:11 , with the ride downtown expected to take a little more_than an hour . Trains will return to the newest station at 5:07 p.m. and 6:36 p.m. The newest station , like the other emergency platforms , offers few amenities . There is a paved parking_lot with 400 spaces and a 1 # 000-foot platform . Metrolink personnel will be at the station , as they are at others , to assist riders .</TEXT>
