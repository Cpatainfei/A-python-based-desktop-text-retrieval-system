   <HEADLINE> MARKETABLE SKILLS TESTED IN QUEST TO BAG A VICTORY ; CONTEST : GROCERY BAGGERS COMPETE ON SPEED , TECHNIQUE AND STYLE IN ANAHEIM . STATE CHAMPION WILL BE NAMED TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Friday was the day James Bayly had been waiting for . The 18-year-old grocery bagger for Ralphs in Villa Park had been training for weeks and felt primed to do_well in the California Grocers Assn. ' s Bag-Off Contest . But when Bayly of Orange stepped_up to the stage and looked_at the 44 items he was supposed to stuff into paper_bags as quickly and neatly as possible , he felt a sudden wave of panic . The boxes of cereal and crackers , cans of soup , toothpaste , toilet_paper and other items were all mixed_up . It turns_out that organizers of the contest at the Anaheim Convention Center had purposely arranged the items differently from the diagram they had earlier provided the 17 state finalists to study . &quot; It really threw me , &quot; Bayly said of the last-minute switch . &quot; But I just used common_sense and that got me through . Common_sense tells you not to put cans on top of bread. &quot; In the end , the switch didn ' t hurt the Cal State Fullerton student ' s chances . He was among the nine contestants who made_it through Friday ' s preliminary round and will compete to become state champion when the contest resumes today . &quot; The way most of them had studied the diagram , they could have bagged those groceries in their sleep , &quot; said event coordinator Vicki Berends . &quot; We changed the items around slightly but that made_it more challenging . It slowed things down , but this helps them prepare_for the nationals. &quot; The winner of the final will be awarded $ 1 # 000 and will go_on to compete in February national bag-off held_in Las Vegas . Previous winners have appeared on David Letterman ' s network variety_show . The contestants are judged in speed , bag-building technique , number of bags used , weight distribution , style , attitude and appearance . Friday ' s event resembled a rowdy pep_rally , with each contestant being cheered wildly by co-workers , friends and relatives . Many in the audience blew horns and waved pompons and signs . In the midst of the pandemonium was a Joan Rivers look-alike , Dee Dee Hanson , who kept the proceedings moving at a swift pace between rounds , interviewing bashful contestants and telling supermarket-related jokes . The group supporting 17-year-old David Davey , representing Hughes market in Los Angeles , was the largest cheering section . They waved large signs bearing the likeness of their contestant . Before the contest , Davey admitted that the chaos had him feeling a little jittery but he said , &quot; I know I ' m going_to win. &quot; And true_to his word , Davey was among the top nine finishers , despite some dissatisfaction with his performance . &quot; I did my best but they switched things around , &quot; he said . &quot; I think I could have done better. &quot; Linda Zepeda , a 19-year-old bagger at the Alpha Beta store in Indio , didn ' t make_it to the final round , but she was proud to have been one of only three women to qualify for the state competition . &quot; Girls can bag as_good_as guys , &quot; Zepeda said . &quot; I always bag fast . It ' s just the way I am . I ' m very active and like to go fast. &quot; Like many of her colleagues , Zepeda said she enjoys her job because she gets_to meet a lot of people , even though some of them aren ' t always in the best of moods . &quot; If you work in the morning , people are very friendly , &quot; she said . &quot; But at night , they ' ve had a long day , and they can be real grouchy. &quot; Contestant Doug Favelo , from Reedley , was among the winners and wondered what his customers would think if he packed their groceries as fast as he packed_on Friday . &quot; I think it would be fun to try it , &quot; he said . &quot; But I think they might be frightened off. &quot;</TEXT>
