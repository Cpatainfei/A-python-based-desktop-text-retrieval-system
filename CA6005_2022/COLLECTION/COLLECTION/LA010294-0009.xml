   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : ' LIKE A BEAUTIFUL DANCE ' ; A DECADE LATER , GEARY AND FRANCIS STEP INTO OLD ROLES WITH NEW HABITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charley Brown ' s near Universal Studios may seem like just another place to eat_in the Valley . But back in the summer of 1992 , when it was still Reuben ' s , the restaurant was the setting for one of the most significant lunches in recent soap-opera history . It was there that Tony Geary and Genie Francis , who 10 years earlier had left their phenomenally popular roles as Luke and Laura Spencer on ABC ' s &quot; General Hospital , &quot; met to catch_up . They had seen each other only twice in the intervening years . He had appeared in features , TV movies and stage productions at the Los Angeles Theatre Center and elsewhere after departing his Emmy-winning role on &quot; General Hospital. &quot; She had been featured in the miniseries &quot; North and South &quot; ( Books I and II ) and the series &quot; Bare Essence , &quot; and was fresh from a two-year stint as incest victim Ceara Connor on ABC ' s New York-based &quot; All My Children. &quot; Geary already had returned to &quot; General Hospital &quot; in 1991 , playing Luke ' s look-alike cousin Bill Eckert . ABC , anxious for an almost certain ratings bonanza -- the couple ' s 1981 wedding remains the highest-rated soap event ever , watched by 14 million viewers and garnering a 52 share -- had been pursuing Francis for a year . But the actress had been reluctant to call a halt to a burgeoning New York theater career to rejoin the soap . At that fateful lunch , though , Geary recalls , &quot; We talked_about playing Luke and Laura again . We knew that sooner or later we wanted to work together again . We became very excited about the idea. &quot; Adds Francis : &quot; We did an improv together to see if those people were still in us . That lunch made me feel_like this could be a wonderful thing , a fulfilling acting challenge , and that I shouldn ' t turn my back on it. &quot; Accordingly , at last year ' s Daytime Emmy Awards came the announcement that Luke and Laura , whose romance had landed them on the cover of Newsweek a_few weeks before their wedding , would indeed be returning to &quot; General Hospital. &quot; And return they did , on Oct . 29 . They were the owners of a diner in British_Columbia , a continent away from the show ' s fictional Upstate New York setting of Port Charles . And they ' re parents of a 10-year-old son , Lucky ( Jonathan Jackson ) . As it turns_out , the path back to Port Charles required as much maneuvering off screen as on . &quot; There had to be new writers and a great story , &quot; says Geary , 46 , who cites battles he had had with the show ' s writers over the continuing , confusing changes they made in Eckert ' s character . &quot; Primarily , it was , ' Let ' s get a story that ' s good , one that we believe_in . With Luke and Laura , the stakes have to be very high -- there has to be an adversary . These aren ' t characters who sit around talking_about their relationship . These are eccentric characters who drive the plot . &quot; We said , ' We need a heavyweight ( writer ) , ' and we got one in Claire Labine . She ' s brilliant . They worked_on the story for months. &quot; Labine , a multiple Emmy Award-winning writer-producer who created the now-departed &quot; Ryan ' s Hope , &quot; was brought_on board after ABC dismissed the previous &quot; General Hospital &quot; writing staff . Once taping actually began , &quot; There was plenty of nervous tension , &quot; says the 31-year-old Francis of the role she first played_at age 14 . &quot; I was scared . It was important to do_it right . I was afraid people would say , ' Luke and Laura ? So what. ' But I was welcomed back warmly . I was surprised at how comfortable it felt. &quot; Moving from Bill to Luke provided a different sort of comfort for Geary . &quot; People laugh when I say this , &quot; he says , laughing now himself , &quot; but I asked them to move my dressing room . A room became available that ' s exactly 63 steps closer to my car ! You save miles every week . I ' m also closer to the elevator . So_much time is usurped by learning lines , every minute counts. &quot; On a less mundane level , both feel that they bring more depth to their roles now . &quot; We are 10 years richer_in our lives , &quot; Geary says . &quot; The trust factor we had , the ability to listen to each other with our hearts , minds and imaginations has always been there . But now , Genie is a formidable young_woman who really knows her craft and business . It ' s a joy working with her. &quot; Francis , now a real-life wife ( to Jonathan Frakes of the syndicated &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation &quot; ) , welcomes the chance to break Laura out of her ingenue status , particularly in_playing a mother . And , she says , the chemistry between the two , which had been so unmistakable the first time around , is still strong . &quot; The pleasant surprise for me is that when I look_into Tony ' s eyes , he ' s still 100 % present , sharing everything that ' s going_on , &quot; she says . &quot; Acting with him is like a beautiful dance. &quot; Geary also had a revelation . &quot; It was a surprise to me how much energy this takes , &quot; he says . &quot; Bill was low maintenance . But Luke burns at a higher flame . I ' d forgotten how much he loves life . I ' m 10 years older -- he almost burned me out then ! Being a little more mature now , shall we say , I do have a better sense of pacing . But I fall_asleep easily at night. &quot; Presumably , the ABC brass are resting easily as well : The day that Luke and Laura aired for the first time , the ratings shot_up almost 24 % from the previous week ' s 6.1 / 22 share , to an 8.0 / 27 share . The show , which had been finishing third or fourth of 10 soaps , came_in second that week with a 6.6 / 23 share , and has often finished second since then . The actors are pleased , of course , but say their focus remains on their work rather than Nielsen ratings . They are also gratified that fan reaction has been positive but not -- unlike 10 years ago -- overwhelmingly frenzied . &quot; I think it ' s doing a slow build , &quot; Francis says . &quot; Tony and I were talking_about that . We said , ' What are we ? ' It ' s almost as if the characters are mythological to modern-day folks . It feels only warm_to me this time , though . Last time I was too young , and not ready. &quot; Adds Geary , who makes a cameo appearance as Luke with Francis ' Laura on Tuesday night ' s episode of ABC ' s &quot; Roseanne &quot; : &quot; Luke and Laura have a life force of_their_own . They ' ve lived_in the audience ' s hearts ( for the past decade ) , without our even wearing the clothes . So it ' s sort of like picking_up where we left off. &quot; &quot; General Hospital &quot; airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on ABC . &quot; Roseanne &quot; airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on ABC .</TEXT>
