   <HEADLINE> TIME TO LAY_DOWN THE TRADE WEAPON ; CHINA : FLEXIBILITY IS NOT A WEAKNESS IN OUR NATIONAL_LEADERS . PRESIDENT CLINTON MADE THE RIGHT DECISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many of us shared President Clinton ' s dilemma regarding trade with and human_rights in the People ' s Republic_of_China ; he was in a no-win position . His campaign promises were in direct conflict with a responsible reaction to important strategic factors . In my opinion , he made a correct and courageous choice to continue China ' s most-favored-nation status . I first visited China as a young sub-marine officer , operating with Allied ships along the coast in the springtime of 1949 , during the last few months that forces of Chiang Kai-shek controlled the major seaports . From the deck of our ship moored in the harbors of Shanghai and Tsingtao ( now Qingdao ) , we could see the campfires of Mao Zedong ' s forces in the_hills . I developed a lifetime interest in China . As President , I inherited a dormant and timid U.S. policy based on the Shanghai communique of 1972 that acknowledged there was only one China but , because of the influence of Republican conservatives and the Taiwan lobby , failed to say which one . I initiated secret talks designed to normalize relations with China , which culminated in the announcement of mutual diplomatic recognition , effective on the first day of 1979 . With China ' s tremendous influence in Asia and its immeasurable potential as a trade partner , I saw this decision as beneficial to our country and its policies . Since leaving_office , I have visited various parts of China , including Tibet , and have observed the remarkable opening of the society as far as free_enterprise is concerned , with increased freedom for people to move from one place to another and to make economic decisions . I have had numerous discussions , mostly fruitless , with Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders about extending similar political rights . Their response has been that they also honor human_rights , but with emphasis on the rights of every citizen to a home , employment , health_care and an education . China ' s leaders are not yet willing to accept the risks of political destabilization that became evident to them at the &quot; democracy wall , &quot; where activists posted criticisms of the government , and at Tian An Men Square with the massive student demonstrations . The government ' s excessively harsh reaction was a tragic mistake that brought_on continuing confrontation with the United States . It is not inconsistent with my role as a human-rights advocate to believe that political freedoms will be encouraged best in China by maintaining harmonious relations between our countries . Perhaps contrary to the expectations of Chinese leaders , economic freedoms will lead inexorably to other personal liberties . There is no doubt that our President and Congress made the best effort possible to encourage human-rights progress in China through the threat of withholding favored trading status and other economic punishments . Since the United States seemed absolutely alone among nations in this threat , sustaining our position was becoming patently counterproductive . Furthermore , the public excoriation of China ' s leaders made_it almost impossible for them to modify their policies . The Chinese are especially sensitive to the appearance of yielding to criticisms or threats from foreigners and despise intrusion in what they consider to be internal matters . When I was President , many foreign leaders reacted defensively when I criticized human-rights abuses of their citizens . But I insisted that their professed commitment to the United Nations charter , the Universal Declaration of Human_Rights and other agreements provided legitimacy to the discussion of these issues . We Americans have not abandoned our determination to support human_rights in China , including the protection of Tibetan customs and culture . As a private citizen , I have made efforts to consummate commitments made in 1978 by Chairman Deng Xiaoping to approve direct talks between Beijing leaders and the Dalai Lama , with the proviso that the independence of Tibet would not be_on the agenda . So far , Tibetan and Chinese leaders have not accepted this proposal , but we must continue pursuing this and other human-rights goals . Perhaps now , even more_than 15 years ago , China ' s cooperation with us is crucial in addressing such strategic challenges as domestic conflicts in Cambodia and Burma and the impending development of a nuclear arsenal in North_Korea . Those who criticize President Clinton for modifying his position should remember that the ability to be flexible in dealing with changing circumstances and to abandon unworkable policies is not a weakness but an attribute of strong leadership .</TEXT>
