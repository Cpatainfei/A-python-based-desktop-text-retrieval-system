   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIAN KILLS ISRAELI , WOUNDS 4 ; TRAVEL CURBED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Palestinian extremist , armed with a submachine_gun , fired on Israeli civilians and soldiers in a drive-by attack in the Israeli port city of Ashdod on Thursday , killing one person and wounding four . The incident occurred even as the armed wing of a Palestinian fundamentalist group announced a campaign of terror , which it said would turn Israel and the occupied territories into a war zone in the next seven days . The warning from the extremist group Hamas was contained in leaflets distributed in the territories . They said there would be four more attacks , including a rocket barrage , on Israeli targets in continuing retaliation for the Feb . 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque . Later Thursday , another radical Islamic fundamentalist group took responsibility for the drive-by_shooting , the second deadly Palestinian attack on Israeli civilians in two days . Islamic Jihad , which occasionally coordinates attacks with Hamas , said one of its members -- a Palestinian refugee from Gaza who was shot and killed by two Israeli bystanders during the Ashdod attack -- had acted in retaliation for the Hebron massacre . The escalating violence came as Israel observed a morning moment of silence and reflection for its annual commemoration of the Holocaust . In other developments Thursday : * Within hours of the drive-by_shooting , police issued a blanket order barring all Palestinians from traveling into Israel from the occupied territories , canceling thousands of special permits issued to Palestinian laborers in the weeks since the territories were sealed after the Hebron massacre . The new &quot; comprehensive closure &quot; took_effect at 5 p.m. Thursday , and a police spokesman said it will continue &quot; until further notice. &quot; * Israeli families in the northern town of Afula angrily and tearfully buried teen-age girls , teachers and a bus_driver who were among the eight killed and more_than 45 wounded when a Hamas suicide-bomber blew_up an Israeli passenger bus Wednesday -- an attack that Hamas said Thursday was just the opening salvo in a strategy to turn Israel ' s Independence_Day next Thursday &quot; into hell. &quot; The Palestine Liberation Organization officially expressed regret and sent condolences to families of the victims of the Afula bus bombing . The PLO statement was criticized by some as insufficient . * Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s government resisted angry calls from the Israeli opposition to halt talks with the PLO on Palestinian autonomy . * The government , citing security concerns , canceled a Palestinian conference at a Jerusalem hotel at which the Rev . Jesse Jackson was to speak . Security and Mourning As family and friends in Afula left flowers at a charred bus stand Thursday and mourned with anger at funerals throughout the sleepy blue-collar town , some residents echoed Israel ' s political opposition in sharply criticizing the government . One Afula resident , who identified herself as Ricki Sabag , told Israel Army Radio : &quot; Rabin is a partner to this murder . . . . In my opinion , he must go_home and free the post for people stronger than he. &quot; At one point , Micha Goldman , Rabin ' s deputy education minister who represented the government at the Afula funerals , was cursed and attacked by several mourners . He was removed for his own safety after Goldman declared : &quot; The government of Israel will not allow murderers -- the murderers of Israel , the murderers of peace -- any rest ! We will pursue them ceaselessly. &quot; The tone was markedly different , though equally pain-filled , among friends and family at the funeral of Ishai Gedassi . He is the 31-year-old father of five who was gunned_down Thursday morning while hitchhiking in Ashdod . As they laid the former soldier to rest at his kibbutz , Gedassi ' s friend Shlomo Anexter described him as &quot; a central figure &quot; in the struggle for peace . &quot; He wanted peace . He was willing to do a lot for it , &quot; Anexter said . &quot; I think that this was a little too_much , though. &quot; But Israel ' s top military_leaders said there is little or nothing that can be done to stop terrorist killings . Gen . Ehud Barak , Israel ' s chief_of_staff and its most senior military commander , said Wednesday ' s suicide bombing and Thursday ' s drive-by killing are terrorist acts impossible to avert . He explained that the blanket security order he issued for the territories Thursday was a further attempt to defend against Hamas ' vow of similar attacks to come . But Palestinian leaders and Israeli human_rights groups denounced as &quot; unjust &quot; the comprehensive closure order , which a spokesman for Israeli authorities in the West_Bank said canceled nearly 20 # 000 special travel permits . Only about 1 # 000 permits allowing passage &quot; for humanitarian reasons &quot; -- for individuals such_as doctors , ambulance drivers and patients in need of special medical_care -- will be exempted , said a spokesman for the Civil Administration , Israel ' s military authority in the West_Bank . &quot; We think that the closure is an act of collective punishment -- it ' s not justified , &quot; declared B ' tselem , the Israeli human_rights group , adding that the security order has deprived tens of thousands of impoverished Palestinians of their only source of income in Israel . Israel and the PLO As an official PLO announcement from Tunis , Tunisia , expressed regret for the continuing Palestinian violence against Israelis , Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin scheduled an emergency meeting of his Cabinet ' s security committee today . Rabin also met for several hours with the Israeli delegation , which is in the final stages of negotiating an agreement with the PLO for Palestinian autonomy and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho . Rabin ' s government continued to resist mounting efforts by Israel ' s right-wing opposition and one of_his_own Cabinet members for an immediate suspension of the talks with the PLO . &quot; The government is responsible_for the deterioration in the personal security of the citizens of Israel and for its unprecedented low point since the establishment of the state , &quot; declared Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of the opposition Likud Party . Rafael Eitan , who heads the opposition Tsomet Party , observed : &quot; The government is paralyzed . It is the obligation of the government to immediately suspend the talks with the terrorists. &quot; But several key government officials indicated that the Israeli delegation still plans to return to bargaining with the PLO at a scheduled session Sunday in Cairo . Only through a final agreement and concrete changes in the territories , they said , can the government neutralize the threat from armed extremists who are trying to destroy the peace process . Expressing &quot; sorrow &quot; over Arafat ' s initial silence amid the carnage , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , a chief architect of the peace process , said after an emergency meeting of the ruling Labor_Party , &quot; We have to be clear : Just as we will not hesitate to employ every method against terrorism , we will not stop for a minute the negotiations for an agreement on Gaza and Jericho. &quot; Despite the government ' s commitment to the peace process , there was almost universal Israeli condemnation of Arafat ' s failure to condemn or even comment publicly on the continuing slaughter of Israelis by Hamas -- a rival Palestinian faction that opposes Arafat ' s Fatah faction and his peace efforts with Israel .</TEXT>
