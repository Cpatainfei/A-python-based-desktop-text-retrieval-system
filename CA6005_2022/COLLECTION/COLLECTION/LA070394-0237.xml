   <HEADLINE> MOVEMENT TO RECLAIM LOST LAND REFUSES TO DIE ; SOUTH_AMERICA : THE ASSASSINATION OF THREE INDIAN LEADERS IN COLOMBIA FAILS TO DETER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FROM TRYING TO RETAKE RESERVATIONS FROM SETTLERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The three Indians -- friends who grew_up on the same reservation and ascended to top national posts -- were barreling down a gravel road when they drove straight into an ambush . A fusillade of bullets erupted out of the night on March 26 , riddling the Indians ' red pickup with some 60 holes . The three men -- leaders of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia and a tribal_chief who also served as alternate senator -- didn ' t have a chance . Their driver died alongside them . Settlers are suspected in the bloodiest attack on Indian leaders in modern Colombian history . It came as militants of the Zenu tribe are retaking their reservation from settlers and are feuding with the mayor over hundreds of thousands of dollars . The fight of the Zenu is the struggle of tribes across the continent to regain lost land . In Venezuela , the Yucpa tribe went_on an arson spree and blocked highways this year to press for the return of land in the foothills of the Sierra de Perija Mountains . In Brazil , the Macuxi tribe has been clashing with encroaching non-Indians in the Amazon rain_forest -- a Wild_West atmosphere of raids on Indian villages by rifle-toting ranchers and counterattacks by Indians on horseback . The Zenu ' s fight goes_back to Spanish colonial times when the tribe was granted a 205 # 000-acre reservation called San Andres de Sotavento , also the name of the area ' s main town . The Indians lost their rolling hills and plains over the centuries to whites who simply ignored reservation boundaries and settled there , and to businessmen who loaned the Indians money for seeds and tools and then took the land when crops failed and the Indians couldn ' t repay the loans . Among the newer non-Indian settlers are drug_traffickers who have invested their earnings in cattle_ranches . As a ceiling fan stirs the air in his sweltering , cramped office in San Andres de Sotavento ' s &quot; Indigenous House , &quot; acting Zenu Chief Jose Carmona -- replacing Chief Hector Malo who died in the ambush -- and fellow tribal leaders declare they won ' t be cowed . Their decision to continue retaking reservation land and confronting the mayor puts them on a collision course with the settlers , including the traffickers who have no compunction about gunning_down anyone who stands_in their way . &quot; We are not afraid , &quot; said Jose Lucas , whose brother Luis was one of the slain leaders . &quot; As warriors , we must keep going forward. &quot; Parked in the courtyard below Carmona ' s second-floor office is graphic evidence of the ambush : the charred , bullet-riddled pickup in which the four Indians died . The killers burned the pickup , the only vehicle the government had given the reservation . With no money to carry_out their programs , the Indian leadership can ' t even afford to fix the Indigenous House ' s backed-up , reeking toilets . A few blocks away is the settlers ' center of power : the office of Mayor Juan Bautista . Indian leaders say they suspect Bautista was behind the ambush because he has refused to release $ 700 # 000 the government allocated for the reservation , and because Chief Malo received a death threat two days before the ambush as he met with his subchiefs to plan how to get the money . Bautista , sitting behind a desk in his air-conditioned office and with gold chains adorning his neck and wrist , denied responsibility . &quot; I had nothing to do with it , &quot; he said . &quot; My conscience is clear. &quot; Outside , young toughs with pistols in their waistbands stood_guard . Colombian mayors , often targeted by anti-government rebels , commonly use bodyguards . Until this year , Bautista decided how federal funds earmarked for the reservation should be spent . Now , reservations are in_charge of such funds , though they still must be channeled through local mayors ' offices . Bautista said he has not handed_over the money because the Indians haven ' t submitted the proper paperwork . A senior government official in Bogota said it was unlikely Bautista was behind the ambush because &quot; he ' s not stupid ; it would have been much too obvious. &quot; Settlers who elected Bautista and who created paramilitary groups -- initially to fight leftist guerrillas but which are now being used against Indians -- probably ordered the massacre , the official said . &quot; They thought they could kill the Indian movement by assassinating the leaders , &quot; said the official , interviewed on condition of anonymity . &quot; On the contrary , the Indians are becoming even more determined. &quot; In the 1970s , the Zenu began recovering reservation land lost over the centuries by simply moving_in . They build huts on the land , forcing a confrontation with settlers and triggering the intervention of the Agrarian Reform Institute , which buys the land and gives it to the Indians for communal use as recovered reservation . Zenu leaders complain they must create a climate of crisis before the institute steps_in . Although Indians have a constitutional right to their reservations , government officials say the state can ' t simply expel ranchers whose families have worked the property for generations and -- considering the many claims by tribes across the country -- can ' t afford to buy all_the land . &quot; There ' s just not enough money in the budget , &quot; said Jorge Lopez , the vice minister of government . About 39 # 000 acres -- one-fifth of the reservation -- has been recovered with the strategy , in which the Indians risk being shot , beaten or jailed . Alberto Santos , wearing only sandals and ragged pants secured by string , is the Zenus ' symbolic presence on a disputed ranch called San Francisco . Living with his wife and eight children in a shelter of thatched_palm fronds supported by wood beams , Santos grows crops on San Francisco with other Indian families . Two years ago , security_forces burned the Indians ' huts on San Francisco , destroyed their crops and threw nine Indian men , including Santos , into jail . The Indians say they have no choice but to persist . &quot; Hunger makes us brave , &quot; said Rafael Noriega , a Zenu subchief . &quot; Landowners pay us 1 # 500 pesos ( about $ 2 ) per day to work their fields . If a man has children , how can he feed them ? &quot; We must have our own land. &quot;</TEXT>
