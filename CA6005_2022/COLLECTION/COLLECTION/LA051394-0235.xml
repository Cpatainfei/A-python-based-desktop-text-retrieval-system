   <HEADLINE> FENCES BEING BUILT AT THREE CUP SITES ; SOCCER : RFK , COTTON BOWL AND STANFORD GOING AGAINST ORGANIZING COMMITTEE ' S WISHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concerns about security problems during the World Cup have prompted three venues to defy the wishes of the World Cup Organizing Committee and soccer ' s international governing body and erect fencing between stadium seating_areas and the playing fields . In a conference_call Thursday , World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg again emphasized that chain-link fences to keep fans off the playing fields would not be necessary during the World Cup_finals , which begin June 17 . In fact , he said , fences ringing a field could lead to injuries from fans being crushed against them . Nevertheless , local police at three of the nine World Cup venues have overruled Rothenberg and FIFA , soccer ' s international authority , and have begun installing fences at RFK Stadium in Washington , the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto . Because of crowd-control problems in Europe and elsewhere , fences commonly have been used in soccer to keep fans from rushing the field . But the recent trend has been to remove the fences . Tragedies such_as the Heysel Stadium disaster in Brussels in 1985 drew attention to the potential for danger . In that game , 38 fans suffocated or were crushed to death when a fence separating rival fan groups collapsed . FIFA has taken a strong stand against fences . Joseph Blatter , the general secretary of FIFA , has said , &quot; Animals in a zoo belong behind fences , not people. &quot; This World Cup offers a unique logistics problem : Seating areas in American stadiums tend to be closer to the playing_fields , thus not allowing a buffer zone between fans and players . In addition , soccer fields are longer and wider than football_fields . In many of the stadiums that will be used in this year ' s tournament , the playing area extends_to the edge of the stands . World Cup officials had considered fencing or plexiglass barriers but rejected that idea . In some venues , such_as the Rose Bowl , the same effect will be achieved by cutting_back seats , mainly for sight-line considerations . At the Rose Bowl , the first 10 rows of seats in the end zones and the first six on the sidelines will not be sold . Those seats will be draped with tarps . &quot; We think that the correct plan is to remove fences , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; Our concern in the United States is not people rushing the playing_field to do harm to the players or officials . Our concern is an exuberant fan rushing down to celebrate . Our concern is that in the mad rush to get_down there , people will get crushed against a fence. &quot; * In other World Cup news , the World Cup Organizing Committee has agreed on a policy regarding the sale of alcohol during games . The issue had come_to_the_fore when Rothenberg sent a letter last month to the mayors of the nine venue cities , asking_for alcohol bans on game days . During the 1990 World Cup in Italy , some cities instituted alcohol bans on game days to prevent security problems caused by drunken fans . The guidelines , which were completed Monday but have yet to be announced , recognize that the final_decisions regarding alcohol sales can be made only by stadium management and local authorities . The World Cup guidelines : -- A two-beer maximum per person . -- Serving sizes of no larger than 12 ounces . -- No sales by vendors in the seating_areas . -- No alcohol sales sooner than 90 minutes before game time . -- No alcohol sales after halftime . -- Suspension of sales when it is determined that fans are drinking excessively or the mood of the crowd is becoming dangerous . David Simmons , World Cup venue executive_director at the Rose Bowl , said he submitted the proposal to the city of Pasadena on Thursday and had not received a response . &quot; The city has the right to control alcohol , &quot; he said . &quot; Early indications are that they will say no and not allow us to sell alcohol in the licensed premises. &quot;</TEXT>
