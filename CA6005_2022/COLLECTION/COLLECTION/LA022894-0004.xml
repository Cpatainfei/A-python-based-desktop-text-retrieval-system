   <TEXT> If the attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan shows anything , it is that athletes who compete with a win-at-all-costs attitude may be skating on thin ice . While enjoying the wintry grandeur of the Olympic games and pondering the questions around Tonya Harding ' s participation , we can observe National Sportsmanship Day on Tuesday by helping student athletes keep competition in perspective . Is winning everything ? Does sportsmanship matter ? Should athletes be role_models ? Is &quot; sports ethics &quot; a contradiction ? Is an athlete ' s or coach ' s behavior necessarily &quot; right &quot; even though they do not violate rules ? Since 1991 , more_than 6 # 000 schools nationwide , elementary to university , have benefited from addressing these questions . According to Olympians Florence Griffith Joyner ( running ) and Tom McMillen ( basketball ) , co-chairs of President Clinton ' s Council on Physical_Fitness and Sports , &quot; Sports should teach us honesty , integrity and humility , as well as develop a sense of fair play and excellence. &quot; Excellence . The ancient_Greeks used a very similar word , arete , to describe the original Olympic athletes . Arete not only meant excellence in skill but excellence in character . &quot; Sportsmanship &quot; is the modern term we use to describe playing fairly , respecting the opponent , being considerate in victory and defeat . Sportsmanship should be cultivated in young people if they are to keep athletic competition in perspective . &quot; Playing fairly &quot; and &quot; being a good winner / loser &quot; are worthwhile ideals because they show us where numbers on scoreboards end and where life-enriching qualities of character begin . With these themes in mind , here are a_few things we can do to promote the ideals of National Sportsmanship Day : * Suggest to school and community sports leaders that a general code_of_conduct be developed to guide fans , student athletes and coaches at sporting events . The code should be visible : Consider printing it on game programs and gym posters or around playing fields . * School administrators , teachers and community athletics organizers can remind student athletes , parents and fans through mottoes , meetings , posters and other means that winning is not everything and that losing does not make one &quot; a loser. &quot; Publicly praise teams that demonstrate sportsmanship in defeat . * Encourage student athletes to be the same on or off the field . This doesn ' t mean they can ' t play to win , but it does mean they can ' t let their competitive spirit get_the_best of them . * Parents and teachers should encourage athletes to ask , &quot; Is this action right or wrong ? &quot; just as much as they ask , &quot; Is this action against the rules ? &quot; Tonya Harding did not break a law by failing to report the attack on Nancy Kerrigan , but she still did not do the &quot; right &quot; thing -- contacting police immediately . * If your school has a skillful coach with integrity and ethical character , give him or her your support no matter the team ' s win / loss record . When it comes_to the educational development of student athletes , winning percentages mean as little as the paper on which they are recorded . * Develop year-round programs to help students prepare_for the ethically confusing world of today ' s sports . One example is the Student Athletes Future Empowerment ( SAFE ) program at First A.M.E. Church in L.A. SAFE conducts &quot; preventive maintenance &quot; seminars to help athletes prepare_for the often unsportsmanlike business of college recruiting . We must teach students that they are all role_models . Just because they may never become famous athletes does not mean their words , actions and values do not influence others . The question is never , &quot; Should I be a role_model ? &quot; but is always , &quot; What kind of role_model should I be ? &quot;</TEXT>
