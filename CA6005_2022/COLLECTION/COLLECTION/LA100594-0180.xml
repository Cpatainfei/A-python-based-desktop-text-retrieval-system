   <HEADLINE> DRUG CARTEL LINK IN KILLING OF PRI LEADER IN MEXICO DESCRIBED AS WEAK BY SOURCE ; LATIN_AMERICA : OFFICIAL THINKS SOME IN RULING PARTY MAY BE PUSHING IDEA SO THAT SLAYING WON ' T APPEAR TO BE POLITICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Links between the notorious Gulf drug cartel and Mexico ' s second major political assassination in six months may be far more tenuous than some reports have suggested , a source close to the investigation said Tuesday . The investigation thus far &quot; has not tied the Gulf cartel or any other cartel &quot; to the murder of Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the No . 2 official in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , said the knowledgeable official . The Gulf cartel certainly has contacts at all levels of the Mexican government , the source said , but narcotics ties to last week ' s murder are weak . However , Assistant Atty . Gen . Mario Ruiz Massieu , who is the slain man ' s brother , told reporters late Tuesday that , &quot; We are working basically on three hypotheses and one has to do with political motives , the other with the possible participation with drug_traffickers and the third is a combination. &quot; Leaks from the investigation and official communiques have both emphasized that the attorney_general ' s office is pursuing leads related to narcotics . PRI leaders have dismissed suggestions of divisions within the party between reformers and the old_guard , usually referred to as &quot; dinosaurs. &quot; &quot; They don ' t want it to look_like a political murder , &quot; the source said . &quot; So far , all_of the people involved are in the PRI . They want to take the heat away from them and put it on the drug_traffickers . Nobody likes drug traffickers. &quot; He made the comments shortly before the attorney_general ' s office announced that another suspected conspirator , arrested Tuesday , said the trail to the mastermind of the assassination reaches higher than Congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha , already implicated in the plot . The suspect , Jose Martin Ramirez Arauz , said that people above Munoz Rocha ordered the slaying , according to the attorney_general ' s statement . The statement did not give any names . Ramirez Arauz , who said he is a congressional employee , and another suspect arrested Tuesday are both relatives of Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez , an aide to Munoz Rocha . Rodriguez Gonalez ' s brother , Jorge , said Fernando planned the slaying at the behest of his boss , according to previous statements from police . Both men arrested Tuesday said they were aware of the plot , according to the announcement . The only motive Ramirez Arauz mentioned for the murder was that Munoz Rocha said the changes that Ruiz Massieu was making and planned to continue making in the PRI &quot; got_in his way , &quot; according to the statement . That coincides with a previous statement from Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez , who police say told them that Munoz Rocha was opposed to Ruiz Massieu ' s reformist views and did not want him to become Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies , as planned . The ties to drug dealers rest_on three weak links , according to the source : * The minor drug record of a south Texas man who once owned the murder weapon . * A drug investigation file that names Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez , the suspect who , according to police , told them he bought the murder weapon and recruited the triggerman for the assassination . * The relationship by marriage of suspected plotter Abraham Rubio Canales and alleged drug dealer Raul Valladares . Even that relationship has been exaggerated , the source said . Police believe that Rubio Canales ' nephew is married to Valladares ' stepdaughter , he said . Other sources had said their children were married . Further , while Valladares is believed to be a major drug dealer , he has not been a member of the Gulf cartel for at least two years and was never particularly close to its suspected leader , the source said . But the source said that police were questioning Rubio Canales on Tuesday . A former official in the Guerrero state_government when Ruiz Massieu was governor , Rubio Canales is serving a 14-year sentence for land fraud . Police said Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez told them that Rubio Canales conspired to murder Ruiz Massieu . A statement from the Chamber of Deputies said that a caller claiming to be Munoz Rocha also blamed Rubio Canales . The caller , according to the statement , said he had proof that Rubio Canales had masterminded the killing and that the caller feared for his safety . Colleagues who knew Rubio Canales early in his career remember him as a well-trained and responsible public official . They said they were shocked at his conviction on land fraud charges , not to mention suggestions that he might be involved in a killing . Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez , according to police , told them that Rubio Canales was bent_on revenge , blaming Ruiz Massieu for his imprisonment . But PRI officials have played_down allegations that the assassination was the result of splits within the party .</TEXT>
