   <HEADLINE> STATE REPORT OPTIMISTIC ON ELECTRIC_CARS ; POLLUTION : DETROIT HAS ASKED THAT 1998 INTRODUCTION BE DELAYED . BUT AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS SAY TECHNOLOGY IS NEARLY READY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Disputing the auto industry ' s claims that electric_cars remain too impractical and expensive to mass-produce , the state Air Resources Board on Wednesday released an analysis portraying the technology as nearly ready for widespread consumer use . The agency ' s review concludes that batteries available for electric_cars already meet the needs of most commuters , and that operation and maintenance of the cars is comparable in cost to that of gasoline-powered vehicles . The rosy outlook for exhaust-free automobiles lays the groundwork for a highly anticipated decision by the air board this spring . In May , the ARB must review whether the technology has advanced enough to meet a state mandate requiring the auto industry to begin selling large_numbers of the cars in less than four years . If the regulation goes_into effect , car_makers that fail to meet the mandates would lose their certification to sell vehicles in California . Under the standard , 2 % of vehicles sold each year in California by major manufacturers -- an estimated 20 # 000 to 25 # 000 cars -- must be emission-free beginning in 1998 . The volume increases to 5 % in 2001 and 10 % in 2003 . The zero-emission mandate , set by the ARB in 1990 , has come under_fire from Detroit ' s Big Three auto_companies , which are pressuring the Wilson Administration for a delay of two years or more , depending_on their success in perfecting high-energy batteries . Although the auto_manufacturers are striving to develop electric_car prototypes for California -- including General Motors ' Impact and Ford ' s Ecostar -- they say the battery technology lags too far behind to guarantee consumers cost-efficient and practical cars by 1998 . The ARB ' s draft report gives the auto industry little technical ground for delaying the standard . The companies , however , still dispute the findings as overly optimistic , given the high costs and complexities of beginning production of large_numbers of cars entirely new from the tires up . &quot; I have a lot of high hopes too . But it ' s a difference between saying something is ready and saying it is just a goal , &quot; said John Wallace , director of Ford ' s electric vehicle development program , who also represents a consortium of the Big Three manufacturers and the U.S. Energy_Department working to produce advanced batteries . &quot; The projections you are seeing in this report are absolutely consistent with our goals , too , &quot; he said . &quot; But I have literally scores of engineers involved . . . and all_the data piled_up doesn ' t lead me to believe that these projections and goals are in any way achieved . A lot of work needs to be done. &quot; According to the ARB ' s report , four currently available battery technologies generate enough power to run a car for 80 to 100 miles between recharges , which would accommodate the commutes of nearly 85 % of Californians . By 1998 , a_battery with twice that range is likely and it will have a lifetime of five to eight years , the report says . The review also concluded that operating and maintaining an electric_car eventually could be cheaper than using a traditional car , even when the cost of replacing the expensive , 1 # 000-pound battery pack is included . &quot; The total operating_cost of an electric vehicle can be less than the total operating_cost of a conventional Ford Escort , &quot; the report concludes . The cost of the electricity will be &quot; a little over a penny a mile , &quot; compared fuel costs of 4 1 / 2 cents per mile for a traditional car , the report says . According to the report , the biggest drawback is that the purchase_price of electric_cars initially will be higher than that of gasoline-powered vehicles . One consultants group estimates the sticker price at $ 21 # 000 . The air agency ' s report , however , portrays that as a temporary start-up problem . &quot; This principle holds true for the introduction of any new technology that is initially produced in small volumes . . . . Over the long-term , however , electric vehicles are expected to cost about the same as conventional vehicles , &quot; it says . Working together , Detroit ' s Big Three and battery manufacturers recently have created several advanced , high-energy battery packs that seem promising , including sodium-nickel-chloride batteries and improved versions of conventional lead-acid ones . But the industry stressed that these are handmade prototypes that cost around $ 100 # 000 to build , and that manufacturers are far from being able to mass-produce them at a reasonable cost . The ARB report acknowledges that today ' s costs are high , but says some pilot production plants are already in the works that will make the new technologies commercially available at a much lower cost . &quot; that ' s easy for them to say , but as the engineer responsible_for making the cost go_down , there are a lot of things we have to do , &quot; Wallace said . &quot; With almost all these technologies we have active programs , and they are intended to help solve these problems . . . . But they are taking the goals of these technologies and assuming they are a done deal. &quot; Auto industry officials said they plan to present new data to the ARB disputing many of the findings , especially concerning the cost and durability of the batteries . A workshop is scheduled for March 25 in El Monte . &quot; There ' s bound to be differences_of_opinion , but this is the staff ' s view after compiling a vast amount of information from different sources , not just from Detroit , but from Japan and Europe and private entrepreneurs , &quot; said ARB spokesman Bill Sessa . The air board must again review the zero-emission mandates in 1996 , but this year ' s decision is expected to be the crucial turning point for the auto industry . Under the state standards , GM , Ford , Chrysler , Honda , Nissan , Mazda and Toyota will be forced to market electric_cars first . Most of the European and small Japanese manufacturers have until 2003 . California ' s unique requirement for emission-free cars is the hallmark of the state ' s program to clean its air , which is the nation ' s worst . Motor_vehicles are responsible_for at least half -- and perhaps 75 % -- of the gases that form the Los Angeles Basin ' s notorious smog . At this point , the ARB staff has made no recommendations as_to whether its electric_car deadlines should remain intact since they must first analyze comments received over the next two months . However , ARB Chairwoman Jacqueline Schafer , appointed to the board by Gov . Pete Wilson in November , repeatedly has said the Administration supports the clean-car rules . &quot; California is_on the right course toward achieving its air quality goal , &quot; she said , &quot; and the way we have been able to make progress has been through an aggressive program of clean cars and clean fuels. &quot; * RELATED STORY : D2</TEXT>
