   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; PUTTING A PRICE ON VIOLENCE ; THE GUNFIRE LASTED ONLY SECONDS , BUT FOR TAXPAYERS THE COST SPIRALS ENDLESSLY . HERE ' S A LOOK_AT THE TOLL FROM ONE SHOOTING IN WHICH A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS LEFT PARALYZED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is another sad tale from an often cruel city where , according to FBI statistics , residents are about twice as likely as the national average to become victims of violent crime . This time , though , let ' s not look_at the cost of the ongoing mayhem in terms of human suffering , but rather in dollars . This time , pull_out your calculator and pity the taxpayers -- many of whom , because they live_in areas less touched by it , still seem to figure that street violence is someone else ' s problem . This is the story of one case , documented from court records and with interviews and reports from various agencies . It began April 29 , 1991 , exactly one year before the city exploded into riot . Cindy Rodriguez , then 12 , had stayed home that day to interpret for her Spanish-speaking mother , who was taking one of Cindy ' s eight siblings to the dentist . About 3:30 p.m. , Cindy and her sister , Nancy , heard the mail_carrier arrive in the parking_lot of their building on Imperial Avenue in South-Central Los Angeles . Cindy expected a letter from a friend , so she and Nancy , then 15 , ran_out of their small apartment and watched as the carrier stuffed mail into the cluster of aluminum boxes . At that moment , kitty-corner from the building , a tricked-out red Nissan Pathfinder entered the parking_lot of Church ' s Fried Chicken . As with most such events , accounts of what happened next depend_on who is telling the story , and from what perspective . Roscoe Frederick , a crack dealer and alleged associate of a Blood gang set , says he and a friend pulled_up to the drive-through window . Frederick says he was waiting for his fries with his window down , bumping &quot; Nobody Beat the Biz &quot; by rapper Biz Markie , when he noticed a guy by the restaurant door who seemed to be admiring his Pathfinder . Frederick says he was just about to ask , &quot; You like this ? &quot; when the restaurant door swung open and &quot; a dude came_out of the chicken place and fired three shots at me , boom-boom-boom . &quot; A teen-ager who was standing outside the restaurant -- we will call him Jim Smith -- had a different perspective . He says Frederick pulled into the lot , shouted an insult at someone near the restaurant and started shooting . Either way , one bullet lodged_in Smith ' s shoulder and another tore through the hip of the 15-year-old beside him , dropping him to the cement . Nancy and Cindy had already heard enough gunfire in their lives to guess the caliber of the shots that snapped and popped across the street . Nancy saw smoke rising from the gun of a youth she knew as &quot; Little Man , &quot; a member of a local Crip gang set . She would later say she saw him dart into the street and run toward her . Cindy had seen gang skirmishes before . &quot; I ' m going_home , &quot; she said , as the Pathfinder pulled from the lot and stopped in the middle of Imperial . &quot; Let ' s run_for it , Nancy ! &quot; Cindy shouted . Instead , Cindy crumpled . &quot; Get_up ! &quot; Nancy ordered . &quot; Nancy , I can ' t get up. &quot; &quot; Stop goofing off , get_up , &quot; Nancy replied , leaning down , frightened . &quot; It felt_like my body was burning , &quot; Cindy says now . A . 38-caliber , hollow-point bullet had entered her left side , near the stomach , sliced_through her spinal_cord at the third lumbar_vertebra , and fragmented . The largest piece lodged_in her clothing . &quot; It felt_like there was a water hose in me with all_the blood coming_out , &quot; she recalls . * Public coffers began hemorrhaging money as well , as the people connected by those bullets were caught in the numbingly complex tangle of lifelines and restraints thrown_out by already overburdened institutions . There is no official tracking of the total volume of dollars it costs society after such an event . Many agencies involved are_on duty anyway , so to calculate such spending is , in a sense , academic , and some of the figures that follow are speculative . But imagine just this once that each time a dollar was paid , a societal overseer punched a button on a giant cash_register , sounding a loud ca-ching . Within minutes of the shootout , the city ' s emergency response system went_to work . Two Los Angeles Police_Department patrol units arrived_at 3:55 p.m. and four officers began preliminary crime scene investigation No . DR 91-1813758 . A &quot; Lifeforce &quot; engine from city Fire_Station 64 and rescue ambulances from Stations 33 and 65 pulled into the intersection , followed by a battalion chief and paramedics supervisor -- 11 fire personnel . At 4 p.m. , an LAPD sergeant arrived , followed by three officers who began holding_back the crowd . Even as the intersection swarmed with police , members of a third gang arrived to check_out the action . When they spotted two young_men from yet another gang set there gawking , they attacked with fists and tire_irons . &quot; They ' re coming_into our territory . That don ' t go ! &quot; one gangbanger shouted to a TV news crew . Amid the chaos , an LAPD patrol unit took Smith to the hospital , while ambulances hauled_off Cindy and the 15-year-old . The ambulances prorate their charges at about $ 6.85 a minute , which , including the run to Martin_Luther_King / Drew Medical_Center , totaled $ 911 . The fire personnel ' s hours came_to about $ 4 # 324 , according to department records . Meanwhile , Detective Raymond Monroy and his partner , Michael Calhoun , joined 17 officers now on the scene ( six others had arrived , assisted briefly , and left ) . Monroy took_charge of the investigation , interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence . An LAPD photographer took pictures . Exclusive of Monroy and Calhoun ' s time , the expense to taxpayers for the police response , based on conservative estimates of per hour salaries cross-referenced with the crime scene log , comes_to about $ 635 . A forensic specialist cost another $ 42 . LAPD dispatched a helicopter to try to spot the fleeing Pathfinder . Its two hours of use , including wages for the pilot and observer , cost $ 405 . Back on the ground , inside a web of yellow crime-scene tape , Monroy and Calhoun worked 24 hours straight on the investigation . According to figures supplied by public information Officer Arthur Holmes , the detectives ' cost , exclusive of overtime , was about $ 1 # 307 . The total cost of that initial response ? $ 7 # 624 . Cindy had lost a lot of blood and slipped into shock as she was wheeled into the trauma center . A doctor removed her left kidney and parts of the hollow-point bullet . But fragments remained lodged in her spine . The next day , Cindy awoke with tubes running_down her mouth and nose and poking from her chest , and a colostomy bag at her side . She had no idea where she was . A doctor entered the room trailing medical_students . &quot; She ' s a paraplegic , &quot; he announced . &quot; She got shot . She ' s never going_to walk again. &quot; Those remarks , Cindy recalls , were her first indication of what had happened . &quot; I got shot ? &quot; she cried . &quot; You didn ' t know ? &quot; the doctor asked . Cindy spent six days in the intensive care unit , for which King billed the state_Department of Health Services ' Medi-Cal $ 2 # 632 a day . ( The hospital ' s Medi-Cal contract allows_for only a $ 920-a-day reimbursement , but the full costs are ultimately absorbed by the county facility and society. ) From ICU , Cindy was wheeled into the pediatric unit , where she spent nine days at a per diem charge of $ 1 # 234 . The two other victims also underwent surgery at King . Smith was discharged the next day ; the other youth May 1 . If both lacked private insurance , the minimum estimated cost to taxpayers in Medi-Cal funds for them was $ 7 # 896 . The total for this first stage of the victims ' hospital treatment : $ 34 # 794 . Soon after the shooting , a &quot; citizen informant &quot; called LAPD ' s South Bureau CRASH unit saying that the shooter was a hustler named &quot; Roscoe. &quot; A detective checked his files and found Roscoe Frederick . Monroy went_to King with a &quot; six pack &quot; photo lineup . Smith ' s arms were incapacitated , but he indicated that the driver -- the shooter , he said -- was the man in picture No . 5 , Roscoe Frederick . Hours before that interview , just shortly after the shooting , an employee of a Gardena body shop had watched Frederick wheel his Pathfinder into the garage . According to the man ' s later testimony , Frederick asked him to patch bullet_holes in the door and side , fix a shattered rear_window , and paint the red vehicle blue . A few minutes after Frederick ' s arrival , the employee said , Brian Keith Cage , Frederick ' s stepbrother , arrived to give him a ride . The man said he watched Cage open the truck ' s door , pick_up a handgun and slip it into his waistband . That night , the employee saw a TV report about the shooting . His conscience and his good_sense began a heated debate , he later told prosecutors . When he had cooperated with police after another incident , the man said , gang members had kidnaped his brother . But the thought of a 12-year-old lying_in a hospital got the better of him . He called Gardena police and told them about the bullet-riddled Pathfinder . Tuesday , April 30 , was Frederick ' s 20th birthday . At 3 p.m. , an LAPD stake-out team -- seven officers and a lieutenant , Monroy recalls -- set_up inside the body shop and across the street . They left that evening when the shop closed , and returned the next morning . Finally , on May 2 , Frederick arrived_at 5 p.m. But the shop employees didn ' t recognize him , and he eluded the stakeout . At 7:30 , two patrol officers spotted Cage and arrested him . On May 7 , on his attorney ' s advice , Frederick surrendered to Monroy . With another warrant , police impounded and searched his Pathfinder . A police chemist , according to reports , found a bloodstain , a bullet , a casing and fingerprints . By now , the shooting ' s costs had spread like fragments of the hollow-tip bullet through the organizations and enterprises that have blossomed as a result of Southern California ' s relentless bloodshed . The chemist ' s time cost about $ 42 . Towing the truck cost $ 68 . The officers ' and lieutenant ' s time for the stakeout -- conservatively assuming that each was at the lowest pay scale -- came_to about $ 4 # 771 . Monroy continued working the case , and estimates his and Calhoun ' s additional investigation costs at $ 1 # 118 through early May . Cost of the additional investigation and arrests : $ 5 # 999 . On May 13 , Cindy was transferred to Rancho Los Amigos Medical_Center in Downey . The spinal injury had left her paralyzed , although she has some feeling in one leg . For 3 1 / 2 months , the Rancho staff worked_on Cindy ' s rehabilitation , providing physical_therapy , counseling and instruction , while continuing her junior_high_school education . At a flat daily rate of $ 1 # 193 , Rancho billed Medi-Cal $ 120 # 494 for Cindy ' s stay . At the end of July , 1991 , Cindy returned home . By October , she had incurred another $ 4 # 209 in pharmaceutical expenses -- ranging from stomahesive paste to catheters and colostomy bags -- which Medi-Cal paid . Between her release and the end of September , Rancho billed an additional $ 725 for physical and vocational therapy and $ 1 # 175 in other medical services , according to a computer-generated bill . Total cost of her additional treatment to this point : $ 126 # 603 . In early May , 1991 , detectives Monroy and Calhoun went_to the seventh-floor offices of the district_attorney ' s hard-core gang unit at the Compton courthouse . Linda Bushling , one of 12 attorneys there , added the case to the 16 or so murders and attempted murders she already juggled , and filed charges against Frederick : three counts of premeditated attempted murder . County probation_officers investigated Frederick and wrote a report , at the standard cost of $ 420 . Frederick was arraigned on May 13 , and -- over Bushling ' s objections -- bail was set at $ 250 # 000 . He remained in custody until family and friends raised the bond . The case , meanwhile , began to move through the criminal justice system , racking_up expenses to taxpayers virtually every day . Monroy , for example , estimates that he put_in 30 to 50 hours keeping tabs on witnesses and tracking_down details . Figuring the time at 40 hours , that ' s $ 1 # 118 . ( Taxpayers were spared one expense : Both Frederick and Cage hired private attorneys. ) On June 24 , 1991 , Case No . TA012928 arrived for preliminary hearing before Judge Steven Suzukawa , in Division VI of Los Angeles County Municipal Court . Four witnesses -- Nancy , Smith , Monroy and the body-shop employee -- were called . Prosecutor Bushling presented five exhibits , including photos of the Pathfinder and diagrams of the shooting scene . Testimony lasted one day and generated a 147-page transcript . According to an estimate by a budget analyst with the State Judicial Council , a day of court time in a felony preliminary hearing , including the judge ' s salary , ancillary personnel and paperwork , costs taxpayers $ 3 # 950 . Monroy ' s time came_to another $ 223 . The case file moved to Superior_Court and began racking_up notations that reflect its glacial progress : On July 8 , 1991 , the defendants pleaded not_guilty . On Aug . 5 , the case was continued . On Sept . 12 , the court denied a motion to dismiss brought by the defense . On Sept . 23 , Oct . 18 , Oct . 29 , Nov . 19 , Nov . 26 and Dec . 3 , the court granted defense motions to continue the case . And on Dec . 12 , the court transferred the proceedings to Judge Thomas R . Simpson . Throughout the first_half of 1992 , the case continued to dribble along on a string of continuances , as transcripts were prepared and the prosecutor or defense_attorney reported scheduling conflicts . Bushling appeared in court on Jan . 9 , 14 , 15 , Feb . 3 , 14 , 27 , 28 , March 6 , April 8 , May 11 , June 11 , 17 , and July 1 , 21 and 23 . Conservatively figuring that each motion took 30 minutes of court time , that adds_up to a prorated cost to the court of $ 5 # 916 . Total cost of the legal preliminaries : $ 11 # 627 . As the case progressed , local gang members , including friends of &quot; Little Man , &quot; were not bashful about expressing their feelings to Cindy and her family , she says . Sometimes they would walk by and laugh_at her as she sat in front of the family apartment in her wheelchair . They called the house and harassed her and Nancy . During those months , body-shop workers also received threats from gang members , says Bushling : &quot; They were terrified. &quot; ( In an unrelated incident some months after the shooting , Monroy says , a rival drug dealer shot and killed &quot; Little Man &quot; -- who was not charged in Cindy ' s shooting. ) Like so many people in high-crime areas , the Rodriguezes found the violence hurting them in other , unexpected ways . When Cindy lay_in the hospital , her mother , Maria , a seamstress at the time , took_off work for two weeks to be near her . Her sisters missed school . Her father , Jose , had recently lost his job as a silk-screen printer , and he took the shooting hard , staying by Cindy ' s bedside the whole time she was in ICU . But he left the family soon after , Cindy says , her eyes tearing_up . Two weeks after Cindy was shot , a brother-in-law was killed in a gang-related incident , bringing more grief to her overwhelmed family . Families often disintegrate after violence , as the enormous emotional and economic stresses collide , says Paul Juarez , a researcher at King and past chairman of the Violence Prevention Coalition of Los Angeles . Caring_for an injured child pushes already difficult circumstances to the breaking point , he says . And when a poor family loses its grip on financial security , society ' s costs can surge . In this case , no one in the Rodriguez family took_advantage of financial assistance offered by the district_attorney ' s victim assistance program , so the sole costs to taxpayers , prorated by the time worker Mary Sutton put_in on the case , would be about $ 1 # 200 . On Aug . 10 , 1992 , Frederick ' s case went_to trial . Simpson seated 12 jurors and two alternates . A sheriff ' s deputy , deputy clerk and court reporter were present . Even the circle of people drawn_together to contend with the shooting were not immune to the larger epidemic it reflected . On the second day of the trial , the judge excused a juror whose brother had just been shot and killed . Bushling ' s first witnesses were Nancy and Cindy . She also called Detective Calhoun . Using material prepared by the district_attorney ' s staff , she documented the state ' s case with 22 exhibits , including aerial photographs and an illustration of a bullet prepared by a forensic specialist . The estimated cost , excluding materials , was $ 213 . The trial lasted five days . Smith , who had been shot in the shoulder , abruptly lost all memory of events , testifying to virtually every question : &quot; I don ' t know. &quot; But Bushling , who had seen plenty of witnesses &quot; go sideways , &quot; educated the jury on the realities of gang intimidation and impeached Smith with his own testimony from the preliminary hearing . At 2:01 p.m. on Aug . 18 , the jury announced it had reached a verdict . They found Frederick guilty of premeditated attempted murder on a &quot; John_Doe , &quot; guilty on two counts of assault with a firearm on Cindy , and guilty on one count of assault with a firearm on Nancy . He was also found to have used a firearm , which added a mandatory four years to his term . Forget about calculating the amount_of_money the jurors ' employers paid to subsidize the time they were impaneled . Bushling estimates that she spent 87 hours preparing the case -- not counting time she worked_at home -- for a total expense of $ 5 # 428 . The detectives ' time_off the streets for the trial prorates to an estimated $ 2 # 178 . The judge ' s salary and other court expenses total $ 19 # 750 . The cost of the trial to taxpayers : $ 27 # 889 . On Sept . 14 , Judge Simpson sentenced Frederick to life in prison with possibility of parole , tacking_on four more years . He was moved to the state_prison at Corcoran . Frederick had already spent 56 days in county jail -- at a daily rate to taxpayers of $ 44.35 -- for a total of about $ 2 # 483 . Experts predict that unless his conviction is overturned or shortened on appeal , he will not receive a parole hearing for 15 years . The state_Department of Corrections estimates the annual cost to taxpayers of incarcerating an inmate , exclusive of prison building costs , at $ 20 # 751 a year . If Frederick is released after 15 years , his incarceration will have cost about $ 311 # 265 , which doesn ' t take_into_account inflation or costs of his eventual parole . &quot; All I did was go get some chicken , then all this jumped up , &quot; Frederick said from prison . &quot; When they took me to court , for my trial , my wife was six months pregnant . ( Since then ) she had my little daughter . . . . If I have to do all this time , she ' ll be out of high_school by the time I come home. &quot; Prosecutor Bushling had decided soon after Cage ' s arrest that it would cost taxpayers less to put him away for a probation violation from a cocaine-related conviction than to prosecute him as an accessory_after_the_fact to the shooting . A judge complied with that request , and he was sent to Wasco State_Prison for a three-year sentence . Cage says he served 18 months , which translates to a cost to taxpayers of $ 31 # 126 . Frederick appealed his conviction ; on Sept . 25 , 1992 , that process began . A state_attorney general ' s spokeswoman said that figuring the costs of the appeals process is &quot; just about impossible. &quot; But estimates are possible . The 2nd District Court of Appeal oversaw 2 # 552 cases for fiscal_year 1991-92 . Support staff puts_in an average of 22 hours per case ( at about $ 90 an hour ) to keep the complex filing process moving , according to an appeals court budget analyst . Average_cost per case : $ 1 # 980 . The cost per case for the judge ' s time averages about $ 1 # 120 . To file the &quot; respondent ' s brief &quot; on this particular appeal , Deputy Atty . Gen . Arthur H . Auerbach says that he put_in 55 hours , at $ 85 an hour , for another $ 4 # 675 . In December , 1993 , the court upheld Frederick ' s conviction and sentence , and the state Supreme Court denied his attorney ' s petition to hear the case . Not factoring_in the costs of inflation or pushing the appeal_to the federal level , the taxpayer cost for incarceration and appeals is $ 352 # 649 . Cindy , meanwhile , moved with her family to a house a_few miles from the shooting site . As documented by a 45-page Medi-Cal computer printout , her incidental medical costs , administered at Rancho , King , County-USC Medical_Center and other facilities over the last three years have come_in fits and starts . The institutions billed Medi-Cal $ 8 # 916 for additional medical_care and therapy . On top of that , Medi-Cal paid_for $ 5 # 530 in medical equipment . Jeff Cressy , community liaison for Rancho ' s spinal_cord injury project , cites estimates that someone with Cindy ' s level of injury spends an average of $ 1 # 596 annually on equipment and maintenance alone , in 1988 dollars -- money that Medi-Cal will likely provide . Actuarial tables show that a person with her injuries has an expected life span of 71 years , says Monroe Berkowitz , a Rutgers professor and author of the book &quot; Economic Consequences of Traumatic Spinal Injury. &quot; So Cindy ' s additional lifetime equipment-related bills will probably hit $ 90 # 972 . A partially paralyzed person pays , on average , $ 138 more per year in prescription_drugs , for another lifetime total of $ 7 # 728 , paid by Medi-Cal . Cindy now participates in an anti-gang volunteer project with Los Angeles Teens on Target , a group coordinated by Dr. Luis Montes , one of her doctors at Rancho . Another community organization flew her to Washington , D.C. , last year , where she attended President Clinton ' s inauguration as one of the hundreds of young &quot; faces of hope. &quot; Cindy returned , however , to a future considerably different than the one she envisioned as a bright-eyed 12-year-old with fashion_model dreams . Now 15 , Cindy attends Locke High_School . The Los Angeles Unified School District provides the bubbly adolescent with special_education classes and counseling at an estimated added expense of $ 5 # 800 a year . If she graduates , as she plans to do , the additional cost to taxpayers for her education will come_to $ 29 # 000 . Cindy still hopes to work as a model . But , on the advice of counselors , she is also making backup plans . Her confident demeanor suggests that she will accomplish whatever she puts her mind to . But the fact is , someone with a disability such_as hers has a harder_time doing everything from getting dressed in the morning to feeding herself at night . If she does_work , actuarial_tables show that a partially paralyzed woman will lose an average of $ 6 # 570 in wages a year in her lifetime . The Social_Security_Administration contributes $ 446 a month in Supplemental Security Income with an additional state benefit of $ 63.40. This payment is subject_to potential reductions based on earned income and will vanish if she becomes able to walk . If not , taxpayers will be tapped for at least $ 348 # 156 . Assuming neither a worst- nor best-case scenario , the total for such lifetime costs will likely come_to about $ 490 # 302 . Six weeks ago , Cindy re-entered Rancho so surgeons could correct a spinal problem and , as she says , &quot; mess with my kidney. &quot; An infection developed and she remained hospitalized for 28 days . The bill came_to $ 33 # 404 . In 1991 , the year Cindy was shot , 677 children or teen-agers were wounded or killed in 583 separate drive-by_shootings in the city , according to a USC study . And the LAPD reported 43 # 783 aggravated assaults . Most injuries were less serious than Cindy ' s . Some were more so : 953 Angelenos were murdered , 771 of them in gang-related crimes . One shooting shattered Cindy Rodriquez ' s life . It will cost taxpayers about $ 1 # 091 , 768 .</TEXT>
