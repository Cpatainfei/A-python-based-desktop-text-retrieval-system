   <HEADLINE> TALKS UNDER WAY FOR U.S. TOUR BY MICHAEL JACKSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Jackson , whose recent headline-making has been largely limited to the allegations of child molestation and his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley , appears ready to launch a campaign to refocus attention on his music . Discussions are underway for Jackson to begin his first North_American concert tour since 1989 -- possibly as soon as February , sources close to the singer confirmed Tuesday . No dates have been booked , but word is circulating among concert promoters around the country that the trek would probably concentrate_on 15 # 000- to 20 # 000-seat arenas rather than stadiums . Dates reportedly are also being explored for European shows as soon as November . Jackson is completing work_on five new songs that will be included in &quot; History : His Story , &quot; a greatest-hits album that is scheduled to be released by Epic Records in November . Jackson ' s representatives would not confirm the tour plans , but concert industry experts say that the timing would make_sense . Jackson , 36 , had just started a world tour in Asia in the summer of 1993 when allegations were made that he had sexually molested a teen-age boy . Numerous shows were subsequently either postponed or canceled before the tour was ultimately scrapped in November when the singer said he needed treatment for an addiction to a painkiller . At the time , there was much public speculation about whether the allegations would permanently damage Jackson ' s image as an entertainer . But with a settlement in that case and his recent marriage , there ' s a perception that the time is ripe for Jackson to try to reclaim his self-proclaimed status as the &quot; King of Pop. &quot; &quot; Michael needs to reconnect with his audience , &quot; says Gary Bongiovanni , editor of the concert industry trade magazine Pollstar . &quot; And he really needs to do_it in North America. &quot; But Bongiovanni and others in the concert industry warned that Jackson should not assume that his drawing power is unlimited . &quot; He should certainly not play stadiums , &quot; says Bongiovanni , referring to the strategy of the 1984 stadium tour that he did with his brothers . &quot; that ' s too risky. &quot; The consensus also is that Jackson should not be tempted by the high prices -- $ 100 and more -- commanded this year by such acts_as Barbra Streisand and the Eagles . &quot; This is not a new basis for ticket prices , &quot; says Denver-based concert promoter Barry Fey . &quot; Even Michael Jackson will not be viewed the same as Streisand , Pink Floyd or the Eagles . But Michael has never been inclined to charge an outrageous ticket price. &quot; Jackson made his first public U.S. appearance since the surprise May wedding when he and his wife opened Thursday ' s MTV Video Music Awards in New York with a kiss . Though the couple was warmly applauded , industry observers say the real test of the last year ' s impact on Jackson ' s popularity won ' t be known until the album goes_on sale . Other observers feel the tour will be an even bigger measure of Jackson ' s fan support . One reason for going_on the road in February , Bongiovanni said , is that the market won ' t be as competitive as it is normally in the summer . Jackson ' s first public performance since last year could come_on Oct . 8 for an Elvis Presley tribute concert in Memphis . He and Presley-Jackson are rumored to be part of the performing lineup for the show , which also will be televised as a pay-per-view special .</TEXT>
