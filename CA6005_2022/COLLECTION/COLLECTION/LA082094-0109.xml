   <HEADLINE> ARIZONA GOVERNOR APPROVES FAMALARO EXTRADITION ; JUSTICE : PAINTER ACCUSED OF MURDERING DENISE HUBER MUST FACE A COURT HEARING AS EARLY AS MONDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Arizona ' s governor signed extradition documents Friday that could force house_painter John J . Famalaro to return to Orange County to face charges he murdered a young Newport Beach woman and kept her nude , handcuffed corpse in a freezer for nearly three years . Gov . Fife Symington signed the extradition papers after they were forwarded to him by California Gov . Pete Wilson as part of a lengthy process to move a criminal defendant over state_lines , said Douglas Cole , Symington ' s spokesman . An extradition hearing for Famalaro is scheduled for Aug . 29 , but Yavapai County Counsel Thomas Lindberg said Friday the governor ' s signature means the hearing could be held as soon as Monday . Famalaro is accused of murdering 23-year-old Denise Huber , who vanished after her car broke_down on the Corona del Mar ( 73 ) Freeway in June , 1991 . Arizona authorities discovered Huber ' s body last month in a running freezer in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . Investigators now suspect she was killed in a Laguna Hills storage bin and are planning to move the case to Orange County for trial . On Friday , Lindberg filed a legal motion to dismiss a single felony theft charge remaining against Famalaro in Arizona to help smooth extradition . The charge stems from the stolen rental truck . Lindberg said that he expected Yavapai County Superior_Court Judge Raymond W . Weaver to schedule an extradition hearing Monday or Tuesday to determine whether Famalaro wants to continue fighting extradition . &quot; From there , it ' s just a matter for Orange County or Costa Mesa police to arrange to pick him up , &quot; Lindberg said . Famalaro , who has pleaded not_guilty , could face the death_penalty if convicted . A search of Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home turned_up 3-year-old Orange County newspapers that carried stories about Huber ' s disappearance and her parents ' futile attempts to find her . Huber ' s clothing and purse were found in Famalaro ' s garage in a box marked &quot; Christmas. &quot; Orange County Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia could not be reached to comment about extradition late Friday . But he said this week that a therapist has begun visiting Famalaro in the Yavapai County Jail . Gumlia said a team of psychologists and psychiatrists is lined_up to examine Famalaro when he arrives in Orange County . Gumlia said the move does not indicate he plans an insanity defense . The attorney said he routinely requires psychiatric examinations at the outset of serious cases . This week , Ventura County authorities said they no longer suspect Famalaro in the abduction and death of Nancy Huter of Thousand Oaks , who disappeared March 3 , 1992 . Famalaro was considered a suspect because the circumstances were similar to the Huber case . As in the Huber case , authorities found Hurer ' s abandoned car after her disappearance and officers found no sign of a struggle near her vehicle . Huter ' s body was found near Malibu more_than a year after she vanished . &quot; I think we have been fairly able to establish that he was not connected to this case , &quot; Ventura County Sheriff ' s Lt . Craig Husband said .</TEXT>
