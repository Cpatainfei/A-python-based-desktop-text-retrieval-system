   <HEADLINE> MEZZALUNA : GO FOR THE SCHMOOZE , STAY FOR THE FOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s Sunday evening at Mezzaluna , and the regulars have already assembled around the restaurant ' s L-shaped bar . A confident , attractively dressed Corona del Mar crowd sips moscato and grappa while nibbling on some of Orange County ' s most authentic Italian cooking and , more to_the_point , getting grandly schmoozed up in lilting Florentine-accented English by Romano Molfetta , arguably Orange County ' s most charming restaurateur . There ' s no missing Molfetta ; he ' s the rakishly handsome man behind the bar wearing a designer sweater , professorish spectacles and a tennis_player ' s tan . Once upon a time he was an Alfa Romeo executive , but somehow he got_into the food business along with friend and colleague Aldo Bozzi of the original Mezzaluna in New York City . ( Neither of his Mezzalunas is related to the restaurants of the same name in Aspen and Beverly Hills. ) Even though this Mezzaluna is open from late morning to the wee hours , I ' ve never been here when Molfetta wasn ' t behind the bar . His wife , Pamela , is also a fixture , and together the two give this place a real neighborhood air , the sort that a good trattoria needs for survival in Italy . It ' s this fact , and not the chichi design or the delicious food , that explains Mezzaluna ' s lasting appeal . The air of familiarity makes Mezzaluna the most Italian of Orange County restaurants -- a ristorante integrale , integrated into the local scene , if you will . It hasn ' t been easy , though . For its first few years the restaurant was struggling , in part perhaps because it is so resolutely Italian . Corona del Mar diners weren ' t taken with the restaurant ' s cracker-crust pizzas , chewy pastas or delicately flavored appetizers in the early days , nor were they totally comfortable eating fancy Italian dishes in what is really a fancied-up cafe . But gradually , Molfetta ' s dogged charm , combined with Piedmontese chef Ugo Allesina ' s rustic cooking , won a steady following , and today the restaurant appears to be over the hump . There is likely to be a good crowd whenever you dine there now , and the air is often thick_with conversation in Italian . The word mezzaluna , it should be mentioned , has two Italian translations : the crescent moon and a crescent-shaped kitchen chopper with two wooden handles . As a result of that double sense , the restaurant ' s walls are plastered with colorful interpretations of the waxing ( or waning , if you are of the half-empty-cup school ) moon done_by various artists . The plates , the menu and other paraphernalia are decorated with a logo of the traditional chopper done_in blue and yellow . Open the black plastic menu cover ( red if you come for lunch ) and the first thing you see is a list of specials printed on bright red paper . This is where chef Allesina gets creative , even a touch outrageous . At the very top of the page is his tropical salad of shrimp , avocado , papaya and other ingredients -- something you ' d expect to be served at a Mexican resort . When slightly ripe chunks of avocado meet slightly unripe chunks of papaya , the result is surprisingly pleasurable . You ' ll find wonderful trattoria dishes like eggplant ravioli in a sauce of basil , tomato and goat_cheese and orecchiette ( ear-shaped noodles ) with spicy sausage , rapini and tomato_sauce . Allesina prepares a light , distinctly Japanese tuna carpaccio with watercress ( de_rigueur in Corona del Mar , though scandalous to a red-blooded Italian ) , a crisp , nearly greaseless veal Milanese and a hearty , if pedestrian , chicken Parmigiana . Neapolitan-style pizzas , cooked downstairs in a wood-burning oven , are listed on the menu ' s back page . I can ' t even think_of coming here without ordering at least one pizza scamorza e radicchio , with smoked mozzarella , little pieces of broken radicchio and chunks of fresh tomato . The delicate smoke-flavored cheese plays off this crust like music , with the other components adding little grace_notes of flavor . Pizza ai funghi ( with mushrooms ) is one you find all_over Italy , the intense mushroom flavors somehow magnified by the oven ' s wood embers . There ' s even a traditional pizza Napoletana -- anchovy , capers , oregano -- even though Naples is a long , long way from Molfetta ' s home town of Florence . The chef ' s lasagna verde alla Bolognese is rich and creamy , the bechamel sauce giving the green lasagna with meat sauce an effect as much French as Italian . Pappardelle ai funghi porcini -- wide , flat noodles with earthy porcini mushrooms -- have the richness of Allesina ' s own home region of Piedmont . Paglia e fieno ( literally &quot; straw and hay &quot; ) is so named because it is composed of a mix of green and golden fettuccine , one made with spinach , the other with egg . Allesina serves them in a light tomato_sauce with chicken , peas and broccoli . I ' ve also had a tasty version of capellini d ' angelo here . The angel-hair pasta is served in a simple basil and garlic tomato_sauce . It ' s big with the regulars at the bar . You can have piatti secondi such_as seafood mixed grill or a sliced grilled steak similar to a Florentine beefsteak here , but main_course dishes seem beside the point_after the pizzas and pastas . The restaurant ' s light , ethereal desserts , though , make perfect sense . Take the coffee zabaglione . Zabaglione is essentially egg_yolk and sugar whipped into a froth , and why more restaurants don ' t have the inspired idea to add a bit of coffee is beyond me . For chocolate-lovers there ' s torta al cioccolato , sort of a bittersweet Italian fudge pie . Bavarese , otherwise known as Bavarian cream , is a molded dessert ( here in the shape of a heart ) fashioned out of gelatin , cream and fruit . Mezzaluna ' s is flavored with mango , served with a three-fruit coulis . The heart shape is no coincidence , I ' m guessing . This is one restaurant with a lot of heart , and if you don ' t believe me , belly up_to the bar and see for yourself . Molfetta makes people feel_like regulars in no time . Mezzaluna is high-end moderate . Antipasti are $ 3 to $ 12 . Pizzas are $ 9 and $ 9.50. Pastas are $ 9.50 to $ 11 . Main_courses are $ 14 to $ 20 . * MEZZALUNA * 2441 E .
