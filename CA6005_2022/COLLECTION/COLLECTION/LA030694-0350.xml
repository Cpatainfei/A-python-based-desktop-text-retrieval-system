   <TEXT> When President Clinton declared last month that America ' s $ 59.3-billion trade_deficit with Japan was &quot; unsustainable , &quot; it was not the first time the Japanese had heard such a warning . In 1973 , for example , then-President Richard M . Nixon warned that &quot; our economic disputes could tear the fabric of our alliance. &quot; The year before , the deficit had reached $ 4.1 billion . Threats by the Clinton_Administration to retaliate with sanctions carry an aura of deja_vu here , too . In the first Japan-must-open-its-markets speech , then-Commerce Secretary John T . Connor complained in 1966 of Japan ' s virtual ban on foreign investment . &quot; We are determined to uphold the principles of equity and reciprocity -- positively or negatively -- whichever is called_for , &quot; he declared . Connor spoke six months after the United States suffered its first trade_deficit with Japan : $ 359 million in 1965 . Twenty-eight more annual deficits , countless rounds of trade negotiations and American cries of &quot; Wolf ! &quot; -- made at ever higher levels of red ink -- have followed . President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did slap 100 % tariffs on $ 300-million worth of Japanese imports as a penalty for a single alleged Japanese violation of a bilateral agreement on semiconductors . Clinton , by contrast , is now pondering a totally new path in U.S.-Japan economic relations -- one that would impose sanctions to punish the entire Japanese market , which he insists is closed . On Thursday , he revived the harsh &quot; Super 301 &quot; trade provision , which lets the President apply punitive tariffs against the goods of unfair trading partners . Twenty-eight years of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations show that if Clinton does not act , the credibility of American threats will vanish . If he does act , the penalties will have to produce billions , not millions , of dollars worth of damage to reduce the &quot; unsustainable &quot; trade_deficit to a &quot; sustainable &quot; level -- and that could precipitate a trade war . Foremost among the lessons of those negotiations is : Expect no voluntary Japanese concessions , and none at all that will cause pain and injury to Japanese industry . When Prime_Minister Kakuei Tanaka finally ended the government ban on 100 % foreign ownership of companies in Japan in 1973 , private industry already had set_up its own wall against foreign takeovers by establishing an intricate system of cross-holding stocks . The system , which continues today , ensures that no more_than about 30 % of any company ' s stock is ever traded publicly . Another lesson of U.S.-Japanese economic relations is : Ignore Japan ' s competitive strength at your peril . Despite predictions in the 1960s that Japan was destined to become an economic superpower , Americans mostly ignored Japan ' s growing strength . Nixon was the first president to devote major attention to Japan . At a time when high tariffs , non-tariff barriers , import quotas , and obstacles to foreign investment handcuffed American businessmen here , Nixon spent two years and five months bludgeoning Japan into implementing restraints on 18 categories of textiles . Although some Japanese textile items had gained as much as a 50 % share of the American market , at the time Japan accounted_for only 3 % of total textile sales in the United States . The lack of American attention also has allowed problems to grow to_the_point where solutions became virtually impossible . Japan ' s share of the U.S. market for television_sets , for example , tripled to reach 30 % during a 1974-76 period in U.S.-Japan economic relations that American officials described as &quot; trouble-free. &quot; Only in 1977 did Japan implement a program to restrain exports of television_sets . And it was not until Japanese cars seized nearly 20 % of the American market in 1981 that Washington forced Japan to implement &quot; voluntary &quot; restraints on those exports . Today , the only firms that manufacture TV_sets in the United States are foreign-owned -- mostly Japanese . And cars built by Japanese-owned firms last year held a 29 % share of the U.S. passenger_car market , an increase of about 10 % since the export restraints went_into effect . ( Japanese auto_makers ' investments in plants in the United States provided the growth. ) By contrast , the Big Three hold a 0.29 % share of the car market in Japan . Not until the Reagan_Administration did the United States begin to focus_on non-tariff barriers and the workings of the Japanese economy . Despite claims by Clinton_Administration officials that &quot; nothing works &quot; to drive down Japanese surpluses , history shows that a booming Japanese economy does pull_in imports and cut red ink . Three times since 1966 , the U.S. deficit with Japan has fallen . Most recently , from 1988 through 1990 , red ink plummeted by 31 % as American exports to Japan leaped by $ 20 billion . But when Japan ' s economy fell_into sluggishness in 1991 , American export growth halted . Conversely , appreciation in the value of the yen initially drives_up the U.S. deficit . But if the pattern of the past repeats itself , the 20 % appreciation of the yen since the beginning of 1993 will drive down Japan ' s surpluses later this year or next year . Ironically , Japan ' s economic friction with the United States has precipitated proposals for fundamental change that , if implemented , might indeed reduce Japan ' s surpluses permanently . Various Japanese leaders have essentially echoed American assertions that Japan needs to change its culture to be more receptive to imports . Prime_ministers back to Tanaka ( 1972-74 ) have talked_about reversing Japan ' s priorities from &quot; production first &quot; to &quot; living standards first &quot; to promote domestic-led growth and pull_in imports . &quot; The only way we can solve ( the problem of land prices ) is to start building skyscrapers , &quot; Tanaka said shortly before he took_over as prime_minister . &quot; Yet today the average height of a building in Tokyo is only 1.7 stories . We should start restricting not the height of buildings but rather the lowness of them . ( For ) so many of our problems , what we must do is totally reverse our present policies and laws. &quot; A report drawn_up under Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1986 , known as the Maekawa report , proposed no less than a restructuring of the entire economy so that the country would rely wholly on domestic demand for growth . Such changes were taken_up under the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative under President George_Bush , with some success . Japan agreed to increase its public works spending for 10 years . Large retail_stores , which tend to handle imports , have found it far easier to establish new outlets since then . And Japan ' s Fair Trade Commission at least has started acting against collusive practices that help keep foreigners out of the market . Yet , the average height of buildings in Tokyo is still 1.7 stories . Calls_for overall government deregulation , most recently taken_up by Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , have not produced any action . And not one major Japanese automaker has reduced its reliance on exports below 37 % of its total production . Back in the 1960s , Americans were battling Japanese government quotas on imports of even such items as chewing gum and ketchup , not to mention computers . Even non-quota items required import licenses , copies of which were sent to responsible government bureaucrats , who could exert pressures on potential buyers . In 1972 , Japan had the world ' s second-highest tariffs -- an average of 11 % -- on manufactured goods , after Britain . Now , it maintains the lowest average -- 1.9 % -- of any advanced nation . And import quotas on beef and citrus_fruit have been removed . A &quot; nightmare &quot; that William E . Brock said he suffered as Reagan ' s trade representative in the early 1980s -- that &quot; Japan does everything we ask it to do , and we wind_up with no change in our trade_deficit &quot; -- has in_effect come true , at least in part . Now that many , if not all , government obstacles have been removed , the business practices and mind-sets of Japanese corporations and consumers shape_up as the biggest headache . Japan ' s markets have nonetheless opened_up far more_than Americans are willing to recognize . Just four days before Clinton and Hosokawa fell_out at their Washington summit Feb . 11 , Clinton ' s own economic advisers issued a report -- one the President ignored -- suggesting that removal of all Japanese barriers would shave the $ 60-billion U.S. trade_deficit by only $ 9 billion to $ 18 billion . In addition , much of the American trade_deficit with Japan has been created by Americans . &quot; Of some $ 60 billion of Japanese exports to the United States , about one-third -- more_than $ 19 billion -- are parts which American companies import from Japan . . . . Japan is being used to help make American products , &quot; Nakasone said in 1985 . In autos -- which alone account_for more_than 60 % of the American deficit -- there is no question that American manufacturers were kept_out of the market here during the days of boom growth . In the 1960s , Japan forbade foreign investment in its auto industry , imposed tariffs of up_to 40 % on imported cars , and limited the number of foreign car salesrooms to 10 per company . Today , American auto_makers hold minority shares_in Japanese auto firms , are free to build factories of_their_own , and face no tariffs on either cars or auto parts . Nor do limits on establishing showrooms exist any longer . Now the main obstacle is persuading established dealers in Japan to handle American cars . The only remaining government barrier -- Japanese safety standards that force American auto_makers to remodel the cars they ship here -- could be eliminated by building the cars to meet the standards in the first place , as the Japanese do with cars they ship to the United States . Signs of change have emerged only recently . Chrysler ' s new Neon and General Motors ' Saturn models are considered potential winners here -- although they are not yet on sale . And all_of the Big Three have finally declared they will install right-hand drive_in the cars they ship to Japan , where cars run_on the left side of the road . But between the 19 # 000 cars that the Big Three sold in Japan last year and the 2 # 482 , 345 that the Japanese sold in the United States lies a long , long road . US-JAPAN TRADE TENSIONS : VOICES THROUGH THE YEARS Maurice H . Stans , Commerce_secretary , May , 1969 : &quot; It is no accident that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty commits our two nations to seek to eliminate conflicts in their international economic_policies . Without conscious effort of political will , our economic disputes could tear the fabric of our alliance. &quot; President Richard Nixon , in a foreign_policy report , May , 1973 : &quot; No nation can expect to enjoy for long the fruits of a one-way policy. &quot; Sen . Lloyd Bentsen , May , 1980 : &quot; If it is impossible or impractical for the Japanese to buy more from us , then we must be prepared to purchase less from them . I can see no good reason for the United States to commit economic hara-kiri on the altar of a bogus free-trade relationship. &quot; Malcolm Baldrige , Commerce_secretary , October , 1981 : ' In the past , it ' s been mostly the Congress which has been worried about this ( U.S. imbalance in trade with Japan ) . Now it ' s the Congress and the Administration . . . . The trade imbalance cannot keep growing like this , even between friends. &quot; Akio Morita , Sony chairman , March , 1982 : &quot; Americans are trying to impose their own laws and their own ways_of_life on the rest of the world . . . . Things appear to have gotten as bad as they were_on the eve of World_War II. &quot; Robert A . Mosbacher , Commerce_secretary , March , 1990 : &quot; No system can long function in a state of permanent disequilibrium . There will be corrections. &quot;</TEXT>
