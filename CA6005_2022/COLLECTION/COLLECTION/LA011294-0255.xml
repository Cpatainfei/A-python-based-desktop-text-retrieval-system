   <HEADLINE> CHAMPIONSHIP ADDS SPICE TO PINCIROLI ' S U.S. EXPERIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Enrolling at El Toro High began as a language thing for Brazilian Bill Pinciroli . It later turned_out to be a water_polo thing . Water_polo is as traditional as empanadas in the Pinciroli family . His father played_on two Olympic teams and his older sister is playing professionally in Italy . But Pinciroli ' s first objective in coming_to the United States two years ago was to learn English , then to play water_polo . &quot; I wanted to do both , but I would have come anyway , &quot; Pinciroli said . Because of Southern Section residency rules , Pinciroli , who is from Sao Paulo , Brazil ' s capital , was forced to sit_out the 1992 varsity season , playing_on the Chargers ' practice team his junior year . The layoff wasn ' t disruptive . Pinciroli helped lead El Toro to a come-from-behind victory in the Division I Southern Section championship game , and was named the division ' s player of the year . He had a team-high 89 goals , an impressive 61.4 % shooting percentage and contributed 52 assists and 58 steals . But Pinciroli isn ' t the only talented Brazilian water_polo player at El Toro . According to Charger Coach Don Stoll , had senior Marco Avanzi been eligible -- he practiced with El Toro and was one of the team ' s most ardent supporters -- he would have threatened his fellow countryman ' s chances for player of the year honors . &quot; ( Pinciroli ) was our best defensive and offensive player , &quot; Stoll said . &quot; But Marco was very good , too. &quot; Avanzi also came_to California to improve his English and was disappointed he was unable to play . But he believes his presence in practices contributed to El Toro ' s success . &quot; I think I helped the team to improve a lot , &quot; Avanzi said . &quot; I wish I could have played , but my main goal here was to learn English. &quot; Pinciroli was a Brazilian junior national team member for two years , but said the section championship was unlike any victory he has experienced . &quot; I ' ll never forget that game , &quot; he said . &quot; It was more exciting because I wasn ' t going_to see the team together again. &quot; And he won ' t soon forget winning the MVP award . &quot; I wasn ' t expecting that , &quot; he said . &quot; This is working very good for me. &quot; Things could continue to work well for him here because college recruiters have shown interest . But unlike some foreign athletes who come_to the United States , he doesn ' t plan to stay for college , not immediately anyway . He hopes to return to Brazil in March and try_out for the national team -- as will Avanzi -- for a chance to compete at this summer ' s Pan American Games . Come September , he will enroll in a Brazilian university . &quot; It ' s a big deal for me to be_on the national team , &quot; Pinciroli said . &quot; I want to try_for the Pan Am Games and possibly the Olympic Games . I ' ll start college in Brazil , then maybe I ' ll come_back here or go_to Italy. &quot; In the meantime , his time here has been time well spent , in and out of the pool . His English is much improved , as is his water_polo game . In Brazil , water_polo is played only at the club level . Here , where quality high_school and college teams abound , Pinciroli has been able to test himself more regularly . &quot; The ( water_polo ) style here is different , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s more physical in Brazil ; it ' s more technical here . I ' ve improved a lot here . I ' ve learned a lot . It ' s been great. &quot;</TEXT>
