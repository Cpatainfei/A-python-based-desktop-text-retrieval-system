   <HEADLINE> WINTER_OLYMPICS / NOTEBOOK ; U.S. TEAM PICKS MYLER TO CARRY THE FLAG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cammy Myler of Lake Placid , N.Y. , three-time Olympian in women ' s luge competition , will carry the flag for the U.S. team Saturday in the opening ceremony . Myler was elected by her American teammates Thursday . Others nominated were speedskaters Bonnie Blair , Kristin Talbot and Dan Jansen , and mogul skier Donna Weinbrecht . Blair and Weinbrecht are former gold medalists . &quot; I think this is really special , that the athletes , my peers , elected me to be the one to embody the Olympic spirit at the opening ceremony , &quot; Myler said . &quot; It ' s extra-special because my brother ( Tim ) is in the hospital ( with cancer ) and my entire family won ' t be able to be here , but they will definitely see me now. &quot; * Ole Gunnar Fidjestol , a Norwegian who was to have sailed off the ski_jump carrying the Olympic torch during the opening ceremony , was injured in practice and will miss what would have been his big moment . Fidjestol suffered a concussion and a twisted neck when he fell and was hospitalized for observation . Reserve jumper Stein Gruben will take Fidjestol ' s place in the opening ceremony . * Vegard Ulvang vs . Juan Antonio Samaranch and the International Olympic Committee continues , on a less acrimonious note . Ulvang , Norwegian cross-country skier and national hero , had criticized Samaranch on Norwegian TV for his ties to the old Franco government of Spain and ripping the IOC for what Ulvang said was a lack of democracy . This sparked a rumor that Ulvang would not be reciting the Olympic oath on behalf of the athletes at the opening ceremony , as scheduled . Recent developments : -- Ulvang ' s critical statements were taped more_than a month ago , six days before he knew he would be giving the oath . He did know , however , that the interview was being taped and would be shown on Feb . 8 , according to Norwegian TV2 . -- It was not Ulvang ' s intention to attack Samaranch personally , but rather to criticize the IOC , according to Gerhard Heiberg , president of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee . Heiberg also said he accepted responsibility for the interview . -- Ulvang apologized to Samaranch at a meeting Thursday and invited Samaranch to dinner . Samaranch , in turn , invited Ulvang to discussions on the work of the IOC . -- No one , other_than rumor mongers , has said that Ulvang will not be allowed to deliver the oath . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
