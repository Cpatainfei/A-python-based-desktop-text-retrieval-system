   <HEADLINE> BRINGING CALIFORNIA ' S SCHOOLS INTO THE 21ST CENTURY ; THE TIMES INVITED GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES PETE WILSON , THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT , AND DEMOCRAT KATHLEEN BROWN TO DISCUSS KEY ISSUES IN THE 1994 ELECTION . TODAY THE FOCUS IS_ON EDUCATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Improving our schools will take fundamental change . Our schools must again become safe havens where we can teach our children the skills they ' ll need to compete in the workplace of the 21st Century . I ' ve launched significant reforms to achieve this goal , but for these or any education reforms to work , they must include immigration reform . The outrage in education today is that , despite already overcrowded classrooms and too tight budgets , there are 400 # 000 illegal immigrants enrolled in California ' s public_schools . that ' s enough people to fill more_than 650 elementary_schools . But President Clinton refuses to secure California ' s borders . And Kathleen Brown says that taxpayers should continue footing the bill for illegal immigrants in our schools . In fact , in a major speech on the subject , Brown said that &quot; illegal immigration is wrongly seen as a cause &quot; of problems in California . The truth is , we ' ll never completely fix our schools until we reform this absurd system of illegal immigration . With the $ 1.5 billion California will spend on education for illegal immigrants this year , we could put a computer on the desk of every fifth-grader in the state , enroll 225 # 000 4-year-olds in preschool , expand by 1 # 500 sites our Healthy Start program for counseling troubled kids and pay_for 20 million hours of training and mentoring for at-risk youths . Money is already tight enough ; even Treasurer Brown recognizes that . In fact , despite her partisan sniping , she didn ' t propose a single dollar more_than I did for education this year . And while she doesn ' t recognize it , the key to freeing up more money for the education of legal residents is reducing the cost we ' re forced to bear for illegal immigration . That will allow our other reforms to make a real difference in schools . These are some of the reforms I ' m working_on : * Drug-free , violence-free schools . Students can ' t learn and teachers can ' t teach in schools infested by drugs , gangs or guns . We just won a change in the law to try the worst juvenile criminals as adults , because vicious thugs deserve stiff sentences no matter how old they are . I also borrowed a successful idea from Long_Beach to bring school uniforms to more public_schools . Long_Beach found that uniforms help limit gang violence and improve discipline . When it comes_to violence in the classroom , we need a policy of zero tolerance . Someone who brings a gun to school should face just one thing -- mandatory expulsion . On the other hand , when Brown served on the Los Angeles school_board , she joined the American Civil Liberties Union in trying to block police from using undercover officers to combat drug dealing in the schools . * Computers in the classroom . In the age of computer chips , too many of our students are stuck_in schools from the age of Mr. Chips . To fix that , the Public_Utilities Commission , at my request , just allocated more_than $ 40 million as a down_payment to start connecting every classroom in California to the information superhighway , beginning this year . * Freeing schools from red_tape . I created charter schools two years ago to return greater control to parents and teachers , freeing them from stifling bureaucratic red_tape . But I want to make_it easier for communities to launch these break-the-mold schools by giving parents a bigger role in their creation . * Bringing parents back to school . For schools to succeed , parents must take an active role in their children ' s education . that ' s one reason I signed the nation ' s most ambitious school-choice plan last year . Thousands of Los Angeles parents are now choosing the public_school they think is best for their child . We also need a Parents Bill of Rights giving parents greater oversight over schools and the opportunity to monitor their children ' s classes . Education can ' t be left to teachers alone . Parents have an obligation to take an active role . Our schools and our kids will have a greater future if we have the courage to make fundamental change -- including illegal immigration reform . Powerful special_interests who back Brown oppose many of these reforms , but we can ' t afford to let our kids fall victim to partisan politics . I ' ve reached across partisan lines to enact job reforms and tougher criminal_laws . We must do the same to save California schools . It ' s the very least our children deserve .</TEXT>
