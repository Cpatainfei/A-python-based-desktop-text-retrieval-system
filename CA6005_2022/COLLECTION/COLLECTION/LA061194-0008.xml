   <TEXT> The explosion heard in the skies over Kigali at 9:40 on the night of April 6 caused no great alarm . The capital had been tense for weeks , and the sounds of grenades and rifle fire hardly made anyone flinch anymore . &quot; Nothing to worry about . Probably just thunder , &quot; Phillippe Lambiliotte , a Belgian businessman , reassured his wife . The night was thick_with humidity and heat and more silent than usual . Lambiliotte remembers hearing a dog bark . He went_to_sleep wondering if someone was moving_around in the dark . Someone was , and by morning the disembowelment of a luckless country had begun . Guided by government troops , gangs of young thugs with clubs , machetes and spears rampaged through Kigali , hunting_down members of the Tutsi tribe that until the 1950s had ruled the rival Hutus for centuries as feudal overlords . At first , they chose their targets selectively , matching addresses with names on lists they carried ; then , exhilarated by their thoroughness , they began killing anyone they felt_like killing . While the government-sponsored radio_station RTLM exhorted , &quot; Kill the Tutsis or they will kill you , &quot; the organized gangs of marauders went block by block doing just that . On one street_corner , a Tutsi child lay wounded . A soldier shouted something to a woman nearby . She raised a club that bristled with protruding nails and sank it into the boy ' s skull . &quot; I feel guilt for what I have done , but I must tell you I do not feel responsible , &quot; the woman , Muliana Mukanyarwaya , 36 , later told reporters . &quot; I was only carrying_out orders. &quot; It was not until noon on the first day of killing that the now-panicked populace of Rwanda learned that the nighttime thunderclap heard over Kigali was the explosion of President Juvenal Habyarimana ' s plane , struck by a rocket as it approached the airport . His death in the resulting crash , African diplomats said , put into effect a master_plan that in genocidal scope and intensity would rival the horrors of Pol Pot ' s Cambodia in the mid-1970s . What has happened in Rwanda over the last two months -- several hundreds of thousands killed and 2 million made homeless -- may say no more about Africa as_a_whole than Bosnia does about Europe . Yet the tragedy could perhaps have been averted had Rwanda learned from the post-independence traumas of its neighbors : A security_force whose allegiance is to a party or a tribe is a weapon that at some point will be used -- at whatever cost -- to subjugate the very people it is pledged to defend . Most African armies , such_as Rwanda ' s , are trained not to safeguard borders from external threats but to protect a ruling hierarchy . They are , as happened here , tools of leaders unwilling to share power as the price for peace , because to share the spoils of authority , in a society once dominated by chiefs and kings , is to suffer the ultimate indignity of no longer being boss . So every conflict -- such_as that between the Hutus and Tutsis -- becomes a winner-take-all confrontation . That is a suicidal course in countries like Rwanda , where political pluralism is a murky concept and the judicial_system is paralyzed , offering the guilty no fear of prosecution and the aggrieved no hope of compensation . The result is that violence becomes an authorized function of state , often &quot; privatized &quot; in the hands of party militias . The first Tutsis who migrated to central_Africa with their cattle , probably from the Nile , were tall and slim , with thin lips , high foreheads and aquiline noses . Though a minority , the Tutsis ruled the short , stocky Hutus , a farming people of Bantu ethnicity , under a medieval system known as buhake , offering protection in return for a share of Hutu crops and services . Eventually buhake became synonymous with servitude . Belgian colonialists reinforced the caste_system by favoring the Tutsis in education , commerce , government and security . In 1959 , three years before independence , the Hutus overthrew their masters , killing an estimated 100 # 000 Tutsis . The slaughters continued periodically for five years and prompted English philosopher Bertrand Russell to call them &quot; the most horrible and systematic human massacre we have had occasion to witness since the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis. &quot; Meanwhile , in neighboring Burundi , which had once been part of Rwanda , the Tutsi minority had come_up with a solution to end ethnic competition . In 1972 , it set_out to kill every Hutu who had an education , a government job or money . Within three months , the death toll reached 200 # 000 . Hutu bodies were thrown into the uncovered cargo holds of military trucks and driven through Bujumbura in broad daylight until the capital had become as empty_of Hutus as Warsaw was of Jews after World_War_II . So subservient and obedient had the Hutus become to their Tutsi masters that they answered summonses to appear at local police_stations , where much of the killing was taking_place . Sometimes when the death quotas had been filled , the police sent the Hutus home_in the afternoon , with instructions to return the next day . Almost all did . Today in Rwanda , it is the Tutsis who are the vulnerable ones , controlling neither the government nor the military . By April 10 , the violence had swept north , leaving flattened villages and murdered and maimed women and children in its wake before reaching this quiet little hillside town , a two-hour drive from Kigali . The one-story stucco hospital in Gahini was built_in 1927 , at the end of a dirt road . Rob Watson , a British doctor , was performing surgery in the operating room the evening the mob came_up the road with its machetes . His Rwandan staff of nurses stood bravely at the door and tried to face down the wild-eyed assailants with words of reason . They were pushed_aside . As calmly as if they were_on a mission to visit the ill , the young killers went from bed to bed , looking_for anyone with Tutsi features . &quot; In the name of God . . . &quot; a nurse said . One of the youths ignored her and plunged his machete into the stomach of a female patient . One group tried to barge into the operating room , but Watson put his shoulder against the door and managed to lock it . Later , the surgery successfully completed , he entered the courtyard where the killers were still milling_about , and he had a chilling realization : He knew these men . They were the jobless youths he passed almost every day , the idle ones in Gahini who always looked so bored and so in need of something to do . According to numerous Rwandans interviewed here and in Tanzania , the youths recruited by Habyarimana ' s National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development to help the army and presidential guard carry_out the massacres were formed into two groups : the Interahamwe ( Those Who Stand Together ) and the Impuza Mugambi ( The Single-Minded Ones ) . They were paid $ 3.50 a day and were drawn from the ranks of the uneducated , unemployed young_men who hang_out on the street_corners of all African cities . Their presence is worrisome to every African_nation , and none more so than this unfortunate place best known , until April 6 , as the home of the late naturalist Dian Fossey ( who was murdered here ) and some of the last mountain_gorillas on Earth . In a &quot; dual society &quot; such_as Rwanda ' s , with only two ethnic_groups vying for power , idleness combined with overcrowding and other obstacles to development can be a prescription for hatred at close quarters , says Ali Mazrui , an African political_scientist . With nearly 8 million people , Rwanda is the world ' s most densely populated nation . It had , before the recent foreign exodus , five times more missionaries ( 903 ) than physicians ( 177 ) . It has the highest birthrate in the world , with each woman bearing an average of 8.6 children . Life_expectancy is 47 years , and of every 1 # 000 Rwandans born , 189 will die before they turn 5 . One-third of the adults in Kigali , the World_Health_Organization says , are believed to have what is referred to in Rwanda as &quot; the famous disease &quot; -- AIDS . Nonetheless , by the mid-1980s , Rwanda was being hailed by the World_Bank as a model African_country . It had made economic reforms , and Habyarimana , who had seized power in a 1973 coup , was paying at least lip_service to the need for ethnic conciliation . John Blane , the U.S. ambassador here in 1982-85 , managed to get Rwanda special U.S. economic development funds as a reward for its progress . &quot; I found the Rwandans to be the nicest , sweetest , most inoffensive people I ' ve ever met , &quot; Blane said by telephone from Washington . &quot; I didn ' t feel there was any nastiness in them at all . I never would have suspected something like this could happen . Oh sure , I heard some Tutsi complaints that they weren ' t getting a fair share , but those complaints were never at a very high pitch. &quot; When Oscar and Eugenia Giordano , an American couple , arrived in Rwanda in 1991 on their first African missionary assignment , they remember seeing their new home_in Mugonero , 100 miles south of Kigali , and thought that they had reached paradise . The hospital and church each stood on small hills , and in the valley between them was their house , its porch offering a superb view of Lake Kivu below . Now , in the middle of April , three years later , Oscar Giordano was careening alone in his Trooper away from Kigali , where he had been trapped by the fighting , and back to his hospital and wife . He remembered the eerily prophetic words of a sermon he had delivered just days earlier : &quot; If you want to give your life to Jesus , this might be your last opportunity. &quot; In the last 20 miles of his journey , through a valley in the shadow of death , he saw in the approaching darkness not a car , not a person , not a light . &quot; Never before , in three years , have I seen an African road with nobody on it , &quot; he said . But in Mugonero a welcome sight awaited him : The hospital , the church , his home and wife and three daughters were safe . A menacing gang of 60 or 70 men had approached the hospital the day before with machetes . They had come_to the dirt road in front of the compound , then miraculously turned_back . The night of Giordano ' s return , grenades were thrown into the compound , and the next morning the Giordanos packed four small suitcases and joined a convoy of Swiss and French nationals to Zaire , leaving_behind the hospital where the two doctors and their staff of 75 Rwandans had cared last year for 20 # 000 patients , conducted 980 operations and delivered 405 babies . Their last communications with the staff was by telephone at 4 p.m. on April 13 . &quot; They ' re coming_to attack us again ! &quot; shouted the voice on the other end of the line . &quot; They ' re coming again now ! &quot; In retrospect , the Giordanos now know , it had been clear for some time that the framework was being built for Rwanda ' s ultimate moment of horror . Since October , 1990 , when the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front had launched a civil_war , Africa Watch and other human_rights organizations had documented the deaths of hundreds of innocents -- mostly Tutsis and members of political_parties opposed to Habyarimana -- and had called_for urgent reforms and a halt to the arming of civilians . The ill-disciplined , often drunken army had gotten so out of hand that Habyarimana -- who frequently had denied that his military was guilty of any excesses -- called senior commanders together in Ruhengeri in March , 1993 , and said , &quot; It is always a bitter experience for me to have to castigate certain soldiers for their behavior ; they are not many , but how destructive are their actions when they abuse innocent people by pillage , rape and all kinds of vandalism. &quot; Five months later , in Arusha , Tanzania , Habyarimana signed a peace agreement with the rebels designed to lead to a broad-based transitional government and democratic elections . That accord may have sealed the president ' s fate , and Rwanda ' s . His assassination and the chaos that followed , it is widely believed , were the work of extremists in his own party who believed that Habyarimana had &quot; gone soft_on the Tutsi problem &quot; and who were determined to derail the Arusha Accords . The extremists are primarily Hutus from the north , the home region of Habyarimana ' s Bushin clan . They are at_odds with both the Tutsis and the more moderate southern Hutus who favor ethnic power-sharing . Benedict Ndagijimana , a college freshman majoring in English , is among the hundreds of thousands of Rwandans to flee the extremists and their mindless youth militias . Many of his friends are dead . He is not sure his parents survived . For the last two weeks of his monthlong flight to Tanzania , he hid in bushes and foraged for food . His clothes were so badly ripped by thorns and vines that he was left nearly naked . He felt , he said , that he had returned to the Africa of a century ago . By mid-May , Ndagijimana had reached safety in Tanzania ' s Benaco refugee camp -- part of what the United Nations said was the &quot; fastest , youngest &quot; exodus of people across a border in modern times . Dressed in tattered , secondhand clothes , he had gone_in a month ' s time from being a member of the privileged elite to some undefined status below the bottom rung on the class scale . How could this happen ? he was asked : &quot; It is not complicated . People who cannot read and do not have access to television believe what the government tells them on the radio . That becomes truth . They hear over and over that the Tutsis are out_to kill them , and that is reality . So they act not ( so_much ) out of hate as fear . They think they have only the choice to kill or be killed. &quot; And what of Rwanda ? &quot; Rwanda is dead , &quot; he said . &quot; For my generation at least. &quot; Lamb was recently on assignment in Rwanda .</TEXT>
