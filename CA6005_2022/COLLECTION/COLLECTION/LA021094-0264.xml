   <HEADLINE> CANCELLATION OF BUS_SERVICE FRUSTRATES RIDERS ; TRANSIT : SANTA CLARITA TO RELY ON METROLINK , WHICH SOME COMMUTERS SAY IS MORE COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the bright_blue and white Metrolink trains blossomed with thousands of new passengers in the wake of the highway-buckling Northridge earthquake , an older commuter transit service connecting Santa Clarita and Los Angeles went dormant -- to the frustration of its loyal riders . Prior to the Jan . 17 quake , Santa Clarita operated a commuter bus_service into Los Angeles . It made nine daily runs , cost less to ride per month than Metrolink , had a shorter travel_time for most passengers than the rail system and -- originally handled by the county -- had been around for more_than 13 years . &quot; that ' s why we ' re upset about the city unilaterally deciding to cancel the service , &quot; said John Burmahln , who has ridden the commuter bus_line since 1980 . Santa Clarita canceled the bus program , looking_to the 15-month-old Metrolink rail service for out-of-town transit needs and focusing city resources on the dozens of other problems created by the earthquake . Bus riders say they understood temporarily stopping the program when the disaster struck and roadways were closed or clogged , but insist it could have been restored by now if city officials weren ' t trying to pack Metrolink trains and provide unnecessary rides in the San Fernando Valley . &quot; I think they bureaucratically raped us , &quot; said Mark Smith , who moved to Santa Clarita from Burbank two years ago . &quot; The reason I moved_out there is there was going_to be flexible transportation in ( to L.A. ) , &quot; said Smith . &quot; I ' ve simply lost that with this arrangement. &quot; Commuter buses are scheduled to resume operation March 1 . Transit officials say the system is not being ignored and that time is needed to prepare_for additional riders expected to take the service once it resumes . &quot; The fact that riders are loyal and want the service returned is a testament to what we were doing , &quot; said Ron Kilcoyne , city transportation manager . Kilcoyne acknowledged six of the nine commuter buses have been running instead to the San Fernando Valley since last week -- three to Chatsworth and three to Warner Center -- and others are being used to shuttle Metrolink passengers . Santa Clarita has purchased four buses to supplement the commuter line when it reopens . Kilcoyne said the city is looking_to contract_out for continued transit service to Chatsworth , Warner Center and Van Nuys . Meanwhile , commuter bus riders say Metrolink is not a fair alternative for traveling_to Los Angeles . &quot; It is different in that it costs more money , takes more time and it ' s not as comfortable , &quot; said Kevin Corcoran , a bus rider since 1985 . Monthly Metrolink passes from Santa Clarita are $ 144 per month , as compared to $ 100 for the commuter bus . &quot; Last week I was so tired_of the train I drove my car , and I hadn ' t driven to work in six months , &quot; Corcoran said . &quot; Metrolink put me into a car ; it didn ' t take me out of one. &quot; Burmahln said his one-hour commute time has doubled using Metrolink and that only a handful of people are taking buses into the Valley . &quot; Why they would force 400 patrons who never rode the train , ( never ) wanted the train , ( never ) asked_for the train , to get_off so they could use our buses , I don ' t know , &quot; Burmahln said .</TEXT>
