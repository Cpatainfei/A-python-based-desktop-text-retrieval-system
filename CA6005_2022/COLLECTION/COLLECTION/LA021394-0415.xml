   <HEADLINE> SOUTH GATE , HAMILTON RUNNERS IN OLYMPIC TORCH RELAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Humberto Sanchez of South Gate High and Genevieve DeBose of Hamilton High participated in the Olympic Torch Relay Feb . 5 , part of a 5 # 000-mile relay that ended Saturday at the Winter Olympic opening ceremonies in Lillehammer , Norway . Sanchez , 18 , and DeBose , 16 , both seniors , were two of five U.S. runners chosen by the International Torch Bearers program , which included participants from outside the host country for the first time at the Winter Games . But rather than his 500-meter leg on the 7 # 000-person relay , his first exposure to subfreezing weather or his first airplane flight , Sanchez said the friendships he developed were the most memorable part of his four-day trip . &quot; It was a whole new experience , &quot; Sanchez said . &quot; It was a great honor to meet the other runners , and we stuck_together like one big family . that ' s the one thing I do remember. &quot; DeBose , who lives_in South-Central , was impressed by the cultural diversity she encountered : &quot; The Norwegians spoke a lot of English and some spoke a little Spanish but I was able to communicate with runners from Japan who did not speak English . I learned you don ' t have to speak the same language to become friends. &quot; DeBose and Sanchez were selected to participate in the Olympic Torch Relay after their performances in the City Section cross-country finals last November . DeBose became her school ' s first runner to win the title . Participating in his first season of cross-country , Sanchez finished second in the boys ' race and went_on to place 11th in the State Division I finals -- the highest finish ever by a South Gate runner .</TEXT>
