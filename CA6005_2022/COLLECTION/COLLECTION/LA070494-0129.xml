   <HEADLINE> ANTI-IMMIGRANT MOOD HELPS FUEL CITIZENSHIP RISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They hailed from more_than 100 nations worldwide , a diverse gathering even by the polyglot standards of today ' s Los Angeles . Many were euphoric , some teary-eyed , others solemn . Most clutched tiny red , white and blue_flags provided_for the occasion . Among them was Alejandro Navarro , a onetime illegal border-jumper from Mexico , who , like the others , came_to swear allegiance to the Stars and Stripes . &quot; We feel more American than those who were born here , &quot; said Navarro , one of 14 # 000 immigrants who became citizens during a Los Angeles Convention Center ceremony last month . &quot; We ' re American by_choice , by conviction. &quot; Looking_for a powerful , and old-fashioned , way to assert their rights , immigrants throughout the country are signing_up for citizenship in near-record numbers . More_than 425 # 000 immigrants nationwide are expected to become citizens this fiscal_year , rivaling a 50-year-old record set during a period of wartime anxiety . In the Los Angeles area , 90 # 000 immigrants will probably turn_in green_cards for naturalization certificates -- almost double the number last year . The surge in citizenship sign-ups reflects the peak immigration levels of the past decade , a period that has seen more newcomers -- both legal and illegal -- arrive on U.S. soil than during any other stretch in history . But propelling citizenship interest now , say observers and immigrants , is a distinctly political factor : fear of fallout from what many call an anti-immigrant backlash , particularly in California . With Gov . Pete Wilson attacking illegal immigrants and legislators seeking cutbacks in aid for lawful immigrants , many have hastened to sign_up for citizenship -- and the opportunity to vote . &quot; We are being attacked as government dependents , but most of us are hard-working , &quot; said Alfonso Gutierrez , a Mexican-born factory foreman who is applying for citizenship . &quot; For me , the most important thing is the vote , the opportunity to have a say in this country. &quot; Immigrant advocates have launched aggressive citizenship sign-up drives -- at churches , on television and radio , house-to-house and in the streets . Bus benches in Los Angeles ' heavily Latino neighborhoods carry the message : Ciudadania , la mejor via ( &quot; Citizenship , the best way &quot; ) . Courses in English_language and U.S. history and civics are booming , reflecting immigrants ' desire to satisfy requirements for naturalization . A record 6 # 200 students are crammed into citizenship classes offered by the Los Angeles Unified School District . Citizenship registration is expected to swell over the next year or more as eligibility kicks_in for most of the more_than 3 million onetime illegal immigrants -- more_than one of four residents of greater Los Angeles -- who gained amnesty beginning in 1987 . Some fear that the ever-lengthening queue at U.S. immigration offices will overwhelm an already slow-moving process , extending delays . &quot; Will the capacity be there to respond ? &quot; asked Frank Sharry , executive_director of the National Immigration Forum , a Washington-based umbrella group of advocate organizations . &quot; If not , people get frustrated . It will be a lost opportunity. &quot; The Clinton_Administration is seeking an additional $ 30 million to add citizenship staff and streamline and further automate what is often an intimidating and burdensome process for applicants . The House reduced the amount to $ 7.5 million , and the proposal is pending in the Senate . Declaring that U.S. officials have historically been too passive in promoting citizenship , Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner has pledged to foster citizenship as an instrument of national harmony during an era of growing anti-immigrant sentiment . &quot; The naturalization process is a continuing reaffirmation that newcomers want to join up , that they do , by and large , share the values that those of us who came_before share , &quot; said Meissner , the daughter of naturalized German-born parents . &quot; I think that does help to ameliorate some of the tensions around immigration. &quot; While Latino leaders and immigrant advocates have praised the commissioner ' s championing of citizen sign-ups , lawmakers and others pushing for limits on new immigrants are wary . Some oppose stepped-up naturalization efforts because citizens can more easily bring_in relatives from abroad . &quot; Citizenship , &quot; said Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) , &quot; should not be a priority for INS during a time when we are being smothered by an avalanche of illegal immigration. &quot; The boom in citizenship enrollments has buoyed activists ' hopes for a united front against perceived immigrant-bashing . But it would be a mistake to take new citizens ' views for granted . Polls have shown many Latinos to be as disturbed about illegal immigration as non-Latinos . A voter registration booth run_by the Republican_Party did a brisk business after the mass swearing-in at the Convention Center last month . Alejandro Navarro , who was arrested by immigration authorities in a Los Angeles shoe factory three decades ago and sent_back to Mexico , now finds himself agreeing with Gov . Wilson . &quot; Some people come here and just don ' t want to work , &quot; Navarro , a father of four U.S.-born children , declared after taking his citizenship oath . His wife , Mariana Navarro , who renounced her Mexican citizenship alongside her husband , sees it otherwise . &quot; The governor is generalizing against all Latinos , &quot; she said . &quot; Immigrants work more_than anyone else in this country. &quot; Decidedly nonpolitical factors -- cost , convenience , job opportunities and other personal motivations -- also impel many immigrants to become citizens . ( Immigrants are eligible for citizenship after five years of legal residence , or three years if married to U.S. nationals. ) Along with the right_to_vote , citizens are entitled to serve on juries and hold jobs restricted to citizens only , including many positions in government and law_enforcement . Among the recent new citizens is Hung Tri Tran , a 19-year-old Navy_man and Saigon native assigned to an aircraft_carrier . Tran , one of the thousands of Southeast Asian &quot; boat people &quot; who made their way to the United States by enduring high_seas and attacks by pirates , saw his status hindering his career advancement . &quot; I want to be an officer , &quot; Tran , dressed in his Navy whites , explained shortly after receiving his citizenship papers at the Convention Center . For Alejandro Espinoza , citizenship is a practical matter . The 68-year-old father of four , originally from Mexico , is among longtime U.S. residents now required to turn_in their old green_cards for new ones . The cost is $ 70 for a document that must be renewed every 10 years . Becoming a citizen costs $ 20 more -- and is permanent unless renounced . &quot; I ' d rather get_it all taken_care of at once and not lose any more time , &quot; Espinoza said . Hector Espinoza ( no relation ) , a 36-year-old auto parts salesman in Gardena , offers another reason : He wants to petition for his father to come_to the United States from Mexico . But , along with the practical considerations , both Espinozas and Tran express desires to formalize their allegiance to their adopted land and gain voting privileges . &quot; This is a great nation , and I want to be a part of it , &quot; said Hector Espinoza , who emigrated illegally from Mexico in 1979 and later gained amnesty . &quot; My vote could make a difference. &quot; Notwithstanding the advantages of citizenship , recent waves of immigrants -- particularly those from Mexico -- have generally eschewed the privilege . Only slightly more_than one-third of legal immigrants apply for citizenship today , considerably lower than the rate earlier in the century , officials say . Yet peak immigration levels are pushing raw citizenship numbers ever higher . Sign-up rates vary dramatically depending_on nationality . Asians traditionally have high naturalization rates -- another important reason why sign-ups have swollen in recent years as Asian immigration and refugee flows have increased . About 60 % of Filipinos and 58 % of Chinese , for instance , apply for citizenship , according to a government study of immigrants who arrived in 1977 . In contrast , only 16 % of eligible immigrants from Mexico seek U.S. citizenship , the study found . Traditionally , officials have explained that Mexican citizens are wary of renouncing their homeland , often clinging_to an illusion of going_back , even after their lives take_root and children are born in the United States . But others see low sign-up rates as a product of a confusing , costly and often intimidating citizenship application process . Applicants must pay a $ 90 fee and fill_out a four-page form , which asks a bewildering array of personal questions in English . Aspiring citizens are queried as_to whether they ' ve been Nazis , Communists , narcotics traffickers , prostitutes , gamblers , drunkards , tax cheats , deserters or polygamists . During a subsequent interview , applicants must demonstrate an ability to speak and understand English -- some longtime residents older than 50 are exempted from this requirement -- and pass a history / civics test that encompasses themes from the obscure to the relevant , including : Name five of the first original 13 states . Who is your congressman ? Who wrote &quot; The Star-Spangled Banner ? &quot; Many regard the citizenship process as hostile , particularly since the crucial interview is conducted by INS officers , who have long embodied newcomers ' worst fears . &quot; I ' m hoping my English is good_enough , &quot; said Juan Jose Ugarte , an industrial painter who has been traveling between the United States and his native Mexico for more_than 30 years . An amnesty recipient , Ugarte has little empathy for fellow immigrants who hesitate to become citizens based on a misplaced nostalgia for the old_country . Ugarte tells the story of a beloved uncle who lived_in California for 40 years , fathered nine children , but always insisted that he would go_back to Mexico . The uncle died a_few years ago -- in Los Angeles , where he is buried . &quot; When I visit his grave , &quot; Ugarte recalled with a smile , &quot; I tell him , ' See uncle , you never did make_it back ! ' &quot; The reluctance among many to apply for citizenship also stems , in part , from apprehensions grounded both in fact and fiction . Some fear a loss of land ownership and other rights back home if they acquire U.S. passports -- and , indeed , Mexico , South_Korea and other nations limit the ownership rights of non-citizens . A widely circulated , albeit apocryphal , tale : Mexicans must stomp on their flag during swearing-in ceremonies . &quot; That rumor still persists , &quot; said Domingo Rodriguez , coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District ' s adult citizenship programs . &quot; I heard it back in the 1940s within my own family. &quot; Some longtime immigrants , such_as Graciela Liceaga , simply refuse to cut legal ties to home . Liceaga , a 34-year-old amnesty recipient and mother of four U.S.-born children , said she still hoped to return to her hometown near Guadalajara , away from the crime , fractured family life and lack of traditional values that she sees in her Eastside neighborhood . She has no plans to become a U.S. citizen , though she is eligible . &quot; I don ' t want to grow old here , &quot; Liceaga said recently after an English-language class , which she is taking_to improve her ability to speak with her children ' s teachers . &quot; Here , one can be so alone. &quot; In an effort to promote citizenship , immigrant advocates steer newcomers through the procedural morass . Staffers interview citizen-aspirants , assist them in filling_out forms , take the required photographs and fingerprints , help set_up appointments and arrange for instruction in English and civics . Latino leaders express hope that expanded citizenship rolls will help boost the community ' s political clout -- from school_board level to Capitol_Hill . Noting that elections in some of the region ' s small , heavily Latino cities are decided by fewer than 1 # 000 votes , Harry Pachon , head of the Tomas Rivera Center , said , &quot; I ' ll bet there are city_council members and mayors looking_at these ( citizenship ) figures with trepidation. &quot; In Los Angeles , INS officials have bolstered citizenship staffs by one-third , and , in a pilot_project to be launched this week , plan to interview would-be citizens on the grounds of a church -- a striking contrast to what many consider the threatening ambience of INS offices . However , officials besieged with an ever-expanding volume of requests have pointedly refrained_from aggressively advertising naturalization efforts . &quot; If I promote it too_much , I overwhelm my system , &quot; said Richard K . Rogers , INS district director . Citizenship applications from the Los Angeles region have surged from fewer than 200 a day last fall to more_than 500 daily now , as initial waves of amnesty immigrants begin signing_up . ( The first amnesty beneficiaries only became eligible for citizenship last fall. ) Experts have long theorized that amnesty recipients will be more likely to seek citizenship than other immigrants . Most have lived here since at least 1982 , and many were already required to study English and U.S._government and history . &quot; The amnesty people have already gone_through the process , they know they don ' t have to face the INS alone , &quot; said Jose de Paz , who heads the California Immigrant Workers Assn. , a community and labor group that is encouraging people to sign_up for citizenship . De Paz himself finally became a citizen last month , though he has lived_in the United States for 28 years and is the father of three U.S.-born children . &quot; I ' ve convinced hundreds of people to become citizens , &quot; said the Mexican native , &quot; so I felt I had to do_it myself. &quot; Despite optimistic forecasts about citizenship registrations among amnesty beneficiaries , initial figures show those from Mexico still lag behind other immigrants in becoming U.S. citizens . That shortfall is potentially significant because Mexican nationals account_for almost three-quarters of all amnesty recipients . But Latino scholars say they expect that the number of Mexican immigrants seeking citizenship to rise as word of the opportunity spreads . Alfonso Gutierrez , the factory foreman who is also an amnesty immigrant , can ' t wait to get his citizenship papers . Along with his desire to vote and participate in the democratic process , Gutierrez , 30 , wants to petition to bring his wife from Mexico . &quot; This is my country now , &quot; Gutierrez said the other day after filling_out his application at an East Los Angeles clinic . &quot; I want to be able to stand_up for the interests of my community. &quot; Citizenship Applications Applications for U.S. citizenship have increased dramatically at the Los Angeles office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- from a daily average of 182 in October to a daily average of more_than 500 for each of the last three months . The office serves a seven-county region of Southern California . 02 # 15 , 14 Daily Average Applications 10-93 182 11-93 306 12-93 294 1-94 353 2-94 398 3-94 493 4-94 519 5-94 568 6-94 545 Source : U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service</TEXT>
