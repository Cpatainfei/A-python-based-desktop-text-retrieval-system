   <HEADLINE> SANDBAR BREACHED AT WETLANDS ; WILDLIFE : HEAVY RAINS DISRUPT HABITAT OF ENDANGERED SPECIES AT ORMOND BEACH . SOME BLAME DEVELOPMENT FOR TAMPERING WITH THE AREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Left to its own devices , nature was more disruptive to the endangered species of Ormond Beach than a developer who pumped water from the area ' s pristine lagoons : storm runoff has now ruptured a sandbar and drained the wetlands . The sudden breach surprised representatives of the Baldwin Co. , who had spent about $ 40 # 000 siphoning water from their Ormond property , and environmentalists , who had argued that the sensitive habitat be left alone . Ironically , officials from the Ventura County Flood_Control District were laying a pipe to drain water from the area last Friday when they noticed it was already escaping into the sea . The breach was caused , they said , by last week ' s heavy rains . &quot; Rainwater caused the lagoon to fill_up . . . , &quot; said John Correa , an engineer for the flood_control district . &quot; High_tide and the water_level in the lagoon caused the sandbar to break . The lagoon drained down in a big hurry. &quot; Without human intervention , the sandbar would break every two or three years , according to state officials . The sandbar will take about six months to rebuild itself . * In recent years , the district had bulldozed the sandbar each spring to cut an outlet for the lagoon , which captures water from Oxnard storm drains and Port Hueneme ' s Bubbling Springs Creek . But the district stopped the practice this year after environmentalists noted the presence of the endangered least tern , tidewater goby fish and other fragile wildlife . Those species were undoubtedly harmed by the breach , environmentalists said , although they could not quantify the damage . Some also said that last week ' s break would not have occurred if Baldwin had not tampered with the wetlands in the first place . &quot; If Baldwin had not pumped all that water . . . it would not have breached , &quot; said Jean Harris of the Ormond Beach Observers . &quot; It wasn ' t just nature that did it. &quot; Alan Sanders of the Sierra Club said that nothing that happens at Ormond Beach can be considered natural anymore because there has been so_much human contact in the area . &quot; There has been so_much tampering with the ecological system down there , &quot; Sanders said . &quot; A lot of the activity lately , like the Baldwin Co . pumping the wetlands , is related to this. &quot; Louis Malone , president of the Baldwin Co. ' s Ventura and Los Angeles County division , angrily dismissed those charges . &quot; I think that ' s totally preposterous , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s a cheap shot. &quot; * Carrie Phillips , a coastal biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , said the rupture is part of the normal ebb and flow of a wetlands area . There seemed to be no reason to suspect it was caused by human contact , she said . &quot; As far as we know , the pressure got too high and blew ( the sandbar ) out , &quot; Phillips said . &quot; It was a very productive area that was being used by a lot of sensitive species. &quot; Two weeks ago , the California Coastal Commission ordered the Irvine-based Baldwin Co . to stop pumping the wetlands without a permit or face fines of up_to $ 6 # 000 a day . The company eventually did , but not before workers had pumped enough water to dry_out the 40 acres of flooded Baldwin land . Baldwin has proposed building about 5 # 000 dwellings , a shopping_center and a hotel on 1 # 200 acres in the Ormond Beach area .</TEXT>
