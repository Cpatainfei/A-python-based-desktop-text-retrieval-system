   <HEADLINE> CELEBRATING DIVORCE WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER HAS A RING OF FREEDOM ; CEREMONY : ONE ENTREPRENEUR IS TURNING WEDDING BANDS INTO A CATHARTIC FASHION STATEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Do you take this divorce ? I do . With this ring I -- SMASH ! -- celebrate my freedom . With a whack of a four-pound sledgehammer and Tammy Wynette ' s &quot; D-I-V-O-R-C-E &quot; twanging in the background , Linda Howell reduced her wedding_ring to an unrecognizable mess of gold , silver and cubic zirconia . Howell swigged champagne and thought_about her plans . Make the mess into a pendant ? Earrings ? Yes , a pendant . So_much for tradition . For Howell , a 38-year-old nurse , the ceremony was a cathartic way to start over after her divorce . And it brought jeweler Lynn Peters some business . Peters is the founder of Freedom Rings : Jewelry for the Divorced , which makes custom jewelry out of wedding_rings . Women often select earrings , pendants and bracelets . Men like golf_ball markers . Peters calls the venture her &quot; artistic contribution to the recycling effort. &quot; Others call it a refreshing way to handle a painful situation . In addition to the re-formed jewelry , smashers get a signed divorce certificate and a mini-reception with champagne and music . Peters ' friends serve as ring and hammer bearers . The hammer is placed in a music_box of sorts . When opened , the faint twinkling of &quot; The Wedding March &quot; cascades out of the silk-lined container , which is quickly shut so the smashing can begin . &quot; It ' s like a release , &quot; said Howell , who split with her husband after a 14-year marriage . She said receiving the divorce papers in the mail didn ' t feel_like the real_thing . &quot; You have a ceremony when you get_married , but when you get divorced it ' s nothing. &quot; Peters felt the same way after she and her husband divorced in 1988 . &quot; I never felt_like there was closure , &quot; Peters said . &quot; So I threw a party , sort of like a wedding celebration in reverse. &quot; But what to do with the ring ? Peters said she thought_about going_to a pawn shop or giving it away , but her experience as a jeweler gave her a better idea . &quot; I thought , I ' ve never really made a custom piece of jewelry for myself , &quot; she said . &quot; So I took the diamond out , took a sledgehammer to the band and transformed it. &quot; Peters ' old band is now a pendant emblazoned with her company ' s logo -- a wedding_ring with a slash through it . She wears that on her collar , along with a button that reads , &quot; I miss my ex-husband , but my aim is improving. &quot; The Divorce Ceremony Excerpts from divorce ceremony developed by Lynn Peters : You are to be charged with the following duties : 1 . To have and to hold anyone you damn well please . 2 . To enjoy life to its fullest . 3 . To experience the pleasures you ' ve heretofore only dreamed of . 4 . To recover emotionally , financially and sexually . 5 . To regain your rightful place among the serene and satisfied . And 6 . To remember that being naked does not mean being alone . To symbolize this transition we will release any remaining ties to your past by transforming your ring -- which represents that past -- into a token of your new beginning . Now , take the hammer . Stop for a moment to consider the transformation that is about to begin your new life . Ready ? With this swing let freedom ring ! Source : Associated Press</TEXT>
