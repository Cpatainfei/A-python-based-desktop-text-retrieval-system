   <TEXT> New York Yankees outfielder DANNY TARTABULL has purchased a home_in Malibu for about $ 2.5 million , sources say . Tartabull , one of the best power hitters in baseball , is in the second year of his five-year , $ 25.5-million contract with the Yankees . He , his wife Kellie and their three children have been bi-coastal for some time , with homes_in New Jersey and Malibu . &quot; He loves Malibu and just wanted a larger house there , &quot; said co-selling agent Clive Egdes of Jon Douglas Co. ' s Studio City office . Tartabull , 31 , bought a former Malibu Showcase House , with seven bedrooms in nearly 9 # 000 square_feet . The hillside home , built a_couple_of years ago , has an ocean view from every room and an underwater view of its swimming_pool from a window in the changing room . The 2 # 700-square-foot master suite occupies the entire third level of the home , and it has two conversation areas and a marble fireplace .

She bought the Malibu home from director George Seaton in 1978 . Seaton , who died in 1979 , directed the films &quot; Miracle on 34th Street , &quot; &quot; Charley ' s Aunt &quot; and &quot; Airport. &quot; Built_in 1962 and later remodeled by Shore , the 4 # 500-square-foot house , which has an elevator and media room , has a guest wing with three bedrooms and three baths in addition to a master suite that occupies the entire second floor , except for a small artist ' s studio . The home , which has 42 feet of beachfront , has a dining_area on the ocean side of the house . Shore loved to cook and did so often on her talk_shows . Her Malibu home also has a dining_area off the kitchen that has a large round_table , built by actor George Montgomery , with a Lazy Susan in the middle . Montgomery , who was married to Shore for 18 years until they divorced in the 1960s , was at her side , with their two grown children , when she died .
