   <HEADLINE> WEEKEND ESCAPE : OJAI ; LOOSEN UP ! ; AT THIS RUSTIC HIDEAWAY , THEY SPLURGED ON PAMPERING WITHOUT SPENDING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS ON ACCOMMODATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is a great place to pretend you have more money than you ' ve got . The idea was to pamper ourselves : to spend a luscious weekend being fed , massaged , hot-tubbed and coddled for two blessed days and nights . To order from the wine list without peeking anxiously at the price ( and after seeing it , not having to explain to the waiter why we were suddenly taken with a yen for a good bottle of Snapple ) . For once to be able to say -- after endless weeks of bargain matinee movies and pasta dinners at_home -- &quot; Money is no object ! &quot; The problem was , money was an object : We needed more . And we remained stubbornly unwilling to bring our craving for self-indulgence into line with our somewhat modest budget . So we decided to compromise . We would head for Ojai and spare no expense on cuisine , massages and other trappings of the good life . We would take a side trip to Wheeler Hot Springs to try_out the hot-tub experience so highly recommended to us by recently married friends . We would visit Wheeler ' s casually elegant restaurant , and boldly order wine . And we would read the newspaper by cozy fires in the lobbies of the swankiest hotels in town . But , we would do_it all from a secret base : The Ojai Rancho Motel . In looking_for accommodations , we immediately crossed_off cozy-sounding bed and breakfast places ( which range from $ 75 to $ 100 a night ) , partly because sharing a bath was reminiscent_of college dorm days . Also , most B &amp; B ' s don ' t offer in-room fireplaces -- one romantic perk we felt we couldn ' t live without , since nights can get chilly here . And we didn ' t allow ourselves to even think_about pricey lodgings such_as Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Country_Club , which offers rooms at $ 195- $ 260 per night . We also avoided the Oaks at Ojai , a spa that offers reasonable weekend &quot; program rates &quot; of $ 125- $ 169 per person per night , which includes all meals and a range of athletic_facilities and activities . But a brochure provided by the Ojai Valley Chamber_of_Commerce discusses such goal-oriented options as 7 a.m. walks , &quot; Creative Aerobics and Aquatoning , &quot; vitamin packs and diets . For us , that was a little too reminiscent_of the workweek back in L.A. Luckily , friends steered us to the Ojai Rancho Motel -- a small , quirky establishment that sounds like it might be the motel Norman Bates managed before he got his own place . But we loved it . For $ 85 , you can get one of 16 rooms that Rancho management describes as &quot; cabin-like , &quot; which we were told have beamed ceilings and &quot; woodsy &quot; interiors . But for $ 105 , you can rent Rancho ' s only free-standing real cabin . Located at the back of the motel parking_lot , this plain , large , clean and comfortable one-room cabin features a bed that seems only slightly smaller than a football_field , as well as a view of the pool and Jacuzzi through the back windows . Because the cabin tends to be snapped_up quickly , we reserved it about three weeks in_advance . Ojai Rancho offers nothing as sophisticated as room service , a restaurant , or even a bottle_opener . The cabin does have a telephone , a TV and a small refrigerator . A motel brochure boasts a &quot; fountain ; &quot; in reality , it is more of a sprinkler . But Regal ' s Wine and Cheese Store , a mile or so down the road , can provide you with cold cuts and cheese to eat_in front of the fireplace , and they might even throw_in some free avocados from the owner ' s tree . And , during a Saturday night rainstorm , we just ordered a pizza . It ' s about an hour-and-a-half drive to Ojai , a half-rustic , half-New Age hideaway in a coastal valley below the Topa Topa Mountains , about 85 miles northwest of Los Angeles . On a Friday , it ' s best if you can hit the northbound 101 before rush_hour . With the look and feel of Northern California_wine country , Ojai seems much farther from L.A. than mere miles would suggest . Surrounded by citrus and avocado groves , as well as oak_trees , the town offers a quaint main_street with shops , taverns , cafes , and holistic book and crystal emporiums . Trolley transportation is available for 25 cents a ride . There are hiking , biking , horse and skateboarding trails . Also nearby is Lake Casitas Recreation Area in the Ojai Valley , offering fresh-water fishing and boating . And there are plenty of neighboring campgrounds . ( If you send $ 5 to the Ojai Valley Chamber_of_Commerce , P.O. Box 1134 , Ojai , Calif . 93024 , you will get_back maps and information on hotels , restaurants and recreation. ) After arriving on Friday , we took a 15-minute drive to Wheeler Hot Springs , located in a canyon six miles above Ojai at the bank of a mountain stream . We indulged in Wheeler ' s $ 72-per-couple dinner ( not including wine , tax and tip ) and hot tub package . The package is available Thursday , Friday and Saturday nights . Also available is a hot tub and champagne brunch special for $ 45 on Saturday and Sunday . Hot tubbing at $ 10 per person per half-hour and massages ranging from $ 36- $ 78 can be booked separately from Thursday through Sunday . The spa recommends making reservations for the packages a week and a half in_advance . This lovely experience includes a half-hour soak in a dark , private redwood tub room , fed by naturally hot mineral_waters . Each tub is equipped with hydrojets , and an adjoining cold tub ( really cold ) is fed by a separate spring . Then , after being cooked medium-rare , we headed across the way to an elegantly rustic dining_room with a huge fireplace to enjoy &quot; California Mediterranean &quot; cuisine which changes seasonally . We ordered ( and shared ) warm quail salad , buffalo mozzarella salad with tomatoes and artichokes , rack_of_lamb , filet_mignon and light-as-air chocolate_mousse cake and mango mousse cake . Warning : Watch it on the wine , and not because of price : After a 105-degree hot tub , a nice bottle of Merlot packs an unexpected punch . Although Wheeler Hot Springs also offers massages , we decided to save them for the next day -- after a restful afternoon of wandering the shops , including the amazing Bart ' s Books , a used-book establishment with endless stacks outdoors and indoors , plus a very friendly cat . There may be a local law that says you can ' t leave Ojai without getting a massage . The area offers all sorts . Many hotels have in-house masseurs who also welcome walk-in clients and the local paper and telephone_directory list plenty of private massage therapists . Massages are also available in combination packages with body wraps , facials , hot tubs and saunas , and even brunches and dinners . Most basic massages cost $ 40- $ 60 , but it ' s easy to run_up the bill with extras . We chose to stop by the Oaks for an &quot; aromatherapy &quot; massage , which combined the basic body kneading with a selection of scented oils such_as lemon and lavender . We called Saturday morning for an afternoon appointment . During my session , the music of choice was a tape of wolves howling , which was relaxing in a hey-I-don ' t-mind-being-lost-in-a-dark-canyon sort of way . And the massage experience was a particular thrill for my companion , who received the ultimate compliment from his masseuse : &quot; You don ' t feel_like a lawyer . You are much too loose. &quot; After a rainy Saturday we woke_up to a sunny Sunday , so we took_advantage of the fine weather to go_for a two-mile morning hike , followed by a coffee_shop breakfast . Then , we visited one of the treasures of Ojai -- 101-year-old ceramic artist Beatrice Wood , who holds court in her home and studio in Ojai ' s Happy Valley . A roadside sign invites you to drop_by . When we did so in the early afternoon , her young assistant showed us around her home -- packed with memorabilia of her worldwide travels -- as she chatted with two invited guests . We joined the conversation and the irreverent Wood -- who speaks casually of having Monet as a neighbor while studying acting in Paris -- canceled_out the compliment that had been paid my companion by his masseuse by saying cheerfully : &quot; Oh , you are a lawyer ? I ' m so sorry. &quot; While there are no set visitation hours , Wood , oft-quoted as saying her two passions are &quot; chocolate and young_men , &quot; is usually available to discuss a flamboyantly romantic life that has included love_affairs with French diplomat-turned-novelist Henri Pierre Roche and artist Marcel Duchamp . And she might even offer you a chocolate . Haithman is a Times Calendar reporter .
