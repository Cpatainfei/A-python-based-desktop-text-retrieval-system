   <TEXT> Tamasaburo Bando ' s fame comes from his creations of courtesans and spurned women on the Grand Kabuki stage , but this night he ' s wearing a double-breasted suit and standing before a sold-out audience in Yokohama . He tilts his head and seems to turn his long , lithe torso in on itself as he slips for a minute into a man ' s idea of a geisha . &quot; In a kimono , I ' m a woman . It ' s like switching languages , &quot; says the man who is arguably Japan ' s premier female impersonator , or onnagata . Without makeup and despite his suit , Tamasaburo conjures_up a demure , alluring presence , shy but hinting of the erotic . Warming_to his theme , he moves slowly across the stage , shedding one character for another . &quot; Then I had to learn to be a woman in a Western gown , &quot; he says . &quot; There ' s more freedom . It ' s easier to move. &quot; He draws his 5-foot , 8 1 / 2-inch frame upright , thrusting one shoulder back and his chin out . Now he ' s a femme_fatale ; the sultriness is more direct , the manner almost haughty . &quot; And then came the hardest part , &quot; he says as though savoring a minor irony . &quot; I had to learn how to act_as a man. &quot; Tamasaburo ( Kabuki actors are known by the first of their stage_names ) has this opportunity in &quot; Nastasya , &quot; a film by Polish director Andrzej Wajda ( &quot; Kanal , &quot; &quot; Ashes and Diamonds , &quot; &quot; Man of Iron &quot; ) . In this tale of desire and betrayed innocence , based on Dostoevsky ' s novel &quot; The Idiot , &quot; Tamasaburo acts_as both a man and a woman on film for the first time . The film opened in Tokyo in April and Tamasaburo was speaking in Yokohama as part of a national tour to promote it . For &quot; Nastasya , &quot; Wajda turned Dostoevsky ' s last chapter into a screenplay with Tamasaburo in mind to play both Prince Myshkin , a frail , innocent epileptic thought to be an idiot , and the exquisite Nastasya , a tormented , fallen woman who winds_up murdered by her lover , Rogozhin . &quot; I don ' t know of any other actor who would give me the chance to create both male and female roles at_the_same_time , &quot; Wajda says of Tamasaburo , whose acting captivated him during a visit to Japan in 1980 . Astonished to discover Tamasaburo was a man , Wajda for years nurtured the idea of working with him . And last year , in his hometown of Warsaw , Wajda filmed &quot; Nastasya &quot; over 13 days . For the film , Wajda transformed the interior of Warsaw ' s Pac Palace into the drawing room of a Czarist Russian bourgeois , the dim , candlelit setting for the drama between Rogozhin , played by Toshiyuki Nagashima , and Prince Myshkin . The film has a dark , claustrophobic , mysterious quality to it . The fact that it is a Russian story performed in Japanese with Japanese actors adds_to its mysteriousness . The ambiguity of motivations and desires is at the heart of &quot; Nastasya , &quot; and the story is told through dialogue and flashbacks over the course of the night Rogozhin kills Nastasya . Tamasaburo ' s almost dreamy switching from the role of Myshkin to the Role of Nastasya , which he does simply by donning a lace shawl and earrings , make ambiguity the substance of the film as well . * For more_than 20 years , Tamasaburo ' s celebrity has been a sort of Japanese version of the 1950s Hollywood studio stars . He evokes a similar glamour and star quality , yet his career has been molded as a virtuoso in sexual ambivalence . This ambivalence , his almost childlike androgyny , is one ' s first impression on meeting Tamasaburo . His hair is boyishly cut , Hans Brinker style , and while he ' s 44 now , he still has the looks that made him a matinee_idol in his 20s among young Japanese women . His manager calls him &quot; young master &quot; as we are introduced for our first meeting in a Tokyo hotel suite , and in this and a subsequent meeting , Tamasaburo shifts between presenting himself as an adventurous actor in search of challenges and as a prima_donna of the Kabuki world . He is reserved , almost courtly , one minute , and disarmingly funny about himself the next . We sip Japanese tea and speak through an interpreter . He tells me that acting in &quot; Nastasya &quot; was the biggest risk he has ever taken , and taking it has given him an extraordinary sense of freedom in the complicated tangle of his personal and professional_life . &quot; I used to be bothered by the confusion . My life has been as an onnagata . But am I a woman ? No . Am I a man ? Not really , &quot; he says . But after playing Prince Myshkin , he says , something clicked . &quot; It fit and I thought to myself , ' Ah , I can act_as a man too. ' Now I take things easier : man or woman , it doesn ' t matter . I am an actor and as long as I can work , that ' s what matters. &quot; Perhaps the most remarkable part of Tamasaburo ' s career is that he is one of the few Kabuki stars who has ventured out of the cloistered , hierarchical world of Kabuki . Curiosity spurred him at first , but there was also the urge to escape and a yearning to prove he had talent in addition to his famed beauty . He pantomimes pulling , like rabbits , the various roles he has performed out of a hat : standards from the Kabuki repertoire , Lady Macbeth and Desdemona from Shakespeare , Medea , modern Japanese Shimpa plays . One side of Tamasaburo ' s artistic life remains ensconced in formal , tradition-bound Kabuki , and the other is a roving , continuous experiment . Outside of Kabuki , it ' s as if he ' s rummaging through the world ' s cultural closet , constantly trying various women ' s roles from different centuries and countries to see how they fit . &quot; I ' m a Pierrot , &quot; he says , &quot; living_in an unfinished dream. &quot; Tamasaburo has mostly played_out his dreams on stages in Japan . While he has toured with the Grand Kabuki in the United States , including a stop in Los Angeles in 1985 , he rarely has taken any of his non-Kabuki work abroad . &quot; There is no risk in Japan . But I used to be afraid of being taken as a joke outside , &quot; he says . No longer . He and Wajda hope to bring &quot; Nastasya &quot; to the United States and Europe later this year . Going abroad , finding an international audience is Tamasaburo ' s next adventure . &quot; Now I feel free . I used to think no one in the West would understand me , an onnagata . So strange . So exotic . But the truth is that onnagata is the essence of acting. &quot; * Nothing could be further from the conceit of an international stage than Tokyo ' s Kabuki-za , a fanciful version of traditional Japanese architecture standing smack in the middle of the Ginza , one of Tokyo ' s swankiest shopping and entertainment districts . This is the home of the Grand Kabuki , the place where Tamasaburo came_of_age and an imposing symbol of the sealed-off world of Kabuki . One is either born into it , or , like Tamasaburo , you are chosen to be adopted into it . Tamasaburo was born in 1950 as Sinichi Nirehara . He was the sickly seventh son of a Tokyo teahouse proprietress and her ne ' er-do-well , playboy husband . A bout of polio had left him unable to walk until he was 3 and then on spindly , fragile legs . But at the age of 4 , Tamasaburo discovered dancing , first as a form of therapy , and then as an obsession . By the time he was 6 , his dancing teacher was about to marry an important but fading Kabuki star , Kanya Morita , and Tamasaburo was an implicit part of the marriage for the childless Kanya , who was looking_for an heir . Tamasaburo ' s immersion in the 400-year-old traditions of Kabuki began . The story has it that Kabuki ' s founder was Okuni , a renegade priestess who ran_off to Kyoto in the 1580s with an actor . Okuni began performing in a dry riverbed , devising a kind of vaudeville street entertainment . Kabuki ' s beginnings were bawdy with dancing geisha performing as a prelude to prostitution . By 1629 , the governmental authorities had banned women from performing , and Kabuki was_well on its way from low art to the ritualized high art of today . It has often been said that without the banning of actresses , Kabuki would have no reason to exist , for the onnagata , the highest art_form of theatrical transvestism in the world , would never have been invented . In his dressing room one recent afternoon , Tamasaburo talked_about his childhood and training to be an onnagata as though it were an inevitability . &quot; All I wanted was to dance and be_on stage . I never thought_about choosing ; I just was , &quot; he says , lounging in Indian muslin drawstring pants and a golden yellow silk jacket before he prepared to go_on stage . As a child , day after day , year after year , he came_to Kabuki-za , undergoing a strict regimen of study , including the Japanese string instrument called the shamisen , dancing , singing , acting , even the tea ceremony and , most crucially , the ways of onnagata . The greatest of onnagata have claimed that the artful rendering of women on stage comes from existing as a woman off it . One of the great 17th-Century masters , Ayame Yoshizawa , wrote : &quot; An onnagata should act like an onnagata even in the dressing room . . . . An actor who fails to live even his daily life like a woman will probably never be judged a successful onnagata . &quot; Many have adhered to this advice , giving_rise to the stories of actors wearing women ' s clothes at_home or going_to the women ' s section of public baths . The code and craft of onnagata is the creation of an abstraction , a man ' s idea of woman , but a stylized version rather than a specific woman . Because the actor is a man , he can create a stylized woman , and from distance and sexual tension spring the art . This is the tradition Tamasaburo joined and in which he excelled . In his teens , despite his questionable Kabuki pedigree , he landed major roles and attracted enormous attention . When he was 20 , one of Japan ' s famous modern novelists , the late Yukio Mishima , doted on Tamasaburo and wrote_of him : &quot; The fascination of this beautiful young_man is of another era than our own . But it may carry with it a magical_power , which by the right and privilege of his young age , will succeed in completely overturning the prevailing tastes of our time. &quot; Tamasaburo as Kabuki super-star has been credited with kicking_off a Kabuki revival by bringing_in a new generation of fans . He obliged his fans ' taste for spectacle , driving_around Tokyo in a big Cadillac and posing for pinup posters . While Tamasaburo left his feminine roles on the stage , there was a blending of the persona and the person . Kabuki leaves no room for improvisation , yet somehow Tamasaburo managed to bring a modern sensibility to his roles . &quot; It was all those movies I watched , &quot; he says , telling of how he ' d rush_out most days between the matinee and evening performances at Kabuki-za to one of the nearby Ginza movie_houses . His favorites were the glamour queens -- Greta Garbo , Vivien Leigh , Rita Hayworth -- but he watched everything from Hollywood to Fellini to Bergman . &quot; I would replace the actors with myself and I studied how to act like them. &quot; * Until he was 24 , Tamasaburo never acted in non-Kabuki roles because his adoptive father forbade it . But when Kanya died in 1974 , Tamasaburo jumped at the opportunity . He tried his hand at Shakespeare and even took_on the role once played by his heroine , Greta Garbo , in the movie version of Dumas ' &quot; La Dame aux Camelias. &quot; Partly this was a savvy career move since high visibility was a way of ensuring that he would continue to get good Kabuki roles from the rigid Kabuki hierarchy once Kanya was no longer there as his protector . But Tamasaburo ' s ventures outside of Kabuki also suited his artistic temperament . He was chastised by many of the Kabuki elders for tainting Kabuki traditions by taking_on modern , Western roles . He did_it anyway , and by dint of his vast popularity , he was always able to return to the Kabuki stage . &quot; It was very hard , finding the right balance , &quot; he says now of those years . &quot; I just believed that I could go_back and forth , and not spoil the onnagata form when I came_back to the Kabuki world. &quot; In 1982 , Tamasaburo performed outside Japan for the first time , traveling with the Grand Kabuki . He made his U.S. debut at the Metropolitan Opera_House in New York and returned to the United States in 1984 and 1985 . In 1985 , at UCLA ' s Royce Hall , he appeared in the Kabuki classic &quot; Kasane , &quot; playing a spurned woman who becomes possessed by her raging desire for revenge . Times dance writer Lewis Segal called his performance &quot; unforgettable : tortured and terrifying. &quot; Tamasaburo calls the U.S. tours a kind of turning point in his career . He was showered with attention , sought after by the_likes_of Andy Warhol . He also remembers , though , how strange onnagata seemed to Americans . &quot; One interviewer asked me if my parents were sad when I told them I was going_to be an onnagata . I didn ' t know what to say . But it was a natural question. &quot; Over the past decade , Tamasaburo has moved more and more away from Kabuki . He says it remains his artistic anchor and he still performs every year at Kabuki-za . This year , for instance , he ' s only appearing there for two months out of the year . There are many reasons : He ' s growing older , the pace of three performances a day is too demanding , and as he puts it , &quot; The world outside of Kabuki is more interesting to me now. &quot; He has directed films and plays , done a film series performing traditional dances and regularly takes_up offers to collaborate with visiting directors or choreographers . Occasionally , critics or other artists say that Tamasaburo has become a dilettante , picking_up projects like so many hobbies . His work is dazzling to look_at , they say , but too_much the vision of an interior_decorator and not enough of an artist with something new_to say . But there is always an audience , and Tamasaburo says there is something driving him : finding the link between the onnagata tradition and other forms of theater . Tamasaburo ' s method is usually to wait for someone else to make the link . Often , when musicians or filmmakers or artists of one sort or another visit Tokyo , meeting Tamasaburo is_on their list of things to do . &quot; Sometimes I feel_like a tourist ' s monument , &quot; he says , explaining how visitors from abroad love to come_to his dressing_room and watch him be transformed under the layers of rich brocade , the billowy butterfly bow sash , the elaborately sculpted high wig and the heavy white makeup . But sometimes these encounters spark an idea . He met cellist Yo-Yo Ma this way , and wound_up performing a dance to Ma ' s musical accompaniment . Pianist Emanuel Ax , too , was taken with the idea of collaborating with Tamasaburo . This month in Tokyo , Tamasaburo is performing a dance he arranged with Belgian choreographer Maurice Bejart , and next year he will play Queen Elizabeth I in a revival of Spanish writer Francisco Ors ' &quot; Contradanza-Contradanza-Contradanza &quot; directed by Nuria Espert . * Some might be tempted to think that all this is the height of camp : playful and knowing productions based on Tamasaburo ' s sexual role-playing . But that is not at all how he is seen in Japan . The idea of caricature does not enter into the onnagata ' s role in Kabuki plays or Tamasaburo ' s non-Kabuki roles . There is nothing reminiscent_of Barry Humphries as Dame Edna nor the comedy of Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie and Robin Williams as Mrs . Doubtfire . Instead , Tamasaburo ' s appeal seems to rest more on the stylized illusion he creates . Quite a_few theories have been devised on why the theme of sexual ambivalence is so popular in Japan , and not just in Kabuki . Comic_books for young_girls are filled with stories featuring androgynous , beautiful young princes or samurai . One of the most popular theater groups among young_girls is the all-female Takarazuka Theater . One reason often given is that in Japan -- like most places , but even more so -- part of growing_up is learning to play the role of one ' s sex . Hence , from pop culture to high art , the appeal of sexual ambivalence is that it offers an escape . When Wajda came_up with the idea for &quot; Nastasya , &quot; the allure of Tamasaburo was not the promise of escapism but the power of his stylized acting . Wajda wrote_of Tamasaburo ' s &quot; creative stylized beauty &quot; after seeing him perform for the first time . Wajda likened the effect to the shock Europeans felt when they first saw Japanese artist Utamaro ' s wood_block prints , done_in the late 18th Century , of geisha and Japan ' s floating world of the pleasure quarters . Wajda wanted that shock , the tension between the creative and the stylized , for &quot; Nastasya. &quot; At first , Tamasaburo was wary of Wajda and his project . &quot; I was scared of the material , I was scared of the whole idea of switching from man to woman , &quot; he says , pretending for a minute that he is_on the set_in Warsaw so he can explain how he and Wajda worked together . He perches himself daintily on the edge of the couch and mimics drawing around his shoulders the flowing lace shawl that in the film represents the character of Nastasya . Her character came easily , he says . The imaginary shawl falls_away and Tamasaburo takes the part of Prince Myshkin . &quot; Wajda would be right here , &quot; he says as though it ' s a rehearsal and the director is hovering by his side . &quot; He ' d just tell me details and details . How to move my hands , how to sit , how to talk , how to find the innocent and lonely part of me that is just like Prince Myshkin. &quot; Tamasaburo is a perfectionist , almost dictatorial about controlling every detail around him ; &quot; Nastasya &quot; is a study of controlled acting . This desire for control is one of the main reasons Tamasaburo has been drawn increasingly to film and away from the Kabuki stage . &quot; Ever since I was young , I wanted to create my own world . that ' s what I am doing now by making films , &quot; he says . With film , unlike the stage , Tamasaburo feels he has been able to capture the exact performance he wants to capture . In his dance films , he has set_out to preserve his version of his onnagata talent in static , unchanging documents . And with &quot; Nastasya , &quot; his most unusual venture outside of Kabuki has been preserved as well . Tamasaburo says &quot; Nastasya &quot; allowed him to create a world of_his_own making . By working with Wajda , he was able to draw_on the onnagata tradition and create something new . He no longer believes that being an onnagata is , as the 17th-Century master Ayame Yoshizawa said , a way_of_life . He no longer cares that many in the Kabuki world think this is heretical . There is no great_divide , he says , between creating the illusion of a Kabuki courtesan or a character out of Dostoevsky . &quot; Maybe Wajda saw something universal in the way I act . If I didn ' t believe this , I could never do what I do . I could never have acted in ' Nastasya. ' &quot; This is the key to Tamasaburo ' s work : his claim that his acting tradition , so utterly vernacular and tied to Japan , can be transformed into something universal . He has staked out his territory as if he has become a product of his imagination or , as he puts it , a minstrel living_out his dreams . In Japan , Tamasaburo ' s territory is an established one ; he is about to find_out whether it travels across borders .</TEXT>
