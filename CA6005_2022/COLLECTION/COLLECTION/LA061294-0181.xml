   <HEADLINE> STATE TAKING WRONG ROAD IN DRIVE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES ; POLLUTION STILL WILL BE EMITTED BY POWER_PLANTS . HYDROGEN IS THE WAY TO GO , AND THE VALLEY CAN BE A KEY PLAYER IN THE TECHNOLOGY ' S DEVELOPMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Don ' t look now , but there is a ZEV in your future . Or maybe a LEV or a ULEV . No , we ' re not talking_about a mustachioed politician , his twin brother and a distant cousin . The ZEV , LEV and ULEV affecting all San Fernando Valley residents by 1998 are zero , low and ultra-low emission vehicles . The California Air Resources Board is weighing options presented by auto_makers to meet toughening air quality standards . Electric vehicles firmly occupy the inside_track in this race for big dollars , since the ARB recognizes these as zero-emission vehicles , totally pollution-free . In May , the board upheld a requirement that the auto industry sell electric_cars in California by 1998 . Not to quibble , but this doesn ' t make_sense . The air following an electric vehicle may smell as sweet as a newly bathed baby , but somewhere someone else is suffering with air that makes a diaper pail ' s aura pleasant by comparison . You see , those happy little electrons that are just dying to propel your 1999 Electrivette down Interstate 405 need a little convincing before they are ready to serve you . True , billions of them are available in the wire hooked_up to recharge your waiting E ' vette , but they need a push before loading_up its tired-out battery . Pushers in our society suffer from bad press . These electric pushers , or power generating plants , are no exception . * Coal-fired plants generate about half of the U.S. electric_power . Even with expensive pollution-control devices , the sulfur in the coal returns to earth as acid_rain , devastating plants and wildlife . Moreover , coal combustion generates vast quantities of that greenhouse ogre -- carbon_dioxide . Petroleum and natural-gas power_plants produce another 20 % of our electricity . These natural_resources are limited , and imported petroleum contributes to our balance of payments problems . And the carbon_dioxide produced by combustion adds_to global warming . Nuclear power contributes about 15 % to satisfying our electrical appetite . Talk_about bad press . To point_out the problems with this power source would be to flog a mortally wounded horse . Rounding_out the possible methods of recharging an electrically mobile society , 10 % of our power is generated hydroelectrically . The rest comes from a handful of environmentally benign technologies including geothermal , wind , solar thermal and solar photovoltaic . Electric_cars masquerading as socially responsible ZEVs , LEVs and ULEVs ? No way . But envision our society propelled happily down the freeway of life without asphyxiation , with no melting of polar icecaps , preserving the rainbow_trout and , at_the_same_time , thumbing our collective noses at the petty tyrants who always seem to control the world ' s oil supply . Pipe_dream ? Think again . Remember how in the ' 60s Dustin Hoffman was urged to ponder the word plastics ? For ' 90s graduates , the word is hydrogen . Burn hydrogen in an auto engine , as Mazda ' s road_tests are now demonstrating , and all you get are water and a trace of nitrogen_oxides , a tiny fraction of the nitrogen_oxides now created by gasoline-burning engines . Take it a technological step further and combine hydrogen with oxygen from air in a device called a fuel_cell and you generate enough electric_power on board to propel a bus . Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot_Project demonstration buses will travel the streets soon . It sounds too good to be true : renewable energy based on the most abundant element in the universe . The combustion product falls_back to earth as life-giving rain . What ' s the catch ? The catch , my friends , is money . Overcoming technical problems is expensive . One challenge is developing a safe gas_tank . Developing hydrogen into a viable , large-scale energy resource will take big bucks . This explains why the Japanese have established the World Energy Network , a hydrogen-development plan with a reported budget of more_than $ 2 billion . * And where do we stand ? The Department_of_Energy , which is responsible_for maintaining U.S. preeminence in energy , submitted a 1995 request for $ 5.5 million for hydrogen research , down from the 1994 budget of $ 10 million . Have we given_up on trying to compete in this emerging global technology even before it gets_off_the_ground ? Are future Miatas going_to drain our dollars not only when they ' re bought but throughout their 10- to 15-year lifetimes ? Our Valley is a key battleground in this ZEV shootout . From Calstart , the nonprofit Burbank-based company chartered to develop advanced transportation technology , to the federal Energy Technology Engineering Center in the mountains above Chatsworth , the Valley stands to gain economically from development of hydrogen for transportation . Valley-bred aerospace technologies in hydrogen , photovoltaics and fuel_cells position us at the center of this transportation revolution . If we invest in hydrogen development , the Hydrogen Valley teamed with Silicon_Valley will reign as California ' s technology crown_jewels in the 21st Century .</TEXT>
