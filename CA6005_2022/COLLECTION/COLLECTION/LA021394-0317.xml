   <HEADLINE> BUSINESSES CASH IN ON TRADITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Chinese New Year , N.B.C. Seafood Restaurant in Monterey Park serves dinner combinations with names like &quot; good business , &quot; &quot; good_fortune &quot; and &quot; money come in. &quot; Hong Kong Supermarket stocks up_on oranges , whose name in Mandarin sounds like the word for wealth , and dumplings , whose boatlike shape resembles Chinese gold bullion . These items -- meant to attract prosperity in the coming year -- have more_than symbolic significance for the establishments that sell them . The New Year ' s celebration is a windfall for Chinese businesses much as Christmas is to department_stores and malls . Elaborate holiday feasts boost sales for markets and restaurants . Phone_lines are jammed and flights to Asia booked as celebrants reunite with family and friends . And Asian bankers profit from increased transactions , as people withdraw money to meet expenses , settle old debts or embark_on new investments . Dangling brilliantly near the entrance of the Hong Kong Supermarket are red scrolls and firecrackers , a paper dragon and gold-colored coin_banks . Displays of holiday nuts and mushrooms are heaped in front of the aisles . &quot; On that traditional New Year ' s eve dinner , you have to prepare a lot of food , &quot; store manager Philip Pan said . &quot; More_than enough for everybody. &quot; Sales pick_up rapidly in the weeks before the holiday , he said , and more_than double on New Year ' s eve . Celebrations are often held at restaurants . N.B.C. Seafood manager William Lee said business picks_up by about 50 % in the two weeks before New Year ' s when companies hold banquets , and in the weeks afterward , when families gather for feasts . A red Buddhist shrine with offerings of oranges and incense to the gods of property and business marks the entrance of Chinese American Live Poultry in Rosemead . Here , customers choose from a variety of fowl -- pheasants , squab , ducks , geese and , most importantly , chicken . The back_room is stacked to the ceiling with cages of birds that are butchered fresh and sold with the heads and feet still attached . Sales leap to three times the normal rate in the days around the holiday , and customers sometimes wait more_than an hour in_lines that stretch down the block , owner Quan Phu said . And while fresh chicken is an important New Year ' s dish for any Chinese family , it ' s especially crucial to Buddhists , who sacrifice it to their ancestors on that day , he added . &quot; They don ' t want chicken without wings or head or feet , &quot; he explained . &quot; They want a whole chicken , a perfect one. &quot; The holiday is an opportunity for celebrants to visit with family and friends they may_not have seen all year , and many take that opportunity to travel home to Asia . Helen Koo , owner of America Asia Travel Center in Monterey Park , said flights to Hong Kong , Taiwan and Mainland China increase about 45 % or more over the holidays . Sales have jumped from 600 in December to 1 # 000 this month , she said . Travelers from the opposite direction boost local real_estate firms , said James Chou , vice_president of George Realty Group in Alhambra . &quot; In Taiwan , China , everybody has a vacation , so a lot of people plan to travel , maybe a month , looking_for some property , &quot; he explained . In the eight years that George Realty has operated , Chou said , the company has seen sales increase 15 % to 30 % in the weeks around New Year ' s , as Asian investors seek business_deals and recent immigrants purchase homes . And those who can ' t make_it across the Pacific can always phone home . Sprint spokeswoman Juanada Teas said calls to Asia increase 20 % to 30 % over normal levels during the period from New Year ' s Day through the following weekend . AT &amp; T has no similar statistics available , spokeswoman Lorraine Wong said , but the company ' s Chinese-speaking operators are working six-day weeks to meet the increased demand . New Year ' s customs can be a mixed blessing for business , said John Hou , president of the Asian Pacific Bancorp . and member of the Monterey Park planning_commission . Because arguments are forbidden during the 15-day holiday , he explained , bankers and other businessmen scramble to collect outstanding debts before New Year ' s Day . In general , bankers come_out ahead , though , said Philip Ma , manager of Cathay Bank ' s main branch in Chinatown . &quot; You see a lot of transactions going_on because people see it as a time of prosperity , to celebrate what you ' ve accomplished in the past year , &quot; he said . &quot; You see more activity among people who like to invest. &quot; This year -- the year of the dog -- bodes well for business , he added . &quot; The dog ' s nature is very loyal , &quot; he said . &quot; So it should be a conservative , growing year , ( although ) I would n ' t expect a big jump. &quot;</TEXT>
