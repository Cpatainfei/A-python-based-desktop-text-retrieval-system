   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : TEACHERS SELECTED FOR CHEMISTRY WORKSHOP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four San Fernando Valley high_school teachers are among 20 educators from nine states selected to participate this week in an Occidental College workshop on teaching the daily life applications of chemistry . The workshop , sponsored by the American Chemical Society , helps science_teachers develop an instructional plan for high_school students who will probably not study science in college.The course material and the laboratory activities emphasize how chemistry can play a part in the experiences of the average person . For example , the teachers may have students take_water samples from their house and test it for lead . Instructors also may talk_about the health hazards of pesticides that can show_up in food . &quot; In the newspaper , we are reading about toxic_waste , environmental hazards , ozone_layers , pollution of the bay , &quot; said Frances B . Hill , media director of Occidental College . &quot; ( The program ) empowers the teacher to pass_on base knowledge to students and hopefully interest them in keeping current with issues. &quot; Teachers who received fellowships to attend the workshop include Kate Smirnoff and Richard Buck , Louisville High_School , Woodland Hills ; Sandra Rallis Comouche , Notre Dame High_School , Sherman Oaks , and Emily Smith of Burroughs High_School in Burbank .
