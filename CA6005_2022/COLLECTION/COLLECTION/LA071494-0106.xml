   <HEADLINE> LOCATION FOR GARDENA RETAIL PROJECT ASSAILED ; BUSINESS : THE NORTH END OF TOWN HAS FAR MORE NEED OF THE SHOPPING AREA , ACTIVISTS SAY . CITY OFFICIALS POINT TO LOWER LAND COSTS THAT ENCOURAGE BUILDING IN THE SOUTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Philip Johnson has lived_on the north end of Gardena for 25 years and can recall the store he would run to as a child on errands for his mother . The store was a Ralph ' s supermarket on Rosecrans and Van Ness avenues , but it closed about 10 years ago , Johnson said . An Alpha Beta was once on Rosecrans too . It shut earlier this year and still stands boarded_up . Today , one shopping_center -- Supreme Market on Western Avenue -- lies within Gardena ' s boundaries north of Rosecrans , where African American and Latino residents make_up 90 % of some neighborhoods . According to census data , the shopping_center serves a population of about 15 # 000 . By contrast , in southern Gardena , the ratio is one market for every 2 # 300 residents , most of whom are white or Asian . Now , a newly formed group of activists is criticizing city officials as they move to bring another major chain to the south end , at Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue . The city recently bought a vacant 10-acre site from Caltrans for $ 3.74 million . It plans to sell it for the same price to De Anza Properties of Sunnyvale , which will build a 64 # 000-square-foot Smith ' s Food and Drug Center . The development could bring the city as much as $ 500 # 000 a year in sales tax , City_Manager Kenneth W . Landau said . And , Landau added : &quot; If we hadn ' t bought_it , it would have gone_to a private developer and we ' d have no control over what development would be there. &quot; But opponents , who call themselves the South Bay Open Space and Youth Recreation Committee , argue that the plan is an example of the economic &quot; redlining &quot; that , they say , appears to have gone_on in Gardena for many years . Committee_member Frank O ' Brien said the area south of Redondo Beach Boulevard is particularly concentrated with market development -- 10 markets , or one for every 1 # 750 residents . &quot; We question the decision of the city to actively assist a private developer locate a new store in an area already well-served by markets when the north_side entirely lacks these facilities , &quot; O ' Brien said . He has notified the local chapter of the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People about his group ' s discrimination concerns . The apparent disparity in the number of markets on the two sides of town is not intentional , Landau said , but he agreed that the city ' s development plans are based on economics . As city officials have aggressively encouraged development during the past nine years , they have often offered incentives such_as sales tax rebates , he said . As a result , enough business has been attracted to recoup losses experienced in the 1980s , when four of the city ' s six card clubs -- then a major source of revenue for Gardena -- closed . &quot; Now we ' re one of the most financially secure cities because of the private / public partnership we ' ve sought , &quot; Landau said . He said city officials are working to revitalize northern Gardena , but they have found more willingness to invest in the south , where land is cheaper and less industrial . &quot; We ' ve talked_of trying to relocate other businesses from other cities , &quot; Landau said . &quot; I personally have spent a lot more time trying to attract development in the area north of Rosecrans rather than in the south , but the price of land is so high in ( the city ' s north ) that it ' s not feasible for developers to come in. &quot; However , opponents say the city is not doing enough to ensure that all citizens are represented with equal services . So far , they point_out , no public hearing on the Smith ' s development has been held , and O ' Brien said repeated requests to meet with individual council_members to discuss alternative sites have been refused . Also , they say , a state-required Environmental Impact Report has not been done , even as grading has begun at the site on Artesia and Vermont . Landau said the work is soil remediation . He added that public hearings on the report and the site plan will be held_in about 90 days . &quot; Our intention is to do everything possible to have the Smith ' s food center at that site , &quot; he said . When O ' Brien ' s committee first objected to the new development , it was worried about harm to an adjacent natural area of rare willow wetland that is used by migratory birds . But the committee ' s concerns go beyond the environment , O ' Brien said . &quot; We ' re not using the issue of economic redlining as a means to achieve our environmental goal ; we want to improve the city generally . We want to preserve open space and also make_sure all parts of the community have access to all_the services they need , &quot; he said . O ' Brien said the committee has been meeting with business and community leaders on the issue . Johnson , the 25-year resident of the city , ran a mayoral campaign in the April city election criticizing the city for neglecting the north and doing business behind closed doors . He said he can understand the city ' s business rationale . But he said he would like a development such_as Smith ' s in the north because there are high-income earners in some neighborhoods who can support it . That they don ' t have it , he says , is an indication that something more_than economics might be at_work . &quot; It ' s something I ' ve been trying to avoid for a long_time , the racist picture , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; But that ' s what it looks like. &quot;</TEXT>
