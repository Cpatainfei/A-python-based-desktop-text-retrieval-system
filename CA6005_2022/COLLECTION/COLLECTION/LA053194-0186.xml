   <HEADLINE> MUHAMMAD ATTACK SUSPECT HEAVILY ARMED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A former Nation of Islam minister who clashed with fellow Muslims had a small arsenal , including a hunting rifle with a scope , when he allegedly shot black nationalist Khallid Abdul Muhammad and five other men outside a university auditorium , authorities said Monday . The suspect , identified as James Edward Bess , 49 , opened_fire just after Muhammad finished a speech on the University of California campus here Sunday night . Muhammad -- a former Nation of Islam spokesman known for his fiery anti-Jewish , anti-white rhetoric -- was shot in the legs . He and a bodyguard were reported in stable condition . Four other bodyguards were treated and released . Law_enforcement authorities said they have not ruled_out a conspiracy in the shooting but they believe Bess , a Tacoma resident who was booked on several counts of attempted murder , was acting alone . Investigators have not offered a motive . People familiar_with the suspect described Bess as a devotee of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and a contentious figure who was removed from his post as a leader of the Seattle-area mosque . He once wrote an open_letter in a black community newspaper criticizing the mayor of Seattle for denouncing remarks by Farrakhan . On another occasion , he told viewers of a public access television_station in Seattle that violence was the way to deal with black leaders who let_down the black community . &quot; If this false leadership continues I won ' t be surprised to see the same thing as happened in South_Africa , where the black_woman was hacked to death with an ax and . . . thrown on a fire and burned_up , &quot; Bess said on a 1985 tape aired by ABC and CBS . &quot; Matter_of_fact , I think that ' s what needs to take_place with this leadership . They ought to be doused with gasoline and burned in public. &quot; A former top aide to Farrakhan , Muhammad had been one of Farrakhan ' s most vituperative lieutenants until a verbal assault on Jews , Arabs and whites provoked denunciations by the Rev . Jesse Jackson , black members of Congress and President Clinton , leading to Muhammad ' s suspension . Despite the suspension , Muhammad has remained so publicly loyal to Farrakhan that many wonder if he continues to speak_for Farrakhan . He says only that they remain in contact but adds , &quot; We don ' t have the closeness that we had . We don ' t have the communication that we used to. &quot; Muhammad had come_to Riverside to make the second of two speeches in the Los Angeles area over the weekend . The shooting Sunday night occurred despite tight security inside the UC Riverside auditorium during his two-hour speech . The 500 members of the audience were searched as they entered the room . In addition to two city police_officers , about 50 members of the Fruit of Islam -- the security arm of the Nation of Islam -- were present . Muhammad drew cheers during his speech when he described whites as satanic and Jews as oppressors . In a speech Saturday in Los Angeles , Muhammad referred to Jews as &quot; bagel-eating &quot; and &quot; hook-nosed &quot; and contended that &quot; the black holocaust is 100 times worse than any other holocaust. &quot; Police and university spokesmen said that security personnel were caught by surprise when Muhammad left the podium and said he would continue to field questions outside . Muhammad said he was going outdoors because he had been told -- apparently in error -- that the sponsoring organization had to vacate the gymnasium or pay additional costs . &quot; There were no other events scheduled ( later that day in the gymnasium ) , &quot; said UC Riverside spokesman Jack Chappell . &quot; There was no reason they couldn ' t have stayed longer . There was no compelling reason for them to have left . There was no time limit. &quot; University officials acknowledged that they were apprehensive about Muhammad ' s speech on campus , sponsored by the African Student Alliance , but said that to have blocked the talk would have been a denial of free speech . When he came outside , Muhammad , 43 , was hit in both legs by shots fired from a 9-millimeter handgun . A bodyguard , Varnardo Puckett , 34 , of Pomona , remains hospitalized with three wounds . Caliph Sadiq , 33 , of Upland was shot in the upper right back . Terrell D . Strait , 20 , of Pomona was shot in the left shoulder and stomach . Steve L . Washington received a minor gunshot injury , and Thomas L . Harri was grazed on the back by a gunshot . By Monday afternoon , Muhammad had gotten_out of his hospital_bed and was walking_around his room , according to Nation of Islam security_guards who declined to identify themselves . &quot; He is fine . His spirits are fine , &quot; said a woman who identified herself as Muhammad ' s sister at Riverside Community Hospital on Monday afternoon . &quot; He ' s just tired . Doing his father ' s work makes him tired , &quot; said the woman , who would not give her name but was sitting in a room beside Muhammad ' s 9-year-old son , Farrakhan , in the hospital ' s intensive care wing . One visitor said Khallid Muhammad was grateful for the bodyguards who took bullets for him : &quot; He said , ' If it wasn ' t for ( them ) I would n ' t be here. ' &quot; While Fruit of Islam members guarded his hospital_room , Muhammad received a steady stream of visitors , including his son and other family members . He also reportedly talked to Louis Farrakhan on the telephone . As of late Monday , the Nation of Islam had released no statement regarding the shooting . Bess was severely beaten by a crowd of people who witnessed the shooting . Authorities said he suffered a fractured shoulder , multiple abrasions and some lost teeth . He remained hospitalized . Riverside police reported Monday that they confiscated not only the handgun allegedly used in the shooting , but also found a backpack containing two other guns and a hunting rifle in Bess ' car , which was parked nearby . Bess , sources said , had been involved in internal disputes with Nation of Islam officials , including one who was a close friend of Muhammad and was near the scene of the shooting . One knowledgeable source told The Times that Bess was removed about three years ago from his post as minister of a mosque in Seattle by a former Nation of Islam minister and official , Wazir Muhammad . Bess &quot; apparently had serious personality conflicts with many of the members of this particular mosque , &quot; said the source . &quot; There were many complaints from within the mosque. &quot; At the time Bess was suspended , Wazir Muhammad was Western regional representative for the Nation of Islam , responsible_for the area west of the Mississippi_River . A resident of Los Angeles , Wazir Muhammad was said to be with Khallid Muhammad during the speech but not at his side when the shooting took_place . &quot; Everybody knows that Wazir and Khallid are the best of friends , &quot; the source said . Wazir Muhammad succeeded Khallid Muhammad as minister of Mosque 27 in Los Angeles and is now West Coast bureau chief of the Final Call , the Nation of Islam ' s newspaper . Khallid Muhammad , in his role as a traveling national spokesman , was acquainted with Bess , the source said . But contributing to the mystery surrounding the shooting are indications that Bess may have shared many of the views of the man he allegedly shot . An open_letter to Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle published in a local paper four years ago and signed by a James E . Bess , criticized the city ' s black mayor for denouncing Nation of Islam leader Farrakhan after a speech by Farrakhan in Seattle . &quot; Mr. Mayor , &quot; the letter stated , &quot; never again let Jews twist your arm to denounce a good man -- Minister Louis Farrakhan. &quot; The alleged gunman is himself a shooting victim and has appeared frequently on public-access television as a preacher of_his_own variant of Islam , according to an Associated Press account . On Nov . 19 , 1988 , it was reported , Bess was hit by two bullets in a gang shootout as he was making a call_in a telephone_booth outside a convenience_store in the crime-plagued High Point neighborhood of Seattle . Bess has no arrest record in his hometown , said Police Sgt . Ed Striedinger , a homicide detective at the time of the episode . The father of eight , Bess also is known as Abdul Haqq Mohammad and goes_by Brother James X and Brother James X Bess on his TV_shows that , according to one viewer , have both promoted and departed from Farrakhan ' s points_of_view . One Seattle resident , Syid Suni Askia , a self-described mainstream Muslim and not a follower of Farrakhan , was familiar_with Bess and his television_show . &quot; For whatever reasons , ( Bess ) and the main body ( of the Nation of Islam ) had a falling_out , &quot; said Askia . &quot; So he had a self-styled ministry , speaking_for himself . But he still saw himself as a loyal supporter of Farrakhan. &quot; His broadcasts , aired two days a week , have been advertised in the Facts , a weekly black community newspaper , under the heading &quot; Hear and See , Min . Farrakhan , a Living Witness of ' Jesus. ' &quot; Topics for the shows have included &quot; Farrakhan : The Special Spokesman , &quot; &quot; Farrakhan : The Torchlight for America , &quot; &quot; Farrakhan : ' God ' s Man on the Straight Path ' &quot; and &quot; Farrakhan Speaks. &quot; Bess once headed the local branch of the Nation of Islam but split from the organization of Louis Farrakhan a_few years ago , Askia said . &quot; It ' s public_knowledge that he was at_odds with the people &quot; running the Nation of Islam , Askia said . Rabbi Marvin Hier , dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , said Monday that by shooting Muhammad , his enemies make him a martyr . &quot; What they do , is they confer on a person like Muhammad the status of a martyr and that would be very unfortunate , very unfortunate , because basically his message is one of hate , &quot; Hier said . Times staff writers John Balzar , Frank Clifford , Chip Johnson , Susan Moffat and Larry Stammer contributed to this story .</TEXT>
