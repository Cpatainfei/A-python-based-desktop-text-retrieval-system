   <HEADLINE> HERNANDEZ ASSOCIATE GETS PROBATION IN TAX_EVASION SCHEME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The former mortgage broker to socialite Danny Hernandez was sentenced Monday to two years of probation for bilking the federal_government out of almost $ 85 # 000 in taxes . Shawn Cassidy , 35 , had pleaded guilty in U.S. Federal_Court in August to two counts of income_tax evasion for lying on his tax_forms in 1990 and 1991 . Assistant U.S. Atty . Stephen Wolfe , who prosecuted the case , called the crimes &quot; a shame . &quot; Until he committed these offenses , he ' d been completely law-abiding and even admirable , very hard-working , &quot; Wolfe said . As mortgage broker for Hernandez , of Mission Viejo , Cassidy worked_out a scheme in which Hernandez understated his taxable income by hundreds of thousands of dollars . Cassidy told the Internal Revenue Service that he paid Hernandez $ 257 # 000 in_commissions for referring mortgage business to him . Hernandez backed_up the claim to legitimize some of the exorbitant income he was making from stealing nearly $ 8 million from the Santa Fe Springs precious_metals company where he worked . Hernandez received a 71-month prison sentence in April after pleading guilty to mail_fraud and money_laundering . His wife , Susie Hernandez , was sentenced to 16 months for her role in the scheme . Cassidy , of Encinitas , had faced_up to 10 years in a federal prison and $ 500 # 000 in fines . Prosecutors were satisfied with his relatively light sentence , which included a $ 100 fine , because of his ready admission that he committed the crimes when he was confronted by IRS investigators and his agreement to cooperate in the government ' s case against Hernandez , Wolfe said . Cassidy has since made total restitution , Wolfe said , including tens of thousands of dollars in penalties and interest .</TEXT>
