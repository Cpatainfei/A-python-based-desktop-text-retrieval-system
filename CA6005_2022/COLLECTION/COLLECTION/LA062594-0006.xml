   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR TUMBLES AS BID TO BUOY CURRENCY FALTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a day of financial turbulence and political finger-pointing , the dollar tumbled Friday , as an alliance of 17 nations failed in its bid to buoy the beleaguered U.S. currency . In turn , stocks plunged and bond yields jumped amid fears that the Federal_Reserve would have to raise interest_rates to make the dollar more attractive -- which could slow U.S. growth and hurt company profits . Central_banks of countries as large as Germany and as small as Portugal teamed_up to buy billions of dollars in their rescue effort . But after a brief , midmorning recovery , the greenback wilted further , prompting criticism of President Clinton ' s leadership and fears of higher rates . &quot; Can you believe Ireland defending the U.S. currency ? &quot; said William V . Sullivan Jr. , director of money_market research at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York . &quot; Things are bad. &quot; The Dow Jones industrial average closed_down 62.15 points Friday , the sharpest one-day fall_in almost three months . The dollar finished the day at 1.58 German marks , its bottom for the year , and 100.42 yen -- slightly above its post-World War II low reached earlier this week . In the search for blame , the rising U.S. trade_deficit and prospects of faster growth overseas were among the explanations offered Friday by economists . Yet political symbolism -- in America and overseas -- may be the driving force behind the dollar ' s current unpopularity with investors , analysts also said . Clinton ' s foreign_policy leadership has caused many currency traders to downgrade the dollar . Unsatisfactory U.S. trade squabbles with Japan and China , an appearance of White_House indecision on North_Korea and other problems all were cited Friday . Sensitive to the symbolism of a teetering national currency as well as the economic risks it raises , Clinton maintained Friday that the dollar was somehow moving_in the opposite direction of the healthy U.S. economy . &quot; This is a development that is puzzling a lot of economists because our economy is performing so well , &quot; the President told KMOX Radio in St . Louis by telephone from Air_Force One . &quot; In a funny way the currency values are running in the opposite direction of economic strength. &quot; However , Administration critics seized_on the unsettling financial news . Sen . Pete V . Domenici ( R-N . M. ) described the dollar ' s travails as a &quot; global vote of no confidence &quot; in Clinton_Administration policies . &quot; I , among many others , attribute this recent precipitous drop_in the dollar to a worldwide lack of confidence in U.S. leadership that threatens prospects for sustained future U.S. economic_growth , &quot; he said in a Senate speech . One economist , who asked not to be named , offered a more blunt appraisal : &quot; Wall_Street despises Clinton , because he ' s a Democrat . There ' s some of that going on here. &quot; Part of the explanation may be found overseas , according to some experts . The view that Japan ' s government may soon fall again has lowered expectations that Japan will settle trade disputes with the United States anytime soon . On top of that , the appearance of weak governments in Japan and the United Kingdom takes credibility away from central_bank efforts to stabilize the dollar and emboldens speculators to gamble that the dollar ' s plunge will continue , analysts said . &quot; People are saying how can these weakened governments support the dollar ? &quot; said Sullivan , pointing_out the price_tag for Friday ' s rescue operation may be in the $ 4-billion range . &quot; They know there isn ' t the political will to do this on a sustained basis. &quot; The symbolic benchmark of 100 yen-per-dollar has become a key battle_line between speculators and central bankers in recent days . The line was breached briefly on Tuesday before the dollar edged back upward . The dollar also flirted_with 100 yen in early Friday trading . For the Fed , which is responsible_for protecting the nation ' s currency , this is a major headache . If massive dollar purchases prove insufficient to prop_up the currency , the central_bank will face increasing pressure to do so by boosting interest_rates . And such rescue efforts are dubious . Just last month , for example , a concerted effort to buy dollars , perhaps in the $ 5-billion range , combined with a German interest-rate cut_to calm the markets , but only temporarily . Higher interest_rates make dollar-denominated investments more lucrative to investors , thus strengthening the currency . Yet further rate hikes would also slow the U.S. economy , which is already cooling_off from the hectic pace of growth in late 1993 . &quot; The dilemma for the Fed is clear , &quot; said Carol A . Stone , an economist at Nomura Securities International in New York . &quot; You don ' t want to make conditions worse. &quot; There are other reasons why the Fed would rather not raise interest_rates to protect the dollar . &quot; What happens the next time the dollar is weak ? &quot; asks Richard D . Rippe , chief economist at Prudential Securities . &quot; The Fed would be inviting speculation that it might tighten again. &quot; The slumping dollar poses a dilemma for Wall_Street as well , where the Dow industrial average plunged 139.84 points for the week -- or 3.7 % -- to close at its lowest finish since May 9 . Ordinarily , the current economic climate , which features moderate growth and next-to-no inflation , would be a prescription for happy investors . Yet rising interest_rates this year have hammered bond values -- and stock prices have followed . That pattern was evident Friday , as the 30-year U.S. Treasury issue dropped more_than 1 1 / 4 points , or $ 12.50 per $ 1 # 000 face amount ; its yield jumped to 7.52 % from 7.4 % Thursday . &quot; In the short run , uncertainty is the dominant issue , &quot; Rippe said . The dollar began falling early Friday , sliding against the Japanese yen in overnight trading to 100 yen , a nearly 50-year low . Shortly after the U.S. markets opened for business , the central_banks rushed in with large purchases , intended to catch speculators off_guard and alter the dollar ' s course for the day . The Fed , Germany ' s Bundesbank and central_banks of Japan , the United Kingdom , France , Canada , Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Greece , Italy , Switzerland , Portugal , Norway , the_Netherlands , Ireland and Spain all reportedly participated in the rescue operation . Word of the banks ' efforts spread through trading rooms at about 9:30 a.m. , and the dollar rallied for about 90 minutes . By midday , however , it lost its momentum and began to drift sideways or lower , traders said . Yet if the episode was unresolved on Friday , few observers were confident that the central_banks could prevail over the currency markets . &quot; They ' d have to do_it ( buy dollars ) on a much larger scale than they did today , and I think they ' d have to keep doing_it repeatedly next week , &quot; said Bruce Steinberg , an economist with the Merrill Lynch investment_firm in New York . Longer term , economists said , recoveries in Japan and Western Europe will pick_up steam , meaning that the demand for U.S. exports will surge -- shrinking the U.S. trade_deficit -- and the dollar is likely to edge upward once more . Short term , however , many were betting_on a lower dollar . &quot; This is the central_bank version of the World Cup -- and they ' re losing , &quot; Michael Strauss , chief economist at Yamaichi International ( America ) , told Reuters . * CALIFORNIA BLUES : Rising rates further threaten the state ' s recovery .
