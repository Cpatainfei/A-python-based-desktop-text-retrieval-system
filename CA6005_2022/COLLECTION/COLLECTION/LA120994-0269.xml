   <HEADLINE> GOVERNOR TAKES OATH PEACEFULLY IN CHIAPAS ; RIVAL DOES TOO ; MEXICO : BOTH PROMISE REFORM IN TROUBLED SOUTHERN STATE . COUNTRY WAITS TO SEE IF ZAPATISTA REBELS WILL END TRUCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two men took the oath of office Thursday to be governor of the deeply divided southern state of Chiapas , both promising a new constitution and electoral reform . Eduardo Robledo Rincon , the ruling party candidate and official winner of the Aug . 21 election , was inaugurated during a special legislative session at the modernistic City Theater with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo in_attendance . The installation of Amado Avendano , who charges that the election was stolen from him by vote fraud , took_place an hour later at the main plaza several blocks away , where 3 # 000 protesters gathered_in front of the Statehouse to witness a Mayan ceremony of incense and chanting in the unrelenting sun . Both events were peaceful . Demonstrators who had marched from all_over the state to protest Robledo ' s inauguration did not attempt to confront the tight security surrounding the theater . Police guarding the Statehouse watched the plaza ceremony indifferently and protesters did not disturb the police barricades . However , tensions remained high as Mexicans waited to find_out whether the Zapatista National Liberation Army will carry_out its threat to break its uneasy truce with the government once Robledo takes_office . The rebels , who briefly took_control of four county_seats last New Year ' s Day , have said that Avendano will be recognized as governor in any territory they control . The inauguration_day was the first measure of how Zedillo ' s week-old administration would respond to both the rebels and to nonviolent protests . His campaign was based largely on the promise of stability after a convulsive year that began with the Zapatista uprising in this impoverished state and continued with two major political assassinations and a rash of kidnapings . &quot; My presence in Chiapas is for peace , &quot; Zedillo said in a speech . &quot; I come_to Chiapas to assume the demands of those who live_in conditions of misery that undermine the lives and dignity of thousands of men and women , especially in Indian communities. &quot; He repeated orders to the Mexican armed forces to continue the cease-fire in_effect since mid-January and he called_for negotiation and dialogue , without mentioning the Zapatistas by name . Despite the efforts of both sides to prevent violence , animosities were still obvious . For example , Robledo attempted to follow Zedillo ' s example of conciliation with other parties by offering key state Cabinet posts to members of the opposition . When leftist Eraclio Zepeda accepted the position of Interior minister , Avendano called it &quot; regrettable. &quot; The crowd around him was harsher , yelling , &quot; Traitor ! &quot; Avendano , a crusading newspaper_publisher who was the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party , made clear that his parallel government will be a peaceful protest that will not include taking_over any government buildings . In other states , opposition parties have forced the governors ' resignation by blockading government buildings , preventing the conduct of state business . &quot; We lack the minimum infrastructure to be able to function , because the government has appropriated the goods and real_estate that belong_to us , the people , &quot; Avendano said as supporters chanted , &quot; The people voted , Amado won. &quot; &quot; It will take a lot of work for us to recover peacefully that to which we have a right , &quot; he said . &quot; We are going_to make democracy with our own hands. &quot; He proposed a constitutional convention with representatives from each county in the state and an electoral reform law . During his inauguration speech , Robledo renewed his offer to resign if that would persuade the Zapatistas to lay_down their arms . He offered a 12-point government program that includes a new constitution with electoral reform , to be written by the state legislature . He also proposed an Indian rights law and the creation of plebiscites and referendums , which so far do not exist in Mexico . The new governor also came_down strongly in favor of law and order , a growing demand in a state that many citizens say has become ungovernable . Since the uprising , increasing numbers of peasant groups have invaded plantations , demanding that the government confiscate the land and turn it over to them , a process known in Mexico as &quot; redistribution. &quot; Besides judicial reform , Robledo offered a new agrarian law &quot; to redistribute that ( land ) which can be redistributed , make productive what has been redistributed and to respect that which cannot be redistributed. &quot; He emphasized development as the key to solving the state ' s problems . &quot; The costs of a long history of inequality , which we have paid in 1994 , have been very high , &quot; he said .
