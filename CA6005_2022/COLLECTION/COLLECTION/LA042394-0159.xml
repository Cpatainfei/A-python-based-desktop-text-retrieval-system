   <HEADLINE> SOUTH_AMERICA ; CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM FLICKERS OUT IN BRAZIL ; DEADLINE NEARS FOR FINAL REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENT ' S 245 ARTICLES . IN NEARLY SEVEN MONTHS , LAWMAKERS HAVE PASSED FOUR REFORMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One day early this month , in a silent hall of Congress , Inocencio de Oliveira , president of Brazil ' s Chamber of Deputies , saw the electronic panel that registers the congressional head_count flashing bad news . The deadline for revising Brazil ' s constitution was approaching , and once again there would be no quorum that day in Brasilia , the nation ' s capital . &quot; The reform is dead , &quot; Oliveira said before a gallery of empty seats . &quot; It ' s just a matter of burying it. &quot; Since Brazil became independent in 1822 , the highest law in the land has been redone seven times . The latest constitution , written in 1988 , was supposed to be different . It righted many wrongs , burying the fiat of earlier regimes by strengthening Congress and restoring power and revenue to neglected states and towns . It addressed the need for food for the hungry , work for the unemployed and shelter for the homeless . The constitution promised so_much -- &quot; heaven on earth , &quot; one former minister was fond of saying -- that it became almost impossible to implement . But the 1988 legislature had thought to include a safety_valve : a clause to hold the document , with its 245 articles , up for review in five years . That review was launched , as planned , last October . It was scrapped , for all practical purposes , last week , a victim of the fractious politics that only a thorough review might have mended . Not that legislators didn ' t try . When Congressman Nelson Jobim , the rapporteur of the review process , opened the first reform session , he had a startling 17 # 000 amendments on his desk . But many of Jobim ' s colleagues were put_off by his brusque , arbitrary ways . They blocked the review with stonewalling tactics or merely by staying away . The parties of the left , led by Luis Inacio Lula da Silva ' s Workers ' Party , would hear no talk_of dismantling state-run enterprises or reversing the social_welfare benefits they authored in 1988 . The right_wing did its best to do just that , arguing that such policies are driving Brasilia to bankruptcy . Many politicians were preoccupied during the reform process by the drawn-out investigations into corruption in the legislature . Many more were distracted by their own campaigns for the Oct . 3 general_elections . As a result , in close to seven months , four amendments passed the obligatory two rounds of votes . Most dealt with minor matters . The list of things undone is enormous . The political_system remains lopsided , for example . There are 19 political_parties represented in Congress , and electoral rules give legislators from small states proportionately far more power than those from large ones . This often leaves the president hostage to the demands of tiny parties and states . There are still a_few working_days left for Congress before the revision deadline expires May 31 . But no one believes that Congress can , or should , try to do_in a_few sessions the job it has neglected for half a year . Instead , Oliveira and Jobim are pushing to delay the review until after the October elections . Most of the benefits of a new charter would not take_effect until 1996 . A delay could be costly . The social_welfare system is hemorrhaging money . New investment is hamstrung by constitutional restrictions on foreign capital . And while lawmakers in 1988 proudly reserved &quot; strategic &quot; sectors such_as mining , petroleum and telecommunications for the state , these sectors are now broke . &quot; The delayed reform is bad news for the longer-term health of the economic plan , &quot; said Walder de Goes , a Brazilian political_scientist . &quot; And each plan that fails is one more reason for the people not to believe the next one. &quot; Halting Reform In nearly seven months , Brazil ' s Congress has passed four items of constitutional reform : The social emergency fund , a $ 16-billion account that gives Brasilia the flexibility to pay its bills without printing money and driving_up inflation . An amendment giving Congress more powers to summon Cabinet_ministers for interrogation . An 18-month suspension of the political rights of ministers caught abusing the powers of their office . A law allowing Brazilian citizens with foreign passports the right to dual citizenship .</TEXT>
