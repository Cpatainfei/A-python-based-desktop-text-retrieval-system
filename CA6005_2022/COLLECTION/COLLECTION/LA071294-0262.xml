   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; AGENCIES THAT POLICE AIR , SEA MAY ISSUE ' TICKETS ' TO POLLUTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal_government ' s environmental sentries have a new request for polluters : license and registration , please . The U.S. Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency , taking a hint from the highway patrol , want to start issuing tickets . As the federal_government ' s chief watchdogs of air and sea purity , the agencies are charged with punishing oil spillers and waste dumpers . Officials say &quot; pulling over &quot; environmental lawbreakers and imposing on-the-spot fines will cut paperwork and protect the planet . The Coast Guard is testing the waters with a &quot; notice of violation &quot; initiative at three ports around the country , including Long_Beach . When Coast Guard officers arrive on the scene of an oil spill , they assess the size of the accident and write the tickets -- but unlike their radar gun-wielding counterparts , they do not have to lie_in_wait for lawbreakers . Ocean-going vessels are required to call the Coast Guard whenever they spill hazardous substances . Although major environmental catastrophes such_as the Exxon Valdez oil spill make headlines , more_than 90 % of the oil accidents the Coast Guard deals with involve fewer than 100 gallons , Lt . Cmdr . Rick Gaudiosi said . Violators may pay the penalty , which can range from $ 50 to $ 1 # 000 , within 30 days or appeal for a federal hearing . Tickets can only be issued for spills of less than 100 gallons , which are typically caused by small leaks or piping problems . Under existing policy , lawbreakers wait months for the Coast Guard to assess the amount of a fine and process the paperwork required to issue a penalty . Ticketing eliminates much of the red_tape and puts more authority in the hands of individual Coast Guard officers , agency officials said . &quot; This is a lot more open than the old way when people never knew what they were getting , &quot; said Petty_Officer Randy Young , who recently issued a $ 250 ticket to a commercial vessel that had spilled nine gallons of fuel . &quot; It ' s a really reasonable thing to pay_for a spill. &quot; Young , whose office has issued about 40 citations since March , patrols off Long_Beach . The other ports in the pilot_program are Charleston , S.C. , and Galveston , Tex . The Coast Guard will evaluate the six-month program and consider making_it permanent policy later this summer . Public response has been overwhelmingly positive so far , Gaudiosi said . Although no one is happy to pay fines , &quot; they like the instant gratification &quot; of on-the-spot tickets , he said . At the EPA , officials also are discussing giving agency field inspectors the authority to issue on-site citations for minor violations of the Clean Air Act and impose fines of up_to $ 5 # 000 per day . Agency officials have not defined a &quot; minor &quot; violation , but they expect most citations will involve improper record-keeping and other paperwork-related offenses . The agency is pleased with its ability to punish big-time lawbreakers , winning 98 % of its legal cases , spokeswoman Wendy Butler said . But issuing tickets would allow the agency to streamline its pursuit of small-time violators . &quot; We ' re trying to plug the holes , &quot; Butler said . &quot; It might not be that individual violations have a tremendous environmental impact , but the cumulative effect of a lot of small violations &quot; is significant , she said . If the program is successful , the agency is likely to consider extending ticket authority to field_officers who would be able to dock polluters for breaking clean water and conservation_laws as well , officials said . The agency also is considering monetary rewards to citizens who report violations of the Clean Air Act that result in fines or criminal convictions . EPA officials would pay_up to $ 10 # 000 to anyone who tips_off the agency . Informants would be required to provide highly detailed accounts of a violation . The whistle-blowers approach could save the EPA money , said one official , noting that federal agencies are operating under increasingly tight financial constraints . &quot; We can ' t do all_the enforcement ourselves , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
