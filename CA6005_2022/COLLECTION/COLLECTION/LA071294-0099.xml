   <HEADLINE> STEEP RISE IN BIRTHS TO TEEN-AGERS IS REPORTED ; PREGNANCY : THE BIGGEST INCREASE IS AMONG 13- AND 14-YEAR-OLD GIRLS . A COUNTY TASK_FORCE HOPES TO FORM A COMMUNITY COALITION TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The number of Ventura County girls ages 13 to 16 years old who are having babies has risen dramatically over the past eight years , a new report shows . The report by the Ventura County Task_Force to Prevent Teen Pregnancy , which will be presented today to the county Board of Supervisors , shows the number of babies born to teen-agers younger than 17 years old has increased by about 46 % , from 147 in 1986 to 214 in 1993 . The increase is highest among 13- and 14-year-olds , for whom the number of births has risen by three-quarters from 16 in 1986 to 28 in 1993 . To address the problem , the task_force is calling_on county supervisors to help organize a countywide coalition of religious institutions , schools , nonprofit agencies and youth clubs , task_force chairwoman Judy Bysshe said . &quot; If we really want to address teen pregnancy , we need to have a community-wide effort , &quot; Bysshe said . The coalition would have at least two aims : to encourage teen-agers to abstain_from sexual_activity and to provide child_care , job training and other support to teen-age mothers . Appointed by county supervisors two years ago and headed by the Ventura County Commission on Women , the teen pregnancy task_force consisted_of about three dozen people from across the political spectrum -- from representatives of anti-abortion groups to local directors of Planned Parenthood . Despite their different perspectives on some issues , such_as abortion and the use of contraceptives by teen-agers , task_force members began their study with one shared premise : that young_girls should not be having babies , Bysshe said . * Teen-agers who have children often drop_out of high_school or , if they graduate , fail to attend college or get the vocational_training they need to land good jobs , task_force members said . Without good-paying jobs and frequently without any help from the children ' s fathers , many young mothers become mired in poverty . Not only are most teen-agers ill-prepared to become parents , task_force members said , but many are also too young to have sexual_relationships . &quot; We agree that teens should be abstinent , &quot; said Nikki Davis , a task_force member who heads a county public health program for teen-age parents . &quot; that ' s something we all would like to see. &quot; After holding focus groups with roughly 120 county teen-agers , task_force members concluded that many young people become sexually active for the wrong reasons . They are pressured by partners into having_sex or they use physical intimacy to make_up for an absence of emotional warmth in their lives , they said . Although the state_Department of Education already requires schools to discuss the benefits of sexual abstinence as part of sex education , task_force members said educators could emphasize the topic even more . &quot; It needs to be implemented more in sex education curricula , &quot; said April Fernandez , a task_force member and director of the Planned Parenthood center in Ventura . In addition , children need to hear messages about sexual abstinence in other places besides the classroom , task_force members said . &quot; They need to hear it from everyone in their community , &quot; said task_force member Karen Johnson , who is_on the board of the Crisis Pregnancy Center in Thousand Oaks , an organization opposed to abortion that advises pregnant teen-agers about alternatives to abortion . * Religious institutions , Boys &amp; Girls clubs and other groups could launch comprehensive programs to teach teen-agers how to resist pressures to have_sex before they are ready , Bysshe said . Community groups will have to do most of the work to reduce the number of teen-age pregnancies in the county because the cash-strapped county lacks the money for such efforts , she said . &quot; The bottom_line is there isn ' t any cash to do any program , &quot; Bysshe said . &quot; The only way anything is going_to happen is that agencies pull together. &quot; Births Among Ventura County Teens 07 # 17 , 06 # 05 , 05 # 04 , 07 # 05 Age of Mother 13 14 15 16 Total Births per year 1986 2 14 36 95 147 1987 15 22 70 8 115 1988 4 11 51 117 183 1989 2 16 48 125 191 1990 1 16 55 116 188 1991 2 13 59 136 210 1992 25 * 25 * 67 154 246 1993 28 * 28 * 45 141 214 * Includes both 13- and 14-year-olds Source : Ventura County Task_Force to Prevent Teen Pregnancy</TEXT>
