   <HEADLINE> WORKPLACE SMOKING BANS RAISE CONCERNS ; REGULATION : WITH MORE LOCALITIES IMPOSING CONTROLS , QUESTIONS ABOUND ON HOW FAR THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GO TO ENSURE EMPLOYEE SAFETY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carol Isen , a teacher and tutor of grade_school children , is a nonsmoker who says she welcomes the growing nationwide movement toward eliminating smoking in the workplace . However , as someone who works both in the classroom and in private homes , she wonders just how far such restrictions should go . &quot; I would not tutor in a house where there is smoking , but that ' s my personal choice , &quot; the Rockville , Md. , resident said . &quot; I don ' t believe the government should be legislating homes . I think that ' s way too much. &quot; Her sentiments reflect a growing number of concerns being raised across the country as the federal_government and many states , cities and municipalities propose or enact far-reaching restrictions against smoking in the workplace . While ardent anti-smokers are overjoyed about the changes , businesses -- from restaurants to hotels to bowling_alleys -- fear heavy economic losses if smoking is banned in their establishments . Those fears persist despite early studies indicating no financial hardships actually occur . But beyond those sharply focused , pragmatic concerns loom larger questions of precisely how to define a workplace and how much government regulation is too_much . Should people whose homes double as places_of_business -- caterers , plumbers , child-care providers , for instance -- be required to maintain smoke-free environments ? Should a guest be forbidden to smoke in the privacy of his or her hotel_room just because a maid comes_in to clean ? Furthermore , how difficult will such rules be to enforce -- particularly when workers themselves may_not be willing to complain about the practices of their colleagues ? And who will be responsible_for enforcement ? Governments and other institutions are only beginning to come_to grips with the issues . &quot; In most health regulations involving protecting workers from pollution , you can say the pollution is being caused by the company , whereas here , the pollution is also being caused by the workers , &quot; said Dr. Sidney Wolfe , director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group , an advocacy group that has pushed for worker protections against toxic substances . &quot; In many ways , workplace smoking bans will be daunting to enforce , especially if they involve workers reluctant to rat on their co-workers , &quot; he said . Numerous state and local jurisdictions have enacted -- or are trying to initiate -- policies that regulate workplace smoking . And the federal_government , which traditionally has lagged behind the states and cities in this area , has proposed similar work-site bans . The Labor_Department ' s Occupational Health and Safety Administration has put forth a proposal to ban smoking in the nation ' s work sites , and the Pentagon already has executed such a ban worldwide , affecting 3 million employees . Furthermore , Congress is deliberating legislation that would prohibit smoking in all public places , including malls , sporting arenas , office_buildings and federal , state and local_government buildings . The bill now exempts restaurants , prisons and tobacco_shops . But its author , Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health , has made_it clear that he intends to include &quot; family-style &quot; restaurants in the legislation . The bill has been approved by the subcommittee but has not yet been taken_up by the full committee . Also , California and Maryland recently enacted what are believed to be the toughest workplace smoking bans in the nation . On July 21 , Gov . Pete Wilson signed a sweeping provision that will take_effect Jan . 1 unless California voters approve a pro-tobacco initiative , sponsored by Philip Morris Inc. , that would substantially weaken it . The California law exempts private residences , unless they serve as day_care_centers for children ; most hotel_rooms , lobbies and banquet halls , as long as no food is being served ; bars and card clubs ; cabs of trucks ; medical facilities doing research on smoking , and theaters and movie sets where smoking is part of the script . Maryland ' s law banning smoking was scheduled to take_effect Aug . 1 but was temporarily blocked in the courts . The restrictions include home_offices if employees other_than the homeowner work there . Much of the concern in Maryland has been expressed by the hospitality industry , which is worried that the law will be interpreted to include hotel_rooms , where maids do their work . The proposals with the potential for the greatest impact are those pending at the federal level , but they could take the longest_time to implement . Without weakening amendments , passage of Waxman ' s legislation could be difficult , and it could be many years before the OSHA rules take_effect . Furthermore , OSHA has yet to tackle some of the tougher questions surrounding its proposal , such_as defining the workplace , but the agency &quot; has the flexibility and capability &quot; of doing_it &quot; carefully enough so as_to hit all_the traditional workplaces without infringing on what is typically thought of as an individual ' s private space , &quot; said Matthew Myers , an attorney who represents the anti-smoking Coalition on Smoking OR Health . OSHA could choose to define a workplace by the number of employees , for example , or by the amount_of_time spent working there , said Myers , whose coalition represents the American Cancer Society , the American Heart Assn . and the American Lung Assn . OSHA traditionally has treated small businesses differently from large ones , and its rules have not in the past &quot; been construed to include peoples ' homes , &quot; Wolfe said . And , Myers said , &quot; the agency has the ability to define this quite carefully and precisely , even though they haven ' t done_it yet. &quot; OSHA officials refused to discuss the proposals during its rule-making process . The period for public comment on the proposal ends Saturday and will be followed by a series of public hearings in the fall . After that , OSHA is expected to propose more detailed final rules . Under the swiftest scenario , it could be three years or more before the rules take_effect -- and they almost certainly will face legal challenges from the tobacco_industry , likely causing further delays . In the meantime , states , cities and even individual businesses may get there first . &quot; We knew it was certainly a risk , but we ' re living proof that it hasn ' t hurt our business , &quot; said Sarah Goldsmith , a spokeswoman for California Pizza Kitchen , which three years ago instituted a no-smoking policy for the restaurants in its nationwide chain . &quot; We wanted to offer a smoke-free environment as much to our workers as_to our patrons , &quot; Goldsmith said . California Pizza Kitchen is believed to be the first restaurant_chain to impose such a ban . In the past year , several others , mostly fast-food outlets , have followed . California Pizza Kitchen , which has bars in many of its restaurants , has experienced no economic hardship as a result of the policy , she said . Indeed , on a recent weeknight in Washington , there was a minimum 40-minute wait for a table . &quot; We ' ve had a very positive response to the policy , and our sales continue to increase , &quot; she said . Goldsmith ' s view is supported by at least one recent study . The research , conducted by Stanton A . Glantz and Lisa R . A . Smith of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UC San Francisco , analyzed sales tax data from 15 cities in California and Colorado with smoke-free ordinances and compared the statistics to those in cities of similar income , population and smoking prevalence that did not have bans . They found that restaurant business had not suffered as a result of the ordinances . The work was published in the July issue of the American Journal of Public Health . Despite the growing pains of instituting such policies , many experts say they believe that the momentum cannot be stopped . Regardless of the stumbling_blocks , &quot; we , as a nation , are moving_in the direction of . . . protecting nonsmokers in the workplace , &quot; Myers said . &quot; The only real question is how long it will take. &quot;</TEXT>
