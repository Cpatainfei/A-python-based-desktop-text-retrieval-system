   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; PEACE DEPENDS_ON ISRAELI SAFETY , BETTER ARAB LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dynamics of peacemaking in the Middle_East changed dramatically Wednesday when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed the agreement on Palestinian self-rule . Peace now depends less on bold moves by courageous leaders like Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and far more on the ability of tens of thousands of people to make the agreement work , day in and day out , so that coexistence and cooperation replace confrontation and conflict . If Palestinians get from autonomy the sense that life is improving , they will become believers in the efficacy of negotiations and seek a political solution to their statelessness and impoverishment . If they do not , they will return to the gun to achieve what this agreement failed to bring . If Israelis feel safe , if not safer , as a result of the accord , they will be ready to yield more territory for peace -- in the West_Bank , the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon . And if Israelis find their security diminished , they will oppose even the extension of Palestinian autonomy . That is the broad logic underlying the agreement . Rabin put it plainly : &quot; Without security for Israel and new hope for the Palestinians , the objectives of the agreement won ' t be achieved. &quot; But the relationship is as complex as it is direct . The Palestinians ' focus has been and remains on the future -- the independent state they hope will come_after five years of autonomy , if not sooner . The Israeli focus is_on the operational , the here_and_now . &quot; Peace should never become so prosaic that it will be reduced to municipal chores like street repairs and trash_collection , &quot; said Mahdi Abdul Hadi , a prominent Palestinian political_scientist . &quot; But we will be measured and tested by our ability to give our children an education , to improve health_care , to create jobs . . . . Political power is always to be used for betterment. &quot; But the PLO has always given primacy to Palestinian dignity in asserting its people ' s right to self-determination and independence . On Wednesday , Rabin hammered the PLO hard for its lack of preparedness for assuming control of the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank city of Jericho ; he asserted that the PLO is interested more in stamps , flags and other symbols than in real governance . &quot; The main question now -- a big , big if -- is whether the Palestinians can control the area , whether they can provide the education , the health_care , the jobs , what Gaza needs , &quot; commented Ori Orr , chairman of the influential foreign affairs and defense committee of the Knesset , the Israeli Parliament . &quot; This agreement succeeds or falls on this . If the Gaza refugees don ' t see some kind of light ahead , an improvement in their miserable lives , they will pick_up the knife , the gun again . . . . The main problem before us is the PLO ' s ability to rule. &quot; Sufyan abu Zaideh , a long-imprisoned leader of Arafat ' s Fatah movement in Gaza , acknowledged that the PLO is not prepared to govern there -- that three weeks will be needed to deploy the new Palestine police in the region and at least three months to establish a governmental structure . &quot; This is not because you are Jews and we are Arabs , &quot; he told an Israel Television_reporter , &quot; but because you ' re a state and we ' re an organization scattered among many countries. &quot; Palestinian leaders in Gaza and the West_Bank are acutely aware of the need to deliver -- and worried by what failure would mean . &quot; Popular support for the PLO is tied to progress , not just progress in the peace process but to changes in daily life , &quot; Tawfik Mabhouh , a leader of the pro-Communist Palestine People ' s Party , said in Gaza City . &quot; There is no real conviction here in favor of this settlement , but there is a hope of change -- a hope that we can do a better job than the Israelis did for 27 years. &quot; Palestinian task_forces have been planning the PLO assumption of power for more_than two years . There are detailed programs for education , health_care , agriculture , industrial development , even an electrical grid . Thousands of potential officials , many with impressive professional qualifications and some with years of experience abroad , have been identified . Yet there is total uncertainty about tomorrow . Although the agreement signed Wednesday morning by Arafat and Rabin laid_down a timetable for the Israeli withdrawal and the Palestinian assumption of power , neither side could say Wednesday evening what , in fact , will happen this week or next -- when Israeli forces will pull_out of Gaza , when the Palestine police will arrive , who precisely will assume responsibility for water , hospitals or schools . At the end of the negotiations in Cairo in the small hours of Wednesday morning , Rabin took Arafat aside and talked to him seriously about all these problems . At the end of that very private talk , a tired Arafat was heard promising Rabin to &quot; do my best. &quot; Much depends_on Arafat ' s success . Israelis see the Gaza-Jericho agreement very much as a test not only for the Palestinians but for their other Arab neighbors . Speaking after signing the agreement , Rabin again told Arafat , &quot; The people of Israel hope you will not disappoint us. &quot; Most Israelis , whether they approved or not , recognized the agreement signed Wednesday as a major step toward a Palestinian state ; the question for them was what this will mean for Israel ' s security . A hostile Palestine would not threaten the existence of Israel , but it could make life hell . &quot; A large majority of Palestinians does not accept the existence of the Jewish state and wants to destroy the Jewish state , &quot; Gerald Steinberg of Bar Ilan University said . &quot; The question is whether through this agreement we will channel this conflict . . . into more diplomatic ways that are easier for us to live with. &quot; From the outset , Rabin has been clear about his goal of extricating Israel from the pain of occupation and the ultimately unwinnable conflict that the Palestinians intensified with their intifada , the rebellion begun in 1987 after 20 years of Israeli rule . There was a major strategic factor as well -- securing a comprehensive peace in the Middle_East that would turn now-hostile Arab neighbors into a buffer zone against the advance of militant Islam . But all depends_on the workability of the Gaza-Jericho agreement , with its effort to give Palestinians sufficient incentives in the future -- principally their own state throughout the West_Bank and Gaza Strip -- so they realize the medium-term goals of what amounts to a form of collective_security with Israel , as well as economic cooperation .</TEXT>
