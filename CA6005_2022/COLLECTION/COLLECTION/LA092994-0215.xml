   <HEADLINE> 800 LOST AT_SEA IN FERRY DISASTER ; BALTIC_SEA : THERE ARE 126 SURVIVORS FROM THE VESSEL THAT SAILED FROM ESTONIA FOR SWEDEN . A CREW_MEMBER IS QUOTED AS SAYING A LOADING RAMP WAS IMPROPERLY CLOSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two boats arrived here late Wednesday night carrying 32 survivors of a sunken Estonian passenger ferry who had been scooped from the swollen Baltic_Sea . Their arrival at the chilly harbor-front terminal brought whimpers of relief from desperate relatives but also brought_to a bittersweet close the most tragic day on the Baltic since World_War_II . Authorities say the Swedish survivors are probably the last passengers from the doomed ferry who will be found alive , bringing the tally of those rescued to 126 . Estimates vary of the number of people aboard the ferry when it sank_in a severe storm early Wednesday en route to the Swedish capital , but authorities fear that more_than 800 people are dead . Rescue boats and helicopters braved high winds and pitching seas all day , checking and double-checking life_rafts for survivors and making several miraculous snatches from the 50-degree water . But officials in Turku , Finland , where the rescue was organized , called_off the search at nightfall because of safety concerns . &quot; There is very little hope of finding anyone alive , &quot; said Finnish Coast Guard Capt . Raimo Tiilikainen , who said the search for bodies will resume at dawn today . By sundown Wednesday , 42 had been found . For hundreds of family members holed_up in a hotel not far from the Stockholm ferry terminal , where the boat Estonia was to have docked Wednesday morning after an overnight trip from the Estonian capital of Tallinn , the suspended rescue effort was just the latest in a day of heartbreaking reports . Officials said the majority of those on board the Estonia were Swedes , including about 60 civilian employees of the Stockholm Police_Department , several dozen members of a Swedish senior_citizens club and several judges returning home after visiting Estonian counterparts . Authorities said the ship carried passengers from Sweden , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Canada , Russia , Nigeria , Finland , Norway , Britain and Belarus . &quot; It is a very big shock for everyone , &quot; said Stockholm Police_Chief Richard Sevelius . &quot; There is nothing to compare it with. &quot; Social_workers said a young pregnant woman went_into premature labor when she learned her fiance was not among those rescued , and other despondent relatives fainted or broke_into hysterics as the hours of uncertainty dragged_on . Dozens of counselors , clergymen and other volunteers tended distraught family members , whose counterparts gathered_in Tallinn and in Turku , where most survivors in need of immediate medical_care were taken . &quot; I can ' t describe how horrible it was to watch as an 11-year-old boy realized he had lost his father , &quot; said a glassy-eyed Carl Tosterud , a 20-year-old Red_Cross volunteer at the Stockholm ferry terminal . &quot; There are enormous tragedies wherever you turn. &quot; One woman standing near the docks at the Tallinn waterfront clutched a teddy_bear and wept . &quot; My husband and son were_on their way to Sweden , &quot; she said . &quot; My son left his teddy_bear behind. &quot; Wednesday was declared a national day of mourning in Sweden , Estonia and Finland , and the prime_ministers of the three countries met in Finland to coordinate the rescue effort and launch an investigation . &quot; It was a terrible night for Estonia , &quot; declared Estonian Prime_Minister Mart Laar , saying it reminded him of another Baltic tragedy in 1944 when many Estonians drowned trying to flee the occupying Soviet army . &quot; It is a human tragedy beyond belief , &quot; said Swedish Prime_Minister Carl Bildt , &quot; the worst disaster in my country in at least a century. &quot; Officials from the three countries would not speculate about the cause of the accident , saying the ferry first needs to be recovered from the sea floor and analyzed . But several Scandinavian and Estonian news_reports quoted a surviving crew_member as saying that one of the ferry ' s loading ramps was not closed properly , allowing water to rush in . &quot; There was something wrong , &quot; crew_member Henrik Sillaste said , according to the reports . &quot; The outer ramp was closed but the inner door was not properly attached . Water was forcing its way through . There was so_much water on the lower deck that it almost reached my knees. &quot; Carl-Gustaf Akerhielm , spokesman for the ferryboat ' s co-owner , Estline , would not comment , saying &quot; there are so many rumors around &quot; that he did not want to guess which ones might be true . He also would not comment on reports that two Swedish ferry inspectors , apparently on a training mission , had noted defects in the loading ramp doors prior to the ship ' s departure Tuesday night . &quot; I don ' t have a clear idea , and I am not going_to speculate , &quot; Akerhielm said . &quot; I cannot assume a major fault with the vessel . For me it is a mystery , and I am very astonished. &quot; Authorities said bad_weather alone would not have been enough to sink the 515-foot-long boat , which in addition to its passengers carried 77 vehicles . Kari Lehtola , an official with the Finnish Ministry of Justice and a member of the investigation team , said it is not unusual for ferries to operate_on the Baltic in bad_weather . The Estonia , which sank about six hours into its sea crossing , was blasted by 20-foot waves and 56-m.p.h winds . &quot; They sail this route every day of the year , &quot; Lehtola said . The Estonia , built_in 1980 in West Germany and owned by the Swedish company Nordstrom &amp; Thulin and the state Estonian Shipping Co. , issued a distress_signal at 1:24 a.m. that was picked_up by the Coast Guard in Turku . Estonian Transport Minister Andi Meister said the crew actually sent two Mayday signals before going_down , but the vessel ' s automated distress system , which would have signaled its exact coordinates , did not work . By the time the first of 16 rescue boats arrived_at the scene near the Finnish island of Uto two hours later , the ferry was nowhere in_sight . Some passengers said it took only a matter of minutes for it to sink . &quot; Mayday ! Here is Estonia ! Outside Uto lighthouse . We have listed 20 to 30 degrees , &quot; the Finnish Coast Guard quoted the distress_signal . Communication then broke_off . Passenger Lars Lamke , a Stockholm doctor who survived the disaster , said many people were sleeping when the boat began to list uncontrollably . Clad in green hospital-issued pajamas in Turku , a hospital identity tag hanging_around his neck , 63-year-old Lamke was able to describe in detail the way it felt to be aboard the fast-sinking ship -- impressions that may prove useful in the coming days and weeks as investigators try to piece together what happened . &quot; I realized something was wrong when all_of my luggage started rushing down &quot; toward the door of his sleeping compartment , Lamke said . By that time , he said , the ship was tilting so severely that he found it hard to push the baggage aside and open the door . Lamke said it may have been the location of his sleeping quarters that saved him . He was_on the sixth floor of the ship , and the life_rafts were just upstairs on the seventh . He made his way toward the stairs with his companion , who is missing and presumed dead , climbed to the top , opened the door and felt a fierce wind blowing . Rescuers found Lamke ' s raft just as the sky was starting to get light . A helicopter took him and his lifeboat mates to a small military_hospital on the Finnish coastal island of Uto , and then moved them to Turku . Many of those brought there needed intensive measures to warm them up , but Lamke needed only an X-ray and some stitches for a cut on his left_hand . Lamke ' s doctor says that the emotional wounds that he and the others have suffered will take far longer to heal . &quot; They have all sustained a kind of mental shock , &quot; said Juha Niinkoski , head of the cardiology unit at Turku University Hospital . &quot; They will have difficulties in the coming days as they realize what really happened. &quot; Murphy reported from Stockholm and Walsh from Turku , Finland . Times special correspondents Lisa Trei and Eva Tarm in Tallinn , Estonia , also contributed to this report .
