   <HEADLINE> IS THE SUMMIT NOW IMPERILED ? ; REFORM PRIME_MINISTER HAS GROUND KNOCKED_OUT FROM UNDER HIM BY JAPANESE PARLIAMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The question Washington has to be asking now is whether it makes any sense to go_ahead with the planned summit on Feb . 11 between President Clinton and the progressive but embattled Japanese prime_minister . To American eyes and ears , Morihiro Hosokawa has been little short of a godsend . Since taking_office five months ago , the reform-minded prime_minister has seemed to be exactly what the doctor ordered for soothing tense U.S.-Japanese relations . He has begun to open_up markets , even the seemingly sacred rice trade , and has signaled across the Pacific that he favors more open trade and deregulated markets -- even a tax cut for Japanese consumers . But Friday , this new-age politician suffered a stunning , potentially devastating defeat in the upper house of Japan ' s Parliament when his reform proposals were quashed . It was a huge setback -- the first time since 1951 that any government-submitted bill had been voted_down . Ominously , two previous governments were toppled on the issue of political reform . Worse yet , Hosokawa had staked the very rationale of his government on achieving reform before proceeding on other issues . Does Friday ' s vote mean the brilliant Mr. Hosokawa ' s political end is near ? One certainly hopes not . Perhaps Hosokawa can stay_on his feet , pointing_out that his governing coalition at least made a good try at the biggest reform in Japan ' s electoral_system since the U.S.-written constitution was put into effect in 1947 . In fact , after his defeat , Hosokawa could have resigned or called_for new parliamentary elections . Instead , for better or for worse , he has opted to try_for a compromise with his opponents . But that won ' t be easy -- and the deadline for a deal is Saturday , when the legislative session is scheduled to end . If somehow they still could be enacted , Hosokawa ' s reforms would help Japan emerge from its gridlocked , tradition-bound system . They would also be valuable to the United States . The political disarray in Japan is a potentially severe and possibly fatal setback to ongoing U.S.-Japan trade talks . Only a stable Tokyo can focus_on Japan ' s many current problems , including the brewing showdown with a Clinton_Administration determined to bring_down a $ 50-billion trade_deficit with Japan . Hosokawa has indicated no plans to call a new election -- a move that would escalate the stakes in Japan . But that might be precisely the card to play if Parliament is ever to wake_up . Moreoever , a new election would give Japanese voters a chance to boot_out old-style politicians who have repeatedly blocked political reform . No matter what path Hosokawa takes , the trade imbalance has become intolerable and must be reduced . The Japanese Parliament has simply made the road rougher .</TEXT>
