   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENING : JUZO ITAMI BURIES HIS MISCHIEVOUS IMPULSES IN ' THE FUNERAL '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Juzo Itami got edgier as his directing career grew . Just think_about &quot; Tampopo &quot; or &quot; A Taxing Woman. &quot; In those movies , his humor can be sardonic to_the_point of serrated as he grins at a Japan co-opted by the West . But in his first picture , &quot; The Funeral , &quot; Itami was more subdued , even reflective . The 1984 serio-comedy ( which screens Friday night as part of UC Irvine ' s &quot; Off the Beaten Path &quot; series ) is reined_in , as if Itami is trying very hard to be thoughtful . That goes_against Itami ' s mischievous impulses , which tend to make a film like &quot; Tampopo &quot; such a hoot . &quot; The Funeral &quot; isn ' t as good ( or as extravagantly funny ) as what came later , but it ' s still witty and enjoyable . It ' s revealing too ; in fact , it may be one of Itami ' s most exploratory offerings . The world he looks_at is very small ( what happens when a hip couple must hold a funeral , old Japan-style ) , but with fine details . Sometimes they add_up in ho-hum ways , but mostly they ' re interesting as little documents of the Japanese culture . A familiar theme , one the new wing of Japanese filmmakers routinely turned_to in the ' 80s , is how the middle-class struggles to maintain traditions while devouring everything from the West , especially the United States . Itami uses a funeral as his whimsical centerpiece . All the events leading to the wake and actual funeral are highly idealized and marked by long-held customs , a fact that perplexes Wabisuke ( Tsutomu Yamazaki ) and Chizuko ( Nobuko Miyamoto ) , a prosperous young couple who must take_care of the remains of Chizuko ' s father . The ritual is precise and requires conformity , but the two are beleaguered by all sorts of questions . Where do you get a Shinto priest to say the correct prayers ? How much do you pay after he ' s found ? How do you arrange the ceremonial incense ? What do you say to mourners ? What about that symbolic gesture of hammering a nail in the coffin ? Do you bang it once , twice or three times ? Wabisuke and Chizuko even turn_to a self-help video , &quot; The ABCs of a Funeral , &quot; for advice . It ' s a giddy scene as they memorize just the right things to tell family and friends ; Chizuko , a practical wife if ever there was one , is relieved when she finds a brief platitude that the video ' s narrator assures will fit every occasion . &quot; Nice and short , &quot; Chizuko chirps . &quot; that ' s for me ! &quot; There are patches in &quot; The Funeral &quot; that drag_on , especially when Itami dwells on not-so-interesting characters , such_as a pal of Wabisuke ' s who wants to film the whole affair . But just when the movie ' s pace barely jogs , Itami tosses_in some dash , like the video scene or a touching speech by the dead man ' s wife ( Kin Sugai ) or the strange visit to a crematory . In that passage , an assistant suddenly confesses how he ' s plagued by nightmares of corpses coming_alive , just as the flames engulf them . But then he gathers himself and describes how babies have to be cremated gently , almost with an artist ' s touch . The scene isn ' t ghoulish at all ; it ' s oddly humane . * What : Juzo Itami ' s &quot; The Funeral. &quot; * When : Friday , April 15 , at 7 and 9 p.m. * Where : UC Irvine ' s Student_Center Crystal Cove Auditorium . * Whereabouts : Take the San Diego ( 405 ) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south to Campus Drive and take a left .
