   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : COLORADO ; A MILE HIGH , AND RISING ; AS DENVER REINVENTS ITSELF , IT ' S NOT ONLY THE CITY ' S SKYLINE that ' s CHANGING . NEW ATTRACTIONS ARE VYING WITH THE MOUNTAINS FOR VISITORS ' ATTENTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s a symphony night . The lights of the downtown skyline twinkle , the snow-blanketed Rockies stagger in the distance and subterranean metallic groans rise from the innards of the U.S. Mint in the heart of downtown . I sit a_few blocks away in Boettcher Concert_Hall , surrounded by the modern geometry of the Denver Performing Arts Complex , waiting . On the west edge of The Plex -- that ' s the local language -- Cherry Creek trickles in darkness and the city ' s foremost bicycle path , beside it , lies idle for a change . Two long blocks to the northeast , Denverites are settling_down to dinner in restaurants along the pedestrian 16th Street Mall , spine of downtown . Down in LoDo -- that ' s Lower Downtown -- the skeleton of a new baseball stadium is casting moon shadows on the surrounding scruffy neighborhood , and young folks are likely raising a din in a handful of brew pubs . Here in the hall , members of the Denver Brass and the Colorado Symphony Brass have finished with their Strauss and Gabrieli ; the Mussorgsky is yet to come . But hold_on . They ' ve announced an addition to the program . Here comes a man named Lou Malandra to the microphone . With a poem . It ' s his poem , and it ' s about . . . the new airport . &quot; Natives and Nomads , &quot; he intones . &quot; You who build these great white pyramid-like tents for the travelers of the world to gather / A paradise for people and planes / Carved by your mighty arm from out of the dust / Sweat and toil , your constant companions . . . &quot; It continues for more_than 100 lines , and Malandra , the poet_laureate of Denver International Airport , delivers them all_in a clear , loud voice . There ' s applause , and intermission , and Mussorgsky . Finally we all file_out into the cold night , and I wander toward my hotel through downtown Denver and its various improvements-in-progress , trying to superimpose this experience on another American big city . A paean to JFK airport at New York ' s Carnegie Hall ? Variations on a theme of public_library renovation at the Los Angeles Music Center ? A BART overture at the San Francisco Opera_House ? Maybe the difference is that those other cities have irretrievably settled into their identities , while Denver remains raw-boned and unfinished , self-conscious , boosterish , still a sort of frontier town after 135 years . Or maybe I just wandered into Boettcher Concert_Hall on an odd night when I visited last April . This much , anyway , is true : Denver is revising itself , amid large and unexpected obstacles . Most obviously , there is that enormous -- and enormously late -- new airport on the edge of town . ( See accompanying box , right. ) There is the city ' s recently arrived baseball franchise , the Rockies , which inspired spectacular fan support last year in its first season , then tested fans ' patience by falling_into strike idleness this year along with the rest of the major_leagues . In 1995 , 50 # 000-seat Coors Field is scheduled to open in Lower Downtown , setting_in_motion a scramble toward gentrification in a neighborhood with more_than a_few homeless in its alleys . There is the relocation of Elitch Gardens , an amusement_park that next year will move its gardens , fountains and rides from a 104-year-old , 29-acre site in northwest Denver to a 58-acre space on the edge of downtown . City officials have also thrown their weight behind a $ 116 million cross-town light rail system , scheduled to open Oct . 7 , despite public_opinion that is divided , at best . Nobody ' s blocking the ski slopes , anyway . Within a short westward drive or commuter flight ( more feasible in winter ) stand some of the world ' s most popular ski resorts , which become a major Denver preoccupation as fall edges toward winter . Vail , 119 miles west of the new airport , drew more_than 1.5 million skiers during the 1993-94 season . Breckenridge , 101 miles out , drew 1.2 million . Keystone ( 91 miles ) , Steamboat Springs ( 173 miles ) and Winter Park ( 99 miles ) , each drew more_than a_million . Snow willing , the skiing can be relied_upon . Still , any traveler who lands here these days is bound to be surprised one way or another , and probably none will be more surprised than those who thought they already knew the place . Denver began in 1859 , after a_few glinting flakes of gold turned_up at the confluence of the South_Platte_River and Cherry Creek . Enduring the usual challenges of fortune-hunting settlers in the West -- floods , fires , battles with the natives -- Denver ' s pioneers assembled a boom_town . By the turn_of_the_century , it was_full of Victorian_architecture and acclaimed a sophisticated city . These days the city ' s population is about 470 # 000 , with another 1.4 million in surrounding counties , and the boom-and-bust cycles continue : After exploding with development a decade ago , the city slumped severely in the late 1980s , and began another recovery a_few years ago , accompanied by the now-predictable arrival of fleeing Angelenos and attendant worries about inflated real_estate prices . I arrived on the last_day of March and stayed four nights at the Brown Palace Hotel , an 1892 stone Victorian triangle of a building at Broadway and Tremont Place . It has fancy stonework , a pricey restaurant and elaborate cast-iron railings surrounding an atrium nine stories high . My room -- $ 95 a night under a spring weekend special -- overlooked another reminder of turn-of-the-century Denver , the Navarre Building . Over its first 90 years , the three-story building held a boarding house , a gambling_den , a bordello and a restaurant . Since 1983 , it has held the Museum of Western Art and a collection of bronzes and landscapes by Albert Bierstadt , Charles Russell , Frederic Remington , Georgia O ' Keeffe , Norman Rockwell and others . But step_down to the basement level , and you ' re transported to bordello days : You see the remnants of a passage that ran under the street 100 years ago , which was purportedly used by prosperous hotel guests seeking secret egress and entrance into the brothel . If you ' re downtown and have time to see only one museum in town , however , that one should be the Denver Art Museum . The building itself is a 10-story shell that resembles a medieval castle redesigned by George Jetson . Inside , it houses one of the world ' s finest collections of Native_American artwork and artifacts , and displays it boldly and provocatively . After wandering through hundreds of pre-Columbian sculptures there , and then scores of woodwork samples from the 19th Century , and then various 20th-Century displays , I found myself facing a brightly colored Warholesque image of John Wayne ' s face next to a quotation . The work , part of a temporary exhibit since dismantled , was titled &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; and was made in 1992 by a Tlingit named Jesse Cooday . The image was fairly striking , but the artist ' s point lay_in the accompanying quotation attributed to Wayne : &quot; I don ' t feel we did them wrong in taking this great country from them . There were great numbers of people who needed new land and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves. &quot; Two long blocks from the art museum stands Colorado ' s state Capitol building . The golden-domed structure dominates downtown , its halls full of marble and murals and , on the day I looked in , time-killing legislators . Though Colorado ' s legislature is in session only 120 days a year , these lawmakers were between meetings , and several of them had gathered around a piano in a corner of the paperwork-strewn meeting room to sing &quot; Sentimental Journey &quot; and &quot; Has Anybody Seen My Gal ? &quot; Upstairs , there was a free observation deck with broad views . Outside , a plaque set into the Capitol steps indicated which step was precisely 5 # 280 feet above sea_level -- that is , a mile high . ( State politics , at least on the subject of sexual orientation , are more tranquil now than they were a year ago . Amendment 2 , the ballot measure blocking city and state officials from making laws to protect homosexuals from discrimination , was approved by voters statewide in late 1992 . But in December of last year , it was declared unconstitutional by a Denver District Court judge , effectively ending a nationwide campaign to boycott Colorado as a vacation destination. ) The U.S. Mint , at 320 W . Colfax Ave . and Delaware Street , presses_out more_than 5 billion coins yearly , stores gold bullion , stocks rare coins in its gift_shop and issues those strange subterranean groans . ( Free tours are available from 8 a.m.-2:45 p.m. on weekdays . Local tel . 844-3582. ) For shoppers , there ' s Larimer Square , a dolled-up historic preservation project with restaurants , nightclubs , art_galleries and boutiques in handsome , 12-year-old buildings of two and three stories . A block away , on 16th Street , stands The Shops_at Tabor Center , a glass-enclosed mall with 80 resident stores and restaurants . The city ' s biggest and most upscale mall , the 140-store Cherry Creek Shopping_Center , is in an affluent and very walkable neighborhood a_few miles southwest of downtown and is neighbored by The Tattered Cover , one of the largest independent bookstores in the nation . For students of history , the Molly Brown House at 1340 Pennsylvania on Capitol_Hill , shows_off its 1889 stonework and exhibits inside tell the tale of the Denver woman whose &quot; unsinkability &quot; in the Titanic disaster inspired a Broadway musical and a film ( tel . 832-4092 ) . Across town in the down-at-the-heels Five Points area , the Black American West Museum at 3091 California St . is open Wednesday through Sunday and devoted to the story of the African American cowboy ( tel . 292-2566 ) . For cyclists , the most prominent among scores of paths are the five-mile-long Cherry Creek Bike Path and the 12-mile-long Platte_River Greenway , which intersect at Confluence Park near downtown . One place to rent a bike is The Bike Broker at 1440 Market St. , where Ken Whelpdale at the counter quoted me rates of $ 15 for a half-day , $ 20 for a full day and $ 25 for a 24-hour period . Should anyone need to consult Whelpdale directly , he gives his official title as &quot; head road-bike geek. &quot; The city has always been an ardent sports town , heartily backing the Broncos and the Nuggets , and patronizing a sporting goods store -- Gart Bros. , at 10th and Broadway , downtown -- said to be the largest in the world . Sooner or later a Denver visitor runs_into the original Rockies , jagged with boulders and white with snow . Climb the 93 steps to the Capitol building observation deck , look_to the west and there they lie , beyond the ambitious columns of City_Hall and the sharp-angled walls of the Denver Museum of Art -- and on the other side , it must be said , of some serious big-city smog . More_than 50 peaks in Colorado rise above 14 # 000 feet , and at least three are visible from the Capitol . ( There ' s another broad view from the hilltop grass rectangle of Cranmer Park at First Avenue and Bel Aire Street , where a_horizon map labels the most notable peaks. ) Many Denverites say they enjoy the place most not for itself , but for the access it gives them to the mountains for skiing , hiking , camping , mountain-biking . For those so inclined , there is also drinking ( The Coors brewery , which offers free tours , is in Golden , 12 miles to the west ) and casino gambling in the old mining towns of Central_City and Blackhawk ( 35 miles west of Denver ) . There ' s even prospecting . One morning on an aimless drive near Golden , I pulled_off the highway at a riverside view point , and saw below an expressionless man with a pan , silently sifting dirt from the stream . If he was having any luck , he wasn ' t saying . Most of my mountain experience came from an afternoon and evening around Boulder , 30 miles northwest of downtown Denver . There the air is cleaner , the real_estate costlier , the panhandlers rarer . The University of Colorado dominates town , and the local population is young , tanned and heavily equipped with in-line skates , bicycles and other implements of outdoor_sport . On the way to a late lunch , I was button-holed by a young_man pushing a petition to legalize marijuana , and even he looked clean-cut and athletic enough to pass for an Air_Force cadet on holiday from Colorado Springs . From lunch , a friend and I zoomed out of town along Boulder Creek and into Roosevelt National Forest , with evergreen slopes and stone-walled cabins flashing by , a barn decorated with antlers and then a half-frozen reservoir , which a single fisherman had to himself . All this about an hour from downtown Denver . &quot; Even in the worst of times , Colorado ' s not a bad place to be . You ' ve got the mountains , and they ' re free , &quot; Tom Smart , a 51-year-old Denver native , told me the next day . &quot; We probably go every_other weekend to bike , hike or climb. &quot; Over the last few years , Smart said , he and his wife , Suzy Thevenet , have together climbed more_than a dozen of the state ' s 14 # 000-foot mountains . You know , he said , there are more_than 50 of them in the state . I told him I ' d heard that . When we finished chatting , Smart and Thevenet strapped on their helmets , climbed back onto their bicycles and pedaled out of Larimer Square for the home stretch of the day ' s casual 20-mile ride .
