   <TEXT> President Clinton on Saturday stepped_up efforts to increase diplomatic pressure on North_Korea , calling it &quot; virtually imperative &quot; that the world community impose economic sanctions on Asia ' s nuclear renegade . With British Prime_Minister John Major by his side during a D-day appearance in Portsmouth , England , Clinton sought to quell talk_of armed conflict , saying sanctions would be &quot; clearly . . . not an act of war and should not be seen as such. &quot; But North_Korea ' s ambassador in Beijing , Chu Chang Jun , repeated warnings Saturday that &quot; any kind of economic sanctions &quot; against North_Korea would be regarded_as &quot; a declaration of war. &quot; In Washington , the United States , Japan and South_Korea issued a unified call_for economic sanctions after recent indications that North_Korea may be concealing production of nuclear_weapons . The allies ended two days of talks Saturday , warning of &quot; a serious situation on the North_Korean peninsula , &quot; caused by Pyongyang ' s efforts to thwart inspections designed to determine how much plutonium North_Korea possesses . Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci , flanked by a South_Korean special ambassador and a senior official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry , said the three countries agreed that the U.N. Security_Council must &quot; urgently consider an appropriate response , including sanctions , &quot; to bring North_Korea to heel . In Seoul , South_Korean government officials met in an emergency session Saturday and set_up a task_force to assess national military readiness . President Kim Young Sam told reporters that U.S. and South_Korean forces &quot; are keeping a round-the-clock surveillance on the North ' s ( military ) movements , &quot; and he added that the two allies &quot; are fully prepared and have enough military power ready to meet any emergencies. &quot; The United States has about 36 # 000 troops and an array of sophisticated weaponry , including Patriot antimissile batteries , stationed in South_Korea . The latest swirl of rhetoric and diplomacy came two days after the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Hans Blix , told members of the Security_Council that North_Korea had shifted spent fuel rods inside its principal nuclear_reactor in ways that would obscure any efforts to divert plutonium to manufacture nuclear bombs . The revelation deepened suspicions about North_Korea ' s nuclear intentions and added urgency to international efforts aimed at halting the nation ' s nuclear program . North_Korea maintains that its nuclear_energy facilities have not been used to make weapons . Clinton_Administration officials have said that in light of Blix ' s testimony , Pyongyang should allow IAEA inspectors to take samples and measurements at the nation ' s two major radioactive waste sites . That would give inspectors an alternative to analyzing spent fuel rods as a means of accounting_for North_Korea ' s weapons-grade plutonium . &quot; All we want them to do is keep their word , &quot; Clinton said Saturday . &quot; There ' s still time for North_Korea to avoid sanctions actually taking_effect . . . but this is in their hands. &quot; Washington hopes to escalate pressure gradually to persuade North_Korea to let inspectors in . If Pyongyang still refuses to yield after an initial tightening of trade , the allies would press for a freeze on North_Korea ' s financial transactions and , finally , for a cutoff of oil and food supplies , diplomats said . Clinton_Administration officials acknowledged Saturday that negotiating a sanctions strategy that would both pinch North_Korea and win the support of reluctant allies has proven a difficult and delicate task . In an effort to win international backing for sanctions , the United States has pressed high-level contacts with Russia , as well as with China . Either country could veto any bid to impose sanctions on North_Korea . Both have been reluctant to go_along with sanctions until further diplomacy has been tried . But Clinton_Administration officials said they have begun to see signs of greater flexibility from both countries . South_Korea reportedly is using diplomatic channels to try to persuade China , North_Korea ' s last major ally , to support sanctions . China , meanwhile , has been trying to influence North_Korea to make concessions that would avoid sanctions . On Friday , a Chinese-backed newspaper in Hong Kong said China would stop food and fuel exports to North_Korea in the event of sanctions . The Security_Council may take_up the sanctions matter this week . But Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has been pressing for a separate meeting , outside the Security_Council forum , on the situation , and U.S. officials said such a huddle could &quot; still be useful at some point. &quot; A senior U.S. official said Clinton and Yeltsin agreed that Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev will get_in_touch to discuss &quot; the issues involved in holding such a meeting. &quot;</TEXT>
