   <HEADLINE> BEYOND VIETNAM : USING FORCE IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Bill_Clinton , in step with his NATO colleagues , is feeling his way forward in Bosnia . Despite the successful use of a North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ultimatum to bring Sarajevo back to life , the decision to attempt to relieve the siege of Gorazde by bombing Serb positions came reluctantly . Constraining Clinton was not just fear of Serb reprisals against U.N. forces in Bosnia and concern about Russia ' s reaction , but the still-powerful lessons of Vietnam -- lessons that have for two decades sternly cautioned successive U.S. Administrations against entanglement in regional wars . By using military power to protect threatened towns in Bosnia , Clinton is not only stemming ethnic cleansing and prodding the parties toward a peace settlement ; he is also challenging reigning paradigms about when and how the United States should use force . Moving beyond the obsolete and inappropriate lessons drawn from Vietnam is essential if the United States is to make the transition from Cold_War superpower to leader and catalyst of collective action in an uncertain post-Cold War world . Comparing Bosnia with Vietnam is wrongheaded for two reasons . First , America ' s war in Vietnam occurred during the height of the Cold_War , whereas the conflict in Bosnia is a product of the Cold_War ' s end . In Vietnam , U.S. forces faced an adversary backed by one of the world ' s two superpowers . North Vietnam had access to a sizable arsenal of sophisticated weaponry ; shutting_down its military machine was virtually impossible . In contrast , the Bosnian Serbs do not enjoy an unlimited supply of outside goodwill and resources . To be sure , Serbia provides military support . But sanctions continue to erode the Serbian economy . If NATO chose to attack oil depots and supply_lines , it could seriously impair Serb military operations . Support from Russia has come only in the form of Boris N . Yeltsin ' s rancor over not being consulted before NATO bombed Serb positions around Gorazde . Unlike the North Vietnamese , the Serbs can be politically and militarily isolated . That the war in Bosnia takes_place outside the context of the Cold_War also means the United States and its allies will find it easier to limit their involvement . What lured U.S. soldiers deep into the jungles of Southeast_Asia was the global battle against communism . U.S. decision-makers sincerely believed that at stake in Vietnam was the credibility of the West ' s commitment to stem the spread of communism and defend democracy . With East-West rivalry now a historical artifact , the war in Bosnia takes_on far different dimensions . Clinton has justifiably argued that important U.S. interests are at stake : preventing the war from spreading , adapting NATO to new post-Cold War missions and stopping the humanitarian tragedy . These interests warrant limited U.S. engagement . But without the Cold_War overlay , U.S. interests will not expand as they did_in Southeast_Asia -- the scope of U.S. engagement can be limited accordingly . In the post-Cold War era , the United States will engage gingerly in foreign conflicts precisely because it can afford to do so . Without the threat of Soviet aggression , most regional conflicts will not threaten vital U.S. interests . The principal risk -- as revealed in Bosnia -- is that of doing too_little , not too_much , of shrinking_from international responsibilities and missing low-cost opportunities to contain conflicts before they spread , not of being drawn into quagmires . The Vietnam analogy is misguided for a second reason : Specific military lessons are being misconstrued and applied inappropriately to Bosnia . U.S. military commanders withdrew from Vietnam smarting from the political restrictions that limited their conduct of the war . Since then , the Pentagon has adopted an all-or-nothing attitude : When America goes_to_war , it will do so with overwhelming force . A massive assault on an Iraqi army exposed on a desert is fine ; limited air_attacks on Serb positions in the mountains of Bosnia are not . This argument , however , fails to take into consideration the overall objective of using force . If the objective is complete defeat of the adversary , then overwhelming force makes_sense . But if the objective is limited -- as in Bosnia -- then the means should be limited as well . The goal of NATO air strikes is to stop the Bosnian Serbs from besieging Muslim enclaves and to facilitate the peace process , not to destroy the Serb army . To attain these goals , limited force is appropriate . Critics of U.S. engagement in Bosnia misuse another lesson of Vietnam : that air_power is not an effective military instrument . It is true that air_power alone does not win wars . U.S. bombers pounded North Vietnam , as well as the supply_lines running south , with little effect on North Vietnam ' s determination or its ability to resupply its troops . Similarly , repeated air_attacks on Iraqi forces in Kuwait took their toll , but did not induce Iraq to withdraw ; it took ground forces to do that . But again , this argument ignores ends and therefore reaches misguided conclusions about means . Air_power could not bring the Serbs to their knees , but it is not intended to . NATO is attacking Serb positions as a key element of coercive diplomacy ; air strikes seek to make the costs of besieging Muslim towns outweigh the benefits . As such , air_power is an effective tool . In deciding whether to defend Gorazde and other towns with air_power , the appropriate model is Sarajevo , not Vietnam . The residents of Sarajevo have emerged from their basements for one simple reason : The Serbs withdrew their guns from the surrounding hills when faced with the prospect of air_attacks . Opponents of U.S. involvement in Bosnia misuse one other lesson from Vietnam . Vietnam , they argue , demonstrated that civil_wars are quagmires . Especially in the Balkans , where ethnic hatreds run deep , the argument goes , the United States is poised to find itself in the middle of a protracted and futile battle . The mistake in Vietnam was not that the United States got involved , but that U.S. involvement escalated to a_level far beyond what interests at stake warranted . Accordingly , the challenge in Bosnia is not to avoid involvement , but to ensure that the level of U.S. engagement remains proportional to the interests at stake . Determining what level of engagement corresponds to these interests is inherently subjective . Sensibly , the Clinton_Administration has drawn_the_line at the use of air_power and committed itself to send_in ground troops only after the warring parties have reached a peace settlement . At least for now , the key questions will focus_on whether NATO protection should be extended_to all designated safe areas in Bosnia and whether bombing should intensify if the Serbs continue their strangulation of Muslim villages . NATO should now focus_on building momentum behind the peace process . Serbs must be told , unequivocally , that attacks on safe areas will not be tolerated . Efforts to besiege Muslim enclaves should be countered with explicit warnings about air strikes , followed by those strikes if Serb forces refuse to withdraw . If limited strikes do not succeed in moderating Serb behavior -- as appears to be the case in Gorazde -- the targets should be expanded to include communications facilities , command_posts and logistical infrastructure . The more costly it is for the Serbs to continue fighting , the more attractive a settlement will become . There is no guarantee that this effort to back_up diplomacy with military_force and coerce the Serbs to the negotiating table will work . But it is worth trying . If it succeeds , not only will peace return to the Balkans , but Bosnia will help U.S. decision-makers look past the obsolete lessons of Vietnam . In an era when Europe ' s stability is likely to be threatened by small wars and ethnic strife , the preventive deployment of troops , peacekeeping operations and coercive diplomacy -- not all-out war -- will be the order_of_the_day . Rethinking when and how the United States should use force is central to sustaining U.S. leadership and preparing the country for a new strategic landscape. *</TEXT>
