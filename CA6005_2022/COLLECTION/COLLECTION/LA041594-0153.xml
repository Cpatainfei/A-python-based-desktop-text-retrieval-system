   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE SEEKS ALTERNATIVES TO KILLING PIGEONS ; ANIMALS : BIRDS ARE A NUISANCE TO DOWNTOWN BUSINESSES . BUT MANY CITIZENS REACT ANGRILY TO EUTHANASIA PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two days after voting to stem the city ' s burgeoning pigeon population by trapping and killing the birds through methods that include carbon_monoxide_poisoning , Glendale officials Thursday said they are considering more humane ways to rid the downtown area of the pesky fowl . City officials said they were deluged with calls from angry residents and animal-rights activists after Tuesday ' s unanimous vote to catch and euthanize hundreds of the prolific birds , and now consider euthanasia as &quot; a last resort. &quot; Instead , they said they are looking_at non-lethal ways to curb the population , such_as repellents , netting or plastic owls or falcons , which are supposed to scare the birds away . &quot; There were no alternatives presented to us in the first place because we were contracting with the county and the county said euthanasia was the only way to do_it , &quot; said Councilman Larry Zarian . Tuesday ' s vote followed merchant complaints that pigeons had overtaken downtown office_buildings and outdoor restaurants , dirtying awnings , ledges and benches and ruining the Civic Center ' s appearance . Officials also voiced concern about diseases transmitted via pigeon droppings -- notably salmonella and tuberculosis . Glendale , which would have contracted with Los Angeles County to trap and kill the birds , was the first city in the county to adopt such a sweeping pigeon-eradication measure . Outraged residents and animal-rights groups loudly protested when county officials disclosed that they would kill pigeons through carbon-monoxide poisoning by putting them in a bag and tying it to the tailpipe of a running vehicle . &quot; There are all kinds of impurities in vehicle exhaust that can burn their eyes and destroy their mucous_membranes , &quot; said Leslie Press , a biologist with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in Washington . Press said that while the carbon-monoxide poisoning method is inhumane , it ' s not uncommon and is used by companies around the nation to control pigeon populations . However , she added , lethal methods do not work because they do not ensure that other pigeons won ' t return to roost in the area . Richard Wightman , the county ' s deputy agricultural commissioner , said the carbon-monoxide method &quot; has not been a common practice and it ' s not an old practice . We have simply used it several times when we needed an expedient way to get_rid_of birds . &quot; We had used carbon_monoxide for jobs at smaller buildings , but not on any larger scale like the Glendale job would be , &quot; Wightman said . He said the county is studying the use of lethal injection to control pigeon populations . The county Department of Animal Control would perform this procedure , which involves injecting each bird with a barbiturate that would put it to sleep_in seconds . Representatives of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Los Angeles said the group does not approve of the carbon-monoxide method but euthanasia by lethal injection is acceptable . At the Glendale council ' s request , the city_manager ' s office is drafting a report on alternative methods to rid the city ' s Civic Center of pigeons . &quot; Because people have been calling and protesting our decision , we decided to get more information on alternatives to deter the pigeons , &quot; Zarian said . City_Manager David Ramsay said the report will include residents ' ideas on how to control the city ' s pigeon population . Residents interested in providing advice to the city can write to City_Hall at 613 Broadway . City staff will research each idea for its viability before placing it in the report , Ramsay said . Across the nation , cities have adopted methods other_than euthanasia to control pigeons after residents and animal-rights groups complained about the method , which they termed cruel and unnecessary . In the early 1970s , San Francisco trapped hundreds of the determined birds , shipped them 100 miles north and let them go , said Carl Friedman , director of the San Francisco Department for Animal Care and Control . The effort backfired because birds died in holding cages and others were said to have returned to the city , Friedman said . San Francisco has since enacted laws against trapping , releasing and killing the birds and also prohibits feeding the fowl in any but nine designated areas in the city . Administrators in New York and Washington have contracted with a Boston firm , BirdMaster , to &quot; bird-proof &quot; theaters , hotels and government buildings . BirdMaster draped a 30- by 45-foot net , guaranteed to last for the life of the structure , over the facade of the Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation building to prevent pigeons from landing , said the company ' s John Pace . The netting , invisible from a distance , also has been hung_on the Lincoln Memorial , the Department_of_Agriculture and the Justice_Department . San Diego reduced the pigeon population in Balboa Park from 8 # 000 to 1 # 000 by spiking pigeon corn feed with a birth-control substance . San Clemente used a similar method to slow population increases in a flock inhabiting the pier . St . Louis officials installed six loudspeakers in the University City soccer facility to scare_away the birds with ultrasonic waves -- which are inaudible to people but supposedly annoy birds and drive them away . But some Glendale officials are leery of how effective some alternatives would be in driving the birds away . &quot; Some of the suggestions only move birds from one place to another . We need a more permanent solution , &quot; said Mayor Eileen Givens . * ON THE ISSUE : Should communities attempt to reduce their pigeon populations by killing the birds ? B2</TEXT>
