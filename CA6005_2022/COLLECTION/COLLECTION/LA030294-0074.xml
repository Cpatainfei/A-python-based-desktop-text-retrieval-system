   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; POLITICALLY CORRECT KUNG FU IN ' SON '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First &quot; On Deadly Ground , &quot; and now the TV movie &quot; Vanishing Son &quot; -- it ' s not often that we get two politically correct kung_fu features in nearly the same week . &quot; Vanishing Son &quot; ( at 8 tonight on KTLA-TV Channel 5 ) handily allows you to feel bad for the plight of the immigrant , then to cheer as anyone who stands_in the way of the immigrant gets hurt bad . In the non-martial arts , that ' s what they call a contrived double-whammy . Russell Wong ( the abusive husband in &quot; The Joy Luck Club &quot; ) and Chi Muoi Lo star as diametrically opposed Chinese brothers -- one ' s Goofus , the other ' s Gallant -- whose lives take very different paths once they smuggle themselves into America . Well , not so totally different . Both come equipped with fists -- and feet -- of fury , and use them to escape being set_upon by predators , which , fortunately , occurs at about 15-minute intervals . Trapped by Chinese soldiers during a Tian An Men Square-type protest , they kick their way_out . Cornered stateside by jail mates , creditors or gangsters , they kick their way_out . Disagreeing on employment opportunities -- sensible Wong wants to stay straight , while hot-head Lo goes_for the gangsta plan -- they kick the hell out of each other . Imagine Bruce Lee starring in &quot; Combination Platter &quot; and you ' ll have the idea . At least &quot; Vanishing Son &quot; has its heart in the right place , redressing a minor historical grievance . After directing &quot; Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story , &quot; which touched_on the fact that the old series &quot; Kung Fu &quot; was originally designed for Lee , filmmaker Rob Cohen wanted to create a new show that would actually cast Asian Americans as Asians . &quot; Son &quot; is it , with three more installments scheduled to follow tonight ' s two-hour pilot ( written and executive produced by Cohen , directed by John Nicolella ) . Wong is handsome and limber enough , and Lo has some nice moments in the late going , crying over his life-long jealousy . But between the &quot; Fingers &quot; -like subplot -- in which Wong instantly gets a gig as a concert violinist ( if only he can protect his pinkies ! ) and romances the babe in the adjoining chair , all_the post- &quot; Godfather &quot; juxtaposed-brothers stuff and token contemporary asides -- like the gay character who speaks_up only to inform the audience he ' s a gay character -- &quot; Son &quot; doesn ' t take long to kick_up some camp . Look_on the bright_side , fu fans : The fight scenes are fun , and there ' s no David Carradine around to preach pseudo-pacifism . CHRIS WILLMAN</TEXT>
