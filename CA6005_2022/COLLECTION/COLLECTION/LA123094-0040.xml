   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE / CANCER RESEARCH ; PROGRESS CITED IN CUTTING OFF BLOOD TO TUMORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists Thursday reported progress in cutting_off blood supply to a wide variety of tumors in laboratory animals , a finding that could lead to new ways of making human cancers shrink and disappear . &quot; We don ' t want to oversell this -- we ' re not saying we have the magic_bullet , there ' s a lot more research to be done . But so far , we have green_lights , &quot; said Dr. David A . Cheresh , one of the lead scientists on the project at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla . The research by Cheresh and Scripps colleague Peter Brooks is being published in today ' s edition of the journal Cell . The Scripps team was able to block growth of new blood_vessels that feed tumors without causing any damage to blood_vessels in normal healthy tissue in laboratory animals . They accomplished this with a single injection of a monoclonal_antibody named LM609 or with a small synthetic peptide . Without a blood supply , the tumor shrinks and vanishes . The team got encouraging results in an array of solid tumors -- including lung , colon , breast and brain cancers . &quot; The antibody tricks these newly forming vessels into self-destruction , or programmed cell death , by interfering with their survival signal , &quot; Cheresh said . &quot; When the signal is blocked , the cells think they are in the wrong place and commit suicide. &quot; Though Cheresh is excited about his findings and believes that they hold promise , he stressed that approaches that work well in laboratories can turn_out to be disappointments in human trials . Studies will have to be completed on the antibody ' s toxicity or possible harmful side_effects in humans before clinical trials can start , probably in about 18 months . It is customary for the first human trials to involve severely ill people , whose cancer is advanced and who have not responded to other treatments . But the research with chicken embryos , described in Cell , as well as more recent studies on laboratory mice , has been very encouraging , Cheresh told Reuters in an interview . &quot; It ' s having an exciting and powerful impact on cancer , &quot; he said . The Scripps team used human tumor fragments placed in chicken embryos . Within a_few hours , the pieces of tumor began attracting new blood_vessels , just as they would in human_beings . Within 24 hours , they were injected with the antibody or with a control antibody . In those injected with LM609 , the blood_vessels to the tumors shrank and disappeared in the pancreas , breast , brain , lung and larynx . Normal blood_vessels were unaffected . And once the tumor vanished , the chicken embryos developed normally . In those with the control substance , the blood_vessels proliferated and the tumors thrived . Earlier attempts to starve tumors have failed because cancer can use more_than one method to grow blood_vessels . Experts hope that the new approach interferes with a process that is essential to all these methods of growth . Dr. Judah Folkman , a pioneer in the study of cancer blood supply , called the Scripps work &quot; a remarkable achievement. &quot; In a related study , still in_progress , the LM609 injection also shows promise in treating eye_disease , including macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy , which are caused when new blood_vessels form in the back of the eye . Both diseases can cause blindness . A San Diego-based company , Ixsys Inc. , has licensed the LM609 antibody and has created a humanized form of it . The goal is to begin clinical trials within the next 18 months , first for cancer and then for eye_disease , Cheresh said . Further down the road , the approach may also hold promise for treating various inflammatory_diseases , such_as rheumatoid_arthritis , that also prompt the body to grow new blood_vessels .</TEXT>
