   <HEADLINE> ' SPECIALIST , ' ' PULP ' DUKE IT OUT OVER NO . 1 SPOT ; BOX_OFFICE : DISTRIBUTORS BATTLE OVER WEEKEND GROSS ESTIMATES FOR THE HEAVILY ADVERTISED FILMS . ' WES CRAVEN ' S NEW NIGHTMARE ' TAKES THIRD PLACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Depending_on whose version proves accurate , Quentin Tarantino ' s new film , &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; starring John Travolta and Bruce Willis , was either the weekend ' s top-grossing film or the runner-up . On Sunday , Miramax , which released the film , was engaged in a my-gross-is-bigger-than-yours contest with Warner Bros . The latter distributor claimed its movie , &quot; The Specialist , &quot; starring Sylvester Stallone , was outselling &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and was still No . 1 in its second weekend . Most estimates had the Miramax release taking_in $ 8.4 million to $ 8.6 million . But Miramax was claiming $ 9.16 million on 1 # 338 screens . The lower figures for &quot; Pulp &quot; supposedly didn ' t include 72 theaters , mostly in Canada , that Miramax had neglected to mention earlier . An oversight , said Bob Weinstein , who along with his brother Harvey , runs Miramax . That led Warner distribution chief Barry Reardon to respond , &quot; Give me a break &quot; and to increase his &quot; official &quot; $ 8.9-million estimate for &quot; The Specialist &quot; to an unofficial $ 9.3 million to $ 9.4 million . Weekend figures released Sunday are imprecise estimates made while box_offices are still open , but are based on typical ticket-sale patterns . John Krier of Exhibitor Relations , Inc. , a firm that tracks box-office performance , expressed skepticism about Miramax ' s figures . But Weinstein stood_firm , saying , &quot; Anybody is welcome to come_in here and check it out if they like. &quot; What is beyond dispute is that Miramax and Warner Bros . both advertised heavily to attract weekend audiences . Miramax competitors are claiming that the company spent well in excess of the $ 5 million reported to open the film . &quot; In that ballpark &quot; was as specific as Weinstein was willing to get . Regardless of the final gross , the Tarantino film ' s debut was notable in that it indicated break-out potential for the $ 8-million production . According to industry sources , &quot; Pulp &quot; performed well in all markets save for small cities . However , business was up only 27 % from Friday to Saturday ( box-office grosses can rise as much as 50 % on a second day ) simply because most houses were sold_out , Weinstein said . But one competitor said &quot; Pulp &quot; was flat from Friday to Saturday . The true test will be whether the film has enough pulp to sustain by word_of_mouth after the costly opening-week ad_blitz . Coupled with the more_than palatable opening performance of another independently made film , New Line ' s &quot; Wes Craven ' s New Nightmare &quot; which grossed about $ 7.1 million on 1 # 850 screens ( and finished in third place ) , the major studios got a little run_for their box-office share over the past weekend . ( The term &quot; independent &quot; is a loose one . Miramax is owned by Disney , New Line by Ted Turner ) . Considering that it ' s the seventh installment in the &quot; Nightmare &quot; series , that was a pretty good showing , said Mitch Goldman , New Line ' s president of marketing and distribution . Overall , business for the weekend was no better and no worse than last year . Regardless of its box-office standing , &quot; The Specialist &quot; dropped more_than 30 % from its $ 14-million opening plateau with the added competition of &quot; Pulp &quot; and &quot; Nightmare. &quot; Other weekend openings were less notable . The kid comedy &quot; Little Giants &quot; wasn ' t gigantic with about $ 5.4 million on more_than 2 # 000 screens . Savoy Pictures ' &quot; Exit to Eden &quot; was out the door with little more_than $ 3 million in 1 # 670 theaters . The likable &quot; I Like It Like That &quot; surfaced in 55 theaters with little hoopla ( but some decent reviews ) . It was not enough to lift it past $ 250 # 000 . The new version of &quot; The Browning Version &quot; played old with only $ 44 # 000 on 12 screens . Among the returning films , &quot; The River Wild &quot; drew $ 5.5 million in its third weekend . &quot; Only You &quot; got_in an acceptable second weekend of $ 4.3 million and has grossed almost $ 12 million in 10 days . And the indomitable &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; just keeps rollin ' along . The year ' s top-grossing film should also be one of the best fall performers with $ 3.3 million over the weekend for seventh place and $ 280 million to date . Ninth was &quot; The Shawshank Redemption &quot; with $ 2.5 million , and 10th was &quot; Quiz Show &quot; with $ 2.3 million .</TEXT>
