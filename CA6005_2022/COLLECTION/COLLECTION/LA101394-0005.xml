   <HEADLINE> GRILLING ON THE RIM ; BARBECUE : THE ASIAN PALETTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Grilling -- all year long it ' s a great way to cook . When the sun sets early , turn_on the lights . Too cold ? Bundle_up . Rain ? A determined griller carries_on somehow . I ' m thinking_of the street vendor in Krabi , a town in southern Thailand , who turned_out succulent meat on a stick even when his grill-cart was veiled with drizzle from a passing monsoon . In America , the barbecue is an appliance of choice . In Asia , it can be an appliance of necessity . Third-World homes are not necessarily equipped with a range , or even a kitchen as we know it . A grill may be the only way to cook . Then too , Asian grills can fill a room with strong aromas and smoke from the high heat required for stir-frying . Consequently , some of the wealthy have two kitchens , one for general cooking and a breezy , open area for grilling and wok dishes . Five-star restaurants may have the same arrangement . In Bangkok , one eatery popular_with farangs ( foreigners ) provides air-conditioned luxury up front . Orders for sate , though , are not cooked in the large , well-equipped kitchen but on a charcoal grill out back under an umbrella . * Grilling is so prevalent in Bangkok that it seems the pollution there must have a strong charcoal element . Sidewalk vendors line busy streets barbecuing chicken , meat , squid , shrimp , fish_balls , sausages , ears of corn , bananas in the peel and more . In Indonesia , itinerant sate cooks carry grills balanced on shoulder poles . Unlike our round or large rectangular barbecues , the most efficient grill for sate is long and narrow , designed to hold the sticks_in a row . The ends of the skewers extend over the sides , making_it easy to turn them without getting burned . One thinks_of sate as chunks or slices of meat . But on Bali and adjacent Lombok Island , a popular variation is sate lilit -- ground meat on a stick . Actually , the meat is not ground but pounded in a mortar until the fibers break_down and the meat becomes soft enough to mold onto skewers . In the Balinese village of Kemenuh , cooking teacher Ibu Mas showed me how to do this . We cooked the sate on a tiny grill on the sidewalk outside the kitchen . Long enough to hold perhaps a dozen sticks , shallow enough to require little fuel ( Ibu used coconut husks ) , the grills cost only $ 1.50 at the local market . To obtain steady heat , cooks encourage the coals with whatever is handy -- a fan woven from palm fronds , a wooden board or a piece of cardboard . At outdoor hawker centers in Singapore , sate grillers sometimes use their fans to create showy bursts of flame -- an image so emblematic it ' s used in promoting tourism . * In the Philippines , gas_stoves are relatively new arrivals . Until then , the alternative was the barbecue , says Filipino food expert Joyce R . Lapus of Manila . What often turns_up on Philippine grills is bangus ( milkfish ) wrapped in banana leaves and topped with tomatoes , onion and a squeeze of calamansi juice . Lapus ' great-grandmother founded the Aristocrat , a restaurant in Manila famous for barbecued chicken and pork , and her grandmother is the Mama Sita whose name appears on a line of Filipino seasonings . Mama Sita ' s barbecue marinade is composed of soy_sauce , garlic , sugar and pepper . Add more sugar , and it will resemble the marinade used at the Aristocrat , Lapus promises . The truth is , the small , juicy chickens grilled at the Aristocrat are as important as the seasoning . In Asia , menus travel . For example , in northeastern Thailand , barbecued chicken is eaten with a spicy green papaya salad pounded in a mortar , called som tam , and glutinous rice . At the Aristocrat in Manila , barbecued chicken is served with a green papaya salad called atsara and java rice tinted orange with annatto . Both papaya salads have sweet-sour dressings . Because of their sunny climate , Filipinos have many opportunities to grill . But in a congested city such_as Tokyo , where winter can be harsh , outdoor cooking is impractical . The Japanese manage by using oven broilers and range-top grills , says Matao Uwate , a cooking teacher , cookbook writer , radio personality and champion of Japanese food in Los Angeles for more_than 40 years . Japanese markets here stock grills composed of a shallow pan with a grate on top . Small and easy to clean , they require little storage_space . * Some restaurants , such_as Nanbantei of Tokyo , specialize in grilling over charcoal -- not ordinary coals but bincho , a fine hardwood from Wakayama on the southern coast of Honshu . Bincho is expensive but burns for a long_time and provides intense , steady heat . Bincho is so prestigious that restaurants display a plaque to let customers know they use it . Such a plaque -- in Japanese -- is mounted on the tiled wall near the grill at Nanbantei ' s branch in L.A. ' s Little Tokyo . Similar wooden plaques list tidbits available from the grill : tsukune ( chicken meatballs ) , chicken_wings , asparagus wrapped in tissue-thin pork and slices of chicken_breast sandwiched with shiso leaves . Bottled Korean marinades , available in most Asian markets , have made Korean barbecue almost as familiar as teriyaki . Koreans may grill at_home but are more likely to go_to a restaurant , says Moon Sook Chung of Surabul restaurant in Los Angeles . Besides , it ' s fun to join in the cooking around the tabletop grills . Along with platters of marinated meat come rice , soup and many side_dishes -- salads , marinated vegetables , bits of seafood and one or more versions of the spicy pickle kimchi . Korean barbecued beef is_well known , but sweet-hot pork grilled until the edges turn crisp and caramelized is irresistable . Funny thing is , Koreans don ' t think highly of this dish . In Korea , pork costs much less than short ribs ( kalbi ) and is not regarded_as classy food , says Chung . Beef is seasoned with gentle respect , but pork is nearly overwhelmed by the fiercest seasonings : big spoonfuls of fiery chile powder , bean paste loaded with chile , and grated ginger root . To my way of thinking , this bolder treatment produces sublime results . * Kyung Lee , chef at Surabul Korean restaurant , says that for best flavor , the meat should marinate at least eight hours . SURABUL ' S BARBECUED PORK 1 cup soy_sauce 1 / 3 cup water 2 tablespoons chopped green_onions 2 tablespoons hot bean paste 2 tablespoons sesame_oil 1 1 / 2 tablespoons ground hot red_pepper 2 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon roasted sesame_seeds 1 teaspoon minced garlic 1 teaspoon minced ginger root 1 / 4 teaspoon white_pepper Dash MSG 1 3 / 4 pounds pork butt , thinly sliced 1 thick slice onion 4 to 5 green_onions , white part only , cut diagonally in 2- to 3-inch pieces In large bowl combine soy_sauce , water , green_onions , hot bean paste , sesame_oil , hot red_pepper , sugar , sesame_seeds , garlic , ginger , white_pepper and MSG .

Chotipanang pounds the fish to a paste in a mortar , then mixes it with pounded seasonings and bastes it with coconut_milk as it cooks on the grill . The Thai fish that he uses is not available here , but black cod worked well in a test of the recipe . The fish can be molded onto thick wooden chopsticks , available in any Asian market . BARBECUED FISH ON A STICK ( Jaeng-Lorn Ping ) 1 pound boneless , skinless fish , such_as black cod 3 small cloves garlic 2 Thai chiles 3 tablespoons minced shallot or onion_Salt Canned or thawed frozen coconut_milk Dipping Sauce Pound fish to paste in mortar .

At the Thai food festival in Beverly Hills in September , restaurant owner Ken Kittivech served the chicken with green papaya salad and sticky rice , traditional chicken companions from Northeastern Thailand . A sweet , hot dip loaded with garlic adds wonderful , intense flavor . CHAN DARA ' S BARBECUED CHICKEN 1 cup coconut_milk 1 / 4 cup fish sauce 2 tablespoons chopped garlic 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro roots 1 1 / 2 teaspoons black_pepper 1 teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon curry_powder 1 ( 2 3 / 4- to 3-pound ) chicken , halved Sweet , Spicy Sauce In bowl combine coconut_milk , fish sauce , garlic , cilantro root , pepper , turmeric and curry_powder .

Bring to boil . Boil until reduced to 3 / 4 cup . Cool to room_temperature . * &quot; It ' s really a simple dish , &quot; says Andre Guerrero , talking_about his recipe for Filipino - style grilled pork chops . &quot; The marinade is just vinegar , garlic and pepper , but it changes the flavor so much. &quot; Born in Quezon City just outside Manila , Guerrero is chef-owner of Duet restaurant in Glendale . Pork Inihaw is not on the menu there but is always available because customers demand it , he says . Guerrero grills lean meat , but in the Philippines , fatty cuts are preferred because the drippings sizzling onto the coals enhance smokiness . Guerrero paints meat with olive_oil for a similar but more healthful effect . DUET ' S PORK INIHAW 1 1 / 2 cups white vinegar 1 / 4 cup plus 1 tablespoon crushed , minced garlic 1 tablespoon freshly ground black_pepper 8 pork chops , to equal about 2 1 / 2 pounds total 1 tablespoon fish sauce Combine 1 cup vinegar , 1 / 4 cup garlic and pepper . Flatten pork chops slightly by pounding with mallet or side of cleaver . Marinate pork chops in vinegar mixture 1 hour . Combine remaining vinegar and garlic with fish sauce . Drain pork chops and grill about 5 minutes on each side , or until done . Serve at once with vinegar-garlic dip on side . Makes 4 servings .

Here is his recipe for grilled chicken balls similar to those served at Nanbantei of Tokyo in Little Tokyo ' s Weller Court . Uwate explains that the quality of tare , the dipping sauce that seasons the chicken , reveals the caliber of the chef . This is an easy version for home cooks . The amount of sugar should be adjusted according to the sweetness of the mirin in the tare . MATAO UWATE ' S GRILLED GROUND CHICKEN ( Tsukune ) 1 pound ground chicken 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion 2 teaspoons black sesame_seeds , toasted in ungreased pan until they pop Salt Tare In bowl combine chicken with onion and sesame_seeds .

Makes 2 / 3 cup . * Kenji Salz , executive chef of the Four Seasons Resort in Bali , came_to Los Angeles in September to cook at Spago and Chinois . During his stay , Salz demonstrated Bali ' s distinctive sate lilit , molding meat paste around flat wooden sate sticks that he had brought from Bali . For shrimp sate , he used lemon grass stalks . Salz seasons the meat with a spice paste traditionally used for betutu , which is Balinese roast duck . His sate may seem complicated to prepare , but the results are worth it . Leftover betutu spice paste can be used with baked chicken and is excellent with the duck legs available in Asian markets . Bake the duck legs at 325 degrees 45 minutes to melt the fat . Place the well-drained legs on a large sheet of foil . Spread some of spice paste on each side and season to taste with salt . Wrap with foil , place in a baking pan and bake at 325 degrees 45 minutes . Uncover and bake 30 minutes longer , or until browned . KENJI SALZ ' S SATE LILIT 2 tablespoons sliced shallot 2 tablespoons sliced garlic 1 tablespoon oil 1 1 / 2 pounds boneless , skinned chicken_leg meat 2 tablespoons Basic Betutu Spices 2 tablespoons finely chopped lemon grass 1 / 2 kaffir lime leaf , shredded Salt , pepper Sweet Sambal Peanut Sauce In skillet fry shallot and garlic in oil until tender .
