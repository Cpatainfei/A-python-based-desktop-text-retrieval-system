   <HEADLINE> THE GREAT RACE ; DRIVEN BY EAGER POLITICIANS AND A CONTRACTOR WHO STOOD TO EARN $ 200 # 000 FOR EVERY DAY THEY FINISHED AHEAD OF SCHEDULE , A TEAM OF WORKERS SET_OUT TO REBUILD THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY . THE RESULT : 18 MONTHS OF WORK IN 66 DAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Contractor C.C. Myers , a self-made multimillionaire whose toys include Rolls-Royces , a stretch limousine , a Cessna , a jet and a helicopter , had a more substantial gift in mind for his 56th birthday . He wanted the concrete deck of the quake-shattered Santa Monica Freeway poured and smoothed , the last major hurdle before the freeway could be reopened , the last thing standing between him and a multimillion-dollar bonus for finishing early . But first he ' d have to get the cooperation of his ironworkers , who were exhausted from the round-the-clock , seven-day-a-week pace , some even asking that their shifts be cut from 12 hours to eight . Myers , who prided himself on bidding smart and talking tough , was going_to have to persuade the ironworkers not only to avoid cutting_back but to work even faster . He paid a call_on the ironworkers ' supervisors . Myers , his hulking 6 feet , 4 inches elevated by black ostrich-skin boots , seemed to fill the ramshackle trailer under the freeway . Ignoring the offer of a chair , he sat on a rickety bench that creaked and swayed beneath him . The two foremen listened to his pitch , praying that he would n ' t topple to the floor . If Myers wanted them to spur on their men , they said , they ' d need personal incentives . A deal was cut . Myers promised $ 250 to the night_shift foreman , $ 250 to his Little_League team and $ 1 # 000 to be spread among his 20 men . Workers on both shifts would get a lavish Italian meal . Like Myers says , &quot; You have to know how to stir the pot. &quot; So on Myers ' birthday , March 31 , the concrete was poured , days ahead of schedule . And instead of flying in his private jet to meet his wife and two sons at their home near Sacramento , Clinton Myers celebrated his birthday with the men who call themselves &quot; rodbusters , &quot; men who were uneasy about wearing dirty jeans and torn T-shirts in the fancy restaurant . His voice thick_with emotion and red_wine , he thanked the men and pulled_out his wallet . Peeling_off hundred-dollar bills , he carefully set 10 of them on the table . It was a communal moment of sheer triumph . &quot; You guys worked your butts off , &quot; Myers told the ironworkers . &quot; You ought to be proud_of what you accomplished. &quot; They , along with teams of carpenters , finishers and laborers , a squad of more_than 400 at its height , had done the undoable -- they had speeded the rebuilding of the Santa Monica Freeway so traffic would flow on April 12 , more_than two months earlier than state officials had predicted . Working through nights , weekends and rain , they had done_in 66 days what would have taken 18 months under normal circumstances . It was a feat made_possible by powerful forces : a President , courting California voters , who opened federal coffers ; a governor , running_for reelection , who cut red_tape ; movers and shakers who demanded that the artery connecting Downtown to the politically powerful Westside be opened now ; a recession-weary construction force , desperate for overtime ; and , maybe most of all , a boss like C.C. Myers . IN 1965 , AS A DIXIELAND BAND PLAYED , A GOODYEAR BLIMP SWUNG A TIRE from the end of a 150-foot rope to rip through the ribbon just west of La Cienega Boulevard , opening the Santa Monica Freeway . At a cost of more_than $ 200 million , Los Angeles at long last had its first major east-west artery . It quickly became the freeway that Angelenos most loved and hated . It offered a speedier trip to the coast than surface streets , but its lanes were always crowded , suffering rush-hour jams in both directions . It was the busiest freeway in America and when the Northridge earthquake smashed it , Angelenos were desperate for its prompt return . The state ' s chief bridge engineer , Jim Roberts of Sacramento , was shaving when his telephone rang at 5 a.m. on Jan . 17 , the Martin_Luther_King holiday . Roberts had figured he would work without interruption until noon at Caltrans headquarters , but the phone_call upset his plans and for an instant , the 41-year Caltrans veteran wished he ' d retired . Then he shifted into gear . Roberts had been through the 1971 Sylmar quake and the 1989 Loma Prieta , in which collapsed freeways killed 43 . He knew what to expect this time . He mobilized his staff , then faced the klieg_lights for a barrage of questions from reporters . Roberts , 63 , admitted that the prognosis was not good . Caltrans officials initially predicted it would take 12 to 18 months to rebuild the region ' s damaged thoroughfares . When they promised a flat-out , no-holds-barred campaign to deliver the restored freeways within six months , many were skeptical . After all , five years after the Loma Prieta earthquake devastated the Bay Area , not all_the damaged freeways there have been completely rebuilt . The shattered Santa Monica had been scheduled for retrofitting one month later . Had the quake hit after the retrofit , the bridges at Washington and Fairfax might well have survived . A nearby off-ramp at Cadillac Avenue , newly retrofitted with steel jackets , was unscathed . Only hours after the quake , a regiment of federal and state transportation officials -- and Gov . Wilson -- flew to Los Angeles . Cynics say that ' s because it ' s an election year . But Caltrans officials say no one ever mentioned politics . &quot; It was not to be business as usual because of the impact on the economy and the inability of the people in Los Angeles to move_around , &quot; says Caltrans director James W . van Loben Sels . &quot; Here was an opportunity to show that bureaucrats are not intrinsically bureaucratic. &quot; Wilson and Van Loben Sels ordered shortcuts in Caltrans ' labyrinthine bureaucracy , allowing the agency to shave months from normal bidding procedures . For the small projects , Caltrans didn ' t bother with competitive bidding . It asked C.C. Myers and four other contractors to bid the Santa Monica project . These were outfits that had offices in Southern California , had built Caltrans projects before , could move quickly , and would be able to meet the goal of drawing 40 % of their subcontractors from minority- or women-owned companies , Roberts says . Caltrans dispatched employees -- loaded with a carton of plans and specifications -- on airplanes to reach the five contractors , so each received the same information at roughly the same time . Their bids were evaluated and the contract was awarded the same day . Instead of starting in the standard 15 days , Myers began work within 24 hours , dispatching crews from his Gardena office to prepare_for drilling the 50-foot shafts for the foundation . Later , there would be some complaints . Jim Carter , one of Myers ' former partners and president of MCM Construction Inc. , was angry that his North Highlands company -- a fierce Myers competitor and one of the top firms in California -- had not been invited to bid on the Santa Monica , though he had been asked to bid on other quake reconstruction jobs . &quot; Why weren ' t we asked ? &quot; Carter questions . &quot; It just slays us because Myers has the easiest project and the most incentive . It ' s a slam-dunk kind of thing. &quot; But in the hours and days after the quake , nothing looked easy . And Caltrans officials were not just considering the convenience of Los Angeles motorists . If the reconstruction was completed within 180 days , the federal_government would pick_up the entire tab , standard for national disasters . Initially , the cost of repairing damaged freeways and establishing alternative transportation was estimated at $ 1 billion -- an amount that was more_than halved as officials began reviewing their bills last month . &quot; When you get_into an emergency like this , you just do_it , &quot; Roberts says . &quot; We ' re not doing anything immoral or illegal , we ' re just doing everything faster. &quot; BRUTOCO ENGINEERING &amp; CONSTRUCTION HAD PLEDGED TO DO THE JOB in the least time -- 100 days -- and for $ 20 million . But the Fontana-based company withdrew when an error was discovered on its application . On Feb . 4 , Caltrans selected Myers , the second-lowest bidder , based on a combination of time and money . Myers agreed to do the job in 140 days for $ 14.9 million . And Caltrans created an unusual incentive -- Myers would receive $ 200 # 000 for every day that the freeway was opened ahead of schedule . If he was late , he would be penalized the same amount . The deal triggered a nonstop race in which Myers rode his crews , sometimes cajoling , sometimes goading , sometimes screaming . No one could rebuild the Santa Monica Freeway faster , Myers boasted . Myers knew what the job would take . After the Loma Prieta earthquake , his company , C.C. Myers Inc. of Rancho Cordova , rebuilt two damaged bridges on Highway 1 near Watsonville in record time . Caltrans allotted 100 days for that project , the first in which cash incentives were offered . Despite winter rains , Myers finished the job 45 days ahead of schedule -- earning $ 1 million in incentive pay . &quot; This is a guy who ' s done this and knows how , &quot; says Roberts . &quot; He ' s a real hustler ; he ' s got everybody organized to move fast . I visited the job after Loma Prieta : Myers had five different operations going simultaneously . On a normal job , you have a couple. &quot; Myers , one of 13 children raised on a hardscrabble farm in Highland , dropped_out of the 10th grade and left his father ' s home carrying all his belongings in a small box to stay with his mother in Long_Beach , sleeping under the awning of her trailer . He became a carpenter ' s apprentice , eventually working for Los Angeles builder Benny Benedict , and went_on to become a regional supervisor in Benedict ' s company . Almost two decades later , their roles were reversed . Polich &amp; Benedict Inc. had folded and Myers had started his own company . He hired his onetime boss , and when the older_man retired five years ago , Myers threw a wingding for 200 at the Sheraton Rancho Cordova and gave Benedict the keys to a maroon Rolls-Royce . He can afford to take_care of old friends . His construction firm has branched_out into development and now owns more_than 5 # 000 acres in California , 300 in Las Vegas , 100 in Colorado and another 800 in Utah . He ' s invested in Oklahoma gas and a newly opened casino resort in the Czech Republic . He ' s sold $ 35 million worth of homes_in Las Vegas and $ 5 million worth of lots in Utah , he says . He donated 400 acres to the state of Utah , a parcel he figures would be an ideal site for the Winter_Olympics , keeping 800 acres adjacent , where he ' s now building homes . And he ' s saving one prime spot for himself , a site on top of a mountain where he ' d have a spectacular view of racing skiers . He doesn ' t ski ; his sons do . Though final details of the contract are still in flux , Myers will win a bonus of as much as $ 13.8 million on the Santa Monica job . Some of this , Myers says , will be eaten_up by the cost of hiring around-the-clock crews and other expenses tied to accelerating the work . His payroll each week usually topped $ 1 million . Myers figures about $ 8 million of the bonus will be profit , and some of that will go_to the purchase of a bigger , faster jet . He also wanted to reward his workers , so he has already spent about $ 30 # 000 buying $ 100 dinner gift certificates for those who worked_at least two weeks on the Santa Monica . &quot; I ' m like a spider . I start crawling out there and getting a hold of things , &quot; says Myers . &quot; You start_out with nothing then you really want to see what you can accomplish. &quot; Rebuilding the freeway was not just about money , he insists . It was the challenge . It was the chance to say , without seeming to brag , &quot; We are the best. &quot; CALTRANS AWARDED THE CONTRACT TO MYERS EVEN BEFORE THE BRIDGE blueprints were finished . While all_the other repairs_to downed freeways were designed by Caltrans , the agency turned_to consultant Wei Koo for the Santa Monica . Koo knew the bridges inside and out ; the Orange-based structural engineer had designed the planned retrofits . Koo and his team of 30 began work Jan . 21 and delivered the first set of drawings to Caltrans six days later . The last set was turned_in on March 4 , a little more_than a month before the bridge opened_to traffic . &quot; Normally , this job would have taken nine months , &quot; says Koo , whose firm will receive about $ 520 # 000 for the design . Usually , a set of bridge plans is sent to Caltrans headquarters , where they are evaluated for a period of weeks , or even months . Then they are submitted to peer_review . Finally , when a design clears those hurdles , it is handed_over to the builder . But this time , C.C. Myers got the plans in installments after Koo finished them and Caltrans approved them . The peer_review occurred after construction had begun , something Koo describes as &quot; gut-wrenching. &quot; If the plans failed the review , both he and Myers would have had to start all_over . But the plans ran_into no real obstacles . Among those who reviewed them was Nigel Priestley , professor of structural engineering at UC San Diego and a leader in bridge design . &quot; We made minor comments , &quot; Priestley says . &quot; The design appeared to be competent , well-conceived , and had the sort of details we hoped to see. &quot; The original structures could withstand displacement of no more_than two inches when the earth shook , Koo says . The new 491-foot-long Fairfax structure can sway as much as 17 inches without damage . At La Cienega , the 776-foot span will displace up_to 11 inches . In the original design , the steel was placed in a series of circles embedded in concrete supporting_columns . But the ends of those circles were not joined , which allowed the columns to break_open and crumble . The new ones are built with steel hoops within the columns . They are also designed to have many_more steel bars , all woven closely together . All told , the two structures take almost 6 million pounds of reinforcing steel . It meant more work for the ironworkers . And it meant a bridge whose design evolved even as Myers built it . These factors spelled constant aggravation for Myers , who often barreled into the Caltrans trailer on the construction site to see Tyrone Taylor , the agency ' s resident engineer . &quot; It ' s a f- - -ing disaster . All that steel costs us a lot of time , &quot; Myers railed one day . &quot; It ' s abnormal -- no one anticipated this kind of bull- - - - . We bid to build a standard bridge. &quot; Such conversations were common . Taylor never lost his temper . And he was embarrassed when they occurred in front of a reporter . &quot; This is off the record , off the record , &quot; he declared as Myers ranted about the bridge design . &quot; All we bid on is a normal , standard Caltrans bridge , &quot; Myers stormed . &quot; Now you are adding all this bull- - - - . If it wasn ' t for all these problems , I ' d be done 10 days sooner. &quot; The problems were many : Workers found old foundations and an abandoned drainage structure , not indicated on the plans , that had to be removed . Drillers discovered contaminated water . Patched water_lines leaked , causing cranes and cement trucks to sink_in the soggy ground . Hoping to make_up lost time , Myers proposed to Caltrans that he use a quick-drying cement on the bridge_decks . While concrete typically takes_up to 10 days to cure , this stuff would dry in two days . But because it is expensive , the concrete -- used on airport runways -- had never been poured for Caltrans bridges , and therefore would n ' t be used this time . He used a cement that dried in five days , but this still meant that squeezing the workers was the only way to accelerate the rebuilding of the freeway bridges . ON MOST CONSTRUCTION JOBS , HAMMERS POUND ONLY EIGHT HOURS A day , five days a week , and they stop for rain and holidays . It ' s a somewhat orderly tag-team event -- pile-drivers create the foundation ; carpenters set_up the falsework , the wooden frame that creates a temporary bridge ; the ironworkers take_over ; carpenters return to erect wooden forms ; and then the finishers pour the concrete . But now the rules have been tossed . Crews from each trade nip one another , pushing for the other to work faster and get_out of the way . Myers eggs them on . Myers asks the ironworkers : &quot; You like those carpenters butting you in the ass all_the time ? &quot; Then he scolds the carpenters for going too slowly . Myers puts one supervisor , Kojak , ( who refuses to give his real name , preferring to go_by the one he acquired when he shaved his head ) in_charge of the bridge at Fairfax Avenue and Washington Boulevard , and another supervisor , Dwayne Barth , in_charge of the one at Venice and La Cienega boulevards . He plays the two men off one another . &quot; Looks_like Kojak is starting to smoke you , &quot; Myers tells Barth . &quot; That little f- - - - - is going_to bite your ass . You better get going. &quot; And when he sees Kojak later , he takes him aside , warning him : &quot; The kid is going_to get you. &quot; The result is a fiercely competitive race , in which the ironworkers grouse that the carpenters are delaying them . The finishers scream that the ironworkers are too slow . The day crew complains that the night_shift isn ' t pulling its weight . The night crew claims that the day crew is lazy and leaves the narrow scaffolding walkways cluttered . They work 12 hours , or longer , seven days a week . With huge 4 # 000-watt light towers , the work continues 24 hours a day . One week is the equivalent of four on an ordinary site . When a worker leaves and returns for his next shift , invisible hands have continued his labors . He no longer picks_up where he left_off , something many find disconcerting . &quot; You feel no ownership here , &quot; says Cecil Jennings , 31 , a carpenter from Paramount . &quot; Here , we do our section and it ' s already poured by the time you come_back . It ' s not my bridge . There are too many people out there. &quot; Thirty-three days into the job , workers swarm over plywood and timber . In the glare of the sunlight , the bridges loom large , vast expanses of tawny yellow wood frame that look nothing like roads . The motion and noise are constant , men shouting orders , the beep-beep-beep of heavy equipment backing_up , the popping of nail guns , the thud of lumber being moved , the clanging of metal . Frustrated motorists maneuver past . A driver leans_on his horn as he whizzes by , yelling : &quot; Work faster , work faster. &quot; Nights are more peaceful . No traffic . Fewer workers . At dusk , klieg_lights are set_up , making this stretch of construction seem almost like a movie set . Both bridges are informally divided into sections , each at a different phase . In one , carpenters hammer a wooden deck . In another , they build wooden forms so concrete can be poured . In yet another , ironworkers lay out steel rods , weaving them into a complex grid . The ironworkers , builders say , have the worst of a bridge job . In teams , they hoist long rods of joined reinforcing steel , weighing several hundred pounds , that can bend like uncooked strands of spaghetti . At other times , they work separately , lacing together shorter lengths of steel rebar , weighing up_to 150 pounds . Ironworkers lose fingers . A bad back comes_with the trade . Their bodies ache , a constant dull pain that the old-timers say becomes as automatic as swallowing . &quot; The bars drop on your feet and you just kind of grin and bear it . You keep going until the pain is gone , &quot; says Sam LoVetere , 25 , an ironworker from Huntington Beach . One by one , LoVetere carefully carries and places the rods several inches apart on the deck . Next , bent over double , he lifts a rod several inches above the deck , thrusting a small concrete block beneath it , so that when the concrete is poured , the bars will be surrounded . The ironworkers have a rhythm . Step . Crouch . Place a block . Step . Crouch . Place a block . It is interrupted only by forages for more steel rebar , stacks of which are lifted to the deck by a towering crane . When the blocks are set , the dance changes : Step . Crouch . Tie . Step . Crouch . Tie . Seven days a week . Ten hours a day , for four weeks straight . LoVetere ' s father was an ironworker , but LoVetere says he does the job for one reason : the money . He usually earns about $ 25 an hour . For work_on Saturdays and overtime , he gets time-and-a-half . On Sundays , his pay is doubled . He knew he ' d be working long shifts that would stretch into seemingly endless weeks . All told , he grossed about $ 8 # 000 for his 27 days ' work here . Ironworkers have their own culture , tools and attire . They take their breaks by themselves . They pride themselves on being the sure-footed bad boys of the bridge , known for their colorful language and their ability to endure backbreaking labor . That pride , however , made them a target for Myers . If they were so good , why didn ' t they work faster ? Many of the workers and foremen didn ' t relish encounters with Myers , who says he hasn ' t taken a vacation in 17 years . &quot; To him , everything is cash . He steps_on everybody . He can buy and sell you like you were nothin ' , &quot; said one . &quot; He looks right through people . But his checks don ' t bounce. &quot; The job was going well . There were the minor nits and wrinkles of construction , a seemingly never-ending flow of small mishaps . The crane had dislodged itself from its tracks . One abutment appeared to be almost one foot too high . A Caltrans inspector questioned the mix of concrete being poured into a patch . But no major trials . So , as he did on evenings when he was pleased , he offered to treat his top men to dinner . Myers and his men chewed_over the events of the very long day at a cheap pizza joint . Prompted by the fleeting image on a nearby television of a scantily_clad woman in a boxing ring , they launched a discussion of why there are so few women wrestlers , which , in turn , led to the pros and cons of silicone breasts . It meant the day went well . Otherwise , the men would n ' t deviate from talk_of work . On this night , there was a sense of family . The men , who ' d cursed one another at various times in the past weeks , now ribbed each other . Everyone accused Kojak of trying to hoard all_the heavy equipment at his end of the freeway . WITH THE THRONGS OF WORKERS laboring long hours , the minor-injury rate was slightly higher than the national average . About 30 needed stitches or walk-in medical attention . The most serious accident occurred two days before the freeway opened , when a foreman inadvertently backed a pickup_truck over a kneeling carpenter , breaking his pelvis . Even one of Myers ' top men suffered a minor mishap . Gary Janco , Myers ' right-hand_man and the first employee he hired when he started his company in 1977 , cut his foot with a chain_saw . Janco simply put duct tape on his boot and limped around . Janco , along with 24 of his key lieutenants , was summoned for the Santa Monica because he had worked_on the Watsonville bridges and knew the breakneck pace Myers wanted to set_on this one . He normally oversees all_of Myers ' Northern California projects , and here , he orchestrated the logistics of the bridge reconstruction -- an event that resembles a military maneuver in its staging . He spent much of his time on the phone , wheedling and extracting what he needed from suppliers . The heavy equipment -- including nine cranes , four loaders , 26 light towers , five air_compressors and nine generators -- had to arrive in good working condition . And tons of steel and timber had to be delivered on_time . When the railroad couldn ' t fetch steel beams quickly enough , Myers agreed to pay an extra $ 119 # 000 to have them delivered within three days by train . Janco can ' t remember how many bridges he ' s built , there have been so many . But for project engineer Dermot Fallon , 26 , his graduate engineering degree newly minted from Long_Beach State , the counting was easy -- this was his first . &quot; This is the project of a lifetime , right here . This is the whole reason I wanted to get_into construction , to build a job like this , &quot; he says . &quot; This job has it all . You got the pain and you got the glory . I can see myself in 30 years driving with my kid , saying ' Son , I built this. ' &quot; Every now and then , in little snatches of time , it dawned on Fallon that his life would soon change . Fallon plans to marry in November . But on the bridge he could think_of little besides surveying . Sometimes he awakened in a panic in the middle of the night , fretting that he had made a mistake . &quot; This job never leaves you . This job doesn ' t begin at 7 and end at 7 -- you are making decisions on the radio , the second you leave the house , &quot; says Fallon , who lives_in Long_Beach . &quot; Everything has been put_on hold for this job . No surfin ' , no nothing . This job , you are pushing , pushing , pushing -- there ' s no time to get ahead. &quot; His day started at 6:15 a.m. and ended somewhere between nine to 20 hours later . On other jobs , he ' d had time to sit_down and study the plans , but on this one , the plans kept changing . He ' d stand_out on falsework giving orders based on the sketches in his hand when a Caltrans inspector would walk over to tell him that there were now new plans . During the first three weeks of work , this sometimes happened every day . There were about 25 Caltrans inspectors , clad in white jumpsuits and orange safety vests with blue hard_hats , checking and double-checking the work , making_sure it was in accordance with the plan and building_codes . They earned anywhere from $ 16 to $ 26 per hour , with time-and-a-half for overtime . Inspector Lillian Yan , a petite , soft-spoken woman with her black hair pulled_back in a ponytail , roamed the site with the tools of her trade : a spool of ribbons and a tape_measure in her hands . During her 12-hour shifts , she measured the depth of cement , spaces between steel bars and all_the other details . If she found a mistake , the workers did_it over , Yan says firmly . She combed the bridge , tagging errors with the ribbons . Red for ironworkers , blue for carpenters , yellow for laborers . Only Yan or another inspector was allowed to remove the ribbons . At first , maybe , she felt pressure , the burden of long hours and keeping pace with the workers . But it settled into an almost mesmerizing routine . When Yan , 24 , began working_on the freeway , she says , &quot; I just stopped the rest of my life for a while. &quot; At best , inspectors are regarded_as obstacles to progress . One superintendent jokes , &quot; Every time I see those damn ribbons , I just pull them off. &quot; Once the inspector gives the OK to pour , the finishers need a steady flow of concrete . But the concrete will begin to harden if it ' s in the mix trucks too long . Too many trucks can mean expensive waste ; too few would hinder the work . On March 31 , there were not enough trucks . Myers got_on the phone with the supplier . When he hires a subcontractor on this job , he gets the company head ' s home number , and he calls_at any time of the day or night . &quot; This is Myers . Can we get more concrete on Venice ? You ' re killing us . We ' re stopping and starting . I got my people hollering at me . I never had nobody hollering at me like that. &quot; There was a pause as he listened to the response . &quot; You ' ll have to do_better , &quot; he said coldly . Within the hour , a dozen trucks lined_up , their drivers napping as they waited for their turn_to service the pourer . Clarissa Hinman was foreman of the concrete finishers , a rare woman in this predominantly male world and one of a handful of women foremen at Myers . Now 50 , she lost her job as a social_worker counseling battered women 15 years ago and has been a finisher ever since . In the beginning , she tried to go_to graduate_school , too . But she had so little time for her daughter that she had to drop_out . &quot; I was much more excited about learning a trade , being outdoors , &quot; says Hinman , who grew_up on a farm . Softly , so no one will hear , she says , &quot; I ' m a feminist. &quot; At first , Hinman couldn ' t pick_up a 100-pound sack of sand -- but she learned . &quot; I ' m tough . Straightforward and bossy , &quot; she says . &quot; I like the physical work , I like working hard . It ' s tangible. &quot; Hinman , exacting and precise , is now a connoisseur of concrete pours . &quot; In a bridge , everything has to be supremely flat , pleasing to the eye , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s got_to be classy , smooth . It ' s our job to finish it properly , so other workers can do their job. &quot; Concrete finisher David Vargas and his fellow concrete finishers pulled on tall rubber_boots , many of them using duct tape to bind the boots to their pants so concrete couldn ' t slide in . They stepped into shin-deep fresh concrete , following the nozzle of the pourer , then , bent nearly double , used shovels to distribute the concrete evenly and floats to smooth it . &quot; Chemicals in the concrete make_it really hot , &quot; says Vargas , who earns $ 20.26 an hour . &quot; It ' s not really hot at first . When it starts setting , steam comes_off . You yank your legs up_to take a step ; it ' s like 10 pounds on your legs . Wherever you step , you ' ve got_to cover it up . You step , you fix . You step , you fix. &quot; When the pour began , Vargas was eager to show that he was a good worker . He had been employed only eight months last year , and is saving to weather the next dry spell . &quot; It ' s very competitive in construction , &quot; says the finisher from Pico Rivera . &quot; You have got_to prove yourself . We go 100 miles per hour. &quot; Vargas and the others are_well aware that they are easily replaced in a recession-plagued industry , in which union officials say that between 35 % and 50 % of their members are unemployed . On the Santa Monica project , which used only union labor , dozens of men and women showed_up day and night pleading for a job , any job -- even washing the company cars . &quot; If you don ' t do_it , and do_it right , someone else will , &quot; says Billy Herrera , 41 , a labor foreman who drove almost two hours to his Ventura County home when he finished his 12-hour shift . The jobs don ' t wait , workers say . Joe Alvarez ' s wife was expecting their fourth baby . But Alvarez , a crane oiler from Upland , was employed only seven months last year and didn ' t figure he ' d accompany his wife to the hospital for the baby ' s birth . &quot; I ' ve kinda got_it stuck_in the back of my mind , &quot; says Alvarez , 35 . &quot; But times have been hard -- you have to take_advantage of when the work is there. &quot; As it turned_out , Anna Alvarez went_into labor on a Saturday night after her husband came_home from work . While he slept , she drove herself to the hospital because she wasn ' t sure if she was in_labor and he was so exhausted . She called him and he joined her at the hospital before she delivered their baby , Kathleen . Alvarez took the day_off . BEFORE THE FREEWAY opened , even before the concrete had dried , the politicking reached a frenzy . The prize was a grand one , early completion of the Santa Monica Freeway -- an unsullied example of government working as Angelenos would hope . Yet there were questions : Had Caltrans miscalculated , was that why Myers finished early ? Had the state been rooked ? Caltrans officials say that all_the Santa Monica bids were within range of Myers ' , and that those bids , in part , set the parameters of the project . &quot; We want a quality job , and we want it done safely , &quot; Roberts says . &quot; We don ' t want to push people too close to the wall. &quot; But such explanations couldn ' t fully allay the sticker shock of Myers ' huge bonus . &quot; Caltrans still doesn ' t understand project management , they obviously thought it would take six months to do the Santa Monica , &quot; says Assemblyman Richard Katz . &quot; To be able to shave almost two months off that project makes me wonder if this contractor is going_to reap a windfall because Caltrans did such a poor job estimating. &quot; Even amid such complaints , however , everyone wanted to claim credit for restoring the freeway that cost the local economy $ 1 million a day in delayed deliveries and service . On Monday , April 4 , federal_officials -- who footed the bill on the Santa Monica ' s reconstruction -- and Mayor Richard Riordan ' s staff were told that the freeway would not open for &quot; weeks. &quot; The very next day , Wilson upstaged them by announcing that the freeway would open seven days hence . The opening ceremony was scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday , April 12 , although traffic would flow as soon as the barrier rails and signs were in place . It was meant to be a gala event , attended by Vice_President Al Gore and Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena , as well as Riordan and Wilson . But on the eve of the planned hoopla , Caltrans officials announced that the freeway would open later that night at 11 o ' clock , April 11 -- in time for the evening news . Wilson , Riordan and Pena -- the latter of whom was reached 90 minutes before the event -- attended the impromptu press_conference . The other federal dignitaries , however , had not yet arrived . When Myers showed_up with his friends , a Highway Patrol officer brusquely ordered them to move their cars to make_way for the governor ' s motorcade . Hal Taines , Myers ' real_estate partner and longtime friend , turned_to him , and asked : &quot; Have they paid_for the freeway yet ? If they haven ' t paid , they can ' t tell you where to park. &quot; Helicopters hovered overhead , scores of television_cameras lined the freeway as the politicians removed the orange cones that had blocked the cars . Myers , standing with his wife , Janelle , watched from the freeway shoulder . Motorists , honking and cheering , surged forward . The job was done . &quot; I ' ve never seen an opening like this . Watsonville didn ' t have one-quarter of this , &quot; Myers said . The very next day , under a hot sun beside the freeway , there were congratulatory speeches . Myers , dressed in a black suit , was asked to sit with Caltrans officials and dignitaries on the podium . Myers ' lieutenants turned_out for the occasion . Janco wore a suit . Kojak wore clean jeans . Gore presented Myers and several Caltrans officials with a hammer , adorned with red , white and blue_ribbon , set_in a gold frame . The note read : &quot; Thanks for rebuilding the bridge and for helping to rebuild America ' s trust in government , Al Gore. &quot; The audience cheered . Dozens of cameras were thrust forward . Kojak rolled his eyes . &quot; It ' s just a bridge. &quot;</TEXT>
