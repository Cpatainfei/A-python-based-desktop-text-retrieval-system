   <TEXT> Across the globe , millions of people are_on the move . Today , about 100 million live outside their countries of birth . Their motives are many , but the most popular one is economic opportunity . Refugees fleeing war or persecution doubled in number in the turbulent 1980s , but they still represent only a minority of all migrants . These are some of the discoveries in a new report , &quot; Global Migration : People on_the_Move , &quot; by Population Action International in Washington , D.C. The report tells who is going where--and why . There ' s plenty to keep track of . The number of long-term migrants from developing to developed countries has mushroomed four-fold since the the early 1960s , the study says . The engine of this trend is inequality : Rich nations got richer over the decades while poor nations fared poorly or stagnated . Political conflict , labor surpluses , exhaused farm land and government policies aimed at family unification also cause migration . To put it all_in perspective , though , migrants represent only 2 % of the world ' s population . Most people never leave their home country . TYPES OF MIGRATION * Between wealthy nations Migration of workers between industrialized countries is growing , especially in Western Europe , where the emergence of the European Union has blurred traditional political and economic boundaries . * To wealthier nations The number of long-term migrants from developing to developed countries increased from about 230 # 000 a year in the early 1960s to roughly 940 # 000 by the late 1980s . Today North_America , especially the United States , is the greatest magnet . In Europe , North Africans and Turks moved to France and Germany in large_numbers in the 1960s and 1970s . Since 1985 , migration to Europe has diversified to include Asians and new destinations , such_as Italy and Spain , which formerly were sources of migrants . * Between developing countries In Latin_America and Africa , most flows have been between neighboring countries . In sub-Saharan Africa at least 10 million people are believed to be migrants or refugees . In Latin_America , wealthier countries such_as Argentina and Venezuela absorb people from nearby nations . WHERE THEY GO Often , migrants go right next door--as with Mexicans entering the United States . But political and historical ties , such_as those between Britain and Commonwealth countries , can send people around the world . Culture and language also matter ; many French-speakers move to France , for instance . Illegal migration in the United States is estimated at about 200 # 000 to 300 # 000 a year , compared to legal immigrants , who in 1992 numbered 974 # 000 .
