   <HEADLINE> CLINTON LETTER OPPOSES ANTI-GAY BALLOT INITIATIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton has given his support to homosexual rights groups with a letter strongly opposing anti-gay ballot initiatives in states across the country . &quot; Those who would legalize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or any other grounds are gravely mistaken about the values that make our nation strong , &quot; Clinton said in a letter to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund . &quot; The essential right to equality must_not be denied by a ballot initiative or otherwise. &quot; The letter was dated Monday and -- with the blessing of the White_House -- was released Tuesday by the group , a political_action_committee that supports openly gay candidates . At the start of his presidency , Clinton found himself embroiled in a political controversy over his campaign pledge to lift the ban on gays in the military , an issue that the Administration has just managed to put behind it with the final release of Pentagon regulations on the subject . After that difficult beginning , the White_House tried to recast Clinton ' s image in less liberal terms . But with his letter to the victory fund , Clinton placed himself in opposition to a major drive by conservative religious groups to promote such ballot measures . The victory fund said at least 11 states are considering the initiatives . Clinton described the effort to defeat such measures as &quot; a battle to protect the human_rights of every individual &quot; and said the &quot; simple principle of justice &quot; that people should be judged on their merits &quot; has come under assault in several states this year. &quot; Clinton ' s letter came five days after the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and other gay rights groups wrote to the President to ask_for &quot; a strong response &quot; from him opposing such initiatives . William Waybourn , executive_director of the victory fund , said he was surprised and pleased by the reply . He said he had gotten the signal from White_House officials in_advance of sending the letter that the Administration would be receptive to the request . A senior Administration official said he saw little political cost to Clinton in sending the letter . &quot; He was going_to have to take a position on it eventually , &quot; the official said of the ballot initiatives . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s a big thing. &quot;</TEXT>
