   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; DETENTE WITH IRAQ COULD SPOIL OIL SALES FOR OTHERS ; KUWAIT AND OTHER OPEC NEIGHBORS would n ' t MIND IF THE SANCTIONS STAY FOREVER . THEY ARE PICKING_UP BUSINESS THAT BAGHDAD HAS LOST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than four years ago , when U.S. soldiers and their comrades in_Operation Desert Storm liberated Kuwait , the emirate was_on fire . Nearly every one of Kuwait ' s 700 oil_wells was burning , the targets of Iraqi saboteurs , and the rest flowed like tributaries into great lakes of oil on the sand . The sky was black , and droplets of oil hung like humidity in the air , staining dishdashas and business_suits here in the capital . The crippled refineries were closed . It was , as one Western oil analyst here put it , &quot; as bad as it gets_in the oil business. &quot; Today , to the surprise of oil experts , Kuwait , a nation smaller than New Jersey with the third-largest oil reserves in the world , is fully back in business . Its three refineries are open and operating , and the nation is pumping 2 million barrels of crude a day , equal_to pre-Persian Gulf War levels . But the latest threat from Iraq , and its desperation to fling_off the noose of U.N. sanctions , has been a blunt reminder to Kuwait and its Gulf neighbors that one of the world ' s most important oil producers is still on the sidelines and that they owe much of their economic and political stability to the U.N. restraints on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Since the Gulf War ended in 1991 , the sanctions have cut Iraq , with the world ' s second-largest oil reserves , out of the world petroleum market , leaving Kuwait and others in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to happily take_up the slack . Iraq once produced about 3 million barrels of oil a day . Today it pumps just about 600 # 000 , enough to meet its domestic needs with a little left_over to be sold at discount to friends such_as Jordan . No one knows for_sure when , or even if , Iraq will accept all_the United Nations ' preconditions for lifting the trade_embargo . But that question is clearly on the minds of oilmen in nations such_as Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia , which would n ' t mind if the sanctions remained permanently . In public , those countries say regional security , and not oil revenue , is their main concern . &quot; Oil prices are not the core of the whole issue , &quot; said Saud al Sabah , Kuwait ' s information minister . &quot; The issue is Saddam ' s military capacity . He can export oil now if he uses the proceeds to buy_food and medicine for his people. &quot; The U.N. sanctions require oil profits be used only for humanitarian causes . But privately , government officials admit that if Iraq returned to full oil_production it could send prices for oil plummeting , touch_off rancorous debate in OPEC and set_up a testy economic battle in the region . &quot; Eventually , sooner or later , sanctions are going_to be lifted . And when that happens , let ' s face it , Iraq is going_to flood the market , &quot; a senior executive in the Kuwait Petroleum Corp . said . But many Western oil analysts doubt that Iraq could come_back to full production that fast . &quot; It ' ll be more of a phased event , &quot; a Western diplomat here predicted . &quot; I don ' t envision 22 tankers on the seas overnight. &quot; When Iraq re-enters the market , it will also face some difficult negotiations in OPEC , which was formed to keep oil prices high by placing production limits on oil-exporting countries . Iraq , Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia are among OPEC ' s 12 members . Many major world producers do not belong_to the cartel . &quot; There ' s going_to be some tough bargaining in OPEC , &quot; another Western diplomat said . &quot; Why should Kuwait or anyone else in OPEC bend over backward to help Iraq ? &quot; But some industry experts point_out that Iraq could end_up withdrawing from OPEC and sharply discounting its oil . The first battles on sanctions will come_in the U.N. Security_Council . U.N. conditions for lifting sanctions against Iraq are open_to some interpretation , and the United States is likely to take a harder line than Russia and France . Russia wants to see sanctions lifted so Iraq can begin paying_off its debts to Moscow , and two French oil_companies have reportedly reached agreement with Iraq to develop two oil fields once sanctions are removed . But some U.S. diplomats doubt that Iraq can ever clear the U.N. hurdles as long as Hussein is in power . Even if he agrees to some of the conditions -- by recognizing Kuwait ' s borders and agreeing not to use oil revenue on military spending , for example -- the Americans and others still won ' t trust him . Many oil market_analysts believe that it will be a year , at the earliest , before sanctions are lifted . That would be just fine with Kuwait , Saudi_Arabia and others in the Gulf . The possibility of detente , and Iraqi oil on the market again , makes many oil executives in this region jittery . In a race against that possibility , Kuwait is rapidly expanding its oil_production as well as its other petroleum enterprises , from refining to retail gasoline sales . It already has 6 # 500 gasoline_stations , owned by the government oil_company , from Europe to the Far East . With several multimillion-dollar expansion projects under way , Kuwait could boost its production capacity to 2.5 million by next year -- and to 3.5 million within five years . It has served notice that it will seek an increase in its quota when OPEC next revises its agreement , probably next year . Kuwait ' s comeback from the war has been , by all accounts , remarkable . During the seven months of Iraqi occupation , and in the final sabotage of the wells , 1 billion barrels of oil -- or 1 % of Kuwait ' s total capacity -- disappeared in smoke . Although Kuwait has a bloated official bureaucracy , the nation ' s brightest people work in the government-owned oil_industry . And they were able to bring_back full production within two years . &quot; I have the highest regard for these people , &quot; said a Western diplomat who dealt with Kuwaiti oil executives in exile . Many had feared that the oil fires would provoke an environmental catastrophe or that some wells would be damaged beyond repair . But the fires were quickly put_out by foreign firefighting crews . The air over Kuwait is clean again , but the oil lakes have been a challenge for environmental engineers . After some crude was siphoned_off , and some evaporated , all that was left were vast expanses of sludge , still visible from the air . Eventually the cleanup will cost millions , if not billions , of dollars . For such a small country , Kuwait ' s 96 billion barrels of proven oil reserves are immense , more_than four times the reserves of the United States . The bulk of that oil is in the Greater Burgan field , the world ' s second-largest , located about 20 miles south of Kuwait city . But there ' s oil all_over the country , from the northern border with Iraq to Kuwait city itself . It is those oil reserves that brought the Western world rushing to Kuwait ' s defense during the Gulf War , but Kuwaitis also know it is that underground treasure that has made them a target . &quot; If we didn ' t have the oil , &quot; Refai said , &quot; even Iraq would n ' t care about us. &quot; Valuable Reserves Six of the 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) are in the Persian_Gulf Region . A 1990 dispute over the Rumaila oil field , which straddles the Kuwait-Iraq border , helped lead to the Persian_Gulf_War in 1991 . Iraq Loses ; Others Gain Iraq was OPEC ' s second biggest oil producer before the 1990 U.N. embargo . Now other nations are filling_in the gap .
