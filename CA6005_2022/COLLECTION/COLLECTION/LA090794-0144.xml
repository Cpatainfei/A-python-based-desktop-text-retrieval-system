   <HEADLINE> ABORTION ACCORD GAINS SUPPORT ; POPULATION : COMPROMISE AT U.N. CONFERENCE_CALLS ON NATIONS TO DEAL WITH RISKS OF PROCEDURE BUT DOESN ' T PROMOTE IT AS FAMILY PLANNING TOOL . VATICAN IS HOLDOUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nations of the world rallied Tuesday around a compromise on abortion at the population conference here , lending substantial support to a measure calling_for governments to deal forthrightly with the health risks of illegal abortion while not promoting the procedure as a family_planning tool . Legalization of abortion would be up_to each nation to decide for itself under an emerging compromise that won substantial endorsement in principle from members of the U.N. committee seeking to finalize a new , 20-year plan for global population . The measure won support from nations as diverse as Pakistan and Norway . But the Vatican dashed all hope of a unanimous agreement Tuesday night when it opposed the compromise language , and the drafting committee delayed a final_decision pending new deliberations this morning , when Nicaragua and several other Latin_American states are scheduled to weigh in . Most conference officials predicted the abortion amendment would finally be agreed on over the objections of the Roman_Catholic_Church , which has opposed all global population plans over the past 20 years . But delegates were clearly frustrated that the Holy_See had failed to sign_on to the carefully drawn abortion provisions , designed to avert the church ' s fears of creating an international right to abortion . Still , with other compromises nearly complete on adolescent sexuality and non-traditional relationships , conference officials said they were_well on the way to overcoming some of the most divisive issues on world population . &quot; There was a powerful movement on the chapter . . . related to abortion , and a strong consensus . There was an overwhelming number of countries who said ( the compromise paragraph ) as it appears in the draft was the basis for the consensus , &quot; a Clinton_Administration official said Tuesday night . The paragraph no longer contains a reference_to &quot; sexual health education &quot; or a plea to governments to review their abortion laws and policies . And a call to consider women ' s health &quot; rather than relying_on criminal codes and punitive measures &quot; was eliminated . Vice_President Al Gore appeared to reach agreement with the Vatican on the issue of adolescent sexuality after meeting with the Holy_See ' s chief delegate , said Timothy E . Wirth , U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs and head of the U.S. delegation to the conference . Wirth reported that the Vatican representative called the latest compromise under discussion &quot; a concluded deal. &quot; An Administration official said the proposed compromise draws_on language from the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which notes the role and right of parents in providing guidance to adolescents in matters of reproductive health . Gore also clarified with the Vatican proposed language on non-traditional families , which the church feared could be seen as an endorsement of homosexual relationships . The clarifications preserve the original intent , which was to satisfy the request from several Caribbean and African_nations to sanction relationships such_as common-law_marriage that are outside the scope of traditional marriage . The first important signs of an overall agreement came early in the day when Benin , Malta and Ivory_Coast , which earlier had backed the Vatican ' s opposition to the abortion provisions , signed_on to the compromise along with several Muslim states . Later , when an informal working_group met to finalize the details , 10 additional nations , including Norway and Pakistan , endorsed the wording . Norway , with one of the most liberal abortion policies in the world , has endorsed worldwide decriminalization of abortion , while Pakistan , a predominantly Muslim nation , has shared the Islamic bloc ' s reservations on the issue . Thus their endorsement was seen as something of a bellwether , indicating the Vatican may be left nearly alone in its opposition . The Holy_See , in an official statement issued earlier in the day , reiterated its stand against abortion and artificial contraception , which has fueled much of the controversy behind the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development . The conference proposes to curb Earth ' s growth explosion by aiming for a global population of 7.2 billion in 20 years . There are currently 5.6 billion people . The Vatican acknowledged that the draft plan contains &quot; many positive points , &quot; lauding its focus_on education and health_care services for women and children . But it said the church could not give &quot; explicit or implicit support to those points of the document regarding abortion , the weakening of several family-related terminologies , the effective encouragement among adolescents of a liberal sexual lifestyle free_of parental rights , with no reference_to ethical values -- all_of which in the long term can only bring damage to individuals and society. &quot; Separately , the Holy_See implied it was prepared to quietly agree to disagree on the issue of contraception as long as it is specifically stated that family_planning programs do not include abortion . Liberal voices also expressed reservations about the emerging compromise , arguing that it does not go_far enough to protect women against the dangers of unsafe illegal abortions . &quot; We still view it as a compromise , &quot; said Jacqueline Jackson , chairwoman of the International Planned Parenthood Federation . She said Planned Parenthood , which operates family_planning clinics around the world and sits as an observer at this week ' s U.N. meeting , was of the view that the abortion language as it was emerging Tuesday does not provide enough focus_on women , does not adequately address the quality of care_for women , is not &quot; proactive enough &quot; and still provides &quot; the opportunity for people to view abortion as a legal issue , rather than a health_care issue. &quot; However , she said most opposition to the abortion issue had been overcome even from Muslim nations , many of which had initially shared the Vatican ' s concerns . Most Islamic scholars have ruled abortion illegal except to protect the health of the mother . &quot; A number of countries felt there still needed to be some work , but as of this morning , the majority of countries were supporting the alternate language replacement , &quot; Jackson said . The alternative language under discussion , which still could be revised somewhat during refinement talks , contains these elements : * In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family_planning . * All governments and non-governmental organizations are urged to deal openly and forthrightly with unsafe abortion as a major public health concern . * Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest priority , and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion . * In circumstances in which abortion is legal , women who wish to terminate their pregnancies should have ready access to reliable information and compassionate counseling , and such abortion should be safe . * Any measures to provide_for safe and legal abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national level through policy_changes and legislative processes that reflect the diversity of views on the issue of abortion . Several nations were still lobbying Tuesday night for minor wording changes , additions and deletions , some as conditions for signatures on the final document . For example , some want to say abortion should not be &quot; encouraged &quot; as a method of family_planning , rather than &quot; promoted. &quot; The U.S. delegation had suggested providing post-abortion family_planning counseling and education services to prevent repeat abortions . Wirth , in a meeting with reporters , reiterated the U.S. position that abortion should be &quot; safe , legal and rare. &quot;</TEXT>
