   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / NOVEL ; IMAGINING HAITI THROUGH THE PRISM OF MANY LIVES ; UNDER THE BONE BY ANNE-CHRISTINE D ' ADESKY ; FARRAR , STRAUS AND GIROUX $ 20 , 369 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nominally a novel , &quot; Under The Bone &quot; is actually a collage of literary techniques assembled to present a mural of contemporary Haitian life . In that impoverished and exploited island country , anguish has a_thousand shapes , misery a_million forms . To convey that sad and almost infinite variety of suffering , the author uses reportage , drama , verse and fantasy , loosely linked by the observations of the narrator , an American employee of a human_rights organization . Leslie Doyle has come_to Haiti to investigate the false_imprisonments , beatings and murders that have continued long after the death of the tyrannical &quot; President for Life &quot; Francois Duvalier and the exile of his corrupt and thieving son , Jean-Claude . Though her special mission is to document the outrages committed against the women of the country , she soon realizes that Haitian brutality is anything but gender-specific . &quot; Under The Bone &quot; begins with the story of a young peasant woman who discovers a corpse in the stream where she bathes . Innocent_of any connection to the dead man , she is nevertheless imprisoned ; her pathetic plight serves as a metaphor for thousands of similar cases . Haiti , like many Central and South_American_countries , has an invisible population : &quot; the disappeared , &quot; people who have vanished from villages and towns never to be seen alive again . Though Elyse Voltaire will escape death , her sufferings are explicit , extended and tragically typical . The stories of other women are presented in brief vignettes ; Elyse becomes the voice of the silenced . Like the author , Leslie Doyle lived_in Haiti as a child , the daughter of the American envoy . Her sojourn left her with an enduring love for the land and a knowledge of the Creole patois spoken by all , though the so-called &quot; elite &quot; use it only in private . Translated sentence by sentence for our convenience , that patois is sprinkled generously throughout the book , lending authentic flavor but impeding the pace of a narrative already slowed by didactic explanations of past events . As in any discussion of Haiti , questions of class and color loom large , and d ' Adesky confronts these sensitive issues unflinchingly . Though the dialect term blan ( white ) originally referred only to the white overlords , it has long been used to describe anyone with power or wealth , regardless of color . A black general can be blan , the self-indulgent descendants of French colonists and slaves are blan , and so are all foreigners . Depending_upon the context , the word can be either a derogatory epithet or a neutral description -- a succinct way of distinguishing the shrinking group of &quot; haves &quot; from the vast majority of &quot; have-nots. &quot; While d ' Adesky has assembled a sizable cast of characters intended to represent various aspects of Haitian political and social life , each major figure is so laden with opinion and attitude that he or she tends to become merely a spokesperson for a particular point_of_view . Gerard , a lawyer who longs to be a playwright , offers the entire first act of an allegorical drama in which all_the actors are crows -- a sardonic Haitian version of &quot; The Parliament of Fowls. &quot; Dr. Sylvie , a compassionate physician , tries valiantly to improve the lot of her patients , but is forced to work within the limits of a bankrupt system . &quot; If you want to know how someone died , &quot; she says , &quot; you can usually find_out through an autopsy . But if you want to know how they lived . . . you have to look somewhere else -- under the bone , &quot; a definition of the challenge also faced by the writer . A humanitarian priest , Father Emmanuel , struggles to reconcile his activist impulses with the constraints imposed by his vows . A troubled former army_officer must deal simultaneously with the burden of his past and the realities of the present . Cedric , a political activist central to the story , never appears in_the_flesh , though the search for him reinforces the image of a country where those who oppose the regime do so at the risk of their lives . Background is supplied by the shadowy figures of the extravagant and frivolous upper_class disporting themselves as if Haiti were their private fiefdom to be plundered at whim , their luxurious lives in stark contrast to the wretchedness surrounding them . At home_in the lush but depleted land , intellectually and emotionally involved with Haiti ' s tragic plight and thoroughly familiar_with the customs of the country , the author creates a vibrant setting for her panorama of human misery , but as in many murals , the individual figures in &quot; Under The Bone &quot; are painted with the literary equivalent of a broad brush .</TEXT>
