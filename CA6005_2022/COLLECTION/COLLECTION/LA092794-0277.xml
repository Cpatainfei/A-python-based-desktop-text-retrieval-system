   <TEXT> The career path to Cabinet posts and boardrooms in Latin_America increasingly leads through foreign education -- especially U.S. universities . The last three Chilean treasury ministers have been graduates of U.S. schools . In Mexico , both President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his predecessor , Miguel de la Madrid , attended Harvard . The new generation that will lead their countries into the next century is made_up of scholars like Colombia ' s 28-year-old vice minister of foreign trade , Mauricio Reina , who is a Johns Hopkins graduate . The common experience of attending U.S. graduate_schools has affected not only the Latin leaders ' perception of their former host country , but also the way they relate to each other . &quot; There is a broad consensus on certain key issues , a shared vision , &quot; said Terry McCoy , director of the Center for Latin_American Studies at the University of Florida in Gainesville . &quot; Not only do you know somebody , but you share a world view. &quot; That shared view , experts say , is a major reason why the latest initiatives at closer relations in the Americas -- starting with the North_American Free_Trade Agreement -- appear to be succeeding where the Kennedy Administration ' s Alliance for Progress and FDR ' s Good Neighbor Policy failed . Some caution is necessary , including the danger of exaggerating how much two years in the rarefied atmosphere of a top university really teaches a foreign student about U.S. culture . Still , whether government officials , business_executives or scientists , Latin_Americans eager for career advancement are coming under growing pressure to earn a foreign degree . &quot; We expect that if someone earns a doctorate here , he will go_to a foreign university for a post-doctorate , &quot; said Marcos Moshinsky , a noted Mexican physicist . In government , the incentive is clear : 59 % of Mexico ' s current Cabinet_ministers , undersecretaries and chiefs_of_staff did postgraduate work abroad , compared to one-fourth two decades ago . As a result , more_than 3 # 000 students from Mexico are now studying in the United States . That is a remarkable contrast from the level two generations ago when only the wealthiest Latin_Americans could aspire to a foreign degree . The change occurred largely because Latin_American governmental agencies -- mainly central_banks -- began offering graduate fellowships to bright young bureaucrats in the early 1960s , principally in economics . One of the best investments Venezuela made with its oil bonanza is considered to be the money put into fellowships for foreign study . The foreign-trained economists went_into government and onto university faculties when they returned home . At first , the young_Turks faced an uphill battle in their efforts to introduce free-market economic reforms , said Sergio Ghigliazza , director of the organization of Latin_American central_banks and a Yale graduate . Then the Third_World debt crisis of the 1980s discredited the old economic_theories at_the_same_time that foreign-educated economists were reaching the point in their careers that they could have a significant influence on public policy . University of Chicago graduates turned Chile into a laboratory for the monetarist theories of their mentor , Milton Friedman . &quot; Yale probably exerted more influence over economic_policy in Mexico than any other foreign institution , &quot; said Roderic Camp , a Tulane University professor who has compiled a biographical dictionary of influential Mexicans . The governor of Mexico ' s central_bank , a former treasury minister and President-elect Ernesto Zedillo , who is also a former budget minister , are among the key figures in the Mexican government who attended Yale . Throughout Latin_America , foreign-trained economists began negotiating the debt deals that included economic adjustments with the free-market reforms they had been advocating all along . At the same time , young executives whose corporations and families had sent them to the United States for MBAs began taking_over businesses . The result was a radical change of view about how government , businesses and countries in_general should be run . &quot; Based on hundreds of interviews , I can say that Mexicans in_general feel that education played a critical role in their values , not only the books they read , but their contacts with students and professors outside the classroom , &quot; Camp said . Colombian sociologist Agustin Lombana recalled his graduate study at Stanford as crucial to his view of life . &quot; I thought I was going there to obtain formulas to use for the rest of my professional_life , &quot; said Lombana , who now represents the Fulbright program in Colombia . &quot; Instead , I was left with a series of questions . After five months at Stanford , I felt overwhelmed by research in a field that I thought I had mastered . This shook me out of static thought into dynamic thought. &quot; That sort of experience is why graduate study abroad has affected Latin leaders so profoundly , he said . &quot; You can easily access the Harvard library on Infonet , &quot; Lombana explained , &quot; but that is not the same as living the reality of a foreign culture. &quot; However , Wayne Cornelius , director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego , cautioned that the reality for foreign graduate_students is often quite insular . &quot; They come_to the United States to acquire a tool_kit that will enable them to advance professionally back home , &quot; he said . &quot; That doesn ' t necessarily translate into a better understanding of the United States. &quot; In fact , he added , &quot; what they could have learned by osmosis may actually be quite wide of the mark. &quot; Most of the potential Latin leaders who have attended the San Diego center ' s summer seminar in U.S. studies over the last six years had already completed graduate work in the United States , Cornelius added . Nevertheless , he said , &quot; it ' s always very interesting to me to see the scales falling from the eyes as people find they harbor a set of stereotypes they weren ' t aware of until they began a rigorous course of academic work. &quot; However , Arcadio Diaz-Quinones , former director of Latin_American studies at Princeton , is worried that the young Latin scholars also become alienated from their own culture . &quot; This creates an international professional culture that allows_for understanding between ( leaders in different ) countries , &quot; he said . &quot; But they end_up talking to each other , not the people they represent . &quot; There is a danger of establishing a new elite , &quot; he said , &quot; of widening the gap between the elite and the people. &quot; If Diaz-Quinones is right , there is a scramble among Latin_American students to make_sure they land on the elite side of the gap by studying abroad .</TEXT>
