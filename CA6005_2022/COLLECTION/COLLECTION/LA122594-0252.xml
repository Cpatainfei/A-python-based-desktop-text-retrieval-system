   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA PLANES CONTINUE ATTACKS ON GROZNY ; CHECHNYA : THE FIFTH STRAIGHT DAY OF BOMBING COINCIDES WITH THE ANNIVERSARY OF MOSCOW ' S AFGHAN INVASION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Moscow ' s warplanes struck the devastated capital of Chechnya on Saturday as Russians marked the 15th anniversary of another invasion that scarred and divided the nation -- the war in Afghanistan . &quot; You can see the shadow of the Afghan War in Chechnya , &quot; Izvestia columnist Teimuraz Mamaladze wrote . As Russian warplanes bombed Grozny , the capital of the breakaway Chechen republic , for the fifth straight day , Russian ground forces appeared to be tightening their noose around the city . Nine miles east of Grozny , Russian artillery pounded the town of Argun as terrified residents tried to salvage belongings from their devastated homes . As his capital lay_in ruins , Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev told Associated Press Television that &quot; no army in the world , no military_force , could carry_out the Russian government ' s objective to break the spirit and freedom of the Chechen people . &quot; It is our genetic trait given by God , &quot; he said . &quot; It is impossible. &quot; Dudayev sat at a desk in a basement office in the presidential palace in Grozny illuminated by a single candle . Above were empty corridors , empty rooms and shattered glass . The palace was deserted except for guards outside . The Russian government continued to insist it was hitting military targets . The media continued to defy its efforts at spin control . Newspapers were both angry and elegiac as they compared the invasion of Chechnya , a small , mostly Muslim region of southern Russia , to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , which Moscow occupied for 10 years . &quot; Newspapers started writing the truth about the Afghan War 10 years after it started , &quot; the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said . &quot; As for Chechnya , there is a chance to write the truth right now. &quot; Izvestia disagreed : &quot; We didn ' t know the truth then . We don ' t know the truth now. &quot; But , it added , &quot; in 1979 people kept silent , hiding their tears . Today nobody hides their feelings about the events in Chechnya. &quot; The Kremlin says it is fighting to keep the Russian Federation together . But the invasion is fiercely unpopular . Even President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s staunch allies bitterly criticize the brutal attempt to crush Chechnya ' s independence . Chechen officials say hundreds of people have died since Russia invaded Dec . 11 . Saturday ' s pre-dawn air strikes destroyed several buildings in Grozny , television crews returning from the battered city said . Among the buildings reduced to burning rubble was the city ' s main toy store , Children ' s World . There was no information on casualties . But at midday , bodies still lay on the streets . An old_woman sat weeping outside the ruins of her home , the bodies of her son and his wife still trapped inside . * Russian troops have been moving toward the rebel capital from the west and south , but Chechen resistance remained stubborn . Russia ' s Independent Television reported Saturday that more troops were heading for Chechnya . An aide said Yeltsin , who underwent nose surgery Dec . 10 , plans to spend several more days recuperating at his dacha outside Moscow . Yeltsin was , however , planning to confer Monday with his Security_Council , a driving force behind the Chechen war .</TEXT>
