   <HEADLINE> ON THE ISSUE : INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY ' S TOPICS ; SHOULD MOTOR VOTER LAW BE IMPLEMENTED ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson filed a lawsuit against the federal_government Tuesday in an attempt to stop the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 from taking_effect in California until Washington has financed the cost of its scheduled Jan . 1 implementation . Commonly known as the motor voter bill , the new law would allow citizens to register to vote when they apply for a driver ' s license , welfare or other public assistance . At least two other public agencies , such_as libraries and public_schools , would also be designated by the state Legislature as locations to register new voters . Long sought by Democrats as a means to expand the national voter pool , the motor voter law is aimed at attracting largely disenfranchised groups such_as minorities and youths back into the political process . Wilson and his supporters contend that the federal_government is unconstitutionally imposing new costs and duties on states without the money to pay_for them . Estimated costs for the law ' s implementation range from $ 5 million to $ 35 million a year . Should the motor voter law be implemented in California ? Harold Ezell , co-author of Proposition 187 and chairman of the Voter Fraud Task_Force &quot; If we don ' t first reform the California election system , motor voter will be disastrous . It does not do a thorough job in identifying who that person is who will suddenly register to vote . I ' m not against making_it easier for people to vote , but the problem is that , if you don ' t require that an I.D. be shown_up front , the dogs , cats and 2-year-olds can still vote . The privilege to vote should not be given_away carelessly . Under the current system , you can almost become automatically registered without even a citizenship status check . Just because someone is qualified to have a driver ' s license doesn ' t make him qualified to be a voter . There ' s a better way than to get people registered at the welfare office . Is that where you want to register people ? &quot; Max Hobbs , president of the Verdugo Hills Democratic Club &quot; If it goes_through , we would be a better democracy . The more people you get_to participate in the system , the better the democratic process is in our country . If somebody wanted to abuse the system that badly , there are many ways to do that . Those sorts of things will happen from time to time and the people who do that should be prosecuted . But this is a democracy and people should remember that . This measure was passed_by both houses of Congress and some of them were Republican . If they wanted to block it , they could have filibustered it . Now , it ' s the law. &quot; Mark Di Camillo , director of the California Field Poll &quot; The public is somewhat unpredictable in their voting practices , so it ' s merely speculation as_to what impact any change in registration laws would have . One positive advantage is that since people have to , at various intervals , re-register , it would probably update some of the old address listings that are_on file_in the register rolls . We can also do &quot; hard purges , &quot; which means that people who are registered at an address they are no longer living at would be struck from the list if they failed to respond ( to government mailers. ) What Wilson is doing is a further way of avoiding to make the rolls more accurate. &quot; Janene Baluntac , legislative analyst for Assemblywoman Paula Boland &quot; No one can determine to what extent the measure would increase efficiency or voter_turnout . What the focus should be is that we ' re putting a bigger financial strain on California . That will impact everybody . More money will be taken_away from parks , schools , libraries and other vital services. &quot;</TEXT>
