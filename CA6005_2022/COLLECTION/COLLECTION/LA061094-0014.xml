   <TEXT> NEW ROUTE : Every Fourth_of_July for the past 68 years , Santa Clarita has had a parade -- and it has followed the same route . But there ' s nothing like Mother Nature to break tradition . Thanks to the Jan . 17 earthquake , the parade will take a slightly different route this year ( B9 ) . . . . Still , it has a glorious past . Ex-grand marshals include Hoyt Axton , Montie Montana , Claude Akins and Cliffie Stone . FEELINGS : The quake , of course , affected psyches as well as parades . At Tarzana Elementary School , for instance , students expressed their feelings in therapy groups . On Thursday , more_than 100 celebrated their &quot; graduation. &quot; . . . &quot; It ' s the responsibility of the adults to help the child understand what ' s transpired , &quot; said Suzanne Silverstein of the Psychological Trauma Center at Cedars-Sinai ( B1 ) . NEW CLOTHES : There will be a definite fashion statement this fall at La Mesa Junior_High_School in Santa Clarita , and everybody will be making_it . The school will become the first in the area to require uniforms ( above ) . . . . Paula Olivares , head of the school district ' s board of trustees , says research shows that students in uniforms have &quot; increased learning and better test scores &quot; ( B9 ) . HOLY COW ! Forget about Billy Crystal and Jack Palance . &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; opens today ( F1 ) , and that means the return of Norman . He ' s the adorable cow who certainly knew how to milk every moment of his screen time in the original . . . . Norman , who lives_in Canyon Country , apparently hasn ' t let fame go_to his head . &quot; He ' s the same Norman , &quot; said his trainer , Carol Sonheim .
