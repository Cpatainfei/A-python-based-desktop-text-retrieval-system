   <HEADLINE> GANG SWEEP IN SAN CLEMENTE NETS 34 ARRESTS ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : SHERIFF ' S DEPUTIES SAY THEY SURPRISED GROUP THAT WAS FIGHTING AND DRINKING AFTER GETTING A TIP ABOUT AN INITIATION PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what investigators called the largest gang sweep in South County , 34 suspected gang members were arrested following an initiation party near a remote park , authorities said . Orange County sheriff ' s deputies , who had been tipped-off about the meeting , surprised the group Thursday night and began making arrests , Lt . Dan Martini said Friday . The suspects -- 11 of them juveniles -- were arrested at a police roadblock near the park on suspicion of fighting in a public place and conspiring to engage in street terrorism . &quot; We invited ourselves to the party and arrested everyone , &quot; Martini said . &quot; It is our statement for the summer . We are not going_to tolerate this activity and this is the kind of reaction that the gangs can expect from us. &quot; Authorities said that the young_men arrested are suspected members of the city ' s largest street gang , which has an estimated 60 active members . Deputies arrived_at a private field next to Rick Steed Memorial Park about 9:50 p.m. and saw members of the group fighting and drinking , said sheriff ' s investigator Paul D ' Auria , who joined the sweep . &quot; We observed about five physical fights between several members of the group , &quot; D ' Auria said . &quot; Based on our experience , we recognized this as a way of initiating new members. &quot; D ' Auria said the initiation consisted_of members of the group surrounding the potential new member and &quot; jumping in , &quot; or beating and fighting with the recruit . Deputies arrested the group without incident as they drove from the party on Avenida Pico . There were no weapons recovered at the scene , Martini said . All but two of the 34 people arrested were identified by authorities as active gang members or gang associates . Arrested were : Balfred Brito , 20 ; Alfredo Aguilar Cabrera , 18 ; Alejandro Carrillo , 22 ; Abel Sanchez Diaz , 18 ; Raymond Diaz , 20 ; Raul Pera Flores , 20 ; Raul Gonzales , 19 ; Marcio Garcia Guerra , 23 ; Ramiro Ochoa Llamas , 23 ; Juan Carlos Llamas , 23 ; Sergio Aguilar Martinez , 19 ; Juan Gabriel Mejorado , 24 ; Adolfo Diaz Murillo , 18 ; Charles Mark Salazar , 21 ; Brett Raymond Sansom , 19 ; Juan Francisco Vasquez , 20 ; Alejandro Enrique Villa , 23 , and Oscar Enrique Gonzales . All are residents of San Clemente . Also arrested were : Robert David Aguilera , 19 , of San Bernardino ; Juan Manuel Banda , 19 , of Santa Ana ; Guillermo Palacio , 19 , and Loreto Trujillo , both of Capistrano Beach . The adults were being held at County Jail and one was booked at Anaheim City Jail for a parole violation . Three of the juveniles were taken_to Orange County Juvenile Hall and eight others were released to their parents with criminal complaints to be filed , Martini said . Six of the arrestees were_on parole or probation , Martini said . The sweep was organized through a special gang enforcement unit from San Clemente , with the help of deputies throughout South County and other law_enforcement agencies , including parole and probation_officers . Sheriff ' s Lt . Tom Davis , chief of police services in San Clemente , said he couldn ' t predict how the sweep would affect gang activity in the city . &quot; But it does send a clear message to the gang members of this city that we as a community are involved in trying to put an end to its membership , &quot; Davis said . &quot; I know there ' s still going_to be problems and it ' s something we have to continually work on. &quot; Local concern about gang activity reached_a_peak in October when 17-year-old Steve Woods was fatally pierced through the head with a metal paint_roller rod during an altercation at a local beach . Six youths , alleged gang members or associates , were charged in the death . The death of the San Clemente High_School senior caused outraged San Clemente residents to hold meetings , marches and demonstrations to protest gangs and youth violence . Brito , one of those arrested Thursday night , initially was arrested in connection with the Woods attack but later was released because of lack of evidence . City officials on Friday praised the efforts of the Sheriff ' s Department . &quot; We have an attitude of zero tolerance for gang behavior , &quot; said Mayor Scott Diehl . &quot; This fits that philosophy . Hopefully , it will once again show those who are not involved in gangs that it ' s not a good lifestyle . It ' s a dead-end street. &quot;</TEXT>
