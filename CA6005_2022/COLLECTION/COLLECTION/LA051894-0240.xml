   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; FIRST PENSION ALLEGATIONS SPARK CONCERN ABOUT ' DIRECT PARTICIPATION ' PROGRAMS ; INVESTMENTS : THEY AREN ' T ILLEGAL , BUT USE CAUTION . SCRUTINIZE THE PROSPECTUS AND ALWAYS GET A SECOND OPINION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that First Pension Corp . in Irvine may have stolen or misappropriated as much as $ 124 million from its investors have heightened financial experts ' concerns about such &quot; direct participation &quot; programs . * Q : What did First Pension Corp . allegedly do wrong ? A : Before it declared bankruptcy last month , First Pension functioned as a pension_fund administrator , setting_up IRAs , Keoghs and other types of retirement accounts . The SEC has alleged that First Pension persuaded many of the clients to invest in trust_deeds offered through other companies that were operated by the same people who ran First Pension -- an apparent conflict_of_interest . The SEC also claimed that as much as $ 99 million of investors ' money was never invested in real_estate at all and that millions more may simply have been stolen by management at First Pension . * Q : What is a &quot; direct participation &quot; program ? A : In a typical direct-participation program , a brokerage_firm sells investment products that are controlled by the same people who run the brokerage . In this case , the SEC claims , the same people who owned First Pension were selling interests in pools of trust_deeds through a brokerage_firm they also controlled , VestCorp Securities . * Q : What ' s wrong with such an arrangement ? A : Legally speaking , nothing . Yet First Pension misled its investors by failing to disclose its connection to VestCorp . In addition , and far more seriously , the SEC alleges that First Pension ' s owners used VestCorp and other companies they owned to set_up an elaborate pyramid scheme to bilk thousands of consumers out of their money . * Q : If direct-participation arrangements aren ' t illegal , how come so many financial experts are wary of them ? A : Advisers often make larger commissions or bonuses for selling investments their own company or an affiliate offers than they would by selling products offered by other financial_institutions . This can encourage unscrupulous advisers to put unwitting clients into bad investments , or ones that don ' t match their financial objectives , just so the adviser or broker can collect a fatter paycheck . In addition , some experts warn that direct-participation programs make_it easier to defraud unwitting investors . &quot; You don ' t always get the normal system of checks and balances when only a_few people are running the whole show , &quot; said Elaine Cacheris , regional director for the SEC in Los Angeles . &quot; In this case , the fox was in_charge of the henhouse , and the investors were the chickens. &quot; * Q : Have there been problems with direct-participation programs before ? A : Yes . Prudential Securities ' highly publicized problems with some of its oil and gas partnerships is a prime example of the troubles these programs can cause , Cacheris said . And last December , a federal court-appointed officer agreed with the SEC that the defunct Brokers Investment Corp . in Woodland Hills had misused much of the estimated $ 109 million it raised for limited partnerships offered by a telecommunications firm with which it had close ties . * Q : How can I reduce the chances of getting ripped_off if I invest in a direct-participation program ? A : First , realize that most of these programs are legitimate and that any investment you make will carry risks . Have your financial planner or adviser justify all these risks and explain how it would meet your overall investment goals . Scrutinize the offering ' s prospectus , including the section on conflicts_of_interest . Always get a second opinion from a planner or adviser at another firm before you invest . * Q : How can I find_out more about my broker or the people who run the company that he suggests I invest with ? A : If you ' re dealing with investment brokers , you should call the state_Department of Corporations to see if they and the firm they work for are licensed and whether they have been the subject of disciplinary action in the past . If the investment you are considering involves real_estate , you can get similar information by calling the state_Department of Real_Estate . You can also get the names of individuals who own the company , as well as any company listed under the &quot; conflicts_of_interest &quot; section of the prospectus , by contacting the California secretary_of_state . You can also discover the disciplinary history of any brokerage_firm or sales representative by calling the National Assn . of Securities Dealers ' toll-free hot_line at ( 800 ) 289-9999 . * Q : What are the chances that First Pension investors will get all their money back ? A : Chances of a full recovery are virtually nil . Up to $ 124 million of the $ 350 million in assets of First Pension clients may have been lost . It will probably take several months and possibly even years to determine where the money went and then try to get what ' s left of it back .</TEXT>
