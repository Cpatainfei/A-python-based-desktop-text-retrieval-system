   <HEADLINE> REVISED SYSTEM FOR SMALL-LOT TRADES DECRIED AS UNFAIR ; ACCESS : SOME SMALLER TRADERS SAY THE PROPOSED CHANGE WOULD FAVOR BIG-TIME DEALERS . OFFICIALS SAY IT FAVORS STABILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Black Monday in October , 1987 , when the Dow Jones industrial average fell a record 508 points , none of America ' s major securities exchanges performed worse than Nasdaq . Rather than making markets as they were supposed to , many Nasdaq dealers simply stopped trading -- and stopped answering their phones , according to a presidential task_force appointed to look_into the crash . One result : Individual investors who wanted to sell before prices fell further couldn ' t . &quot; For many investors , both large and small , the over-the-counter market broke_down , &quot; the task_force report said . In the aftermath of the crash , Nasdaq undertook a big improvement designed specifically for small investors : a major enhancement of its computerized small-order execution system ( known as SOES ) , which completes trades automatically , without the need for a phone_call to a market maker . All market makers were required to participate in SOES . So for orders to trade up_to 1 # 000 shares at market_prices , investors essentially were guaranteed the right to buy or sell stock swiftly at the current quoted price . But SOES may soon be no more . The National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which operates Nasdaq , has already sharply scaled back the system . In January , it cut the maximum SOES order to 500 shares . And it is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to eliminate SOES altogether -- and replace it with a new system favored by Nasdaq ' s big market makers . * The NASD contends that the new N-Prove system would benefit small investors , giving them more of a shot at buying or selling stock at better than the quoted prices . But in letters to the SEC , many investors and professionals have said the benefits would be largely illusory . In the event of another crash , they say , it would be much less likely that small investors ' orders would be executed quickly by N-Prove . According to SEC sources , SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . agrees -- and is likely to try to force the NASD to make major changes . As now proposed , critics say the chief effect of N-Prove would be to allow market makers more freedom to duck small customers ' orders -- if the market makers do not think they can make a profit on the trades . And SEC officials who have evaluated the N-Prove plan say it would ensure that market makers -- not customers -- get first crack at the best orders , officially sanctioning a practice known as &quot; trading ahead &quot; ( or &quot; front running &quot; ) that the SEC says should be banned . The Justice_Department confirmed this week that it has launched an antitrust investigation of Nasdaq , which since the 1987 crash has grown_into the nation ' s busiest stock_market , an electronic bazaar where , on average , about 299 million shares trade daily . The NASD says allegations that market makers collude to fix prices are baseless , and it insists that the Justice_Department will reach the same conclusion . The threatened demise of SOES reflects conflicts rending the ranks of Nasdaq traders . When SOES was beefed_up after the crash , some small traders used it heavily . Their foes protested that these traders -- whom the NASD initially dubbed &quot; SOES bandits &quot; -- were picking_off market makers who were slow to update their quotes in rapidly changing markets . The dealers were said to be using SOES ' swift , automatic execution to reap quick profits at the expense of unwary market makers . For their part , the SOES traders argued they were staying within the rules , legally exploiting a system the NASD had created . * With the new N-Prove system , these pick-offs would not be possible . But critics , in comments filed with the SEC , contend that the plan would take_away protections for small investors at_the_same_time it punishes the SOES activists . The critics , including Jeffrey P . Ricker , a San Francisco-based consultant to institutional investors , note that N-Prove , unlike SOES , would give market makers an opportunity to reject trades . And it would allow a significant amount_of_time to elapse before an order is executed , during which the price of a stock could change substantially . Rather than an order being executed instantaneously , as under SOES , each market maker would have a chance to reject the order , allowing up_to 45 seconds to pass before the computer finally selected one against which to execute the order automatically . If all_the market makers said they were in the process of changing their quotes when the order came_in , the customer would get the stock at the new price , not at the quote posted when the order was entered . Michael F . Frey , president of A.J. Michaels &amp; Co. , a Hauppauge , N.Y. , trading firm that was among the SOES activists , notes that in a rapidly moving market , 45 seconds can be an eternity . &quot; Count_off 15 seconds and see how long that seems to you , &quot; Frey says . His point : 15 seconds is plenty of time for market makers to tap a_couple_of keys on their computers and change their quotes -- and thus enough time to ensure that an order is executed at a worse price . The NASD claims N-Prove will give small investors a much-improved chance to get prices inside the spread -- that is , better than the quoted bid or asked prices . * Customer orders to buy or sell stock at a specified price -- so-called limit orders -- would go_into the N-Prove computer . If an order came_into the system to sell at the going market_price and there was a limit order already in the system to buy_at a price higher than the market makers were offering , the lucky seller would be able to sell at the higher , better price . However , the customer who put_in the limit order would n ' t necessarily get_to buy the stock . that ' s because N-Prove would give the market makers first crack at matching the limit-order price . They would have 15 seconds to do so . So the small investor on the other side of the transaction -- the one who offered a better price to begin with -- might lose out_to the market makers . &quot; In essence , this rule is an incredibly blatant license for front running , &quot; Ricker objected in a letter to the SEC . In its proposal , the NASD said giving market makers the chance to run ahead of customer limit orders is necessary ; otherwise , it said , &quot; market maker profitability will suffer , &quot; potentially drying_up liquidity on Nasdaq . The NASD says liquidity -- a market ' s ability to absorb large trades with minimal impact on prices -- is one of Nasdaq ' s key virtues . Another criticism of N-Prove : Only limit orders from small investors would enter the system . So small investors would miss out on better prices being offered by big investors , including mutual_funds and other institutions , that execute their trades over other networks . And some individual investors say it is unfair that short_selling would be banned completely on N-Prove , as it has been_on SOES since January . Short_selling involves selling borrowed stock in expectation that the stock ' s price will soon go_down . If it does , the investor buys_it back at the new , lower price and pockets the difference . Short_selling is freely allowed to larger traders and market makers on Nasdaq -- and to all investors on the NYSE . * Why deny short_selling to N-Prove users ? Richard G . Ketchum , the NASD ' s chief operating officer , said there were too many abuses by the activist firms when short_selling was allowed on SOES . But Ronald Sudol , a retired engineer in New Jersey who spends much of his time trading small quantities of Nasdaq stocks , complains that the ban on short_selling is unfair . &quot; Market makers can play both sides , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re only allowed one side. &quot; * Series Reprints : A compilation of this six-part series on Nasdaq will be available from Times on Demand upon completion of the series ' publication next week .
