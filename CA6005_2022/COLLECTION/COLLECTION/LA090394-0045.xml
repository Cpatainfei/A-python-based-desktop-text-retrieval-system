   <HEADLINE> A CRISIS ON HOLD ; STATE PLODS ON DESPITE PULLBACK BY INSURERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the time came this week for the insurance industry to rally state lawmakers to alleviate the California insurance crisis , the crisis turned_up missing . Despite predictions that the pullback of big insurers from the state ' s homeowners and earthquake market would stymie home sales and cripple the economic recovery , it hadn ' t happened by the time the Legislature closed_up shop for the year on Wednesday . The industry , accordingly , had no luck securing passage of legislation that would have created a state-backed earthquake insurance pool to help insulate insurers against another Northridge earthquake -- or a worse one . &quot; It ' s tough trying to sell a future crisis , &quot; admitted Bill Sirola , spokesman for State Farm Mutual Automobile_Insurance , which , as the nation ' s largest homeowners carrier , took the lead in vainly pushing the earthquake pool idea in Sacramento . Besides the lack of a clear-cut emergency , other factors also contributed to the industry ' s inability to put its plans across . Those factors included the complexity of the issue , the lack of time to consider it and fears that a California solution would take pressure off Congress to pass federal disaster legislation . Insurers and officials such_as Marjorie M . Berte , Gov . Pete Wilson ' s insurance adviser , still fear the shoe will drop . For the moment , however , real_estate and escrow agents insist they have seen few if any sales scuttled because a buyer failed to secure insurance . Delays , yes ; busted deals , no . But if the crisis hasn ' t emerged full-blown , that ' s not to say that the Jan . 17 earthquake hasn ' t caused real problems . Today , earthquake and homeowners insurance -- particularly for new customers -- is harder to find and often less comprehensive and more expensive than it was last spring , before three-quarters of the state ' s insurers began restricting sales . Take Mark Green of Santa Monica , for example . He got a letter in the mail last June from his carrier , New Jersey-based Chubb Insurance Group , telling him his homeowners policy would not be renewed because his house was built before 1945 . Chubb , of course , had known the age of the house when it renewed his policy the previous seven times , but that was before Northridge . Facing an Aug . 24 expiration date -- Chubb gave him a month ' s extension at no cost -- Green scrambled to get his 1925 home retrofitted . Some carriers will insure old homes if they ' ve been bolted to the foundation , for example . But Green still couldn ' t find a conventional insurer to take his business , so he was forced to buy a fire and earthquake policy from the California Fair Plan , the industry-sponsored insurer of last_resort . Historically , the Fair Plan has sold its bare-bones fire_insurance in brush-fire zones that regular companies consider too hazardous to write . Last June , however , as major carriers such_as State Farm , Allstate Insurance Co. , Farmers Insurance Group and 20th Century Insurance Co . were restricting their writings of new homeowners and earthquake insurance , Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ordered the Fair Plan to extend its coverage area statewide . Fair Plan policies don ' t include liability coverage and other features found in most homeowners policies , so Green had to find a &quot; wraparound &quot; policy to fill_in the gaps . He ended_up paying substantially more -- without even including the money he spent on retrofitting . &quot; It ' s not so_much that I ' m mad at Chubb as at the industry , &quot; Green said . &quot; I don ' t feel they ' re really taking_care of their customers. &quot; A comprehensive policy that used to cost $ 1 # 000 a_few months ago can cost three times that today , said Trish Halfacre , an independent agent in West Los Angeles . Several times , she has had to cobble_together coverage from the Fair Plan plus one or two specialized -- and expensive -- carriers such_as Lloyd ' s of London to replace a conventional homeowners policy . And even those with current homeowners policies have often been unable to increase their coverage limits or add earthquake coverage , Halfacre said . &quot; I feel sorry_for people trying to find coverage , I really do , &quot; she said . Despairing of any legislative solution and fearful of Northridge II , the sequel , Dallas-based Republic Insurance Co . last week became the first sizable company to announce that it would withdraw from California rather than simply declare a moratorium on new sales . One bill that did emerge from the Legislature this week would empower the governor -- upon a finding by the insurance commissioner that an availability crisis exists -- to prevent insurers from terminating or refusing to renew policies . Garamendi is urging Wilson to sign the bill . However , Berte , Wilson ' s adviser , said the legislation presents &quot; philosophical problems &quot; in that it orders a private company to sell a product . &quot; This is not a public_utility we ' re talking_about , &quot; Berte said . With the Legislature through for the year , Garamendi is planning to jump into the breach . He has scheduled hearings for Sept . 28-29 in San Francisco on earthquake rate increase applications filed by numerous carriers . At the same time , Garamendi -- whose term ends in January -- will try to develop his own solution to the availability problems , an approach that may involve using the Fair Plan as a vehicle for a stand-alone earthquake insurance pool . The issues are complex , Garamendi ' s chief spokeswoman said , so he will proceed deliberately . Meanwhile , some consumers are waiting . Said Green , the Santa Monica homeowner : &quot; It ' s sort of a small crisis , but not for people that are stuck_in it. &quot; Insurance Aftershocks Predictions of an &quot; insurance market meltdown &quot; in California following the Northridge earthquake have yet to come true . But the aftershocks continue , as the following chronology shows : Jan . 17 : Northridge earthquake , magnitude 6.8 , jolts Los Angeles . Early estimates of insurance losses approach $ 2 billion . April 7 : Official insured loss estimate jumps to $ 4.5 billion . April 20 : 20th Century Industries posts record $ 256-million first-quarter loss , wiping_out more_than half its capital , on estimated quake claims of $ 475 million . May 24 : 20th Century , at its annual meeting , says losses may force it to go_on the sales block . June 9 : 20th Century strikes a deal with the state allowing it to stop selling earthquake insurance and wind down its homeowners insurance business . June 16 : Farmers Insurance Group , No . 3 in California , stops selling new homeowners and earthquake policies . June 21 : Market leader State Farm warns of a &quot; looming crisis &quot; and proposes creation of a state-backed earthquake insurance pool . It also continues tightening restrictions on sales . June 22 : Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi orders the California Fair Plan to extend its limited fire and earthquake coverage statewide . June 30 : No . 2 Allstate suspends new sales of homeowners and earthquake policies . July 7 : Garamendi begins holding private meetings with insurers , consumer advocates and others to seek a solution . July 15 : Farmers moves to hike deductibles on earthquake policies to 25 % . Aug . 18 : California Supreme Court upholds Proposition 103 regulations , clearing the way for rebates of up_to $ 1 billion -- more_than $ 100 million of which is owed by 20th Century , whose estimated quake claims are now $ 685 million . Aug . 29 : Republic Insurance Co . announces withdrawal from California . Aug . 31 : Legislature adjourns without passing industry-sponsored bills to create an earthquake insurance pool . Quake loss estimates now exceed $ 7 billion .</TEXT>
