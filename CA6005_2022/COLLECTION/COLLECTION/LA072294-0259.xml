   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN : LADIES AND GENTEEL-MEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dance cards dangling from dainty wrists , the ladies flirted from behind their fans with gentlemen in spats , cravats and cutaways . Tonight , every woman could be a demure romance novel heroine , every man a dashing swain . They waltzed to &quot; The Blue Danube &quot; and bowed and curtsied through a quadrille . To &quot; Yellow Rose of Texas , &quot; they rollicked through a Virginia_Reel . Come Monday , it would be back to the future . In their dress-for-success clothes , they ' d return to their 9-to-5s . But this was Saturday and the Social Daunce Irregulars , whose sole raison d ' etre is to preserve the music , dance and customs of the Victorian Era , were having their thrice-yearly Grande Ball . Here , &quot; The men treat the women with respect and the women treat the men with respect , which is something you don ' t get_out on the street anymore , &quot; said Gail Selinger of Van Nuys , an office temp and regular Irregular . Prompting the dances was silver-haired dance master Professor Desmond . Just Desmond . &quot; It ' s like Mickey_Mouse . You don ' t know what his last_name is , &quot; Desmond said . The prof , who lives_in a Civil War-era house in Golina , Ill. , is a dance historian who taught a &quot; terrified &quot; Matthew Broderick to waltz in &quot; Glory. &quot; The man in the red tartan kilt was Jason Evans , 23 , a Pasadena graduate_student . The kilt , he explained , &quot; was the rage of Great Britain &quot; in the mid-1860s . &quot; Queen Victoria loved her Highlands. &quot; His wasn ' t off the rack at Harrods . He made_it and &quot; there ' s not a machine_stitch in it. &quot; The Irregulars take their Victoriana seriously . As Carolyn Kinkead of Pasadena , an MTA marketing secretary , said : &quot; You know you ' re in_trouble when you look in your closet Monday morning and there are five ball_gowns hanging there but you don ' t have anything to wear to work. &quot; Kinkead wore her gold velvet and brocade copy of a design by Charles Worth , an Englishman who was the father of haute_couture . Her escort , Fred Louaillier , was less authentic . His striped pants were the ones he ' d worn to wed his ex-wife ; his cravat hid the turned-under collar of his modern shirt . Although many are sticklers for authenticity , the Irregulars won ' t faint if you show_up in a converted prom gown that zips rather than laces . &quot; There ' s not an attitude , &quot; said Studio City psychologist Pat Roush . &quot; If you don ' t know the steps , you can still stay_on the floor. &quot; And , should a lady trod upon a gent ' s toe , Louaillier said , &quot; By definition , it ' s his fault . This is the Victorian era -- but remember , it means she can ' t vote , either. &quot; Both Rebs and Yanks were among the revelers . The Philadelphia Quadrille Band ( of L.A. ) played &quot; Battle Hymn of the Republic &quot; and &quot; Dixie. &quot; &quot; There go the candystripers , &quot; someone said wryly . This octet was hard to miss , the ladies in hoop-skirted awning-striped gowns -- a red , a yellow , a blue , a green -- the men in striped waistcoats . A bit of a &quot; side show , &quot; acknowledged Kate Morgenstern ( green stripes ) , an office manager from La Mirada . Morgenstern was corseted , but not boned : &quot; that ' s like wearing armor. &quot; Ray Herbeck of Hacienda Heights danced by , dashing in the blue and red of the Battalion of St . Patrick , a regiment of Irish who deserted the Army during the Mexican-American War and fought for Mexico &quot; in exchange for 300 Mexican acres . We were mercenaries. &quot; A writer / producer , he ' s doing a film on the battalion . His wife Ruth ' s lace bonnet labeled her as a married lady , circa 1840s . &quot; Of course , &quot; Herbeck said , &quot; she ' s about to become a widow because most of us who fought in St . Patrick ' s were hung. &quot; Pasadena architect Jeffrey Bissiri , president of the Irregulars and one of its founding_fathers six years ago , was a turn-of-the-century British infantry officer . &quot; We only exist to do this , &quot; he said . There are no regular meetings , thus the name . And daunce ? &quot; that ' s just an affectation. &quot; Why did 300 people , mostly youngish , turn_out for this event at the Pasadena Masonic Hall ? In this black-tie-optional world , Bissiri said , &quot; We ' re afraid to say , ' You have to wear your tux , damn it. ' People need that once in a while. &quot; Indeed , one man was heard to say that the ball was &quot; the most fun I ' ve had dressed. &quot; Portly David Springhorn came as W.C. Fields . Actually , he is W.C. Fields -- at Universal Studios , where he goes_about &quot; insulting you and kicking children. &quot; Springhorn -- seen waltzing with daughter Emily , 8 , a vision in crinolines and Keds -- is a devoted Irregular . In the real_world , he said , &quot; People have sort of lost the capacity to be beautiful. &quot; Still , said Professor Desmond , &quot; Charming as all this stuff is , I think we all would have hated to have lived_in those years. &quot; His high , stiff collar was killing him : &quot; You can cut your throat if you take a quick look around. &quot; The Poet and Charmer of Hollenbeck Home Cupping a hand to his ear , John Davis , poet_laureate of Hollenbeck Home , leaned forward , not wanting to miss a word . W.G. Heideman , executive_director of the retirement home -- and himself a bit of a poet -- was lauding Davis as a writer whose poetry &quot; flows over the paper like soft butter on warm toast. &quot; Residents of the Boyle Heights home had come_to its library to honor Davis who , at 103 , has become a published poet . &quot; This is your life ! &quot; said activity director Dennis Hiebert . Off came a drape veiling a permanent exhibit honoring Davis . &quot; Oh , is that us ? Wonderful ! &quot; said a stunned Davis . Stepping to the podium , he read , in a strong voice and without glasses , &quot; The Romance of the Sun and Sea. &quot; The poem , penned when he was 95 , was a third-place winner in an international contest held by the Maryland-based National Library of Poetry . &quot; Wow , that ' s amazing , &quot; said the library ' s Cynthia Stevens when told his age . His was among 3 # 000 entries chosen from 19 # 000 submitted for its new anthology , &quot; Tears of Fire. &quot; Davis , a former county roads department employee who never went_to high_school , is self-taught . He never sought to be published , until urged by Hiebert . He no longer writes -- &quot; I can ' t put my head together. &quot; But he wheels himself around the grounds , cheering on the shuffleboarders , chatting_up the ladies . As guests filed into a post-reading reception , the dapper Davis asked , &quot; Are we going_to another party ? &quot; * THE ROMANCE OF THE SUN AND SEA I saw the sun caress the sea , At twilight ' s trysting place , And faithful as in ages past , They met in_Love ' s embrace . Enwrapped within the ocean ' s arms , The sun had found its rest , And slept , with rosy-tinted smile , Beneath the ocean ' s breast . And while the sun slept through the night , In dreams of yesterday , The moon looked down with face aglow , Where sunbeams used to play . And far above the moon ' s fair face , The stars their silence break , To keep their vigil through the night , Until the sun doth wake . Now full of glory as before , The sun shines from above , And casts its smile upon the sea , Where first they fell_in_love . -- JOHN DAVIS</TEXT>
