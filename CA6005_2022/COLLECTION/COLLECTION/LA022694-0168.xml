   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE SAFETY ; DIARY OF A SHAKEN-UP HOMEOWNER , PART I : SURVEYING THE SCENE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although I ' ve written a number of articles about the value of earthquake-proofing a home , I ' ve always had a casual attitude about doing my own place . After all , I ' ve rationalized , our 68-year-old house withstood the Long_Beach quake of 1933 , the Northridge shaker of 1994 and every temblor in between . But my wife is besieged each time the ground rumbles by the nagging worry that next time will be our turn . And , truth be told , last month ' s quake did shake some sense into me . Like many people in Southern California , most of what we have is invested in our home and its contents . To lose the house or its furnishings would be financially crushing . To lose the irreplaceable objects that we have gathered around us in 22 years together -- our daughter ' s first oil_painting , our family photographs , the glass and ceramics we collect -- would be emotionally devastating . There ' s one other consideration as well . A survey of hospital emergency_rooms after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that rocked the Bay Area showed that most of the 1 # 200 quake-related injuries treated were caused when people were hit by books , mirrors , pictures , tall cabinets and other items in their homes . If anyone in my family was injured by falling objects that easily could have been secured , I ' d never forgive myself . So we ' re going ahead with our &quot; earthquaking &quot; project . I ' ll be keeping a log of material costs , time spent , problems and surprises encountered and ( we hope ) overcome : All are things I ' ll pass along in this and subsequent installments in hopes that what we learn will help you with your earthquake-safety projects . The first task in any earthquake-proofing project , and the subject of this report , is to walk through the house and garage and around the lot , inspecting the place to determine where the problems are and what has to be done . You can ' t get_down to the nuts-and-bolts business of securing your home and the things in it until you know what must be done . We made our inspection after discussing the process with Tom Carroll , president of AmeriSpec . The Orange-based company is the parent of a nationwide network of independently owned home-inspection businesses . Carroll has seen , or heard of , just about every twist and wrinkle there is . I was happily thinking that I only had to figure_out how to tie_down a water_heater and keep a_few heavy items from falling_off shelves . that ' s what most people think when they consider making their house quake safe : that everything they need to do is inside the main structure . But it isn ' t so , said Carroll , who pointed_out that I should also : * Look in my yard to see if there are power or telephone_lines that could be knocked_down by a falling tree or whipping branches . * Examine my garage to see what is stuffed into the overhead rafters that would fall on my head if I were inside when a big quake hit . * Consolidate all_the flammables in the house , garage and workshop into one or two areas away from doorways that might be used as escape routes . * Check the drainage around the foundation of the house to avoid post-quake leakage and water damage . * Check my fences to make_sure they are stable and would n ' t fall and injure anyone who happened to be in the back yard during a quake . After thanking Carroll for making the job a lot more involved than I ' d thought it would be , I drove_home , stood at the front curb , surveyed my domain -- and immediately spotted Job One . We have two telephone_lines into the house , and both pass_over the front_yard and through the middle of a shade_tree that has grown_up around them since I planted it five years ago . In a big quake , the tree would n ' t even have to fall to break the lines -- whipping branches would probably do the job . The tree will have to be pruned to make_way for the phone_lines . That will make_it more likely that we ' ll have phone_service after a quake . I got good marks from Carroll for my one piece of pre-Northridge quake-proofing : I not only know where my gas and electric meters are , I have attached a shut-off wrench to the gas_meter and showed my wife and daughter how to use it to turn_off the gas supply if that becomes necessary . But as part of the current quake safety effort , I am also going_to make_sure they know that the thick wire crossing over the driveway in front of the garage is the 240-volt service line for the house and that they should stay clear of it if it were to break and fall to the ground in a quake . ( A 240-volt jolt isn ' t terribly dangerous , but why take chances ? I ' ll also make_sure our daughter knows that there are high-voltage wires across the street ; they ' re the ones that are in the top row on most utility poles . Don ' t mess with them if they fall , because they do carry enough juice to fry a person. ) I ' m not worried about the location of our service line , but if it passed_over a doorway or a main route out of the house , I ' d probably call the electric_company and ask that it be rerouted . A spokesman for Southern California Edison said the utility will respond to such requests and will attach the service line at a new location on the house or garage . The homeowner , however , is responsible_for getting the power_line from that new attachment point to the electric meter , a process that would probably involve hiring an electrician and getting a city electrical permit and inspection . My other important outside chore will be to strap down the water_heater . We had it put_in its own little room at the back of the house when we added_on , so we ' re not worried about it falling_over and spilling water inside the house in an earthquake ; the concern is that a falling water_heater can rip loose the gas_line that feeds it and ignite a fire . Fires from broken gas_lines can cause nearly as much damage as a quake itself -- more if firefighters can ' t get_around_to knock_down the flames . There is one major earthquake-proofing task I ' m not sure I ' ll pursue : bolting my house to its foundation . Because our house was built before the building_codes were changed in the aftermath of the Long_Beach earthquake , our house is not fastened to its foundation -- except in back , where we added_on when we bought_it in 1987 . Instead of bolting the frame to the foundation , as has been the practice for 60 years , builders of pre-1933 residences in Southern California typically laid the mud sill directly on top of the foundation , worked_up from there and trusted that the weight of the structure would keep it from sliding around . I ' ll check_out what needs to be done and how much it will cost to do_it before making a decision on that project . We ' re lucky so far as other outside inspection points go : We don ' t have a heavy block wall that could fall_over and injure people ; our lot slopes nicely away from the foundation of the house , so we would n ' t have a drainage problem , and while our stucco-coated brick chimney could tumble in a big quake , it is built entirely on the outside of the house . That means it is unlikely that falling brick would crash through the living room ceiling . If you ' ve got a masonry chimney that goes_up into your attic and then through the roof to the outside , Carroll and several builders suggest nailing plywood sheets to the beams in the attic to make a solid floor all around the chimney . That way , if it did crumble , the bricks would be stopped by the plywood and would n ' t crash through the plaster or drywall ceiling and brain someone in the room below . The fix for a block wall isn ' t quite so easy : If you ' ve got a masonry wall , test it by grabbing the top at one end and shaking . If the wall doesn ' t wobble , it ' s probably OK . If it does , you have three choices : ignore it and hope for the best ; tear it down and have a new one built , or have a contractor install pilasters -- masonry buttresses -- all along its length to strengthen it against toppling in an earthquake . Whatever you do , however , don ' t fill a hollow block wall with concrete or earth to strengthen it ; it will just make_it heavier and more likely to cause damage or injury if it falls . And don ' t try to install reinforcing rod -- rebar -- in an unreinforced wall . The rebar doesn ' t do any good unless sunk well into the foundation , so it has to be put_in when the wall is built . Retrofitting doesn ' t help much , Carroll said . After walking our lot and discovering that there isn ' t too_much I have to do outside the house to get ready for the Big One , I moved my attention inside and discovered that at least a full weekend ' s work awaits . Chores on the list : * Fixing latches_on the kitchen cabinets so they don ' t fly_open and dump our dishes and dry goods on the floor . * Securing the refrigerator so it doesn ' t roll_out of its alcove and spew its contents . * Fastening down the collectibles in our glass-shelved display_cases and the electronic gear in the entertainment cabinet . * Clearing flammables from our escape routes . * Fastening the entertainment_center to reduce the chances of it toppling and dumping our TV and stereo equipment . * Figuring_out a way to cushion our china , which isn ' t on display , and our antique cranberry glass stemware , which is . * Ensuring that bedrooms and bathrooms are quake-safe . That last should be an easy chore for us . Our decorating scheme avoids the use of such things as heavy mirrors and pictures that could fall on sleepers . And in a late-blooming mania for orderliness , I recently organized our closets with built-in shelving that moved all_the heavy items to floor level and left the upper part of the closets for lightweight things such_as sweater boxes and sleeping bags . My wife doesn ' t think I ' ll get halfway through it all_in a weekend , but I ' ve assured her that with some advance planning and a weeknight trip to the home improvement store to gather material in_advance , it ' ll be no sweat . On subsequent weekends I ' ll be attending_to more onerous but less pressing quake-safety tasks that include securing the storage boxes that line the back of the garage ; doing something to keep the tools adorning the walls of my shop from falling on my head if I happen to be working there when the San Andreas opens_up and finding a place to set_up an emergency food and water_supply center that we can get_to even if the walls fall_down . we ' ll keep you posted .</TEXT>
