   <HEADLINE> ASBESTOS RISK ADDS TO VICTIMS ' TROUBLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As president of an environmental testing firm , Michael Uziel usually deals with the toxic worries of others . But he ' s had serious ones of_his_own since last month ' s earthquake battered his Northridge home -- cracking the cottage_cheese ceiling and scattering asbestos dust over furnishings and carpets . &quot; It ' s devastating . . . I have to throw ( away ) almost all my belongings , &quot; said Uziel , 50 , who evacuated his house and may_not have enough insurance to cover both structural repairs and asbestos cleanup . Jolted by an asbestos aftershock , hundreds of building owners and occupants like Uziel are scrambling to deal with the risk of contamination from asbestos , a leading environmental cause of lung_cancer , along with extra cleanup costs and delays in getting their lives back to normal . Because of its widespread use in building_materials , asbestos &quot; is always an issue of concern whenever there ' s an event that damages structures , &quot; said Kathleen Shimman , regional director of the office of health and emergency planning for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . When earthquakes or hurricanes knock buildings around , asbestos &quot; can be shredded and broken and . . . the fibers of asbestos can be inhaled. &quot; In one form or another , asbestos is present in more_than half of all buildings that are at least 15 years old , authorities say . And while many uses of asbestos have been banned , some continued into the 1980s . Despite its fearsome reputation , asbestos is perfectly safe when intact . But when asbestos materials are pulverized or broken , they can release microscopic fibers that float like water_vapor and are dangerous to inhale . Health officials and asbestos consultants have been flooded with calls from those concerned about the problem . But they said many other building owners and occupants probably are unaware of quake-related damage to asbestos materials . Meanwhile , some homeowners , unwilling or unable to hire licensed asbestos contractors , are cleaning_up asbestos debris themselves -- with or without proper equipment and dust prevention methods . Even so , business is booming for the asbestos abatement industry , which is_on a short_list of businesses thriving in the wake of the Jan . 17 quake . &quot; Everybody in this industry -- consultant and contractor included -- have been taxed and maximized to the extent of capacity and beyond to cover all . . . work that ' s going_on , &quot; said Thomas A . Jordan , vice_president of Gale / Jordan Associates Inc. , an environmental consulting_firm . Although asbestos is typically out_of_sight in boiler rooms or attics , the quake showed how pervasive it is . In a number of large office_buildings , asbestos fireproofing from steel beams floated down through dislodged ceiling tiles to settle_on floors and desks , Jordan said . In several offices where his firm ran air tests , Jordan said these spills temporarily created significant airborne levels of asbestos . Other consultants and contractors said they also have been busy cleaning commercial buildings the quake left structurally sound but littered with asbestos . Typically , such cleanups involve misting the air to weigh_down floating asbestos dust , wet-wiping solid surfaces , and using special vacuum_cleaners with dense filters to capture the microscopic fibers -- which are so tiny they pass_through the bag of an ordinary vacuum . But Jordan voiced concern that other building managers -- overjoyed their structures were left standing -- didn ' t think to visually check asbestos materials for cracks and tears . &quot; In my opinion , there ' s a lot of buildings out there that have asbestos in them that had significant fiber release , but because they didn ' t have extensive structural damage they ( the owners ) are not aware of it , &quot; Jordan said . The quake and its aftershocks also triggered asbestos spills at about 100 schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District . Richard F . Henry , the district ' s asbestos technical supervisor , said that in preparing the schools for the return of students and staff , cleanup crews had to remove fallen asbestos soundproofing and pipe wrap and broken asbestos floor tile . In some areas , the problem has defied a quick_fix . For example , in the little theater area at El Camino Real High_School in Woodland Hills , asbestos debris from broken acoustical material is so extensive that the area has been temporarily sealed pending further work , Henry said . At Cal State Northridge , pulverized asbestos littered so_much of the engineering building that officials were forced to order a massive cleanup before they could get_in to assess quake damage , said Bill Chatham , CSUN associate vice_president for facilities and operations . Then , with the cleanup nearly complete after 10 days of wiping and vaccuuming asbestos debris , the big aftershock of Saturday , Jan . 29 , created a second asbestos blizzard . Said Chatham : &quot; They were wrapping_up and getting ready to shut_down operations , and Saturday it ' s full go again. &quot; Many houses and apartments have problems of_their_own -- including cottage_cheese or &quot; popcorn &quot; ceilings that in some cases contain at least a small percentage of asbestos . In some cases , the earthquake cracked or shattered these ceilings , dusting carpets and furniture below . That was the case at Michael Uziel ' s house , built_in 1977 , where asbestos was found not only in the ceiling but in plaster from cracked walls . Uziel , who has two children , moved_out , and alerted neighbors with homes of similar construction . A couple of the neighbors also moved_out , but some &quot; just shrugged it off , &quot; Uziel said -- taking the view that &quot; if it doesn ' t bite , and doesn ' t burn , it doesn ' t hurt you. &quot; &quot; I knew my responsibility to other people , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes you happen to know things that the average man doesn ' t. &quot; What Uziel does not know , however , is how he will take_care of structural repair and cleanup costs well in excess of his $ 100 # 000 earthquake insurance_policy . Asbestos insulation on ductwork has been another trouble area in single homes . When Jeff Prey called a private building inspector to the attic of his West Hills home to check on fallen roof beams , the inspector also found split ductwork and asbestos insulation -- raising a risk of asbestos fibers swirling through the ducts with each aftershock or wind gust through the vents . That , and the fact that Prey ' s 3-year-old sleeps next to the attic , was enough to send him packing . Long considered a leading environmental cause of lung_cancer , asbestos also has been linked to mesothelioma , a rare and nearly always fatal cancer that may appear up_to 40 years after initial exposure . Low levels of asbestos are always present in the air , due_to construction and demolition work and erosion from brake_linings and clutches . The vast bulk of asbestos disease has afflicted heavily exposed workers who labored for years in dusty conditions with minimal protection . But asbestos illness occasionally is reported in people thought to have been minimally exposed , prompting many experts to say no level is safe to breathe . When homeowners discover crumbling insulation or building fixtures , there usually is no way to know for_sure if it contains asbestos without a laboratory test . If broken asbestos is present in more_than minimal amounts , most experts advise homeowners to hire a licensed asbestos abatement contractor rather than attempt the work themselves . Still , experts say consumers should be_on the lookout for price-gougers and shoddy work -- which by scattering asbestos can do more harm than good . Dean Stratton , an official with Environ , an abatement firm with offices in Van Nuys and Hermosa Beach , said some contractors are charging a premium of 25 % above their normal rates . &quot; People are desperate to get_it ( the work ) done , and it may be weeks before they can get_it taken_care of by the company that gave them the best price , &quot; Stratton said . Still , consumers should compare bids from at least three contractors and check the license status before hiring a contractor , said Diane Lickar , who runs an asbestos abatement firm and is president of the Environmental Information Assn. , a trade group that provides referrals to asbestos consultants , contractors and labs . &quot; I have to tell you there are a lot of unethical contractors , &quot; Lickar said . &quot; The worst come_out at times like this. &quot; Owners of commercial and apartment_buildings are required to hire licensed contractors to perform asbestos abatement work . But homeowners are exempt from this requirement , and in some cases are doing cleanup and removal themselves -- although most experts caution against it . Los Angeles County health officials and the American Lung Assn . are responding to questions on doing simple asbestos cleanups . &quot; Usually people lack the funds to ( hire a contractor ) so we would tell them how to get literature to properly clean_up asbestos , &quot; said Don Thompson , an industrial hygienist with the county ' s health / hazardous materials control program . Regulations designed to limit asbestos dust in outdoor air have also been relaxed to speed clearance of quake rubble . In normal times , the federal Clean Air Act and South Coast Air Quality Management District rules require special precautions to keep asbestos from becoming airborne during building repairs or demolition . The rules require asbestos contractors to wet down and gently remove the asbestos before demolition occurs . But many quake-damaged buildings are too unstable for asbestos crews to enter -- and thus are being cleared with the minimal safeguard of wetting the rubble to reduce dust . This also means that rubble containing at least small amounts of asbestos is going_to area landfills that normally don ' t accept it . Said air district spokesman Bill Kelly : &quot; You have to make a trade-off between the problem of asbestos and the imminent public safety concern from these unstable structures. &quot; Asbestos Fallout Fallout from the Northridge earthquake can include contamination by asbestos , a substance used in many building products and a leading environmental cause of cancer . Although many asbestos uses have been banned , even structures built after 1980 may contain the substance . Asbestos materials are safe when intact , but -- when torn or broken -- may release harmful fibers into the air . * INDICATIONS Broken or crumbling fireproofing , acoustical insulation , pipe wrapping , floor tiles or ceiling material . * TESTS There usually is no way to know for_sure if material contains asbestos without a microscopic analysis . Laboratories charge as little as $ 15 per sample to test suspect materials , although a full home inspection -- including sampling , lab results and a written report -- could cost $ 200 . * CLEANUP OR REMOVAL When damaged asbestos material is present in more_than minimal amounts , most authorities advise homeowners to hire a licensed asbestos abatement contractor to clean_up or remove the material rather than attempt the work themselves . Experts say consumers should be_on the lookout for price-gouging and slipshod work -- which could scatter asbestos and do more harm than good . Consumers should compare bids from at least three contractors . Before hiring an asbestos abatement contractor , check the firm ' s license status and complaint history with the Contractors State License Board , which has regional offices in Glendale ( 818-543-4735 ) and Buena Park ( 714-994-7450 ) . Also , ask the contractor to show a current certificate of registration for asbestos-related work , issued by the state Division of Occupational Safety and Health . * GETTING ADVICE There are several sources of free advice on testing suspected asbestos-containing material , cleaning_up minor asbestos spills , and finding qualified asbestos laboratories and contractors . Among them : * Los Angeles County Department of Health Services , ( 213 ) 725-5055 . * American Lung Assn. , ( 818 ) 797-LUNG or ( 213 ) 935-LUNG . The Lung Assn . also offers a useful booklet , &quot; Asbestos in Your Home. &quot; * The Environmental Information Assn. , whose members include asbestos , lead and radon consultants , and abatement contractors , also refers consumers to licensed asbestos firms .
