   <HEADLINE> U.S. OFFERS ASSURANCES TO SOFTEN HAITIAN MILITARY ; CARIBBEAN : SOURCES SAY ARMY WON ' T BE CUT_BACK IF ARISTIDE RETURNS . APPARENT SHIFT IS AIMED AT REDUCING RESISTANCE TO RESTORATION OF THE EXILED PRESIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States is trying to weaken Haitian military resistance to the restoration of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide with assurances that the army will not be seriously cut_back nor will most senior officers be removed , diplomats and other sources here and in Washington say . This is a seeming shift from the recent American policy of seeking a substantial reduction in the 7 # 000-member army , its separation from the police and a total restructuring of both institutions . &quot; We still want to professionalize the military , and we will insist on a separate police , &quot; one U.S. official said , &quot; but we now think that if we can convince the military it won ' t be destroyed and the soldiers won ' t be thrown_out of work they might not follow Cedras and the others. &quot; He was talking_about the exceptions to the new approach : Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the regime ' s military strongman ; Gen . Philippe Biamby , the army chief_of_staff ; and Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , Haitian police commander . These men also led the 1991 coup that drove Aristide , Haiti ' s first democratically elected president , from office . Their resignations and departures are among demands made by the United States and the United Nations for ending the economic and political embargo strangling Haiti . Haitian military_leaders have effectively used fears about possible job losses and other punishments to maintain solidarity in their force . But some officials here said the seeming shift in tone and policy on this topic is designed to weaken the hold of senior officers ; one diplomat in Haiti called it the &quot; carrot of the carrot and stick &quot; approach . &quot; One day ( the Americans ) are issuing menacing statements about invasions , and the next day the military is told they don ' t have to worry if they cooperate , &quot; the diplomat said . Another official agreed , but noted that &quot; of course , this ( offer ) is not open-ended , and all bets are off if the military resists &quot; in the event the United States takes military_action to restore Aristide . * The comments about the military here also would seem , potentially , to constrain American policy here , particularly in_view of past assessments by senior U.S. officials in Washington and Haiti that they had been unable to find a senior or even mid-level Haitian officer who could be trusted to lead a restructured army . Speaking of what the army might expect after Aristide ' s restoration , one official said that other_than forcing a_few transfers , &quot; the rest can stay . That is all that the U.N. resolution calls for. &quot; He was referring to a May 6 resolution of the U.N. Security_Council demanding that the three top officers resign and leave Haiti in_order to restore Aristide , whom they overthrew in a coup Sept . 30 , 1991 . While it is true that the resolution discussed just those three officers and previous agreements had offered amnesty to the military , U.S. policy was to go beyond that narrow view . U.S. officials since have said they would seek a reduction and restructuring of the army , including removal of officers involved in criminal acts and human_rights violations . Besides , said one diplomat , referring to a failed agreement in July to restore Aristide , the Governors Island accord &quot; was abrogated by Cedras . We certainly don ' t have to live_by the provisions designed to help_out the man who reneged. &quot; Whatever the interpretation , most officials and sources interviewed shared the view that an attempt had to be made to create problems for Cedras inside the military . The Americans &quot; want to create as much dissatisfaction and dissension as possible in the ranks , &quot; one diplomat said . &quot; that ' s what the ship is for. &quot; He was discussing a ship-borne radio_station , authorized by President Clinton , to broadcast to Haiti . &quot; Well , &quot; said an official , &quot; you ' re right . The point of much of the broadcast will be to urge the troops to get_rid_of Cedras , Biamby and Francois and to assure them they will be safe and have jobs afterward. &quot; Even as these sources were speaking , many Haitians were speculating that a split was developing in the army and at the highest levels . The furor began Tuesday when Evans Francois , elder brother of the police commander , called a radio_station here from the Dominican_Republic , demanding that Cedras resign and stating that Michel Francois &quot; is ready to make concessions to save the nation. &quot; Michel Francois reacted overnight with a statement rejecting his brother ' s position and calling the demand for Cedras ' resignation &quot; offensive and inopportune. &quot; Diplomats and Haitian analysts split in their view_as to the significance of this development . &quot; It is serious , &quot; one Haitian political expert said . &quot; We know that Michel has been uncomfortable with Cedras and Biamby for a long time. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think it means anything other_than Evans is frightened , &quot; another source said . &quot; Anyway , you know that Evans and Michel had a falling_out over Governors Island and ( Evans ) has been out of the country most of the time since. &quot; Even as this situation was developing , there were renewed efforts to persuade Cedras to leave . This is being done with promises that he would lead a comfortable life in exile . A senior Administration official in Washington said he would find it &quot; fine &quot; if another nation offered exile to Cedras ; the United States would even help him leave . &quot; We ' re not negotiating anything &quot; because the Administration doesn ' t want to send &quot; mixed signals &quot; to either Cedras or to Aristide supporters , the official said . But when asked if any other nation was working_on exile arrangements with the general , the source answered : &quot; I can ' t say what anyone else might do . But if Cedras said he wanted to leave and wanted safe passage , what do you think we ' d do ? We ' d ask : ' Do you need a plane ? How can we help ? ' And we ' d say : ' Have a nice life. ' &quot; In Port-au-Prince , diplomats from countries likely to accept Cedras refused to comment , but some said privately that there have been talks_about the general ' s going_to France or Spain . While the American official ' s comments reflected previous agreements reached between Aristide and Cedras -- including amnesty in exchange for Cedras ' resignation and departure -- some Haitian analysts and diplomats saw the comments as exactly what the official claimed to be trying to avoid -- sending mixed signals . &quot; How do you convince someone as determined and hardheaded as Cedras that he should leave now , if at_the_same_time you ' re telling him he will be flown out_in comfort and allowed to keep his money and live_in luxury in Paris ? &quot; this source asked . &quot; Of course he ' ll stay until they come and take him away . What they should tell him is that he has X number of days to resign and get_out and that if he ' s still here when the troops come , he goes_to jail . He might understand that. &quot; * Freed reported from Port-au-Prince and McManus from Washington .</TEXT>
