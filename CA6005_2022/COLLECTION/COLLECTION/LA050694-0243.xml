   <HEADLINE> MY TURN : OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; LACK OF FAMILIARITY BREEDS RACISM AND HATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superman isn ' t the only one who could benefit from X-ray vision . In a world where people continue to judge each other on the basis of their skin_color , society might well wish more people had his eyes . Between May 1990 and May 1992 , there were 212 incidents of hate crimes in U.S. high_schools , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Ala . There are many forms of racism , but overt racism is manifested by prejudice and some kind of discriminatory act that is usually conscious , says Joseph Liu , professor of the Comparative Culture Department at UC Irvine . Caused by ignorance and fear of the unknown , this type of racism is perpetuated by stereotypes , according to Mary Ottman , an affirmative_action specialist at UCI . &quot; We ' re afraid of what we don ' t know . A lot of ( racism ) has to do with stereotypes , &quot; Ottman said . &quot; People extrapolate a situation from the media , like the riots , and they take those behaviors and apply them to the entire race of African Americans . So , in spite of the fact of the small number of people in an economically depressed area , we go_ahead and apply those behaviors to every black we come_into contact with. &quot; Because racism is a learned behavior , children will imitate how their parents act toward people and the way they hold themselves around other races , says psychologist Justo Corpuz of Houston . &quot; In a hypothetical world with no outside interference , if you put a black kid , a yellow kid , a brown kid and a white kid together , and they grow_up without anyone else ' s help , they ' re not going_to know any differences between themselves because they don ' t have any preconceived ideas of racism , &quot; Corpuz said . &quot; They don ' t know about hating people just because their hair is blond or their skin is dark . They ' re not going_to pick on each other because of physical attributes ; they will probably pick on each other for ideas they don ' t like . They ' ll show individual differences through their personality , how they think and how they create ideas. &quot; * An black student at Troy High_School in Fullerton said she felt the full effects of racism when she attended a wedding with her best_friend . &quot; Five people scrutinized me throughout the whole ceremony and reception , &quot; she said . &quot; I felt totally out_of_place because I was black . While I was standing_by the wedding_cake , a friend of Jane ' s uncle walked straight up_to me and said , ' Why are you here ? You ' re not wanted. ' I was so shocked that I couldn ' t say anything . I could feel that all eyes were_on me , and when I got home I was so upset that I just sat in my room and cried . &quot; I don ' t even know those people , and I ' ve never done any wrong to them , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t understand why they hate me because of the color of my skin . People are human , not colors , and it ' s sad to think people would judge others solely on their appearance . You ' re not born a racist ; you ' re taught to hate others. &quot; In order to stifle racism , schools need to introduce a course on multicultural education as early as first_grade , Corpuz said . &quot; It should be part of the curriculum to actually be able to accept and identify each other as people . As children , you don ' t have a white_person or a black_person ; you ' re all people . &quot; When kids are playing , it shouldn ' t be , ' Why don ' t you go play with that blond boy , ' &quot; Corpuz said . &quot; When you do that , you ' re subconsciously stereotyping people with their physical attributes . There ' s an underlying element of racism in saying that instead of saying , ' Why don ' t you go play with Jeff , ' who is a person that happens to be blond-haired and blue-eyed. &quot; * Learning about other cultures will significantly reduce racism and promote a universal understanding of all peoples , Ottman said . &quot; The best way to end racism is by fostering individual relationships with people from other cultures . Not just race ; I ' m talking_about lifestyle : gays , lesbians , bisexuals , religion , age , whether or not you ' re from Mexico or Puerto Rico . People should also share foods and customs with each other , because differences aren ' t bad. &quot;</TEXT>
