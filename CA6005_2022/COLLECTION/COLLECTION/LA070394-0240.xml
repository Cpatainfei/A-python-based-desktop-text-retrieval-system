   <HEADLINE> FRENCH ARMY COURSE AIMS TO TEACH REPORTERS HOW TO SURVIVE A WAR ; JOURNALISM : LESSONS INCLUDE HOW TO SPOT A SNIPER , FIRST_AID AND EVASION TECHNIQUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exploding grenades shake the air and machine_guns chatter . Journalists scramble through a smoky maze of blackened buildings , a sewer and passageways filled with tear_gas . &quot; There ' s gunfire over that wall ! Stay low ! &quot; one reporter yells to his colleagues . It is a surreal war zone atop a 19th-Century fortress overlooking this Mediterranean port near the Spanish border . It also is make-believe . In a three-day program at the_French army ' s National Commando Training Center , journalists learn how to adjust to warfare and avoid becoming statistics . Last year , 63 journalists were killed around the world , many in combat_zones , according to the_French organization Reporters Without Borders . &quot; A press card or white paint on a U.N. vehicle are no longer enough , &quot; said Lt . Col . Jean-Paul Legras , commander of the center . &quot; We want to show you little things that won ' t protect you , but will make you less vulnerable , &quot; Legras said in greeting the fourth class of the year-old program . &quot; This has nothing to do with ' Rambo. ' &quot; His center normally operates courses of two to four weeks for army_officers and French Legionnaires . The brief session for reporters includes avoidance of snipers , mines and booby-traps , lethality of weapons , first_aid and basic hand-to-hand evasion techniques . The only charge is about $ 60 to cover food . The French Defense Journalists ' Assn . asked the army for the program , similar to one in Australia . &quot; During the Gulf War , we had trouble working with the military , and Yugoslavia was an emerging war zone , &quot; said Stefan Ciezka , the association ' s treasurer . Much of the instruction involves common_sense , reminding everyone to be alert and resourceful . During sniper instruction , the class sat outside a two-story house while the trainer pointed_out possible sniper nests . &quot; The most likely spot is the roof , &quot; Lt . Michel Marzoc said . Then a commando sprang out through a skylight , submachine_gun blazing with blanks , startling the pupils . Look_out for any opening in a house , from a chimney to a ground-level vent , journalists are told . In a high-rise , the choice spot is an upper floor -- but not the top , an obvious target for sniper-hunters . Wear dull or dark clothing , but if you choose green , &quot; don ' t complain you were mistaken for a soldier , &quot; one instructor said . &quot; And don ' t carry army rations. &quot; Instructors showed how , through teamwork , two reporters could quickly pull each other through a window or drag a wounded comrade to safety . Using a smoke_bomb for cover , the victim clasps his hands around the neck of the rescuer , who crawls on all fours . When looking_for a hide-out , push open a door slowly because it could be booby-trapped , the soldiers warned . The journalists practiced , carrying a block of wood in the shape of a video camera . In a final test , students , alone or accompanied by commandos , negotiated a maze of buildings and alleys while soldiers shot blanks and exploded grenades at a safe distance . Reporters drove through a checkpoint manned by &quot; drunken &quot; fighters . The most chilling part of the course displayed mines , other booby-traps and slides of maimed victims . Millions of anti-personnel mines , which cost as little as $ 1.50 each and can look as benign as a tuna can , are scattered in current or former combat_zones around the world . First-aid techniques taught in the course include treatment for shock and bleeding , mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and making stretchers and splints from available materials . Students practice using hypodermic_needles on themselves . At the nearby Mont Louis commando base in the Pyrenees , the class watched commandos fire rifles , machine_guns and an antitank missile . Bullets went_through wooden blocks and hollow brick walls , but were stopped by sandbags , walls of poured concrete and , surprisingly , tightly bound stacks of magazines . By agreement with the journalists ' association , there will be at least one session in September and two more next year , Ciezka said . The training does not always instill confidence . A German TV cameraman who filmed it said the course &quot; reinforced my feeling never to cover a war zone. &quot;</TEXT>
