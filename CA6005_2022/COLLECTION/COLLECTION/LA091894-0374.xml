   <HEADLINE> MAGNET SCHOOL LOGS ON TO INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY ; EDUCATION : STUDENTS CAN SURF THE INTERNET AT THE CENTRAL LIBRARY . THE SCHOOL IS FIRST IN THE NATION TO FOCUS_ON ELECTRONIC INFORMATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Students interested in the information superhighway and other electronic technology began taking classes last week at the Los Angeles Central Library , as part of a new program touted as the nation ' s first magnet school to focus_on accessing electronic information . About 90 ninth- and 10th-graders are enrolled in the voluntary program , a joint project of the Los Angeles Public_Library and the Los Angeles Unified School District ' s Downtown Business Magnet High_School . The UCLA Graduate_School of Education and Information is also helping to develop the school ' s unique curricula and offer technical advice . &quot; There ' s nothing else like this , &quot; said Paul McGlothlin , coordinator of the program . &quot; Our program is going_to really allow students to create electronic documents and surf the Internet . They ' ll have the same access to the Internet as a research scientist or a university student. &quot; Richard Lucero , one of four teachers assigned to the magnet program , said students will take science , math , English and social studies courses at the library and the rest of their classes at the Downtown Business Magnet , about a mile away on West Temple Street . The goal of the program , Lucero said , is to incorporate electronic information into almost every academic subject . &quot; For example , in English_class , students will learn how to research their subjects using the library ' s computer_systems , &quot; he said . &quot; And instead of keeping a notebook , they ' ll develop their own electronic portfolio through CD-ROM , where they can keep all_of their assignments. &quot; One of Lucero ' s first goals is to pair each student with a computer &quot; pen_pal &quot; at a South_American school and another in Puerto Rico , where he used to work . Once students master the concept of electronic_mail , they ' ll move_on to more advanced technology , like accessing the global computer_network known as the Internet , he said . &quot; Our goal is try to make everyone computer literate , even though we have some kids who are advanced and others who are afraid of the computer , &quot; he said . Nicholas Pattengale , a 15-year-old sophomore , said he enrolled as soon as he heard about the program because he has been interested in computers since he was 12 . On the first day of class , Pattengale tinkered with a CD-ROM Spanish program at the library ' s Language_Learning Center . &quot; Computers will be a big part of the job market , so this will really help us , &quot; he said . &quot; And these computers are so_much nicer than the standard school computers . It ' s an ideal learning environment. &quot; Students will be bused between the Downtown Business Magnet and the library . They will eat lunch at the business_school and take physical_education classes at the Ketchum Downtown YMCA . The program is one of 24 new magnet programs created by the district this year . Although the school is starting with only ninth- and 10th-graders , juniors and seniors will be added in subsequent years . The school is still accepting applications from freshmen and sophomores who want to enroll this year . &quot; We have about 20 openings , &quot; McGlothlin said . &quot; All we ask is for students who have the desire to learn . . . . We don ' t want our kids to become computer geeks . We want them to use electronic information as tools to help them in all_of their classes. &quot; Ninth- and 10th-graders interested in enrolling in the electronic information magnet program should call McGlothlin at ( 213 ) 228-7504 . * RELATED STORY : Page 6</TEXT>
