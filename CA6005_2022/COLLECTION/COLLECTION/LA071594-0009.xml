   <HEADLINE> COURT REJECTS APPEAL OF RULES FOR LIQUOR_STORES ; REGULATION : OWNERS OF SOUTH-CENTRAL MARKETS DESTROYED IN THE 1992 RIOTS WERE CHALLENGING LOS ANGELES ' CONDITIONS TO ALLOW REOPENING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Supreme Court rejected a challenge Thursday by Korean American store owners to restrictions by the city of Los Angeles on reopening liquor_stores that were burned in the 1992 riots . The owners said conditions imposed by the city were so burdensome that only six of 175 Korean-owned stores licensed to sell alcoholic_beverages have reopened . Their suit argued that the city was trying to regulate liquor sales , which are subject_to exclusive state regulation under California law . But a state appeals court ruled_in Los Angeles ' favor in March , saying the purpose of the city ' s restrictions was to curb undesirable activity near liquor_stores and not to regulate or prohibit liquor sales . The state Supreme Court denied review of the owners ' appeal Thursday . Only Justices Stanley Mosk and Armand Arabian voted for a hearing , two short of the needed majority on the seven-member court . Stephen L . Jones , lawyer for the Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation , blamed hysteria and a neo-Prohibition movement for driving the store owners out of business . He said he was deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court ' s action . After the violence that followed the first Rodney King trial in 1992 , the City_Council passed a resolution blaming an &quot; inordinate &quot; amount of liquor_stores in South-Central Los Angeles for contributing to health and safety problems . The city required liquor_stores that had been destroyed or badly damaged -- most of them Korean-owned -- to obtain new permits before reopening . The permits contained numerous requirements for lighting , graffiti cleanup , trash removal and in some cases limits on hours of operation . Jones said the most burdensome was a requirement that each store have a security_guard . &quot; We ' re dealing with little mom-and-pop minimarkets , &quot; the lawyer said . &quot; To have a full-time , licensed security_guard sit around and eat peanuts is prohibitive. &quot; A guard could do little about the off-site crime problems that were the city ' s professed concern , Jones added . &quot; It ' s just a condition that effectively denies people the ability to go_back into business , &quot; he said . The store owners ' request for an injunction against the permit requirements was denied by Superior_Court Judge Robert O ' Brien in June , 1993 , and their suit was dismissed two months later by Superior_Court Judge Judith Chirlin . The 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld Chirlin ' s ruling this March . The state ' s exclusive authority to regulate liquor sales , established by a 1934 state constitutional amendment , is not violated by the city ' s restrictions on liquor_store operations , said Justice Earl Johnson in the 3-0 ruling . Instead , the city , exercising its power to regulate land use , was trying to control the &quot; negative conduct which tends to occur on premises immediately surrounding &quot; liquor_stores , Johnson said . He also rejected the store owners ' argument that the city was violating a state law that allowed dealers of alcoholic_beverages to maintain their businesses if the only reason for a temporary closure was an &quot; act of God. &quot; An &quot; act_of_God &quot; is a natural force , like an earthquake or lightning , and does not include fires caused by other people , Johnson said .</TEXT>
