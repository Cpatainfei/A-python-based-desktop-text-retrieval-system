   <HEADLINE> FIRST ORDER OF BLACK NUNS HEEDS CALL FOR 165TH YEAR ; CATHOLICISM : OBLATE SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE , FOUNDED TO EDUCATE CHILDREN EXCLUDED FROM SEGREGATED SCHOOLS , HAVE WEATHERED ADVERSITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As wintry light_filters through the stained-glass_windows of Mount Providence , several dozen nuns reaffirm their devotion . Wearing habits , veils and silver wedding_bands , holding hymnals flavored with spirituals , the women appear joyful , serene and a bit mysterious . On the wall behind the altar are words that have helped to define them : &quot; Therefore Go and Teach All Nations. &quot; These women belong_to the world ' s first order of nuns of African heritage , the Oblate Sisters of Providence . Founded in Baltimore 165 years ago with a mission to teach &quot; colored &quot; children , the Oblate Sisters have served schools and orphanages in as_many as 35 states . Now , as is the case in other religious_orders , their numbers have dwindled and their members have aged . But their sense_of_purpose remains strong , bolstered by a history of forbearance . The sisters have worshiped in basement chapels . They have weathered the animosity of white Catholics who objected to seeing black_women in habits . They have survived periods in which church officials , pessimistic about their survival , advised them to &quot; return to the world. &quot; One 69-year-old sacristan remembers the days when black nuns were permitted to take communion only after white communicants had finished . The Oblate Sisters ' belief is rooted in the order ' s extraordinary beginnings . In 1817 , Elizabeth Lange , founder of the order , came_to Baltimore from the Caribbean with two major handicaps : She was a free black_woman in a slave_state and a Catholic in what was then a predominantly Protestant city . Furthermore , she spoke only French . At the time , Baltimore had become home to thousands of refugees from political upheavals in Santo Domingo and other islands . When the emigrants arrived , they found a segregated society where their children could not attend schools . With the help of the Rev . James Joubert , a priest of the Sulpician order , Elizabeth Lange started a school that offered free education for black children . Next , she persuaded the Vatican to approve a convent to serve this mission . When Rome officially recognized the Oblate Sisters of Providence as a religious_order , it became the first within the Catholic_church to devote itself to teaching black children . ( The Latin root of &quot; oblate &quot; refers to someone who offers his or her life to some form of work. ) Over the next century , the Oblates opened and operated many schools around the country . * Today , 147 nuns carry_on the work , and most of them live at the motherhouse . About half are foreign-born . The order has one white member , Sister John Francis Schilling , principal and president of St . Frances Academy in Baltimore . ( The order ' s founding rules state that the Oblate Sisters cannot turn_away aspiring nuns because of race. ) Fewer than 10 nuns are under 40 , says Sister Claudina Sanz , the order ' s superior general . At Mount Providence , copies of Mother Lange ' s portrait can be seen everywhere . The only existing photograph of the founder , taken when she was in her 90s , shows her to be a tiny woman with bright , piercing eyes . She looks wise , determined and , perhaps , a bit stubborn : She continued to speak French all her life even as she fought to expand her congregation in America . Now her order is working hard to advance Mother Lange ' s cause in the Catholic_Church ' s lengthy canonization process , a journey that began three years ago when the Vatican approved the campaign to make her a saint . Sister John Francis Schilling first joined the order in 1967 . Now 48 , the white nun first visited a community of Oblates in Chicago with an African American friend who was interested in becoming a nun . Instead , it was Sister John Francis who decided to join the order . &quot; I was very taken by the sisters ' warmth , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I had been taught by religious all my life , but there was something different about the Oblates that appealed_to me . They weren ' t aloof , there was a warmth , a welcoming kind of acceptance . &quot; At first my parents did not feel I would be accepted in the African American community , but I ' ve found it just to be the opposite . I ' ve been accepted everywhere I ' ve been. &quot; Typical of the Oblate nuns is Sister Claudina , 52 , who grew_up on the island of Belize , the sixth of eight children . She joined the order in 1961 and became its 17th superior general last June . As a child , she was fascinated by the nuns who taught her , and she read as_many books as she could find about convent life . She also participated in almost every extracurricular_activity school offered . Like many of the Oblate Sisters , she chose to join a black order because of the prejudice against black nuns throughout the church . &quot; For a while , they were one of only two communities who accepted applicants who were black , &quot; says Baltimore Archbishop William Keeler . &quot; But in the ' 60s , we all became conscious of the need for racial justice . Many other communities took a lead from ( the Oblates ) and opened_up to people of different racial backgrounds. &quot; Sister Claudina says , &quot; Even until the 1970s , many of the white orders did not accept black girls . I could have joined an order at_home , but I would have been too close to my family and that would have been difficult . My spiritual adviser was a black_man who told me to go_to the Oblates because he understood the racism in the American church. &quot; There are two other primarily African American orders for women : the Holy Family in New Orleans and The Franciscan Handmaids of Mary in New York . Sister Claudina believes the black orders have brought important lessons about persistence and perseverance to the church . &quot; I think black Catholics in the United States have a lot to teach people in_general about love of God and faith in God and that all humankind is one , &quot; she says .</TEXT>
