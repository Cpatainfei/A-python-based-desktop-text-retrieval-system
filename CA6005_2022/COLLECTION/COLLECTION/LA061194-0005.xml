   <HEADLINE> CAL / EPA ' S NEWEST HAZARD : RISKS TO PEACE OF MIND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a 2 1 / 2-year study involving hundreds of people around the state , California has come_up with a new and controversial method of evaluating environmental risk that downplays the traditional role of science and takes_into_account people ' s values , opinions , fears and anxieties . Intended to guide decision-making by the state ' s Environmental Protection Agency , the new approach to risk assessment already is provoking an outcry in the business_community . Critics argue that such broad , subjective criteria will create new layers of regulation and endless obstacles to development . &quot; It ' s the most comprehensive , ambitious of its kind ever undertaken , &quot; said James Strock , state EPA secretary . Although similar efforts in other states have tended to prioritize risks on the basis of their effects on healthy adults , the California Comparative Risk Project would attach a higher priority to environmental problems that have a disproportionate effect on children or minority populations , or if they are seen as disrupting the social_welfare of a community or even its peace_of_mind . Peace_of_mind pollution ? Yes , indeed . The 640-page report , expected to be released this month , defines peace_of_mind as : &quot; Good mental_health , trust of governing institutions , access to reliable information , personal security and healthy personal relationships. &quot; The report , obtained by The Times in_advance of its release , takes its most subjective turn_in a chapter that says an environmental problem can threaten people ' s social_welfare if it mars a view of a pleasing landscape or damages a child ' s &quot; view of their world as a safe and nurturing place. &quot; The project is based on the premise that science-based risk assessment is too uncertain given its heavy reliance on animal test results that may_not apply to humans . While government regulators wait for the definitive studies on the dangers of agricultural pesticides or industrial emissions , pollution can run rampant , goes the thinking behind the project . &quot; This is the first major project of its kind in the country that basically owned up_to the fact that totally relying_on experts and technical data is too narrow an approach , &quot; said John Moore , a Washington risk-assessment consultant who spent 20 years at the National Institutes of Health and the federal Environmental Protection Agency . Moore was a member of the project ' s advisory committee . According to the report , &quot; Risk is the likelihood of harmful effects , including human disease or death , damage to ecosystems , property losses and anxiety about the future. &quot; &quot; The study tells us to look_at ' hot spots , ' &quot; said Charles Shulock , the state EPA ' s chief deputy director of environmental health hazard assessment . &quot; It tells us to look_at farm_worker communities exposed to high levels of pesticides , children who are more vulnerable to respiratory_diseases , or subsistence fishermen who may ingest dangerously high levels of mercury because they eat more fish. &quot; The project divides environmental risks into three categories : human health , ecosystem health and social_welfare . The most serious hazards to human health include secondhand tobacco smoke , radon , ozone and an assortment of chemical contaminants , such_as mercury and arsenic , found in fish and drinking_water . Cited among the highest risks to ecological health are greenhouse gases released from the burning of fossil_fuels , clear-cutting of forests and diversion of water from rivers and estuaries , particularly in the San Francisco Bay delta system . The social_welfare category repeated several types of risks listed elsewhere and added pesticides , lead and particulate matter . A collaboration of people representing government , business , environmental organizations , academia and community groups , the study has been a hot_potato from the outset , with business critics frequently challenging the methodology . A recent imbroglio has delayed the public release of the report , which had been scheduled for release Tuesday . Last week , Michael DiBartolomeis Jr. , an EPA toxicologist who coordinated the work of citizen volunteers and government technocrats , suddenly quit the project , citing interference by Strock . DiBartolomeis objected to Strock ' s decision to interrupt the printing of the study in_order to append Strock ' s views of the project , some of them critical . DiBartolomeis says that the cost of the study , about $ 350 # 000 , will go_up another $ 20 # 000 as a result . Strock ' s action aroused suspicions among some of those who participated that he was succumbing to pressure from business interests . But Strock said he is only trying to explain how the study would be used . &quot; This is in no way an attempt to undermine the independence of the report , &quot; he said , noting that he was making no changes in the body of the study or its conclusions . Strock said his memo does take_issue with some of the project ' s conclusions , but he said his disagreements do not lessen the value of the project , which he said would play a prominent role in setting future agency priorities . He also denied that his memo , which he has not released , is in response to a lengthy critique of the project by an industry lobbying group , the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance . Regarding the project as a recipe for runaway regulation of industry , the Council for Economic Balance said the work is rife_with political rhetoric , its science of dubious value and its assertion that poor people and minority groups are at higher risk is never substantiated . The project report admits that statewide data for minority &quot; hot spots &quot; do not exist and that &quot; monitoring data to describe actual human exposures to most pollutants are also not available. &quot; Nevertheless , in a supplementary section on environmental education , the report says : &quot; The fact that poor people and people_of_color tend to live_in areas that are more heavily polluted should be addressed in the classroom. &quot; The state ' s business_community wasn ' t alone in expressing skepticism about some aspects of the report . Even as it was being formulated , the part dealing with &quot; peace_of_mind &quot; invited comparison with the much-lampooned task_force on self-esteem created four years ago by state Assemblyman John Vasconcellos ( D-Santa Clara ) . Even environmentalists who worked_on the study worry that some of the more subjective aspects of it will detract from its overall value . &quot; There are some squishy areas that can make you a bit queasy . No doubt about that , &quot; said Lawrie Mott , a scientist with the Natural_Resources Defense Council and a member of the advisory committee that reviewed the study . Still , Mott defended the effort to consider social_welfare as part of the risk assessment project . &quot; The project was trying to find a way to integrate value judgments into risk assessment . It was another way of telling the regulatory_agencies that there are other factors to consider besides statistics. &quot; Mott and others emphasized the importance of moving beyond cancer studies as the only true measure of risk assessment . &quot; From the beginning , all_of us said there is so_much uncertainty about the ( cancer ) data , and it leaves_out so_much about other health hazards , &quot; said Carol Henry , who was the ranking EPA official assigned to the project until moving to the federal_Department of Energy last March . &quot; In past studies , a whole range of non-cancer problems haven ' t been factored into risk assessment , &quot; Henry said . &quot; Reproductive , neurological , respiratory and other effects that may_not have death as an end_point . We show them to be a major concern in this study. &quot;</TEXT>
