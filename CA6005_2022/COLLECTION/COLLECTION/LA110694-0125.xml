   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; ANOTHER CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT IN ANGOLA -- AND AFRICA ' S LONGEST WAR RAGES ON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peace in the Middle_East . Rapprochement on the Korean_peninsula . Democracy in South_Africa . At a time when many of the world ' s major conflicts are nearing negotiation , if not resolution , Angola ' s 19-year civil_war , Africa ' s longest , stands apart . On Oct . 17 , the government of Angola and its chief rival announced that they had , yet again , reached an agreement in principle to end the fighting . Still , the conflict rages virtually unabated , despite a U.N. Security_Council demand that all military operations cease . Angola ' s post-colonial history is littered with a long line of accords , agree-ments , cease-fires , protocols and treaties brokered by the United Nations , the Organization of African Unity and interested countries like the United States and Portugal . The treaties bear the exotic names of their venues -- the Alvor and Nakuru agreements , the Nkomati and Lusaka accords , the Gbadolite , Bicesse and the Sao Tome summits , to name a_few -- and have been broken , in whole or part , by both parties to the conflict . But there is something more insidious operating in Angola : a deep enmity among Angolans based on ethnicity and ideology . Historically , these divisions were first exploited by the slave_traders , then by the colonizers , and most recently by Cold_War powers . Today , Angolans themselves propagate their own disunity . No party brings clean hands to the table . The war began in 1975 , shortly after a defeated Portuguese government ceded power to a tripartite alliance of indigenous liberation movements : the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) , supported by the intellectual elite of Luanda , Angola ' s capital , and the Kimbundu peoples of northwestern Angola ; the National Front for the Liberation of Angola ( FNLA ) , backed by the Bakongo peoples of northeastern Angola , and the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola ( UNITA ) , favored by the mostly peasant population of the Ovimbundu people of central and southern Angola . The three liberation movements signed a joint agreement at Alvor , Portugal , to build a &quot; just and democratic society in Angola. &quot; But a month later , fighting erupted between two of the movements . Depending_on its ideology , each group sought and received international support . The Soviet_Union -- and , later , Cuba -- sent troops to support the MPLA . China and South_Africa lined_up behind UNITA . The United States began its involvement in 1975 , when it opened an office in Luanda to coordinate military assistance to the FNLA , whose members soon scattered into either the MPLA or UNITA . As each faction received support from abroad , each renewed its claim to run the government and demanded international recognition . By the late 1970s , most European_countries recognized the MPLA as Angola ' s government , and by 1979 , when President Jose Eduardo dos Santos assumed office , it began offering economic incentives to foreign companies to invest in the country , especially in its petroleum industry . Ironically , the regime was moving closer to East European communists even as it courted capitalists . From the 1980s until recently , relations between the United States and Angola were strained because of U.S. support for UNITA . In 1985 , Congress , at President Ronald Reagan ' s behest , repealed the Clark Amendment , which , since 1976 , had prohibited U.S. military assistance to UNITA . This allowed_for the free flow of arms and support to UNITA while barring the U.S._government from buying Angolan oil . Paradoxically , Gulf Oil , one of America ' s largest petroleum companies , continued to operate in Angola ' s Cabinda province , providing the MPLA regime with much-needed hard currency . In 1988 , with the military conflict a standoff , talks among Cuba , Angola and South_Africa led to a settlement in which the fates of Angola and Namibia were diplomatically linked . Namibia won its independence in 1990 , but the Angolan conflict remained unresolved . After a series of on-again , off-again talks , the MPLA and UNITA reached a ease-fire agreement in the spring of 1991 . Timetables and a framework for elections were established . A joint political-military commission , composed of representatives from the MPLA , UNITA , Portugal , Russia and the United States , was set_up . National elections were scheduled in September , 1992 , to be conducted under U.N. auspices . A new consolidated army was to be assembled by the end of that year . In the interim , the MPLA government legalized opposition parties . By all outward appearances , the dream of democracy seemed closer to reality . But the election results , though declared essentially free and fair , were disputed . Jonas Malheiro Savimbi , UNITA ' s candidate , demanded a recount after a preliminary tally showed him trailing . Although Savimbi was operating within the rules of the agreement , the MPLA government denied his request . UNITA withdrew its forces from the combined army . Soon , hostilities erupted again . In November , 1993 , negotiations resumed in Lusaka , under the shepherding of U.N. Special Representative Alioune Beye , and culminated in last month ' s agreement . Under normal circumstances , a negotiated settlement should be cause for celebration . But nothing about the Angolan situation is normal . Angolans appreciate the danger in premature optimism . Their country holds the inglorious distinction of having the world ' s largest population of amputees , thanks to the profligate use of land_mines by both sides during the civil_war . If the Angolan conflict is to be resolved and the Lusaka peace accord to endure , the United States must use its leverage with Angolans to promote the principle and spirit of reconciliation . This means actively opposing 11th-hour military efforts to gain advantages at the negotiating table . Despite the Clinton_Administration ' s support for the MPLA government , it is clear that Angola will not have peace unless and until Savimbi ' s UNITA is given a meaningful role in the governance of the country . According to reliable estimates , UNITA controls anywhere from 25 % to 40 % of Angola and is strongly supported by one-third of the country ' s citizens . Disenfranchising such a significant opposition would dispel any hope for federalism or proportional government , and , in the long_run , would be a recipe for more killing and bloodshed. *</TEXT>
