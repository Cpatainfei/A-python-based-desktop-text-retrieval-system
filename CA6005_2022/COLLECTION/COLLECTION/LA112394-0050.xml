   <TEXT> &quot; Man instinctively regards himself as a wanderer and wayfarer , &quot; wrote Thomas Merton , &quot; and it is second nature for him to go_on pilgrimage in search of a privileged and holy place. &quot; There ' s something of the pilgrimage and the quest at the heart of Sheila Paine ' s &quot; The Afghan Amulet , &quot; an account of her journeys through Asia_Minor in search of the origins of a rare and remarkable amulet that shows_up in clothing and jewelry from Afghanistan to Bulgaria . &quot; All these devices protected the wearer from the djinn , &quot; she explains , &quot; whose evil_spirits that in Islamic mythology lurk among men and angels , ready to attack but known to be frightened by dazzle , by colour , by curving lines and by the tinkling of a woman ' s clothing as she moves. &quot; So we learn right away that Paine is a sophisticated observer of both folkways and fashion ; she is an intrepid traveler who is not afraid to trek into the farthest reaches of the Hindu Kush or the most desperate precincts of battle-ravaged Afghanistan . And she is a writer whose work is_full of high spirits , subtle wit and good_humor . Her quest begins in a London shop , where she first sees a tribal garment that features the intriguing amulet design -- &quot; a triangular motif dangling with tassels. &quot; Because none of the so-called experts can tell her what she wants to know about the amulet -- was it a fertility symbol , a soothsayer ' s badge , a cosmological map , a talisman to ward_off the evil_eye ? -- she vows to find_out for herself . &quot; Its origin remained a mystery , &quot; she writes_of her motive for a truly heroic undertaking . &quot; It was a mystery that intrigued me. &quot; The places that she visits embody a great swath of geography that stretches from Pakistan to Turkey to Bulgaria , a vast sweep of history that reaches from the armies of Alexander the Great to the Afghan guerrillas and Kurdish refugees of_our_own times . Paine ' s adventure is not merely a lark . She ventures , alone , into war zones and police_states and punitive theocracies , and she often finds herself in remote places &quot; still beyond the law &quot; where lone Europeans tend to disappear and show_up dead . &quot; Iran is closed , &quot; a Pakistani official shrieks when Paine announced her intention to cross the border into Iran . &quot; You will be killed there . Or taken hostage . It will be bad for the Department of Archaeology. &quot; But Paine is undaunted , and she describes journeys that bring her into contact with people and places that we might expect to find in a musty old volume of Rudyard Kipling . Indeed , the secret of the amulet is ultimately far less important than the mighty efforts she undertakes to unlock its secrets . At one point , she is recruited for wifely duties by a local potentate in the Hindu Kush whose symbol of authority is a Kalashnikov rifle . Later , she is interrogated by a Pakistani police_officer who confides to her that &quot; one of my ancestors . . . was knighted by Queen Victoria ' s son. &quot; And she narrowly escapes an encounter with a band of Islamic Guards who troll the marketplace in search of women wearing a trace of lipstick or showing a strand of loose hair . &quot; The punishment if you ' re caught is a fine of 200 # 000 rials , a day shackled in prison and 40 lashes of the whip , &quot; she learns . &quot; They let you off the whip if you ' re pregnant. &quot; Because textiles are Paine ' s real passion , she pauses to describe what is being worn -- and why . She notices when women in a mountain valley , far from the ravages of technology and popular culture , are garbed in polyester . And she spots the Coca-Cola bottle caps and military buttons that are sewn into the ceremonial hoods worn of an obscure pagan cult . Paine is impressed by much of what she sees , but she does not offer_up local color merely for its curiosity value . One moment she may compare a verdant valley to &quot; a casual Miro brush stroke , &quot; but a moment letter , she describes the sight of a dying baby in a village square . And even when her prose takes_on the rhythms and images of poetry , she remains clear-eyed and unsentimental . &quot; If India is a land of labyrinths , a maze that at the turning grasps the heart with a flick of sari , with an intensity of colour , with sharp musky scents , marigolds and dusty beggars , &quot; she writes , &quot; Pakistan is a corridor with violence as its walls , stained with blood like spat betel juice. &quot; Paine places herself squarely in a tradition of English literary travel writing that ranges from Charles Doughty ' s &quot; Travels in Arabia Deserta &quot; to Bruce Chatwin ' s &quot; The Songlines. &quot; Perhaps the highest praise that I can bestow upon &quot; The Afghan Amulet &quot; is to say that Sheila Paine clearly belongs in such grand company -- and , in fact , she brings something new and unique and distinctive to the genre .</TEXT>
