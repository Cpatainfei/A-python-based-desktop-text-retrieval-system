   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : IMPACT OF THE FALLING DOLLAR ; TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS ; HOW MANY BEARS WILL A WEAKENING DOLLAR BUY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The calendar says it ' s late June , but on Wall_Street it feels disturbingly like late March . The dollar ' s sudden plunge has pulled U.S. stock and bond markets down sharply , in an eerie replay of the selloff that dominated the last two weeks of the first_quarter . The Dow industrial average lost 33.93 points to 3 # 707.97 on Tuesday , its lowest close since mid-May . And the yield on 30-year Treasury_bonds rose to 7.49 % from 7.46 % on Monday , nearing the 1994 peak of 7.65 % reached in mid-May . This time , however , the carnage is a global event . European stock_markets , which held_up reasonably well even as the Dow slumped 300 points in late March , have led this decline . And in recent days the selling has spread to Canada , Mexico and many Asian markets . Everybody wants to blame the markets ' latest turmoil on the dollar , of course , and that ' s tempting enough . For one thing , a weak dollar raises the prospect of higher U.S. inflation because prices of_imported goods can automatically rise as the buck slides . Moreover , if the dollar ' s decline worsens significantly , the Federal_Reserve_Board may be compelled to raise interest_rates to try to defend the currency . Wall_Street had just begun to feel confident that the Fed would wait until late summer before considering whether the economy warranted tighter credit . Now all bets_on a benign Fed are off , and that ' s bad news for countries whose short-term rates are , in_effect , tied to ours ( like Hong Kong and Mexico ) . But some pros say the weak dollar is just a symptom of the markets ' real problem : We ' re in a nearly global bear_market in_stocks and bonds , which means sellers are in control . Despite periodic rallies -- like the one U.S. stocks enjoyed in early June -- the overriding trend in financial assets is down , the bears argue . &quot; I see this as a step-by-step , grinding kind of decline , &quot; says Richard McCabe , technical market_analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . in New York . Not surprisingly , there are still plenty of people who resist the bear scenario . The optimists either see the dollar stabilizing soon , or they make the point that the dollar ' s latest slide is a blip compared to how much it fell between 1985 and 1993 . ( Remember , the dollar bought 250 Japanese yen in the mid-1980s . So what ' s the big deal about a drop from 111 yen to 100 yen this year ? ) More important than the buck ' s status is the frightening surge in long-term bond yields worldwide this year , in part a winding-down of wild speculation in bonds during 1993 , many Wall Streeters say . The optimists among them believe that yields already have jumped this year to levels that are ridiculously high relative to the global economy ' s growth_rate and to inflation . In Germany , for example , the yield on the benchmark 10-year government_bond closed at 7.32 % on Tuesday , up from 5.89 % in early February and its highest since December , 1992 . Yet inflation in Germany is running at about a 3 % annual rate , which means the &quot; real &quot; yield on the 10-year bond currently is more_than four percentage_points -- quite a payoff historically . &quot; These rates are too high relative to any kind of inflation we see worldwide at the moment , &quot; argues Thomas Robinson , Merrill Lynch ' s international investment strategist . * The bull scenario is that the U.S. economy slows in the second_half , thanks to the Fed ' s first-half credit-tightening moves ; Europe and Japan recover at a modest pace and without higher inflation , allowing bond yields in those economies to resume their declines , and corporate profits continue to rise worldwide , underpinning stocks . The problem with the bulls ' case so far this year is that something always seems to come_along to botch it up . In winter , the problem was the unwinding of the crazed stock and bond speculation fueled by so-called hedge_funds last year ; in the spring , rising commodity prices fanned new worries about inflation ; and now the dollar is sinking , unnerving investors who naturally respond badly to any unforeseen market shock . &quot; When currencies move quickly , it scares people , &quot; says A.C. Moore , investment strategist at money manager SBCM / Argus in Santa Barbara . The great danger now is that the markets ' latest woes will encourage more American investors to do what their European counterparts have already been doing_in spades : Forget the bullish case and just stay invested in short-term securities for safety ' s sake . Or run to gold and other hard assets that traditionally offer refuge . that ' s a recipe for a bear_market . And there ' s a good argument that some European stock_markets are already deep in a bear phase , on the heels of bear-like declines in Asia earlier this year . In Paris , for example , stocks are already down 16.6 % from year ' s end , as measured by that market ' s blue_chip index . If a bear_market is generally described as a minimum 15 % to 20 % decline in prices , much of Europe is there or close . In the United States , the blue_chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index now is off just 3.2 % from year ' s end , though its decline nearly reached 10 % from its February peak to its spring low . James Stack , publisher of the InvesTech market newsletter in Whitefish , Mont. , and an unabashed bear , concedes that the relatively small decline in U.S. stocks thus far makes_it tough for most Wall_Street pros to join the bear camp . Ditto the public , he says . &quot; There ' s a lot of talk_about bearishness , but when one looks_at the new money still going_into stock ( mutual ) funds , the public is not bearish , &quot; Stack says . But as the current selloff in_stocks and bonds hits_home , following so closely on the March selloff , Stack expects the mind-set to turn increasingly cautious . &quot; Historically , big bear_markets come_after periods of market frothiness , high expectations ( for stocks ) and high valuations &quot; in_stock prices , he says . We had the latter in 1993 , he says ; to deny the huge potential for a bear_market now is absurd , he contends . Gold Returns Gold has been the big winner over the past two months , as stock and bond markets have languished .
