   <HEADLINE> SENTENCE OF DEATH IS SOUGHT FOR PANAH ; COURTS : PROSECUTORS SAY MURDER OF NICOLE PARKER , 8 , DEMANDS MAXIMUM PENALTY . SUSPECT PLEADED INNOCENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prosecutors announced Friday they will seek the death_penalty against Hooman Ashkan Panah , the Woodland Hills man accused of abducting and murdering an 8-year-old girl whose battered body was found in his closet . Panah , 22 , has pleaded not_guilty to seven charges , including murder , kidnaping and sodomy , in the Nov . 20 death of Nicole Parker . &quot; I ' m thrilled because I want him dead , &quot; said Lori Parker , mother of the victim . &quot; If they could fry him next week , I ' d push the button. &quot; The decision to seek Panah ' s execution was made by a committee of senior prosecutors , who evaluated the case after reviewing a memo prepared by Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter S . Berman . Panah ' s defense_attorney , Robert Sheahen , was invited to submit statements , but did not , Berman said . Sheahen plans to use a psychological defense . &quot; Hooman has a history of hospitalization for mental_disorders , &quot; Sheahen said Friday . &quot; If California executes a mentally_ill person it would be copying backwater Alabama , currently the only state to impose the death_penalty in such cases. &quot; Nicole ' s nude body was found in a suitcase hidden in Panah ' s bedroom closet under a pile of clothes . Police made the discovery Nov . 21 , one day after dozens of volunteers mounted a search for Nicole , who disappeared from the courtyard of the Ventura Boulevard apartment complex where both her father and Panah lived . &quot; I would say the presumption all along is this was appropriately a death_penalty case , &quot; said Berman , citing the brutality of the slaying . A grand_jury also charged Panah with four special circumstance allegations -- murder in conjunction with kidnaping , sodomy , child molestation and oral copulation -- each of which makes him eligible for the death_penalty . If convicted on any one of the special circumstance charges , Panah would face execution . The minimum sentence , if he is convicted , is life in prison without the possibility of parole . Berman said the most significant factors_in deciding to seek the death_penalty were &quot; the seriousness of the offenses that were committed against the child , the brutality of the murder itself ( and ) the age of the victim. &quot; Panah ' s case involves no &quot; mitigating factors , &quot; or points favorable to the defendant , Berman said . Panah is scheduled to appear in court May 2 for a hearing on the results of two psychological examinations expected to be conducted later this month . Records submitted by Sheahen indicate Panah received psychiatric treatment in 1988 , six months after he left his native Iran . A note found in Panah ' s car after the murder indicates he made a half-hearted suicide attempt , according to police . In the rambling 10-page document with pages apparently smeared with blood from wounds he made to his wrists , Panah blamed the killing on unnamed &quot; psychotic , evil and powerful &quot; people . &quot; We have reviewed all_of the medical_reports that are available to date , and we don ' t quite interpret the results of those reports the same as the defense has done publicly , &quot; Berman said . While refusing to discuss specific facts related to Panah ' s psychological condition , Berman acknowledged certain factors may someday be revealed that could persuade prosecutors to drop their quest_for Panah ' s execution . &quot; Up to this point , there have been no circumstances that we have found that would warrant a disposition ( settlement ) other_than the death_penalty , &quot; Berman said . That sentiment was echoed by the victim ' s mother . &quot; I don ' t think it will hold one drop of water , &quot; Lori Parker said . &quot; Obviously , he ' s sick , but I don ' t think he ' s insane. &quot;</TEXT>
