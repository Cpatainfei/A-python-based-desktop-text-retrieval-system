   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRATS FACE UPHILL FIGHT IN NOVEMBER VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About every week , 10 or so Democratic strategists planning President Clinton ' s role in the 1994 election campaign gather_in the White_House basement under the leadership of Deputy Chief_of_Staff Harold Ickes . Trouble-shooter Ickes ' new job as campaign overseer , which drains time away from his efforts as political point_man for the Administration ' s health_care reform proposal -- the White_House ' s No . 1 legislative priority -- testifies to Clinton ' s awareness that this fall ' s balloting is likely to go_a_long_way toward defining his political future . This is the first midterm election since 1978 in which either party has had control of the White_House as well as both houses of Congress . This means , said Gerald Pomper , a Rutgers University specialist on elections , that &quot; the Democrats won ' t be able to blame the Republicans . They will be running_on their own record. &quot; The Republicans , who share Clinton ' s view of the importance of this November ' s election , say they intend to capitalize . &quot; With all_the talk by the President about the end of gridlock , he has made_it clear to the American people that the Democrats are in_charge of the White_House and the Congress , &quot; said New York Rep . Bill Paxon , chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee . &quot; And when it comes_to Congress , the public is not happy with the job they are doing. &quot; By most reckonings , Republicans have only an outside chance of gaining control of the Senate and no chance at all_of taking the House . But the real danger for Clinton is that the Republicans will make significant inroads , leaving the Democrats in nominal control and Clinton facing what Pomper views_as the worst of all political worlds : &quot; He will still have Democratic majorities in both Houses , but it will be more difficult for him to get his legislation through , &quot; Ickes said . Republicans are also talking boldly of winning governorships in key states , thus making them more difficult for Clinton to win in his expected 1996 reelection bid . To curb the GOP threat , Democratic candidates will point to the improving economy and seek to exploit the power and prestige of the White_House . Already Clinton is contributing to their effort by raising enough money to allow the Democratic National Committee to dole_out $ 7 million to state party organizations and another $ 2 million to House campaigns . Democrats concede that , even with such funds available , they are not likely to outspend the Republicans . Along with financial_support , Democrats are counting_on Clinton ' s ability to deliver on his campaign promises . But the Republicans intend to turn Clinton ' s record against him and his party . Recalling Clinton ' s depiction of himself during the campaign as &quot; a different kind of Democrat , &quot; Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour said : &quot; People have learned that a new kind of Democrat is one who campaigns as a moderate and governs as a liberal. &quot; As the autumn battle_lines emerge , history suggests the obstacles facing the Democrats . Not since 1934 , when a grateful electorate rewarded President Franklin D . Roosevelt and the Democrats for checking the ravages of the Depression , has the party controlling the White_House gained_ground in a midterm election . This year the voters appear to be in a particularly sour mood . Despite upbeat economic indicators , polls show that by margins of 2 to 1 or more , Americans believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction . And in a Gallup Poll released last month , only 29 % of those interviewed approved of Congress ' performance . The Whitewater controversy does not help . At the least , the tangled affair , which is rooted in a failed Arkansas land investment involving the President and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , has hampered Clinton ' s efforts to focus public attention on his policy goals and accomplishments . More seriously , the allegations of abuse of power and conflicts_of_interest have the potential for feeding public cynicism . &quot; It puts the issue of trust in government on the political agenda in a more forceful way than most incumbents would prefer , &quot; Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said . In a year in which they seem bound to lose seats , Democrats are hoping that the enactment of health_care reform will hold_down their losses . &quot; But let ' s assume that Congress refused to pass a health bill the President can sign , &quot; Ickes said . &quot; The President will campaign on that against the Republicans. &quot; Barbour said his party ' s office-holders will not suffer &quot; as long as Republicans oppose Clinton when he ' s wrong and tell why and offer our own solutions. &quot; With more_than six months to go before this argument is settled , here is an early look_at the major battlegrounds . THE HOUSE Republicans last had a majority in the House in 1954 , the year Paxon was born . Now Paxon is saying that his party , which has 176 House members to 257 for the Democrats , is_on the road back to controlling the House by 1996 and will take a giant step_in that direction on Nov . 8 . Democrats , seeking to lower expectations , are eager to agree . &quot; When I look_at all_the retirements and all_the other odds , we could easily reach a scenario where we could lose 25 seats , &quot; said Rep . Vic Fazio of West Sacramento , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee . While that number , in the view of politically neutral analysts , is probably too high , most said they expect the GOP to make healthy gains . Statistics help explain why . Of the 42 open seats that , as of now , will be up for grabs in November because of retirements , 24 are now held by Democrats and 18 are in the hands of Republicans . These are typically the seats that are most likely to move from one party to the other . Moreover , the Democrats ' 24 open seats include 13 where the incumbent won by less than 5 % of the vote_in 1992 . Only four of the Republican open seats meet this description . The most vulnerable incumbents each year tend to be freshmen running_for reelection for the first time . The statistics in this category weigh also against the Democrats : Sixty-four of this year ' s huge freshmen_class are Democrats , compared to 49 Republicans . The challenge of reelection is likely to be tougher than usual , even for many experienced incumbents , because of the redrawing of House districts after the 1990 census . Unlike past congressional_district boundaries , which in many states were devised by Democratic legislators and governors , the 1992 lines were more often drawn impartially by courts and intended to create competitive districts . THE SENATE As in the House , the numbers in the Senate are_on the Republicans ' side . Of the 34 seats up for reelection in November , 21 are now held by Democrats and only 13 are in GOP hands . Five of the Democratic incumbents have already announced their retirements , while only three Republicans have done so . Some GOP gains seem all but certain in the chamber , where Democrats hold a 56-44 edge . As Republicans see it , the most likely states to turn_over include Maine , where Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell is retiring , and Ohio , where veteran Democrat Howard M . Metzenbaum is calling it quits . Other possibilities for Republicans have been created by the retirements of Donald W . Riegle Jr . in Michigan , Harlan Mathews in Tennessee and Dennis DeConcini in Arizona . In addition , Democrats are conceding that at least three of their incumbents face particularly difficult challenges : Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania , Charles S . Robb in Virginia and Frank R . Lautenberg in New Jersey . On the other hand , Democratic officials say believe that they have a chance to pick_up seats in three races where Republicans are retiring , particularly in Minnesota , where Dave Durenberger is leaving , and to a lesser degree in Missouri , where John C . Danforth is stepping_down , and Wyoming , where Malcolm Wallop is leaving . THE GOVERNORS Because campaigns_for_governor are generally contests between high-profile state personalities arguing over state issues , no President is likely to have much impact on their outcome except by contributing his fund-raising abilities to the candidates of his party , which Clinton has done . On the other hand , political professionals contend that if a party ' s candidates for governors do_well in key states , the presidential nominee of the same party stands to benefit . &quot; Governors help shape public_opinion in their states and can help deliver the vote , &quot; said Indiana Gov . Evan Bayh , head of the Democratic Governors ' Assn . In this year ' s races , the Democrats are also fighting numbers that are the price of past success . Of the 36 governorships on state ballots , 21 are held by Democrats , 13 by Republicans and two , Alaska and Connecticut , by independents . With the 1996 presidential election on the horizon , the most significant contests this year are in the eight states with the most electoral votes -- 228 of the 270 needed to win the presidency . In the state with the most votes , California , incumbent Republican Pete Wilson trails the front-running contender for the Democratic nomination , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , but Republicans say Wilson will bounce_back . In the second-place state , New York , Republicans say they are intrigued by the apparent weakness of three-term Democratic incumbent Mario M . Cuomo , but no strong contender has emerged from the GOP field of aspirants -- and none probably will until the primary in September . Republicans also say they hope that George W . Bush , son of Clinton ' s predecessor , can unseat Democrat Ann Richards in Texas even as his brother , Jeb , seeks the GOP nomination to run against Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles in Florida . Democrats say they believe that they have a chance to oust Republican incumbents John Engler in Michigan and Jim Edgar in Illinois . In Ohio , Republican Gov . George_V . Voinovich appears relatively secure . In Pennsylvania , where the state constitution bars incumbent Democrat Robert P . Casey from seeking reelection , the stage is set for a close fight .</TEXT>
