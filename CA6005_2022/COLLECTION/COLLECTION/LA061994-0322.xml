   <HEADLINE> MIAMI HAITIANS FRUSTRATED BY NEW , TIGHTER SANCTIONS ; EMBARGO : PLAN TO HALT FLIGHTS TO ISLAND NATION , LIMIT CASH TRANSFERS , CAUSES WORRY ABOUT BUSINESS , KIN ' S PLIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Travel_agent Carole Thebaud can only guess what effect the impending cutoff of U.S. air traffic and large cash transfers to Haiti will have_on restoring democracy to her impoverished homeland . But she is sure that the tough new sanctions are about to drive her out of business . Days away from the start of new Clinton_Administration measures designed to increase the pressure on Haiti ' s military government , Thebaud said : &quot; I ' m barely surviving . This should be our high season right now . But look . There ' s no one in here . Because all available flights out of Haiti are sold out. &quot; Thebaud , whose small storefront business is in the heart of Miami ' s Little Haiti , is just one of thousands of Haitians in the United States , most of them in South Florida and New York , being squeezed_by the U.S. effort to tighten the screws on the leaders of the military coup that ousted democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 . As of Saturday , all commercial flights between the United States and Haiti will end and cash transfers between the two nations will be limited to $ 50 a month . The targets of the stepped-up sanctions , announced by President Clinton June 10 , are the coup leaders and their wealthy supporters . Last week , U.S. officials reported seeing signs that an embargo put_in place earlier is beginning to work and that a military invasion of Haiti seems less likely . But according to those on the streets of Miami ' s vibrant , Creole-speaking neighborhoods , the embargo is hurting those outside Haiti too . &quot; I think the embargo is a cruel thing , &quot; said Joseph Pierre , director of the Caribbean Marketplace , where several vendors rent space in a tin-roofed warehouse . &quot; This is killing business in Little Haiti . We are down to six tenants , and , if the embargo continues , all will close. &quot; Many import-export businesses , and the once-brisk overseas freighter traffic between Miami and Port-au-Prince , have been shut_down since May , when a hemispheric economic embargo was broadened to include all but humanitarian shipments . Several small Haitian cargo boats now sit idle in the Miami River . Thebaud , whose business was based almost solely on booking flights to Haiti , suddenly has nothing to sell . Although American Airlines added flights between the United States and Haiti after the ban was announced , all seats out of Haiti were snapped_up within hours . &quot; I can get you to Haiti , &quot; said Thebaud , &quot; but I can ' t get you a flight out. &quot; The run_on flights out of Haiti has left many Haitians in Miami unable to attend_to family or business affairs there . Moreover , many Haitians with visas for the United States cannot find a way_out of their country . Miami attorney Cheryl Little said she has asked the White_House to provide special charters for several children , dependents of U.S. residents , who have visas but no way to get_to this country . Across 54th Street from Thebaud ' s office , Fred St . Amand was busy . Half a dozen people , some with cash_in_hand , waited in_line at his Valparaiso United Services to transfer money to relatives in Haiti before the deadline . Said Antoine Jean , 50 , a liquor warehouse worker who had just wired $ 100 to his four children in Cape Haitien : &quot; I do this every week. &quot; So what will happen after Saturday when his family ' s monthly stipend drops from $ 400 to a maximum of $ 50 ? Jean grimaced and shook his head . St . Amand fears the worst . &quot; I think there is a potential for violence , here and in Haiti , &quot; he said . &quot; What do you think is going_to happen when a man in Miami gets a call from his wife , and she says : ' Honey , I ' m starving to death . I have no money , and there is nothing in the markets . What are you going_to do ? ' &quot; U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti have estimated that about 15 % of the country ' s residents are dependent_on money or other goods sent regularly from the United States . St . Amand says that figure is too low . He said his agency , one of many in Miami , transfers up_to $ 200 # 000 a month to Haiti in amounts that average about $ 100 a week per customer . &quot; In my opinion , I think most people are having second_thoughts on the embargo , &quot; St . Amand said . &quot; Now they are saying : ' Your kids won ' t be able to eat , and you can ' t travel_to see them. ' People feel confused. &quot; Indeed , in a city where support for Aristide has long been fervent and near-universal , it is not uncommon now to hear criticism of the soft-spoken Roman_Catholic priest . &quot; Aristide is a good_guy but I question whether he is the right person for the country now , &quot; said Philip Dierre of the Haitian Task_Force , a business development group . Said Joseph Pierre : &quot; Why should we squeeze the people down there , while Aristide is living well here ? &quot; Little , an attorney for Florida Rural Legal Services , insisted that support for Aristide is still strong in Little Haiti . But , she added , &quot; people are becoming extremely frustrated . So little seems to have been accomplished . &quot; The embargo has been hurting the poor because it has not been strictly enforced . The rich have been able to go_around it , to get goods they need through the black_market , while the military has been making a fortune off of it . &quot; If the embargo is enforced , and it means the return of Aristide , then people are for it. &quot; William H . Gray III , President Clinton ' s special adviser on Haiti , has rejected the idea that the new sanctions would hurt the average Haitian . At the same time , he said the Administration would increase its $ 70-million-a-year humanitarian aid program to Haiti to add about 300 # 000 more people to the 1 million now being fed .</TEXT>
