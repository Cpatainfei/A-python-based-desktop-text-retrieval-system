   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; CITY TO BUY 50 HOMES FROM HUD FOR $ 2.3 MILLION ; REDEVELOPMENT : THE UNSIGHTLY HOUSES WILL BE REPAIRED AND SOLD , WITH PROFITS GOING TO A CITY FUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The City_Council has agreed to spend $ 3.3 million in redevelopment money to buy , renovate and resell 50 deteriorating houses that were repossessed by the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development . Councilman Michael Singer cast the only vote against the program Tuesday night , saying he did not want the city to own 50 houses , even if only for the time it will take_to fix them . &quot; I ' ve been uncomfortable with the city being involved in more and more real_estate deals , &quot; he said Wednesday . &quot; This particular deal strikes me as being in competition with both the real_estate industry and with private homeowners trying to sell their homes. &quot; Singer said Wednesday that he would have preferred to see the city offer low-interest loans to buyers who wanted to fix_up the houses themselves . But the remaining four council_members endorsed its so-called Operation Clean Sweep . Mayor Frank Roberts said the program is supported by local real_estate_agents and by residents who are upset about unsightly , uninhabited houses in their neighborhood . &quot; It ' s a win-win situation , &quot; Roberts said . &quot; You ' re going to affect the whole block. &quot; Under the program , the city will use $ 2.3 million in redevelopment money to buy 50 houses from HUD . The Federal_Housing_Administration insured the mortgages for these houses , and HUD took possession after the original owners failed to make their payments . HUD has agreed to sell the houses to the city at 30 % less than their appraised value . The city then plans to spend another $ 1 million in additional redevelopment money to hire local contractors to repair and landscape the properties . When the houses are repaired , 25 brokers from the Antelope Valley Board of Realtors will be selected by lottery to market the homes . The listing agent will receive a 3 % commission and 4 % will be paid to the agent who arranges a sale . Buyers must agree to live_in the house . Proceeds from the sales will return to the city ' s redevelopment fund , officials said . Marvin McKinnon , president-elect of the Board of Realtors , said neglected HUD foreclosure houses often become illegal shelters for squatters and drug dealers .</TEXT>
