   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S ELECTION OF SOCIALIST RAISES THE SPECTER OF TURMOIL ; TRADE : TOMIICHI MURAYAMA AS NEW PRIME_MINISTER ADDS STRAIN TO U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Socialist_party leader Tomiichi Murayama ' s election Wednesday as Japanese prime_minister places new strains on U.S.-Japan trade relations and may derail Tokyo ' s efforts to carry_out economic reforms . Japanese business_leaders and bureaucrats reacted with alarm to the prospect that the new government -- a coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and the Socialists -- may be paralyzed by infighting between conservatives and leftists , who joined in an alliance of convenience to oust the reformist coalition of outgoing Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata . A Murayama Administration will probably be even less accommodating to the United States on trade issues and largely unwilling to dismantle regulations that protect farmers , retailers and industry from unfettered domestic and foreign competition . Aside from supporting the interests of farmers and small shopkeepers , the LDP and the Socialists share few policies . The LDP was always seen as the representative of big business , while the Socialists depend_on labor_union backing . The LDP built_up a large nuclear_power industry in Japan , while the Socialists are anti-nuclear . Together , however , the two parties represent the old , highly regulated Japan , and some commentators said Murayama ' s election means bringing_back the old system in disguise . &quot; Although Murayama will be prime_minister , the Liberal Democratic Party will be the core of the Cabinet , &quot; said Kosaku Inaba , chairman of the Japan Chamber_of_Commerce and Industry . &quot; I ' m worried that on fundamental things , they won ' t be able to reach agreement. &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , setting the stage for a possible standoff on trade issues when President Clinton and Murayama meet in Naples , Italy , next week , cautioned against expecting any quick economic breakthroughs with Japan . &quot; I think we have to be careful , cautious , realistic and pragmatic as we deal with these Japanese officials under a situation where we face the fourth Japanese government in less than a year , &quot; Kantor said in Washington . Concern that trade tensions may escalate again helped send the dollar to a post-World War II record low . The dollar opened in Tokyo today at a record-low 98.83 yen , but closed_in morning trading up slightly at 99.07 yen . Without strong leadership in Tokyo willing to reduce the trade surplus through market-opening measures and economic stimulus , many observers see an even stronger yen as the key to cutting the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan , which hit $ 60 billion last year . A strong yen makes Japanese goods less competitive overseas . One area in which Japan ' s new government might take policy initiatives favored by the United States is tax reform and economic stimulus . The Clinton_Administration has been pushing Tokyo to expand domestic consumption -- and thereby pull_in more foreign goods -- by extending indefinitely an income_tax cut that so far has been enacted only for this year . The Ministry of Finance opposes extending tax cuts without raising consumption taxes , but it ' s possible the politicians could extend the cut without acting_on consumption taxes . It is more likely , however , that sharp differences between the Socialists and powerful Ministry of Finance bureaucrats will merely produce deadlock . Murayama struck a noncommittal tone on economic issues in a news_conference shortly after his election . &quot; There are many things requested ( of Japan ) , such_as tax reduction and deregulation , &quot; he said . &quot; I want to research such items sufficiently to cooperate internationally. &quot; Some career civil_servants , talking with Japanese reporters Wednesday , made no attempt to hide their disdain for the country ' s new leader , who has never before held a post in government . As a member_of_Parliament , Murayama concentrated_on pension , welfare and labor issues . &quot; What ? Mr. Murayama ? I ' m really surprised . What kind of person is he ? &quot; a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official , who was not identified by name , said to a reporter for Kyodo news service . The disrespect appears to be mutual . Shortly after Murayama ' s election , Koken Nosaka , chairman of the Socialist ' s steering_committee in the lower house of Parliament , complained bitterly about Ministry of Finance officials ' opposition to cutting income_taxes without a firm commitment to raise other taxes . He pledged that under Murayama , politicians will fight against such resistance to their policies . MAIN STORY : A1</TEXT>
