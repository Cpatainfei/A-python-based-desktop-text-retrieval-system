   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS ; NOW , THE LIST IS COMPLETE ; BRETT BUTLER ( OUR PLAYER ) ; A TELEVISION_STAR AND HER CELLULAR EXPERIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like many people , Brett Butler remembers watching the Academy Awards on TV when she was growing_up in Marietta , Ga. , and dishing the stars , the dresses , the escorts and , most of all , the attitude required to make an entrance at the Oscars . But the comedian and star of ABC ' s hit series &quot; Grace Under Fire &quot; had never attended the ceremonies -- until this year . Calendar invited Butler to check_out the stars ' arrivals from ringside at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and tell us what it ' s really like . When I was asked to cover the Oscars for the L.A. Times , I thought I could . But then I wondered , would I be too worshipful ? After all , haven ' t I watched nearly every telecast in the 36 years I ' ve been alive ? Even as a child , I was a captive listener to the teariest acceptance speeches of the dullest technical awards , realizing that a lifetime of work had culminated in that moment . In the space of a year I ' ve gone from being an unknown comedian to a television-generated star , the poor cousin of movie_stars . that ' s what TV_stars are , compared to the visiting royalty of film_stars . And in the eight months I ' ve been in L.A. , I ' ve waded far into the sea of celebrity . I ' m proud to say I have a passable backstroke . Monday night was the night everyone who likes swimming comes_out to see how it ' s done . We watch bits and pieces of what stars do on the screen and how they &quot; really &quot; are and realize that Esther Williams and Edy Williams are not related at all and that , if they are , it is only at the show-biz family picnic that is the Oscars . To stand outside the Pavilion with a notebook and a cellular_phone with the other members of the press , I had to go_through ego detox . And I will never cross two streets in an evening_gown again . I discovered something else : Cops allow sequins where no jeans will tread . I will say this , it was much nicer outside than I thought it would be . It was sunny and breezy and crisp and everyone smelled good . I think_of myself as someone who is not star-struck , per se -- then I saw Jeremy Irons and I almost fainted . After living for nine years in New York City , I couldn ' t help but wonder if the things yelled to celebrities would not be vastly different in that arena . Since this is a family newspaper , I will not say the ways in which the statements would be different . The most ridiculous , defining and beautiful moment of the evening : hearing the press yell out_to the people passing_by -- &quot; Who are you ? &quot; I did not know that fundamentalist Christians picketed the Oscars , and I was amused by this . There were huge signs urging the industry to repent , calling anyone associated with any of the films &quot; scum &quot; -- but someone had tacked_on a little sign that said &quot; except for ' Schindler ' s List. ' &quot; One might assume that these are Christians who loved &quot; E.T. &quot; One of my favorite sights of the evening was watching these statuesque , gorgeous , perfectly coiffed women staring up at the people holding the signs that said &quot; Repent. &quot; Talk_about not a chance in hell . My fashion scoop for this year ' s Academy Awards , the items that were big and timeless : There was a lot of big hard hair and breasts to match . And I can go the rest of my life without seeing a perm , a tan and a face-lift on the same man . The woman with Christian Slater had a tattoo on her arm , but it was under chiffon -- I can ' t think_of another event that would combine those two looks . ( But she ' s skinny enough to get_away with it. ) And another thing : The class lines are broken_in show_business . I found myself looking_at the female stars and wondering how many of them , like me , used to count pennies to buy eye shadow -- the cheap kind . And look_at us now , I thought wryly . This is what I did to annoy some of the overly visible female stars : When I came_up_to them in the press line , I moved my finger over my teeth , as if to indicate a massive display of lipstick on an incisor . I couldn ' t help but notice the less-famous spouses of some celebrities looking really uncomfortable . The press would scream at the stars , &quot; Who is that with you ? , &quot; as though the people they were with were something on a leash . I ' d already felt weird standing next to the tabloid writers ; when I had that thought , I realized I ' d been standing too close to the tabloid writers . Being outside the Pavilion amid the din of multiple helicopters felt_like some sort of Neiman-Marcus version of the evacuation of Saigon . If you ' d been a pregnant woman with a small child , that crowd would have saved Versace over you . French manicured nails would have pushed him up_on the helicopter . And yet , I found myself waving to them , as if I thought my mom would see me at_home . I saw some people who looked wicked and jaded -- people who looked as if they ' d been to 20 or 30 of these things -- and I just loved them . They actually bulge well in sequins . At the end , as I was leaving , I couldn ' t resist going_back before the cameras to hear the crowd yell a little . This evening is evil and wonderful and titillating -- and I am inextricably in it .</TEXT>
