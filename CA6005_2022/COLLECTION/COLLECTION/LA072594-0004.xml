   <HEADLINE> MTA BUS STRIKE STILL THREATENED TODAY ; TRANSIT : DRIVERS UNION TENTATIVELY OKS A CONTRACT BUT WAS TO STOP WORK_AT MIDNIGHT IN SUPPORT OF CLERKS AND MECHANICS IF THEY FAILED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although the drivers union reached a tentative contract settlement Sunday , clerks and mechanics for Los Angeles County ' s Metropolitan Transportation Authority were still poised to strike at 12:01 a.m. today , and the drivers union said it would honor their picket_lines . Negotiations continued late Sunday . The labor dispute could strand 1.2 million riders and create a traffic Sig-Alert for everybody else . It would be the first shutdown of the nation ' s second-largest transit system since 1982 , when drivers walked_off their job for five days , and provide a double whammy to bus and train riders who two weeks ago were hit with a fare increase . There was a 68-day walkout in 1974 . Negotiations continued Sunday evening at a Burbank hotel . Contracts between unions representing 6 # 500 bus and train drivers , mechanics and clerks expired June 30 . Gov . Pete Wilson could seek a court_order imposing a 60-day cooling-off period to delay a strike , but Wilson spokesman Paul Kranhold said Sunday that the governor will not intervene . A Wilson aide pointed_out that both Democrats and Republicans on the MTA board had unanimously asked Wilson not to intercede , in an apparent tactic to pressure the unions to reach a settlement . The bus_drivers union has asked Wilson to intervene . But it also benefits Wilson politically not to intervene , transit officials said . For the governor , it would be better to have a strike now rather than closer to the November election , when it would be fresher in voters ' minds . Wilson has said that he is concerned that delaying a strike until September would hit students returning to school . In the event of a strike , MTA plans to operate about 300 buses on the 30 busiest routes -- a mix of MTA buses operated by non-union workers and yellow school_buses driven by drivers from private companies . ( Usually , the MTA operates 1 # 900 buses on 200 routes. ) MTA is paying $ 160 # 000 a day to contract with two private bus_companies . Service on the Blue Line and the Red_Line subway would continue . Bus and train service would operate only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays . The fare on MTA buses and the Metro Blue Line would be 50 cents during a strike , with no transfers . Elderly and disabled would pay 25 cents . Fare on the Red_Line would remain 25 cents . No fee would be charged to board the private_school buses during at least the first week of the walkout . Once fare boxes were installed , the fares would be the same as other strike fares . &quot; Driver qualifications and maintenance standards for MTA buses and trains during a strike will not be compromised , &quot; said Franklin White , MTA ' s chief_executive_officer . Initially , MTA replacement drivers would be supervisors who once drove buses . But the MTA is training other workers to drive buses if the strike drags_on . Unlike transit workers in some East Coast cities , California bus and train operators are not prohibited from striking . A strike would not include the Metrolink commuter rail or municipal or private operators such_as the Los Angeles city commuter express and DASH shuttle_buses , the Long_Beach , Montebello and Santa Monica municipal lines and Foothill Transit . Metrolink plans to increase train service in the event of a strike . And officials plan to modify the routes of the DASH shuttle and commuter express lines to link up_to MTA buses in the event of a strike . Robert Yates , head of the Los Angeles Department_of_Transportation , said he will be monitoring traffic conditions on a computer in City_Hall and assign 500 traffic_control officers as needed to congested intersections . A special team of traffic engineers , who put_together traffic-easing measures during the 1984 Olympics and January earthquake , also was standing by . The transit workers were set to strike last Monday but delayed the walkout for a week after Mayor Richard Riordan and other top transit officials agreed to meet with union leaders . The big sticking point has been proposed changes in work rules and contracting . The agency wants to turn_over some bus_lines to private operators , cut_back on drivers ' overtime and reduce the MTA contribution to health benefits . Union_members say contracting will eliminate some jobs . Information is available to commuters at 1-800-COMMUTE . For Metrolink : 1-800-371-LINK .</TEXT>
