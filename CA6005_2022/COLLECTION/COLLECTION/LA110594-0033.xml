   <HEADLINE> FEINSTEIN EMPLOYEE HAD PERMIT TO WORK , INS SAYS ; POLITICS : AGENCY REPORTS THAT PERMIT EXPIRED DURING IMMIGRANT ' S EMPLOYMENT BUT NO FEDERAL LAWS WERE BROKEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After several wild days of accusations and retractions in the fiercely contested U.S. Senate_race , the Immigration and Naturalization Service confirmed Friday that the woman employed by U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein as a housekeeper in the early 1980s entered the country with a legal work_permit that expired while she was still working for Feinstein . The INS said no federal laws were broken and in any case the hiring occurred years before a 1986 law made hiring illegal immigrants a crime . INS records also show that the woman ' s work visa would have limited her to working_at the Guatemalan Consulate and that the permit expired in November , 1980 -- while she was employed by Feinstein . The hiring occurred long before federal law made_it a crime to hire illegal immigrants . But throughout the day , the Santa Barbara congressman was_on the airwaves -- in commercials and television interviews -- accusing Feinstein of violating an obscure California labor law by hiring the housekeeper . Republican challenger Mike Huffington has repeatedly attacked Feinstein this past week after admitting that he and his wife had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny until last year -- long after the 1986 law that made such hiring illegal . The issue continued to frustrate Feinstein ' s campaign strategy to draw attention to her record of bipartisan support in cities and counties . In press_conferences , she maintained that the woman she hired as a housekeeper in 1980 showed her documentation that she was in the United States legally . She appeared with city and county officials in several cities who praised her record as a senator . The immigration issue was only one of a series of events in the Senate_race Friday : * In another sign of the race ' s volatility , KNBC-TV released a poll that showed Feinstein with a 16-point lead over Huffington , up 10 points from a poll two weeks ago . The 52-36 margin came only days after another poll , done_by a local television_station , showed Huffington with a 2-point lead over Feinstein . KNBC attributed its results to Huffington ' s disclosure about breaking the law by hiring the nanny . * Entering the last frantic weekend of campaigning , Feinstein traveled_to several cities while Huffington concentrated_on Los Angeles , with several television appearances . On a local cable_television program , he called Feinstein a &quot; hypocrite &quot; and accused the INS of a &quot; cover-up , &quot; though he offered no proof . * The costliest race in congressional history also got more expensive . Campaign disclosure reports showed that Huffington gave another $ 500 # 000 to his campaign , raising the total to nearly $ 28 million , which again breaks national spending records for a congressional race . Feinstein loaned her campaign $ 70 # 000 , bringing its total close to $ 11 million . * The Associated Press asked the Huffington campaign to withdraw a new commercial accusing Feinstein of breaking the law because , the wire_service said , it was quoted erroneously in the ad . The Huffington campaign refused the request . A Los Angeles City_Hall rally with President Clinton capped a day of barnstorming by Feinstein , who earlier Friday went_to Sacramento and Fresno . In Sacramento , more_than a dozen city and county officials gave so many testimonials about their support for the senator that the chilled crowd on the City_Hall steps began to thin_out before the event ended . &quot; I know that was a long litany but it is an important litany because this is my campaign . . . these press_conferences are replicated up and down the state all week beginning with Mayor Richard Riordan in Los Angeles , &quot; Feinstein said . &quot; Never in the history of this nation has there been a race like this where one person with no record and no performance . . . has spent so_much to attack and slander . Never , never , never in the history of this nation , &quot; Feinstein said . Repeating a recent theme of her campaign , Feinstein implored her supporters to turn_back Huffington ' s expensive campaign . &quot; A Senate seat cannot be bought . A Senate seat must be earned . And the way you earn it is by performing , &quot; she said . Feinstein ' s campaign was shadowed all day by the possibility that she may have misspoken about never having employed an illegal worker . And even if the circumstances differed significantly than those of her opponent , the distinction was sure to be blurred in campaigning . All day long , Huffington and his campaign accused Feinstein of lying_about the former housekeeper ' s status . The housekeeper was quoted Friday by Associated Press as insisting she was in the country legally . &quot; Yes , I was legal . I already talked with her ( Feinstein ) and I am not going_to say anything more , &quot; she said . Richard Kenney , an INS spokesman in Washington , said a woman identified as Annabella del Rosario Legrand-Cabrera Realegeno , 44 , entered the United States on Nov . 17 , 1979 , on a one-year visa that allowed her to work for the Guatemalan Consulate in San Francisco . He said that visa was good until Nov . 16 , 1980 -- months after Feinstein has said she hired the woman . Kenney said INS records show the woman ' s work authorization was limited to employment at the Guatemalan Consulate . But Kenney said it would have been very difficult for someone who was not an expert to determine what its limitations were . &quot; I don ' t know whether I would know by looking_at a passport with a visa stamp in it , and I work for the INS , &quot; Kenney said . Although the INS said the records did not suggest any violation of the law , the Huffington campaign said the information showed that Feinstein employed an illegal worker and that this constituted a violation of state law . But an expert on the law raised some doubts about the contention . &quot; There was a law on the books in the California Labor Code that technically made_it illegal to hire undocumented workers , &quot; said Kitty Calavita , a professor in the Department of Criminology , Law and Society at UC Irvine . &quot; But it effectively was a dead law . Virtually no one knew it existed . There was no enforcement machinery and there was no publicity about it. &quot; Calavita added : &quot; In contrast , the ( federal ) employer sanction law of 1986 was widely publicized and would have been hard for people not to know about. &quot; Feinstein disputed those accusations throughout the day . &quot; As I ' ve said , this was back in 1980 , the person in_question handed me documentation . . . . It looked verifiable to me . And I hired her , &quot; Feinstein told reporters as she campaigned in Northern California . At the San Francisco house where the woman now works as a housekeeper , her husband told The Times that she had entered the country legally and was permitted to work_at the time she was employed by Feinstein . Miguel Realegeno , Annabella ' s husband , also disputed Huffington ' s ads saying the housekeeper was an illegal worker . &quot; that ' s not true , &quot; Miguel Realegeno said . &quot; We are not illegal in this country . She came_with a visa . She never came here illegally . She did not work with illegal papers like they are saying on TV. &quot; Miguel Realegeno , who said he also worked for Feinstein and was a legal worker at the time , said Annabella entered the country legally in 1972 and that he met her in the early 1980s . The Feinstein campaign called_on television_stations to stop running the Huffington ad on the issue , saying it was &quot; potentially libelous. &quot; In a letter to the stations , campaign manager Kam noted that Associated Press has challenged the accuracy of the ad . Associated Press San Francisco Bureau Chief Dan Day , who faxed a letter of protest to the Huffington campaign Thursday night , said Friday the news service was asking that the ad be pulled . &quot; The erroneous information in your ad can substantially damage that reputation . Please confirm to me that you will discontinue this misrepresentation of the AP ' s reporting , &quot; Day wrote . Huffington ' s campaign declined the request . In other developments this week : * A Senate ethics complaint filed Friday contends that Feinstein would have personally benefited from her efforts to allegedly influence the Justice and Agriculture_departments to drop 34 civil fraud suits against Sunkist Growers and its members . Feinstein wrote officials this year , supporting dismissal of the whistle-blower suits , which seek $ 80 million to $ 400 million from Sunkist Growers for violating federal quotas on citrus shipments , the complaint said . The complaint alleges that Feinstein held an interest in Newhall Land &amp; Farming , which grows oranges and lemons for Sunkist -- based on Feinstein ' s 1992 financial disclosure statement showing an investment of $ 500 # 000 to $ 1 million . Her 1993 disclosure lists the investment at less than $ 1 # 000 , however . Richard Blum , Feinstein ' s husband , said one of his partnerships divested the Newhall asset in September , 1993 . The ethics complaint was filed by James Moody , an attorney for Sequoia Orange Co. , the firm that filed the whistle-blower suit against Sunkist . Ethics experts said Feinstein ' s letters appear to fall within Senate rules . Hadley Roff , Feinstein ' s staff director in California , said her letters were proper . The Justice_Department in September sought dismissal of the Sunkist case , despite having previously intervened on behalf of Sequoia . A spokesman said Feinstein ' s letter played no part in the decision . * State tax officials have questioned a former bookkeeper for the Huffington family as they opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if sales taxes of about $ 6 # 250 were paid on furnishings for the candidate ' s Montecito mansion . The inquiry was prompted by the claim of bookkeeper Claudia Bratton that Huffington ' s wife , Arianna , purchased at least $ 100 # 000 worth of chairs , draperies and other items with a tax card issued to her sister , Agapi Stassinopoulos , by the State Board of Equalization . The card allows interior_designers to buy items from wholesalers without paying sales tax , if the goods are to be resold . But if the items are for personal use , the cardholder must pay the tax .
