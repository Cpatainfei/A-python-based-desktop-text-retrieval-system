   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; ' WE LEARNED FROM THE AMERICANS ' ; HANS-DIETRICH GENSCHER , FORMER WEST GERMAN FOREIGN_MINISTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A s West German foreign_minister over a period of 18 years between 1974-1992 , Hans-Dietrich Genscher was an important figure in the events surrounding the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the rush to reunification . He remains a powerful force in German domestic politics and was recently reelected to the Bundestag . Amiable , open , and relaxed , he shook hands warmly with Times correspondents Tyler Marshall and Marjorie Miller . Then he sunk into one of the velour sofas that dominate the elegant living_room of his home outside Bonn and talked_of the events of 1989 and their meaning for the future of Europe . Question . When the Hungarians decided to roll_up part of the Iron_Curtain in the spring of 1989 and East_Germans began to cross in large_numbers from Hungary to Austria , did you and the German Cabinet see this at the time as the beginning of the end of the German Democratic Republic ( East_Germany ) ? Answer . The first_step in 1989 was the statement by ( Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard ) Shevardnadze in Vienna during a ( January ) speech to the CSCE ( Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe ) when he said that the Iron_Curtain is rusty . This was a clear signal that the Soviet leadership was aware that the division of Europe could not survive . The second step came_in May of 1989 when ( Hungary ' s then-foreign minister Gyula ) Horn and ( Austrian Foreign Minister Alois ) Mock opened the Iron_Curtain along the Hungarian-Austrian border . And the third step was the courageous decision of the Hungarian government to give permission to the Germans from the GDR to leave Hungary by crossing the Austrian-Hungarian border . * Q . Why has unification been so difficult ? A . Unification was difficult because of . . . half a century of separate development . The same country with systems so different -- one cannot imagine two systems more different than there were here in Germany . The people are not at all really different . They have a different experience over decades , and this we have to overcome . But the basic feelings for democracy , for freedom and personal identity , there is no difference . The main problem was that the economic strength of the GDR was overrated in western opinion . I always had my doubts when Western economic_experts listed the GDR as No . 7 or 8 on the list of strongest industrialized countries . I couldn ' t believe that when I saw the real situation of the people in the streets of the cities . This led to an underestimation of the problems . * Q . Did you imagine it would be this hard ? A . We had a ( Bundestag ) debate on Nov . 8 , the day before the Wall fell , on the so-called report of the German government on the state of the nation of divided Germany . In my speech I said , referring to German unification , that nothing will be as it was , not in the East but also not in the West . . . . I added that it is our responsibility to say right now , today , to Germans here ( in the West ) that they will be called_upon to make extraordinary efforts for the unity of the nation . * Q . Five years from now , when we come_back here and sit_down with you , what do you expect to be telling us ? A . I don ' t think in five years you will bother coming because you will not find the situation in Germany interesting enough . Maybe you will come_to discuss another subject in five years : How Europe is answering the same questions that Germany has already answered , if Europe as_a_whole accepts its unity . We accepted ( our unity ) , and we immediately started to solve our common problems . But in Europe , it is different . The people in the East of course accept unity , but in the West there are many people who really cannot understand that unity in Europe is a reality , that there is no alternative . * Q . But the costs are high . If many Germans don ' t want to give_up a very comfortable status_quo for other Germans , will the_French or Spanish give it up for Poles , Hungarians and others to the East ? A . They really don ' t have to give it up , in this sense . . . . We learned from the Americans . What they did after the Second_World_War is exactly what we are doing now . They helped Europe with the Marshall Plan , but what they received was far , far more . The same is happening now between western and eastern Germany , and the same will be true for Europe as_a_whole . NATO was strong enough to deter hundreds of divisions from the Warsaw Pact coming_to the West . But no NATO and no police can help when millions of eastern Europeans without any hope will come_to the West . It will be far worse for Europe if we do not , in good_faith , plan for the long-term future of all Europeans .</TEXT>
