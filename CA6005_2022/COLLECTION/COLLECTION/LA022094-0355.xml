   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; AMID QUESTIONS , PRIESTS , NUNS BACK KEY DOCTRINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a time when Pope John Paul II is calling_on wayward Roman_Catholics to hew closely to church teaching , a significant number of priests and nuns in the United States are questioning many of the church ' s edicts . Celibacy for priests , the Vatican ' s opposition to the ordination of women , and its prohibition against artificial birth_control are as likely to be disputed by priests and nuns as supported , The Times Poll has found . But despite dissent over certain issues -- none of which go_to the doctrinal core of Catholic faith -- priests and nuns are highly selective in challenging moral teachings or traditions . By overwhelming majorities , priests and nuns are in_accord with their church in its opposition to abortion , assisting in euthanasia , sexual_relations between unmarried couples , relations outside marriage , homosexual behavior and marriages between homosexual couples . And unlike members of the laity , priests and nuns view moral and spiritual issues -- not economic concerns -- as the greatest problem facing the country and families today . Loyalty to the church as an institution is high among both groups , and contrary to popular perceptions , so is their morale . When asked if they would take their vows again , 87 % of priests and 88 % of nuns said they would . Although 59 % of priests say that the church should ordain married priests , only 15 % said they would wed if permitted . The American media ' s coverage of the church was considered too negative by 84 % of priests and 71 % of nuns . Although there was wider disagreement over whether the Pope is too conservative on moral issues , he earned high ratings for his overall job performance . A 74 % majority of priests and 70 % of nuns approve of the way John Paul is handling his duties as Pope . Local bishops or the superiors of orders earned similar marks . &quot; The good news is that the much-advertised morale crisis in the priesthood affects only a small number of priests . The bad news is that a large proportion of the Catholic clergy do not accept many of the sexual teachings on which the present papacy has placed great emphasis , &quot; Father Andrew Greeley , a Catholic sociologist and author at the University of Chicago , said after analyzing The Times ' data . The results are based on written responses from 2 # 087 Roman_Catholic priests and 1 # 049 Roman_Catholic nuns in dioceses across the United States , including Puerto Rico -- a 42 % return . The survey , which was self-administered and anonymous , was conducted by mail from September , 1993 , through January . The margin of sampling error for the priests ' survey is plus or minus 3 percentage_points ; for nuns it is plus or minus 4 points . The poll sparked controversy even before it was completed . Shortly after the questionnaires were sent_out , Cardinal Roger M . Mahony , the archbishop of Los Angeles , publicly accused the newspaper of preparing to engage in &quot; the American media ' s favorite pastime -- Catholic-bashing. &quot; Mahony said he was particularly offended by questions dealing with sexual issues . Three independent experts , however , said the Times ' data is credible and significant . Although they noted that the 42 % return rate was lower than some previous samples and could result in some bias , they did not consider it a serious problem . Church sociologist Dean Hoge of Catholic University of America in Washington said : &quot; If there is a bias , it ' s not a serious bias . . . . There is nothing in this poll which is so far off as_to make me doubt the validity of the data. &quot; The striking selectivity with which priests and nuns pick and choose among church teachings and traditions comes at a time when John Paul has issued a ringing denunciation of what has come_to be called cafeteria Catholicism . Calling it a genuine crisis , the pontiff underscored his alarm in August when he issued what was described as the most important encyclical of his pontificate , &quot; Veritatis Splendor , &quot; or &quot; Splendor of the Truth. &quot; In it , John Paul warned of &quot; an overall and systematic calling_into_question of traditional moral doctrine. &quot; But in the United States , the Times Poll indicates that Catholic bishops will not have an easy time carrying_out the uncompromising directive embodied in &quot; Veritatis Splendor &quot; : &quot; To be vigilant that the word_of_God is faithfully taught &quot; and that Jesus ' commandments and teachings be &quot; reverently preserved , faithfully expounded and correctly applied in different times and places. &quot; More_than other factors , the poll found that priests and nuns were divided in their views by their age and whether they classify themselves as religious liberals , moderates or conservatives . One out of five priests -- 21 % -- say they frequently counsel Catholics to follow a course of action that contradicts official church teaching on morals , the poll found . Among priests age 35 and younger , 27 % do so , as do 29 % of priests between the ages of 36 and 50 . The oldest priests are the most orthodox , with only 10 % saying they frequently offer advice that conflicts with church teaching . Despite the Pope ' s insistence that contraception is an &quot; intrinsically evil &quot; act that cannot be mitigated by circumstances , the Times Poll found that 44 % of priests and nuns believe that artificial birth_control for married_couples is seldom or never a sin , while 49 % of priests and 37 % of nuns said it is always or often a sin . The use of condoms as protection against AIDS was seen as always or often a sin by 46 % of priests and 33 % of nuns , but 41 % of priests and 42 % of nuns held that it was seldom or never a sin . In contrast , 16 % of Catholic laity believe that using condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS is wrong , according to a CNN / USA Today Gallup Poll conducted in August . The Times also found that 84 % of priests believe that premarital sex is always or often a sin . In the August Gallup poll , 48 % of rank-and-file Catholics said sex outside marriage was always wrong . There are many reasons there is dissent over moral teachings , among them the influence of the media and the general secularization of American Catholics by the larger culture . But another , in the Pope ' s view , has been wrong-thinking theologians . Although the Pope sternly suggested in the encyclical that dissenting Catholic theologians should be barred from teaching in Catholic institutions , priests surveyed by The Times were almost evenly divided over whether U.S. bishops should issue a formal declaration of rights for dissenting American Catholic theologians . Forty-two percent of priests and 44 % of nuns favored such a declaration . &quot; Poll after poll has documented this drift away from moral orthodoxy among American Catholics , &quot; Times Poll Director John Brennan said . &quot; The current samples indicate on many moral issues , priests and nuns themselves are divided when it comes_to loyalty to church teaching. &quot; Last year , the Gallup poll found that 73 % of all Catholics said a person could be a good Catholic without obeying the church ' s teachings on birth_control . The Times found that 58 % of priests and 65 % of nuns agree that Roman_Catholics may disagree_with some of the church ' s teachings and still be considered faithful . The fact that priests and nuns may sometimes dissent from what the church considers orthodox teaching does not necessarily make them rebels . Although it is true that John Paul has placed great emphasis on the primacy of the church ' s moral teachings in deciding between good and evil , Catholic tradition has also taught the importance of an individual ' s conscience in making such choices . The conscience factor may explain in part why 21 % of priests say they frequently counsel Catholics to follow a course that contradicts church moral teaching , for example , on birth_control . &quot; It ' s not a great transgression on the part of a priest to recognize that the conscience may be a moral voice , even in a situation that seems to conflict with church teachings , &quot; said Hoge of the Life_Cycle Institute , a religious research group at Catholic University of America . The key , Hoge said , is that the conscience be &quot; well formed &quot; so that it can be a truthful guide instead of seeking selfish ends . Conscience , John Paul warned in his encyclical , &quot; is not an infallible judge ; it can make mistakes. &quot; Father Robert M . Friday , a moral theologian at Catholic University of America , said : &quot; In ( sexual ) areas , very often people have formed a conscience , say on questions of contraception . They take seriously what the church has said but have also found at a deep level of_their_own experience and conscience that there are other conflicting values , &quot; Friday said . &quot; They believe -- not just feel -- that in_order to be faithful to God and to their commitments to a spouse or their children that they need to ( use ) contraceptives. &quot; At that point , in that situation , Friday said , he would explain the church teaching , and ask if they understand the authority of the teaching . Ultimately , he said , he must tell them to follow their consciences . &quot; that ' s not saying it ' s OK to ( use ) contraceptives or it ' s OK to have an abortion , &quot; Friday said , &quot; but you must follow your conscience. &quot; But not all priestly advice or decisions by members of the laity that conflict with church moral teaching can be explained by an appeal_to conscience . &quot; One must note , &quot; Greeley said , &quot; that on these issues the official church has little credibility , even among its priests , and the efforts in the present pontificate to restore that credibility do not seem to have been particularly successful. &quot; On other sexual issues , priests and nuns are decidedly more doctrinaire than those to whom they minister . On abortion , a substantial majority -- 91 % of priests and 79 % of nuns -- say it is always or often a sin . By comparison , a Gallup poll survey published in October by the National Catholic Reporter said that 56 % of Catholic women say a person can be a good Catholic without obeying the church ' s restrictive teachings on abortion , up from 34 % in a 1987 poll by that newspaper . By a decisive 80 % to 14 % margin , priests would oppose any church-sanctioned marriage between homosexuals . Nuns oppose such unions 72 % to 14 % . The Pope is confronted by dissident priests and nuns on institutional as well as moral questions . Despite John Paul ' s oft-stated insistence on an all-male priesthood , 57 % of all nuns and 44 % of all priests support the ordination of women . This compares to 63 % of Catholic laity who favor women as priests , the Gallup poll reported in August . Despite their support for the idea of women ' s ordination , 89 % of the nuns said they would not seek it for themselves . Priests generally oppose female ordination , even though 69 % said they would like to see sexism formally declared a sin by U.S. bishops . Eight in 10 priests who are religious liberals favor ordaining women , but majorities of moderates and conservatives oppose it . Priests ages 36 to 50 favor the idea by 60 % to 35 % but priests 35 and younger are divided 46 % to 48 % . &quot; Clearly many priests are unhappy with the status of women in the church and desirous of a more aggressive posture against societal sexism . But those feelings do not necessarily translate into support for women clergy , &quot; Brennan said . Only 47 % of priests rate the status of nuns in the church as good . Sister Jeannine Gramick of Baltimore , a board_member of the unofficial Women ' s Ordination Conference , said that strong support among women for ending an all-male priesthood is a plea for equality . &quot; Women really are taking very seriously the whole idea of equality of women in the church , &quot; Gramick said . &quot; They see ordination as a prime example of how women are treated as second-class citizens in the church. &quot; When it comes_to celibacy , the Pope has steadfastly opposed allowing priests to marry . But 59 % of priests and 66 % of nuns say that priests should be allowed to marry . The idea is particularly popular_with religious liberals , moderates and middle-age clergy . The majorities of priests and nuns favoring married priests are not as large as the 75 % of Catholic laity who favor the change , according to Gallup ' s August survey . Although a majority of priests support the idea of married priests , only 15 % said they would wed if the church allowed it -- an indication that at least for most current priests , celibacy is not that big an issue for them personally . The poll suggests that marriage could be instrumental in holding a_few disaffected priests in the church , but the numbers would be relatively small . Three in five priests who are dissatisfied with their lives would still not marry if given the chance , while 35 % would contemplate marriage . Among priests who would marry if they could , 58 % still say it is unlikely they will ever leave the priesthood . Just 19 % of those desiring marriage are contemplating abandoning their vocation . There was additional evidence of the relative lack of importance of celibacy to priests . When asked to identify their top personal challenge , 3 % listed celibacy as the top problem for them . Of those generally dissatisfied with their lives , 6 % said celibacy was a big problem . That put the issue way down the list of personal challenges -- below maintaining their spiritual life , dealing with the influence of materialism and secular culture on the laity , and finding the time to meet all_the demands made of them . Greeley said the high morale factor calls into question not only the public ' s image of an unhappy priesthood , but a widely held assumption among priests that many of their colleagues are disgruntled . &quot; The much-heralded morale crisis seems almost nonexistent , &quot; Greeley said . Why then are not more men becoming priests ? &quot; It ' s a puzzling thing , isn ' t , it , &quot; Hoge of Catholic University said . &quot; I was told years ago that happy priests beget priests . . . . I don ' t know what the problem is. &quot; Two priests who volunteered to be interviewed -- one who said he would marry and another who said he would not even if the church allowed it -- agreed that optional celibacy would aid in recruiting men to the priesthood . Father Victor Lynch , 28 , was ordained two years ago and serves at St . Thomas the Apostle Church in Bloomfield , N.J. He said he would probably get_married if the church allowed it . Married priests , he said , would be a blessing to the church . Father Maurice Larochelle , 34 , pastor of All Saints Parish in Lancaster , N.H. , said he would not marry . &quot; I love being a priest and love being celibate , &quot; he said . &quot; I had a healthy dating experience before becoming a priest , but I made a choice and I honor that choice . To tell you the truth , with the life I lead now , I don ' t know if I could divide my time between a wife and kids and the church. &quot; But I think some people could do_it . That would be wonderful and that would be a good addition to the priesthood in general. &quot; NEXT : The Times Poll finds that attempts to restore orthodoxy in the Roman_Catholic_Church may be producing a new crop of more conservative priests . THE TIMES POLL : The View From Inside the Church Catholic priests and nuns are highly selective in grading the sinfulness of various acts . Most priests favor allowing clergy to marry but would not do so themselves .

Source : Times Poll of priests and nuns conducted between September , 1993 , and January , 1994 . How the Poll Was Conducted This Times Poll is based on interviews with 2 # 087 Roman_Catholic priests and 1 # 049 Roman_Catholic nuns in dioceses across the United States , including Puerto Rico . The survey was conducted by mail from September 1993 through January 1994 . It represents the response to a mailing of 5 # 000 questionnaires to priests in 80 dioceses and 2 # 500 to women religious in 45 dioceses . The samples of dioceses were chosen from a list which gives the total number of priests and nuns in all dioceses nationwide . Respondents within targeted dioceses were then chosen randomly from available lists . The questionnaires were self-administered and anonymous , though some respondents volunteered to be interviewed and quoted by name . Both samples were weighted slightly to account_for variations in the number of responses received from each diocese . The demographics of both surveys have been examined by academic experts in the field of priests and nuns sociology and have been found comparable_to previous research in this area . The margin of sampling error for the survey of priests is plus or minus 3 percentage_points ; for the survey of nuns it is plus or minus 4 points . In both polls , results based on subgroups may have a somewhat higher sampling error . Results to polls can also be affected by other factors such_as question wording and the reluctance of some respondents to participate in surveys .</TEXT>
