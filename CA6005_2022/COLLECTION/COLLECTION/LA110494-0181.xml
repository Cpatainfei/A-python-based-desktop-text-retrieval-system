   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT VICTORIES UNLIKELY TO MARK TURNING POINT IN WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This time , instead of Serbian nationalist rebels conquering territory for a Greater Serbia , it was Muslim-led government forces rolling_over huge swaths in Bosnia-Herzegovina . This time , instead of Muslim women and children being driven from their homes , it was Bosnian Serb civilians fleeing in terror from a battle in the northwestern region known as the Bihac pocket . Few analysts of the Balkan conflagration , ignited with the breakup of the Yugoslav federation , see this first major drubbing of Bosnian Serb rebels by the underdog government forces as any kind of turning point in the protracted , roving war . Rather , the more_than 100 square_miles recovered by the government army probably provides a glimpse of the deadly win-some , lose-some way of the future in a country now hopelessly trapped in a cycle of attacks and retaliation . The successful government offensive , including the apparent gain Thursday of the key western town of Kupres , also has enhanced the suspicion among many observers that the international community has lost its influence with the Bosnian combatants after too many empty threats and unfulfilled promises . The White_House has characterized the stunning government advance in the Bihac region as a legitimate counteroffensive by government forces after 31 months of being_on the receiving end of a Bosnian Serb land grab . President Clinton ' s advisers have even suggested that the blow dealt to the Bosnian Serb rebels should pressure them to accept a last-chance peace plan proposed to the combatants five months ago . But the offensive that scored the government ' s greatest victory since the Serb rebellion began in March , 1992 , suggests that the Bosnian leadership has given_up on any prospect of a fair peace plan and has chosen to use the tactics of its attackers in changing boundaries and gaining political power with brute force . That the offensive was successful this time , reportedly restoring the towns of Kulen Vakuf and Bosanska Krupa to the Muslim-led government ' s control , will probably only encourage officials in Sarajevo to spurn diplomatic initiatives ; they claim these efforts reward Bosnian Serb aggression and have prompted the Bosnian government to seek a more equitable settlement on the battlefield . Besides routing Bosnian Serb forces near Bihac , including from the village of Ripac from which the nationalist rebels had been shelling Muslim homes , government troops near Sarajevo also advanced nearly two miles toward the town of Trnovo . That has put them within striking distance of a strategic supply_route from Bosnian Serb-held territory around the capital to rebel troops and communities farther south . Flush with those successes , the government army dealt a serious setback to the Bosnian Serbs on Thursday by taking_control of at least part of Kupres , the first capture of an important town from the Serbs since the early days of the war . The takeover of the town , reported by media from all factions , was accomplished with the aid of the Bosnian Croat militia that had fought against the republic ' s Muslims for most of last year . The U.N. refugee agency was sending food , blankets and materials for temporary shelter to the Bosansko Grahovo area , where more_than 10 # 000 Serbian civilians were taking refuge , as well as_to Bosnian Serb-held territory across the nearby Croatian border , where an additional 1 # 500 refugees had gathered . Radovan Karadzic , the self-proclaimed president of Bosnia ' s rebel Serbs , has put the world on notice that he will not let the government victory pass unchallenged . &quot; Our enemy wants war , and he shall have it , &quot; vowed Karadzic , uncharacteristically clad in military garb , at a front-line rally broadcast on television throughout much of the former Yugoslav federation . &quot; This is our land and will remain so. &quot; Sarajevo , which had been spared most heavy artillery shelling since a NATO threat to bomb rebel hardware in February , last weekend suffered its deadliest attack since that ultimatum , with at least two capital residents killed and seven wounded . U.N. military sources confirmed that Serbian rebels in the disputed Krajina region of Croatia , which flanks the Bihac pocket to the west , had massed tanks and heavy guns to back the threatened counteroffensive , but that no sign of a major Bosnian Serb mobilization had been detected . The escalating conflict prompted warnings from the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia that both sides could face punitive air strikes unless they ceased their offensives . Serbian shelling of Sarajevo underscores the rebels ' blatant violation of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ultimatum under which all heavy artillery was to have been withdrawn from a 12-mile radius of the capital or be subject_to destruction from the air . Lt . Col . Tim Spicer , the U.N. mission spokesman in Sarajevo , accused the government of attacking French peacekeepers in a supposedly demilitarized zone as the Muslim-led troops prepared their advance on nearby Serbian gunmen . While Spicer said the bellicose behavior of both sides could provoke a U.N. call_for NATO air strikes , neither the government nor the Bosnian Serbs appeared to take the oft-repeated warning seriously . American government officials have indicated that they would be unlikely to support NATO action against Bosnian government troops for waging what some observers consider a legitimate campaign to recover lost territory . Karadzic reiterated that the U.N. threats were only further dissuading his rebels from considering any negotiated peace plan . In July , Bosnia ' s predominantly Muslim government and Parliament reluctantly gave their consent to a five-nation formula for bringing peace to the shattered country . But that endorsement was said to be contingent_on Bosnian Serb acceptance of the plan , which would split Bosnia in two nearly equal pieces , with 51 % of the territory restored to government control and 49 % left to the Bosnian Serb nationalists who have seized it . But Karadzic and his arch-nationalist military chieftain , Gen . Ratko Mladic , have refused to endorse any deal that would compel them to give_up territory or their claimed right to join their land to the republic of Serbia . Karadzic and Mladic have also been identified as potential subjects for a war_crimes tribunal and the prospect of being handed_over for prosecution may also be encouraging them to press_on with the war . With the Bosnian Serbs still decidedly better armed than the government , the threatened counteroffensive could roll back the recent shifts in territory . One incalculable factor , however , is the degree to which heavily armed Croatia may be supporting the Bosnian government offensives . A March agreement brokered by Washington ended the devastating yearlong war-within-a-war between Bosnia ' s Muslims and Croats . But to date there had been little evidence of cooperation between the erstwhile enemies to combat their common foe , the Bosnian Serbs . If Croatia has been funneling arms and troops to bolster the recent Bosnian government offensives , they could continue to eat_away at the rebel Serb occupation of 70 % of the republic ' s territory . But with the huge arsenal of tanks , heavy guns , helicopters and warplanes inherited by the Bosnian Serbs from the Yugoslav People ' s Army , few analysts believe the government could consistently push_back the entrenched Serbian forces .</TEXT>
