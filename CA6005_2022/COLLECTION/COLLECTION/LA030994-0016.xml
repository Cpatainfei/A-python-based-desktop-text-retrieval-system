   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEWS ; ' THE REF ' : RAZOR-SHARP ; ANCHORED BY EXPERT PERFORMANCES AND A BITING SCRIPT AND DIRECTION , THE TOUCHSTONE RELEASE CARRIES A MEAN VERBAL STILETTO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The Ref &quot; ( citywide ) puts the_devil into business with Disney . An enthusiastically mean-spirited comedy about family problems and a rather extreme way to solve them , it has as much fun being malicious as Snow White did being squeaky clean . Anchored by expert performances from Denis Leary , Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey and the appropriately biting script and direction , &quot; The Ref &quot; is one of those films in which everyone has a verbal stiletto out for everyone else . Though it doesn ' t manage to hold its edge all_the way to the end -- that darn Disney influence finally proves too strong -- its comic venom is refreshing for as long as it lasts . &quot; The Ref ' s &quot; setting couldn ' t be more mainstream : the Norman Rockwell town of Old Baybrook , Conn. , on the night before Christmas . Several creatures are stirring , including a skilled cat_burglar named Gus ( Leary ) , hoping to make the proverbial last big score , and the Chasseurs , Lloyd ( Spacey ) and Caroline ( Davis ) , a couple that after 15 years of marriage can ' t go 15 seconds without attempting to rip each other ' s throats out . Squaring_off before the blissful local marriage counselor ( a just-so performance by an unbilled B . D . Wong ) the Chasseurs engage in some dazzlingly hostile bickering , tossing knives at each other like an experienced circus act . First prize goes_to Caroline for her vivid description of a dream in which various parts of her husband ' s anatomy are served_up like a salad , but Lloyd is not without verbal resources of_his_own . Meanwhile , Gus ' robbery is going comically wrong , and he ends_up needing a house to hide_out in to avoid a police dragnet . Naturally he ends_up with the Chasseurs , who are so bilious they keep_on eviscerating each other even though their lives are in danger . &quot; Oh my God , &quot; says Gus when he realizes what he ' s into . &quot; I hijacked my parents. &quot; The best part of &quot; The Ref &quot; involves this neat reversal of expectations , with the nominal hostage-taker ending_up at the mercy of the out-of-control hostages , with Gus having no choice but to attempt to bring order out of the Chasseurs ' chaos . &quot; The only person who yells is me , &quot; he screams in exasperation , brandishing his weapon . &quot; Only people with guns get_to yell. &quot; That line is typical of the dark spirit screenwriters Richard LaGravenese and Marie Weiss bring_to &quot; The Ref , &quot; a spirit that director Ted Demme , who recently did a Leary concert film , is not shy about conveying . And aside from the forever out-of-sorts comic , well cast as the exasperated burglar , &quot; The Ref &quot; benefits from having actor ' s actors like Davis and Spacey in_the_leads . Both are impeccable , but not even Spacey can match the panache of Davis when she disdainfully calls sex with her husband &quot; not really noteworthy. &quot; Forcing Gus to referee the Chasseurs ' marital battles is a clever conceit , and even though other elements of the film are amusing -- like a Keystone Kops police_force that would rather watch &quot; It ' s a Wonderful Life &quot; than solve crime -- when the picture strays from that central premise it tends to lose comic focus . &quot; The Ref ' s &quot; main subplots have to do with who is coming_to the Chasseur ' s Christmas_Eve dinner , everyone from bad-seed teen-age son Jesse ( Robert J . Steinmiller Jr. ) to the rest of Lloyd ' s family , especially his rich and grasping mother Rose ( Glynis Johns ) and Connie the relentless in-law ( Christine Baranski ) . Both Johns and Baranski are quite funny , but this flatter-the-rich-relative plot doesn ' t have the originality and bite of the rest of the picture and echoes the main outlines of the just-released and much less amusing &quot; Greedy. &quot; &quot; The Ref &quot; gets_it into its head to actually solve all_of the Chasseur family ' s multifarious problems -- in a typical Touchstone / Disney sort of manner -- which is a nice thought except that it forces several of the actors to make regrettably serious speeches . Still , it ' s not every movie that can create so_much comedy out of misery , and it ' s &quot; The Ref ' s &quot; bad intentions that finally carry the day . * ' The Ref ' Denis Leary : Gus Judy Davis : Caroline Kevin Spacey : Lloyd Robert J .
