   <HEADLINE> STAGEHANDS MAY PICKET ' THREE TENORS ' CONCERT ; LABOR : KEY ISSUE IS UNION WAGES FOR WORKERS AT THE JULY 16 DODGER STADIUM EVENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A labor dispute between the local stagehands union and producers of &quot; Encore ! The Three Tenors &quot; concert at Dodger Stadium may result in a picket_line greeting the expected sold-out audience . The concert , set for July 16 , the evening before the World Cup championship soccer match , features world-class tenors Jose Carreras , Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti , with Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic . Attorneys for Local 33 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees are concerned that the concert producers may hire stagehands at non-union wages to work alongside stagehands working under an agreement between the union and the Philharmonic . Union attorneys faxed a three-page letter to &quot; Tenors &quot; impresario Tibor Rudas on Tuesday informing him of &quot; certain problems &quot; between IATSE and Rudas representatives , to tell him of existing collective-bargaining agreements covering stagehand work for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and to ask what Rudas plans to pay additional stagehands at the Dodger Stadium event . Local 33 Business Representative John F . Beringhele has for several weeks been attempting to work_out an agreement to cover wages , hours and other conditions for the staging of the event , says attorney Bob Cantore . If the union finds that wages and benefits being paid stagehands are less than would be the case by union standards , Cantore says , &quot; the union will peacefully picket and inform the public through leaflets that they have paid_up to $ 1 # 000 for tickets and the producer is then paying substandard wages with all_of that money. &quot; The stagehands union , which has 1 # 200 members in Los Angeles County , has done other concert work_at Dodger Stadium , Cantore says , as well as when singers Carreras and Domingo appeared at the Greek Theatre and Music Center Opera , respectively . The Los Angeles Philharmonic is proceeding with_respect_to this performance just as it does_in respect_to others done away from the Music Center complex and Hollywood Bowl , says Dennis Vaughn , the lawyer representing the Philharmonic in this matter . The orchestra &quot; is employing stagehands in a normal fashion , under the collective-bargaining agreement. &quot; Vaughn confirmed that he had spoken with IATSE attorney Cantore , however . &quot; We discussed our respective positions about the union ' s claims about work_at the performance . Naturally , the Philharmonic wants and expects to see the show go_forward on a normal and undisturbed basis . Certainly we don ' t believe that the picketing activity should be conducted , and have so advised the union. &quot; The IATSE board will take all this under_consideration at a Tuesday board_meeting , Cantore says , and he agreed to let Vaughn know their decision then , if not sooner . &quot; We have a longstanding relationship with the Philharmonic , &quot; Cantore says . &quot; It was never our intent to put them in the middle of the thing. &quot; Asked about demands made by Local 33 , &quot; Tenors &quot; concert general_manager Wayne Baruch would say only the following : &quot; We are following all normal and legal procedures and producing the show according to the highest possible standards. &quot; Nobody at the Rudas Organization will discuss expected concert income , but reliable sources estimate it could gross $ 12.5 million to $ 15 million should it sell_out . More_than 40 # 000 seats at $ 15 to $ 150 reportedly sold_out long ago , but an undisclosed number of tickets at $ 300 and up are still on the market . Baruch would say only that &quot; very few &quot; tickets remained for_sale . Ticket sales were apparently also an issue in the cancellation of Elizabeth Taylor ' s post-concert supper to raise funds for AIDS-related services . The actress sent a fax to The Times saying that she &quot; did not realize &quot; the face_value of each concert ticket would not reach her foundation . Taylor ' s foundation had been offering packages ranging from $ 2 # 500 to $ 5 # 000 , which included concert and dinner tickets . Baruch declined to comment , saying he had not seen Taylor ' s fax .</TEXT>
