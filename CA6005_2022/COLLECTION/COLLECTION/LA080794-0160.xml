   <TEXT> When &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; comes_to home video on Aug . 17 , it won ' t be accompanied by the array of never-before-seen sequences and behind-the-scenes glimpses that have become part of many &quot; event &quot; video releases . After all , how do you improve upon what many consider to be perfection ? &quot; When a movie has won this many awards and has been shown the respect and honor that this has , &quot; observes Andrew Kairey , senior_vice_president of marketing and sales for MCA / Universal Home Video , &quot; it ' s kind of hard to go_back to it and say , ' I want to make_it better. ' &quot; &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; Steven Spielberg ' s sobering , resonant epic of Nazi war profiteer Oskar Schindler and his most unexpected act of heroism -- rescuing 1 # 100 Jews from certain death in Nazi concentration_camps -- won seven Academy Awards , including best picture and best director , and was named best picture of 1993 by every major critics group as well as the Golden Globes and the_British Academy Awards . Beyond the accolades , it offered definitive proof that Spielberg , the acknowledged master of popcorn movies , was likewise capable of tackling difficult adult material -- his previous efforts in that arena had always been considered compromised or flawed in some fashion . I t was also a proud moment for the film_industry in_general , as Universal proved that a film examining such a delicate subject could be made , marketed and distributed with remarkable sensitivity and without &quot; Hollywooding &quot; it up . Which is not to say that &quot; Schindler &quot; won ' t find its way to video without some hoopla . A special collector ' s edition , retailing for $ 139.98 , will include a letter from Spielberg , an exclusive pictorial book of photos from the production , a copy of Thomas Keneally ' s original novel and a special-edition compact_disc of John Williams ' Oscar-winning soundtrack , packaged in a coffee-table-style linen slipcase . Each set will be individually numbered , up_to 100 # 000 . Otherwise , &quot; Schindler &quot; will be priced for rental rather than ownership , although Kairey expects some video stores will offer the double-cassette package for_sale for just under $ 100 . Rental copies of the film will be available in both letterboxed and full-frame versions ; the collector ' s edition will come only in a letterboxed version . Spielberg and Oscar-winning director of photography Janusz Kaminski spent a month on the film-to-video transfer to ensure that the 3-hour , 17-minute film looks as vivid on video as it did_in theaters . There were no technical glitches in the video transfer of the sort endured during the theatrical release , which found some projectionists around the country inexperienced in dealing with the thinner black-and-white celluloid . &quot; It ' s much easier to intercut black-and-white and color footage on videotape than it is in theaters , &quot; says Mike Fitzgerald of MCA / Universal Home Video , who helped oversee the video transfer of the film with Spielberg and Kaminski . Still , it ' s no picnic : &quot; You have to time and grade the film in a scene-by-scene process to check that the density of the dark and light spots of the image are the same as on the original answer print . At every cut , you take time_out to make_sure the transfer resembles the answer print , and then you go on. &quot; Since its release last Christmas , &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; has grossed about $ 96 million in the United States and more_than $ 300 million worldwide . Even after the video release , the film will remain in limited theatrical release , Kairey said . &quot; There ' s no emphasis to get_it to $ 100 million , &quot; he said , &quot; but we want to expose it to as_many people as possible , and there are still schools and civic groups who ask us to set_up screenings in theaters. &quot; A dvertising for the video re lease , which began Aug . 1 , positions the film as a &quot; must-see event &quot; to be viewed with other family members , Kairey said . After the release , TV commercials focusing_on the collector ' s edition will be added_to the mix . Kairey added that print advertising will be expanded beyond the usual sources and entertainment and performing-arts publications to include such special-interest outlets as Jewish newspapers . Laser disc versions of the film will be released Sept . 21 , with the Limited Collector ' s Edition also retailing for $ 139.98 and the regular edition for $ 49.98. Both of these will be letterboxed . &quot; Steven Spielberg has been involved in every aspect of the video release , &quot; Kairey said . &quot; Whether he will add footage in a special release down the road is a decision he has to make. &quot; *</TEXT>
