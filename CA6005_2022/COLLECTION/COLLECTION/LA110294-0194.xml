   <TEXT> Jim Mahoney , design fabrication manager for Gridcore Systems International , recently took some six-pack containers and shredded newspapers and made a podium for his bosses . On Tuesday in Long_Beach , Gridcore President Robert Noble stood at that podium to dedicate a factory for the production of a new building panel called Gridcore , which is made entirely from consumer waste . Gridcore says its new panels are inexpensive and environmentally safe , stronger and lighter than plywood -- and sure to promote recycling efforts . They are being used in furniture , movie sets and stage displays , and Noble says they could fundamentally alter the way buildings are made . &quot; The future ( for the panels ) is in residential building construction , &quot; Noble said . His company is spending $ 5 million over the next three years to develop Gridcore houses , in which everything , including the furniture and cabinets , will be made with Gridcore panels . &quot; The entire building will end_up being less expensive than comparable building methods , &quot; Noble said , and thus could eventually help provide families with adequate low-income housing . The panels are made in a four-step process . First , old corrugated_cardboard , six-pack containers , newsprint and wood waste are mixed with water in a 20-foot-high machine akin to a blender . This creates a pulp that is 99 % water and 1 % fiber . A one-inch-thick layer of the pulp is then poured onto a 4-by-10-foot honeycomb mold , where the water is sucked out from underneath . This leaves a wet mat similar to that produced in paper making . The mat is then pressed under intense heat to form hydrogen_bonds between the fibers , which makes_it stronger . One side of the mat is flat and the other side has sturdy ridges from the honeycomb mold . Two of the 4-by-10 sheets are then glued together and pressed for 45 minutes with the ridges facing each other to further strengthen the panel , creating what looks_like a honeycomb sandwich . The panel is then ready for manufacturing use , and can be painted and laminated just like wood , according to Mahoney . Carlsbad , Calif.-based Gridcore has contracts with the Ikea furniture chain , Gap clothing_stores and nearly 100 other companies . Noble said customers are enthusiastic about using a product that will reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills . The panels , originally called &quot; spaceboard , &quot; were developed by the U.S. Agriculture_Department ' s Forest Products Laboratory , and Gridcore and two other companies bought the rights to the technology . The Long_Beach factory , which opened in April , is projected to reach full capacity in March and produce 10 times the amount of panels it is producing now , said David Saltman , Gridcore ' s vice_president of marketing and sales . There are already plans to expand the site , which now employs 21 people . On Tuesday , Long_Beach Mayor Beverly O ' Neal , whose office pushed aggressively for Gridcore to build a factory there , was awarded a light-green key to the Gridcore world -- one made of a panel produced from tattered paper_currency supplied by the Federal_Reserve_System .</TEXT>
