   <HEADLINE> STUMPING FOR CANADA ' S CONSERVATIVES ; JEAN CHAREST HAS THE FORMIDABLE TASK OF REBUILDING SUPPORT FOR HIS PARTY , WHICH LOST ALL BUT TWO PARLIAMENTARY SEATS IN THE LAST ELECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jean Charest might be forgiven if he feels a bit like the man who inherits the family mansion when a favorite aunt dies -- and arrives to find the house burned to the ground . Charest , 35 , is the new leader of Canada ' s Progressive Conservative_Party , and it has fallen to him to rebuild on the wreckage left by his two predecessors , former Prime_Ministers Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell . Charest first sought the party leadership in June , 1993 , when Mulroney gave_up the post after 10 years . He lost to Campbell , who made history by becoming Canada ' s first woman prime_minister . Four months later , Campbell made history again -- by leading her party to the worst election defeat ever in Canadian politics . The Liberal_Party , led by Jean Chretien , swept to power , and of the 152 Conservatives in Parliament , only Charest and Elsie Wayne of New Brunswick survived . Campbell lost in her own district and was pushed_out of the party leadership just before Christmas . Enter Charest . His rise surprised few in Canadian politics . A Quebecker who represents the Eastern Townships region southeast of Montreal , Charest is widely praised as thoughtful , moderate , articulate and ambitious -- a bright star in a new generation of Canadian political_leaders . But few envy him his current task . Charest not only must rebuild on a depleted base -- current polls show Chretien ' s national popularity in the 60 % range , with the Conservatives barely registering -- but must do so with a huge campaign debt . He also has new competition on the Canadian right in the Western-based Reform Party led by Preston Manning of Alberta . Charest lacks even a consistent voice in Parliament . With only two members , the Conservatives receive no automatic recognition at &quot; Question Time , &quot; the daily ritual in which the opposition puts the government in the hot_seat and wins news media attention . * So , rather than sit quietly on a parliamentary back bench in Ottawa , Charest has taken_to the road , speaking at party fund-raising dinners across the country , bucking_up the troops and formulating a comeback strategy . He plans to popularize the party by giving individual members more power and to intellectually anchor it with a permanent policy branch , a sort of in-house think_tank . The Conservatives still have a nationwide voter base and organization to build_on , he said . The Reform Party , in contrast , is just beginning to move_out of its Western base and is handicapped by an unimpressive performance in Parliament thus far . But Charest ' s best opportunity may come_in his home province , where surveys show he is the most effective spokesman for Canadian unity . If , as_many here expect , Quebeckers are presented with a referendum on independence within a year , Charest plans to play a lead role in the campaign against it . Should the referendum be defeated , Charest could emerge as &quot; one of the most popular politicians in Canada , &quot; said Michael Meighen , a former president of the Progressive Conservatives and admitted Charest fan . Of course , not everyone foresees such a comeback . Manning , for example , believes Charest badly underestimates the profound repudiation that the last election represented for the Conservatives . The precipitous fall of the Conservatives has a certain comic effect as well . A weekly program of political satire on CBC radio recently featured a sketch depicting Charest as addressing a dinner gathering of the party faithful at a McDonald ' s -- and repeatedly interrupting his speech to take hamburger orders . How Far It Fell Results of Canada ' s last three national elections show the fall of the Progressive Conservative_Party , compared with the country ' s other major parties . Breakdown of election results by political_party : October , 1993 Liberals : 177 seats Progressive Conservatives : 2 New Democratic Party : 9 Bloc Quebecois : 54 Reform Party : 52 Total : 295 seats * November , 1988 Liberals : 83 seats Progressive Conservatives : 169 New Democratic Party : 43 Total : 295 seats September , 1984 Liberals : 40 seats Progressive Conservatives : 211 New Democratic Party : 30 Totals : 282 seats * * Includes one seat held by another party Source : Elections Canada</TEXT>
