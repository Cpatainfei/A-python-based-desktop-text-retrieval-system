   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : INTERNET USERS ! READ NOW TO LEARN OF UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY !</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The citizens of cyberspace are shocked ! Outraged ! Appalled ! Barbarians have breached The Net and that could mean The End of Civilization as They Know It . The horror , the horror . . . Cavalierly exploiting the laid-back , laissez-faire culture of the Internet , an Arizona law_firm earned the enmity of the entire cyberspace community by broadcasting an unsolicited electronic_mail advertisement to more_than 5 # 000 Usenet groups , which are basically electronic_bulletin_boards for subjects ranging from the Postal Service to pet birds . The firm was trolling for green_card applicants in need of legal help . That only a fraction of the vast Internet audience would be interested in this message was beside the point . Given that through the vagaries of Internet pricing , the advertisement could reach millions at the cost of mere pennies , the lawyers got a heck of a direct-mail buy . But for a culture where commerce is supposed to be an act between consenting adults and not a trespass into personal conversations , the Internet community -- the prototype of tomorrow ' s interactive masses -- viewed the green_card ad as the sort of boorish , unsanitary act one associates with tinkling in a public pool or passing gas in a crowded elevator . The law_firm undeniably got some business . However , thousands of Usenet participants sent angry e-mail to the lawyers , condemning the intrusion . For its premeditated violations of Internet protocol , the law_firm was disconnected from the Net . Naturally , the law_firm threatened to sue to get_back on . America is truly a great country . The New York Times reports that the lawyer responsible_for the green_card ad is unrepentant and quotes him as saying , &quot; We will definitely advertise on the Internet again. &quot; Now , this conflict has been portrayed as a clash between the commercial values of ruthless entrepreneurs and the &quot; information wants to be free &quot; Twinkies-and-Jolt-Cola values of the hackers . that ' s nonsense . This clash isn ' t even about the future of &quot; netiquette &quot; or why it ' s a pity that , in cyberspace , it ' s so easy for jerks to express themselves on a global scale . No , this is really a story about what kind of networks we want , who gets_to have access and why . Now , we certainly don ' t allow the telemarketers and obscene phone callers to determine how we use our phone_system . Do we really want to allow the excesses of the exploiters and the parasites to define the dimensions of our computer_network interactions ? Or does_it perhaps make more sense to design networks that can profitably coexist as both marketplaces and communities ? The green_card tale merely confirms what we all know : We need public networks that neither subsidize bad behavior nor penalize people who are going_about minding their own business . Networks must respect the boundaries of personal privacy while offering the potential for reaching_out to those unknown . Fortunately , that ' s not nearly as difficult as it sounds . For example , there ' s a simple way to handle pseudo-entrepreneurial law_firms that want to turn the Internet into the world ' s largest direct e-mail medium : Create the equivalent of e-mail stamps and charge people a per-message fee . The discipline of a pricing mechanism would go_a_long_way toward preventing a recurrence of the excesses of the green_card ad . But there ' s another market mechanism that offers even greater potential for striking a better communications balance . Every Internet message that is sent_out has a &quot; header &quot; that describes something about its origin : who is sending it , where it ' s from and so on . It would be a straightforward matter of simple programming to make the header do a little more work . For example , instead of simply listing name and origin , headers could also list whether the message is solicited or unsolicited ; it could mention whether the message is commercial or private . Recipients could then program their mailboxes to screen_out unsolicited commercial_messages or even seek_out commercial_messages on topics they ' re interested in -- say , how to get a green_card . Ultimately , what you ' d have is a thriving market in software filters , screens and agents to get the information you want and get_rid_of the messages you want to avoid . In many corporations today , individuals use &quot; bozo filters &quot; to screen_out e-mail from unwanted senders . And Usenet users can use a &quot; kill &quot; feature to block_out postings from any e-mail address . Soon , Usenet groups and individuals who wanted to get commercial solicitations could design filters that let those queries in ; bulletin_boards that didn ' t want_ads could easily block them out . ( The design of software agents and screens is one of the hottest areas of computerdom. ) Of course , this system requires people who send messages to accurately describe them in the header . In other words , it requires truth in labeling . Now , you couldn ' t imagine a lawyer improperly or inaccurately labeling a network solicitation , could you ? That would be unethical . In the future , it should also be illegal . Fine the abusers and kick them off the Net . Think_of it as the Information Age counterpart to mail_fraud . The Internet may well be the most fertile development and testing ground for the development of software agents and filters for the future . This kind of experimentation should be encouraged . You can be sure that these kinds of filters and agents will eventually find their way onto tomorrow ' s interactive cable networks as well . So instead of treating the green_card episode as the end of the open Internet era , let ' s use it as the opportunity to build a network infrastructure that gives people the power to create new choices in a new marketplace of messages .</TEXT>
