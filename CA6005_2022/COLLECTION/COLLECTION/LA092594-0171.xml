   <HEADLINE> HAITI : CAN WE ' DO THE RIGHT THING ' ? ; THE CARTERIZATION OF CLINTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a picture of a carnival procession , men , women and children wearing bright masks . Of a morning . . . The harsh colors gave an impression of gaiety , the drummers and trumpeters seemed about to play a lively air . Only when you came closer you saw how ugly the masks were and how the masquers surrounded a cadaver in grave-clothes ; then the primitive colors went flat . . . Wherever that picture hung , I would feel Haiti close to me . Graham Greene , &quot; The Comedians &quot; 1965 Americans have always been of two minds about Jimmy_Carter . We admire his decency , integrity and moral courage ; he ' s a good preacher . But he ' s also feckless , naive and ineffectual ; he ' s a lousy leader . Guess what ? Carter ' s done_it again . On Monday , he looked_like a triumphant peacemaker . On Tuesday , he looked_like a fool . And look what he did to President Bill_Clinton . In his Sept . 15 speech to the nation , Clinton accused the Haitian military regime of creating a &quot; reign_of_terror . . . executing children , raping women , killing priests. &quot; &quot; Let me be clear , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible_for this suffering and terrible human tragedy. &quot; Three days later , we signed an agreement , brokered by Carter and approved by Clinton , that commits U.S. forces to work &quot; in close cooperation &quot; and &quot; with mutual respect &quot; with Haiti ' s military and police_forces . We saw what that meant Tuesday . As Haitians gathered to celebrate the arrival of U.S. troops , Haitian police attacked them with whips and rifle_butts . At least two demonstrators were clubbed to death . U.S. troops stood_by and watched in disgust . That , apparently , is &quot; mutual respect. &quot; &quot; We don ' t want to create an &quot; in-your-face &quot; atmosphere , &quot; a Defense_Department official said . &quot; What you really want to do is co-opt them over time. &quot; Sure . that ' s exactly how you deal with thugs and murderers . Most Americans believe Clinton is a good and decent man who wants to do the right thing . But according to the Gallup poll , the perception has been growing all year that Clinton &quot; can ' t get the job done. &quot; The public is divided over whether he ' s &quot; tough enough for the job. &quot; In other words , the Carterization of Bill_Clinton continues . Haiti was an enormous gamble on Clinton ' s part . He was out there all alone . The public opposed sending troops to Haiti . Congress was in open revolt . The President didn ' t even have his own party behind him . Americans are not isolationists . The U.S. public has two objectives in world affairs . One is to do_good . The other is to stay out of trouble . The problem is , every time we try to do_good , we end_up getting_in trouble . At the end of 1992 , Americans supported intervention in Somalia to save people from starvation . We wanted to do_good . And last week , according to the polls , Clinton persuaded Americans it was worth sending U.S. troops to Haiti to stop abuses of human_rights . So why did the public oppose sending U.S. troops ? Not because Americans didn ' t want to do_good , but because they weren ' t convinced it would work . Americans believe military_missions should have a military purpose : to drive Iraq out of Kuwait , to deliver food to starving people . We want a problem we can solve , quickly and decisively , like the Persian_Gulf . If it looks_like we ' re getting involved in another country ' s politics and Americans start getting killed , public support collapses , as it did_in Somalia . The smartest thing George_Bush ever did as President was not to take Gen . H . Norman Schwarzkopf ' s advice and overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . If we had , the United States would have been responsible_for everything that happened in Iraqi politics . In Somalia , we pretended the famine was some kind of natural disaster , like an earthquake . We discovered pretty quickly what we should have known all along -- the famine was caused by politics . There was no way we could solve the problem without entangling ourselves in Somali politics . The minute that happened , we were out of there . There is no way we can solve Haiti ' s problems without becoming entangled in Haitian politics . Sen . Dan Coats ( R-Ind. ) calls it &quot; gunboat liberalism. &quot; The minute we install Aristide as president , he becomes our man . And we become responsible_for everything that happens in Haiti . that ' s what gets us in_trouble . So Carter came_to the rescue . He made a last-minute deal with the Haitian military . The initial response , from the American public and from Congress , was relief . For about a day , it looked_like it might even be a diplomatic triumph for Clinton -- his Cuban missile crisis . We went eyeball-to-eyeball , and they blinked . Clinton said the military rulers of Haiti would go , and they promised to go . Of course , they promised the same thing last year , too -- so don ' t celebrate yet . Did the crisis make Clinton look tough ? Well , the Haitian military rulers didn ' t believe his threats until the last possible minute . He had to go_to extraordinary lengths to prove the United States was serious about using force . They only believed us when , according to Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , our forces were &quot; cocked , primed and ready to go. &quot; Clinton had to send a former President , a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff and the current chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee to prove he meant business . Remember Theodore Roosevelt ' s &quot; Talk softly , and carry a big stick &quot; ? that ' s what we did_in Haiti . But it was Carter who talked softly . Gen . Colin L . Powell carried the big stick . Haiti was not the Cuban missile crisis . Without a Cold_War , how could it be ? Haiti is a weak and impoverished country , not backed by any rival superpower . There is no nuclear threat , no threat of a world_war . The Cuban missile crisis was exactly the kind of foreign_policy Americans like . The United States threatened , the Soviets backed_down and it was over . We never had to go_into Cuba . But look where we are now . In Haiti . In the middle of Haitian politics . that ' s why , even after the deal was announced , Americans still said they opposed sending U.S. troops into Haiti . The U.S. military has always resisted the notion that our troops can perform a police function . that ' s why they were first told not to interfere as Haitians were brutalized by police_forces . But by Thursday , troops were told they could step_in . What the public is saying is , &quot; How did we get involved in the first place ? &quot; Ask Carter . Carter said he told Cedras he was embarrassed by U.S. policy toward Haiti , particularly the embargo . &quot; I made a very emotional speech , &quot; Carter said in Atlanta Monday night . &quot; I was ashamed of my country ' s policy. &quot; So he drew_up an agreement allowing the military rulers to remain in office until Oct . 15 . And with no requirement that they leave Haiti . Carter called it &quot; a serious violation of inherent human_rights for a citizen to be forced into exile. &quot; The agreement also calls_for a general amnesty for the military . Clinton accepted the deal . Now it ' s under_attack from all sides . Jean-Bertrand Aristide has refused to endorse it . Randall Robinson , the activist whose hunger_strike moved Clinton to act_on Haiti , denounced the deal , saying , &quot; It ' s tantamount_to ending World_War_II and telling Nazi war_criminals they ' re welcome to stay with their assets and with amnesty and work with the Germans to try to re-establish democracy. &quot; Conservative Rush Limbaugh put it succinctly : &quot; Cedras is clearly the winner. &quot; Well , it was never Carter ' s intention to make him feel_like a loser . Last week , The Los Angeles Times published the transcript of a phone conversation between Carter and Cedras , in which Carter invited Cedras to teach at his Sunday_school . &quot; Rosalynn sometimes says that I ' m too sympathetic to people who are unsavory , &quot; Carter told the New York Times , &quot; but I have to understand their position. &quot; In the course of that horrifying interview , Carter acknowledged that back in 1990 , he wrote every member of the U.N. Security_Council -- except Margaret Thatcher -- urging them to vote against the resolution authorizing the use of force in the Persian_Gulf . He said , &quot; I sent President Bush a copy so I would n ' t go behind the President ' s back. &quot; Carter also told the New York Times , &quot; The key to Cedras ' s decision was his wife . Mrs . Cedras was impressive , powerful and forceful . And attractive . She was slim and very attractive. &quot; It ' s the same old Carter . He still lusting in his heart after women .</TEXT>
