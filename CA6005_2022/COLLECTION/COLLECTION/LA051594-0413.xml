   <TEXT> Gambling was to have been banned on all cruise_ships off Alaska this year , but last week a last-minute bill was passed_by both of the state ' s legislative houses that would allow the floating casinos to continue operating while in coastal waters . At press time Wednesday the bill was headed for the governor ' s office.The bill will go_into effect immediately if Gov . Walter J . Hickel signs it within 20 days of receiving it . Alaska has not allowed gambling since 1978 , but some foreign-flagged ships ( which include most cruise_ships ) have been ignoring the ban . The U.S. Attorney last summer ordered cruise_ships to close casinos while in Alaskan waters . Although the new legislation would allow shipboard gambling , it imposes several restrictions . Casinos could be open on those ships with at least 300 berths , and those that are primarily involved in sightseeing and provide gambling only as an ancillary activity and only to ticketed passengers . They would have to close their casinos when in port . Cruise_ships must receive an exemption from the state to offer gambling at fees ranging from $ 10 # 000 to $ 40 # 000 per ship per year . The cost will be worth it , said Ray Pedersen , president of Princess Tours , a division of Princess Cruises which is based in Seattle and handles land arrangements for the cruise line . The company worked to have the legislation introduced . Although sightseeing is the main reason most travelers cruise to Alaska , Pedersen said , gambling is a draw and if it ' s not available travelers may opt_for other cruise destinations .</TEXT>
