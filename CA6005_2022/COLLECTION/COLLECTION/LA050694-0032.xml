   <HEADLINE> MORE HEAT ON HAITI ' S COHORTS ; THOSE CIRCUMVENTING SANCTIONS MUST BE TARGETED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States today will ask the U.N. Security_Council to renew economic sanctions against Haiti and the military junta that refuses to allow exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return . But new sanctions will be no more successful than previous ones unless both the United Nations and Washington come_down hard on any countries that try to get_around them . For more_than two years the military and police officials who seized control of the government in Port-au-Prince have held virtually the entire world at_bay by playing cynical diplomatic games . They went so far as_to negotiate an agreement for Aristide to return last October ; then , at the last moment , they reneged , humiliating the Clinton_Administration when a boatload of unarmed U.S. troops sent to help enforce the agreement was prevented from landing by a pro-junta mob . As illustrated in that incident , the United States is reluctant -- understandably -- to use force against a much weaker nation . And both the United States and the United Nations have been hesitant to impose truly harsh economic sanctions against one of the poorest nations in the Western_Hemisphere . Last Tuesday President Clinton may have set himself up for another humiliation when he publicly announced he is considering military_force as an option for resolving the Haitian crisis . Tough talk like that should not be used unless Washington really means it , and experience in both Haiti and Bosnia suggests it does not . Economic sanctions remain the only real option . Arguments that sanctions hurt only Haiti ' s poor are disingenuous . The poor , the vast majority of Haitians , already are suffering , not just from poverty but from repression by a government desperately afraid of ceding power to any popularly elected civilian . Sanctions can be targeted on the military and the small elite class . The new sanctions proposal seems to do that , banning travel outside Haiti by 600 top officials and government supporters and freezing their financial assets abroad . The United Nations must also be prepared to pressure the Dominican_Republic , which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti . A recent U.N. report concedes that past sanctions against Haiti were ineffective because of a &quot; significant trade &quot; in oil from an unnamed &quot; border country. &quot; That trade must be stopped , and stopped cold , before anyone seriously considers using military power against Haiti . As was proved in South_Africa , with patience and firm application economic sanctions can work against a pariah regime .</TEXT>
