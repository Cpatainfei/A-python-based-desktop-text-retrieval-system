   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; OUT OF STORAGE , INTO MODERNIST LIGHT ; NORTON SIMON MUSEUM UNCOVERS ITS TREASURED BUT LONG-HIDDEN SCHEYER COLLECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It gives local pride a nice glow to discover that the most important new exhibition of modern art in town has been here , unseen , for decades . The case_in_point is the Norton Simon Museum ' s presentation of &quot; The Spirit of Modernism : Galka Scheyer in the New World. &quot; The Scheyer collection is one of the revered treasure_troves of pioneer modernist art in these parts and would hold such status anywhere . It consists mainly of works by four masters : Paul Klee , Wassily Kandinsky , Alexei Jawlensky and Lionel Feininger . It was donated to the old Pasadena Museum in 1953 after the death of the impetuous , intense German collector and dealer . She moved to Los Angeles in 1928 to promote her passion for these Bauhaus artists and became part of the city ' s original tiny circle of modernist bohemians . * It included artists like Edward Weston and Stanton MacDonald Wright , architects like Frank Lloyd Wright , Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler , collectors like Walter Arensberg , Aline Barnsdall and bookseller Jake Zeitlin . The history reads like the story of trying to bring civilization to Eden . Scheyer ' s donation included numerous works by artists outside the core_group such_as Picasso , Nolde and El Lissitzky . It totals about 450 works . When the Pasadena showcase went upscale becoming the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art in 1969 , its curator , John Coplans , regarded the Scheyer collection as its greatest cultural asset . When the financially beleaguered institution was absorbed by Norton Simon in 1974 , local observers such_as then-Times art critic Henry J . Seldis wrung their hands_over the fate of the Scheyer collection . Actually , parts of it were kept regularly on view . Almost incredibly the museum never showcased it until now , possibly due_to the late collector ' s fondness for concentrating_on his own acquisitions . Even more surprisingly , Norton Simon chief curator Sara Campbell says she and her staff could find no records confirming that the highlights of the collection have never before been shown together . Maybe that ' s why it looks so fresh . There ' s a wonderful zest about the nearly 300 works lining the newly refurbished lower galleries that surround it . Everything is modest in scale , energized in impact . Jawlensky was Scheyer ' s special friend among the artists . He gave her the nickname Galka , which is Russian for blackbird . She posed for him frequently . Her heavy features appear in many of those female heads that were his semi-exclusive subject_matter . Initially they are loose and colorful , echoing Matisse and the_French Fauves . With time , their mood moves the clock simultaneously backward to the brooding Russian icon and forward to pure abstraction . In the ' 60s , Jawlensky was credited as a precursor of the theme-and-variation serial painting practiced by the Minimalists . His paintings are at once joyous and haunted . It ' s a curious combination of emotions also reflected in the troubled playfulness of Paul Klee . Limpid watercolor fantasies have wonderful titles like &quot; The Gate to Hades &quot; and &quot; Barbarian ' s Venus. &quot; They try to weld the wonder of a child ' s vision to the wisdom of a mathematical philosopher . They probably succeed so well because Klee was an accomplished musician . He also wrote one of the great poetic treatises on modern art , &quot; The Pedagogical Sketchbook. &quot; Klee ' s immensely smart sense of fun ripples over to Feininger . The only American of the Blue Four , Feininger invented the comic_strip &quot; The Kin-der-Kids. &quot; Some of the cartoonist ' s animated drawing style carried_over to his abstracted village-scapes and curiously melancholy images of boats . Kandinsky , the overarching inventor of non-objective painting is seen in a small early masterpiece , &quot; No . 151 A , Sketch for Deluge I &quot; of 1912 . More revealing are a set of images on the theme &quot; Small Worlds. &quot; These almost purely geometric abstractions are a triumph of talent over the often dead surfaces of lithography . They investigate the idea of inventing an imagery to match cosmological metaphysics . Hanging nearby is a similar set of so-called &quot; Prouns &quot; by Kandinsky ' s fellow Russian , El Lissitzky . Across the way there ' s a handsome double-framed geometric abstraction by Laszlo Maholy-Nagy &quot; AL 3. &quot; Taken together they are like early forays_into the idea of art as an act of perception , an idea realized here in the ' 70s in the work of our Light and Space artists . The compression and deft selection of this landmark exhibition makes its title entirely apt . The spirit of modernism was all drawn from the same well . It was a quest to distill feeling behind the merely visible . It was an act of immense idealism in a troubled world . It ' s the kind of show that reminds admirers of modernism what attracted them to it in the first place . It comes_with four handsome little monographs of the principal artists available boxed or separately . The exhibition has a good long_run until next fall . It would , however , be a very good idea to leave it up permanently . * Norton Simon Museum , 411 W . Colorado Blvd. , through Sept . 10 , closed Monday through Wednesday ( and Thanksgiving_Day ) . ( 818 ) 449-6840 .</TEXT>
