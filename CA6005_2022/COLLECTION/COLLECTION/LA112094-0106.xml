   <HEADLINE> THE PROUD BIRD ; THE BRONZE_AGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I read somewhere that the last flock of American Bronze turkeys was kept by the poultry science department at Oregon State University . It turns_out that that isn ' t quite true , certainly not in the sense implied by the story -- that when the flock was gone , so too would be the bird upon which Thanksgiving had been built . And it turns_out that it isn ' t quite true that OSU had the last American Bronze flock because what with budget_cuts and all , the school sold the flock : 25 hens and 10 toms . The turkeys they now keep have unique genetic weaknesses , such_as inherited disorders or distinct plumage . &quot; If you want to see the American Bronze , &quot; I was told by the OSU turkey specialist , Dr. Savage , whose name is Tom , &quot; get_in_touch with the Wishards in Prairie City . They have been raising them for 45 years . And one other thing . . . no , two . . . . &quot; The turkey is a very personable and intelligent bird , much more so than the chicken , say , or the Japanese quail . And it does not drown itself looking_up into rain. &quot; * Prairie City , a small farming and lumber mill town east of John Day in east-central Oregon , is the home of Wish Poultry and the Wishard Family who keep the last great flock of American Bronze turkeys to be found in the nation . The American Bronze is the bird that made Thanksgiving what it is today , and while it is far from endangered , its numbers have dwindled to a pathetic low in the face of the industrialization of the turkey as a meat-producing animal . In the passing of the American Bronze can be found the gradual erosion of a style of American farming , the loss of the barnyard and the rise of the meat factory . If Thanksgiving has a flavor , we are no doubt losing that as well . I called ahead before driving over . Marc Wishard described a narrow window of convenience through which he might be able to meet a writer interested in turkeys . The chicken slaughter was_on one side , the opening of elk hunting_season on the other . I arrived in between on a clear , warm Thursday morning . The Wishard place can be found behind the Prairie City High_School gymnasium : a small house , a tangle of outbuildings , penned-in pigs , the big holding pen where the turkeys are brought_in from the range for slaughter and where the breeding flock over winters . The sign at the entry read : Hard Eye Ball Information For Your Reaction No Drugs Used Natural , Organic , Real Safe , Fresh Fertile Eggs , Golden Fryers , Bronze Turkeys and Convenient Items Nothing To Harm The Body Guilty of Innocense ( SIC ) Grow Your Own Nonchemical Poultry Honest Show_Biz &quot; Hoo Boy &quot; Hang_in There No T.V. 60 Minute Birds , sorry &quot; Hardly any more Bronzes growed , &quot; Mark Wishard said , fixing me with a baleful stare across the small kitchen_table . His father had started the turkey farm 45 years before . Mark , who looked_to be in his early , road-weary 40s , had been a long-distance truck_driver for 15 years and had come_home to help his younger brother , Bard , with the business after the accidental death of their father four years before . * &quot; That power_line hadn ' t fallen on him , he ' d still be running the place and you ' d be talkin ' to him , not me , &quot; Mark said . &quot; We used to grow 30 # 000 turkeys a year . All natural . All naturally bred . Now we raise 2 # 500 and even that will drop now that the mill closed. &quot; So_much of our national Thanksgiving meal identity comes_to us from across the century , the grandmothers in their aprons lifting the roast turkeys from coal-burning ovens in family farm kitchens . Those birds grew_up in much the same way as the American Bronze turkeys raised by Wish Poultry , and presumably tasted the same . Before poultry grower co-ops were organized , farmers arranged their own markets , delivering carefully plucked birds with heads and viscera intact . During the Depression when co-operative marketing organizations took_hold , turkey-killing crews , odd men at best , traveled from farm to farm and slaughtered the birds and ruffed the feathers , plucking the larger body and wing feathers that are favored by arrow makers to this day . A crew of women would then come_in and pin , or finish plucking the carcass for the growers . * The birds were not eviscerated , but were cooled_down and delivered to a shipping station where they were graded , weighed and packed for shipping . Such was the &quot; New York dressed &quot; turkey . Evisceration was a housewife chore , an intimacy with where food comes from lost on the modern cook . As the farm changes , as the bird changes , as our relationship to the turkey changes , so too must Thanksgiving change . The turkey the Pilgrims raised once they established their colony came_to them out of domestic Mexican stock , with roots in wild Mexican stock . Of the wild turkey , there are five major varieties , the range of one of which extended at the time of the Pilgrims into New England . The Pilgrims brought over turkeys from England such_as the Norfolk Black , a variety that still exists , and crossed them with wild turkeys . As domestication of the bird increased in what would become the United States , the bird moved west with the population . Mrs . Marcus Whitman reported seeing turkeys at Fort Walla Walla on Sept . 1 , 1836 . They must almost have been big enough to slaughter . * By 1846 , turkeys were being successfully raised on the West Coast . They would have been tall birds , at least three feet from turkey feet to drooping dewbill , that odd , wiggly , fleshy protuberance that hangs down one side or the other of the turkey ' s beak . They would have seemed black from afar , but on closer inspection a remarkably wide variety of coloring would have become apparent in their feathering : strokes of white , layers of buff , brown , and metallic bronze , blue-black , even rouge . The Standard Bronze was recognized as a unique variety in 1870 by the American Standard of Perfection , the poultry equivalent of a pedigree , and became the common turkey throughout the country for any meaningful kind of meat production . It is the turkey most school children imagine each Thanksgiving , the one they draw_in silhouette by tracing around their outspread fingers on black construction_paper to represent the male turkey , the tom , hunkered_down to puff_out his chest and fan his tail feathers and turn his wattle scarlet red . In 1928 , a Whatcom County extension_agent in Washington state happened to visit the Jesse Throessel farm across the border in British_Columbia where he encountered toms that weighed 48 pounds and hens that weighed 25 pounds , or just about twice as much as they should . Throessel told the extension_agent that his basic breeding stock had come from his brother in England , where the flock had been selectively bred for more_than 50 years . The remarkable size had come from an early cross between the_English Cambridge strain and the Standard American Bronze , and the subsequent strain had become known as John_Bull . The Throessel strain was imported the next year into Whatcom County by a Lynden , Wash. , farmer , who successfully crossed toms with his own flock , achieving a much larger bird within the same 26- to 28-week growth span . * Two farmers in particular , one in Yakima County and one in Lewis County in Washington state , began working with the new strain in the early 1930s . One of them , Arthur N . Hamilton , took the new bird to the World Poultry Congress held_in Cleveland , Ohio , in 1939 . The Broad Breasted Bronze stunned the poultry world . As breeding stock became available and spread , first through the Pacific states , then across the nation , the Broad Breasted Bronze displaced the Standard Bronze as the American turkey of commercial choice . The Broad Breasted Bronze didn ' t last all that long . Within 20 years , it was displaced by its white-feathered equivalent , a preference of the turkey processors . White feathering is a recessive characteristic and , according to Harper , &quot; it only takes two generations to put white_feathers on a bronze bird. &quot; The reasons for the selection were and remain purely cosmetic . White pin feathers aren ' t all that visible on a turkey in a display_case . The dark pin feathers of the American Bronze , at times visible , encourage a certain squeamishness on the part of the ill-informed consumer . When the American Bronze is processed on the young side , areas of dark pigment beneath the skin can look_like bruising . Spokesmen for the commercial turkey industry explain the switch to the white-feathered bird as meeting the demand of the consumer . When Mark Wishard speaks_of his turkeys as all-natural , he means in part that his turkeys actually mate with one another , which is about as old-fashioned as the turkey business can get . At Thanksgiving , Mark and Bard select 155 egg-laying hens and 25 toms from the flock , and hold them over through spring to generate enough fertile eggs to produce the 2 # 500 turkeys the Wishards raise in a year . Any turkey not selected in fall_for breeding is dead and processed by Christmas . &quot; We only grow what we can kill and process ourselves , &quot; Wishard said . * The Wishards used to raise 30 # 000 turkeys at a time , but within the last 10 years it has become impractical to truck their birds to the processing plant in Salem . &quot; Used to be there were all sorts of little processing plants scattered around , &quot; Wishard said , &quot; but they have been closed_down and forced_out . Then the trucking_company went_out . And we were taking our birds over there and they were just getting mixed in with the rest at the co-op . And these days these are special birds . The allergy people just love ' em ' cause there ' s nothing in them that isn ' t natural. ' That isn ' t to say the turkeys raised by Wish Poultry are organic . While the Wishards mix all their own feed , the grain isn ' t necessarily organically grown . But the way the birds achieve maturity is about as natural as turkeys can get this side of wild . When turkeys are labeled in the market as &quot; all-natural &quot; all that means is that no preservatives and no food_coloring have been added . Otherwise the manufacturer has to list the ingredients , a list well worth examining on pre-basted turkeys . At 10 weeks , the turkey poults the Wishards hatch are moved_out of a wire-floored turkey house ( probably the last of its kind on any commercial turkey farm in the nation ) ( ck w / mh ) and introduced to the 250 fenced acres of range land outside of town that will be their home until fall . Throughout the 28-week growth cycle , the Wishards move the water station and feeding troughs around , and the turkeys follow after , pecking the native grasses right back to dirt , snatching at unwary insects , digging in their manure with their big turkey toes . * After leading me through the turkey house , showing me the incubator , explaining the stages of the slaughter on the small , efficient processing line , Wishard drove me out_to the range land to see the birds . A sign posted at the gate read : &quot; NOTICE , DOGS ON THIS PROPERTY SUBJECT TO DISPOSAL. &quot; The rifle in the rack in the truck and the spotlight on the floorboards were not for poaching deer . They were for trouble . &quot; We lost 100 birds in one night a while back , &quot; Wishard said . &quot; Some dogs got_in there between the time I checked the birds at night and came_back early in the morning . It ' s like throwing good money down on the ground , that happens . A coyote ' ll come_in every once in a while and kill a bird , but he ' ll only take the one , you know , to eat . I figure we all got_to live . Dog ' s are different. &quot; From afar , the turkeys looked_like a mass of black-robed morticians hulking about . But as we drove into the range area and they spotted us , the turkeys moved_in our direction en masse , pacing in our direction on long legs like the ballerina ostriches in &quot; Fantasia , &quot; their childlike curiosity completely getting the better of them . As they came_near , the sun picked_up and highlighted their extraordinary feather colors and the remarkable range of color_in their old , bald , grandmother heads , the vibrant purples and blues and reds sliding into scarlet . The turkey can apparently change this head color_in much the same way as a chameleon . These birds were all big , quickly reaching the optimum 13 to 15 pounds for hens and 22 to 24 pounds for toms . Beyond that weight , all_the Wishards would really be doing is feeding the birds grain they would n ' t convert into meat . And in turkey farmer terms , that is a waste . &quot; As it is , &quot; Wishard said , &quot; we feed our birds about twice as long as the commercial tom that ' s going_to weigh more by 17 weeks . It takes about 100 pounds of feed per turkey to grow it out. &quot; * I looked_out the rear_window of the truck and a small sea of excited turkeys loped along behind . &quot; We have the best flavored turkey in the world , right here , &quot; Wishard told me in an absolutely matter_of_fact tone_of_voice . &quot; that ' s my opinion. &quot; He may be right , but you have to go_to Prairie City , Ore. , to get the turkey to find_out for yourself . The truck slowed and we were soon surrounded by more_than 2 # 000 curious birds , all_of them standing at least three feet high . Never before had I been the focus of so_much pure attention , if not outright adulation . They made me feel_like the Mahdi returned . And when I stepped among them , slamming the truck door and startling the flock , their constant bubbly gobble exploded into high , piercing trilling , a sound like a space ship lifting off . I felt_like raising my arms and making a speech . But the only message I could have given the birds gathered around me was the obvious one , that their days were decidedly numbered . * Wish Poultry turkeys are not available outside of Oregon at this time . The company has no distributor and cannot ship their product . &quot; We ' re 100 miles from an airport , &quot; a spokeswoman with the company explained .</TEXT>
