   <HEADLINE> FEDERAL RULES PROPOSED TO REDUCE FAT IN SCHOOL MEALS ; NUTRITION : CONTENT IN LUNCHES COULD NOT EXCEED 30 % . AMBITIOUS PLAN WOULD NOT PAY ANY INCREASED COSTS , AND SOME CRITICS SAY IT FALLS_SHORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Public_schools across the country would be required to prepare meals containing no more_than 30 % fat -- and 10 % saturated fat -- under an ambitious federal nutrition initiative , but the government does not intend to reimburse them for additional costs . The proposed rules , to be unveiled today , will affect the food served to about 25 million schoolchildren every day and represent the most extensive change since the inception of the school lunch program almost 50 years ago . Instead of banning certain foods , schools will be required to analyze the menus they serve each week to ensure that they do not exceed federal limits for fat and saturated fat . Higher-fat meals may be served one day , for example , if lower-fat meals are served the next . While some school officials are likely to balk at the new responsibilities and added costs , schools that fail to comply with the rules would no longer be eligible for federal subsidies . After the regulations are published today , the public will have 90 days to register comments for consideration by Department_of_Agriculture officials . Unless they are rescinded , the rules will take full effect in four years . The Department_of_Agriculture contends that it should not cost more to serve meals that satisfy the new guidelines , but some food preparation specialists have expressed doubts . &quot; There could be cost problems , &quot; said Kevin Dando , manager of government affairs for the American School Food Service Assn. , which represents 65 # 000 members . &quot; Schools could be asked to analyze meals using computers they don ' t have. &quot; A Department_of_Agriculture report released last fall showed that meals served at 99 % of participating schools violated the proposed nutrition guidelines , with an average of 38 % of calories coming from fat and 15 % from saturated fat . It also showed that average sodium content was almost twice the recommended level . The new school lunch standards , a priority of Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy , are compatible with pending legislation sponsored by by Sen . Patrick J . Leahy ( D-Vt. ) , a key proponent of federal nutrition programs . &quot; It ' s about time the federal_government realized the indisputable link between nutrition , health and learning , &quot; Leahy said . In 1989 , Congress directed the secretary_of_agriculture to ensure that school lunches comply with federal nutrition guidelines . The proposed rules represent the first effort to comply with the mandate . Public health advocates praised the new regulations for limiting fat and saturated fat , which have been shown to be major contributors to obesity , heart_disease and cancer . But some criticized the initiative for not going_far enough . &quot; It is disappointing . . . that USDA did not propose lower sodium levels , &quot; said Michael Jacobson , executive_director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest . &quot; A diet high in sodium clearly contributes to heart_disease and stroke -- two of our nation ' s leading killers. &quot; The rules urge schools to decrease the sodium content of the food they serve but do not specify the actual amount . Nutrition advocates complained that the rules do nothing to regulate the fat content of food offered on an a_la_carte basis or sold from vending_machines at many schools . They also criticized the lengthy phase-in period . Dairy producers expressed concern that the new requirements could be used to justify an attack on whole_milk , which currently must be offered as an optional beverage with school lunches . Milk served with school lunches accounts_for about 5 % of all milk consumed in America . &quot; We think the natural tendency will be to take the easy way_out and not offer whole_milk , &quot; a dairy industry spokesman said .</TEXT>
