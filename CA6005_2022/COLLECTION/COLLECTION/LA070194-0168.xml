   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; EU FILM , TV LEADERS MEET TO TRY TO SAVE THE INDUSTRY ; TRADE : THEY GATHER TO DISCUSS RESTRUCTURING THE BELEAGUERED BUSINESS IN THE FACE OF HOLLYWOOD ' S ENCROACHMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a mood of apprehension and uncertainty , 300 leading figures from Western Europe ' s entertainment_industry convened here Thursday to confront a problem that won ' t go_away : Hollywood . They came_to the three-day European Audio Visual Conference to search for ways to revive and reshape the region ' s beleaguered film and television business , after being battered for years by the growing strength of their American counterparts . Delegates are expected to work from a series of proposals from EU Cultural Affairs Commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro for restructuring the industry . They will also discuss possible changes in a controversial 5-year-old EU directive governing television programming content in the region . Although the issue is not new , a sense of urgency has gripped Europeans that unless they invoke changes now , the entire industry could be doomed . In Hollywood , which derives roughly half its overall box_office revenue from foreign markets , executives are battling to maintain their foothold . Representatives from the Motion_Picture Assn . of America and the American Film Marketing Assn . have argued against protectionism in a series of meetings with their European counterparts . But the combination of the recent world trade agreement , which has severely weakened protections everywhere , and the implications of new technologies and a &quot; global information society &quot; have convinced many Europeans that they must go_on the offensive or give_up . A recent report on the status of the industry commissioned by the EU , known as the Think_Tank Report , sketches out the decline . In cryptic fashion it notes : * In 10 years , European films have lost 50 % of the theater movie market . * In 15 years , European films have largely become money losers . * American films are the only ones that play well throughout Europe . * The explosion of video has intensified American domination . * The liberalization of television in Europe has increased the dependence of the stations on American productions . A separate report issued by EU Executive Commission President Jacques Delors in December notes that American movies are mainly responsible_for Western Europe ' s brisk 6 % annual growth_rate in the audiovisual sector , with revenue from U.S. films rising from $ 330 million in 1984 to $ 3.6 billion in 1992 . &quot; Our fundamental political option is either to . . . create efficient industries that match our ambitions or to give_up and take the economic and cultural consequences that lack of action would entail , &quot; said Pinheiro , who is the host of the conference . &quot; . . . Implementation of a European policy for the program industry is therefore most urgent . We must act now. &quot; Last fall ' s bruising General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks and stubborn economic troubles in Europe have also brought an important new dimension to the meetings -- the voice of a pragmatic constituency that has come_to view Europe ' s film_industry not solely as a cultural treasure , but also as a commercial industry that needs to be made more competitive . This view first came_to_light in March , when another senior EU cultural affairs official , Colette Flesch , told a group of film_industry officials that &quot; Americans have taught us that motion_pictures are an industry and exports are crucial . . . . &quot; In this respect , there appeared to be a broadening awareness that in_order to survive , European directors and producers need to become more responsive to market demands and needs and that Europe ' s film_industry can no longer afford to subsidize productions that never reach an audience . &quot; We have to make more mainstream pictures , &quot; said Andres Vicente Gomez , president of Spain ' s Ibero Americana Film Produccion . At the same time , however , Gomez and others gave no impression they want to cut either the $ 500 million in subsidies doled_out annually to European filmmakers or to phase_out a controversial quota system that requires that at least half of television transmission_time in EU countries be devoted to European works . Indeed , the EU ' s discussion document for the industry ' s future calls_for a series of subsidies and other supports to assist a major restructuring , and the producers group Eurocinema recently proposed a five-year , $ 1.8-billion injection of government money to support the industry . The influential Think_Tank Report also warns , &quot; The quota would be wasted entirely if it simply allowed broadcasters to show American drama during prime_time and to dump European material into the more marginal segments of the schedule. &quot; During the three-day conference , the industry leaders are also expected to review ways to improve Europe ' s inefficient film distribution system and break_down intra-European cultural barriers that keep films made in one member country from showing in another .</TEXT>
