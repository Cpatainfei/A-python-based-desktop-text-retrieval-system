   <HEADLINE> NOT ALL DOCTORS ARE CREATED EQUAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the feature &quot; It ' s a Control Thing &quot; ( Aug . 30 ) contains some valuable information about talking to your doctor , the descriptions of different kinds of doctors are incorrect . A doctor_of_osteopathy ( D.O. ) is a fully licensed physician who prescribes drugs , performs surgery and has the same privileges and responsibilities as a medical doctor ( M.D. ) .Osteopathic schools have curricula similar to medical_schools but with more emphasis on the musculo-skeletal system and spinal manipulation . A chiropractic doctor , on the other hand , receives less training and consequently has a more limited license involving physical manipulation and adjustment of the spine . Most states do not allow chiropractors to prescribe drugs or perform surgery . An allopath is not an alternative practitioner . Allopathy , in fact , is a broad term that means conventional medicine . A naturopath , however , is an alternative practitioner who believes disease is caused by the accumulation of toxins and waste_products in the body . Naturopaths are not licensed in California . Finally , the headline of the article is disturbing because it implies that doctors don ' t want their patients to ask questions . Not true ! Good medicine is based on mutual trust where both the doctor and the patient feel free to communicate about very personal matters . When this communication fails , the patient and the doctor both lose . ROBERT M . KARNS , M.D. president , Los Angeles County Medical Assn .</TEXT>
