   <TEXT> For some viewers , &quot; Lit from Within : Amish Quilts of Lancaster County , &quot; at the Laguna Art Museum , may just be another exhibition , and a pleasing one at that . And , it is possible to view the stately , unoriginal approach of &quot; The Essential Gesture , &quot; a sculpture exhibition at the Newport Harbor Art Museum , as a useful lesson in art history . And perhaps it really isn ' t all that unusual that the essay accompanying &quot; Treading_on Hallowed Ground &quot; -- a recent show at Chapman University ' s Guggenheim Gallery that included art satirizing contemporary religious values -- had a preface stating the exhibition was not about &quot; the desecration of the sacred. &quot; But now that we ' ve weathered Election_Day , it can ' t be denied that the winds of conservativism -- which never stopped whistling over Orange County -- are now blowing in gale force . Since the art world is part of the real_world , it constantly is affected by political and social issues . These days , conservative empowerment has become most visible on the level of threats to National Endowment for the Arts funding , but its ramifications also quietly affect other aspects of programming . In an era of reduced arts funding and increased attention by politicians and special_interest groups to outspoken forms of art , institutions often find it prudent to keep a lower profile . Why rock the boat by presenting work that only a minority of viewers may enjoy or understand ? And if you show art likely to raise hackles , why not seek to minimize potential complaints ? Ironically , the quilt show occupies the Laguna time_slot formerly allotted to the long-awaited , first-ever retrospective of John McLaughlin ' s abstract paintings . ( Due_to the replacement of original curator Charles Desmarais , the museum ' s ousted director , that exhibition will not be shown in Laguna Beach until 1996. ) Walls that were to have been hung with the severe , contemplative geometric abstractions of the Southern California master now are filled with austere designs in fabric , passed down by generations of Amish women . Both bodies_of_work are visually and culturally interesting in their own_right . But &quot; Lit From Within &quot; is a fascinating example of how presentation and timing turn a seemingly apolitical exhibition into one that carries conservative social messages . * Back in the ' 70s , the impetus for showing the quilts in art_galleries was the similarity between Color Field painting , then in its heyday , and Amish traditional patterns . Nowadays , there are few kinships between quilt design and the contemporary art scene . Now , the selling point is that the quilts are products of a society that values ( as one gallery label puts it ) &quot; hard work , discipline and craft. &quot; Now , that ' s a message even Jesse Helms would love . To be sure , the quilts bear no images or messages , and the Amish themselves are historically apolitical . But the culture that created the quilts is about as removed as possible from the urban reality of welfare , sexual freedom , Godless youth and all those other vexing signs of unruliness that harden the conservative ' s heart . Photo blowups of smiling Amish girls , buggies in the snow and a large , modestly dressed family walking down a rain-splashed country road have the flavor of a chamber_of_commerce advertisement for jaded city dwellers : Come_to where the innocence is . Although the quilts in the show date_from 1890 to 1940 , their virtually unchanging appearance testifies to the tradition-bound society that made them -- just the opposite of the contemporary art world , where innovation is paramount and every form of weirdness finds its champion . No wonder catalogue essayist Robert Hughes , who famously disdains most progressive art of the past decade , waxes so lyrically over the quilts as &quot; emissaries from a vanished world. &quot; &quot; The Essential Gesture &quot; -- an exhibition incorporating various versions of the incomplete human figure that artists have used in sculpture during the past 40 years or so -- is a different type of response to the prevailing heads-down , don ' t-rock-the-boat climate . The show embodies an extraordinary timidity , an approach that is conservative because it risks absolutely nothing . Instead of giving viewers new ideas about body_parts in art -- by coming_up with unusual juxtapositions in the gallery and theoretical notions in the essay -- curator Bruce Guenther takes the safe , risk-free route with obvious groupings and standard explanations of art_movements and artists ' styles . Who is going_to complain about such an approach ? Surely not the museum ' s loyal patrons , who are delighted ( as some have told me ) to see work by the_likes_of Giacometti , Rodin and Peter Shelton in Newport Beach . Surely not students , who get a ready-made art history_lesson when they step_in the gallery . The complaints come mostly from art-world people who are_well acquainted with the artists in the show and had hoped for a new twist on the subject ( and also more up-to-the-minute work in non-traditional media ) . It used to be that Newport Harbor ' s self-curated shows were all about revealing the fruits of fresh scholarship ( about Abstract_Expressionism , say , or the trajectory of Chris Burden ' s career ) . These shows were first and foremost conversations in the national art community . that ' s what made them so exciting , so special . It was the museum education_department ' s job to explain the art to the general public . * Yes , it is good to see work by major artists in Newport . But by limiting the curatorial function to bringing_in blue_chip art -- a service local supporters easily can appreciate -- Guenther is leaving_out a vital part of an art museum ' s service to scholarship . Reconfirming viewers ' good taste is a reactive move , not an intellectual challenge . Certainly , the least worrisome phenomenon of creeping conservatism in our art museums and galleries is the &quot; warning sticker &quot; applied to potentially inflammatory shows . The Guggenheim Gallery continues to show bold work that makes no appeal_to majority taste . If a soothing remark in an essay keeps the closed-minded from wreaking havoc , bringing their children or flooding the phone_lines with inflammatory messages , so be it . These are perilous times for the renegade , idiosyncratic world of art , and those of us who value its freedoms must pay_attention to the strange ways it gets co-opted by the safe and sane . * &quot; Lit From Within : Amish Quilts of Lancaster County &quot; continues through Feb . 26 at the Laguna Art Museum , 307 Cliff Drive , Laguna Beach . ( 714 ) 494-8971 . &quot; The Essential Gesture &quot; continues through Dec . 31 at the Newport Harbor Art Museum , 850 San Clemente Drive , Newport Beach . ( 714 ) 759-1122 .</TEXT>
