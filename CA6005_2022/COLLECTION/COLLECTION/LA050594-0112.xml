   <HEADLINE> DANCE REVIEW ; ROYAL BALLET TURNS TO MADNESS OF ' MAYERLING ' ; THE BELOVED BRITISH COMPANY OPENS ITS WEEK AT THE ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER WITH KENNETH MACMILLAN ' S NARRATIVE FANTASY ABOUT A CRAZY , MIXED-UP ROYAL SADIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Royal Ballet could have opened its week at the Orange County Performing Arts Center_on Tuesday with &quot; The Sleeping Beauty. &quot; * The beloved British company has a lavish , brand-new production of the sweet fairy-tale classic in its repertory , staged by Anthony Dowell . Other American cities are seeing it on the current tour . But local impresarios fear Southern California has seen too_much of the pristine Princess Aurora . Ergo , in place of the dainty beauty , Dowell and his administrative associates brought us a nasty beast : Crown_Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary . Lilac Fairies are out . &quot; Mayerling &quot; is in . Remember &quot; Mayerling &quot; ? that ' s Kenneth MacMillan ' s convoluted , overpopulated , raunchy , athletic , picturesque , often effective , sometimes boring , quasi-historical narrative fantasy about a crazy , mixed-up syphilitic royal sadist who also happens to be a masochist , murderer , dope fiend , political schemer and heroic danseur-ignoble . Lilac Fairyland was never like this . Los Angeles hosted the American premiere of &quot; Mayerling &quot; back in 1978 at Shrine Auditorium ( remember Shrine Auditorium ? ) . Stephen Jefferies impressed as the glowering monarch-to-be whose partners included such disparate paragons as Lynn Seymour , Merle Park and Georgina Parkinson . We were struck at the time by the tawdriness of the concept , the brilliance of its execution , the long patches of silly busy-work that separate the bona-fide climaxes , and the flaccidity of a mock-romantic score pasted together by John Lanchbery ( he ' s got a little Liszt . . . ) . Still , we had to admire the shameless sweep and grandeur of the project . And we were awed by a series of pas de deux devised by MacMillan to define and differentiate the central relationships -- in turn lyric , dramatic , mechanical , casual , passionate , deranged and terminally violent . * The current &quot; Mayerling &quot; was first performed in London on the fateful night of Oct . 29 , 1992 . MacMillan collapsed and died backstage during the performance . In some ways , the revival serves as a fitting testimonial to a dauntlessly theatrical choreographer . Although he often valued bad grammar over good taste , he always did_it with flair . It is ironic to note , incidentally , that MacMillan was completing the dance interludes for the new &quot; Carousel &quot; at the time of his death . The disheartening result of that final labor can be seen these days at Lincoln Center . In the musical , expressive invention gives_way to stilted formality . MacMillan ' s stock pas de deux for Julie Jordan ( she ' s a queer one ) and her cavalier must have poor Agnes de Mille churning in her grave . There certainly is nothing so conventional or so vapid in the set_pieces of &quot; Mayerling. &quot; Here , even the apache-dance duets spring from the emotional crises , however hokey they may be . The Royal Ballet goes_through MacMillan ' s daunting rituals with bravura conviction . The company dances -- and poses and gestures -- as if lives were at stake . Forget everything you ever heard about stolid English reserve . In the case of Irek Mukhamedov -- who stalked the boards , fired the pistols , pressed the morphine syringe and twisted the assorted ballerinas as Rudolf -- English reserve was no issue . The man is a former divo of the Bolshoi . Understatement was never his thing . Still , he does bring a certain degree of repression to his movement vocabulary here , and it only heightens the tension . Wild-eyed and long limbed , Mukhamedov broods splendidly and explodes magnificently . He bears all physical burdens with forceful equanimity , and few challenges in the repertory can offer as_many burdens as this . If , ultimately , he cannot inspire much sympathy for the destructive prince , don ' t blame him . Blame Gillian Freeman , who wrote the bloody scenario . Blame MacMillan . Viviana Durante complements Mukhamedov most poignantly as the 17-year-old Mary Vetsera , an innocent obsessed with the ecstasy of destruction . She floats with fearless abandon through their torrid encounters , and crumbles with pathos worthy of her illustrious but far less fragile predecessor , Lynn Seymour . She also makes a stunning virtue of one MacMillan vice : the overuse of hyper-extended limbs to signal a soul in torment . Genesia Rosato , who had played a young flirt in the original cast , returned on this occasion to exude worldly eroticism and bitter frustration as the Countess Larisch . She did so , incidentally , as a replacement for Lesley Collier , the senior ballerina who suffered a torn calf muscle while dancing &quot; Sleeping_Beauty &quot; in Texas last week . The stellar supporting ensemble -- ensemble is definitely the right noun in this case -- included Nicola Tranah as the brittle Empress Elisabeth , Jane Burn as the sympathetic Princess Stephanie , Derek Rencher as the stuffy Emperor Franz Josef , Fiona Chadwick as the high-class whore , Mitzi Caspar , and Johnathan Howells as the blithely entertaining cab-driver , Bratfisch . The Royal Ballet still commands artistry in_depth . Nicholas Georgiadis ' literal decors remain attractive and reasonably supportive of the inherent dark moods . John B . Read ' s fluid lighting scheme reinforces the cinematic frame_of_reference . Barry Wordsworth served Liszt , Lanchbery and the dancers appreciatively in a pit exceptionally well-staffed by the Pacific Symphony . It wasn ' t the conductor ' s fault , of course , that the pastiche resists dramatic development and expansion , that the sudden appearance of a solo piano disrupts stylistic continuity , and that we never get_to hear a bona-fide &quot; Liebestraum. &quot; Nor can one blame him for the incongruous introduction of a mezzo-soprano to impersonate the emperor ' s &quot; friend &quot; Katherina Schratt ( a rather wobbly Beverley Mills ) . Her valedictory Lied may be pretty , but it jolts the senses . If these characters could really use their voices , they would n ' t resort_to all that silent emoting . And we would n ' t have a ballet . * The Royal Ballet performs different programs at the Orange County Performing Arts Center , 600 Town Center Drive , Costa Mesa , through Sunday . Tickets $ 20- $ 70 at the box_office , ( 714 ) 556-ARTS , ext . 240 .</TEXT>
