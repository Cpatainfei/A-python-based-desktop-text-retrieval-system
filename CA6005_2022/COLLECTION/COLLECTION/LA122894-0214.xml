   <TEXT> If you ' re still struggling to get your Christmas PC to work properly -- or if you ' re still waiting for your replacement Pentium chip to arrive in the mail -- you may_not believe this , but 1994 was a very good year in the computer world . Prices continued to fall as home users , once shunned in favor of business buyers , started buying PCs by the millions . The 66-megahertz 486 central_processing_unit -- considered the high-end chip_at the beginning of the year , is now the mainstream CPU . In the meantime , the Pentium , despite its well-publicized flaw , became a serious contender for both home and office use , with complete systems selling for as little as $ 1 # 500 by year-end . 486 systems could be found for as little as $ 800 -- about 20 % cheaper than a year ago . Even notebook PCs , which once carried a hefty premium , have dropped into the $ 1 # 000 to $ 1 # 200 range . 1994 was a good year for Apple as well : the company hit a home_run with its Power Macintosh line , which features the Power PC microprocessor co-developed by Apple , Motorola and IBM . The Power Macs , as promised , can run virtually all previous Macintosh software but they really shine when running programs designed for the machine ' s CPU . Programs written specifically for the Power Mac rolled_out a little slower than Apple had hoped , but there are now plenty to choose from , including the leading programs such_as Microsoft Word , Excel , WordPerfect and ClarisWorks . Apple ' s prices , while a bit higher than equivalent IBM compatibles , are no longer out_of_sight -- making them a viable option even for budget-minded consumers . Intel would have hit at least a triple with its Pentium systems had it not been for a foul_ball : The CPU can make division errors under some circumstances , forcing Intel to offer replacements for millions of flawed chips . Even without a replacement chip , Pentiums are still fine for typical home applications including word_processing , graphics , communications and home finances . CD-ROM_drives finally caught_on in 1994 , and they are now included in many new home systems . If you buy a CD-ROM_drive , make_sure it ' s at least double speed -- some newer CDs won ' t run_on slower drives . If it ' s for a young child , be sure you get one that doesn ' t require you to insert the disc into a special caddy before slipping it into the machine . As my 8-year-old discovered , opening a caddy can be tricky for people with little_hands . I have CD-ROM drives on my Mac and two IBM compatible PCs , and I ' m happy to report that the Mac was able to run every CD program I tested . I can ' t say the same for the PCs . A lot of the many Windows and MS-DOS discs I tested this year didn ' t run correctly -- at least not right out of the box . * I ' ve learned a_couple_of lessons here : Never install CD programs while kids are watching because they ' re too often disappointed when the program doesn ' t run correctly . And when you buy CD-ROMs , be sure the dealer agrees to take them back if they don ' t work . Don ' t accept a &quot; replacement disc &quot; guarantee . If a CD doesn ' t work , chances are that an identical replacement will have the same problem . Let ' s hope that 1995 will be the year that the software industry begins to clean_up its act in this regard . Imagine if we had these problems with VCRs , cameras and other devices . Computer companies are only beginning to understand the demands of real consumer products . 1994 was a great_year for children ' s software . My children , Katherine , 10 , and William , 8 , like &quot; Real_World Math : Adventures in Flight &quot; ( Windows and Mac ) from Sanctuary Woods , which teaches children about aviation while enhancing their math skills . They ' re also very fond of Davidson ' s Flying Colors ( Windows and Mac ) , a great painting program that lets them add a spectacular shimmering effect to their creations . Their favorite new program is Claris ' Amazing Animation ( Mac ) , which lets them create their own animated mini-features by clicking on a stamp and using the mouse to move it about the screen . Some programs introduced in 1994 have been a flop with my family . Microsoft ' s Creative Writer , ostensibly a writing tool for children , is_full of wacky sounds and zany cartoon characters . But it doesn ' t follow the Windows user_interface standards , comes_with very little documentation , and is hard to use for its intended purpose . Katherine tried to use the program for a school writing project but quickly became confused by all_the strange icons . I finally had to pull her away from the computer because the program was affecting her self-esteem . William , who ' s exceptionally good with software , couldn ' t figure it out either . For that matter , neither could I . Both of my kids find it easier to do their writing with Microsoft Word , WordPerfect or Microsoft Works . 1994 was a huge year for the on-line world . America Online says it tripled its membership to 1.25 million users , and CompuServe says it grew from 1.5 million to 2.5 million . Prodigy experienced modest growth during the year . ( Unlike TV , newspapers and magazines , there are no audit bureaus to verify the accuracy of company subscriber claims. ) * The Internet also grew like Topsy , though hard numbers here are equally hard to find . And Microsoft , which has long been criticized for allegedly trying to monopolize key segments of the computer_industry , announced its own on-line service , the Microsoft Network . It should get a big -- and some say unfair -- jump start by being bundled with Windows 95 , the new Microsoft operating system . And now Microsoft is going_after my business . The New York Times syndicate is going_to distribute a column by Bill Gates . Is no one safe ? * Computer_File welcomes your comments . Write to Lawrence J .
