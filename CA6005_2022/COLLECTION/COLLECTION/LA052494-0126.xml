   <HEADLINE> ON THE TRAIL OF A KILLER ; BLOOD_TEST DEVELOPED AT UCI MAY DETECT OVARIAN CANCER EARLIER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new blood_test for ovarian cancer developed at UC Irvine has become the focus of a national study to determine if eventually it could speed detection of the disease , which often kills its victims by growing undiscovered . With the approval of the National Cancer Institute , 140 women with ovarian cancer will be followed from their original diagnosis through two years of treatment , including surgery and chemotherapy , to see if the test can accurately detect changing levels of malignancy . Dr. Gale Granger , a UCI microbiologist who pioneered the basic research behind the new test , said that when it was tried_on stored blood from 53 ovarian cancer patients , it proved much more sensitive than the standard blood_test now used to monitor ovarian cancer . If the study shows the test can detect changes in malignancy in women known to have cancer , it is hoped it eventually could be used as a screening test for early detection of ovarian cancer . No such test exists now . Granger cautioned , however , that although the new test shows promise , this larger study of current patients -- not one that uses stored blood -- is needed to confirm the preliminary results . The nationwide study is being jointly conducted by UCI and Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center . The Gynecologic Oncology Group , a national research coalition of major medical_centers funded by the National Cancer Institute , will provide the cancer patients and their blood samples . Gynecologists have long been waiting for a diagnostic test for ovarian cancer that would be comparable_to a Pap_smear for cervical cancer , said Dr. Philip J . DiSaia , director of gynecology oncology at UCI , whose department has collaborated with Granger ' s researchers in developing the new assay . DiSaia said the standard test for ovarian cancer , which looks_for an antigen produced by cancer_cells called CA 125 in the bloodstream , has many shortcomings and is not sensitive enough to be used as a screening device . The test works by detecting the level of CA 125 ; a higher level means more malignancy . &quot; If a woman has a tumor the size of a hen ' s egg , there is only a 50 % chance of having a positive CA 125 test , &quot; he said . Moreover , he added , more_than half of the time when the CA 125 level drops to zero during therapy , exploratory surgery will still find active cancer . The new test works by detecting the level of a protein_molecule emitted by cancer_cells . Yet another problem with CA 125 is that it occurs in low levels when women have medical problems not related to cancer , such_as endometriosis and uterine fibroids . Dr. Otis Browley , program director in the National Cancer Institute ' s division of cancer prevention and control , agreed that a more accurate test for ovarian cancer would be welcome . &quot; If it has high sensitivity for cancer still in the ovary , it would be wonderful , &quot; he said , noting that ovarian cancer diagnosed at this stage can be cured more often than when it has spread to other body organs . Women whose cancers are detected in the earliest stage -- while confined to the ovaries -- have an 88 % chance of surviving five years after their diagnosis , according to the American Cancer Society . But ovarian cancer , which will kill about 13 # 600 American women in 1994 , usually shows no obvious symptoms until late in its development ; only 23 % of ovarian cancers are discovered early . Most often by the time the cancer is discovered , it has spread beyond the ovaries , when the chance of survival for five years after diagnosis plunges as low as 17 % . UCI officials say the new ovarian cancer test was developed after basic researchers at UCI teamed with gynecologists working_at UCI and Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center . For 20 years Granger ' s research group at UCI has studied protein_molecules called tumor necrosis factors , which the body ' s immune_system produces to kill cancers . Until five years ago , researchers were puzzled why these weapons didn ' t do their job very well . At that time , UCI scientists discovered that cancerous tumors secrete blocking agents that intercept and , in_effect , defuse cancer-killing TNF . These blocking agents mimic the receptors on the cancer_cells that the TNF uses as an entryway to the malignant cells . As a result , many of the TNF cells spend themselves attacking false targets . The researchers isolated these agents and developed a laboratory test to detect them in body_fluid . But it was a gynecologist fellow at UCI , who was working with the basic researchers , who had the idea that the microscopic blocking agents found in the fluid surrounding ovarian cancers could be used as a marker for ovarian cancer . &quot; I thought if we can pick it up in the fluid , maybe we can pick it up in the blood. &quot; said Dr. Elizabeth A . Grosen , who now is completing her specialty education at the City of Hope . To test her hypothesis , Grosen applied the new test to blood belonging_to ovarian cancer patients whom DiSaia had treated over the years at UCI Medical_Center and Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center . She found that the TNF blockers , called soluble TNF receptors , were elevated in the blood of women with diagnosed cancer and declined as cancer therapy progressed , mirroring the decline of CA 125 . An article on the research was published last year in Gynecologic Oncology . Most important , the TNF blockers continued to be detectable through blood testing after CA 125 had disappeared from the blood of patients who still had cancer even of microscopic size . These malignancies were found through biopsy or surgery . &quot; Based on the results of the testing they have done at UCI , it looks promising , &quot; said Dr. Edward Trimble , who gave the National Cancer Institute ' s approval to the expanded study . He said other medical_centers also are looking_for markers such_as antigens produced by cancer tumors that in combination with CA 125 might be more effective in detecting ovarian cancer . The blood samples collected by the Gynecologic Oncology Group will be tested at Memorial Cancer Institute of Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center . The test results then will be sent to the Gynecologic Oncology Group office in Philadelphia where they will be statistically analyzed . The gathering of blood samples for the new study began in March , Granger said . He emphasized that if the study determines that TNF blockers are a better measurement of cancer than CA 125 , a much larger future study will be needed to learn if this new test is accurate enough to be used as part of a routine examination to screen women for the first signs of ovarian cancer . Granger said there is also some evidence that TNF blockers may indicate the presence of other kinds of cancer . &quot; It is kind of opening a door , &quot; he said of the research under way . The Body ' s Battlefield How the body tries to fight ovarian cancer and how cancer fights_back . How cancer defends itself : When white_blood_cells releases TNF , cancer_cells responds by releasing countless imposters . TNF is neutralized if it latches_on to an imposter . Receptor : Vulnerable spot of cancer_cell where TNF can attach . Imposter : Phony receptors released by cancer_cell to fool TNF . TNF : Powerful , tumor-fighting protein released by white_blood_cell . White_blood_cell : Fights infections . How white_cell fights cancer : White_blood_cell releases TNF ; it searches ; for the real receptor . If TNF finds real receptor , it connects like a jigsaw_puzzle piece and begins killing the cancer_cell . Source : Dr. Gale Granger ; Researched by CAROLINE LEMKE / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
