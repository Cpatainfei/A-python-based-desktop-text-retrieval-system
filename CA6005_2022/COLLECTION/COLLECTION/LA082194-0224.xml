   <HEADLINE> WARSAW SHOWDOWN PITS POLICE AGAINST GANGSTERS ; EUROPE : OFFICIALS SEE THE FACEOFF IN HISTORIC OLD TOWN AS A HIGH-STAKES TEST OF POLAND ' S RESOLVE TO TURN_BACK ORGANIZED CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The circles beneath the eyes of Police_Chief Jerzy Stanczyk are dark and heavy , the battle wounds of a hellish few weeks . Stanczyk is struggling for control of Warsaw , his underworld adversaries taunting him like a caged animal . For more_than a month , a gang of thugs , many with lengthy criminal_records and alleged ties to organized crime , have terrorized restaurant and store owners in Old Town , the capital ' s historic center and the cobblestoned home to its most popular eateries and galleries . The gangsters , openly contemptuous of police , have demanded money -- in some cases thousands of dollars -- and reacted violently when turned_away . A French tourist was knocked to the floor and beaten when the owner of one restaurant balked , and several establishments were ransacked . Anonymous bomb threats have also been reported . &quot; There is a huge amount_of_money in Old Town , &quot; Stanczyk said from a desk cluttered with bleak crime reports and an overstuffed ashtray . &quot; This could be a spectacular effort to gain control of it. &quot; By choosing Old Town , the brazen gangsters have taken_on one of Poland ' s most enduring -- and successful -- commercial centers , a crowded tourist attraction dating to the 17th Century . There is perhaps no better illustration of Poland ' s determined recovery from World_War_II than the picturesque district , which was painstakingly reconstructed from a heap of rubble according to 200-year-old paintings and sketches . &quot; This case deals with the heart of Poland , &quot; said Andrzej Cubala , spokesman for the Ministry of Justice . &quot; These criminals acted in Old Town because they wanted to show everyone their strength and test the reaction of the police. &quot; Authorities say extortion schemes are increasingly common across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union , where criminal organizations have found ways to exploit the shift from communism to private enterprise . But until recently , Poland had been left mostly untouched . Gangs of criminals here dealt largely in smuggling electronic goods , narcotics , cigarettes and alcohol . The assault on Old Town is seen as the boldest in a series of brash moves by Polish gangsters to push beyond those traditional venues . Police in the port city of Gdansk have set_up a hot_line to accommodate the growing number of extortion victims there , while Poland ' s top law_enforcement official recently resigned in a scandal over alleged ties between criminals and police in Poznan , a large trade center in western Poland . The stepped-up criminal activity has frightened Poles and worried government officials , many of whom view the Old Town faceoff as a high-stakes test of Poland ' s resolve to turn_back the gangsters . Earlier this month , after receiving a letter from Old Town business owners , President Lech Walesa requested a special briefing on organized_crime from the interior minister . Meanwhile , the governor of the Warsaw-area province asked the army to deploy troops in the region . The FBI announced last month that it will open an office in Warsaw to help Polish authorities turn_back Russian criminal organizations , which are said to be eyeing operations in Poland . The new office will be shared with the Drug Enforcement Administration and special services of the U.S. Treasury_Department . &quot; I am really shocked , &quot; said Magdalena Palonek , a college_student visiting Old Town on vacation . &quot; I didn ' t expect this kind of crime could happen in Poland . You hear about it in other countries , but when our country began changing , I thought we would adopt the good things from other countries , not the bad. &quot; The crisis in Old Town has taken_on an even greater significance because of the woeful response of the Warsaw police . Restaurant owners in Old Town complain that it took weeks before police addressed their problems seriously , and then only after journalists chronicled the lackluster effort . Some owners have accused officers of cooperating with the extortionists , an allegation denied by police , while some government officials have suggested the gangsters were encouraged to move_into Old Town by a widespread perception of police incompetence . &quot; Because of the reputation of the police in the Communist times , police today are afraid of being accused of an abuse of power , &quot; said Jan Rutkiewicz , mayor of the central Warsaw district . &quot; So they would often rather not act than be charged with doing something wrong. &quot; Merchants became so frustrated with police inaction that they took the dramatic step of closing Old Town for three days at the height of the summer tourism season . Shortly after the protest was announced , police inundated the area with extra patrols , arrested a suspect and raided the offices of a security firm said to have links to the extortion ring . The police presence has been heavy ever since , with patrol officers questioning anyone they deem suspicious , but many merchants fear it still will not be enough . &quot; People are frightened . We are all afraid , &quot; said the owner of the Senator restaurant , which opened during the protest only to host a wedding_reception . &quot; If we don ' t react , Warsaw will be taken_over by the criminals. &quot; About 150 businesses participated in the boycott , which transformed the central Old Town Market_Square into a ghost_town and cost merchants tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue . On some streets , police patrols outnumbered pedestrians , but merchants said customers have since returned and have expressed support for the protest . &quot; This is very , very bad for the image of Poland , &quot; said Maria Bednarz , a hospital administrator from northern Poland vacationing in Warsaw . &quot; Something had to be done. &quot; Chief Stanczyk bristles_at the suggestion that his officers dragged their feet in Old Town , saying they were only following Polish laws , which in most instances require a formal complaint before an investigation is launched . Fearing reprisals , none of the restaurant owners filed such complaints , but the investigation began anyway following a storm of public outrage over the department ' s timidity . Stanczyk and other law_enforcement officials said Polish laws will have to be amended to reflect the country ' s changing criminal reality , particularly the increase in economic crimes , such_as extortion and fraud . Parliament is to review a proposed new criminal code , but reform efforts have failed in the past . Present laws do not allow prosecutors to offer immunity in exchange for testimony , and police are barred from staging sting operations . In addition , the country has no witness protection program . &quot; I want to live , &quot; one Old Town restaurant owner explained when asked why he kept quiet about the extortion attempts . Police in Warsaw have other problems too . Because of low salaries , reduced pension benefits and five years of political purges , the department has had difficulty attracting and keeping officers , who patrol an area of 2.5 million people . The force now stands at 7 # 100 officers , nearly 3 # 000 fewer than allocated for in the budget and half the number authorized by the former Communist regime . About 40 % of the force , moreover , has less than three years ' experience , with most of the new recruits coming from faraway rural_areas with high unemployment . Police_departments across Poland are operating with 25 % fewer officers than five years ago , and the federal Ministry of Justice , which has been highly critical of Warsaw ' s handling of the Old Town extortion attempts , established its organized crime unit only in June . &quot; Our numbers and abilities are no match for the threats of the criminal world , &quot; said Stanczyk , who is also new_to Warsaw , having moved here just six months ago from Szczecin , near the German border . &quot; We don ' t have the tools we need to fight this crime. &quot;</TEXT>
