   <HEADLINE> U.S. STRUGGLING TO RESTART TALKS FOR BALKAN PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As fighting continued Saturday around the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde , U.S. officials struggled to reignite stalled diplomatic efforts to end the conflict . In a telephone_conversation early Saturday morning , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher warned Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev that continued Serbian attacks on Gorazde would force the United Nations to respond militarily , U.S. officials said . Christopher urged Kozyrev to &quot; use whatever influence he had &quot; to defuse the conflict . Kozyrev later flew to Belgrade for emergency talks with Serbian officials in an effort to revive the stalled peace talks . Kozyrev ' s mission , one White_House official said , &quot; is intended to put pressure on them ( the Serbs ) to get_back to the negotiating table. &quot; Kozyrev ' s involvement would intensify Russian efforts to defuse the tense standoff between the Bosnian Serb forces and the U.N. peacekeepers in Gorazde . Russian special envoy Vitaly S . Churkin has been trying without success to mediate an end to the fighting . Serbian officials have looked_to Russia as an ally , and Russia has been cooler toward Western intervention in the fighting than the United States and Western European_nations . One White_House official said the Administration had received indications that &quot; some substantive progress &quot; was made Saturday in talks among Churkin , U.S. special envoy Charles Redman and representatives of the Bosnian Serbs , the United Nations and the Bosnian government . But the official provided no specifics . President Clinton met Saturday afternoon with his senior national security advisers to discuss the situation after another day of sharp military engagement around Gorazde that saw a British warplane shot down over the town . U.S. officials acknowledged that they remain uncertain about the motivation of the Bosnian Serb forces in pressing their attack against Gorazde ; indeed , one State_Department official said , it is unclear whether the Bosnian Serbs were trying to overrun the city or merely send a message of defiance to the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and the United Nations . &quot; It is not clear it is their intention &quot; to take the town , the official said . Appearing on Cable News Network ' s &quot; Newsmaker Saturday &quot; program , Rep . Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , agreed that the Bosnian Serb goals are unclear . &quot; The choices are ( either ) they are maneuvering for a tactical advantage just before the negotiations take full speed and go_on , or maybe they ' ve just decided that NATO and the United Nations are a paper tiger and they ' ve abandoned the idea of negotiations altogether. &quot; As the fighting around Gorazde has escalated , Clinton has struggled to dissuade the Bosnian Serbs of that notion -- without encouraging Bosnian Muslims to intensify their own bids to regain lost territory . On Friday , Clinton went_to unusual lengths in insisting that the NATO actions around Gorazde were not intended to place the alliance on the side of the Muslims in the bloody civil_war . NATO , Clinton declared , is &quot; not trying to change the military balance . We need to get the negotiations back on track. &quot; Hamilton said that getting the Serbian rebels back to the peace talks would likely require more forceful military_action than NATO has taken_to date . Meanwhile , a bipartisan group of foreign_policy experts and former officials called_for more aggressive military_actions to deter the Bosnian Serb offensive . In a telegram to Clinton , the Action Council for Peace in the Balkans said Clinton ' s declarations of neutrality &quot; have given a green_light for Serbian aggression and war_crimes to prevail and for genocide to continue. &quot; The telegram -- whose signatories include Zbigniew Brzezinski and Hodding Carter III from the Jimmy_Carter Administration as well as Jeane J . Kirkpatrick and Frank C . Carlucci from the Ronald Reagan_Administration -- called_on Clinton &quot; to issue a categorical warning to the Bosnian Serbs that they will be subject_to NATO air action unless the attacks on Gorazde and other besieged Bosnian areas are halted. &quot;</TEXT>
