   <HEADLINE> STUDY STRENGTHENS CANCER LINK TO SECONDHAND SMOKE ; HEALTH : EXPOSURE DURING BOTH CHILDHOOD AND ADULTHOOD POSES GREATEST RISK . TOBACCO_INDUSTRY DISPUTES FINDINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind , researchers in four states reported Tuesday that long-term exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke can increase the risk of lung_cancer in nonsmoking women by as much as 86 % , and that women exposed both during childhood and adulthood were particularly at risk . Experts said the five-year study , which appears in today ' s Journal of the American Medical Assn. , provides the best proof to date that secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of lung_cancer , and backs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ' s controversial 1993 decision to deem secondhand smoke a human carcinogen . The study found that , on average , a nonsmoking woman who has lived with a smoker at any time in her adult life faces a 30 % increased risk of lung_cancer . The research found a clear &quot; dose-response &quot; relationship , meaning the risk grew dramatically as exposure increased . &quot; This is a tremendously important paper , &quot; said Stanton Glantz , a UC San Francisco researcher who has done extensive work_on secondhand smoke . &quot; The scientific evidence that passive smoking causes lung_cancer is pretty ironclad . This makes the iron quite a lot thicker. &quot; The article comes at a time of intense debate over the dangers of secondhand smoke , also known as environmental tobacco smoke , or ETS . Nationwide , more_than 600 state and local ordinances restrict smoking . Congress is considering a bill that would ban smoking in nearly every public building in the country . The tobacco_industry is waging a campaign to persuade Americans that secondhand smoke is less harmful than most people believe , and contends that government efforts to regulate it are not supported by science . Today ' s JAMA article drew immediate criticism from the Tobacco Institute , the industry ' s chief lobbying group . The institute asserted that the study , &quot; like 12 of the other 13 ETS studies conducted in the United States , &quot; failed to show a statistically significant increase in risk . The group said the article &quot; confirms the insubstantial and uncertain nature &quot; of the dangers of secondhand smoke . The lead author of the article , epidemiologist Elizabeth T.H. Fontham of Louisiana State University , countered : &quot; The body of data available is not consistent with the Tobacco Institute ' s contention. &quot; After 40 years of denial that active smoking causes lung_cancer , Fontham said , she did not expect the tobacco_industry to acknowledge the risks of secondhand smoke . Fontham and her colleagues , including epidemiologists at USC and UC Berkeley , tracked women in Atlanta , Houston , New Orleans , Los Angeles and San Francisco . Their research , a continuation of their work that was cited in last year ' s EPA report , compared 653 nonsmoking women with lung_cancer to a control group of 1 # 253 randomly selected women . Unlike other secondhand smoke studies , which have focused primarily on women who were married to smokers and exposed in the home , the Fontham group also examined exposure in the workplace and social settings . The researchers used detailed questionnaires to determine when and where the women had been exposed , and for how many years . The investigators found that women who had been exposed to secondhand smoke only during childhood did not face an increased risk of lung_cancer . But women who were exposed during childhood and adulthood faced twice the risk of women exposed as adults only . The research also demonstrated that workplace exposure may pose a greater risk than exposure at_home . Women who had been exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace for more_than 30 years faced an 86 % greater risk of lung_cancer than women who had never been exposed at_work , the study found . Women exposed for up_to 15 years faced a 30 % increase in risk , and women exposed for 16 to 30 years faced a 40 % increase . In the home , women exposed to more_than 30 years of secondhand smoke faced a 23 % increase in risk over those never exposed . Glantz theorized that the reason for this is because smoking at_work occurs in closer quarters than at_home . But Fontham and her colleagues were unwilling to speculate on their results , and cautioned against interpreting the statistics to mean that exposure in the home is less risky . &quot; They are equally significant , &quot; said Anna Wu , a USC epidemiologist who participated in the study . &quot; This simply points_out that exposure , whether it is at_home or the workplace or in a social setting , if it is intense enough , it is going_to be bad for you. &quot; The group also addressed some specific criticisms leveled by the tobacco_industry against previous studies : that statistics have been culled from people who lied_about their smoking habits , and that other risk factors -- such_as a high-fat diet -- were responsible_for lung_cancer in nonsmokers . Fontham said the researchers excluded 2 % of the study participants after urine samples showed levels of cotinine -- a nicotine byproduct -- that were consistent with smoking . And , she said , the researchers adjusted their figures to account_for participants ' eating habits . Although the study looked only at women , the researchers said their findings hold for men as well . Most secondhand smoke studies have focused_on women because women are more likely to be the nonsmoking partner . The findings prompted the American Medical Assn . to call_for further restrictions on smoking in public places , and for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to regulate cigarettes as drugs because of the addictive nature of nicotine -- a move the FDA is considering . &quot; Cigarettes are no different than syringes , &quot; Dr. Randolph Smoak Jr. , a member of the AMA ' s board of trustees , told a Washington news_conference at a joint appearance with Fontham . &quot; They are a drug delivery device for nicotine . They should be regulated just as we regulate morphine and heroin. &quot;</TEXT>
