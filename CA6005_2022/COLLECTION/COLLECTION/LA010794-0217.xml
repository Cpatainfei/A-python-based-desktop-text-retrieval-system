   <TEXT> The first reference I can remember seeing to Irving Paul Lazar was in S . J . Perelman ' s Paris Review interview . Mr. Perelman , himself a notably stylish and fastidious traveler -- I believe he drove a Mercedes along the Silk_Road as far as Tashkent -- mentioned in passing that the only man he knew who could step off an airplane anywhere in the world with his hands in his pockets was Irving Lazar . I was a youth when I read that passage , and did not understand what a resonant tribute it was : a compliment paid by one great stylist to another . As a wordsmith S.J. Perelman was impeccable ; as a traveler , like most of us but unlike Irving , he tended to get frazzled . Irving Lazar ' s style , at_home or abroad , did not tolerate frazzlement . He stepped off the plane with his hands in his pockets -- excellently turned pockets , too -- minus such impediments as the suit bags , claim checks , diaper bags , crumpled tickets and lost composure that burden most mortals when they travel . A mere six weeks before Irving ' s death I dined with him at Chasen ' s . He was in a wheelchair then . When we returned home he wheeled himself around his house for a while , looking_for some object or other to give me ; while he wandered and considered , remembering the shop off Bond Street where he picked_up his bone_china , or the gallery in Nice where he secured the little Matisse , I happened to open a silver cigarette box given him by Walter and Carol Matthau . It was engraved with the following tribute : &quot; You have that rarest of things , an evolved heart. &quot; Well , so he did -- and he had an evolved style , too . But there is a Catch-22 to great styles : the higher you wind them , the tighter the catch . Our styles tend to make us ; then , if we last long enough and nothing beats them to it , they break us . Irving ' s devotion to fine European footwear rotted his feet and contributed its jot to his demise ; but , then , we are all going_to demise some way . Who ' s to say that too-tight English shoes shouldn ' t introduce the finale ? When I read the Perelman interview I had no suspicion that the man named Irving Lazar , who stepped off planes on the preferable continents with his hands in his pockets , would someday be my agent . At the time , and for many years afterward , I had an agent , Dorothea Oppenheimer , a wonderful if eccentric woman who got_through life on an intricate balance of beauty and bravura . Dorothea was born in a castle on the Danube and died in a one-room apartment on York Avenue , in New York City . In the three painful years that it took her to die , Irving , with uncustomary discretion , quietly did the work of agenting me . He treated Dorothea with the distinguished courtesy he bestowed on those who possessed what he called quality . Dorothea Oppenheimer had quality , even in the dusty apartment on York Avenue , and unto the hour of her death . Irving deferred to it , and behaved impeccably . A dying , impoverished European woman got the credit -- then minimal -- for selling &quot; Lonesome Dove. &quot; * A few years later , Irving ' s eye for quality instantly spotted this elusive element in the appearance and demeanor of a much younger_woman -- my goddaughter Sara Ossana , then 12 . Irving and Mary were in London , ensconced in their accustomed suite at Claridge ' s , a suite the King of Spain was allowed to use when Irving didn ' t happen to be in town . Sara and her mother , Diana Ossana , now my screenwriting partner , happened to pass_through on short notice ; on even shorter notice ( an hour , approximately ) , I called Irving and suggested dinner . The Lazars had planned to go_to a birthday_party for the King of Greece , a party to which numerous Windsors were coming , including the Queen and the glamorous young Princess of Wales . Irving instantly changed his plans . &quot; I see those people all_the time , &quot; he said , and an hour later Sara and Diana and I were dining with Irving and Mary in the grand ballroom of Claridge ' s . Irving spent the evening admiring Sara ' s haircut -- a world-class haircut she had given herself , only the day before -- and harassing the captain to rush yet more delicacies to Sara ' s plate . On the basis of an excellent haircut and a_few minutes conversation , Irving took Sara up and was unfailingly generous to her from then on . She was one of the few young_women of her generation allowed to bring her boyfriend to the Oscar party ; to the end , Sara loved Irving and Irving , Sara . T . S . Eliot once made a famous remark about Henry_James , who , Eliot said , had a mind so fine that no idea could penetrate it . Irving ' s mind was not unlike Henry_James ' . The texts that he agented rarely , if ever , penetrated it , except by osmosis . For years , once he became my agent , I waited for some chance statement that would indicate that he had read at least a page or two of the many books he agented for me ; the statement never came . Life , in the Scott Fitzgerald sense , was always glimmering out there somewhere : drinks , fine women , dancing , French food , exciting talk , and the endless parade of the great and famous , the beautiful and bold , were Irving ' s texts . Not for him the contemplative hour with Horace or Virgil ; despite which he was , in his bones , a literary man . He honored writers and never , to my knowledge , allowed himself to confuse the work of literature with the subliterary bestseller . He reaped millions off bestsellers -- in the way of the street -- but his first and fiercest loyalties were to those who attempted literature , and , Truman Capote excepted , he didn ' t expect to find them at Spago or Le Cirque . * As a man of the cafe and the boulevard , Irving lavished his energies on not a_few people who were spoiled well past the point of putrefaction ; he was sometimes careless when it came_to separating the wheat from the chaff . But manners -- what he called &quot; the correct thing &quot; -- mattered_to him to the end . If Irving really cared about you , as he cared , for example , for Dorothea and Sara , it was necessary that you do the correct thing . With Dorothea this meant dying with her courage intact . With Sara , it meant exacting discipline in the_matter of haircuts . When people abandoned their standards , and proved unable , in the difficult situation that life is sure to bring us , to do the correct thing , Irving ' s judgment was immediate , and , frequently , final . Lady Keith could tell you . In his year of bereavement , after Mary ' s death , Diana and Ossana and I saw Irving often . On our last visit , a_few weeks ago , he rose out of sedation and talked lucidly and lovingly , for almost an hour , about Bogart and Hemingway . He spoke about Bogart ' s death , and Hemingway ' s torment . But then he began to reminisce about their good times -- he ceased to talk_about them as if they were dead and spoke as he might speak_of people who were traveling , people whom he would probably see again , as it might be , when he was passing_through Paris , or lunching at &quot; 21. &quot; In humans the grace that lasts is probably always moral , and always tragic . Irving and Mary are gone , and the community of the arts is diminished . Irving was a larger-than-life figure in a town that , but for the great magnifying_glass of the screen , would be in most ways smaller than life . His intelligence and his taste brought an element of refinement to a culture in most ways crude . His taste reached back to the Europe of the great West Coast emigres : Mann , Stravinsky , Renoir . There are few links to that time left , and none who sustained the range of contact and reference that Irving Lazar commanded . With his passing , in the words of Thomas Nashe , the Renaissance poet , a brightness has fallen from the air . Irving himself , at his 85th birthday_party , lamented the devaluation of glamour , as he saw it , in a town where movie_stars seldom take the trouble to be movie_stars anymore . Once , speaking_of President Reagan , whose memoirs he didn ' t get_to agent , Irving consoled himself with this reflection : &quot; that ' s all_right -- pretty soon he ' ll be where Franco is. &quot; As it happened , Irving took ship first . The prince of agents , the man who could step ashore , or out of a plane , or off a train with his hands in his pockets , is traveling now . We can be sure that a car will be waiting , at the dock , or the airport , or the station . The best suite will be his , at the best hotel ; the clothes will have been unpacked ; the captain will be waiting deferentially at the best table in the best restaurant , where the best company will soon gather to dine and drink till eternity cracks . He won ' t be sitting with Franco , though . Irving will be traveling in that greatly peopled borne where Mr. Kafka dines with Mrs . Woolf , and Papa breaks_bread with Baudelaire . And should it be that either the Lord of Light or ( better yet ) the Prince_of_Darkness is ready to sell his memoirs , Irving Paul Lazar will get right on the phone .</TEXT>
