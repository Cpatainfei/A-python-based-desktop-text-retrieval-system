   <TEXT> Nearly 30 years ago , the United States issued a clarion call against the spread of communism in Asia , and Southeast Asian_nations eagerly united behind the U.S. initiative . But when Washington tried to pull_together similar support this year to isolate Myanmar , where human_rights violations are rife , the coalition balked . Thailand said that instead of isolation it would offer &quot; constructive engagement &quot; to the military regime in Myanmar , formerly known as Burma . Singapore Prime_Minister Goh Chok Tong paid a friendly state visit to Yangon , the capital . The six-member Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations even invited Myanmar to send the leader of its military junta to its annual meeting here this July . More and more , the economically booming nations of Asia are flexing their political muscle in_disputes with the United States and the West , especially on such sensitive issues as human_rights , freedom of expression and labor rights . Some call it the Asian Way ; others refer to neo-Confucianism or East Asian authoritarianism . A hybrid of traditional Asian culture and 1990s economics , this doctrine champions society over the individual and &quot; family values &quot; over what is seen as corroding Western influences . Most important , according to its ardent believers in China and the surrounding states of Southeast_Asia , economic development requires a period of political stability not possible under democracy -- a notion derided by Western critics as justification for tyranny . Whatever the name , the Asian Way doctrine is a distinctly post-Cold War phenomenon that may spell declining U.S. influence in the region and threatens to raise friction across the Pacific in years ahead . &quot; With the growth of their economic prosperity , East Asian_countries are becoming more assertive politically , &quot; said Washington SyCip , a prominent Manila business consultant . &quot; I think you ' ll see them being more and more forthright and stating what their values are. &quot; Bearing him out are statistics showing the combined gross_domestic_product of East Asia -- Japan , China , Hong Kong , Taiwan , South_Korea and the Southeast Asian_nations -- was 4 % of the world economy in 1960 ; by 2010 , it is expected to be 33 % . Samuel P . Huntington , a Harvard professor , speculated in an essay published last year that Asia and the United States were entering a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; that inevitably followed the clash of ideology that predominated in the Cold_War . &quot; A West at the peak of its power confronts non-Wests that increasingly have the desire , the will and the economic resources to shape the world in non-Western ways , &quot; Huntington wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine . Is the Asian Way really new ? After all , both Taiwan and South_Korea boomed economically under authoritarian regimes and have made the transition to democracies . But in the 1960s and 1970s , the United States was more willing to turn_a_blind_eye to human_rights abuses in the name of anti-Communist solidarity . Only since the Cold_War ended in 1988 has Washington seemed eager to confront Asian_countries with broader issues of democracy and labor rights . The most dramatic example of Asian muscle-flexing is the debate between Washington and the Communist rulers in Beijing over human_rights , culminating in President Clinton ' s decision , announced Thursday , to renew most-favored-nation trade status for China . The United States had linked continuation of the trade benefits with human_rights improvements , but Clinton was forced to make an embarrassing retreat . When Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher visited Beijing in March , Premier Li Peng warned him that China &quot; will never accept U.S. human_rights concepts. &quot; As Christopher expressed outrage at the detention of Chinese dissidents , Li responded by warning that if its trade status is revoked , &quot; the United States will suffer no less than China. &quot; China ' s economy is booming , with growth at 13.4 % last year , and European as well as U.S. businesses are scrambling to enter the market . Even though China runs a $ 23-billion surplus with the United States , meaning it would suffer much more from a trade drop , it was U.S. business interests that spoke gloomily about the potential loss of 200 # 000 jobs if MFN status were revoked -- enough to sway the President . While many Asian_countries remain wary of a resurgent China , the U.S. linkage of trade and human_rights did not find a sympathetic audience in the region . &quot; When China becomes powerful in 20 or 30 years ' time , there is no reason why China should behave kindly toward the West , &quot; Singapore ' s Goh said when asked about the possible effect of trade sanctions on Beijing . &quot; that ' s our worry : China may want to flex its muscles , and then it will be a very troublesome world. &quot; He added that Singapore will continue to invest in China no matter what the United States decides to do . Then-Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa undercut Washington during a recent visit to China by declaring , &quot; It is not sensible for Western countries to impose their values of democracy on other countries. &quot; Even Australia , normally a champion of human_rights but now courting Asia ' s business , has parted company with the United States in its dispute with China . Australia ' s ambassador to Washington , Don Russell , urged the Clinton_Administration in April to drop its aggressive pursuit of human_rights and adopt a low-key dialogue with China using &quot; constructive , non-confrontational engagement. &quot; Southeast Asian_nations are similarly assertive with the United States and Europe about Myanmar , because of budding economic ties and dislike of outside interference . No one disputes the country ' s appalling human_rights record , in which thousands of demonstrators have been killed and the military junta has rejected the results of a May , 1990 , election that was won in a landslide by the opposition National League for Democracy . The League ' s chairwoman , Aung Sang Suu Kyi , has been under house_arrest for nearly five years . Winston Lord , the assistant secretary_of_state for East Asian affairs , called_on Myanmar ' s neighbors to help isolate the country ' s generals until the human_rights picture improved . But last month , Lord was forced to concede that &quot; as friends , &quot; the United States and Southeast_Asia &quot; have agreed to disagree on the approaches. &quot; Singapore is the largest investor in Myanmar , followed by Thailand and Japan . But beyond economic questions , Southeast Asian_countries are loath to allow outside powers to interfere in what they consider to be the internal affairs of a neighboring state . &quot; If we were to adopt the Western approach with Burma , we would be abandoning our role , &quot; Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri said . &quot; We are neighbors , and we should keep_up relations in_order to bring them out into the world community. &quot; The other members of ASEAN -- Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei , Indonesia and the Philippines -- have agreed to follow the policy of &quot; constructive engagement &quot; toward Myanmar . One of the paradoxes of the recent assertion of the Asian Way is that no two Asian_nations are culturally identical . Corruption-free Singapore stands_in contrast to the venality of Indonesia and Thailand , and the media are as free in the Philippines and Thailand as they are controlled in Malaysia and Singapore . Critics , mostly in the West , argue that there really is no &quot; Asian Way. &quot; They say this is a convenient slogan seized by undemocratic rulers to justify their continued hold_on power . Indonesian President Suharto , who took power in the 1960s after a military coup , has presided over dramatic economic_growth in his crowded nation , the largest in Southeast_Asia . Suharto has argued that it is unrealistic for his country to use Western standards . &quot; We are people of the East , so we must use Eastern standards , &quot; he said in a speech in May . &quot; We cannot don Western clothes because they are too big . It would make us look_like scarecrows. &quot; One example of the &quot; Eastern standard &quot; : 21 Indonesian students were sent to prison for six months this month for slandering the president by holding_up banners outside Parliament . The sentences were considered light compared to another student who received four years in prison on the same charge in February . Indonesia ' s differences with the West over human_rights escalated after army troops killed about 200 demonstrators in the former Portuguese province of East Timor in November , 1991 . The Jakarta government announced that it would spurn further aid from European_countries rather than have human_rights strings attached . Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed has warned Asian states against becoming the &quot; slave of democracy. &quot; He asserted in a speech last year that too_much democracy leads to moral decay , homosexuality , widespread drug use and the collapse of the work ethic . When Australian Prime_Minister Paul Keating called Mahathir &quot; recalcitrant &quot; for not attending last year ' s transpacific talks in Seattle , Mahathir flexed his country ' s new economic muscle by hinting at trade sanctions against Australia . Keating hastily apologized . Former Singapore Prime_Minister Lee Kuan Yew , now a senior minister in the government and a political theorist whose views are much in_vogue in Asia these days , remarked recently : &quot; With few exceptions , democracy has not brought good government to new developing countries . Democracy has not led to development because the governments did not establish stability and discipline necessary for development. &quot; Vietnam , which like China is emerging from decades of orthodox Communist rule to embrace market capitalism , warned that despite the shifting economy , the country is not about to abandon communism for democracy or multi-party ideology . Vietnam is expected to be invited to join ASEAN soon . When Swedish Prime_Minister Carl Bildt visited Hanoi in April and waxed eloquent about free economies needing free societies , the government chopped the offending remarks from a translation of his speech . Vietnam ' s hard-line attitude was demonstrated in recent months when the government agreed to allow Western organizations , including the U.S.-based Freedom Forum , to conduct seminars on journalism , and then canceled the meetings at the last minute without explanation . Kishore Mahbubani , the top civil_servant in Singapore ' s Foreign Ministry , published an essay in the Washington Quarterly this year in which he blamed the United States ' current troubles on too_much freedom . &quot; In a major reversal of a pattern lasting centuries , many Western societies -- including the United States -- are doing some major things fundamentally wrong , while a growing number of East Asian societies are doing the same things right , &quot; Mahbubani said . A Stanford_University professor wryly observed that Singapore ' s recent caning of American teen-ager Michael Fay for vandalism made him the first known victim of the &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; expected to take_place between Asia and the United States . Clinton denounced the punishment as extreme , but many Asians -- and a fair number of Americans -- decried the United States ' crime_rate and said it needed to adopt more stringent punishments . &quot; If there is a single fundamental difference between the Western and Asian world_views , it is the dichotomy between individual freedom and collective welfare , &quot; a Singapore businessman , Ho Kwon Ping , told a meeting of lawyers this month . He said that while Western countries might prefer to see a guilty man go free than convict an innocent man , Asians would prefer &quot; an innocent person to be convicted if the common welfare is protected . And better for a guilty person to be free if conviction would inflict further harm on the community. &quot; Apart from the issue of human_rights , few things make Asian leaders bristle as much as the Western media . China , Malaysia and Singapore have banned individual ownership of satellite dishes to prevent direct reception of Western programming , which they view_as an assault on Asian values . Still , a dispute arose this month when the respected British Broadcasting Corp . withdrew its news_programs from Malaysia after government censors excised a filmed report about labor strife in neighboring Indonesia . The Singapore government has restricted the circulation of Western newspapers and magazines such_as Time and The Economist because officials dislike their coverage of Singapore affairs . Under pressure from China , media magnate Rupert Murdoch announced that the BBC World Television_program was being withdrawn from transmissions on the Hong Kong-based Star Television satellite service . It was replaced with Chinese-language movies . Earlier this year , Malaysia barred new business_deals between British firms and the government in retaliation for a series of exposes in London ' s Sunday Times alleging corruption in the Malaysian government ' s awarding of contracts . Murdoch , who owns the Sunday Times , subsequently moved the editor of the paper , Andrew Neil , to a job in the United States . &quot; He was the cause of the government ' s decision to ban new government contracts for British companies , &quot; Mahathir crowed after Neil ' s transfer was announced . Another issue on which Asia and the West seem likely to collide is labor rights . The United States and France have suggested that a worldwide minimum_wage be adopted by the World Trade Organization to stop the exploitation of workers in poor countries . Malaysia ' s Mahathir said the West ' s &quot; professed concern about workers ' welfare is motivated by self-interest , &quot; because , he said , low wages are the developing world ' s only competitive advantage against the industrialized West . &quot; Washington ' s new-found concern for workers ' rights is downright hypocritical , &quot; the Bangkok Post said in an editorial . Singapore ' s Lee even argued that the U.S. position was responsible_for labor unrest last month in Medan , Indonesia , in which one person was killed . &quot; Asians believe the intended beneficiaries ( of the U.S. pressure ) are not workers in Indonesia and Malaysia but American trade_unions belonging_to the AFL-CIO who fear losing jobs to low-wage countries , &quot; Lee said .</TEXT>
