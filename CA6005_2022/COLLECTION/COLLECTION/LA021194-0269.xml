   <HEADLINE> FEDERAL AGENCY WOULD SHIP SEA_LIONS TO COUNTY AGAIN ; ENVIRONMENT : FISHING OFFICIALS HERE DISLIKE THE PLAN , AIMED AT HELPING STEELHEAD TROUT STOCKS IN WASHINGTON STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As_many as 60 California_sea_lions that are devouring large_numbers of steelhead trout off Washington state would be relocated to waters off Ventura and Santa Barbara counties under a proposal to be considered next week by the California Coastal Commission . The proposal , which has been criticized by local fishing interests , marks the second time that the National Marine Fisheries Service has tried to relocate sea_lions to keep them from eating the already depressed stocks of steelhead at their spawning grounds near Ballard Locks , Wash . In 1989 , after the Fisheries Service relocated six sea_lions to local waters , five returned to Ballard -- a 1 # 500-mile journey -- within a month , according to James R . Raives , a Coastal Commission analyst . &quot; Apparently , as soon as they were released into the water , they headed north and high-tailed it back to Washington , &quot; Raives said , adding that sea_lions in Washington all migrated north from California waters in the first place . &quot; They apparently know a good meal when they see it. &quot; Joe Scordino , deputy chief of fisheries management for the Fisheries Service ' s northwest division , said the goal is not necessarily to relocate the sea_lions permanently , but to provide some relief for the spawning steelhead . &quot; Basically , what we are doing is buying some time for the steelhead to spawn without them being grabbed by the sea_lions , &quot; Scordino said . &quot; We do not harbor any beliefs that the animals we transport down there will stay there. &quot; Raives said the Coastal Commission staff will recommend that members approve the Fisheries Service proposal , but local fishing officials said it is a bad idea . &quot; The population of sea_lions here is already out of control , &quot; said Brian Jenison , spokesman for the Ventura County Commercial Fishermen ' s Assn . &quot; It ' s not right that one state ' s problems are being dumped on another. &quot; Jenison said the sea mammals often follow sport and commercial fishing vessels and effectively shut_down their operations , grabbing the catches directly from nets and lines . &quot; Once the sea_lions show_up , you have to leave or you ' ll be wasting your time , &quot; Jenison said , adding that the sea_lions especially enjoy sea_bass and halibut . &quot; You just hope that they won ' t follow you. &quot; Scordino said the Ballard Locks area is the first hurdle of a miles-long steelhead migratory path into the Lake Washington watershed off Puget Sound . Because the fish are slow to negotiate the locks ' fish_ladders , they become vulnerable to the constantly hungry sea_lions . In an attempt to protect the steelhead , Fisheries Service biologists have installed underwater devices that emit noise designed to repel the sea_lions , which works to some extent , Scordino said . &quot; The animals that we will eventually seek to relocate are those that penetrate the acoustical barrier around the locks , &quot; Scordino said . &quot; So far , that barrier has worked , but we would like to have the relocation option available to us should we need it. &quot; Once captured , the sea_lions will be trucked south from Washington to the Santa Barbara area in an estimated 22-hour ride , with stops along the way to feed and wet down the animals . Scordino said the mammals will be released into groups of sea_lions spotted in the Santa Barbara Channel or on one of the Channel Islands . In peak season , the channel is home to more_than 100 # 000 sea_lions , according to official estimates . If any of the newcomers remain in Southern California waters , the Coastal Commission ' s Raives said , it will be the larger , sexually mature specimens . &quot; What we noticed in 1989 was that all five of the sea_lions that returned to Washington were young or sub-adult in classification , &quot; Raives said . &quot; The one animal that stayed in the area was older and bigger and was able to integrate himself with the local populations of female sea lions. &quot; For Jan Mangus , 44 , a Santa Barbara-based sport fishing enthusiast , the addition of even a_few sea_lions means more headaches and less fun . &quot; I view sea lions the same way a farmer views gophers -- a real pest , &quot; she said . The proposal is_due to come_before the Coastal Commission during its meeting at 9 a.m. Thursday in San Diego .</TEXT>
