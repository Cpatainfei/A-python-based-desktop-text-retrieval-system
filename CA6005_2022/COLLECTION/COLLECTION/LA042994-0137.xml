   <HEADLINE> MCNALL BEING INVESTIGATED BY GRAND_JURY ; JURISPRUDENCE : KING OWNER ' S LOAN DOCUMENTS AT CENTER OF PROBE . SALE OF THE TEAM COULD BE IN DOUBT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> King owner Bruce McNall is being investigated by a federal grand_jury looking_into whether he falsified loan documents , a development that has thrown into doubt his plan to sell a majority interest in the hockey_team in a deal that was to have closed today . A spokesman for McNall confirmed to The Times on Thursday that an investigation had started . In a separate interview , Tom Pollack , a partner and criminal lawyer at Irell &amp; Manella who has been retained by McNall , said : &quot; An investigation is just an inquiry . Many such inquiries result in no government action . Mr. McNall believes that once the government completes its inquiry , no action will be taken. &quot; Pollack added that &quot; to the best of my knowledge , this investigation does not involve any alleged wrongdoing on the part of the Los Angeles Kings. &quot; Officials at the U.S. Attorney ' s Office in Los Angeles declined comment . Sources familiar_with the investigation told The Times that several key McNall employees received subpoenas last week at_home and at McNall ' s offices requesting that bank and other financial records be turned_over to a grand_jury . The sources said that individuals have not yet been subpoenaed to testify before a grand_jury . Sources said that the subpoenas were general in nature , and do not list specific loans . McNall ' s single largest lender is Bank of America , which is owed $ 92 million . Other banks that do business with McNall-affiliated companies include Bank of California and the_French bank Credit Lyonnais , according to court records and sources . Although the specifics of the investigation have not been made public , McNall has been accused of bank-related irregularities in court papers before . In a lawsuit filed_in February , Ira and Lawrence Goldberg , partners with McNall in Superior Stamp &amp; Coin in Beverly Hills , alleged he misused company money for other ventures . In a sworn statement , Ira Goldberg said that McNall &quot; falsified Superior ' s 1993 year-end inventory statement with the intent to mislead Superior ' s auditors and the Bank of California &quot; by listing as Superior inventory -- and therefore as collateral -- coins that Goldberg says really belonged_to a McNall-organized coin fund . The Goldbergs alleged in the now-sealed documents that McNall used $ 4.6 million from a bank credit_line . They also said McNall used Superior money because he &quot; desperately needed funds to maintain his other ventures and his extraordinary life style. &quot; A tentative settlement has been agreed to , but has not been made final . The investigation is the latest in a growing list of problems for McNall , who last June was relishing in the success of the Kings for making the Stanley Cup_finals and who has long enjoyed a reputation as having a golden touch when it comes_to making money in rare coins and other fields . McNall , 44 , is being sued in New York for $ 28.3 million for allegedly defaulting_on a loan to Dutch-owned European American Bank -- a debt he disputes even exists -- and also has agreed to pay Torrance-based Republic Bank $ 2.1 million after defaulting_on a loan . Other creditors suing McNall for payments allegedly owed include the owner of the building where his offices are located for back rent , movie studio Twentieth Century Fox for allegedly failing to pay_back money advanced on a film and a company that repaired a jet_engine for the Kings ' team plane . McNall also recently told Vanity_Fair magazine he once routinely broke foreign export laws in his transactions with overseas coin and artifacts dealers . McNall has been trying to sell 65 % of the Kings for $ 60 million to telecommunications executive Jeffrey P . Sudikoff and partner Joseph Cohen as part of a larger effort to rid himself of his Bank of America loan . The sale of the Kings was supposed to be a major step_in addressing McNall ' s growing financial problems , which have stemmed from such factors as steep debt payments , a soft market in rare coins and what he has described as a financially unfavorable lease the Kings have with the Forum . The sale was approved last week by the NHL ' s board of governors , of which McNall is the chairman , and until the last few days appeared headed for conclusion when the investigation came_to_light . Sources close to Sudikoff and Cohen said that Sudikoff ' s prospective lenders -- believed to be insurance_companies -- have been alarmed by the news and are reluctant to finance the deal . A spokesman for Sudikoff and Cohen said that the two remain committed to doing the deal and declined further comment . Several sources say that Sudikoff has been involved in intense talks with Bank of America to possibly finance the acquisition temporarily until questions surrounding the McNall investigation are cleared_up , at which time Sudikoff would then secure permanent financing to pay_off the bank . Should Sudikoff and Cohen drop_out as prospective buyers , the future of the team would be thrown into doubt . Sources confirmed that Sudikoff has already paid some $ 4 million to help cover the Kings ' payroll . He also is known to have financed the purchase of a $ 275 # 000 Rolls-Royce convertible that McNall presented to Wayne Gretzky in a highly publicized ceremony on March 30 after Gretzky broke Gordie Howe ' s NHL record for goals scored . An NHL spokesman said Commissioner Gary Bettman had no comment . Times staff writer Jim Newton contributed to this story .</TEXT>
