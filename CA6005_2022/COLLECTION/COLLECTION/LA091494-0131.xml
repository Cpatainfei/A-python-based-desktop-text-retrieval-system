   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TRY TO STOP ARBOR PARK CONDOS ; DEVELOPMENT : COUNTY PANEL APPROVED THE VALENCIA PROJECT ON 20 ACRES OF FLOOD_CONTROL PLAIN LAST MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two environmental groups have appealed the preliminary county approval of a 195-unit condominium project along a tributary of the Santa Clara River because they claim that the residences could be subject_to flooding . The Los Angeles County Regional Planning_Commission gave unanimous approval last month to the first phase of the Arbor Park project , which would place the condominiums on 20 acres of flood_control plain next to Bouquet Creek in Valencia . The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the project Nov . 6 . But the condos will be subject_to flooding because of the development ' s proximity to the river , said Lynn Plambeck , vice_president for the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment ( SCOPE ) . Flood_control measures that narrow the river will speed it up , causing flooding , reducing ground_water supplies and eroding downstream property , Plambeck said . In addition , she said , the project appears to be above an earthquake fault . Plambeck said the housing project is relatively small , but she noted that commercial development and other projects also are planned for the area . &quot; We need to address the cumulative impact of various projects , &quot; she said . &quot; If we allow one project to go_in , they will continue to do projects in the flood plain. &quot; The appeal , filed last week by SCOPE and Friends of the Santa Clara River , is necessary so that the Board of Supervisors will review the project in detail , Plambeck said . Most of Bouquet Creek has been lined with concrete during the past three years by the developer , Newhall Land and Farming Co. , as part of a flood_control plan . Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer said the process , called channelizing , has nothing to do with Arbor Park : it is for an already approved commercial project nearby and to protect a bridge near Newhall Ranch Road . The bottoms of Bouquet Creek and the Santa Clara River are not paved , she added . In addition , Lauffer said , large boulders known as &quot; rip rap &quot; are being placed at the bottom of the river to slow_down the velocity of the water . Lauffer said studies by the county and other government_agencies have not revealed a fault_line under the property . She said a fault_line is nearby , but in that regard , the property &quot; is not that much different than most of Southern California. &quot; The first phase of the project could be completed by the fall of 1995 , with an additional 55 units planned at a future date . Plambeck said the appeal is focusing_on the condominium project because &quot; once they go_in it ' s impossible to design any other way for flood_control measures for the river. &quot; Studies indicate the condominiums will be safe from flooding , Lauffer said . But Plambeck said other supposedly &quot; safe &quot; flood channels have failed . &quot; You really can ' t control a river , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s nice and we think we can control it , but rivers don ' t always do what we expect them to do. &quot;</TEXT>
