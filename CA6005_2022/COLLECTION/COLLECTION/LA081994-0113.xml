   <HEADLINE> EX-SPY RESIGNS POLISH INTELLIGENCE POST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marian Zacharski , the newly appointed chief of Polish intelligence , stepped_down Thursday after an international outcry arose over his past as a top Cold_War spy who stole military secrets from the United States . &quot; Throughout my life , I was always led by what was good for Poland , &quot; he said in a resignation letter . &quot; I do not want to be the cause of conflict among Poles at a moment when Poland most needs agreement and harmony. &quot; His decision to quit less than a week into the job was greeted with relief by Polish officials , who had come_to fear his controversial appointment would undermine Poland ' s campaign to join the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , the alliance Zacharski sought to subvert as a Soviet Bloc spy in the 1970s . NATO forces are scheduled to participate in joint maneuvers in Poland for the first time next month under the alliance ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program , making the furor over Zacharski ' s appointment all_the more awkward for both sides . &quot; I only hope this incident will not adversely influence the American Congress and President Clinton in_regards_to helping Poland militarily , &quot; said Krzysztof Krol , who heads the Confederation for an Independent Poland in Parliament ' s lower house . President Lech Walesa , who Wednesday called_for Zacharski to quit , would not comment Thursday . Under an informal arrangement with the government , Walesa has responsibility for the Interior Ministry , which includes the intelligence service . A top aide to Walesa said the president was not consulted about Zacharski ' s appointment , an assertion viewed with skepticism by many lawmakers . Either way , it was Walesa ' s public rebuke of Zacharski that doomed the former spy ' s short-lived tenure at the helm of the intelligence service . Zacharski was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States in 1981 after obtaining secret information about several highly_sensitive American defense_programs and passing the material to the Soviet_Union . His appointment to the intelligence post was seen as an embarrassment for the United States , which still considers him a criminal . Zacharski was able to collect data on the B-1 bomber , the F-15 fighter and Patriot air-defense missiles after successfully recruiting William Holden Bell , a radar system expert at Hughes Aircraft Co . in El Segundo . Bell provided the Polish spy with copies of documents in exchange for cash . Zacharski returned to Poland in 1985 after an East-West spy exchange . But he received only limited clemency in the United States , meaning he would be subject_to arrest and reimprisonment if he ever traveled here -- even in his capacity as chief of Polish intelligence . Few of Zacharski ' s critics questioned his credentials for the intelligence post . Even Walesa praised his professionalism and experience when asking him to resign . But Zacharski ' s ties to the Communist past left many feeling uneasy about the influence of former Communists in democratic Poland . His departure was interpreted as a victory for democracy . &quot; In the end , the whole shocking incident will be good for Poland , &quot; said Jan Nowak-Jezioranski , head of the Polish American Congress . &quot; It will be seen as a warning to the old nomenclature not to try something like this again. &quot;</TEXT>
