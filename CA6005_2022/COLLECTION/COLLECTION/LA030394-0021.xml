   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : HOW GREEN WAS MY GRANNY_SMITH ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the going gets rough_in the kitchen , I know I can always count_on crisp , juicy Granny_Smith apples . They were originally imported from New Zealand and South_Africa in the mid-1950s . Today , many come from the prime apple-growing valleys of central Washington state . Available year-round , light-green Granny_Smiths have a tart , tangy flavor and firm flesh , qualities that lend themselves to all aspects of cooking . They ' re also excellent for out-of-hand eating . However , they will become mushy and lose their shape when overcooked . Consider the following recipes for a salad , a quick_bread with fresh apple_butter and a warm apple compote . All feature Granny_Smiths in combination with apple cider and orange_zest , two ingredients that enhance the apple ' s appealing flavor . The apple salad with Belgian_endive and watercress is a lightened version of a typical winter bistro salad ; it ' s refreshing , light and filling_in a healthful way . It ' s best served as a first course or as a lunch salad . The apple quick_bread with prunes and walnuts is delicious slathered with fresh apple_butter . The warm curried apple compote with apricots and raisins is a low-fat enhancement to many meats , especially leftovers . A word about citrus zest , an ingredient I use in many of my dishes to boost their flavor . Some readers have asked about it recently . The zest is the aromatic colorful outer skin layer of citrus_fruit ; it must be removed with the aid of a citrus zester ( available in cookware shops ) , a fine grater or a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler or paring knife , all very sharp . Avoid removing the white part of the rind , called the pith -- it ' s bitter and tastes unpleasant . Sharp tools and a light hand will eliminate taking the pith with the zest . Only the colored outer skin has the aromatic oils that , in truth , add a flavorful &quot; zest &quot; to any dish . Moist with apples , prunes and cider , this bread can be served as a simple dessert , with soup or with salad suppers . It ' s perfect combined with the fresh apple Granny Butter , especially when the bread is toasted . APPLE , PRUNE AND WALNUT BREAD WITH GRANNY BUTTER Cake flour 1 1 / 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1 / 2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 1 / 4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 / 2 teaspoon baking soda 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 1 / 2 cup oil 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla 3 tablespoons cider 1 teaspoon grated orange_zest 2 large Granny_Smith apples , peeled , cored , cut_into 1 / 2-inch chunks ( 2 1 / 3 cups ) 1 / 2 cup chopped walnuts 1 / 2 cup snipped prunes Granny Butter Sift 2 cups cake flour , cinnamon , nutmeg , allspice , baking soda and salt onto sheet of wax_paper . Set_aside . Combine oil , sugar , eggs and vanilla in large mixer bowl . Beat 3 minutes . Mixture will be thick and smooth . Add sifted ingredients , cider and orange_zest to mixer . Mix to combine . Toss apples , walnuts and prunes with 1 tablespoon flour in bowl . Then stir into batter with wooden spoon . Batter will be very thick . Generously grease 8x4-inch glass loaf pan . Lightly dust pan with flour , tapping_out excess over sink . Transfer batter to prepared pan . Smooth surface . Bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees until wood pick inserted into center comes_out clean , about 1 hour and 10 minutes . If bread begins to darken too_much toward end of baking , lay piece of foil gently over loaf to prevent from burning . Remove from oven . Let stand on cooling rack 5 minutes . Invert bread onto rack . Let cool completely . Bread , wrapped airtight , will keep few days at room_temperature or frozen 3 months . Cut_into 1 / 3-inch slices . Serve with softened Granny Butter .

Granny Butter 1 / 2 cup chopped Granny_Smith apples 6 tablespoons unsalted butter or margarine , softened 1 / 4 teaspoon allspice 2 tablespoons sugar Dash salt Soften apples in microwave_oven on HIGH power ( 100 % ) in microwave-proof dish . Combine apples with butter , allspice , sugar and salt in processor fitted with metal blade or blender until smooth . Transfer to small souffle dish . Can be made few days ahead and refrigerated . Let come_to room_temperature before using . This salad is a long way from Waldorf salad . It ' s light and refreshing , a lift to almost any meal , especially when it ' s the first course . Toasted walnuts , crumbled blue or Roquefort cheese can be sprinkled on the salad , although for my taste , these typical garnishes on winter apple bistro salads are not required . To get a head_start on the salad , toss the apple slices in a little dressing to keep them from turning brown ; they will keep for about one hour in the refrigerator . APPLE SALAD WITH BELGIAN_ENDIVE AND WATERCRESS 4 medium heads Belgian_endive , about 5 ounces each , cut crosswise into 1 / 3-inch slices 1 large bunch watercress , long stems trimmed , rinsed 2 large Granny_Smith apples , unpeeled , split , cored with melon baller , thinly sliced Cider Dressing Combine endive and watercress in large bowl .

Blend . Can be made day ahead and refrigerated . This compote goes especially well with roasted chicken , duck , game , pork , ham , lamb and shrimp . Stirring a small amount of butter into the mixture at the end of cooking rounds_out the flavors of the compote . WARM CURRIED APPLE COMPOTE WITH APRICOTS AND RAISINS 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 cup cider 1 / 3 cup light-brown sugar , packed 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon curry_powder Dash salt 2 large Granny_Smith apples , peeled , cored , cut_into 1 / 2-inch dice 1 / 3 cup raisins 1 / 3 cup snipped dried apricots 2 teaspoons grated orange_zest 1 tablespoon butter Combine cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cider in small dish until smooth .
