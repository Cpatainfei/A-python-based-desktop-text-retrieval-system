   <HEADLINE> MEXICO SUSPECT LINKS POLITICIANS TO PLOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal deputies and at least one senator plotted the Sept . 28 assassination of the second-ranking official in Mexico ' s ruling party and planned to kill a former party chairman and other politicians , an accused conspirator told police , according to a statement released Wednesday . Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez , an aide to congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha , told police that his boss belonged_to two political groups whose purpose was to &quot; rescue the leadership of the country for those who had been displaced , without regard_to what means had to be used to achieve that , &quot; according to a statement from the attorney_general ' s office . The means of eliminating such political reformers included murder , he told police . The hit list included Fernando Ortiz Arana , former chairman of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , which has governed Mexico for 65 years ; Gov . Manuel Cavazos Lerma of the state of Tamaulipas , and Congresswoman Laura Alicia Garza Galindo , head of the Tamaulipas legislative delegation , as well as the slain man , Francisco Ruiz Massieu . The statement said Rodriguez Gonzalez told police that one of the dissident political groups consisted_of deputies and the other was led by Sen . Enrique Cardenas Gonzalez . Cardenas Gonzalez complained to the attorney_general ' s office last week that he was being slandered when other suspects accused him of involvement in the alleged assassination plot . Munoz Rocha is a fugitive and has reportedly been sighted in both Brownsville , Tex. , and the central Mexican state of Hidalgo . Rodriguez Gonzalez was arrested late Monday in the northwestern state of Zacatecas after a dozen other suspects -- most of them his relatives -- were already in custody . His statement corroborated their testimony , according to the attorney_general ' s office . Rodriguez Gonzalez said Munoz Rocha told him in December that he had received an order from one of the political groups to kill ruling party official Francisco Ruiz Massieu , according to the statement . Rodriguez Gonzalez hired his brother , Marco Antonio , to organize the murder plot , giving him more_than $ 300 # 000 to do the job . The money , he told police , came from Abraham Rubio Canales , a jailed politician who had served in Ruiz Massieu ' s gubernatorial administration in the southern state of Guerrero . Other suspects said Rubio Canales blamed Ruiz Massieu for not protecting him when he was convicted of land fraud . According to Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez , his brother twice hired killers -- paying one prospective contract killer about $ 150 # 000 . Both times , they ran_away with the money and did not attempt to commit the murder , police said . On a trip to Las Vegas , Nevada , on Sept . 15 , Mexican Independence_Day , Rodriguez Gonzalez said , he and Munoz Rocha made plans to carry_out the assassination before October . Marco Antonio Rodriguez Gonzalez has not been implicated in the slaying sof Ruiz Massieu . After the murder , Munoz Rocha offered Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez tickets to Paris , but the aide said he could not accept because he did not have a French visa . Instead , the congressman gave him $ 78 # 000 and promised him more , Rodriguez Gonzalez told police . Rodriguez Gonzalez also is being held_on apparently unrelated smuggling and tax fraud charges , stemming from allegations against a warehouse company he ran .</TEXT>
