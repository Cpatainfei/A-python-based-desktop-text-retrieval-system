   <HEADLINE> $ 1-MILLION PRIZE IS OFFERED FOR WAYS TO TEST FOR 2 SEX DISEASES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rockefeller Foundation Monday announced a $ 1-million prize -- one of the largest in medicine -- for development of an easy , low cost diagnostic test for two sexually transmitted diseases which strike more_than 75 million people worldwide . The diseases , chlamydia and gonorrhea , can be cured relatively easily with antibiotics if discovered , but can lead to serious complications , including infant blindness , if left untreated . Current methods of diagnosis are unsuitable because they require equipment unavailable in many areas of the world , and cost about $ 12 a patient , a prohibitive price in developing nations , the foundation said in announcing the award . Entries for the prize will be accepted for five years or until a winner is named .</TEXT>
