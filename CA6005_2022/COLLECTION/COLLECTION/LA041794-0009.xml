   <HEADLINE> RICHARD EDER : IN FANTASY AND IN FACT ; ROALD DAHL : A BIOGRAPHY , BY JEREMY TREGLOWN ( FARRAR , STRAUS &amp; GIROUX : $ 25 ; 322 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Your threat to leave Knopf after this current contract is fulfilled leaves us far from intimidated , &quot; Robert Gottlieb wrote Roald Dahl in 1980 , after a long association that saw &quot; James and the Giant Peach &quot; and &quot; Charlie and the Chocolate Factory &quot; become two of the best-loved and best-selling children ' s books in history . &quot; You ' ve managed to make the entire experience of publishing you unappealing for all_of us . . . . &quot; Gottlieb continued : &quot; To be perfectly clear , let me reverse your threat : Unless you start acting civilly to us , there is no possibility of our agreeing to continue to publish you. &quot; Civilly was not an adverb of Dahl ' s grammar -- boorishly , perhaps , and prodigally , piggishly , generously , childishly and enchantingly . As his editor , of course , Gottlieb knew it . How many editors today , out of sheer self-respect , would dismiss an author who ran_up royalties of about $ 5 million a year ? Dahl stomped over to Farrar , Straus &amp; Giroux for four successful books , huffed along to Viking for one more and died three years ago , leaving_behind an uneasy reputation . He had written virulently about Israel and the Jews , had broken_with his fellow literati -- who never accepted him as one of_their_own -- by denouncing Salman Rushdie instead of Salman Rushdie ' s death sentence ; and had distilled some odd , dark flavors in his writing that put_off children ' s book specialists , though not children . Visiting Dahl ' s grave in Great Missenden , England , Jeremy Treglown found it garlanded with plastic toys and a large onion . He has written the onion . His biography is as fumy , cantankerous and uneven as Dahl himself ; sometimes mean , often funny and yet , after layers of peeling , offering us a fair-minded and even generous portrait . You would n ' t want to know Dahl , perhaps , but you are glad to know of him . Children ' s classics tend to divide into the settling and the unsettling . The first may offer all kinds of distressful adventures along with their magic , but there is a framework that suggests that finally things are golden and OK : for example , &quot; Winnie the Pooh , &quot; &quot; The Wind in the Willows , &quot; the Oz books , &quot; Black Beauty. &quot; The second leave a quivering imbalance , not necessarily dark but perturbing : &quot; Alice in Wonderland , &quot; &quot; The Princess and the Goblin , &quot; Maurice Sendak ' s books and Roald Dahl ' s . Order does not prevail and cannot quite reassure ; on the other hand , it does not suppress a child ' s own disorder . Disorder is liberated instead -- in Dahl , for example , with the dispatching of Charlie ' s unpleasant aunts or , in &quot; The BFG , &quot; with the Big Friendly Giant ' s proclivity for breaking_wind at state occasions . Treglown gives a concise but effective account both of the children ' s books and of the clever , grisly short_stories that Dahl wrote in the 1950s . Without straining , he portrays a Dahl who remarkably resembles his writing : a 6-foot-6 child of a man , with a need to bring_off marvels and slay dragons . All too often both the marvels and the dragon-slaying were performed upon his friends and family , who lived_in a steady din of feats and prowess . As a bachelor in Washington , D.C. , he painted the genitals of the rhinoceroses on the Q Street Bridge . After telling his children bedtime stories of a giant who prepared dreams and blew them through the windows , he put_up a ladder outside the nursery , climbed it and rustled their curtains . When Olivia , his animal-loving daughter , died , Dahl went_for consolation to Geoffrey Fisher , the retired Archbishop of Canterbury , only to leave in a fury when Fisher informed him that heaven had a no-dogs policy . The man ' s life was agitated and agitating ; one in which fantasy was all_the more disruptive because to a considerable measure he made_it come true . Dahl was the son of a wealthy Norwegian ship_broker who settled in England and died when he was young ; he was raised by his mother and several doting sisters . He joined the Royal_Air_Force in World_War_II , and almost immediately crashed in the Egyptian desert after running_out of fuel . He would embroider the embarrassment into a tale of heroic action ; on the other hand , once recovered from severe injuries , he went_on to become an authentic flying hero . Assigned as an air attache in Washington , his real mission was to be a dashing example of British military prowess to capital circles whose Anglophilia Churchill counted as a main war resource . He hung_out with the_likes_of Ian Fleming , C . S . Forester , Martha Gellhorn , Ernest Hemingway ; and made_love to a number of glamorous women including , by his account , Clare Boothe Luce . The Saturday Evening Post printed his embroidered first-person account of being &quot; shot down &quot; ; Walt Disney planned for a while to make a movie from a Dahl scenario about gremlins . In an exchange of correspondence that prefigured his poker-faced fictional fantasies , Dahl warned Disney against depriving the gremlins of their bowler_hats . They might , he wrote , make trouble . Most important , he became the close friend and lifelong protege of Charles Marsh , a wealthy oilman with a taste for fantasy and game-playing equal_to Dahl ' s . Marsh ' s money helped him keep going when he returned to England to write ; his and his wife ' s friendship helped steady Dahl ' s stormy marriage to the actress Patricia Neal . It was a remarkable marriage and it serves as the appropriate centerpiece of Treglown ' s biography . It lasted 30 years , and divided with the drama of a Dahl tale into two sharply contrasting parts . For the first_half Neal was the great figure : a Broadway and Hollywood star , beautiful and loved as well as courted by an array of glamorous friends . She had the money and the fame ; Dahl , whose short_stories had won him modest shares of each , had not yet begun the children ' s books . The inequality made him all_the more flamboyant and imperious ; he dominated or overturned every dinner_table . Neal , by Treglown ' s absorbing account , loved and understood him enough to keep things going . He managed the money ; she made his breakfast and lunch and bathed the babies -- they had five -- before going_to work . Twelve years later , in 1964 , she had three disabling strokes , which put an end to the career , the glamour and her ability to care_for her family . It seems to have been a spectacular if faintly queasy liberation for Dahl . With his first children ' s books catching_fire , he was the moneymaker . At home he became the immensely present father , and the fiercely authoritarian supervisor of Neal ' s long convalescence . Like Mr. Willy Wonka of the chocolate factory , as Treglown points_out , he could be the great magus and panjandrum , both in fantasy and fact . Treglown , a former editor of the Times Literary Supplement , gives a full account of Dahl ' s arrogance , intemperance and bullying qualities . His story of Dahl ' s tantrums with his publishers , which grew worse as he grew more successful , virtually turn him into one of_his_own fairy-story monsters . Yet Dahl ' s monsters had a comic charm ; and so does Treglown ' s Dahl . More important , throughout this combative biography , something else shines through . As in his days in the RAF , Dahl was both a fantasy hero and a real one . He could be revoltingly unpleasant during the years his wife overshadowed him ; yet , he had the great sanity to retreat with apparent weakness into his own strength , and give_up adult fiction for the seemingly modest role of children ' s writer . At home , his insistence on taking ferocious charge of everything including Neal ' s rehabilitation may have been bullying . But it saved her life and gradually encouraged and tormented her into a recovery which , though not complete , allowed her to pursue a genuine if diminished career on the stage and in television . Eventually -- 18 years after the strokes -- Dahl left Neal for Felicity Crosland , with whom he had been having an affair for several years . But Treglown talked at great length with Neal , and more briefly with two of their daughters . ( The second Mrs . Dahl and a third daughter , who is also writing a biography , did not cooperate. ) And what he found was a mixture of gratitude , anger and awe at the memory of this human whirlwind , who blew debris along with dreams in through their windows , and blew them promptly out again through their door .</TEXT>
