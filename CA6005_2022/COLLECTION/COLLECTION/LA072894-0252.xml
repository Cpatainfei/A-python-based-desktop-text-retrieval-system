   <HEADLINE> GROUP SEEKS DISCLOSURE ON USE OF COW HORMONE ; HEALTH : COALITION SAYS THE STATE IS VIOLATING THE LAW BY NOT TRACKING SALES OF THE DRUG . AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS NO DANGER AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A coalition of consumer and environmental groups complained Wednesday that the Wilson Administration has violated state law by refusing to require disclosure of the use of a new synthetic growth_hormone in milk production . Calling the hormone &quot; extraordinarily controversial , &quot; the coalition demanded in a petition that the California Department of Food and Agriculture comply with the law , which it said required the agency to track all sales of livestock drugs having a &quot; hormone-like action. &quot; The coalition said the new drug , commonly known as Posilac and mostly in_use in Southern California , is clearly a hormone within the meaning of the law . The state ' s tracking of its sales , the group said , would provide a way for consumers to determine which dairies use the drug . Labeling of Posilac on milk cartons is not required . &quot; The CDFA has done everything it can to make_it impossible for consumers to just say no to milk produced with synthetic hormones , &quot; said Harry Snyder , director of Consumers Union ' s West Coast office . The complaint produced angry responses from state officials as well as several industry organizations . They accused the Consumers Union of attempting to spread fear among consumers about the safety of milk . Food and Agriculture_Secretary Henry J . Voss , charging that the coalition has &quot; told half-truths , &quot; said his agency is required to track and make public the sales of livestock hormone drugs , but only those found to &quot; have an adverse biological effect on humans or animals. &quot; &quot; Even though Posilac is a protein hormone , it does not meet the criteria set by CDFA and FDA of restricted hormones , those which might be dangerous to the health of livestock or humans , &quot; Voss said . Posilac , approved for use by the federal Food and Drug Administration this year , is injected in cows to increase their milk production . Consumers Union ' s complaint to the state agency is the group ' s latest move_in a long-running battle over the regulation of milk and milk production . The organization , which publishes Consumer Reports magazine , is the only consumer group to consistently focus attention on milk producers , an industry that Snyder contends is more often protected rather than scrutinized by its regulators . Consumers Union was joined in the complaint by the Community Alliance with Family Farmers , a farmers organization , and the California Dairy Campaign , an environmental group . Jeffrey Nedelman , of the Grocery Manufacturers of America , said health studies on the hormone had found its use to be &quot; safe for consumers and cows. &quot; &quot; Calls_for tracking and publishing ( Posilac ) sales information are nothing more_than a thinly disguised effort to mislead consumers that the safety of ( Posilac ) or the safety of milk and milk products from ( Posilac-treated ) cows is somehow in_question , &quot; said Juanita Duggan , vice_president for the National Food_Processors Assn . Consumers Union ' s Snyder acknowledged that there is no evidence that milk produced by cows injected with the hormone is unsafe , but he said the drug ' s long-term effects on cattle and humans has not been fully tested . He said consumers have a right to know if the milk they are drinking was produced by cows treated with the hormone . Snyder contended that health studies have shown a huge increase in udder infections among cows treated with Posilac . He said if there is a mass outbreak of infections it would most likely cause more &quot; puss and bacteria &quot; to be contained in the milk . Although that would not make the milk unsafe , he said , it would lower its quality . But Tom McDermott , director of biotechnology and communications for the St . Louis-based Monsanto Co. , which manufactures the drug , said an FDA panel has considered the infection issue and did not find a link between the drug and udder infections . &quot; The bottom_line is Consumers Union is quite wrong on this issue , &quot; McDermott said . Furthermore , he said any increase in udder infections in California would be detected by milk inspections that could cause immediate sanctions on producers .</TEXT>
