   <HEADLINE> RISING MORTGAGE RATES STUNT NEW HOUSING STARTS ; CONSTRUCTION : GOVERNMENT REPORTS A STEEPER-THAN-EXPECTED 10 % DROP IN U.S. HOME BUILDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rising mortgage rates sapped the home building industry in June as construction starts on new homes and apartments dropped nearly 10 % nationwide and nearly 9 % in the West , the Commerce_Department said Wednesday . The falloff was much steeper than expected and follows a report Tuesday from the National Assn . of Home Builders that said fewer prospective homeowners were touring new projects and builders were increasingly pessimistic about sales . Building activity in the western region -- which is dominated by California -- fell 8.8 % to an annual rate of 320 # 000 units . In California , rising mortgage rates and falling consumer confidence has led Kaufman &amp; Broad -- the state ' s largest home builder -- to lower the number of homes it plans to build during the current fiscal_year , to about 6 # 400 from 7 # 500 , spokesman Greg Romano said . However , Kaufman , which built only 5 # 745 homes last year , as well as other builders and lenders remain optimistic about the state ' s housing market . &quot; It ' s still going_to be a great_year , &quot; Romano said . Residential construction lending in June in California is expected to jump about 30 % from last year ' s level , to $ 918 million -- the highest amount since December , 1991 , according to John Karevoll , who publishes financial and real_estate information for Dataquick Information_Systems in La Jolla . Thomas Leahy , who heads residential construction lending operations at Bank of America , said he expects building loans in California to remain strong this year and in 1995 . &quot; With a slow but steady strengthening in the California economy , we see more and more buyers coming_back into the marketplace , &quot; Leahy said . The Federal_Reserve_Board has pushed_up short-term interest_rates four times this year , driving_up long-term rates that affect mortgages . The housing_industry is especially sensitive to changes in interest_rates , and mortgage rates have climbed sharply since touching bottom last fall . The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , or Freddie Mac , said the 30-year mortgage loan rate last week had risen to 8.72 % -- about 30 % above the low of 6.74 % reached in October last year . That adds nearly $ 300 a month to a payment on a typical $ 100 # 000 mortgage , enough to wipe_out some potential buyers ' ability to qualify for a loan . &quot; The run-up in rates has throttled housing , &quot; said Warren Lasko , executive_vice_president of the Mortgage Bankers Assn . * In June , the annual rate of starts on new homes slumped 9.8 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units , after a revised increase of 1.8 % in May and a 3.2 % fall_in April . Most of the fall_in June building occurred in multiple-unit apartments , which plummeted 35.7 % from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 193 # 000 units . Construction of single-family homes was down 3.3 % to a rate of 1.16 million -- the third straight monthly fall . Even so , starts were 9 % higher than in June , 1993 , when they were running at a rate of 1.25 million . But Lasko of the Mortgage Bankers Assn . said housing has peaked for the year . &quot; The Fed has certainly done its job , &quot; Lasko said . Building activity in June was weaker in every region of the country except the Northeast , where construction picked_up modestly . In addition , applications for permits fell_for a second straight month , suggesting that construction starts may lose more momentum in coming months . Regionally in June , Northeast starts increased 4.5 % to an annual rate of 139 # 000 units . By contrast , starts dropped steeply in the South , by 13.2 % to a rate of 597 # 000 units . In the Midwest , starts were down 9.2 % to a 295 # 000-unit rate . The National Assn . of Home Builders said only 31 % of its members reported good sales in July , down from 36 % in June . They said buyer traffic was deteriorating at project sites so there was little incentive to keep building .</TEXT>
