   <HEADLINE> SLAMMED BY INFLATION , LITHUANIANS TO VOTE ON BOOSTING BANK BALANCES ; REFERENDUM : MEASURE WOULD INCREASE SAVINGS 100-FOLD . OPPONENTS SAY IT WOULD DESTROY ECONOMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How would you like the government to tack a_couple_of zeros on the end of your bank_account balance , increasing your savings by a factor of 100 ? This is the seductive offer Lithuanians will vote on today in a nationwide referendum , which , if approved , would oblige the government to index bank savings to account_for the hyper-inflation that ravaged the country in the early 1990s . Supporters of the measure admit it is unlikely to pass but say that if it does , it will restore economic justice . Opponents -- including the International Monetary Fund , the World_Bank and Lithuania ' s ruling Democratic Labor_Party -- say it will bring more inflation and , in the end , Lithuania ' s economic destruction . Devastating inflation has been a common feature throughout the former Soviet_Union . Street_corners and kitchen_tables in Minsk , Moscow and Kiev echo with complaints like those of Kostas Pietrovsky , 44 , a Vilnius cab driver who has had 10 # 000 rubles in the bank since 1990 . &quot; I could have bought a car . Now I couldn ' t buy a pair of shoes with that money , &quot; he said , angrily swinging his taxi down the narrow , hilly streets here . &quot; What about our babushki , who had set_aside savings to pay_for their own funerals ? Now that funeral money would barely cover a bouquet or wreath , much less a coffin and a grave plot . Someone has to help those people. &quot; But if inflation has been the common post-Soviet denominator , a widespread conviction that the government ought to pick_up the tab for it is almost unique to Lithuania , an Ireland-sized Baltic nation home to 3.7 million people . The seed of this idea was planted in 1991 , when Lithuania -- led by Vytautas Landsbergis and the grass-roots Sajudis movement -- had set_up its own government and was staring_down Soviet tanks in a bold bid for independence . To punish the rebels , Moscow cut_off the flow of Soviet rubles to Lithuanian branches of the Soviet_Union ' s lone citizens savings bank . Panicky Lithuanians asked what good independence would be if the Soviet_Union confiscated their life savings . Fear not , responded Prime_Minister Gediminas Vagnorius -- Landsbergis ' right-hand_man . In the milk-and-honey land of independent Lithuania , Vagnorius promised , the government would cover all confiscated Soviet rubles with new Lithuanian litas . Citizens were encouraged not to touch their ruble accounts -- advice that helped head_off a run_on Lithuania ' s banks -- and the government registered the amounts in each bank_account as of February , 1991 . &quot; My mother listened to that talk_of how an independent Lithuania would protect us by exchanging litas for rubles , &quot; Pietrovsky said . &quot; She then sold all her gold and jewelry at the market and deposited the earnings in the bank . Now look_at her -- without her gold and without her savings. &quot; The old Soviet_Union never did confiscate the accounts ; it collapsed first . Inflation , however , accomplished what the Soviets had only threatened . Vagnorius and Landsbergis -- now leaders of the opposition Conservative_Party -- say the government ought to compensate people for their losses . Doing so would require about 8 billion litas ( $ 2 billion ) -- or roughly two Lithuanian national budgets . Despite the staggering economic realities , the notion of compensation remains popular among Lithuanians , 70 % of whom live from paycheck to paycheck and can put nothing aside . Thousands of voters supported Landsbergis ' petition drive to hold the referendum . But along the way , the original , simple request -- 100 times as much money , thank_you very much -- ballooned into a legislative program . Conservatives , frustrated by two years in the opposition , have tacked_on bills covering everything from fighting organized crime to C-SPAN-style coverage of the Seimas , or Parliament . The poster-sized ballot , crammed front and back with meandering fine print , is so large the elections_commission fears that the usual ballot_boxes won ' t be able to hold all_the paper . The text is so dense that a Lithuanian actress , hired to read the ballot for broadcast to sailors at_sea who wish to vote , needed 44 minutes to get_through it . And it is so confusing that Vagnorius , the referendum ' s architect , is one of the few people in Vilnius who can actually explain it . &quot; The people do not understand any of the ( referendum ' s ) details , &quot; Vagnorius admitted . As he tells it , the core of the referendum is not the savings compensation at all but a review of the privatization process . Conservatives say the ruling party has used privatization to steal choice businesses and real_estate ; the referendum would set_up a special commission to review certain cases . But such talk alarms the IMF , which has said the referendum could discredit Lithuanian privatization . President Algirdas Brazauskas , 62 , says the Conservatives are in favor of &quot; nationalizing &quot; newly privatized businesses . As for the pledge of 100-fold indexing -- which Conservatives continue to dangle before panting voters -- it ' s no longer explicit . Instead , the referendum calls_for selling one-third of Lithuania ' s state-owned property -- exactly which third remains unclear -- and using the earnings for compensation . Vagnorius calculates that scheme would net 10 billion litas , which would mean savings could be indexed 100-fold with money to spare . The IMF and government officials counter that Vagnorius has drastically overestimated the value of Lithuanian property . They also argue that anything near 100-fold indexing would kick_off a new round of inflation and make a mockery of the Lithuanian lita , stable since its introduction in 1993 .</TEXT>
