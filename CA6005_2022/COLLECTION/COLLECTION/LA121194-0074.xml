   <HEADLINE> LATEST IN INCARCERATION OUTDOES ALCATRAZ ; PRISONS : SUPER MAX FACILITY ABOUT TO OPEN IN COLORADO WILL HOUSE THE VERY WORST FEDERAL CONVICTS , THE KIND ONCE SENT TO ISLAND IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY . THERE ' LL BE NO CODDLING HERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; An uncommon level of security. &quot; that ' s the understated way wardens describe the &quot; new Alcatraz &quot; that soon will welcome the nation ' s most violent , incorrigible federal prisoners . The $ 60-million U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility will open in this southern Colorado community of 3 # 500 in a matter of days . It ' s the first federal prison ever built just for the most predatory inmates in the U.S. Bureau of Prisons . Nearly 500 of them will be sent here . Alcatraz on an island in San Francisco Bay was the home of their sort in years past . Then a federal penitentiary in Marion , Ill. , was modified for the purpose . Now comes Super Max . &quot; There ' s no doubt this is a severe program , &quot; said John Vanyur , the prison ' s associate warden . &quot; This is not a typical prison facility . It ' s one of a kind . And it ' s only used for this very small number of people. &quot; There are motion detectors in underground crawl spaces , 1 # 400 remote-controlled sliding steel doors , cameras covering virtually every nook_and_cranny , and 12-foot chain-link fences topped with razor wire . The 7-feet-by-12-feet cells could be described as Spartan . They contain a polished steel mirror ( glass is a weapon ) riveted to the solid concrete wall . The toilet and shower are steel and fixed to the walls , the bed is a slab of concrete covered with a mattress . The only other place to sit is an immovable concrete cylinder in front of a writing table , also concrete . Cells are designed so inmates cannot make eye_contact with other prisoners , or see anything outside except the prison walls and the Colorado sky . The worst inmates will be cell-bound 23 hours a day , five days a week . Those five days , they get an hour of solitary exercise in a cement-walled room ; the other two days , they don ' t get any exercise , period . In their cells , they will receive educational programming on a 12-inch black-and-white television , their meals on trays and their showers , with the water controlled from the outside . Inmates needing counseling from ministers or social_workers will get_it in their cells . Inmates will be sent here from Marion and other federal prisons . Prison officials are not allowed to discuss who will call Super Max home , but they can generalize . &quot; They ' ve demonstrated through highly assaultive behavior , predatory behavior and escape-related behavior that they cannot function in a less-secure prison , &quot; said Louis Winn Jr. , an executive assistant . &quot; They ' ve proven themselves to be extremely dangerous and violent. &quot; Forty-four percent of Marion ' s prisoners have committed murder or at least tried , Winn says . While many inmates sent to Super Max will be serving life sentences , it will not be their home for life . Officials expect inmates to stay no longer than three years before returning to the relative freedoms of ordinary federal prisons . During their time at Super Max , they will be kept_on short leashes and monitored constantly . If inmates have to see doctors or dentists , they will walk only a_couple_of dozen paces and two correctional officers will accompany them , Winn says . One will walk in front with a baton , the only weapon allowed inside the prison , and one will walk behind , holding the chains connected to handcuffs the prisoner will be wearing behind his back . Inmates are allowed up_to three paperbacks to read , but no law books ( only copies of applicable pages ) so no contraband can be smuggled . Visitors remain beyond inch-thick plate-glass designed to withstand hammer blows . If an inmate participates in rehabilitation_programs and stays out of trouble , his confinement can be modified so he can mingle with other inmates and visit the commissary . &quot; Buildings are only one part of the program , &quot; Vanyur said . &quot; The key part is what the staff do and how they interact . They ' re the ones who have to preserve self-esteem and humanity issues -- maintaining dignity but getting_across the message . &quot; You go_back to the Alcatraz example . . . . You all had the same haircut , walked in lock-step down the hallway and didn ' t speak during meals . Those elements of dehumanization , we don ' t have that here . Every individual has his own program . Caseworkers , psychologists and chaplains are going_to come_down and deal with him. &quot; But the security measures go_on and on and on . Plumbing has automatic shut-offs so inmates cannot flood cells . Sprinklers and smoke containment systems are built_in . Matches and cigarette_lighters are forbidden . Smokers must use a lighter built into each cell_wall . Handles on toothbrushes are cut_off to prevent use as weapons . Only pencil stubs are allowed . Pictures of spouses ( no nudity ) are allowed , but frames are not . Escape-minded inmates will have their hopes dashed . Between their cells and freedom lie seven layers of secured steel and cement . Beneath the building is a crawl space with no outlet , monitored by the motion detectors . The prison is surrounded by cleared landscape , those 12-foot fences and razor wire , and six towers occupied by armed guards . Guy wires will be strung over open areas to prevent helicopter escapes . In addition , there are other security_systems federal officers would rather not have prisoners know about and will not discuss . &quot; There ' s obviously a message here and the message is ' We ' re not going_to tolerate your violent behavior or predatory behavior , and in fact if you change that behavior you eventually will get more privileges , ' &quot; Vanyur said .</TEXT>
