   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR ECONOMY ; POLITICS : TECHNOCRATS CITE FAVORABLE ECONOMIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS DESPITE THE MOST CLOSELY CONTESTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN DECADES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the eve of the most closely contested presidential election in six decades , Mexico ' s famed technocrats are campaigning for the economy . And the message they are putting_out is clear : that economic stability can be maintained here despite the growing likelihood of political change . Indeed , in this year of uprisings and assassination , the Mexican economy appears to have stabilized . Stock prices are up , the rise in interest_rates has reversed and the peso is slowly regaining strength . Manufacturing has finally begun to register growth after months of sluggishness and , as a bonus in this oil-rich nation , oil prices have risen to their highest levels since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait . Today , Mexico expects to complete the first non-U.S. highway bond offering ever sold on international markets , highlighting the country ' s role as a leader in innovative financing among developing countries . &quot; This is the reverse of what you might expect this close to an election &quot; with such possibilities for radical change , said one government official . Of course , by U.S. standards , interest_rates -- 15.8 % on Wednesday -- are still too high , and other indicators , such_as a projected trade_deficit , seem less than favorable . And uncertainty remains a watchword . Yet this is the most favorable economic climate Mexico has enjoyed in a decade . Those accomplishments are carefully noted when officials talk_about why outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari should head the new_World Trade Organization being formed as a successor to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . They have also become effective counterpoints to dire warnings of collapse , linked to the outcome of the Aug . 21 presidential election . Campaign bumper stickers for ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Ernesto Zedillo with the message &quot; I Vote for Peace &quot; carry a thinly veiled threat that an opposition victory will mean instability . Businessmen such_as Roberto Hernandez , president of both the Mexican Bankers Assn . and Mexico ' s largest bank , have been more blunt . Hernandez was widely lampooned last month after he told an agribusiness seminar that of the nine presidential candidates , only Zedillo provides the certainty needed to bring interest_rates down to their February level of 10 % . Typical of the scorn his comments incurred was a cartoon in the independent newspaper La Jornada that depicted the banker threatening : &quot; We have the country ' s capital held hostage . If Ernesto does not win , there could be instability and uncertainty. &quot; The technocrats make_it clear that they expect Yale-educated economist Zedillo -- who is , after all , one of_their_own -- to win . But they dispute the possibility that an opposition victory will mean economic disaster , as some U.S. economists insist . For example , the respected CIEMEX-WEFA economic group based in Pennsylvania , referring to the center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , in third place in most polls , warned that &quot; a PRD victory may cause capital outflows , loss of international reserves and strong pressures on the peso that could force a devaluation. &quot; The economics group forecasts fewer problems if the second-place National Action Party , which has supported free-market reforms , were to win . Certainly , the possibility of an opposition victory after 65 years of one-party rule is inherently somewhat unsettling . However , changes via election seem tame compared to what Mexico has already been through this year , from a Jan . 1 Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas to the March 23 assassination of ruling party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . The murder , especially , provoked devaluation jitters . The central_bank spent up_to $ 9 billion from international reserves to keep the peso from crashing in April , according to an estimate by the Mexico City-based economic analysts Grupo de Economistas y Asociados . To slow the exit of dollars , the government decided to relieve investors of currency risk by stepping_up its offering of dollar-denominated treasury_bonds , called Tesobonos . The bills rose from 3 % of the government ' s debt on Jan . 1 to 42 % last month . &quot; We managed to give investors a hedge ( against devaluation ) without capital flight , &quot; said Treasury Minister Pedro Aspe . As evidence of renewed faith in the peso , the government plans to cut the offering of Tesobonos to 37 % of the treasury debt auctioned next month . Economic officials are adamant that a devaluation is not imminent , whatever the election outcome , and cite a spurt in exports as proof . &quot; Our exports have increased 27 % , &quot; said another high-ranking government official , who , like many others interviewed , spoke on condition that he not be identified . &quot; Where can you see this kind of increase when there are exchange_rate problems ? When there are exchange_rate problems , there are also export problems. &quot; Further , they are certain that ongoing free-market reforms -- which trimmed the triple-digit inflation of 1987 to a projected 6 % this year and reduced government debt to 10 % of the gross_domestic_product from 75 % in 1986 -- are so clearly the right course for this nation that they will be followed by whoever is elected this month . All three major presidential candidates have said they favor the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , the cornerstone of Mexico ' s new economic program . A resulting surge in U.S. exports to Mexico , economists here say , has helped lower inflation and made Mexican manufacturers more competitive by giving them access to better and cheaper machinery and raw_materials . Government economists even look_to free-market economics to resolve the problems of poverty that led to the Indian uprising in Chiapas that was timed to upstage implementation of NAFTA . &quot; There is no way to solve the problem of Chiapas without attracting investment , &quot; said one official . The Mexican Economy With inflation in check and a growing gross_domestic_product , the Mexican economy is enjoying a relatively stable period .
