   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; IT ' S V FOR VICTORY FOR GERMANY ' S WEISSFLOG ; SKI_JUMPING : THE 1984 GOLD MEDALIST EDGES FELLOW VETERAN BREDESEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Youth was served handsomely only two years ago in Olympic ski_jumping , but Sunday was old-timers ' day on the large hill here . German Jens Weissflog and Norwegian Espen Bredesen , a_couple_of veterans who had to change styles in mid-career when the V-technique became all_the rage a_few years ago , dueled on a sunny day at the Lysgardsbakkene ski_jumping arena , the Olympic venue that dominates the scene here . Weissflog , 29 , who last won Olympic gold at Sarajevo in 1984 , when the German Democratic Republic was still the polite name for his country , East_Germany , and a unified country was the farthest thing from any German ' s mind , uncorked a stylish second jump of 436 feet 4 inches off the 120-meter slide and beat_out Bredesen , 26 , the favorite . Austrian Andreas Goldberger , baby-faced and apple-cheeked at 21 , upheld the honor of the youth brigade by taking the bronze . But nothing was heard from the teen-age stars of the Albertville Games , Toni Nieminen of Finland and Martin Hoellwarth of Austria , simply because they weren ' t good_enough to make their Olympic teams . &quot; Toni grew_up this much ( six inches ) and has had trouble finding the right balance , &quot; said the Finnish delegation ' s Matti Salmenkyla of Nieminen , who won two golds and a bronze at Albertville . Meanwhile , Weissflog and Bredesen , who have been battling all season on the World Cup circuit , carried_on in that tradition Sunday . First it was Bredesen , soaring 444 feet 6 inches , the longest_jump of the day , in the first round , knocking Weissflog out of the lead he had given himself 12 jumpers earlier with a leap of 424 feet 10 inches . Bredesen ' s landing was less than perfect , but his hill-record leap left him with a 10-point lead before the second round . &quot; The first jump was a good jump , &quot; Bredesen said . &quot; Not a super jump but a good . I had a little wind and that helped. &quot; Neither had any appreciable lifting wind in the second round . Weissflog ' s big effort -- the length and style on his second jump were worth 140.4 points and gave him a two-jump total of 274.5 -- gave Bredesen something to shoot at and he came_up short , soaring 400 feet 3 inches and settling for a total of 266.5 points . Goldberger , 1993 World Cup champion , finished with jumps of 421-7 and 398-7 , good for 255 points . &quot; My first jump was really very good , &quot; Weissflog said . &quot; It was not ideal , compared to Espen ' s , but the second one was even better . After the first round , I thought it would be impossible to catch_up -- but there ' s always a second round. &quot; Weissflog actually won two medals in ' 84 , the gold on the normal hill and the silver on the big . &quot; Considering that I won this one on the big hill , I ' d have to say today is the most important victory of my career , &quot; Weissflog said . Not many years ago , there were serious questions whether Weissflog would compete again in the Olympics . Swedish jumper Jan Boklov pioneered the V-style in 1985 , spreading the tips of his skis while keeping the tails together . In the classical style , the jumper kept his skis parallel and leaned over them while in the air . Boklov ' s new_style drew gibes at first , but gradually other skiers tried it and by 1989 , after it had been shown that the V funneled more lifting air onto the jumper ' s chest -- resulting in longer_jumps -- it was being touted as the wave of the future . Young jumpers took_to it readily , not so those who grew_up keeping their skis together . Both Weissflog and Bredesen , who had been hailed as Norway ' s next great jumper , were caught in the switches and the young lions had their day at Albertville . &quot; I tried to change before the last Olympics , but it takes at least a year to get_it right , &quot; Bredesen said . &quot; It ' s hard to change . But I ' ve had a_couple_of years now and it ' s OK. &quot; Weissflog ' s adjustment was apparently even more difficult . &quot; I had many problems and I doubted that I could make the change at all , &quot; he said . &quot; Even last year , in the V-style , I was not very stable . But this year I feel I have really mastered it. &quot;</TEXT>
