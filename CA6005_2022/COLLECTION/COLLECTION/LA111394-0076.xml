   <HEADLINE> BAD MEDICINE : PHONY SHAMANS PREY ON THE DESPERATE AND THE ILL ; SPIRITUALITY : CHARLATANS OPERATE IN CITIES , FAR FROM THEIR HOMES , AND CHARGE EXORBITANT FEES . ASKING FOR MONEY IS THE TIP-OFF , LEGITIMATE TRIBAL HEALERS SAY -- DOING SO IS FORBIDDEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mystique of pulsing drums and chanting singers , healing rituals depicted in movies such_as &quot; Dances With Wolves , &quot; is causing headaches among authentic Native_American medicine_men . Non-Indians with terminal diseases such_as AIDS or cancer are seeking them out_in growing numbers for cures . New-Agers and others , forsaking their own heritage , offer cash to attend spiritual ceremonies . Of even more concern to tribal spokesmen are what they call &quot; plastic &quot; medicine_men , or frauds posing as medicine_men . Often living_in the cities , they charge exorbitant prices for healing and spiritual ceremonies . Indian leaders believe medicine_men lose their powers and stir_up evil and disharmony if they leave the place where the Creator gave them their powers . &quot; A lot of their power comes from the area where they were born , &quot; said Charles Cambridge , a Navajo and anthropologist who teaches ethnic studies at the University of Colorado in Denver . Cambridge belongs_to the Folded Arms Clan with family lands near Shiprock , N . M. , on the Navajo reservation . Cambridge says most fraudulent medicine_men fall_into two categories -- apprentices who dropped_out , and untrained people who &quot; decided to con non-Indians for economic reasons. &quot; He believes that when an authentic medicine_man moves to the city for economic reasons , he has become selfish and will start losing his powers . &quot; The cures and rituals people will undergo with him become dangerous because these rituals have become an evil force -- everything that is done becomes disruptive instead of healing , &quot; Cambridge said . Rick Two Dogs , a respected Oglala Lakota medicine_man at Porcupine on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South_Dakota , traces his medicine-man lineage back at least 250 years . He says when he received his vision , he was told to stay there and help his people . &quot; If you are an authentic medicine_man , the powers you draw from the Earth are here ; the people we are supposed to help are here , &quot; said Two Dogs . &quot; The gift to heal follows the blood line. &quot; &quot; After the movie ' Dances With Wolves , ' we ' ve had a lot of people with Sioux blood using that as a springboard to line their own pockets &quot; by posing as spiritual healers , said Tim Giago , an Oglala Lakota and publisher of Indian Country Today in Rapid City , S.D. His newspaper has an ongoing series of stories about the problem . &quot; It is like someone showed_up in Denver with a black robe and white collar saying he ' s an ordained Catholic priest , simply because it ' s something he thinks he should do , &quot; Giago said . He says heredity is the true test of a shaman , or medicine_man . &quot; If you can find a medicine_man who started three or four years ago because he had a dream , that ' s a bunch of baloney , &quot; Giago said . &quot; It takes decades of instruction to become a legitimately recognized holy_man of any tribe. &quot; The charging of fees -- up_to thousands of dollars to &quot; cure &quot; a terminally ill AIDS or cancer patient -- is the big tip-off the medicine_man is a fraud . &quot; Traditional medicine_men are not allowed to charge a fee , &quot; said Two Dogs . &quot; If people want to give us something , we ' ll accept it . But we can ' t ask_for a fee. &quot; Such gifts usually include tobacco , food , clothing or other useful items , to show respect and appreciation for the medicine_man ' s service . Two Dogs , 43 , says the last two years has seen a sharp increase in non-Indians seeking_out medicine_men , but the trend began a decade ago . Two Dogs says terminally ill white people approach him on the reservation for cures . Others ask him to teach them the Lakota spiritual ways . &quot; I ' ve had people approach me with cancer and a_few people with AIDS , but I said I can ' t help them , &quot; Two Dogs said . The first thing they would say is , ' I would give you $ 5 # 000 or $ 10 # 000 . . . . ' I say , ' I can ' t help you because of the way you approached me . It is not a question of money. ' &quot; A lot of them want to learn the spiritual ways . I say , ' I can ' t teach you these ways . . . . You can pray in any way you want to , but to learn the true Lakota way you must be a Lakota. ' &quot; &quot; Many passing themselves off as medicine_men will mix approaches &quot; used by different tribes , said John Compton , an elder of the Brule Sioux of the Rosebud Reservation in South_Dakota and now a director in the federally funded National Native Elders Health_Care Resource Center in Denver . &quot; More and more stuff is being published by these people . Sun Bear made big bucks selling a lot of how-to-do-it books . This is sad because a lot of people out there really are seeking guidance and spiritual renewal and they ' re ripe for this kind of stuff. &quot; Terry Knight , 45 , spiritual spokesman for the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in southwestern Colorado and son of a respected Ute medicine_man , Charley Knight , describes himself as a &quot; fledgling ceremonial person. &quot; &quot; A lot of people rush into this with the intent of making money and being recognized as a medicine_man , &quot; Knight said . &quot; The true medicine_man is not into that . It ' s a lifelong job , a 24-hour-a-day job , a very tough job . I ' m in no hurry to become a medicine man. &quot; Knight said he has been approached by non-Indians to perform ceremonies &quot; and it ' s very tempting indeed . But I just tell them I can ' t do_it . It would just be sacrilegious. &quot; Asked how a Ute becomes a medicine_man , Knight replied : &quot; It ' s up_to the Creator and the grandfather spirit that will approve and say you are worthy . . . . You ' ve got_to have the gift from the Creator and grow_into it. &quot;</TEXT>
