   <HEADLINE> IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO KEEP IT A SECRET ; SUPREME COURT MUST NOT SUPPRESS IRAN-CONTRA REPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The broad outline of the Iran-Contra scandal has long been clear . President Ronald Reagan , eager to secure the release of American hostages being held by terrorists in Lebanon , sought by secretly violating the U.S. embargo on arms sales to Iran to bribe that country into helping . Then , without Reagan ' s knowledge , his national security adviser , John M . Poindexter , and Poindexter ' s aide , Lt . Col . Oliver L . North , diverted some of the profit from the arms sale to guerrillas seeking the overthrow of the government of Nicaragua , secretly violating a congressional ban on such aid . When the scandal broke_in 1986 , Lawrence E . Walsh was appointed as independent counsel to prosecute and investigate the case . The law under which the appointment was made -- a law now expired but likely to be revived -- dates_back to the Watergate era and was intended to guarantee that the executive_branch of government would not be above the law or beyond public scrutiny . Both goals were formally recognized under the law . The independent counsel ( or &quot; special prosecutor &quot; ) was to be named by the judiciary rather than the executive and was not just to prosecute criminal wrongdoing , if any , but also to issue a final , air-clearing report . The final report , an exercise required of no conventional prosecutor , was to cover those who were not indicted as well as those who were , because the abuse of power is wrong even when it is legal . The prosecution phase of Iran-Contra is now complete . Walsh ' s 14 indictments led to 11 guilty pleas or convictions . Two convictions were overturned ; five cases ended in pardons by President George_Bush . The investigation phase of Iran-Contra seemed about to end on Dec . 3 , 1993 , when a three-judge federal appeals court in Washington announced that it was about to release the report , minus some classified material . On that day , however , unnamed parties brought motions , which the three judges troublingly agreed to keep secret , requesting that the judges reverse themselves and suppress the report either in whole or in part . Last Friday , the same panel , having reviewed its earlier decision , confirmed it but gave the unnamed parties 10 days to appeal_to the Supreme Court , presumably with a second set of secret motions . The unnamed parties , sources have told the Associated Press , are Reagan , North , ( now a Senate candidate in Virginia ) and former Atty . Gen . Edwin Meese III . If the Supreme Court agrees to review the decision of the appeals court , we can only hope that it will at the very least require those requesting its intervention to identify themselves in court and make their arguments for the record . But our deeper hope is that Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist , whose role will be crucial , will recognize the immense harm that would be done to the credibility of government if a $ 35-million , tax-funded investigation should become an &quot; eyes only &quot; report for those who were themselves the objects of the investigation . The Bush pardons placed a serious question_mark at the end of the Iran-Contra prosecution phase . A suppression of the Walsh report at the behest of Reagan , Meese and North would place a disastrous question_mark at the end of the Iran-Contra investigation as_a_whole .</TEXT>
