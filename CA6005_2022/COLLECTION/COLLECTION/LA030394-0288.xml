   <HEADLINE> IN RUSSIA , BOSNIA SERB LEADER BLASTS U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Radovan Karadzic , the leader of the Bosnian Serbs , blasted the United States on Wednesday for usurping the role of the United Nations in making_peace in the former Yugoslav federation , saying Russia is a more &quot; impartial and reliable &quot; mediator in the conflict . &quot; I don ' t think that the United States of America could be possibly at_the_same_time biased in favor of Muslims and impartial , &quot; he said on the second day of a visit to Russia , a traditional patron that has pressured the Bosnian Serbs into two major concessions that the United Nations has been unable to extract from them . Lashing back , Karadzic said the United Nations should not be &quot; abandoned , &quot; leaving only one power -- presumably the United States -- to arbitrate the conflict . Speaking_to reporters in English and Russian , Karadzic said he is still studying the agreement signed Tuesday in Washington between the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Bosnian Croat separatists to form a federated state , whose boundaries would include large chunks of territory now under Serbian control . Outmaneuvered by both Washington and Moscow , Karadzic touted Slavic solidarity , then headed_off to watch a soccer match with Russia ' s best-known booster of the Serbs , ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . Zhirinovsky , who has said that any NATO air strikes against the Serbs in Bosnia would be tantamount_to a declaration of war against Russia , had met with Karadzic during a recent visit to the former Yugoslav federation . &quot; We understand each other quite well , &quot; Zhirinovsky said . &quot; He speaks in Russian without translators , and we are satisfied with each other ' s positions. &quot; It would be best for Russia to be neutral in the conflict in the former Yugoslav republics , Zhirinovsky said . &quot; But in principle , we are more on the side of the Slavic_peoples and Orthodox peoples. &quot; He also heaped scorn on the United States ' latest efforts to try to resolve the Muslim-Croat conflict . &quot; What is new in the American initiative ? There is nothing new , &quot; Zhirinovsky said . &quot; They are threatening , setting conditions . The best initiative would be to leave Bosnia , Herzegovina and Montenegro ( the last of which composes , with Serbia , the rump Yugoslavia ) in peace. &quot; Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party ' s &quot; shadow foreign_minister , &quot; lawmaker Alexei V . Mitrofanov , said that , in principle , they support a withdrawal of all foreign troops from the former Yugoslav federation . Mitrofanov said he believes that &quot; the United States has an interest in keeping_up this source of destabilization in the center of Europe. &quot; Nevertheless , he called the Russian initiative to send peacekeepers in return for Serbian concessions &quot; a step_in the direction we pointed out. &quot; &quot; It is good to have Russian troops in Bosnia , &quot; Mitrofanov said . &quot; To try bombing Bosnia while there are 400 Russian paratroopers in blue helmets there is to walk on a tightrope. &quot; In fact , while expressing deep sympathy with its traditional Serbian allies and fellow Orthodox Christians -- thus depriving Zhirinovsky and his nationalist allies of sole political ownership of the emotional issue -- Moscow has twice in the last two weeks forced the Bosnian Serbs to bow to international demands . Russian promises to send peacekeepers to Sarajevo helped persuade the Bosnian Serbs to comply with a North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ultimatum to remove or surrender heavy artillery inside a 12-mile zone around Sarajevo by Feb . 21 . And on Tuesday , Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev announced that the Bosnian Serbs will allow the Tuzla airport to reopen , provided Russian observers are present to guarantee that only humanitarian cargo is brought_in . The latter concession , which came only a day after NATO shot down four Bosnian Serb warplanes , was &quot; difficult for them , &quot; said Vladimir F . Shumeiko , chairman of the Federation Council , the upper house of the Russian Parliament .</TEXT>
