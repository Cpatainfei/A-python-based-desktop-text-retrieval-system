   <HEADLINE> THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JOB ; SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS NOT RELEVANT IN EMPLOYMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you are denied a job because of your race , religion or gender , legal remedies are available to you . The law is_on your side . But if you are denied a job because of your sexual orientation , you are without legal remedy in 42 of the 50 states . Legal remedies would be unnecessary , of course , if discrimination did not occur . But it does occur . When Barbara Boxer was elected to the Senate in 1992 , Peter Teague moved from San Francisco to Washington to take a position on her staff . His companion , a lawyer with a thriving practice , went_with him expecting to find work easily . Interviews with law_firms went well until the inevitable question about why the move had taken_place . The answer cooled the initial warmth to &quot; Don ' t call us , we ' ll call you. &quot; Teague ' s partner now has a job , thanks at least in part to a District_of_Columbia law that forbids job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . California has such an anti-discrimination law too . But can protection against job discrimination be extended_to all homosexuals as a matter of federal statute ? Last month the Human_Rights Campaign Fund , an organization defending gay and lesbian equality at the federal level , announced that it had written confirmation from 71 of the 100 U.S. senators that they would not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation when hiring for their Senate offices ; 234 of 435 U.S. representatives have made the same promise . These promises undoubtedly reflect the legislators ' conscience on this matter . They should vote their consciences when the Employment Nondiscrimination Act comes_before them later this summer . This legislation , which has 32 sponsors in the Senate and 107 in the House , exempts small businesses , religious organizations and the military . It requires no quotas or preferential treatment of any kind . It does not require that employers pay spousal benefits for same-sex partners . It merely requires that no one be denied employment because of sexual orientation . People should be hired or fired on the basis of their work . The Times urges swift approval of this modest and reasonable measure .</TEXT>
