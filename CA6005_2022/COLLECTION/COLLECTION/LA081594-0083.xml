   <HEADLINE> DESIGNERS IN THE DRIVER ' S SEAT ; INNOVATIVE SOUTHLAND FIRMS ARE HAVING A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON THE SHAPE OF THE AUTO ' S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charles W . O . Ellwood , an English-born car designer who has spent most of his career in Germany , had an epiphany of sorts when he arrived in Southern California last October to take the helm of Volkswagen ' s design studio in Simi Valley . The American motorist ' s fascination with cup holders , he says , suddenly made_sense . &quot; You can ' t drive the speeds we drive_in Europe and use cup holders ; it ' s just too dangerous , &quot; says Ellwood , 39 , former chief of interior_design at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg , Germany . &quot; But here , you ' re living in the vehicle , you ' re drinking in the vehicle , the kids are moving_back_and_forth . You ' re doing a lot of things other_than driving. &quot; Car_makers have been coming_to similar realizations since they began flocking to the West Coast 20 years ago . From cup holders built into dashboards to the sleek coupes seen pulling_out of driveways , the Southern California influence has been profound . Although most auto designs are still produced in Detroit , Tokyo , Wolfsburg and other motor_cities , &quot; probably the best designs in the world are coming_out of California &quot; because the environment is conducive to creativity , says Jess Harder , chief designer at International Automotive Design in Huntington Beach . The Miata two-seat ragtop was born in Mazda ' s design studio in Irvine . Toyota designers in Newport Beach created the Previa minivan and the Lexus SC 300 and 400 models . Southern California studios also produced the 1993 Ford Probe and Chevrolet ' s 1994 Camaro , models that revived sports coupe sales . Today , 16 satellite studios and a handful of independent automotive design firms throughout the region are shaping the futures of General Motors , Ford , Volvo , BMW and Volkswagen , to name a_few . It was the expertise in seat design of Designworks / USA in Newbury Park that caught the attention of BMW in the late 1980s , says Charles W . Pelly , president of Designworks . The German auto_maker has since purchased 60 % of Designworks ' stock , and now accounts_for a third of the studio ' s business . Volkswagen ' s updated version of the classic Beetle , promised for delivery to dealers in 1998 , was designed in Simi Valley . The company is hoping the new Beetle will catch the fancy of 21st Century drivers as the original did_in the 20th . Designers for other car_makers are also under the gun to divine the whims of the next century . The stakes are monumental . To take a design from sketches to cars on_the_road can take more_than five years and cost $ 1 billion or more . And American and European car_makers , since losing market share to Japanese competitors in the 1980s , know they cannot afford to neglect a single nuance of design . Thomas V . Peters , head of GM ' s studio in Newbury Park , says flatly : &quot; This is war. &quot; California , then , is a strategic battlefront . The state accounts_for 10 % of new car registrations in the United States each year and 3 % of new registrations worldwide . To succeed in California , car_makers have decided , it makes_sense to be in California , where the sunshine shows_off a car ' s finish and reveals the flaws or grace of every curve , where car-crazy consumers are quick to embrace a fresh design and quicker to discard a stale one , and where trends seem to land like drops of water and ripple over the rest of the country . Designers at local studios work in high-tech security buildings to guard against industrial spying . &quot; Paranoia runs rampant , &quot; said Ronald Powers , president of Powers Design International , an independent design firm in Newport Beach . Designers furtively scour the Southern California landscape for hints of shifting consumer tastes , looking_for clues_in everything from computer terminals to electric_mixers to athletic shoes . &quot; Our influences range from man-made to nature , American to international , &quot; says Douglas Halbert , chief designer at Honda Research and Development in Torrance . Some have adopted an academic approach . Volvo ' s Camarillo design center , for example , employs a staff sociologist to track changes in consumer attitudes . &quot; This is a think_tank , &quot; says Sylvia S . Voegele , general_manager at Volvo ' s studio . &quot; When we present a design , we also present who we think it would sell to and why. &quot; Designers say that working in Southern California gives them a dual competitive edge . Living amid the highest concentration of car enthusiasts in the world allows them to sense taste trends and driving amid the world ' s largest variety of cars provides constant style inspiration . When Tom Matano oversaw the design of the Miata , he pictured himself driving the car on Pacific Coast Highway from Laguna Beach up_to Malibu . The RX7 , also designed in Mazda ' s California studios , was envisioned as a model that athletic_types would drive to the gym for workouts . Designers in New York and Tokyo -- who take the train to work -- would not have designed the kinds of cars that are popular in California , Matano says . &quot; Part of being a designer is being a visionary , &quot; says Dave Hackett , general_manager of Toyota ' s Newport Beach design studio , which is the oldest of the Southern California studios . &quot; Based on what we see today , we have to predict what people will want three to five years from now. &quot; Typically , the manufacturer will specify wheelbase and engine layout , then request a new design or an updating of a model already in production . As soon as the order arrives the designers commence sketching , and the weeding-out process begins . The designers compete with each other ; studios compete with other studios within the company and with independent design studios . And , finally , the car_makers compete in the marketplace . Ford ' s studio in Valencia has fared well in these contests . Hastily assembled in 1983 after GM had laid plans for its Newbury Park facility , the Ford studio produced a winner right away -- the 1989 edition Thunderbird . Since then , the studio has had a string of successes , including major influence on the 1993 Probe . Sales of that sports coupe surged 42 % from 1992 . But now , even Hutting acknowledges that Ford , the domestic design leader since it introduced the top-selling Taurus sedan in the mid-1980s , has surrendered the mantle to Chrysler , whose striking new_line was developed at the Chrysler Pacifica studio in Carlsbad . Ford , Hutting says , must find ways to reassert itself . One of the key challenges will be to anticipate trends in the minivan and sport utility vehicle markets , segments that barely existed a decade ago but last year accounted_for 16 % of Ford ' s domestic sales ( 564 # 916 units ) . Searching for clues to the future of these markets , Hutting and his design team are paying close attention to societal trends , such_as the four-day work week . If that trend broadens , consumers may use vehicles less for commuting and more for leisure-time driving . While Ford was turning heads with the Taurus , GM was turning stomachs with the Caprice , a whale of a car that went belly up_on arrival . GM lost U.S. market share_in the last decade but has had better luck with the 1994 Chevrolet Camaro , based largely on an aerodynamic Newbury Park design . U.S. sales of the Camaro and its Pontiac Firebird sibling totaled 76 # 602 during the first five months of 1994 , compared to 21 # 509 cars of the previous design during the equivalent period of 1993 . &quot; GM finally gets_it , &quot; says Gordon Wangers , an analyst with Vista-based Automotive Marketing Consultants Inc. &quot; The Camaro could be a car that will turn GM around. &quot; Volkswagen has pinned similar hopes on the Concept One , the working name for a smooth , symmetrical successor to the Beetle . U . S . Beetle sales peaked at 367 # 607 in 1969 , but Volkswagen sales have fallen_off the charts since 1977 , when the last Beetle was sold in the United States . Volkswagen spokeswoman Lana Ferrari says that since January , when the Concept One was unveiled at the Detroit auto show , the company has fielded 30 # 000 calls and collected 5 # 000 letters from VW fans urging the company to build the new Beetle . For all its nostalgic appeal , the Concept One is no replica , says Ellwood , head of Volkswagen ' s Simi Valley studio . The car is capable of running_on electricity -- an important capacity since California law requires that 2 % of all vehicles sold in the state in 1998 be emissions-free . Unlike its predecessor , the Concept One has a front engine , front-wheel drive , anti-lock brakes , dual air_bags and , of course , &quot; cup holders front and rear , &quot; Ellwood says with a chuckle . &quot; We paid particular attention to that. &quot;</TEXT>
