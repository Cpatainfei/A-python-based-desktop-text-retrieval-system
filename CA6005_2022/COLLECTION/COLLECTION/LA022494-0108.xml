   <HEADLINE> ZAPPING OIL SPILLS WITH DRY_ICE AND INGENUITY ; INVENTIONS : TIM BECK SAYS HE ' S DISCOVERED A WAY TO FREEZE OIL AND SIMPLIFY THE CLEANUP EFFORT . AND THE TECHNIQUE COULD BE USED TO FIGHT FIRES AS WELL . SKEPTICS ARE A LITTLE COOL TO THE IDEA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It all started with the Huntington Beach oil spill in 1990 , when Tim Beck stood on the beach watching a black tide of crude_oil heading into shore . &quot; It just kept getting closer and closer ( to the beach ) ) , and nobody showed_up to save the day , &quot; says Beck , 45 , a Manhattan Beach inventor and , to make ends meet , an El Segundo substitute science_teacher . &quot; I started thinking there had to be some way to stop an oil spill. &quot; Then it came_to him . Why not use massive heat extraction ? In other words , why not freeze the oil ? Turn the liquid oil spill into a frozen oil spill -- an &quot; oilberg &quot; as Beck calls it . Then you could simply pluck the chunks of oil right off the water , simple as fishing an ice_cube out of a highball . It was simple , it was ingenious -- and it took Beck three years to figure_out how to do_it . Now , he says , the concept is proven . Of course , as with any invention , Beck says , there are doubters , naysayers , flat-worlders . But we ' ll get_to that later . The idea of freezing oil came almost naturally to Beck , who has freezing experience . For 12 years Beck , who has a master ' s degree in biology from UCLA , ran a kidney bank at which the organs were preserved by supercooling techniques . Beck ' s first idea for freezing oil spills was to use liquid_nitrogen , which at nearly minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit is plenty cold enough to freeze oil or almost anything else . Only problem was , it ' s so cold that it might also freeze the oil-spill workers along with the oil . He had to scratch that idea . Then Beck thought_about using frozen carbon_dioxide -- that is , dry_ice -- as the heat extraction agent . The only problem was that oil experts said dry_ice , at minus 109 degrees Fahrenheit , isn ' t cold enough to freeze crude_oil . Beck discovered that it was indeed cold enough , once the gases contained in crude_oil dissipated into the air . * The problem then was figuring_out how to put dry_ice on an oil spill . You couldn ' t just dump blocks of dry_ice in the oil-covered water , because dry_ice doesn ' t float . Finally Beck found a company in Rancho Cucamonga , Alpheus Cleaning Technologies , that manufactures dry_ice pellets for &quot; ice blasting , &quot; which is like sandblasting except that dry_ice is used . For about 15 cents a pound , the company sells dry_ice pellets about an eighth of an inch long and about the thickness of spaghetti -- small enough to float , big enough to freeze oil . Beck started taking his idea to oil_companies , seeking financing to continue the experiments . But he had a hard_time finding backers . &quot; Oil_companies don ' t like to focus_on oil spills , &quot; he says . &quot; Instead of funding research , they ' d rather say , ' What problem ? ' &quot; Eventually , though , Beck says he found an oil_company that put about $ 50 # 000 into his research program . ( Beck says a secrecy agreement prevents him from identifying the company. ) He put another $ 20 # 000 of_his_own money into it . The results were encouraging , Beck says . During one experiment he managed to create a 500-pound &quot; oilberg , &quot; demonstrating the feasibility of the process on bigger-than-a-mudpuddle spills . He also managed to come_up with another application for his dry-ice theories : firefighting . Beck figured that shooting dry_ice pellets into an enclosed room would quickly &quot; supercool &quot; the temperature , thus quashing the fire . And since dry_ice evaporates into a gas , rather than melting into water , it would prevent water damage in library fires , museum fires -- any fires where water is almost as dangerous as the fire itself . Earlier this month Beck and Pat Smith , his partner in the project , staged a demonstration of both dry_ice applications -- oil freezing and firefighting -- at the Manhattan Beach Fire_Department . While firefighters and an oil spill specialist for Chevron looked_on , Beck used a converted leaf-blower -- he calls it a cryoblaster -- to shoot dry_ice pellets onto a tub full of oil . Then he used a converted fire_extinguisher to shoot dry_ice pellets onto a fire in a can . The results ? The oil froze , and the fire went_out . One of Beck ' s former UCLA professors , who was there to lend moral support , was encouraging . &quot; I think it has real possibilities , &quot; said chemistry professor Mario Baur . &quot; This is so_much better ( for oil spill cleanup ) than anything we have so far . It has a lot of potential in certain situations. &quot; Not everyone was completely convinced , however . &quot; I ' m not saying anything bad about the idea , &quot; Stu Hackney , an oil spill coordinator for Chevron in El Segundo , said later . &quot; It might work in calm water , around piers and that kind of thing. &quot; But Hackney doubts it would be practical in open water , where wave action could disperse frozen oil just as it does unfrozen oil . As for fighting fires with dry_ice , Manhattan Beach Fire_Marshal Steven Age predicted , &quot; It ' s going_to take a little more work. &quot; But Beck is undeterred . &quot; All we need now is corporate support and financing , &quot; he says . &quot; Our only problem is money. &quot; He doesn ' t want the money for himself , he says , but for the research . In fact , he hasn ' t even patented the dry-ice process . &quot; All patents do is give you the right to sue people , &quot; Beck says . &quot; We ' re looking_for ways to protect the environment. &quot; Besides , he adds with a laugh , &quot; We inventors always die poor. &quot; So who knows ? Maybe someday Tim Beck will be to oil spills what Thomas_Edison was to the kerosene_lamp -- the guy who will put them out of business . And even if that doesn ' t work_out , he has other ideas . Right now , for example , he has an idea for taming hurricanes by cooling_down the sea water they move_over . See , first you dump a bunch of dry_ice into the water from submarines . . .</TEXT>
