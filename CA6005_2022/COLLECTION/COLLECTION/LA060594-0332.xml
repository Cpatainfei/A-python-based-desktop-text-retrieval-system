   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; THE SOLE OF THE MATTER ; TWO DISPARATE VIEWS ON THE WORLD ' S MOST POPULAR SPORT AND ITS PLACE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY ; AMERICANS DON ' T SO_MUCH DISLIKE SOCCER AS THEY ARE SIMPLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The oldest and most prolific soccer franchise in the United States is practicing on a tennis_court . Carpet covers the asphalt . Wooden boards surround the baselines . The San Diego Sockers are young and shaggy-haired and laugh easily as soccer_balls leave their feet and clang into one of the goals . Clang , because the goal is a chain-link fence . Later , they will walk past courts still used for tennis , lock their cars and leave the neighborhood as prostitutes are arriving . The Sockers have won 10 professional indoor soccer championships in 13 years , yet their British coach still fights the urge to give_up . &quot; There are times I think , ' Did I do the right thing by remaining in the United States ? ' &quot; says Ron Newman , who has pushed his sport here for 26 years . &quot; I tell my friends the horror stories about soccer , and they all say , ' Why on earth do you stay ? ' &quot; Why , indeed ? Despite a 20-year infusion of players , fields , leagues and knee socks with tassels , there is a truth in this country as it prepares to play host to the most important soccer event in the world : We do not give_a_hoot about soccer . Statistics show that our children play it more_than they play baseball . Our colleges have more soccer teams than football_teams . Yet we do not watch it . Not on television , not in_person and certainly not where the purchase of a ticket is required . Does Ron Newman ever have horror stories . Ten years ago , his Sockers averaged 11 # 415 fans for 16 games at the 12 # 948-capacity Sports Arena . Since then , they have : -- Lost their longtime owner . -- Lost their league . -- Lost the roof over their heads . Only in soccer , only in America , could an indoor dynasty have to practice outside . The once-proud North_American Soccer League of the 1970s has been moved inside and eventually whittled into the Continental Indoor Soccer League , of which the Sockers are members and play in front of an average of 5 # 500 fans . &quot; We have just not created enough excitement for the game here , &quot; Newman said . &quot; People say , ' Why should I watch ? ' &quot; People say worse than that . A Harris Poll conducted in February showed that only 20 % of Americans realized that the World Cup will be held_in this country this summer . Only 25 % of Americans even know that the World Cup involves soccer . And more_than half , 53 % , said they are not interested in watching any of the games on television . And this is the most-watched sporting event on the globe . Pollsters did not ask the respondents for their reasons . But here are a_few ideas . WHAT DO YOU MEAN , WE can ' t USE OUR HANDS ? For those casual observers who think the corner_kick is a country-western dance , the game plays like a strange foreign film . Players penalized for touching the ball with their hands ? Players applauded for hitting the ball with their head ? Players who , upon being lightly bumped , fall to the ground in a sobbing heap ? &quot; Soccer feels_like it belongs_to another culture , &quot; said Eric Denson , sports psychologist at the University of Delaware . &quot; Baseball is our national pastime , everything about football is very American and basketball is our urban phenomenon . I don ' t know where soccer fits_in that mix. &quot; THIS WEEK ON TELEVISION : 40 EPISODES OF MATLOCK , NO SOCCER . Remember those sweet old days when the most commonly repeated adage in sports was , &quot; May the best_man win ? &quot; Today , it ' s , &quot; Without television , you ' re meat. &quot; No spectator sport can survive without a television contract . If you don ' t believe that , there are United States Football_League tickets to sell you . Soccer is without a major television contract because network executives are convinced nobody will watch it . Soccer fans claim nobody can watch it because it is seldom on television . Undisputed is that in 1990 , the World Cup telecasts from Italy averaged only a 1.2 rating on the TNT cable network . That translates to 571 # 000 cable households , less than half the average ratings drawn by bowling , boxing or the New York Marathon . &quot; It is not the ideal game for television , &quot; said Kevin O ' Malley , TNT senior_vice_president for programming . &quot; The pacing of the game , the size of the field , the subtleties of the game , all_of that makes_it difficult. &quot; It doesn ' t help that there are no home_runs , touchdown catches or bench-clearing brawls . &quot; We are a microwave popcorn culture . We don ' t want to wait long for action , &quot; said Joel Cohen , a Los Angeles human relations specialist who wrote a master ' s thesis for Boston University on the future of soccer in America . &quot; But soccer takes time to develop . We don ' t have the attention_span for it. &quot; Of course , none of those theories accounts_for the real reason Americans can ' t sit and watch a 90-minute soccer games . There are no timeouts . When are we going_to go_to the bathroom ? Or the fridge ? EXCUSE ME , BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THE LAST 90 MINUTES ? Arguably , the most sensuous of all English verbs in the United States is score . You score tickets to a concert . You scored big with the boss by staying late to finish that project . And what would teen-ager movies be without somebody bragging to somebody else about , well , you know . Recently , the NFL changed rules that have been around for 75 years . Reason ? To increase scoring . People are still writing bad jokes about the 1990 World Cup in Italy . Reason ? The teams averaged 2.2 goals a game . Combined . &quot; All Americans want is scoring , while Europeans only care about the final result , &quot; Newman said . &quot; For Americans , points ( are ) entertainment . Europeans couldn ' t even tell you the final score . . . but they know who won. &quot; It might help if , every time a soccer player scored , he didn ' t scream at the clouds and fall to his knees and act_as if this was the last goal we would see this century . WE ' D LEAP FROM WINDOW AFTER A LOSS ONLY IF PUSHED Soccer ' s biggest asset is not its strategy or its athleticism , but its passion . There are few press_boxes in European stadiums , by request of the reporters . To cover a soccer game there is to sit in the stands and cover the singing , weeping , flag-waving and fistfighting . That doesn ' t quite describe your typical Dodger fan . &quot; I just watched the Knicks beat the Bulls in their final playoff_game , and it was an intense game , &quot; said Kyle Rote Jr. , the first American soccer player to gain renown here . &quot; But there were not any suicides in Chicago the next day , and the Chicago mayor was still in office . People simply turned their attention to the White Sox and the Cubs. &quot; In other countries , soccer is the sport . If the national team loses , there could be a coup . Not containing the flash of other sports , soccer requires this passion to survive . Newman said it can be developed here only when that boy down the street grows_up to be a pro soccer player , and the entire neighborhood becomes his fan . Soccer needs people , not cheering for a sport , but for other people . &quot; When my wife was coaching youth soccer in Dallas , there was a father who would n ' t stay for the games because he didn ' t understand them , &quot; Newman recalled . &quot; But after a_few weeks , when he realized he was missing a part of his son ' s life , he started staying longer and longer . &quot; By the end of the season , he still didn ' t know much about soccer , but I caught him fighting another parent in a ditch. &quot; INK-STAINED WRETCHES WOULD RATHER PICK_UP A CHECK THAN WRITE ABOUT SOCCER It is the soccer family ' s belief that opinion makers in this country hate the sport . They believe the media either rip it or ignore it , without ever understanding it . &quot; You show me a sports editor of a major newspaper in this country who likes soccer , and I will show you a miracle , &quot; Newman said . Upon hearing this comment , George Solomon made the earth move . &quot; I like soccer , &quot; said Solomon , assistant managing editor , sports , for the Washington Post . &quot; If you look_back at how the NASL was covered , it was covered well . On a number of occasions -- the Washington Diplomats were here -- we led the newspaper with it . A well-conceived outdoor league would generate coverage and interest. &quot; Soccer fans complain that even when columnists write_about their sport , they trash it . &quot; That really annoys me , &quot; said Glenn Dickey , longtime sports columnist of the San Francisco Chronicle and former soccer beat reporter . &quot; Very few sportswriters understand soccer at all , but rather than make an attempt to learn , they just dismiss it as stupid because nobody scores . &quot; If a guy doesn ' t know about a sport , don ' t write_about it . I don ' t. &quot; Bob Smizik , sports columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , was recently embroiled in local controversy when he ripped the sport . And his son plays it . &quot; It ' s very boring . I can ' t get excited even at my kid ' s soccer game , &quot; Smizik said . &quot; There is a lack of scoring . A lack of understanding about the rules . &quot; Violence in sports turns me off , but it turns most Americans on . . . and soccer is not violent enough . It ' s too clean. &quot; Even in Pennsylvania , one of the top soccer-playing states , Smizik is not alone . When the fledgling Major Soccer League began campaigning in Pittsburgh for $ 50 ticket pledges in hopes of bringing a franchise there , a local television_reporter offered to pay people not to buy the tickets . &quot; Under no circumstances does this guy want a soccer team in this town , &quot; Smizik said . IMAGINE BASKETBALL IN A COUNTRY WITH NO FULL COURTS Newman remembers walking into Balboa Stadium in San Diego during renovations and noticing long-jump pits being put_on the sidelines . &quot; I rushed home and wrote the city a letter , asking them to please put the long_jump pits in the end zones so the field could remain wide enough for soccer , &quot; Newman recalled . &quot; I got a letter back from an official who wrote that he would not change anything because he was trying to make the field suitable for all sports. &quot; Newman sighed and said : &quot; But wasn ' t that my point ? &quot; Appropriately , one of the best soccer stadiums in the country is one that has been deserted by a football_team -- the facility at Cal State Fullerton . Rare is the field built just for soccer . Fields that could attract professional outdoor teams are built for football . Most new recreational fields are built for softball . For those wishing to watch good soccer , neither works . Football_fields are too narrow . An official football_field is 53.3 yards wide . A proper soccer field should be at least 70 yards wide . &quot; So the soccer that many Americans see is like soccer being played in an alley , &quot; Newman said . &quot; That makes_it easy for the defense . Fewer goals are scored , leading to all_the complaints about no scoring. &quot; Softball fields have pitching mounds and dirt , both of which hurt soccer players more_than other sports . &quot; The trend today is to just put a soccer field in the middle of softball fields , &quot; said Mona Nahimy , recreation specialist for the city of San Diego . &quot; Many people play soccer , but many people also play softball . And baseball is still our national sport. &quot; THE GRANDFATHER FACTOR Many children have learned about baseball from older relatives who have taken them to games and explained the nuances . When a grandfather and his grandchild attend a soccer game -- if ever -- the child does the explaining . &quot; It is hard to spread the beauty of the sport when there are generations of people over 30 who do not understand it , &quot; said Rote , now a sports agent . &quot; I take my son to a baseball_game , I can explain about cutoff throws . The more he appreciates the game , the more he loves to watch it . &quot; For many parents and grandparents , that cannot happen in soccer . And it won ' t happen until today ' s younger soccer players grow up. &quot; Rote hopes to serve as a surrogate grandfather at the Rose Bowl later this summer when he coaches the contestants in the Gillette Free_Kick Challenge . In the contest , a person can win $ 1 million for kicking a ball into a four-foot space from 15 yards away . &quot; I will teach this person about kicking from the inside of the foot , and outside of the foot , and off the shoelaces , &quot; Rote said . &quot; It will be a great chance to school someone on the nuances of the game. &quot; And if the contestant is American , he will probably figure_out a way to throw it in .</TEXT>
