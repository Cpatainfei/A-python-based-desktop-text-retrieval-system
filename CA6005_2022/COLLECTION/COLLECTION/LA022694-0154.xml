   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; BACK HOME , THEY CAN ONLY LISTEN AND WAIT ; REACTION : SUPPORTERS OF KERRIGAN AND HARDING TAKE THE NEWS FROM NORWAY WITH CHINS_UP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Portland , Ore. , the Olympic figure_skating competition competed on radio talk_shows with listeners seemingly more angered over the Trail Blazers ' inability to trade for Danny Manning than over the failure of Tonya Harding to live_up_to her Olympic boast of a gold medal . At the Clackamas Town Center in Portland , where a Tonya Harding sign hangs over her home rink , the noontime crowd of skaters -- most of them youngsters -- appeared largely oblivious to the fact that Harding was performing at that very moment thousands of miles away . There were few radios among the shoppers who gathered around the ice_rink to watch the skaters . One of the few people monitoring the figure_skating results was Judi Galusha , 38 , of nearby Milaukie , Ore. , who spun_around the ice with her two children while listening to her radio with headphones . When she heard that Oksana Baiul of Ukraine had won the competition , she smiled . &quot; I was hoping that somebody else would win , and not Nancy ( Kerrigan ) or Tonya , &quot; she said . &quot; I thought there was too_much attention placed on them , so I wasn ' t rooting for either one of them. &quot; Barbara McKeever , 40 , of Sandy , Ore. , had rushed to the rink to hear the results and was pleased when she learned that the Ukrainian had won the gold although she said she had been hoping for a Kerrigan victory . &quot; I thought there was too_much controversy made_over Kerrigan and Harding at the Olympics . It would have been nice for Nancy to win , but I think the outcome was great , &quot; McKeever said . But 11-year-old Nicole Green wore a pink button on her T-shirt saying &quot; We believe_in Tonya &quot; as she skated at the Clackamas rink . When she learned that her hometown favorite had failed to win a medal , she was clearly downcast and said she and her friends had watched Harding practice for the Olympics . &quot; I still think she ' s wonderful , &quot; she said . Among those who did not seem outwardly concerned about the goings-on in Lillehammer was a vendor whose cart featured small &quot; Tonya Going_for Gold &quot; prints -- at $ 6 and $ 12 each -- near the ice_rink . Who was she rooting for in the final program ? &quot; I don ' t want to say , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want to offend any customers. &quot; VICTOR MERINA</TEXT>
