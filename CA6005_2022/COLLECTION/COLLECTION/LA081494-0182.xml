   <TEXT> What ' s black and gay and playing_on stages all_over ? The Pomo Afro Homos , of course . that ' s short for Postmodern African-American Homosexuals -- a group of funny guys from San Francisco who , in less than four years , have gone from tiny Bay Area alternative spaces like Josie ' s Cabaret to major venues such_as New York ' s Lincoln Center . They make dramatic and satiric sketches about racism , homophobia and black gay life . Whether taking_aim at the_likes_of super-swishy &quot; In Living Color &quot; film critics Blaine and Antoine , or traditional psychotherapy , or telling poignant coming-of-age tales , the Pomo Afro Homos confront tough questions with candor and style . The group may_not be a household name yet , but it ' s as hot as its targets are provocative . They ' ll bring &quot; More Fabulous Fun Stories , &quot; an evening of trademark irreverence in a mixed comic-serious format , to Santa Monica on Aug . 18-21 , as part of Highway ' s sixth annual festival of gay and lesbian performance and visual art . It ' s just one whirl on a full dance card . Though one might expect Pomo Afro Homos ' sensitive and difficult subject_matter to create a booking nightmare , they ' ve been much in_demand lately . The young troupe has also been racking_up the honors , including the prestigious Bessie Award , and been well-received in increasingly visible places . Last December , the Pomo Afro Homos -- founding members Brian Freeman , Eric Gupton , Djola Bernard Branner and additional performers -- appeared on Comedy Central ' s &quot; Out There , &quot; the cable channel ' s gay and lesbian comedy special . More recently , the group took_the_stage at New York ' s Lincoln Center for their second year in a row as part of the Serious Fun ! festival . They have toured their shows &quot; Fierce Love &quot; and &quot; Dark Fruit &quot; throughout the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom . And the Pomos , as they ' re affectionately called , also continue to play the smaller spots where they first honed their brazen satire . Perhaps the only downside to the group ' s rapid rise is that it indicates there remains a need for their critique . Racism and homophobia -- the great Pomo no-nos -- do persist , and not just in mainstream heterosexual culture . They are , as the Pomos illustrate , present in the gay and African-American communities as well . &quot; Their work is important because they ' re telling vital black_men ' s stories , &quot; says writer-performer Keith Antar Mason of the Hittite Empire , a Los Angeles-based all-male African American performance-art collective which performed on a London bill with the Pomo Afro Homos in October , 1993 . &quot; Homophobia in the black community is very real . ( The Pomos ) deal with silence , violence and AIDS , as we do , and they are great storytellers and great craftsmen . They should be heard. &quot; Gupton , speaking by phone from Atlanta where the group recently was performing at the National Black_Arts Festival , says , &quot; Racism is never a fun topic . There ' s no easy way to talk_about homophobia . Some people just can ' t take this stuff straight . Humor has always been a good way to talk_about things that are difficult. &quot; But once the resistance begins to crumble , the Pomos leave their mark . &quot; There are usually people who are blown away that there is a reflection of their lives onstage , &quot; says Gupton . &quot; Black gay people are not going_away . And younger people should not have to throw themselves off the balconies of hotel_rooms or murder themselves because they don ' t see their reflection anywhere. &quot; The Pomos , who range_in age from mid- to late-30s , first got_together as a group in the Bay Area in November , 1990 . Culturally speaking , it was just the right moment . &quot; At that moment in time , it was a critical intersection , &quot; says Freeman , who had previously spent eight years performing with the San Francisco Mime Troupe . &quot; There had been this rush of films -- ' Paris Is Burning , ' ' Tongues Untied ' and ' Truth or Dare ' ( which deal with black gay life ) in a very awkward , manipulative way -- and books about black gay writing , like ' Brother to Brother , ' had come out. &quot; I t wasn ' t just coincidence that Freeman , Branner and Gupton took_up the subject of black gay identity . &quot; We knew a lot of these other people doing this work , &quot; continues Freeman , who worked_on the Marlon Riggs film &quot; Tongues Untied , &quot; which sparked a backlash from the political and religious right because the documentary on gay black_men received some funding from the National Endowment for the Arts . &quot; Many of them were part of a group called Black Gay United in San Francisco . It ' s a very small network of people around the country doing this work , primarily writers but also artists. &quot; There were other reasons why this surge of artistic activity took_place at this particular time . &quot; It was about the gay and lesbian community entering its third decade ( of having a high public profile ) . . . and people feeling frustrated that there was no space for black gay and lesbians , &quot; says Freeman , who , like Gupton , is originally from Massachusetts . &quot; People were working for AIDS organizations and trying to bring it back home , wanting to be ' out ' in the context of the black community . It was time for there to be an ' out ' black gay and lesbian community. &quot; Since 1990 , the Pomo roster has varied a bit . Gupton took a brief sabbatical at one point and was replaced by Marvin White . Branner has also gone_on and off the list , and will leave again this fall when he moves to Minneapolis . The group also includes White , Tony Stovalli and sometimes drag diva Joan Jett Blakk . No matter what the lineup , the performers share a sensibility . Combining an emphasis on theatrical craftsmanship with humor and pathos , they offer stylish political theater -- only without the pedantry that term usually implies . In one &quot; Dark Fruit &quot; spoof called &quot; Black and Gay : A Psycho-Sex Study , &quot; the Pomos spin_off the pulp novel genre with a &quot; psycho-sexologist &quot; scientist and the discovery that , yes , there is racism in the gay world . In the &quot; Fierce Love &quot; sketch &quot; Good Hands , &quot; they show what happens when two men attempt to have_sex in a back_room that ' s not really set_up for that particular activity . There are also autobiographical monologues in the Pomos ' shows -- including Branner ' s &quot; Sweet Sadie &quot; and Freeman ' s &quot; Doin ' Alright &quot; -- and pointedly topical forays . In a &quot; Dark Fruit &quot; episode called &quot; Tasty , &quot; for instance , Gupton appears as a naive office temp who suffers the slings and arrows of sexual_harassment . Although the overall tone of a Pomos evening is humorous , there ' s more to it than comedy . &quot; Sometimes we ' re satirists and sometimes we ' re just real , &quot; says Freeman . &quot; The comedy thing can be a bit of a burden . Some stuff just doesn ' t want that kind of treatment . Whether it comes_in a funny way or just comes , we just want to spit it out. &quot; The common thread isn ' t style but subject . &quot; We all stand to learn from having a conversation about what it is to be black and gay , &quot; says Gupton . &quot; We spent so_much time identifying our differences that the work ends_up illustrating the basic desires to have shelter , sense of community and to live_in this world unharmed . People feel that to talk_about common struggle isolates , but for me it seems to be a matter of cooperative venture. &quot; T he challenging nature of the material is also a tribute to the Pomos ' high opinion of its audience . &quot; We dared to push ahead , &quot; says Freeman . &quot; If we ' re doing a coming-out story , we approach it by assuming it ' s not the first African-American coming-out story everyone ' s ever heard . We assume people have been around , and they have . We opt_for a higher consciousness. &quot; Could success change them into so-so Pomos ? Maybe , if they ' re not careful . Freeman says the group hasn ' t tailored its material to suit the mainstream . They prefer to raise audiences to their level instead . &quot; We are real community-based artists , &quot; says Freeman . &quot; When we ' re performing , it ' s about trying to evoke a sense of community . Trying to do that in ( Lincoln Center ' s ) Alice Tully Hall is challenging to say the least. &quot; The biggest change is that they ' re not performing for a tight-knit group of fellow_travelers anymore . &quot; We were playing to a mostly black gay audience at first , &quot; says Gupton . &quot; Now we have families and little old_ladies from established parts of town coming_to see us , which is a wonderful surprise. &quot; &quot; When we started , I could count_on knowing half the people in the audience , &quot; adds Freeman . &quot; I could throw stuff in , like personal jokes . At Lincoln Center , I hardly knew a soul . It was a very black audience , but these were not the people I had seen around the community_centers . It had moved beyond that core activist audience. &quot; Of course , there are other perks as well . &quot; At first , it was intimidating , &quot; Branner says . of the move from small houses to large . &quot; Then I found that I really like the space , being allowed to be that big . Also , it creates a space for other black gay performers and a black gay audience . It expands community in a different way. &quot; Yet even if the Pomos don ' t feel pressured to change for their audiences , they may evolve for themselves . &quot; Our first show , ' Fierce Love , ' was about identities -- that ' s plural because we do have different identities , &quot; says Branner . &quot; Then we started trying to outline some of the problems that kept us from relating to larger communities , like the larger gay and black communities , and even how we relate interracially . &quot; We began this venture as an effort to portray the lives of black gay_men because we had not seen those images either in theater or film or television , &quot; says Branner , who grew_up in South Central L.A. and performs a monologue in &quot; Dark Fruit &quot; that is partly based on that experience . &quot; We were certainly targeting a black gay audience . But by looking_at our lives within this microcosm we created stories that had universal resonance and we discovered that our lives were as mundane as everybody else ' s. &quot; There has been a lot of water under the bridge since 1990 , and the Pomos feel a need to move_on . For Freeman , it ' s a matter of changing topics . &quot; Can I allow myself to move away from the question of identity and trust that these things will be implicit_in the work and that the audience will want to make that journey with me ? &quot; he says . Yet for Branner , who will leave the group when he moves to Minneapolis this fall , a bigger shift is needed . &quot; Personally , I ' m at a point where my black gay identity is not the primary orientation of my work , &quot; he says . &quot; Marlon Riggs and other black gay performance artists have given the community a larger visibility and people have been allowed to look_at our identities more . The discussion has begun . At least people are educated enough to know that racism exists within the gay community and that we need to talk_about it. &quot; that ' s partly thanks to the black gay artists themselves , and to the warm reception that the Pomos have been given by crossover audiences . &quot; It ' s important for people to understand the community that black gay_men are trying to develop , &quot; says Gupton . &quot; I strongly believe now that there is a forum for other black gay groups to empower themselves . We can do what we do for each other and , at_the_same_time , create the space for other black lesbian and gay performers. &quot; Black gay culture is evident elsewhere as well . &quot; Especially in Los Angeles , for example , there are a number of black gay organizations now , &quot; says Freeman . &quot; When we were there in 1991 , there were maybe two or three . Also , there are at least four or five ' zines now , where in ' 91 there was one . And some of the other gay magazines will actually run an article or a photo of someone who is not white and totally over muscle-bound once in a while. &quot; Ironically , one of the last bas tions of resistance may be the culturally specific arts . &quot; If you look_at African American arts across the country , there are so few ' out ' gay artists , even in the dance world , &quot; says Freeman . &quot; But if we try and actually name a black choreographer who ' s heterosexual , we ' re gonna be thinking for a while. &quot; The National Black_Arts Festival in Atlanta , where the group performed prior to Los Angeles , was been one of those places where the Pomos felt their candor wasn ' t quite welcome -- until this year , that is . This is the first year the group was invited to perform . &quot; For us , it ' s a big telegram that said , ' Welcome home , ' &quot; says Freeman . &quot; Other gay artists have been in the festival , but there ' s no hiding us . It ' s right there in the name . Clearly , they got the message . The inclusion is great and it ' s not tokenistic. &quot; Constant self-examination keeps the Pomos on their toes . The group also shares an activist bent with other black gay artists such_as dance-theater choreographer David Rousseve . &quot; that ' s what ' s great about the African American performing arts community now , &quot; says the Hittites ' Mason . &quot; We ' re not just dealing with identity issues . We ' re dealing with the whole person and ( the Pomo Afro Homos ) help make that possible . People in_general are more able to deal with black_men ' s humanity. &quot; And that humanity is as various as that of any group . &quot; As we announce so clearly in our show ( s ) , these are just some of the stories , &quot; says Gupton . &quot; We merely present the mirror , the community at_large with all its flaws . What it should do is empower people to say you have value in your life . It may_not be reflected in a sitcom , but you should honor it. &quot; Which is why artists such_as Gupton , Freeman and Branner continue to challenge themselves , even in the face of impressive success . &quot; I ' m trying to think in different ways about what it is that we do , &quot; says Freeman . &quot; We were inventing the whole_thing three years ago all at once . Now it ' s ( about ) trusting that there is a hunger out there that there will be an audience for the work. &quot; * Vital Stats &quot; More Fabulous Fun Stories &quot; Address : Highways , 1651 18th St. , Santa Monica Price : $ 12- $ 15 .
