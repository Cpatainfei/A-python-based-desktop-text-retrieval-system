   <HEADLINE> ROLLER DERBY ; SMALL STORES SCRAMBLE FOR IN-LINE SKATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dave White is in the seemingly fortunate position of owning a skate shop in the middle of the biggest boom the in-line skate industry has ever seen . But that blessing became a curse a_few months ago when demand for the skates exploded and supplies dried_up . In late spring , when White tried to order more Rollerblade skates -- the most popular in-line brand -- the company said it would not be filling any new orders until 1995 . &quot; If I could be able to order skates and get them within a week or two , I could sell 10 to 20 pairs a week , &quot; White said . &quot; But now I can ' t sell any . I don ' t have what people are looking for. &quot; Instead , he is losing customers to sporting goods giants such_as Oshman ' s Sporting Goods , Sports Chalet and Big 5 Sporting Goods -- chain_stores that pre-ordered thousands of pairs of the skates and have continued to receive shipments while shelves in smaller stores stay empty . &quot; Big companies can afford to pre-order hundreds or even thousands of skates , &quot; White said . &quot; I ' m a small shop , and I can only order two or three pairs at a time . Smaller skate shops have been shut out. &quot; Indeed , at Sportmart in West Los Angeles , the store is overflowing with in-line skates . &quot; We got too many ( darn ) Rollerblades , &quot; said Tony Bell , an assistant manager . &quot; We ' ve been choking them up . Our buyers tend to buy and ship as_many as they can. &quot; * The discrepancy is the unintended consequence of a record sales year for in-line skate manufacturers , who woefully underestimated consumer demand for the 1994 season after coming_off a relatively flat year . &quot; Demand is outstripping capacity between three and six months , &quot; said Pierre Boivin , president of Canstar , which makes Bauer in-line skates . &quot; It ' s an industrywide problem. &quot; Although revenue climbed 13 % to $ 243 million in 1993 from $ 215 million in 1992 , the number of skates sold grew only about 4 % , according to statistics from the National Sporting Goods Assn . in Mt . Prospect , Ill . But things turned_around quickly this year . In the first_quarter alone , 1.8 million pairs of skates were sold -- nearly double the 1 million pairs sold in last year ' s first_quarter , said Henry Zuver , executive_director of the International In-Line Skating Assn. , a trade group in Atlanta . Sales are expected to reach $ 325 million by the end of December , traditionally the biggest month for the industry , said Thomas Doyle , research_director of the national sporting goods association . &quot; No one predicted that we would have this level of growth , &quot; said Deborah Autrey , a spokeswoman for Rollerblade in Minneapolis , where extra shifts of workers are churning_out skates as fast as they can . &quot; There ' s only so_much capacity in our manufacturing facilities , and it just takes time to fill orders. &quot; Skate manufacturers and retailers are at_a_loss to explain the unexpected boom in skate sales , but many cite the introduction this spring of skates with more advanced braking_systems that make_it easier for skaters to stop . Other explanations include the proliferation of roller hockey_leagues , the Winter_Olympics -- which featured athletes who train using in-line skates -- and good_weather . Whatever the cause , specialty skate shops -- which sell 15 % of all in-line skates and often concentrate_on stocking high-end blades for the skating connoisseur -- are suffering . &quot; It ' s costing me about 20 sales a day , &quot; said Phyllis Fleschler , owner of Valley Skate &amp; Surf in North Hills . &quot; We ' ve had lists of people ( waiting to buy in-line skates ) . As a matter_of_fact , the oldest one on the list is from March. &quot; Unbelieving customers roam from store to store , often in a hopeless search for their first-choice pair of skates , said Patrick Lochouarn , owner of Venice Rollerworks . &quot; After going_to six or seven stores , they realize &quot; the skates aren ' t available , he said . Mark Pierre said he is asking around at hockey rinks and scouring the Trading Times in search of a new pair of in-line roller hockey skates . In addition to being unable to place orders , stores report that they are not receiving full shipment on their pre-ordered skates . Shipments to Fleschler ' s store have been down 25 % since the shortage began . Lochouarn got only a third of the Rollerblades he ordered in his August shipment and has scratched off his booking orders skates he is sure will not be delivered . * &quot; I ' m glad I ' m not a small specialty_store , &quot; said Ric Miranda , a buyer for Sandy ' s Ski &amp; Sport , a three-store chain that has seen sales of in-line skates grow from a quarter to half its business in one year . &quot; It ' s a Catch-22 for the little guy , because once the big company makes a big commitment , the little guy doesn ' t have a chance to go_back and order more , &quot; Miranda said . &quot; But they can ' t cancel orders , &quot; so they have to buy conservatively , he added . But that , said Zuver of the in-line skate association , is &quot; just business. &quot; &quot; If you ' ve got a chain_store buying 100 # 000 units and a small store buying 100 units , the large store is certainly going_to have more flexibility , &quot; Zuver said . Still , he added , &quot; most skate companies have been in business long enough to know that specialty shops are very important to them , and they don ' t want to step_on their toes either. &quot; On a Roll The number of in-line rollerskaters has increased fourfold since 1990...
