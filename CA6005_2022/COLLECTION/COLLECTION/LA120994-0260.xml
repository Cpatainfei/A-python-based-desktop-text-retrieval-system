   <TEXT> Among its many provisions to discourage illegal immigration , Proposition 187 included what its sponsors have billed as tough new sanctions against the manufacture and use of fraudulent citizenship documents . However , as the first_person charged under the initiative was ordered to stand trial Thursday , law_enforcement officials say the ballot measure ' s wording leaves it doubtful whether many lawbreakers will receive stiffer penalties than in the past . Proposition 187 calls_for a sentence of five years in state_prison or a fine of $ 75 # 000 for manufacturing , distributing or selling false documents . But because crimes punishable by fines can normally be treated as either felonies or misdemeanors , the authors of Proposition 187 appear to have given judges and prosecutors the leeway to provide misdemeanor sentences -- which carry a maximum one-year county jail term -- as well as five-year sentences , according to the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . &quot; It ' s clear ( the initiative ' s sponsors ) wanted this to be a straight felony , but when they put_in a fine , they really complicated ( things ) , &quot; said Los Angeles County Assistant Dist . Atty . Frank Sundstedt . In the cases filed last week under the fraudulent documents section -- the only key provision of Proposition 187 not now blocked from taking_effect by state and federal judges -- the district_attorney ' s office charged three Huntington Park-area men with felonies . And after a three-hour preliminary hearing Thursday afternoon , the first of the Proposition 187 defendants , Jose Hernandez Sanchez , 24 , was ordered to stand trial by a South Gate Municipal Court judge on felony charges of manufacturing fake citizenship documents and additional charges of forgery and possessing cocaine for_sale . Two alleged accomplices , who were also arrested at a motel_room where authorities found several sheets of unfinished fake Social_Security cards , were held_over for trial on non-Proposition 187 forgery charges . The prosecutor ' s office will continue to file all future Proposition 187 cases as felonies , according to office policy guidelines issued in late November . However , in many cases , defendants will probably receive a_few months in jail , Sundstedt said . &quot; It would be foolish to say we ' d urge the court in all circumstances to impose five years in prison without analyzing the previous criminal history of the defendant and the facts of the case , &quot; Sundstedt said . Many first-time offenders in Los Angeles charged with nonviolent crimes receive sentences of about six months in County Jail and face three additional years in state_prison if they violate the terms of their probation , county prosecutors said . Before Proposition 187 became law , manufacturers of fake citizenship documents faced_up to three years in prison under the state ' s forgery statute . But when charged with multiple counts for each fake document , they faced maximum sentences of more_than six years in prison . Proposition 187 , on the other hand , calls_for punishment of five years in state_prison no matter how many documents are printed or sold . Another point that Proposition 187 does not directly address is the possession of fake citizenship documents , said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block , who opposed the initiative during the election campaign , in part because he believed it was poorly written . The sheriff said that , based on the measure ' s wording , &quot; you must use that document &quot; to be arrested . Proposition 187 campaign head Ron Prince , who takes credit for writing the sections on fraudulent documents , disagrees_with the interpretations by Los Angeles law_enforcement officials . Prince said the initiative clearly states that those manufacturing false documents are &quot; guilty of a felony. &quot; &quot; There ' s no way anyone could possibly construe that as being unclear , &quot; Prince said . &quot; If anyone in law_enforcement needs a clarification of the word felony , perhaps we should reconsider the way in which our law_enforcement personnel are trained. &quot; Prince also contends that illegal immigrants carrying fake identifications are subject_to prosecution -- despite the fact the word possession was not included in the ballot measure . &quot; I am sorry , &quot; he said . &quot; But if they are in possession of a fraudulent green_card , they ' ve committed a felony in the state of California , and we expect the law will be enforced. &quot;</TEXT>
