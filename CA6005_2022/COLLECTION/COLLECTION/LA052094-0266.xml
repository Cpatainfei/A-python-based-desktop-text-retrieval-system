   <HEADLINE> THEATER BEAT : FANTASY , NIGHTMARE MIX IN ' RIFFS &amp; CREDOS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> J.M. Barrie called death &quot; an awfully big adventure. &quot; In &quot; Riffs &amp; Credos &quot; at Playwrights ' Arena , Gene , a Catholic priest dying of AIDS , is embarked_on the ultimate Outward Bound trip . Deep in a coma , he drifts in a hallucinatory dream . Gene doesn ' t question the concept of a hereafter . It ' s just that he hasn ' t quite figured_out whether he ' s climbing Jacob ' s ladder or descending Joseph ' s well . Despite all his agonized prayers and musings , he ' s lost due_North . Nick Salamone ' s &quot; Riffs &amp; Credos &quot; is the stuff of fantasy and nightmare . A sequel to his earlier work , &quot; All Soul ' s Day , &quot; the play is a vividly dramatic re-creation of one man ' s final moments . The priest , Gene ( Steve Tschudy ) , a practicing homosexual until the time of his ordination , has stringently kept his priestly vow of celibacy , but the cost to his psyche -- not to mention his friends -- has been dear . Gene ' s former lover Sunny ( Salamone ) , himself an AIDS sufferer , is a tenacious disbeliever who remains defiantly carnal as he faces his own end . Val ( Jon Powell ) , Gene ' s sometime lover turned platonic companion , is as repressed as he is cerebral . Jan ( Elizabeth O ' Connell ) , Gene ' s longtime gal pal , nurses a subterranean passion for the priest . The ensemble brings a sense of urgency and mission to the play , which is sensitively directed by Jessica Kubzansky . In Jim Byrkit ' s scenic design , the white-swathed stage becomes the penumbra of light into which Gene will shortly journey . Itself a big adventure , &quot; Riffs &amp; Credos &quot; is an authoritative glimpse of the unknowable . * &quot; Riffs &amp; Credos , &quot; Playwrights ' Arena , 5262 Pico Blvd. , Los Angeles . Thursdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. Ends June 11 . $ 12 . ( 213 ) 466-1767 . Running time : 1 hour , 25 minutes . ' Life After Birth ? ' Is Long on Laughs * Walter feels displaced , insecure . Perhaps it was all those years of being called &quot; butt-head &quot; by his bratty brother . Or maybe he shouldn ' t have adopted the Cleaver family as role_models . Kathleen feels ugly , unlovable . Raised in the shadow of her sexpot sister , she still imagines herself the archetypal dweeb , complete with braces , glasses and dowdy band uniform . Naturally , these two were made_for each other . &quot; Is There Life After Birth ? , &quot; now at the Tamarind , is a wacky boy-meets-girl comedy that is long on laughs , though sometimes short on substance . Playwright Jeffrey Alan Arbaugh , who also plays Walter , borrows a bit from Woody Allen , a bit more from Robin Williams , throws_in a selection of vintage television snippets , then melds all into his own distinctively manic style . Director Don Most ' s sure sense of comic timing complements Arbaugh ' s humor throughout , as does Ken Radcliffe ' s witty sound design . Cathy McAuley is delightful as the pretty but gawky Kathleen , the neurotic of Walter ' s dreams . The play soars , despite some turbulence in the second act , in which Kathleen turns unmotivatedly capricious . Also , there ' s a corny &quot; last leaf &quot; metaphor that was shopworn when O . Henry used it . For the most part , however , Arbaugh is a witty chronicler of life in the down-and-dirty singles marshlands . Kathleen and Walter ' s ungainly mating dance makes a_couple_of amorous whooping_cranes look_like Astaire and Rogers . * &quot; Is There Life After Birth ? &quot; Tamarind Theatre , 5919 Franklin Ave. , Hollywood . Thursdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 7 p.m. Ends May 29 . $ 15 . ( 213 ) 466-1767 . Running time : 1 hour , 50 minutes . ' Into the Woods ' a Pleasant Surprise * Like the classic fairy tales upon which it is based , &quot; Into the Woods , &quot; currently at Actors Co-op , bears frequent repeating . For those already familiar_with the show , this version will be a pleasant surprise , at least in most particulars . In the intimacy of this small theater , not a single word of Stephen Sondheim ' s wonderful lyrics or James Lapine ' s book are lost . This production is not a big-budget extravaganza , but rather a comfortable bedtime story . The show ' s designers have worked ingeniously to scale . The sets , costumes and lighting are handsome and versatile . Teresa Klorer ' s miniaturist choreography nicely fills the postage-stamp space . Robin Strand ' s direction is nimble , never claustrophobic . Unfortunately , some of the performers are vocally strained by Sondheim ' s virtuosic score , but even if a_few voices are not Broadway caliber , the show stands_up to the occasional clinker . Sondheim ' s &quot; giants in the sky &quot; may have been cut_down to size , but they still loom tall in this production , which has been reduced but not diminished . * &quot; Into the Woods , &quot; Actors Co-op at the Crossley Theatre , 1760 N . Gower , Hollywood . Thursdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 2:30 p.m. Ends June 19 . $ 15 . ( 213 ) 964-3586 . Running time : 2 hours , 50 minutes . Fine Rendition of a Dated ' Working ' * What a difference a decade makes -- particularly when the decade in_question ends with one of the most ravaging recessions in post-Depression history . A musical based on Studs Terkel ' s book &quot; Working , &quot; at the Colony ' s Studio Theatre Playhouse , first opened in the late ' 70s . A little more_than 15 years later , it seems surprisingly anachronistic . Proud goldbrickers , the play ' s secretary and editor probably would not survive long in today ' s drastically downsized corporation . The glamorous hooker doesn ' t even mention AIDS . Many modern-day educators would likely be happy to change places with the schoolteacher , who frets that she can ' t find time to teach spelling &quot; between weaving and clay. &quot; Even paperboys have gone the way of the Pony_Express rider , replaced largely by an adult work_force . Fortunately , the voices are good and the performances heartfelt . Director-choreographer Todd Nielsen has a solid grasp on composition and pacing . Richard D . Bluhm ' s utilitarian scenic design is user-friendly . &quot; Working &quot; may_not yet be a candidate for the time_capsule , but it has mellowed into a nostalgic period_piece , a barometer of just how quickly society can change -- not always for the better . * &quot; Working , &quot; the Colony at the Studio Theatre Playhouse , 1944 Riverside Drive , Los Angeles . Wednesdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 2 p.m. Ends July 10 . $ 20- $ 24 . ( 213 ) 665-3011 . Running time : 2 hours , 15 minutes . ' Down the_Hill ' a Histrionic Wallow * Playwright John Ford Noonan and director Dorothy Lyman have worked together before . Lyman directed the original Off-Broadway production of Noonan ' s &quot; A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking. &quot; Call this , their latest collaboration , &quot; A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Twitching. &quot; &quot; Music From Down the_Hill &quot; at the Odyssey deals with two roommates-patients at a private mental facility . These &quot; chicks &quot; clash , bond , slash and despond in a shallow wallow of histrionic pain . Lisa Picotte and Lee Garlington are accomplished actresses who tackle their roles as the mentally disturbed roomies with all_the conviction of their craft . However , the fact that they must slash themselves at predictable junctures and persistently chat with a teddy_bear undermines their efforts , however heroic . Lyman ' s journeywoman direction is an equally thankless task . As for Noonan ' s play , the plot is too neat , the sentiment too easy , the metaphor too forced and the characters too picturesquely insane to be credible . If only the mentally_ill were this adorable -- or this easily cured . * &quot; Music From Down the_Hill , &quot; Odyssey Theatre , 2055 S . Sepulveda Blvd. , Los Angeles . Thursdays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 7 p.m. Matinees May 22 and June 5 , 2 p.m. $ 17.50- $ 21.50. ( 310 ) 477-2055 . Running time : 2 hours , 35 minutes .</TEXT>
