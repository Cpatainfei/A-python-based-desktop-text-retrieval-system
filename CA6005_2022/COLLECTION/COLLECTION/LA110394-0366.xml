   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; INSIDE THE ADS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> GOVERNOR Gov . Pete Wilson released two new television commercials Wednesday . Here is the text of the ads with analysis . * THE AD : &quot; They are as different as two people can be . On crime , Pete Wilson was the force behind the tough new &quot; three strikes &quot; and &quot; one strike &quot; laws . And he has enforced the death_penalty . . . . Brown opposes the death_penalty , is supported by criminal defense_lawyers , and will appoint more lenient judges . . . . Wilson pushed_through tax incentives and cut red_tape to keep business and jobs in California . . . . Brown has a plan that will increase taxes and drive jobs out of California. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Although Wilson played a key role in the passage of the &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing measure and signed the bill , the force behind it was Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was killed by an ex-convict . Brown personally opposes the death_penalty but has said she will see that it is carried_out if she is elected and will appoint judges who believe_in capital_punishment . Wilson signed a record $ 7-billion tax increase in 1991 . Two years later , he pushed for tax_breaks for business totaling about $ 500 million , including a sales tax exemption for the purchase of new manufacturing equipment . Though his Administration has tried to coordinate government programs to help businesses stay in California , the state has lost about half a_million jobs since Wilson took_office . The only tax increase in Brown ' s plan is a 15 % excise_tax on the sale of ammunition . There is no evidence her plan would drive_out jobs . * THE AD : &quot; Kathleen Brown supports continuing state services to illegals even though it costs taxpayers over $ 2 billion a year . Another reason we need Pete Wilson as governor. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : The only major service on which the two candidates disagree is public education . Brown says it would be unwise to expel illegal immigrants from the public_schools because the state then would have to deal with 300 # 000 idle children . Brown , like Wilson , believes the federal_government should pay_for all_the state ' s cost of serving illegal immigrants . TREASURER The two major party candidates in the race for state_treasurer are expecting television ads now running to be the deciding factor_in their contest . Until last weekend , Republican Matt Fong , a member of the State Board of Equalization , and Democrat Phil Angelides , a developer , had aired only positive ads . But Sunday , Phil Angelides came_out with the campaign ' s first negative commercial , a 30-second spot depicting Fong as a wasteful spender who whiles away his working_days as a public official playing golf . * THE AD : Photographed in a shaky , spontaneous-looking camera style , the commercial opens with a shot into Fong ' s Board of Equalization office . As an announcer intones : &quot; There are things candidate for treasurer Matt Fong doesn ' t want you to see , &quot; a hand covers the lens of the camera . &quot; Matt Fong spent over $ 5 million for his new government_offices and the building owners gave him free office space for his political_campaign , &quot; the announcer says . Repeatedly using the hand-over-lens device , the ad goes_on to say that Fong &quot; gets a government expense_account , drives a free car and is out golfing during working hours. &quot; It closes by noting that during Fong ' s tenure , the board ' s budget increased $ 42 million . * THE ANALYSIS : Fong , who was appointed to the five-member tax board in 1991 , did select a new office in a City of Industry complex managed by Majestic Realty Co . The state_Department of General Services negotiated a $ 300 # 000 -- not a $ 5-million -- contract to rent the office . The same month the rental contract was signed , Majestic Realty began providing Fong free office space for his campaign . In 1994 , the General Services_Agency sought competitive bids for a new regional Board of Equalization office and awarded a $ 5-million rental contract to the low bidder -- at the same location and to the same interests as those providing Fong free office space . However , department records indicate that Fong had no role in the selection of that site or the awarding of the contract . Like many officials holding high state offices , Fong is provided travel expenses and a car . He did show on his financial reports that he accepted free golf_games on seven occasions , but says that on the days that he played during working hours , he took vacation time . The board ' s budget is established by the Legislature , which has in recent years provided more money to the agency to hire more auditors to catch tax cheats . PROPOSITION 186 Both sides of the campaign over Proposition 186 , the single-payer health_care initiative , have been using television ads statewide . The initiative would , if fully implemented , create a state-run health_insurance system designed to replace the current one based on private insurance . Money raised in part by tax increases would be used to dispense more_than $ 100 billion in health benefits annually to more_than 30 million Californians . * THE ADS &quot; FOR &quot; : One 30-second spot features representatives from the California Nurses Assn. , Consumers Union , the California branch of the American Assn . of Retired Persons and the California League of Women Voters . Each speaks , and as the ad runs , their voices and images dissolve into each other . The ad tells viewers , &quot; Proposition 186 will give each of us complete health_care that can never be taken away. &quot; It goes_on to say , &quot; It was put_on the ballot by a_million Californians , &quot; and , &quot; The insurance_companies are spending millions of dollars to kill 186. &quot; Another ad involves a series of images of children , one in a wheelchair , two in a sandbox , others in various forms of play . The announcer asks , &quot; What will happen to our children ? &quot; and mentions the possibility of their losing medical insurance , making the statement : &quot; We are all at risk &quot; and repeats the statement about insurance_companies trying to kill the measure . * ANALYSIS : Sponsors of the initiative say they chose to present nurses as supporters because nurses are trusted more_than insurance_companies . With roughly 80 % of Californians now holding health_insurance , supporters want to persuade voters that their plan is better . The California Nurses Assn . represents about 25 # 000 nurses , roughly 10 % of all California nurses . Though the California branch of AARP endorses the measure , organizations representing retirees from Los Angeles County and state_governments oppose the initiative , contending their members would lose benefits if it passes . * THE ADS &quot; AGAINST &quot; : One ad shows a politician with two aides nearby . An announcer says that the initiative would give an &quot; elected politician &quot; the right to ration health_care with the statement , &quot; Medical decisions made by a politician . . . for political reasons. &quot; A female aide says , &quot; We ' re out of money . . . we have to cut something or raise taxes. &quot; The male aide , holding_up a polling chart , responds : &quot; Hip transplants . . . only lose a_few thousand votes there . . . . &quot; Another ad shows a woman with her family in a park . She says , &quot; Like most families , we support health_care reform . But we can ' t support this Proposition 186. &quot; She goes_on to say the initiative &quot; would take_away our private coverage and force us into a government-run system headed by an elected politician. &quot; She also expresses alarm over the prospects that her California income_tax &quot; would nearly double. &quot; At the end of the ad , opponents of the initiative are cited that include business and taxpayer groups as well as the Organization of Nurse Executives / California . * THE ANALYSIS : Though the new system would be headed by an elected officeholder , medical decisions , such_as those on hip replacements , would be expressly left with physicians . The initiative would not &quot; take_away &quot; private coverage and , in fact , the statement in the ad contradicts what opponents have said elsewhere . Although the initiative would impose tax increases , the ad neglects to say that taxpayers would be relieved of health_insurance premium payments and a substantial amount of out-of-pocket medical_expenses . One study said that the average Californian would save $ 550 annually on health_care , even with the new taxes . The organization of nurses represents 1 # 100 nurses who perform administrative duties .</TEXT>
