   <HEADLINE> HANTAVIRUS THREAT FOUND IN COUNTY ; HEALTH : A STRAIN OF THE VIRUS THAT HAS KILLED 42 PEOPLE IS FOUND IN MICE TRAPPED AT CRYSTAL COVE STATE PARK . HEALTH OFFICIALS URGE HIKERS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Researchers in Orange County and New Mexico said Thursday they have identified a new and potentially deadly strain of the hantavirus in harvest_mice trapped in Crystal Cove State Park . The hantavirus previously found in deer_mice killed 42 people in 18 states , mostly in the Four Corners area of the Southwest . Among the fatalities were two California cases , but there were none reported in Orange County . &quot; There ' s no way to tell from the data we have now whether ( the new strain ) has any disease-causing ability , but because it is close to the Four Corners strain , we have to assume that it may have that capability , &quot; said James P . Webb , Jr. , ecologist with the Orange County Vector Control District . Officials in New Mexico , where at least one harvest_mouse with the strain was identified , announced its discovery Thursday . Webb said that no people have been infected , and Orange County health officials have no plans to bar visitors to Crystal Cove . &quot; We ' re recommending that this is another precaution in going_into wild areas , along with poison_oak , mountain_lions , rattlesnakes and coyotes , &quot; Webb said . &quot; Stay_on the trails there , and you ' re probably not going_to have any problems. &quot; Hikers who leave the trail &quot; shouldn ' t be kicking_up a lot of dust , or digging holes or trenches . Make_sure to camp in an area that ' s free_of rodents or rodent droppings , &quot; he said . Routine testing of rodents in recent months turned_up five infected harvest_mice -- four at Crystal Cove and one in South County , near the TRW testing facility , according to Webb . * The harvest_mice had been collected earlier this year and sent to New Mexico , where they were analyzed by Brian Hjelle , assistant_professor of pathology at the University of New Mexico School_of_Medicine in Albuquerque . &quot; They determined that initially we have another species of mouse , a harvest_mouse , carrying a related strain of hantavirus related to the Four Corners virus , &quot; Webb said . &quot; Subsequently , we sent_in another sample from harvest_mice &quot; from the Crystal Cove area , Webb said , taken_after the Laguna fire in January . &quot; Out of that came four more positives. &quot; There are distinct differences between the different harvest_mice and deer_mice , which were responsible_for the deaths . The harvest_mouse , Webb said , &quot; tends not to go_into buildings . It is found in more grassland areas , and builds its nest on the ground , it does not tunnel under the ground. &quot; In the initial outbreak , people became infected with the hantavirus by inhaling airborne particles of urine or saliva of infected deer_mice . Early symptoms of the illness mirror the flu . The disease progresses rapidly , causing breathing difficulties and filling the lungs with fluid . Hantavirus is fatal about 60 % of the time .
