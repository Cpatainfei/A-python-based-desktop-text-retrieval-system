   <HEADLINE> ON THE HAMBURGER TRAIL ; A SIMPLE BURGER ? IN THE WORLD OF FAST FOOD , THERE ' S NO SUCH THING -- ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF LAST YEAR ' S FOOD_POISONINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thursday , June 30 , North San Diego , Calif. : Jack in the Box decides to promote quarter-pound hamburgers in Seattle and Los Angeles during the week of July 25 . Tuesday , July 5 , North San Diego , Calif. : The purchasing department calculates that the promotion will double quarter-pounder sales and places an order with SSI Foods Inc. , for more_than 40 # 000 pounds of patties . Friday , July 15 , Widmer , Idaho. : Using frozen beef from Australia , fresh beef from Idaho ad Western Montana as well as some fresh beef fat from Washington , SSI begins forming 920 cases of quarter-pound hamburgers . Tuesday , July 19 , Carson , Calif. : Silliker Laboratories receives a sample of frozen hamburgers from SSI ' s Friday production . The lab begins to test for E . coli 0157 : H7 . At the same time Foodmaker begins its own testing process . Wednesday , July 20 , Carson , Calif. : All samples of SSI hamburger production from the previous Friday are declared clean . Friday , July 22 , City of Commerce , Calif. : Cases of SSI ' s frozen hamburgers arrive_at Foodmaker ' s distribution center aboard specially equipped freezer trucks . Monday , July 25 , City of Commerce , Calif. : Frozen quarter-pound hamburgers are delivered to Jack in the Box restaurants including the North Hollywood location on Laurel Canyon Boulevard . Friday , July 29 , North Hollywood , Calif. : The new shipment of quarter-pound Jumbo Jacks are cooked to serve a busy lunch crowd . * Americans -- in a comfortable , familial way -- take hamburgers for granted . The relationship is not really extended_to any other food . Sure , pizza and hot dogs are popular . But burger joints are part of the landscape -- much like the post_office or corner gas_station , except much more popular . Not even a surge of outbreaks linked to E . coli 0157 : H7 bacteria in the last 21 months -- resulting in more_than 700 serious illnesses and four deaths -- could slow sales . But just what is hamburger ? Where does the meat come from ? And what is being done to prevent a repeat of the E . coli 0157 : H7 incident ? The simple , plain fast-food hamburger is actually the result of a highly complex series of processes stretching halfway around the world , involving thousands of people , incorporating high science as well as manual_labor and including meat from hundreds of different animals . In the wake of last year ' s food_poisonings , Foodmaker ' s Jack in the Box chain has taken the lead in incorporating the latest safety technology into food service . Other chains , such_as Taco Bell and McDonalds , are close to implementing similar system-wide food safety programs but Foodmaker is the acknowledged leader . &quot; Not only are Foodmaker executives committed to ensuring that this never happens again at Jack in the Box but they are also instrumental in working to find a complete treatment and cure for E . coli 0157 : H7 illnesses , &quot; said Bob Galler , whose 3-year-old died from the infection and who now heads an E . coli victims ' support group named after his daughter , the Lois Joy Galler Foundation . Foodmaker donated $ 100 # 000 to the Galler Foundation last January . To trace the story of one burger , The Times was given unlimited access to follow how the Jack in the Box chain orders , processes , stores , transports , laboratory-tests , cooks and serves its hamburgers . Foodmaker Inc. , the parent company , made private business documents available ; no questions were considered out-of-bounds . Suppliers and contractors also cooperated , with one exception : The Times could not gain access to one slaughter facility , although other , similar facilities were toured . Here is the story of that &quot; simple &quot; hamburger . Tuesday , July 5 , 1994 . North San Diego . Foodmaker ' s North San Diego headquarters has high , almost windowless adobe walls and a forbidding aspect ; it seems more fortress than the support center for 1 # 175 Jack in the Box_family restaurants . It ' s also busy . The summer months generate some of the year ' s heaviest customer traffic throughout the chain . Preparations are now being made_for a special promotion in one of the company ' s six Western regions . The previous Thursday -- June 30 -- the marketing group decided to promote quarter-pound burgers for the week of July 25 in a region including Los Angeles and Seattle . Today , marketing sends an advertising directive to the purchasing director , who puts the necessary food orders through to the inventory management group . The two staffs are working several weeks in_advance and are now focusing_on food deliveries for the end of July . Jack in the Box has the most ambitious menu of the fast-food chains with items based on five different cuisines : Japanese , Greek , Mexican , Chinese and regional American . But the bestseller has always been hamburgers . Only two sizes -- a regular 1.6-ounce and a four-ounce Jumbo Jack patty -- are served . The company estimates that stores carrying the Jumbo Jack promotion will double their sales of the patty that week . In a regular week , the total sales from the 65 stores in the targeted region would amount to more_than 10 tons of quarter-pound patties . This promotion should bump the figure to an entire tractor-trailer load of 160 # 000 quarter-pound burgers . The order is punched into a computer terminal linked by modem to the company ' s distribution centers . A copy is sent via computer_network to SSI Food Services Inc. in Widmer , Idaho . SSI is one of only two Jack in the Box patty suppliers and , while unaware until now of the July 25 promotion , its supplies are in the pipeline . The next morning , July 6 , SSI places its orders to slaughterhouses for enough beef to fill the order . Friday , July 15 . Widmer , Idaho . SSI Foods Inc. ' s beef processing facility operates in a world of cold . Even in the blistering summer heat , the plant ' s temperatures are kept at 40 degrees or below in work areas and sub-zero in freezers . You never know what season it is outside the building because inside it is always uniformly , bone-chilling cold . To stay warm and optimize sanitation , employees are dressed in bulky white coveralls , nets for head and even facial hair , hard_hats and thick gloves . Some wear protective goggles . Once every 24 hours , the entire plant is completely disassembled and cleaned with soap and hot water , then sanitized with a chlorine-based solution . On-site USDA inspectors then check for any sanitary deficiencies before the plant can restart production . &quot; Look : This is a clean plant , &quot; SSI President Kirk Smith insists , pointing to stainless-steel equipment that shimmers in the artificial fluorescent light . &quot; We make the best product possible . In this business , if garbage comes_in the door then garbage goes_out the door . There is no garbage here. &quot; In slaughterhouses in Australia , Idaho and Washington state , beef carcasses have been butchered in the traditional manner : the leanest meat placed in one container ; prime cuts sent_in another direction , and pure fat placed into other , specific boxes . At SSI , lean beef and pure fat -- which could be from different ranches , states , regions or even countries -- are ground together to a customer ' s specifications and then formed into that familiar round patty . The quarter-pound patties being blended by SSI today include meat that is 50 % lean from the Monfort Co. , just down the road in Nampa , Idaho , and meat that is 90 % lean shipped in from New South Wales , Australia . If necessary , and it usually is , fresh beef fat from Iowa Beef Processors in Pasco , Wash. , is used to obtain the target of 26 % fat in the quarter-pound patty . The actual mixture of this Jack in the Box order will be about 40 % American beef and 60 % Australian beef . Most of the American beef came from Monfort , a division of food giant Con Agra , which culls from ranches within a 200-square-mile area including the southwest corner of Idaho , Eastern Oregon , Washington and western Montana . The plant handles between 700 and 1 # 000 head per day . For this Jack in the Box order , the beef is from cattle on ranches in Idaho and western Montana . After the animals were stunned , bled , skinned , gutted and chilled , Monfort sent the beef carcasses through its processing line for butchering . Meat was separated manually by an army of butchers and meat cutters . Then Monfort trucked the beef in 2 # 000-pound combo bins up Interstate 84 to SSI to be blended into hamburger patties . The Australian beef comes from a large shipment of frozen beef SSI received by ocean freighter on June 24 in Oakland . The 2 # 000-pound bins were then transported to Widmer , about an hour north of Boise . Dave Theno , Foodmaker ' s vice_president for quality assurance and product safety , says the Australians make an excellent product that is less expensive , even with shipping costs , than similar-quality American meat . The Australian beef is a product of Lackley Ltd. , a New South Wales-based company . The Aussie cattle were slaughtered in Macksville on May 30 , or more_than a month before Jack in the Box corporate officials decided to promote quarter-pound hamburgers . ( SSI has a standing_order for about one million pounds of Australia beef per week for Jack in the Box and other clients. ) Regardless of how cold and clean SSI ' s plant is , you can ' t tell whether harmful organisms are present . Ironically , neither can USDA employees in the current federal meat inspection program , who rely_on sight , scent and touch to identify these invisible threats . In fact , detection of the organisms in_question requires extensive microbiological testing . Thus , SSI operates its own state-of-art laboratory . Neither the in-house lab nor independent outside laboratories have ever found E . coli 0157 : H7 in SSI beef . Monfort has even tested cattle manure looking_for E . coli traces but none have been found , says Smith . Still , three samples are taken from each tractor-trailer load of meat or fat that is delivered to SSI for further analysis . Since the 1993 E . coli contamination , Jack in the Box has changed hamburger sources . Foodmaker ' s new policy is strict : If a processor ' s ground meat tests positive for the bacteria more_than once , that firm is dropped from the supply system . Any product that contains the harmful bacteria , and there have been several , is destroyed , Theno says . Tuesday , July 19 , 1994 . Carson , Calif . The human_body provides the ideal breeding_ground for E . coli 0157 : H7 -- the organism thrives at about 98 degrees , or average body_temperature . Once ingested , there is nothing to stop its growth and treatment is limited . &quot; There is a lot of E . coli ' s ecology that isn ' t understood , &quot; says Foodmaker ' s Theno . &quot; It is a single cell , simple organism that needs more research . What we do know is that 90 % of the E . coli cells that may be present in meat , for instance , will tolerate freezing temperatures well and just become dormant ( until thawed ) . &quot; It is no longer enough for Jack in the Box that Monfort has lab-tested cattle manure , or that one of its slaughterhouses conducts microbiological surveys on each day ' s production , or that SSI tests both incoming and outgoing meat . Now , every shipment of hamburgers destined for Jack in the Box restaurants is placed on hold while Silliker Laboratories of California Inc. , located in Carson , tests a representative_sample for E . coli 0157 : H7 . The procedure can take between one and six days , depending_on whether any of the contaminant is present . Nothing leaves SSI or the other processors until the samples have been declared clean by Silliker . The testing procedure is done_in two steps . The first , which can be completed within 26 to 28 hours , can tell only whether the general family of E . coli organisms -- which are common in the intestines of both humans and animals -- are present . If any organisms are detected , an additional five days of complicated microbiological testing determines whether the bacteria are the harmful variety . Silliker tests ground_beef for a number of clients in addition to Jack in the Box . The lab says it ' s getting positives on the first test once or twice a month and finding the potentially fatal E . coli 0157 : H7 once every four months . By Tuesday afternoon , July 19 , Silliker informs Foodmaker that SSI ' s Friday production of quarter-pound patties is clean . Wednesday , July 20 , 1994 . North San Diego . At the same time Silliker is running the E . coli tests , Foodmaker ' s own Quality Assurance Laboratory is also testing the hamburgers from the previous Friday ' s production at SSI . Technicians will determine whether the patties meet the chain ' s physical , chemical and microbiological specifications . &quot; The best line_of_defense is to make_sure the thing is cooked properly , &quot; says Theno . &quot; A problem or glitch could arise because of the wrong weight , shape or size . You can learn that just by cooking. &quot; At the moment , two lab technicians are cooking three regular-size hamburger patties according to Jack in the Box procedures . Cooking temperatures and times are monitored by computer . Once cooked , the burgers are taken_off the grill and checked for thorough cooking . The patties are torn_apart to make_sure that no pink , uncooked beef remains , a color change that occurs at about 155 degrees . Having experienced the trauma of a food_poisoning outbreak that may have been caused by improper cooking , Foodmaker has become extremely attentive to the issue . The company and an independent manufacturer jointly developed a specially designed thermo-probe that is sensitive enough to get an instantaneous heat reading in the different parts of the thin hamburger meat . After quickly analyzing the three samples both visually and with the thermo-probe , the lab tech announces , &quot; everything is cooked. &quot; Friday , July 22 , 1994 . City of Commerce . In addition to following long-standing safety practices , every refrigerated tractor-trailer that unloads at Foodmaker ' s giant warehouse in Commerce carries a vital piece of equipment . Drivers check to see that the seal on the trailer ' s door is intact and that the refrigeration equipment is working . They also check the load ' s temperature . Most importantly , the driver and the warehouse supervisor inspect the Stires Temperature Recorder , the equivalent of the black_box on a commercial airplane . The Stires keeps a constant record of the internal temperature of the trailer for as_many as eight days . Soon after going_to work for Jack in the Box , Theno required that all trucks carry it . &quot; One year ago we would do a visual inspection of the truck and a temperature check upon arrival but we would n ' t know what happened inside the trailer in Arizona or New Mexico . Now we do , &quot; says Les Gardner , distribution center manager . Foodmaker requires that trucks maintain a temperature of less than 10 degrees but prefers the level to remain around zero . A few readings blip upward toward 10 degrees on the Stires printout for this meat delivery , but all else looks good and the truck can be unloaded . Another set of checks begins when Foodmaker delivers patties to the restaurants in its own fleet of trucks . Again , the Foodmaker trailers are equipped with Stires temperature recorders or an on-board computer that records the trailer ' s temperature . Beginning Monday , July 25 , the warehouse will deliver the SSI hamburgers . From the Commerce warehouse , 440 Jack in the Box restaurants are supplied throughout Southern California , Las Vegas and the Colorado_River resort area . Foodmaker drivers have only 20 minutes to unload their trucks into the individual store ' s freezers . Friday , July 29 , 1994 . Laurel Canyon Boulevard , North Hollywood . Lunch is always the busiest time for fast-food restaurants . Today at the Jack in the Box_in North Hollywood is no exception . There ' s a fast-moving line of cars at the drive-up window . Inside , workers on lunch break crowd the counter to order . Families of four sit at tables , their plastic trays brimming with paper-wrapped hamburgers , large drinks and French fries . The place hums with conversation and laughter . Even an LAPD squad_car swoops in_for a quick stop at the drive-up window . Twenty-one months ago , this particular restaurant could have been giving_away food and not found any takers , but time has dimmed memories of the E . coli 0157 : H7 episode . The number of guests eating here is not the only difference . The kitchen has been compartmentalized to separate raw foods from cooked , ready-to-eat items . No one ever touches an uncooked hamburger at Jack in the Box . All are carefully handled with utensils . Jack in the Box cooks its hamburgers from frozen patties to eliminate guesswork about thawing times , because they are easier to handle and because there are no meat juices present that can spread contamination . The cook places a quarter-pounder on the 375-degree grill and hits a timer . After a_few minutes , an overhead digital monitor sounds a sharp alarm , directing the cook to flip the burger . It sounds again when the burger has finished cooking . The final cooking phase is called the quality flip : The cook turns the patty a second time , notches the center with a spatula and makes_sure the meat is cooked to a brown color throughout . If there is any pink , the burger remains on the grill until done . The chain will not serve burgers cooked rare or medium-rare . The backbone of the Jack in the Box system is a food safety program developed by industry food scientists and called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point or HACCP . The program here is represented by series of checklists and reports completed by employees as often as once each six-hour shift . Most extensive is the HACCP shift checklist , which identifies 33 critical_points throughout the restaurant that need to be inspected by the manager . In addition to the shift checklist , temperatures of all cooking surfaces must be taken twice daily . Another weekly checklist is also required of each restaurant , with 54 areas that need review . The weekly list is comparable_to those used by local health inspectors . Finally , a team of company auditors visits the restaurants about once a month with its own checklist to make_sure each Jack in the Box is operating at optimum sanitation and is accurately completing the HACCP checklists . &quot; I ' ve spent a lot of time in the field traveling_to many of our restaurants , and I can now say that we have a darned good food safety system , &quot; says Foodmaker ' s Theno . &quot; We also believe that we can give something back to our industry , and we will share the results of our program at scientific gatherings and other industry meetings . &quot; HACCP ( had never been ) designed for quick-serve restaurants . It was more suited to slaughterhouses and meat processing plants . There has never been this kind of safety system for restaurants , and I can now say that it is do-able . When we show this to the rest of the industry , it will turn_on a light for a lot of people. &quot; And what about the hamburger that began its journey several weeks before and thousands of miles away ? It was simple and good . More importantly , there was every reason to believe it was safe . * The Man Who Saved Jack in the Box H8</TEXT>
