   <HEADLINE> LEON LEYSON OF FULLERTON WILL NEVER FORGET THE NAZIS OR THEIR BRUTALITY . BUT HIS STRONGEST MEMORY IS OF THE HUMANITY OF OSKAR SCHINDLER , WHO PUT HIM ON A . . . ; SURVIVORS ' LIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The memories , Leon Leyson says , have not diminished with time . Memories -- of German troops invading Poland in 1939 and his family being herded into the Jewish ghetto in Krakow when he was 9 . . . . Of hiding in a cramped attic crawl space to avoid being killed or sent to a death camp by SS commandos who periodically swept_through the Jewish quarter . . . . Of living_in a concentration_camp run_by a sadistic SS commandant who would shoot Jews for sport . . . . Of wondering whether he ' d have enough bread to eat for the day or whether he ' d even live until tomorrow . . . . And of a German industrialist -- a war-profiteering Nazi_Party member -- who saved Leyson ' s life and the lives of 1 # 100 other Jews who worked for him : The memories of a Schindlerjude , a Schindler Jew . &quot; He was very good to me , &quot; Leyson says of Oskar Schindler , the true-life hero of &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; Steven Spielberg ' s critically acclaimed movie adaptation of Thomas Keneally ' s fact-based novel . Leyson was 13 when he joined his other family members working_at Schindler ' s enamel works factory . Schindler frequently ordered that Leyson be given extra soup , and he called the skinny boy who had to stand on a box to operate a lathe &quot; Little Leyson. &quot; Leyson ' s father -- a tool-and-die maker -- was one of the first Jews to go_to work_at Schindler ' s factory , which produced mess_kits and pots and pans for the German army . Ultimately , Leyson , his mother , a brother and a sister would all work for Schindler -- one of the few families to do so . Two of Leyson ' s older brothers , however , did not survive the war . One , who was taken from the Jewish ghetto , died in an extermination camp . The other was murdered by the Nazis , along with 500 other Jews living_in the Leysons ' hometown on the northeastern border of Poland . Leyson , 63 , who teaches industrial arts at Huntington Park High_School , hasn ' t talked much about that time of his life . &quot; Periodically , &quot; he says , &quot; some things come_out in conversations with people. &quot; But for the most part he has kept his memories to himself . Elisabeth , his Ohio-born wife of 28 years , has often urged him to talk_about his experiences . &quot; I think it ' s a miraculous story that many people would find inspirational and really amazing , &quot; she says . Leyson ' s children -- Daniel , 24 ; and Stacy , 25 -- are familiar_with their father ' s background . But Leyson says his sister , Aviva , who now lives_in Israel , once started to tell her story for an oral history project and couldn ' t finish . &quot; I can identify with that , &quot; he says . So it was with &quot; some real reservations &quot; that Leyson recently agreed to talk_about his wartime memories and about &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; the movie that tells the story of the man who made a fortune in the war by using unpaid Jewish labor and then spent that fortune to save their lives . Leyson sat on the edge of a white sofa in the living room of his two-story house in Fullerton , thousands of miles and a lifetime away from the Jewish ghetto and concentration_camp where he spent five years of his youth . His arms resting_on his knees and his hands tightly clasped , the soft-spoken Leyson said he saw &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; at an invitational screening for other Schindler Jews in West Los Angeles . He didn ' t know what to expect of the movie , which was shot on location in Poland , but he found it &quot; startlingly effective and quite authentic . I was amazed to see these places looking very much like I remember. &quot; At times , he said , watching the film &quot; was like having an out-of-body experience because those little kids who were running_around and hiding and trying to get_away from the Sondercommando ( the brutal SS commando troops ) , that was me . That was my friends. &quot; * His family , Leyson said , had moved from their hometown near the Russian border to Krakow a year before the Germans arrived in his country . His father , Moric , worked in a glass factory across from the Jewish-owned factory Schindler would eventually take_over . Even before the Germans invaded Poland , Leyson said , they had heard that the Germans were mistreating Jews inside Germany , &quot; so we had some inkling of it , but nothing of the sort that it ended_up to be . We had no idea. &quot; The only experience his parents had had with the Germans was during World_War I . &quot; To them , yes , the Germans forced people to work , and they would release them after they finished their work . So it looked_like in the beginning that it was the same thing . But it was nothing like it. &quot; Within six months , Poland ' s Jews were forced to move_into a newly closed-off area of Krakow . Leyson ' s parents piled as_many belongings as they could into suitcases and onto sheets , which they tied_up at the corners and made into bundles . &quot; We just loaded everything up_on a wagon , &quot; he recalled . &quot; Whatever we couldn ' t move we just left there. &quot; Their home had been in an apartment_building not far from the Jewish ghetto . One of his father ' s co-workers at the glass factory had been living_in the ghetto area and , not being a Jew , had to move_out . So the two families traded apartments . The Leysons lived for two years in the ghetto , an area of only 16 square_blocks surrounded by a newly erected brick wall whose rounded-off top reminded Leyson of grave markers . &quot; I don ' t think that was an accident , &quot; he said . In some cases , two or three families lived_in a single room . The Leysons divided up their sole bedroom with blankets and shared it with an older Jewish couple , German refugees who would later be hauled_off to a death camp . Food was scarce . Meat -- chicken mostly -- was a luxury . Some food was bought on the black_market or smuggled in by Jews who were allowed to work_on the outside . Although Jews working in Schindler ' s factory were not paid , Leyson said , &quot; there was a benefit : You got a loaf_of_bread once in a while , and you ' d get a bowl of soup at lunch time. &quot; In the beginning , killings in the ghetto were sporadic . &quot; Here and there a soldier would decide he wanted to kill somebody , &quot; said Leyson . You could never tell when that might happen , &quot; so you always walked_around with that funny feeling in the back of your head , that you don ' t know who was pointing a gun at you. &quot; &quot; To give you an idea , the whole time that this was taking_place -- from the time of the ghetto to the time of liberation -- there were only two thoughts in mind : to have something to eat and keep yourself from getting killed. &quot; It didn ' t take long before the killings became more organized . SS commandos would surround the ghetto and then move through , carting_off families to a railroad_station where they would be sent to extermination camps . Anyone who resisted or was found hiding or was infirm was shot . &quot; There were several actions like these where they kept removing people from the ghetto and shrinking it , &quot; said Leyson . &quot; At one point , you had to have a special card , and if you didn ' t have that you were taken_away . My father had a card , and so we were not taken_away . But my older brother was supposed to have his own card . He didn ' t have it. &quot; In the movie , Schindler is shown going_to the train_station to rescue his Jewish accountant from a death camp-bound train . Also on that train was Leyson ' s older brother , Betsalil , whom Schindler also tried to save . The Leysons later learned , however , that Betsalil ' s girlfriend was with him and he would n ' t get_off without her . He died in the concentration_camp . One time when the SS commandos surrounded the ghetto , Leyson said , it was obvious what was going_to happen . His father and brother David were already working for Schindler , and Schindler advised his workers not to go_back home after work . &quot; He kept them in the factory , &quot; said Leyson , who , along with his mother , was inside the ghetto . This time , he said , no ID card could prevent them from being removed . &quot; It was just if you got caught you were gone , &quot; he said . So he and a_few other boys climbed_up into the attic crawl space in a one-story structure attached_to their apartment_building . Leyson ' s mother , Anna , and another boy ' s mother said they were not going_to hide , that they ' d take their chances . But at the last minute , as the sound of gunshots and the commandos shouting for people to come_out of their homes echoed through the streets , Leyson ' s mother climbed into the cramped hideaway -- setting_down the teapot full of water she had intended to hand up_to the boys . The entire time the SS were operating in the courtyard , Leyson said , his mother ' s teapot was sitting there . And as they frighteningly peeked down at the courtyard through cracks in the wooden building , they saw the other mother , trying to look inconspicuous by sweeping the ground , taken_away by the commandos . &quot; I can recount dozens of times where if I had stepped . . . to my left , I would have been gone , or if I happened to step to my right , &quot; said Leyson . &quot; It wasn ' t anything like being smart or clever or anything like that. &quot; Just luck , he said . One time he and a friend took an old_woman to a hospital inside the ghetto on a stretcher and they were a_few minutes late for the curfew . As they walked by one of the gates , a guard spotted them and took his rifle off his shoulder . Leyson ' s friend , who was a_few steps ahead of him , ran past the soldier and into the house where they lived . The guard fired at him and missed , then turned and fired a shot at Leyson , who ran in the opposite direction and ducked into the recessed entry of an apartment_house . &quot; Luckily , someone let me in , &quot; he said . &quot; It could have happened that the people were scared enough not to open the door , but they did , and I spent the night there. &quot; But , he said , &quot; that ' s just one small incident , and it wasn ' t long before things got really , really awful. &quot; In 1943 , the ghetto was liquidated , soldiers dragging families from their apartments and again shooting anyone who resisted . Jews who worked in factories , however , were assigned to Plaszow , a forced-labor camp on the outskirts of Krakow . Each group of factory_workers marched_out together , but before Leyson ' s group was out of the ghetto , a guard pulled him out of line , saying , &quot; Jew , you come later. &quot; &quot; I wasn ' t smart enough to know something bad is going_to happen , but I knew enough that I didn ' t want to ' come later , ' &quot; said Leyson . Not wanting to be grouped with_children or old people who were certain to be killed , he sneaked back in_line with another group . At Plaszow , which was built_on a Jewish graveyard , Leyson and other Jews were forced to dig_up the graves , smashing the grave markers into pieces to use for a road in the camp . The camp was run_by a psychopathic commandant named Amon Goeth , who is depicted in the movie sitting on the balcony of his hilltop villa and shooting at Jews below with his rifle . Leyson says the movie was an accurate portrayal of the brutal Goeth . &quot; He was the most sadistic , unpredictable person that you can ever meet , &quot; said Leyson , adding that Jewish workers passing_through the gate in the evening would ask among themselves what the &quot; score &quot; was that day . Leyson had several encounters with Goeth . At one point , Leyson was working the night_shift in the camp brush factory when Goeth and his henchmen came_through . For some unknown reason , Goeth pulled_out his gun and shot a man . They then took everyone outside and began separating the workers into two groups . Leyson , who was now about 13 , was told to go_to the side with the young and the old . &quot; It didn ' t look good to me , &quot; he said . Again , as the guards were walking back and forth , he was able to sneak back to the other side and &quot; sort of blend_in with the others. &quot; Another time he was among a group working_on the road when Goeth came_through and didn ' t like the way things were going . He then lined everybody up and had the guards pull people out of line and give them 25 lashes . &quot; I was the lucky recipient of 25 , &quot; said Leyson . Then , Goeth lost interest and left . The reason ? &quot; The story has it that sort of toward evening time , Schindler came_by to visit and word was sent to Goeth that Schindler was there , and so the whole_thing stopped and he went_back over to visit with Schindler. &quot; Leyson said that he knew Schindler quite well and that one of his disappointments with Spielberg ' s movie is that more of Schindler ' s &quot; basic human decency &quot; wasn ' t portrayed on screen . Schindler is accurately portrayed as a womanizer and a war profiteer who used bribes and his considerable charisma to reap massive profits through his Nazi connections , but the man Leyson knew frequently displayed a sense of decency , of humanity . The fact that Schindler , at the request of Leyson ' s father , brought Leyson ' s mother , brother and sister over to work in Schindler ' s factory -- keeping an entire family together -- is one example , he said . Leyson recalls working night_shifts with his brother and father and seeing the flamboyant Schindler come_through the factory after a night of partying with his Nazi friends . &quot; You didn ' t have to look_to know that Schindler was there , &quot; he said . &quot; He was all perfumed up and smoking these cigarettes . And he ' d come_through and he ' d do things , not grandstanding or anything . He ' d just quietly come_up_to my father , put his arm around his shoulder and say , ' Don ' t worry ; everything is going_to be OK. ' &quot; Other times , Leyson said , Schindler would leave a lighted cigarette or a half-filled pack next to his father ' s workstation and casually walk away . Those are the kinds of things you don ' t see in the movie , Leyson said . &quot; He was a womanizer -- everybody knows that -- and he liked a good party , but you have to judge the man by what he did . He did great things , actually. &quot; Leyson has no doubt that Schindler was motivated to draw_up his now-famous list for humanitarian rather than profit-making reasons : to move 1 # 100 Jewish workers en masse to a new factory in relatively safe Czechoslovakia . Leyson never knew why , but he , his father and brother were mistakenly left_off the list . They were lined_up and getting ready to be shipped out_to an extermination camp when Schindler came_by with several people . Wanting to get his attention , Leyson started moving toward the front of the line . A guard hit him with his rifle_butt , and Leyson dropped the Thermos he had been holding . Schindler heard the noise , turned and saw Leyson . &quot; I yelled out , ' We ' re not on the list , my father , brother and I , ' &quot; Leyson recalled . &quot; He immediately ordered that we be put_on the list. &quot; But more significant than that , Leyson said , Schindler &quot; went_back to where the others were kept who were_on the list and told my mother not to worry. &quot; In one of the most harrowing sequences in the movie , the trainload of women from Schindler ' s factory are mistakenly routed to Auschwitz , where they are herded into the showers , not knowing whether gas or water would come_out . Leyson ' s mother and sister were_on that train . Schindler , who refused an offer to replace them with 300 other workers , used his money and influence to get them back . &quot; Once he was into this business of transporting us from Poland to Czechoslovakia , and especially his accomplishment of getting the women from Auschwitz to Czechoslovakia , you knew that he was not doing_it to make a profit . He was simply doing the right thing , &quot; Leyson said . Once in Czechoslovakia , the 1 # 100 Jews spent the next eight months working in Schindler ' s new factory and living_in an adjoining concentration_camp , a time Leyson remembers being the hungriest he had ever been . Then the war ended . Schindler , accompanied by several older Jews , left in the middle of the night to avoid being captured by the Russian army . Before he left , however , his workers gave him a gift : a ring made of gold from one of his worker ' s teeth and inscribed with the Talmudic verse : &quot; Whoever saves one life , saves the world entire. &quot; The Leysons and the other Schindler Jews were repatriated to Poland . &quot; But soon after we got there we realized that Poland was not the place for us . We were not greeted warmly , to say the least . There were a lot of people rioting against the returning Jews. &quot; A year after returning home , he said , &quot; we had to go hide again. &quot; They smuggled themselves across the border back into Czechoslovakia . From there they traveled_to Austria and then to Germany , where they wound_up in a displaced-persons camp . And there they remained until 1949 . that ' s when Leyson ' s aunt , who had lived_in the United States since the early 1900s and had thought they had perished with the rest of the Jews in Poland , learned through a search organization where they were and arranged for them to come_to Los Angeles . Schindler ' s life , too , changed dramatically . Penniless after the war , he and his wife immigrated to Argentina , where he turned_to farming . After 10 unsuccessful years , he left his wife and returned to Germany , where he was taken_care of by his former workers , the Schindler Jews . Leyson would meet Schindler again , on a visit Schindler made to the United States a_few years before he died in 1974 . He was among a group of Jews who met Schindler at the airport . &quot; I started to tell him who I was , &quot; recalled Leyson . But he didn ' t need to . Schindler grinned at the middle-aged man standing in front of him and said , &quot; I know who you are , you ' re little Leyson. &quot;</TEXT>
