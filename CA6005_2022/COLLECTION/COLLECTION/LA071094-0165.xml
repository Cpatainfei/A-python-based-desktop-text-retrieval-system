   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE WATCH : ENOUGH ALREADY , NICOLE ' S NEIGHBORS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is it simple curiosity that has brought so many reporters and other gawkers to Brentwood ? Or is it a void on the home front ? The latter , according to a sign posted on Bundy Avenue in Brentwood , near Nicole Brown Simpson ' s condominium . While some homemade signs_in the area have greeted visitors with basic messages such_as &quot; Go_Home . . . There is Nothing 2 See , &quot; another , spotted last week , offered some advice . &quot; Media &amp; Lookie-Loos : GET-A-LIFE , &quot; it said . &quot; Go_Home And Live Your Own So We Can Live Ours In Peace. &quot; * LABOR PAINS : Their vote of support for the North_American Free_Trade Agreement is haunting U.S. Reps . Howard Berman ( D-Panorama City ) and Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills. ) Recently , NAFTA foes effectively vetoed a move by delegates of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor to endorse the ongoing reelection bids of Beilenson , whose district includes Malibu , and Berman , who has strong Westside political ties . Before the delegates was a recommendation made by the federation ' s political wing and its new secretary-treasurer , Jim Wood . But the measure failed to win the two-thirds ' margin needed for adoption . According to dissident Carl Kessler , a veteran delegate from the International Assn . of Machinists and Aerospace Workers , the rejection was unprecedented . The delegates routinely adopt the recommendations of the federation ' s political wing , he said . &quot; I ' ve been here since 1959 , and it ' s never happened before. &quot; Wood , who recently replaced Bill Robertson as federation leader , blamed himself for tactical errors that contributed to the defeat of the proposal . A union endorsement of the congressmen may still be forthcoming when the_matter is taken_up again at a state convention of labor_unions later this month , Wood said . But he refused to make a prediction . &quot; This issue is real emotional , and I would n ' t want to predict an outcome , &quot; he said . * ANIMAL HOUSE : This Beverly Hills party will be really wild . Jewelry giant Tiffany &amp; Co . plans to sponsor a star-studded benefit Tuesday at 2 Rodeo Drive for the Mkomazi Rhino Sanctuary in Tanzania , where poaching has killed_off much of the wildlife population . Jacqueline Bisset , Anjelica Huston and photographer Herb Ritts are among those expected . The real stars , though , will be the live animals on display -- a zebra , a chimpanzee and a baby elephant . But don ' t fear for your life . &quot; These animals are pretty tame because they work in movies all_the time , &quot; noted publicist Craig Donahue .
