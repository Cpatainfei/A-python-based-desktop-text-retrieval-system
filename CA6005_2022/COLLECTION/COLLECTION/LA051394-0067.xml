   <HEADLINE> JUSTICES OPEN_DOOR TO SUITS BY EMPLOYEES ; COURTS : RULING ALLOWS WOMAN TO CHARGE FALSE IMPRISONMENT OVER QUESTIONING IN THEFT . WORKERS ' COMP IS GENERALLY THE SOLE RECOURSE FOR PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL INJURY AT_WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The California Supreme Court , providing a crack in the shield that protects employers from most workers ' suits , held Thursday that a Los Angeles Fedco employee can sue the chain for falsely imprisoning her during an interrogation over whether she stole $ 4.95. The unanimous decision is significant because California workers generally have no recourse in the courts when they are injured physically or emotionally on_the_job . They can obtain relief only by collecting limited amounts from the state ' s workers ' compensation system . In the case before the high_court , sales clerk Julie Fermino said that in 1990 , managers and security agents at Fedco Inc. ' s Westside store imprisoned her for more_than an hour in a windowless room . Fermino said a security agent falsely charged that witnesses had seen her pocket a $ 4.95 sale , refused to let her call her mother , &quot; hurled profanities &quot; at her and pressed her to confess &quot; the Fedco way. &quot; The Fedco way , as outlined by the security agent , was to award one point for each time the clerk denied her guilt . When the count reached 14 , the agent told her , she would be turned_over to the police . The clerk , then 18 , said she repeatedly asked to leave and when she moved toward the door , one of the security_guards slid in front of it , threw_up a hand and gestured to stop . After she became hysterical , she said , the security agents finally said they believed her and let her go . She quit her job shortly thereafter . In an opinion written by Justice Stanley Mosk , the court held that false_imprisonment is not a normal aspect of employment , even if it is motivated by an employer ' s reasonable objectives . &quot; False imprisonment is , by definition , an unreasonable and indeed criminal confinement , &quot; Mosk wrote . &quot; It is the close cousin of assault. &quot; Fedco had argued that the alleged false_imprisonment was carried_out in a reasonable manner and asserted the store ' s right to hold and question employees to protect against theft . The Supreme Court ruling overturns two lower court decisions that denied Fermino the right to proceed with her suit . Now a student and part-time cashier , Fermino is seeking $ 200 # 000 for her pain and suffering and unspecified punitive damages intended to deter Fedco from such behavior . Robert M . Ball , a Beverly Hills lawyer who represented Fermino , said security departments of major stores are under pressure to &quot; produce numbers to justify their existence. &quot; &quot; You have to wonder , &quot; Ball said , &quot; whether this type of treatment of employees is somewhat connected to the recent rash of workplace violence. &quot; The case posed a test between merchants ' rights to protect themselves against theft and employees ' rights to not to be held against their will at the whim of their employers , he said . The court said it was not denying employers the right to detain workers suspected of theft or to fire them if they refuse to cooperate . But if the employers ' actions go beyond reasonable interrogation and detention and become false_imprisonment , they are not protected from lawsuits . Ball said the case met the test of false_imprisonment because Fermino was denied the right to leave and threatened with arrest if she did not confess . Fermino said she was ecstatic about the decision . The Fedco job was &quot; my first real job , &quot; she said , and the interrogation was &quot; totally humiliating and frightening. &quot; &quot; I would never want that to happen to anyone else , &quot; she said . The court ' s decision probably will trigger more lawsuits alleging false_imprisonment , said Steven Weston , attorney for Fedco . The chain did not dispute the facts of the case , arguing instead that such suits are barred by workers ' compensation law . Now that the suit can proceed , Fedco will investigate Fermino ' s allegations thoroughly , he said . &quot; Fedco has not committed any improper acts , &quot; he said . Victor Schachter , a San Francisco attorney who represents employers , said the case was important because it defines a line between normal and abnormal employer behavior and appears to contradict previous decisions by the conservative court . &quot; I am surprised because there have been other outrageous kinds of cases in which the courts have said that it is included within the workers ' compensation system , &quot; Schachter said . But he said he doubted the decision would trigger massive litigation because the employer ' s alleged behavior in the case was extreme .</TEXT>
