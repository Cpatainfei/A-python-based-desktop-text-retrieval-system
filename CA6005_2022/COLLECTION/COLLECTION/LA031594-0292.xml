   <HEADLINE> UCI GRAD RETURNS HOME TO DANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Homecoming , the theme of the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble ' s program here tonight , has special meaning to troupe member Katalin Gyulai . As a teen-ager , she emigrated with her parents from Hungary to Irvine , but went_back to Hungary after graduating with a bachelor ' s degree in economics from UC Irvine in 1990 . &quot; I moved_back because I prefer living_in Hungary , &quot; said the 27-year-old dancer , who served as interpreter for artistic director Sandor Timar during a recent interview . &quot; I didn ' t really feel at_home in the United States. &quot; She said her parents , Peter and Katherine , left Hungary because they didn ' t like the former Communist regime ( they still live_in Irvine ) but added that life in post-Communist Hungary has its own drawbacks , particularly with an inflation_rate that sits at 20 % this year . On the plus side , she said she is &quot; really glad to see more things to buy &quot; in Hungary , such_as kiwi and stylish clothing . &quot; And now we can travel anywhere . &quot; I know that the country has to correct a lot of things that the government ruined in the last few decades . It will take a long_time , but I ' m patient. &quot; ZAN DUBIN</TEXT>
