   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; ACCOUNTING_FIRM FAILED TO DETECT FUND ' S PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> KPMG Peat Marwick -- one of the giant accounting_firms that got_into trouble for failing to flag the problems that led to the nation ' s savings and loan debacle -- had been asked_for the past two years to pay special attention to the Orange County treasurer ' s office . But a December , 1993 , letter accompanying last year ' s audit said the firm detected only one problem -- one that already had been spotted years earlier , involving wire transfers on behalf of county departments . There was not a word about Treasurer Robert L . Citron ' s investment practices , which a year later led the county into the nation ' s biggest municipal bankruptcy filing ever . This year ' s audit , which normally would have been made public by this time , has been held_up at the request of the county . Peat Marwick spokesman Kevin Kelly said Friday that the firm stands_by its work for the county . He said Peat Marwick was asked only to look_at the county ' s investment portfolio -- not Citron ' s policies . But Kelly acknowledged that as part of the firm ' s regular audit of the county , &quot; when you conduct an overall audit , you do look_for weaknesses in controls. &quot; The California Board of Accountancy , which regulates accountants and auditors , may look_into Peat Marwick ' s county audits , board executive_officer Carol Sigmann said Friday . &quot; At this point , we ' re gathering facts . If the facts indicate that it ' s appropriate to investigate them , we will investigate , &quot; Sigmann said . &quot; I would say any firm , auditor or accountant involved in this process is going_to be under scrutiny until this whole matter is resolved. &quot; Although none have actually filed suit , lawyers for investors in the county ' s bankrupt pool and for buyers of county bonds are beginning to talk_about Peat Marwick as partly responsible_for the county ' s financial calamity and a potential &quot; deep pocket &quot; defendant in a lawsuit . In its capacity as the county ' s independent auditor for the past three years , they argue , Peat Marwick should have paid greater attention to the treasurer ' s investment operations , which previous internal audits had found to be marred by violations of state laws and regulations . And by the time Peat Marwick began its latest audit , a political rival of Citron had publicly claimed that the treasurer ' s investment strategies had lost $ 1.2 billion of taxpayers ' money . &quot; You can bet that we will be examining this . . . and the extent that problems were ignored , &quot; said Mel Weiss , an attorney who has filed a class-action suit on behalf of bondholders who purchased a series of Orange County bonds sold last summer . * Officials of the worldwide accounting_firm have contributed more_than $ 9 # 000 to the campaigns of incumbents and candidates for the Board of Supervisors over the last 15 years . Those donations -- calculated in a review by The Times of campaign finance reports -- raised questions among independent analysts about whether the auditors had kept at arm ' s length from county officials whose operations they were auditing . &quot; Independent auditors are supposed to be independent -- in fact and appearance , &quot; said John Larsen , a USC professor of accounting . &quot; This appears to be a monetary form of schmoozing. &quot; However , Herb Finkston , director of professional ethics for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants , said there are no professional guidelines prohibiting such contributions . &quot; You can ' t exclude an auditor from the political process simply because he ' s an auditor , &quot; Finkston said . &quot; In any event , we ' re talking_about appearances . It ' s really nothing more_than some evidence of a relationship which is inconclusive. &quot; Kelly declined to say whether the firm had a critical internal audit of the treasurer ' s office for 1991 in_hand as it conducted its audit in 1993 , the year that the internal audit was issued . &quot; We were not engaged to do an investigation into internal controls of the treasurer ' s office , &quot; he said . &quot; We stand_by our management letters issued for fiscal_years 1992 and 1993 . They ' re appropriate and consistent with an independent accountant ' s professional obligations. &quot; County Auditor Steven A . Lewis said he made a &quot; special request &quot; that Peat Marwick take a closer look_at the investment portfolio in its 1993 and 1994 county audits . Despite the request , Lewis said , the auditors ' findings do not contain a thorough analysis of the investment pool . &quot; I didn ' t contract with them to make a detailed analysis of the portfolio . On the other hand , because there had been concerns , you just say , ' Look_at this particular area ' ; then they spend a_couple_of extra hours on it , &quot; he said . &quot; For the last two audits , that has been a special request. &quot; Lewis said he wanted &quot; to be fair &quot; to Peat Marwick , but noted that independent auditors are supposed to assess internal controls . &quot; Just like I do_in my audit , they have to assess internal controls , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . They have professional standards that they have to go_on , just like I do. &quot; This is not the first time the thoroughness of Peat Marwick ' s audits has been questioned in Orange County . The firm paid $ 200 # 000 in October to settle a claim that it failed to discover a multimillion-dollar embezzlement by Stephen Wagner , the former finance director of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District . Under Peat Marwick ' s watch -- or that of firms it later bought -- more_than $ 1.7 million disappeared , said Michael Fine , district director of fiscal services . &quot; The audit wasn ' t adequately planned , and the sample size wasn ' t adequate &quot; to catch the problems , Fine said . Peat Marwick -- which acted_as the district ' s outside auditor from June , 1982 , to July , 1988 -- settled with Newport-Mesa before a suit was filed , admitting no wrongdoing . After discrepancies in the district ' s books were discovered , Wagner was arrested and ultimately convicted of embezzling a total of $ 3.7 million . He is still in prison . The New York-based firm , one of the &quot; Big Six &quot; accounting practices , also has repeatedly been taken_to task for failing to catch problems as the nation ' s savings and loan scandal unfolded . Peat Marwick agreed to pay the federal_government $ 185.6 million in August to settle allegations that its work played a role in the failure of several savings institutions dating_back to the 1980s . Two of the failed financial_institutions were in Orange County : Costa Mesa-based Pacific Savings Bank , seized by regulators in 1989 , and Orange-based Ramona Savings &amp; Loan , taken_over in 1986 . * Accounting and legal_experts say Peat Marwick , one of the world ' s largest accounting_firms , should have spotted the problems in Citron ' s office in the course of normal auditing practices . While they agree that no auditor is expected to act_as an investment_adviser , they say part of an auditor ' s responsibility is to look_at the potential risks for an organization ' s major assets -- in Orange County ' s case , its multibillion-dollar investment pool . Auditors should , as a matter of practice , take_into_account every bit of internal documentation that would point to problems , including previous internal audits , these experts said . &quot; You would think they would take_a_look at what the risks were , &quot; said Larsen , who specializes in ethics and professional standards for accountants . Some accounting experts said the competition for clients has caused auditors in_general to go easy on their clients in hopes of keeping them happy -- and getting their contracts renewed , though none had a basis for raising such allegations against Peat Marwick for its work in Orange County . &quot; I think that the environment hasn ' t been so good , &quot; said Don Kirk , former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and recently the chairman of a panel that looked_into the independence of auditors for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants . &quot; The competition for clients sometimes causes them to maybe lose sight of their public responsibility , &quot; Kirk said . Weiss , the securities lawyer , said that it would be unconscionable for an auditing firm not to review internal controls or violations of investment rules , regulations and policies . &quot; The import here is that the auditors say that they don ' t have the responsibility that the rest of us think they have , &quot; Weiss said .</TEXT>
