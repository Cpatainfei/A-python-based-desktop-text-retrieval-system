   <HEADLINE> AMID ' SLEAZE ' CHARGES , MAJOR FIRES 2ND MINISTER ; BRITAIN : THE TORY LEADER ALSO TELLS PARLIAMENT HE WAS APPROACHED BY AN ' INTERMEDIARY ' FROM A KEY FIGURE IN ETHICS SCANDAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to dispel widespread charges of &quot; sleaze &quot; in his Conservative government , Prime_Minister John Major fired a second minister Tuesday for unspecified &quot; allegations &quot; concerning his ethical conduct . Major publicly fired Member_of_Parliament Neil Hamilton , a colorful Trade Department minister , in a statement to the House of Commons after Hamilton had refused to resign when accused of unethically assisting Mohammed Al Fayed , head of the famous London department_store Harrods . Hamilton ' s ouster follows that last week of another minister , Tim Smith , after Smith was accused of accepting money to raise questions in the House of Commons on behalf of Al Fayed ' s successful takeover of the department_store ' s corporate body , the House of Fraser . In his Commons speech Tuesday , the prime_minister also said that he had been approached recently by an Al Fayed &quot; intermediary &quot; who wanted to discuss the House of Fraser takeover fight . Major said he rejected the overture , but neither he nor his aides at the prime_minister ' s office would identify the &quot; intermediary. &quot; Following Major ' s speech , Conservative Member_of_Parliament Peter Tapsell asked_in the Commons if Major was being subjected_to possible &quot; blackmail , &quot; and the prime_minister said the_matter was being referred to the director of public prosecutions . Al Fayed quickly denied any suggestion he was involved in trying to blackmail the prime_minister . In one side of an exchange of letters released late Tuesday , Hamilton charged that he was a victim of &quot; foully motivated rumor &quot; and a &quot; media witch hunt , &quot; and he vowed to clear his name . In reply , Major said he was concerned about the &quot; general perception &quot; of his government and that the Hamilton episode was a &quot; damaging distraction. &quot; In delivering the dramatic announcements in Parliament , Major said that Hamilton had been cleared by Cabinet Secretary Robin Butler of &quot; cash for questions &quot; but that other &quot; unconnected allegations &quot; had arisen recently . He did not specify what those allegations were . Members_of_Parliament can submit written questions that lead to formal answers by relevant government_departments that can be embarrassing to corporations -- in this case , the conglomerate Lonrho , which controlled Harrods and was fighting the Al Fayed takeover . Earlier this year , two back-bench Conservative members_of_Parliament were accused of accepting funds from a leading lobbying firm to ask questions in Parliament on behalf of Al Fayed . The sleaze issue has been seized upon by the opposition Labor and Liberal_parties , which have accused Tory members_of_Parliament of signing_on to lobbyists ' payrolls as &quot; consultants , &quot; sometimes without declaring their interest , as required by parliamentary rules . On Tuesday , Home_Secretary Michael Howard confirmed that he too had been investigated by Cabinet Secretary Butler during the cash-for-questions inquiry , but he said he had &quot; never been guilty of any impropriety in the conduct of any of my responsibilities. &quot; Al Fayed , a big contributor to the Conservative_Party under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher , has made threats to reveal that various government_ministers accepted money or favors from him . The Egyptian-born Al Fayed sought support in his takeover_bid for the House of Fraser and withdrawal of an unfavorable Trade Department report on his activities and business background . Major also announced Tuesday that he is setting_up a blue-ribbon commission headed by a senior judge to launch a broad , unprecedented investigation into the rules and standards governing the conduct of British public officials . The uproar over &quot; sleaze &quot; comes at an especially sensitive time for the prime_minister , who is perceived finally to have a firm grasp on his party and enjoys credit for making long strides toward peace in Northern_Ireland .</TEXT>
