   <HEADLINE> THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER : TRIUMPH OF PARTY POLITICS OVER IDEOLOGY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to toughness on immigration issues , Rep . Duncan Hunter ( R-El Cajon ) has few peers . During his 6 1 / 2 terms in Congress , Hunter has tirelessly fought to gain control over the U.S.-Mexico border , the country ' s superhighway for illegal immigration . With anti-immigrant feeling in California rising and his GOP-leaning 52nd District encompassing most of the state ' s southern boundary , Hunter ' s tough stance is a political no-brainer . He has pushed for the construction of a 10-foot steel wall to replace the ragged chain-link fence long regarded_as a mockery of border security . He has sought improvements to border roads , giving U.S. agents better mobility to pursue the thousands of illegal immigrants who cross northward every year . Along with a host of other House Republicans , he has demanded a tightening of immigration procedures and begged for some enforcement muscle to back_up the dry rhetoric of federal laws . And last year , in a notable success , he shepherded an appropriation through Congress aimed at hiring 600 new Border_Patrol agents . It was a rare concrete accomplishment amid the swirl of emotional proposals over the immigration issue . He quickly dubbed it the_Hunter Amendment . * So why then , during debate on the California earthquake aid bill last month , did Hunter vote for a budget-cutting amendment that would have slashed some of the very Border_Patrol funds he fought so hard to get ? Because Hunter faced a dilemma : be true_to his immigration views or to Republican fiscal values ? Party loyalty won -- and in this Congress it has been winning these contests as much as ever . &quot; I didn ' t like the idea that there were some Border_Patrol funds ( cut ) in the bill , &quot; Hunter explained , &quot; but I figured that what I was successful doing last year I could do again. &quot; Hunter ' s optimism is founded on his amendment ' s comfortable margin of victory . But to Democrats who have tracked Hunter ' s Border_Patrol votes , his shifting of positions is nothing more_than political opportunism . &quot; This is wholly inconsistent , &quot; said Rep . Neal Smith ( D-Iowa ) , the Appropriations Committee &quot; cardinal &quot; who controls Border_Patrol funding . &quot; One year he votes to cut $ 78 million ( from the Border_Patrol ) , the next year he votes for adding $ 60 million , then he votes to delay the 600 agents ( funded ) in his own amendment . To me this is serious business , not political business . We should figure_out the number of agents needed and pay_for them. &quot; * Smith ' s yearning is woefully ill-timed . Congress has rarely been so partisan . Vote studies by Congressional Quarterly show that Democrats and Republicans in both chambers voted with the majority of their parties ( and against the majority of the other party ) more often in 1993 than in any year in the previous four decades . Hunter is one of 11 Republicans who voted the party_line 98 % of the time . Only two others were more dutiful . Several factors converge to explain the rampant partisanship , but all spring from Bill_Clinton ' s occupancy of the White_House . After 12 years of Republican presidents , Clinton ' s embrace of controversial issues cleaved Congress into neat partisan camps . In order to keep the Clinton program moving ahead , Democrats blocked more Republican floor amendments , in turn yielding more procedural votes that naturally break along party_lines . The net effect is that any hope for bipartisan unity -- on virtually any major piece of legislation -- can be kissed goodby . * The hard-headed Hunter , a member of the House GOP leadership who recoils at the idea of accommodation with Democrats , can be counted_on to vote the GOP party_line -- even if it imperils his own prized legislative victories . Indeed , the ascension of party orthodoxy in the 103rd Congress seems to have energized Hunter , who likes nothing better than a good round of bruising political fisticuffs . &quot; You have to do what you think is right , ( but sometimes ) you don ' t have a chance . These large spending bills are put_in large blocks so the argument can be made that you have to vote for more spending because something you like in the bill will otherwise be denied . I reject that notion. &quot;</TEXT>
