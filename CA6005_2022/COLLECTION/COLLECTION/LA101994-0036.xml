   <HEADLINE> CELLULAR PHONE FIRMS FIGHT HIGH-TECH WAR WITH PIRATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Neither police investigators nor cellular_phone officials know exactly how long Abner Pajounia and Davoud Yashoron operated the alleged dark side of their electronics shop on La Cienega Boulevard . But Glendale police_detectives -- who arrested the owners of Master Mobile Sound on Friday and then , posing as salesmen , conducted a sting operation over the weekend -- say the store was all too typical of those that have made cellular_telephone fraud a high-tech crime of epic proportions . Police and telephone_company officials on Tuesday proudly displayed more_than 100 illegal &quot; clone &quot; phones and the computer equipment needed to make them , and said that when the costs of the illegal calls are tabulated , it could turn_out to be one of the biggest cellular_phone fraud busts ever in Southern California . But authorities face a daunting task in trying to eliminate a fraud problem that accounts_for an estimated $ 300 million a year in illegal calls nationwide -- and Los Angeles , the cellular_phone capital of the country , is also the fraud capital . Now law_enforcement officials and cellular_phone company technicians -- desperate to protect a dynamic industry that has created tens of thousands of jobs and altered the lifestyles of millions of Americans -- are redoubling their efforts . AirTouch Cellular , one of the two big cellular carriers in Los Angeles , has dispatched more_than 250 private_detectives to scour Southland streets to identify cellular_phone fraud . The industry is unleashing an array of powerful new electronic countermeasures that could take a big bite_out of the problem -- but also might alienate some customers and saddle companies with both financial and operational burdens . LA Cellular , which is subject_to far more fraud than rival AirTouch Cellular , has quietly introduced a code system that could eventually require all customers to electronically &quot; unlock &quot; their cellular_phones with an eight-digit code before making calls , according to an internal memorandum obtained by The Times . The company is also testing an electronic anti-fraud system_called Operation Blackbird . Meanwhile , around the country , elaborate fraud detection schemes with names such_as &quot; Fraudbuster &quot; and &quot; Clone Detector &quot; are being deployed . &quot; We have launched our own high-tech war back at criminals , &quot; said Mike Houghton , a spokesman for the Cellular Telephone Industry Assn . &quot; When this first started , we didn ' t know how to fight back. &quot; Most cellular_phone fraud involves &quot; cloning , &quot; a process in which a thief steals the electronic serial number of a customer ' s cellular_phone and programs it into a computer chip , thus making a perfect duplicate , or &quot; clone &quot; of that customer ' s phone . While cloning has been going_on for some time , it has grown rapidly and become much more sophisticated as the cellular_phone industry has exploded . With 1.2 million customers , LA Cellular and AirTouch operate in the nation ' s largest cellular_phone market , and while they won ' t discuss losses from fraud , market_analysts and industry insiders say they have been among the hardest hit companies in the nation . According to David Gamson , a legislative aide to state Sen . Herschel Rosenthal ( D-Los Angeles ) , author of a bill that raised the theft of cellular_phone service to a felony crime beginning this year , about one out of every four cellular_phone calls made from Los Angeles is made from a counterfeit phone . In some poorer Los Angeles neighborhoods , phone counterfeiters offer unlimited long-distance phone_calls to customers for about $ 75 a month , said Detective Richard Garcia , who is assigned to the sheriff ' s Lomita station in southern Los Angeles County . In another variation , phone bandits set_up call-selling schemes in which they use two cloned phones patched together and link callers with anyone anywhere in the world for between $ 10 and $ 20 per call , said Chuck Ortmann , the resident agent in_charge of the Riverside County office of the U.S. Secret_Service , which recently busted an Ontario call-sell operation . While these types of calls do not exactly represent lost business for the cellular carriers -- customers in the fraud schemes generally would not be subscribers -- the illegal calls soak_up valuable capacity on cellular systems . In addition , they can be a major inconvenience for subscribers whose phones are cloned : While they don ' t have to pay_for clone calls , their numbers have to be changed , and straightening_out the billing can be a major hassle . &quot; I first found_out about being cloned when I received a bill for $ 7 # 000 , &quot; said Kenneth Hirsch , a West Hills dentist . &quot; It looked_like a United Nations : There were calls to Chicago , Ireland , South_Africa , Russia , Lebanon and all_over the U.S. &quot; When I first called LA Cellular , they told me the fraud department will contact me soon . The next month , an additional $ 2 # 000 showed_up . . . . This was about four , five months ago . Since then they never got_back to me , but they keep sending me the bills . I have called them four , five times. &quot; LA Cellular officials say they believe that the problem is serious enough that many customers will voluntarily adopt the company ' s new Fraud Prevention Feature ( FPF ) , which will require them to enter * 56 plus plus a four-digit personal identification_number . And some resellers who asked not to be identified said they believe that the company plans eventually to make_it a mandatory feature . Jim Goode , in_charge of fraud prevention for LA Cellular , acknowledged that the company plans to push the fraud-prevention feature aggressively , but denied that there are any plans to make_it mandatory . &quot; Cell fraud is a complex problem , and FPF is just one of many tools we use to combat that fraud , &quot; Goode said . Some of the other tools are elaborate indeed . The Operation Blackbird technology precisely analyzes the radio_signals emitted by each phone and uses the information to create an &quot; electronic fingerprint , &quot; which is then checked every time that phone is used . If a mismatch is detected , the call will not go_through . AirTouch has already implemented a similar system_called Phoneprint . Other countermeasures include systems that monitor and record customers ' phone-calling patterns and alert company officials when wide variations are found . A sudden series of calls to Latin_America , for example , would trigger an alert if that subscriber had never called there before . McCaw Cellular is experimenting with a voice-activated system that would require callers to match a voice print kept_on record with the company before the phone could be turned_on , said Jane O ' Donaghue , a company spokeswoman . And then there are the more conventional methods of thwarting cellular pirates , such_as contacting the person who receives an illegal phone_call . &quot; We are going_to find_out who you are by who you call , &quot; Dave Daniels , head of security at AirTouch promised . &quot; We have no qualms about subpoenaing someone ' s mother , brother or sister into court . If they ' re foolish enough to want to get friends , relatives and business associates hauled into court , so be it. &quot; Privately , some law_enforcement officers complain that prosecutors have been reluctant to file felony charges even when strong cases are brought_to them . But prosecution is becoming more aggressive : In one of the largest cases to date , Rodney Phillips , 29 , of Los Angeles , was recently convicted of possessing more_than 20 altered phones and 200 phone_numbers that AirTouch officials say were used to make more_than $ 2 million in fraudulent phone_calls . Phillips ' sentencing is scheduled for November , said U.S. Atty . Christopher Tayback . Since last October , the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , guided by information provided by AirTouch , has made 340 arrests for phone fraud , Daniels said . LA Cellular would not provide details of arrests made through its investigations . Sheriff ' s Detective Rich Garcia , hailed both by Daniels and his colleagues as a phone-clone hunter extraordinaire , said LA Cellular ' s reluctance to share information with authorities may have made them a favorite target of phone bandits . &quot; They are the biggest victims in the cloned phones , &quot; he said recently &quot; Eighty percent of our cases are_on LA Cellular . They have been more difficult to deal with and didn ' t provide information in a timely manner. &quot; No matter what the companies and law_enforcement agencies do , though , the bandits will be working_on ways to continue plying their trade . Currently , the technical mainstay of cloning is a an electronic_device -- called an ESN reader -- phone bandits use to send a false signal to trick cellular_phones , which respond by identifying themselves with the internal serial number and the phone_number . Serial numbers are also sometimes stolen and sold by company employees . With this information , creating a clone phone is relatively easy . &quot; I found_out about how to put two phones together that work_on the same line at the cellular_phone store I used to work_at . . . . It ' s pretty easy , &quot; said one phone pirate who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that his name not be used . &quot; Originally I did_it for a_couple_of friends and then it got_out of hand . People started coming_over , and they had 30-day guarantees and you have to honor those , &quot; he said . When these phones are sold by the pirates , he explained , they come_with a 30-day guarantee of service . If a phone is shut_off before then , the buyer is given another number to use . The pirate said a phone cloner can get_into the business for $ 6 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 . That includes the price of the computer gear needed to reprogram the phones and the fee paid to the technician who actually reprograms the chips . A well-connected phone-clone salesman can sell 100 phones a week at about $ 100 per phone . He said the cloned phones are widespread and are used by people across the socioeconomic spectrum . Some businesses use the cloned phones because they are a lot cheaper than paying_for a legitimate service , he claims . And many of the people who use these phones , he claims , don ' t realize they are using a subscriber ' s phone_number . &quot; They just feel_like they ' re just screwing the phone_company and who cares about them ? &quot;</TEXT>
