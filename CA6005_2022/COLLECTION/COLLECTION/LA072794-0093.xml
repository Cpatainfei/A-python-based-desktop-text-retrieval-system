   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE / COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; FORUM ; WHAT INTERNET USERS THINK OF PORN INCIDENT , MEDIA COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last week , The Cutting Edge invited comment on the issues raised by a July 12 Times story about the discovery of a large cache of pornography on an Internet-linked computer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . The original story also discussed how the Internet was being used to distribute stolen software . The article drew angry responses from many Internet users ; we printed some of those responses last week , along with a brief commentary . We also asked readers for their thoughts on the issues of security on the Internet and on the news media ' s coverage of the Internet . The initial reaction on the Net to the story was heavy with personal attacks on the reporter , but nearly all_of the more_than 40 people who responded to our solicitation addressed the serious issues . Below are excerpts from some of the messages we received , followed by our comments : * Unfortunately for those of us who love it dearly , you made ( the Internet ) out_to be a big , bad thing . Very little was said about its positive applications . . . . I got no sense of what an incredible resource it is . DAVID AUGSBURGER Sherman Oaks * I found the July 12 story on the illegal use of LLNL computers to be highly interesting . . . . I think the L.A. Times received so_much flap over the story from Internet users because no one is ever delighted with investigative journalists poking their noses into his / her affairs . The Internet is a public place , and journalists have the right to poke around if they choose . That does not mean that the people whose affairs are being investigated have to like it . . . . I did take_issue with the focus_on pornographic images in the article . This seemed to be a clear shot at sensationalizing the findings . ANN TERESE HEIL Arcadia * Essentially , the persons who put those images on the computers were merely stealing -- stealing storage_space from Lawrence Livermore . Would it have been a newsworthy story if someone had found that an MTA ( Metropolitan Transportation Authority ) employee had used MTA filing_cabinets to store a_few hundred copies of Penthouse magazine or adult videotapes ? Of course not . ROBIN D . ROBERTS Thousand Oaks * The real story , which you are missing , is how this free flow of information is revolutionizing the way people work and interact . The Internet is the ultimate productivity tool , and the print media are failing to get that issue across to their readers . That , not the aberrations on which the media have focused , is the reason why traffic on the Net increases by 10 % a month . A.T. YOUNG * With rising concerns about stolen software , pornography , etc. , I am worried that institutions ( usually colleges ) will remove or severely restrict the ability of users to contribute to their creative works . I wish to urge institutions too concerned about undesirable contributions to make their incoming directories write-only ( chmod 333 ) rather than removing them altogether . This will give the site administrators a chance to review files before putting them in a public area . JOHN KALSTROM Goleta * We must find a balance between total freedom on the ' Net , which may have been possible when there were only a_few hundred_thousand connected but certainly is not now , and the kind of watchdog police_state that many foresee as the future . . . . Oddly , to me it seems like those most aggressive in defending the anarchic nature of the ' Net are the same ones who are quickest to step_on the toes of anyone who doesn ' t toe THEIR line . MARGARET E . HOLDAM Westwood * Many respondents made comments similar to Robin Roberts ' , asserting that storing private files on a government or company computer was not a major issue . But the computer was accessible via the Internet -- and almost certainly would not have been used to store 2 gigabytes of pornography had it not been . To use Roberts ' analogy , it is as if the MTA employee had turned his office into a library and invited the public to use the high-speed elevator in the back to gain access . Several people said that security is strictly the responsibility of the individual computer sites and not of the network itself . Clearly , though , the growing speed and reach of the Internet makes site security on Net-linked systems much more problematic . In future stories , The Cutting Edge will explore the practical , day-to-day problems of managing Net-linked computers . We are always interested in suggestions -- from both the Internet-literate and those who aren ' t yet on-line -- on how to improve our coverage of the Internet and other complex technology issues .
