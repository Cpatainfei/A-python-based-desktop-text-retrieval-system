   <HEADLINE> NO LONGER TOO SOFT ON TERRORISTS ; FBI ' S FREEH PROPOSES BOLD NEW STEPS TO DETECT AND DETER ' UNDESIRABLE ALIENS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Terrorism within the United States became a frightening reality with last year ' s bombing of the World Trade Center in New York . That incident was linked to individuals who had entered the country under questionable visa status . Now , as part of an intensified effort to curb terrorism , FBI Director Louis J . Freeh is calling_for closing loopholes in U.S. immigration policies and practices , including the tightening of controls on student visas and sham marriages between U.S. citizens and foreigners . Certainly terrorism is not necessarily a &quot; foreign &quot; activity , and aliens regardless of status should not be unlawfully harassed . But safeguards need to be considered to make the nation less vulnerable to terrorism . According to a report by Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow , Freeh made the recommendations in response to the Justice_Department ' s request for a review of immigration policies and practices in the wake of the New York bombing and a 1993 assault-rifle attack that killed five people outside CIA headquarters in Langley , Va . Freeh proposed strengthening investigative powers against suspected &quot; undesirable aliens , &quot; accelerating deportation appeal proceedings and limiting U.S. participation in a visa waiver pilot_program under which 9.5 million foreigners entered the country in fiscal 1994 . Freeh said requests for asylum have become &quot; one of the easiest ways to enter and remain &quot; in the United States for those intent_on engaging in illegal conduct . Current procedures call_for only the posting of a small bond guaranteeing appearance at a future hearing or release on one ' s own recognizance . Too often , asylum-seeking aliens never show_up for their hearings . Freeh advocated provisions for detention and deportation of those asylum seekers who skirt the law . The two other categories of abuse are student visas and sham marriages . Students often do not abide_by the terms of their study visas and marriages to American citizens are sometimes intended merely to gain legal residency . The Justice_Department is reviewing Freeh ' s recommendations . The United States has long maintained a policy of being as open as possible . That has been a way of refreshing the nation . But abuse of national generosity to carry_out ulterior motives , especially terrorism , is not to tolerated . Freeh ' s recommendations are directed toward taking preventive measures to weed out possible terrorists . The FBI director ' s ideas warrant thoughtful consideration ; America must do a better job at warding_off terrorism .</TEXT>
