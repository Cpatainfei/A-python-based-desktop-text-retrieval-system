   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; A DACHA DUEL IN CRIMEA BETWEEN RUSSIA , UKRAINE ; UNDER COVER OF POLITICAL CHAOS , A LAND GRAB RAGES IN SEVASTOPOL , HOME OF THE BLACK_SEA FLEET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sailboat bobs on the gentle tide of Sevastopol ' s Azure Bay , a sea_gull soaring against the setting sun . It is a picture of tranquillity , an imaginary scene painted on an admiral ' s house . The reality of the atmosphere in this historic naval port on the Crimean peninsula is heated , a conflict between Ukraine and Russia over who owns what , including Sevastopol . &quot; This dacha belongs_to the former commander of the Black_Sea Fleet , Adm . Mikhail Khronopulov , &quot; explained Boris Nesterenko , a retired officer , as he admired the spacious three-story house . Five other big dachas shared the bluff overlooking the bay . &quot; Rumor has it that the deputy commander of Russia ' s Pacific Fleet owns one of them , &quot; Nesterenko said . &quot; Naval officers from throughout the ( former ) U.S.S.R. have built dachas here. &quot; In the hierarchy of military dachas , size reflects rank . So , junior officers in the 81st Marine Brigade , stationed just minutes away from Khronopulov ' s exclusive enclave , rate only tiny cottages crammed into a field outside their base . &quot; Those weren ' t there a year ago , &quot; Nesterenko said . &quot; But in the last two years , the military has been exploiting the political chaos to seize city land for itself. &quot; This is Ukraine , but the military here is mainly Russian . With the conflict over political control of Sevastopol heating_up , the &quot; dacha factor &quot; may make_it impossible to settle . Despite the picturesque cliffs and seaside location , the marines ' dacha community is no Malibu . But for their owners , the cottages are all that they can call home . Their forces nearly tripled from 800 in 1992 to 2 # 200 today , the elite marines are reportedly preparing_for what many here call the Third Defense of Sevastopol . The First Defense of the strategic port was against England , France and Turkey in the Crimean War . The second , against Nazi Germany . Today , the enemy is Ukraine . &quot; Those boys are being trained to hate Ukraine , &quot; Nesterenko said . &quot; And they will kill for their dachas . &quot; For the generals and politicians in Kiev and Moscow , the two-year custody_battle over the Soviet naval force in the Black_Sea is a geopolitical problem . &quot; Whoever controls the fleet controls Sevastopol , and whoever controls Sevastopol will control Crimea , &quot; said Capt . Akhmet Aivazov , a Crimean Tatar serving in Ukraine ' s nascent naval force . With only four ships , the Ukrainian navy is not much of a force , and it is an uneasy neighbor to the hundreds of Black_Sea Fleet warships in Sevastopol ' s South Bay . In theory , those ships are jointly commanded by Ukraine ' s President Leonid Kravchuk and Russia ' s Boris N . Yeltsin . In practice , however , Moscow calls the shots and some officers have already sewed the insignia of Russia ' s armed forces on their uniforms . Ships are a different matter . Under an accord reached last month , Ukraine would have gotten 164 of the Black_Sea Fleet ' s 833 ships -- about what it needs , according to naval_officers . Russia would have taken the rest . Talks broke_down , however , when both sides insisted on basing their navies in Sevastopol . Ukraine suggested that the Crimean port of Donuzlav about 30 miles north of Sevastopol would be a splendid base for the Russians . The latter countered that Sevastopol suits them fine and suggested Ukraine ship its navy to Odessa , west of Crimea . Ask any sailor in Sevastopol about the future of the Black_Sea Fleet and he ' ll talk_about his home . Capt . Sergei Zinchenko , a 32-year-old patrol_boat commander born and bred in Sevastopol , has no intention of leaving . &quot; Where am I to go ? &quot; he asked . &quot; My family , my home is here. &quot; Even the less fortunate , who are still on waiting lists for government-issued apartments , have a lot to lose . If they move to a different city , they must go_back to the end of the line . Housing is not just a problem for the Black_Sea Fleet and its Russian sailors . Sevastopol-based officers who swore loyalty to Ukraine and transferred to its navy are also tied to the city by apartments and dachas . &quot; If Russia forces us out of Sevastopol , those officers will have to abandon their homes , &quot; said Oleh Chybuk , a spokesman for the Ukrainian navy . In the improbable event that Moscow ' s portion of the Black_Sea Fleet was forced to set sail for naval bases in frigid Murmansk or Vladivostok , serving in the Russian navy would be less attractive . But sunny Sevastopol has always been considered a plum posting . The natural beauty and Mediterranean climate of the &quot; Crimean Riviera , &quot; the Soviet_Union ' s summer fun playground , with its mountains , beaches and wineries , are just an hour ' s drive_away . Secret cities hide inside Sevastopol like Matrioshka dolls . Even the dachas overlooking the Azure Bay conceal a subterranean city below their basements , a World_War_II command_post massive enough to house 70 # 000 soldiers and underground airplane hangars . Not all_of Sevastopol ' s secrets are buried underground . A Byzantine cave monastery carved out of sandstone cliffs village awaits . And the ruins of Chersonesus Taurica , the first city to arise on this jagged corner of Crimea ' s coast , are fenced off from modern Sevastopol in a huge preserve . Today , Sevastopol residents picnic and sunbathe amid its excavated ruins in the summertime , inspiring one wistful visitor to scribble : &quot; I so want to return here &quot; on a column in one of the Byzantine basilicas . The Sevastopol lifestyle has its downside . The city is expensive . Water , manufactured goods , bread , meat , electricity -- nearly everything except produce , wine and fish -- are shipped from the Ukrainian mainland at subsidized but still high prices . So , when locals chant the famous phrase : &quot; Sevastopol is the city of Russian glory , &quot; Kiev retorts : &quot; Sevastopol is a city of Ukrainian subsidies , &quot; siphoning more per capita spending out of the Ukrainian budget than any other city . But the bottom_line is not persuasive in a city that never had to balance its own books . A June 26 plebiscite among Sevastopol residents declaring the city to be &quot; the main naval base for the Russian Black_Sea Fleet &quot; is widely expected to pass . And Friday the Crimean parliament declared the peninsula independent of Ukraine , a move the Ukranian government promptly rejected . &quot; Ukraine should have insisted on dividing the fleet two years ago , &quot; said Boris Nesterenko as he contemplated the hundreds of dachas , crowned with Mediterranean red tile , dotting the_hills around Sevastopol ' s South Bay . &quot; Russia will never leave now , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
