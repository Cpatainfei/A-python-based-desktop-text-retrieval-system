   <HEADLINE> HAITI ' S PARLIAMENT OKS AMNESTY , PAVING THE WAY FOR ARISTIDE ' S RETURN ; CARIBBEAN : THE 9-TO-1 VOTE BY THE SENATE TURNS UP THE PRESSURE ON CEDRAS TO STEP_DOWN . THE DECISION IS A FACE-SAVING DEVICE FOR LEADERS OF THE JUNTA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Haitian Senate hastily approved an expansion of the nation ' s amnesty law Friday , increasing pressure on army chief Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras to resign and paving the way for the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . In a deal with the United States , Cedras had pledged to leave if Parliament approved a general amnesty or by Oct . 15 , whichever came first . A copy of the provision was sent by fax to Aristide for his signature , and it will become law when it is published here Monday . The measure allows the ousted president to pardon the generals who overthrew him not only for political misdeeds but for other crimes . The lower chamber of Parliament overwhelmingly approved the amendment to an existing amnesty law on Thursday . Senior U.S. officials said they were examining whether the measure meets the requirements of the Sept . 18 U.S.-Haitian agreement that was to culminate with Cedras ' resignation . It also wasn ' t known if Cedras considered the bill the general amnesty he had sought . But a source close to Cedras , speaking on condition of anonymity , did not believe the Parliament had approved a general amnesty . Haitian senators said they hoped their vote would give Cedras one less excuse for holding onto power . The United States had strongly supported an amnesty for military_leaders despite concern that Aristide might not proclaim it . His supporters have called_for &quot; justice &quot; for political and human_rights crimes by the military . &quot; What this bill does . . . is throw the ball back to President Aristide , &quot; U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said . Displaying increasing defiance of the military , about 5 # 000 pro-democracy Haitians marched Friday to army headquarters to demand that Cedras leave . The rally was the first at the headquarters . &quot; Down with Cedras ! We hate Cedras ! &quot; they jeered , increasing the pressure on Cedras to not only step_down from power , but to leave Haiti . Cedras has said he won ' t leave the country , as Aristide demands . Cedras was not inside the white-and-yellow building . But some of his top commanders watched from a second-floor balcony , including Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , who like Cedras must leave power by the end of next week . Demonstrators stuffed a pair of blue_jeans with foam_rubber and spanked it with branches -- a surrogate for Cedras and the once-dreaded police_chief Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , who fled to the Dominican_Republic on Tuesday . The demonstration coincided with the visit of Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott to discuss the transition from military to civilian government . After less than an hour of discussion , the Senate voted 9 to 1 to give Aristide the authority to grant an amnesty . Approval quickly followed on two minor amendments related to amnesty . &quot; We are voting to get_out the confusion , not because of the pressure from the ( American ) troops here , &quot; said Sen . Clark Parent , an Aristide supporter who came_out of hiding from the military to cast his vote . American soldiers guarded the seaside Legislative Palace . Senators emphasized that the agreement would not stop individuals from suing their tormentors in court for human_rights violations committed since the military seized power three years ago . Thousands of people have been killed since then . &quot; I hope ( Cedras and Biamby ) will do their part &quot; by leaving , said Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis . &quot; I hope the gesture will come_in the upcoming days or the upcoming hours. &quot; Jean-Claude Roy , a conservative politician and friend of Cedras , criticized the measure . He said it &quot; offers guidelines for Aristide only if Aristide does indeed keep his word and grant an amnesty. &quot; There were further signs , meanwhile , of the opposition wobbling to its feet after three years of military rule . The pro-Aristide National Congress for Democratic Movements met Friday , holding its most open meeting in three years , said Eddy Jean Claude , a member of the party ' s directorate . &quot; But we still have fear , &quot; he added . Paramilitary violence continued in Cite Soleil , a pro-Aristide stronghold and one of the capital ' s worst slums , but the U.S. military said American troops were not deployed there . About 50 people gathered early Friday around the hacked body of a bus_driver , reportedly killed by pro-military attaches the night before . Such killings are common in Cite Soleil . A cousin of the victim , identified only as Emmanuel , said he had seen half_a_dozen men chasing Emmanuel the night before and recognized one as a member of the paramilitary Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti , or FRAPH . Neighbors and relatives said American military patrols could have prevented the killing . &quot; The Americans don ' t come_through here , &quot; said one woman . &quot; Why don ' t they come ? &quot; U.S. Army spokesman Col . Barry Willey said the U.S. force was aware that Cite Soleil &quot; is a politically sensitive area , but we have a lot of areas that we could potentially patrol and that we are patrolling. &quot;</TEXT>
