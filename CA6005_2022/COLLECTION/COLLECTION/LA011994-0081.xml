   <HEADLINE> MCDOWELL ASKING FOR $ 6.5 MILLION ; BASEBALL : WHITE SOX TALK TRADE WITH YANKEES FOR CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER , WHO LEADS ARBITRATION PARADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Chicago White Sox are secretly negotiating with the New York Yankees in an attempt to trade Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell , but in the meantime , they may soon make him the highest-paid pitcher in baseball . McDowell asked the Chicago White Sox for a record $ 6.5 million Tuesday when players and teams exchanged salary arbitration numbers . If McDowell goes_to arbitration and wins , he will receive the highest salary for a pitcher in a single season . Even if he loses , the $ 5.3 million offered by the White Sox will be the highest award in the history of the process . Still , having to go_to arbitration for a third consecutive year has McDowell believing his relationship with the White Sox may soon end . &quot; The thing that ' s getting old is not being appreciated , &quot; said Jim McDowell , Jack ' s brother and agent . &quot; That would be nice , instead of having a club bicker over every_last dollar year after year . . . . I mean , you ' d think that 20-win seasons and a Cy Young would mean something. &quot; McDowell led a record group of 16 players seeking at least $ 3.9 million in arbitration , including Atlanta outfielder Ron Gant , who requested $ 6 million . Of the 80 players who traded figures , 59 are seeking at least $ 1 million . Only two players were offered cuts by their teams -- Cincinnati relief_pitcher Rob Dibble and Montreal infielder Randy Milligan . Dodger pitchers Kevin Gross and Ramon Martinez asked_for $ 3 million and $ 2.9 million , respectively . The Dodgers offered Martinez $ 2.475 million , the most they have offered in arbitration , and Gross $ 2.4 million . &quot; My hope is to resolve the two cases and not go_to arbitration , &quot; said Dodger General_Manager Fred Claire , who spent several hours in negotiations Tuesday with Mike Piazza , the National League ' s rookie of the year . Although most arbitration cases are resolved without a hearing , there are several that may be difficult this year . Juan Gonzalez , who led the American League with 46 home_runs , was offered $ 3 million by Texas , $ 1.9 million less than he asked . Philadelphia pitcher Curt Schilling , the most_valuable_player in the National League playoffs , asked_for $ 3.2 million and was offered $ 2 million . The Angels had no players who exchanged arbitration figures .</TEXT>
