   <HEADLINE> WALL GONE , BERLIN ' S FREEDOM PAINS ; GERMANY : FIVE YEARS LATER , CONSTRUCTION CRANES SILHOUETTE THE SKYLINE . BUT DANGER UNKNOWN IN COLD_WAR DAYS LURKS BY NIGHT , WITH ROBBERY AND MURDER ON THE RISE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; You ' ve learned what freedom is . Don ' t forget it. &quot; The artist ' s inscription appears on the longest stretch of the Berlin Wall still standing -- a 1.3-mile collection of murals . Five years after the Wall opened , the city that once symbolized the divide between Western democracy and Soviet autocracy has learned freedom is a messy chore . Construction cranes 20 stories high now silhouette Berlin ' s skyline . But danger unknown in Cold_War days lurks by night , with robbery and murder on the rise . A bicycle tour along the wall ' s former route tells the story of a city in flux . The &quot; East_Side Gallery &quot; of murals and slogans on the Wall section has lost its luster . Paint is chipping . Graffiti mocks the art . Nearby is a BMW dealership , its shiny symbols of west German manufacturing prowess parked against a background of prefabricated , Communist-era apartment_houses . The East_German everyman ' s car , the two-stroke Trabant , is all but gone . But easterners couldn ' t trade_in their drab apartments or save jobs in closed factories . Some 175 # 000 east_Germans now work in west_Berlin , compared to 20 # 000 west_Berliners commuting to jobs in former east_Germany . Behind the East_Side Gallery , on the Spree River ' s eastern bank , a_few hundred squatters live_in ramshackle trailers , tolerated by the same city officials who evicted them from the Kreuzberg district three years ago . Across the river is Kreuzberg , once a low-rent western district in the Wall ' s shadow . Now it borders a booming city_center and property values have shot_up . &quot; A lot of penthouse apartments around here were refurbished and are standing empty because the prices are too high , &quot; said Oliver Schattel , who helps run a small farm that Kreuzberg squatters started along the wall_in 1980 . City officials want to bulldoze the farm . In 1993 , the yuppie influx prompted Kreuzberg extremists to bomb an upscale delicatessen and a_few developers ' luxury cars . Cars sometimes seem useless in the city of 3.47 million people . Traffic crawls as streets are torn_up and rebuilt , subway lines renovated , long-severed bridge and rail links re-established . About $ 30 billion in building projects are in the works , most slated for completion by 2000 , when the government ' s move from Bonn should be in_full_swing . Russian and Allied soldiers left Berlin last fall , and as they moved_out , the world moved_in . Eastern Europeans account_for most of the 25 % rise to 395 # 000 foreign residents since 1989 . Some of the new arrivals are burglars and car thieves blamed for much of an alarming rise in crime . Murder and attempted murder nearly doubled to 735 cases in Berlin in 1993 from 1992 . Police say Russian mobsters are a key factor .</TEXT>
