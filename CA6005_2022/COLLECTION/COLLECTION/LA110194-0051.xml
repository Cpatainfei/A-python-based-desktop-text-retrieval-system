   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; LIFE WHERE THE CURTAIN PARTED ; AT BORDER OF AUSTRIA AND HUNGARY WHERE EAST-WEST BARRIER WAS FIRST BREACHED , DREAMS ARE PANNING_OUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For much of Europe , the collapse of the Iron_Curtain has been a mixed blessing -- a paradoxical blend of soaring hope and crushing disappointment . Not so here . Along the Austrian-Hungarian frontier that once separated the Communist , totalitarian East from the democratic , free-market West , there is little argument : Life is decidedly better . Here , in this small Hungarian town and the Austrian farming village of Nickelsdorf three miles west across a mix of corn and potato fields , dreams are panning_out . The two communities , which for 40 years existed as isolated outposts in their respective political worlds , today find themselves at the center of a new Europe -- much as their respective mayors had predicted in interviews during the summer of 1989 . Whiffs of change were in the air back then , but no one went so far as_to talk_of revolution , and no one thought_of communism ' s imminent demise . Not even when the media converged on the area briefly to watch Hungarian soldiers tear out the first small section of the Iron_Curtain did predictions go that far . After all , Solidarity ' s stunning election victory in Poland was still a month away , the collapse of the Berlin Wall merely a vague hope . The fact that , within 2 1 / 2 years , Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev and then the Soviet_Union itself would disappear , was simply inconceivable in those first days of the summer of 1989 . Today , life along the old East-West divide thrives in a very different world -- a world where a dangerous but stable superpower rivalry has gone , where only the United States exercises a genuine global role and where a new Russia struggles to define its place and its interests . &quot; We haven ' t developed as much in our entire history as we have in the past five years , &quot; noted Hegyeshalom ' s mayor , Zoltan Vincze . He reeled_off a list of accomplishments that began with a new indoor sports hall and leisure center and ran_through the extension to the water_system , new gas connections , a cable TV system , improved street lighting , a doubling of the number of telephones , renovation of the dentist ' s office and the arrival of a second doctor in this town of about 4 # 000 . &quot; For the first time , we have a pediatrician here , &quot; he said , pausing briefly for effect . &quot; Things have really turned_out well. &quot; Nearly half the town ' s state-owned land has been privatized , 10 new grocery_stores have opened , unemployment is steady at 4 % to 5 % , several homes have been repainted , the church has a new roof and when Vincze makes his rounds , he no longer drives a Russian-made Lada but a Peugeot 305 . Across the frontier in Nickelsdorf , it ' s also been a good five years . In the summer of ' 89 , as Europe edged toward the brink , Mayor Gerhard Jocham saw the political liberalization in Hungary and Poland as a chance to breathe new life into his isolated village . With luck , he said then , the exodus of young people that had drained the community of nearly half its population during the Cold_War years might even be stemmed . Today , Nickelsdorf ' s population has not only stabilized , it ' s beginning to grow . Just off the village square in a tiny office crammed with official keepsakes and souvenirs , Jocham lists the prospects : 18 jobs at two filling stations about to open_up on the new four-lane highway connecting Vienna and Budapest , a number of other jobs at a rest-stop hotel and still more at a 27-acre commercial park that will be built nearby . &quot; We ' re hoping to have 2 # 000 people living here by the turn_of_the_century , &quot; he said . Such a figure would be a 20 % jump over 1989 . With Austria set to join the European Union in January and Hungary having already formally applied , the border region ' s future seems brighter still . &quot; If Hungary comes_in , we ' ll be in the middle of the world ' s richest market , &quot; he said . &quot; Then , who knows ? &quot; Much progress is already visible . Last week , the final Austrian section of the Vienna-Budapest highway was opened_to traffic , and work_on the Hungarian side is scheduled for completion in June . The streets of Nickelsdorf are also under construction , ripped open for the upgraded sewage_system needed to accommodate the new hotel and commercial park . Local officials expect work to start soon on new low-cost housing and upgraded shopping facilities , including a supermarket , drugstore and furniture outlet . &quot; At first , people are going_to commute , but we want to give them a chance to live here too , &quot; Jocham said . To be sure , life hasn ' t been all smooth sailing along this old Cold_War frontier . Hungarian skilled laborers willing to work illegally for a quarter the salary of their Austrian counterparts have eased unemployment in Hungary and lowered construction costs in eastern Austria , but they have also angered local workers and their union executives . There have also been disappointments . A shopping arcade on the Hungarian side just off the Vienna-Budapest highway that was once seen as a key money-earner for Hegyeshalom has been plagued with problems . Its original developers went broke last year , and with capital extremely short in Hungary , the venture was sold to a group of Libyans . The new owners talk_of expanding the arcade , adding stores and paving the dirt parking_lot , but local officials still aren ' t happy . They have a hunch the Libyans are using the arcade only as a money-laundering operation for more dubious business_activities elsewhere . Local officials also worry about the social costs of restructuring the town ' s economy away from the stone quarry and railway that sustained it through the Communist era . &quot; It ' s been like someone threw a light on after living 40 years in the dark , &quot; Vincze said . &quot; It ' s been blinding . We ' ve suddenly moved_into a new age of technology , and the semi-skilled workers over 40 simply can ' t deal with it . We thought we ' d get more help , but we didn ' t . We ' ve learned that you have to help yourself. &quot; Vincze , whose years as mayor span Hungary ' s transition to a multi-party democracy , also laments a gap of individual initiative between Hungarians and Austrians . &quot; You ' ve heard about the differences between East and West Germans ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Well , here it ' s worse . It ' s the generations grown under communism . You ' ve got_to push , push and push some more. &quot; Whatever the coming years bring for the two communities , it will be tough to top the last five . For both communities , the changes really began during the spring of 1989 , when tens of thousands of Hungarians armed with special visas and enough hard currency to do some serious buying crossed into Austria and bought just about every television_set , video recorder and microwave_oven east of Vienna . A few weeks later , the reformist Hungarian Communist government decided the Iron_Curtain was out of date . It ordered troops in to roll_up the barbed wire , dismantle the watchtowers and end the armed patrols . It would be summer before the first East_Germans vacationing in Hungary realized that they could reach the West by simply walking through these open fields , but once they did , the Berlin Wall would quickly fall . In that hectic summer , Nickelsdorf became a boom_town of sorts . With a population of 1 # 650 , it sported no fewer than 28 stores catering to Hungarian day-trippers , selling consumer_durables from TV_sets to washing_machines . &quot; Two for us , 26 for the Hungarians , &quot; Jocham joked at the time . Today , with the Hungarian demand satiated and money tight , three such shops remain . &quot; We get some Hungarians in here , but the big rush is gone , &quot; said an assistant at one of the stores on Lower Main_Street . At the Weiss grocery_store a_few doors down , customers still recall the out-of-towners who came_in that summer to open large electronics stores along the main_drag . &quot; One of ' em spent 5 million schillings ( $ 500 # 000 ) for a place_down there on the corner , but he was too late , &quot; an elderly customer named Schmidt recalled . &quot; He missed the wave and went broke within a year. &quot; Few in Nickelsdorf seem to lament the passing of the boom . Even fewer miss the traffic that tied the village in knots . Today , it is as if the Iron_Curtain had never been . There is no monument , no reminder , no real trace of Europe ' s great scar . Just two mundane border stakes and a roughly cut strip of brown grass mark the line of the infamous barrier that divided the world into opposing armed camps for more_than four decades . It is a twist of history as well as a sign of new times that a watchtower recently sprung_up on the Austrian side to help Austrian army patrols spot immigrants trying to slip into the country illegally . But little stirs here , and amid the quiet of a mid-autumn afternoon , only one sound rises from the distance : the sound of heavy trucks moving east and west along the nearby highway . Eastern European Economies One way to measure economic reform in Eastern Europe is by the percentage of gross_national_product ( GNP ) contributed by private enterprise . Figures shown are estimates . Private Sector Share of GNP ( mid-1994 ) Albania : 60 % Bulgaria : 40 Croatia : 40 Czech Republic : 65 Macedonia : 35 Hungary : 55 Poland : 55 Romania : 35 Slovakia : 55 Slovenia : 30 Source : European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development</TEXT>
