   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; ERNESTO ZEDILLO ; CUTTING A NEW PATH THROUGH MEXICO ' S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One month after the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , Mexico ' s mood is somber . Across the country , black ribbons still bedeck the giant billboards that urge voters to support Colosio . But Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , new candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , is already in full campaign mode -- address ing workers in cavernous halls , walking crowded subway platforms to shake hands , talking with constituents in small neighborhood meetings . Zedillo was born in 1951 , in Mexico_City , but was raised in Mexicali , Baja California . Life in that border city was not easy for the Zedillo family . They were extremely poor . Yet , young Ernesto excelled in school , and his straight A ' s secured him a college education , then graduate studies at Bradford University in Britain and , finally , a doctorate at Yale . Married to Nidia Patricia Velazco , Zedillo is the father of five children . Recognized as a brilliant economist , Zedillo was chosen by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to succeed Colosio -- despite the reservations expressed by many political observers about his limited political experience . Zedillo is the first to admit his candidacy is the result of tragic circumstances . He has no doubt , however , that he is ready to manage a country confronting a severe political crisis -- including an armed insurrection in Chiapas and its first major political assassination in more_than six decades . By choosing Zedillo , Salinas sends a powerful message that the economic model the country has followed since the presidency of Miguel de la Madrid , in 1982 , will remain in place . The challenges Zedillo face seem overwhelming . Politically , he must persuade his party that he can win the Aug . 21 election . If he does win , he must persuade the public that he won fair and square . Then , as president , Zedillo wants to reform the justice system , to reassure the country that Mexico will remain stable and peaceful . He also must start showing the nation that the time to reap the benefits of economic reform -- initiated in 1982 , after the collapse of oil prices precipitated an economic_crisis -- has arrived . His success will be measured by the rise in per capita income of Mexican households . That , in turn , may give Zedillo the support necessary to tackle the long-delayed political reform vital to Mexico ' s modernization . Question : Mexico seems overwhelmed with mourning due_to the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio . What do you feel about it ? Answer : This is an unknown and dramatic experience we thought only happened in other countries -- not here . Mexico has had social peace for many decades . This has created an enormous amount of affliction and uncertainty -- but it has also generated a sense of national unity and ( desire ) for peace . This was a crime committed not only against one person , but against the nation . We all are hurt by it , and we will suffer the consequences of this terrible act for many years to come . Q : Many people have criticized the way you handled Colosio ' s campaign . Is this a fair criticism ? A : The situation in which the campaign evolved in the first three months was difficult . Chiapas changed the framework of reference that we had envisioned for the campaign . I feel that Luis Donaldo Colosio ' s campaign was good -- not because of me , but because he was responsible_for giving us the larger themes . He was a party_man who had managed many political_campaigns , and the one he made_for himself was the best -- given the circumstances in the country . Q : Is this the most critical moment in Mexico ' s history after the revolution ? A : No . Obviously , I feel it is a difficult moment because incidents have occurred Sergio Munoz is the editor of Nuestro Tiempo , The Times ' weekly Spanish-language edition . that are new in Mexico ' s modern history -- the Chiapas question and Colosio ' s assassination . It is atrocious . But I feel that the country ' s basic structure and the people ' s capacity to resolve problems is enormous . On the contrary , I am very optimistic . I believe these incidents reflect the actions of a very small minority and shouldn ' t be used to judge the strength of a country like Mexico . Q : Do you possess the political experience necessary to lead the country in this moment of crisis ? A : Look , I will let results speak_for themselves . I think that I have the experience and the capacity to come_through for my party . Don ' t forget that I am the first presidential candidate in many years who has been secretary of two Cabinet posts ( budget and planning and education ) in the federal_government . The truth , in all modesty , is that there is no contender to the republican presidency with my experience . The facts speak_for themselves . Q : What is your platform ? A : First of all , we Mexicans must recognize our strengths and our capacities as well as our problems . Granted that we Mexicans will continue to defend and strengthen our sovereignty ; this is very important and is not up for discussion . But then there are the problems of insecurity and injustice , unemployment , insufficient income for the working class , and poverty and inequality . My proposal is an integral strategy which will attack these problems simultaneously from four different fronts . Regarding justice and democracy , we should strengthen the validity of the law in Mexico -- a problem that ranges from unjust laws to unjust judges . We seek to solve the problems regarding the procurement of justice . We must preserve and consolidate the stability of our economy . The answer to our problems won ' t come from lack of financial discipline . We won ' t find it by returning to budgetary deficits or to high inflation_rates . To achieve economic development , it is mandatory to have economic stability . Then we must improve productivity and efficiency . It is true that we have made macroeconomic advances . Now we must work hard at the microeconomic . We have to strengthen productivity in the workers and businesses . We must achieve a rapid technological actualization ; train the workers as well as the companies ; achieve a competitive condition in the input factors used by the Mexican enterprises ; continue to streamline all_of those aspects that affect the investment and the efficiency of workers and companies . Last , but not least , is my social_policy . This is what I place the most importance upon . We have to invest in people , break the vicious_circle of poverty and incorporate millions of Mexicans into the modern sectors of the economy . This is my simple proposal : to achieve economic_growth with a more favorable income distribution that will translate into an improved benefit for families . The most powerful point in my campaign is the Mexican family ' s well-being . Q : If you win , what would you do differently from the Salinas Administration ? A : Granted that we will maintain our financial discipline , I feel that , in the next few years , we must emphasize the issues of justice and democracy . The truth , with all due respect , is that the people , especially the most humble people , don ' t feel the law is_on their side . The people fear the police , they fear the justice_department , the judges . . . . There are matters of discrimination ; I mention the case of women . We have not only discriminatory laws against women in Mexico , but even the existing laws that protect them are , at times , not carried_out . Therefore , we must bring into effect what is written in article 4 of the constitution -- that men and women are equal in the face of the law . Q : But would you tell the people : ' I understand your frustration with the economic_policies in place since 1982 , but you can expect that things will get better ' ? A : I think that we have a well-founded belief in Mexico that the sacrifices we have made these years , under President Salinas , have allowed us to now have an extraordinary base for Mexico to develop in the coming years . So that Mexico may grow and , above all , have a structure that will benefit us in the next few years with a better distribution of income . We must emphasize microeconomics , as it has not been done these past few years but which will be the challenge in the upcoming years . We have the economic possibilities of having a much more ambitious social_policy than what we have had up until today -- if we do not erase our advances . We cannot afford to go_back to populism , paternalism or statism . Q : How do you see Chiapas now ? A : There has been great progress since January . I was very encouraged by Manuel Camacho ' s call last week in response to the attack on a military_post . It seems there has been a positive response and soon dialogue will be re-established . I believe the problem will be peacefully resolved , because there is good_faith on the part of the government to reach a civilized solution , and now we see there is also good_faith on the other side . Q : Some of the criticism heard about your party is there is no accountability -- that there are many electoral irregularities and yet nobody is ever punished publicly . A : There was a flaw in our legislation . The crimes related to electoral issues were not aptly classified nor were the penalties . There now exists a classification of electoral crimes and the stipulation of the penalties in the penal_code . Now we must make_sure that all those who break the law receive the corresponding penalty . Now I feel we have a modern electoral framework . We have electoral institutions that are extremely refined in their procedures . We are_on the way to another electoral reform . The constitution was just amended to guarantee the autonomy of the electoral institutions and , in the coming days , Congress will surely be discussing additional reforms . . . . Q : Your party is divided . A : Says who ? Q : The entire world . A : That is not true ! Only a_few people who are outside of my party say so . Q : But I have heard criticism by the PRI old_guard against President Salinas and by the young generation of Priistas , for whom &quot; business-as-usual &quot; is a repugnant practice . Don ' t you believe that political reform in Mexico lags way behind ? A : Well , now you are mixing several topics . In the first place , I don ' t believe my party is divided . Being a broad center party -- a characteristic unknown to any other party here in Mexico -- it embraces a diversity of opinions . It is a very myopic commentary to say , because there are different opinions among the members of my party , that the party is divided . No . Diversity of opinions and the construction of a consensus are precisely what we Priistas strive for . The diversity of opinions is one manifestation of the political strength of our party . We are not a monolithic , authoritarian party where all must share the same opinion . Those who claim that our party is divided , and point to our problems , should concern themselves with their own party . The matters of the PRI are the concern of Priistas . Q : So , you don ' t think that political reform has been forgotten in Mexico ? A : President Salinas has made an extraordinary effort to modernize the country on all grounds . In the political realm lie all_the facts . There were three great electoral reforms during his term . He has promoted democracy from the grass roots of society by calling to all Mexicans for an enormous social participation . Democracy transcends the electoral process . He has promoted a larger democratization of the country . He has made his best effort , given the circumstances . But it is clear that we must still work hard to achieve the kind of democracy that will appease the Mexican people ' s call_for democracy . Q : Does the PRI have to separate from the government ? A : Well , the constitution is clear ; it establishes the government ' s functions and what defines a political_party : public- interest organizations to promote the political participation of the citizens . Therefore , what we need to do is follow_through with what the constitution has already established . Q : How do you see the future between Mexico and the United States under the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ? A : I hope to have a relationship of mutual respect . I hope they realize that Mexico has firm and clear foreign-policy principles and that those principles are necessary to uphold an amicable and cooperative relationship . In order for the free-trade agreement to function , we need to work_at it . We must dispel this environment of uncertainty that has developed in these months . I am sure this will be dissipated soon and that both countries can take_advantage of the immense opportunities that the free-trade agreement promises. *</TEXT>
