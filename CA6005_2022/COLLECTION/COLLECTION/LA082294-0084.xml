   <HEADLINE> DECISION IN MEXICO ; TIJUANA VOTERS RECALL ASSASSINATED CANDIDATE ; BAJA CALIFORNIA : STATE HAS SUFFERED RECENT VIOLENCE , BUT ELECTION_DAY IS PEACEFUL AND TURNOUT IS HIGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Lomas Taurinas neighborhood sprawls across an urban canyon , a natural amphitheater that was the stage for the crime that changed Mexican history in March -- and cast a shadow over the presidential election Sunday . Five months after an assassin emerged from a crowd in a dirt plaza here and gunned_down ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , Lomas Taurinas confronted history again . Solemn voters lined_up at outdoor polling_places in a dusty , impoverished landscape dominated by tributes to the fallen Colosio : signs , a larger-than-life statue , a shrine marking the murder scene . &quot; With all my heart , I wanted him to win , &quot; said Emilia Arangure , an elderly woman dressed in black who stopped at the shrine to kneel in prayer . &quot; Unfortunately , death came first . I came_to vote for him in spirit. &quot; Also paying her respects was Maria Teresa Asencio , a 20-year-old landscaper , who recalled how on March 23 she shook Colosio ' s hand at the fateful campaign rally , then later watched in shock when he was brought_down by two gunshots . Like many residents of this neighborhood , a stronghold of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , Asencio said she voted for Colosio ' s replacement , Ernesto Zedillo , describing him as the candidate most capable of fighting crime . &quot; I feel the most secure with him , &quot; Asencio said . Politically charged violence has created fear and uncertainty in Baja California . In addition to the Colosio assassination , Baja has been hit by the ambush murder of the Tijuana police_chief and shootouts and scandals involving drug lords and corrupt police . Nonetheless , the crisis does not typify life in the border state , and election_day appeared to be shaping_up as peaceful , if occasionally disorganized . Baja ' s well-educated , civically active population has consistently registered the highest voter_turnout levels in the nation : almost 80 % in local elections in 1992 . Compared to rural regions where PRI domination produces apathy , vote fraud and election-related strife , Baja ' s political culture has grown more democratic after five years of rule by the opposition National Action Party ( PAN ) . &quot; We are advanced in the culture of political tolerance , &quot; said Tijuana Mayor Hector Osuna Jaime , a member of PAN . &quot; We are accustomed to the alternation of power , to different political_parties in the government. &quot; The question Sunday was whether the opposition would finally wrest the presidency away from the PRI -- and what role this small but crucial state would play in the struggle . All three candidates are considered competitive here . Although the Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is much stronger to the south , Cardenas won Baja in his 1988 presidential bid . Zedillo , who during campaign visits reminded audiences that he grew_up in Mexicali , has led polls conducted locally . As for Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , he has drawn_on the PAN ' s historical base of support along the length of the urban , independent-minded border area . &quot; I think there could be a surprise , &quot; said Jorge Perez , a Lomas Taurinas factory_worker , who said he planned to vote for Fernandez . &quot; Zedillo doesn ' t convince me . Diego has more character. &quot; Perez was interviewed as he watched churchgoers crossing a tattered bridge to the polling_station in front of a row of multicolored shops . They lined_up silently , intent_on the voting ritual , taking refuge from the sun beating_down on the plaza where bulldozers had been hard at_work on a new park in recent weeks . Some residents dismissed the project as an unsubtle effort by the government to win votes for the PRI . Elsewhere in Tijuana , government officials and election observers reported no major incidents or problems at the majority of polling_places . The most common complaint was the failure of some election officials to begin the voting on_time . In addition , an observer working for the state human_rights commission said he had observed some breakdowns in the much-publicized security measures promised by the government . For example , a late start caused some officials to neglect to sign the ballot forms as required and others did not check the thumbs of voters for the indelible_ink indicating they had already cast ballots , said the observer , who asked not to be identified . The most urgent problems , however , arose at eight special Tijuana polling_places designated for &quot; voters in transit , &quot; a category encompassing Mexicans residing in the United States but eligible to vote_in Mexico . The sheer number of voters overwhelmed the system in Tijuana , as it did throughout the nation ; at the airport , the bus_station and the main post_office in the downtown tourist district , lines stretched for blocks , causing five-hour waits and angry grumbling . &quot; The problems at the special polling_places are very serious , &quot; said Javier Gonzalez Monroy , a city_council member and state president of the PRD . &quot; There is a general lack of organization. &quot; Gonzalez pointed_out that support for Cardenas is particularly strong among Mexicans in the United States and that the PRD could suffer . Emilio and Adriana Santos , a factory_worker and nurse from South Gate , accompanied a cousin from Jalisco to Tijuana hoping to vote , then realized they did not possess current voting credentials . Despite his 15 years living north of the border , Emilio Santos said he remains engrossed in Mexican politics and hopeful for a clean and fair election . &quot; We want a change , &quot; he said . &quot; The people will not accept more lies and stealing . We want the truth. &quot;</TEXT>
