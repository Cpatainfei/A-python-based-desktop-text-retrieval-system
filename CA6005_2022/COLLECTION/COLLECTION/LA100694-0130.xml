   <TEXT> The ticket_agent at Los Angeles International Airport looked skeptically at Erin Margaret Schuman . Schuman ' s tickets had her title as Dr. and standing before the agent was a woman much younger than the average college professor . The 31-year-old assistant_professor at Caltech is used to that look , used to people thinking that someone so young , especially if that someone is a woman , couldn ' t possibly hold a doctorate . &quot; No one ever believes I ' m a professor , &quot; said Schuman , who teaches biology and was_on her way to a neurobiology conference in Israel . &quot; They ' ll see the word doctor , look_at me and think it ' s a mistake. &quot; But all Schuman has to do is turn_to her microscope and describe how the transference of nitric_oxide between neurons in a rat ' s brain affects memory to persuade nonbelievers that she is , indeed , Dr. Schuman . Schuman received her Ph.D in neuroscience from Princeton_University in 1990 and joined Caltech last year as the biology_department ' s youngest faculty_member . Along with teaching introductory neurobiology this fall , Schuman is researching a number of ways in which information is processed and stored in the brain . With the help of eight assistants and five grants , ranging from $ 30 # 000 to $ 350 # 000 , Schuman will continue to explore the human_body ' s most mysterious organ . By studying live tissue from the hippocampus region of the brain , where memory activity takes_place , Schuman is trying to learn more about illnesses such_as Alzheimer ' s disease and Attention_Deficit_Disorder , which hinder a person ' s memory . Specifically , Schuman is tracking how far nitric_oxide can travel between neurons before it is metabolized by other chemicals and what effect that relationship -- between the gas and surrounding neurons -- has_on long-term_memory . A self-proclaimed perfectionist , Schuman is intent_on understanding the elusive nature of memory . &quot; It ' s like being an artist ; I ' m consumed by my work . I think and dream about my experiments all_the time , &quot; she said . &quot; My mood is completely determined by what happened in the lab that day. &quot; Schuman did not explore her interest in biology until graduate_school but was always an intense student . She used to get migraine headaches from the self-imposed pressure to achieve perfect grades . Schuman ' s mother , Susan , who lives_in Fullerton , called her daughter &quot; a compulsive learner . I was concerned about her , because anything less than an A devastated her . I just wanted her to relax , &quot; she said . Schuman ' s office windowsill is lined with papers about such topics as farnesyltransferase inhibitors , while a pink and black Mickey_Mouse hat sits conspicuously on the shelves behind her desk . Being a young , successful scientist has had its disadvantages , Schuman says . &quot; I didn ' t get_to do the Europe thing , &quot; she said about the common post-college adventure . At this point , she said , she often feels lucky just to get a weekend away from the lab . &quot; But someday , when people ask me why they always lose their car keys , I ' ll have an answer_for them , &quot; she said . &quot; That will feel good. &quot;</TEXT>
