   <HEADLINE> THE LAST DAYS OF RANCHO DE LOS DIABLOS ; THE LARGEST MIGRANT CAMP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS BULLDOZED THIS MONTH -- ONE MORE TWIST IN A HISTORY AND FABLE IN PROGRESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No morning at Rancho de los Diablos really begins until Don Trino descends into the canyon at a_few minutes past 4 in his red-and-silver lunch truck . Before any light , before the roosters crow on the eastern side of the camp , don Trino parks near two eucalyptus_trees and waits silently in the cab . Until it was razed this fall , Rancho de los Diablos , which stretched for seven-tenths of a mile along the bottom of Mc Gonigle Canyon in the northwest corner of the city of San Diego , was the largest-and perhaps oldest migrant camp in Southern California . At its height , in the late ' 70s , the camp had as_many as 2 # 000 residents . By this summer , the population stood at 600 . As a 20 year-old squatters camp located on private_property , it was always a center of controversy . City officials called it a health hazard . Nearby homeowners targeted it as a drag_on property values and a magnet for crime . Advocacy groups rallied around it as a glaring example of San Diego ' s failure to provide adequate housing for immigrant laborers-the backbone of the area ' s $ 800-million agricultural industry . This spring , after years of task_forces and resolution , the city finally decided to relocate 39 families and level the camp . Unlike the 200 or so other encampments that account_for 15 # 000 migrants throughout San Diego county , Rancho de los Diablos evolved from a bachelors society to an organized community that included not just field hands , gardeners and day_laborers but also women and children . Several years ago , as advocacy groups improved living conditions and promised the construction of better housing , the men , most of whom are legal residents , brought their families up from Mexico . By the end , services included weekly check cashing , a credit_system , trash_pickup , toilets , colar- and generator-powered electricity , Avon delivery , a water_system , student carpools , and elected town council , a brothel under the stars , a local marijuana patch , fake green_cards , a vibrant trade_in crystal methaphetamine and daily patrols by the San Diego Police_Department . &quot; There ' s bit of everything here , &quot; one resident told me with a smile , betraying amusement and amazement bordering_on outrage . she wasn ' t just rendering to her fellow residents , but to the baptisms and quincianeras , first Communions wand weddings , deaths and fires that have marked the camp ' s history . By the time the last bulldozers came_in late October and cleared_away 401 cardboard , plywood , plastic and metal-sided shacks , a medical clinic , six restaurants , two soccer fields , four basketball_courts and a volleyball_court , the communal bathhouse and general_store , the men had already erected a new camp less than a mile away . It ' s happened this way for 20 years . The city or the growers tear_down a camp and another sprouts up . So , the destruction of Rancho de los Diablos this fall was really only a twist in the plot of a story that spans three decades . It is a verdadera historia , truly a story , because it is history and fable in_progress that begins with a low point for Cesar Chavez and turns_on the feudal living conditions of most farm_workers in San diego County . * Just Down The Road From Don Trino ' s lunch truck , Dona Adelina rises from the wooden pallet that she shares with her husband , Don Cidronio , slides her feet into worn black flats and turns_on a flashlight . Quietly , so as not to wake her 16-year-old son , who sleeps on the other side of a partition , she removes the chain from the door of her family ' s three-room canton , shack . Once outside , she dips water from a metal_drum to wash her hands and face , slicks the excess water into her medium-length black hair and brushes her teeth . Forty-six years old , Dona Adelina has a wide , stern face and a down-turned mouth . Shen she meets you for the first time , she looks_at you from the corner of her eyes , like a farmer sizing_up a stranger . She arrived_at Rancho de los Diablos in 1992 from Zacatetan , in the state of Guerrero , to join her husband , who had become a legal resident under amnesty . With her eldest daughters married , there was no reason to remain separated from Don Cidronio nine months of the year . &quot; After so many years of hearing about America , &quot; She says , &quot; I wanted to see what people were talking about. &quot; Inside the low-slung canton , she lights a white candle and clicks on the pocket transistor radio to a local banda station . Wrappping a towel around her head to keep_from catching_cold , she returns outside to kindle a fire in the horno , the squat clay oven she made when she first arrived_at the camp . She feeds more wood into the mouth of the oven , which is covered with a round metal griddle cut from the top of the nearby drum , and the smell of burning wood mingles with the crip morning air . when the first man stumbles form his canton don Trino walks to the back of the truck . &quot; How ' s it going ? &quot; he asks absently as he lifts the back section . &quot; Well , I ' m here , &quot; replies a slightly built man who stands above the ashes of a long dead bonfire and hugs himself from the morning cold . Trino opens the long side of the ruck and , without a word , throws_out empty cartons into the pile of ashes . The haggard man tears the boxes , pulls a lighter from his shirt pocket and starts a fire . to keep it going , don Trino piles on grocery_bags and plastic foam cups as the man stoops at the edge of the flames , his shining face partially obscured by the stings of black smoke rising from the burning plastic . At 5 , Son Cidronio emerges from the doorway and mumbles &quot; Buenos dias &quot; to Dona Adelina . A short , wide man , with a stomach that juts_out just below his chest and hangs over his belt , he sits_down to eat the oatmeal his wife has spooned into a Campbell ' s soup mug . The men of the camp often confuse Don Cidronios generosity and good_nature for comical stupidity . but those have been precisely the qualities that have sustained him during his 20 years at the camp-he is one of its two earliest residents . Up and down the road , men who cannot endure the face-twisting stench of the portable toilet follow footpaths into high weeds to relieve themselves . They carry handfuls of toilet_paper , old newspaper and crumpled brown paper_bags to use when the squat , their hats dipping below the top of the weeds . When Don Cidronio finishes his breakfast , Dona Adelina hands him a jar of pink Jergens There Way All Purpose Face and Beauty Cream that he rubs on his face , neck and arms for protection from the sun . she then pours a stew of eggs , chile and tomatoes into his thermos and packs it into a nylon backpack . Don Cidronio pulls a flannel shirt over a blue T-shirt . &quot; Do you have everything father ? &quot; she asks . &quot; he answers , walking toward the road . Dona Adelina , with arms folded , watches the procession of men converge on Don Trino ' s fiyuqua , lunch truck . Around the truck , men make instant Necafe and dip maria cookies into their cups . They greet each other with nicknames and nods . Some fill plastic bags with sweet bread , soda and burritos . Few pay . son Trino stands nearby with a notebook in_hand and enters the merchandise brought . When a man his just cruzado la Linea , crossed the border , he can open a line_of_credit with Don Trino if he has work with los diablos , the_devils , the Ukegawa family , who run tomato strawberry , cucumber and bean fields from Del Mar to San Luis Rey . Clumps of men start to walk toward the Carmel Valley cucumber fields . Others ride bikes up Black Mountain Road , Climb onto the backs of pickups and cram themselves into aging cars . And so they spread_out to the east and west and north . Don Trino calculates the morning sales in his spiral notebook . Dona ' Adelina returns to sleep until 8 and Don Cidronio looks_out the back of a brown Chevy pickup on his way to the fields . Only later will his wife remind him that it is his 60th birthday . * In Carmel Valley , a mile and a half west of the camp , the workday begins at about 6:40 . Under straw_hats and baseball_caps , the men pick cucumbers strung_along three-foot vines . The small spines , removed before the cucumbers reach the stores , can cut_through cotton gloves and pierce a man ' s fingers , numbing his hands by day ' s end . They load the cucumbers into square wooden boxes and the boxes onto metal-framed wheel barrows . The loaded carts are then taken_to a woman in a straw_hat , who counts the boxes and inspects the Vegetables . If she is satisfied with the produce , she punches a paper card that the men keep_in their front pockets . But if a box contains too many yellow cucumbers , it will be discarded and noted as shoddy work . The men then unload their small crates into larger boxes . A forlift carries the larger boxes to a nearby flatbed truck , and the men return with the empty carts to refill the boxes . they bend below the top of the rows and do not rise again until they ' ve filled a crate . In other fields , men weed , moving_up and down until sweat falls from their noses and chins , until their backs tingle , until the pain has rhythm . Other men ride into newly powered fields on flatbeds loaded with stakes . One crew plants the stakes in shallow holes . Another crew follows with a device called el_nino , the baby . A man lifts the 10-pound hollow-metal nino over his head , holding two curved handles that look_like the bent arms of an infant , and brings it down over the top of the stake , driving it into the ground . Relatively easy , this chore can also be tricky and dangerous . If a man tires and loses his concentration , he can hit the edge of a stake and send splinters flying into his face . Except for the short of &quot; Apurate ! &quot; - Hurry up ! -from the crew chiefs who march up and down the rows , the men work un silence . The only other sounds are the hum of the forklift and the thud of the cucumbers tumbling from box to box . Drinking water comes form the irrigation pipes . Many fields have no bathrooms , and the men are expected to relieve themselves , quickly , in the dirt . There are no breaks . Lunch is for 30 minutes , starting at 11 , when Don Trino or another man from El Burrito Catering arrives . Sitting on the ground , the men tear_into stiff burritos and tortas . With a watchful efficiency . Don Trino calculates the lunch sales into neat columns under each man ' s name . When the foremen call_out , the day continues until 4 . By then , it will take some of the older_men almost the entire walk back ot the rancho to stand_up straight . Every man and adolescent sleeps_with rubbing alcohol by his bed . * Back At The Camp , with two speakers , a 300-watt amplifier and a CD_player powered by a buzzing generator , Ramiro straddles a microphone stand and croons a string of rancheras , nortenas and American standards . He practices from 9 until noon under the blue tarp next to El Restaurante del Chivo . With a round face , curly brown hair , a small scar on the right side of his chin and a plump little nose , Ramiro had been at the camp off and on for 19 years . He is now 34 years old and goes_by the nickname la gringa and , in the cosmos of Rancho de los Diablos , he is the mobile entrepreneur . Because Rancho Penasquitos , the nearest school district , won ' t send buses up dirt roads , Ramiro shuttles about 30 of the camp ' s school-aged children in his 1966 Dodges Monaco every morning . He charges $ 2 a day for each child ; he also drives men to the fields , charging them $ 4 round-trip . His most clever venture , though , is the afternoon football game that he runs at the dusty field on the western side of the camp . He is the game ' s concessionaire as well as its announcer . To play , each man must hand Ramiro $ 2 . In exchange , the winning players get two free beers . &quot; Here we are at the_Devil ' s Cup , &quot; he intones at the start of every game , &quot; brought_to you by Budweiser , the King of Beers... &quot; The game consists_of only one period ; the first_team to score two goals wins , and there are no boundaries except when the ball is totally unplayable . The game usually attracts about 40 onlookers-a tough , rowdy crowd that rarely has a good_word for the players . When a goal is scored , Ramiro booms , &quot; Gooaaallll ! ! ! ! ! mimicking well-known TV_announcer Andres Cantor . But this morning , Ramiro isn ' t concerned with commerce . He bends his knees and closes his eyes , and his baritone sails across the camp . Leaning_against a nearby trailer , sitting on dusty plastic chairs , onlookers come and go . Ruben , a crackly-voiced 13-year-old , stays to taunt Ramiro . Their exchangers begin when Ramiro calls him a little female quail , a reference_to Ruben ' s wet , slicked hair . When Ramiro sings , &quot; Lo hice hado a mimanera , &quot; the Spanish-language version of &quot; My Way , &quot; Ruben shouts , &quot; Come on , maricon . Let ' s go , you faggot . Come_on , Gloria Trevi , throw_out your calzones . Throw_out your panties. &quot; Just across the creed from Don Trino ; s truck , Ruben ' s 7-year-old sister , Angelica , wearing a red dress and high black boots , twirls from a yellow rope that hangs from a tree_branch . Her older sister , Rubicelia , sits on a shaky wooden chair and reads mail from her grandparents in Arcelia , Guerrero . &quot; I miss hem , &quot; she says . &quot; I want to go back. &quot; Rubicelia and her mother , Angelita , have pored over the letter a dozen times . A quiet , watchful woman with a broad red face and and even line of white teeth , Angelita came north with her children two years ago . Her husband had been living_in the camp since 1977 , and she only saw him during the winter . he was sleeping_with other women , Angelita says , leaning her face onto the side of her hands . He was drinking , she says , gesturing with her hands a if lifting a bottle to her lips . &quot; There were months and months when we didn ' t get any money , when there was no food in the house . As an adult I could bear it , but the children suffered . There was_on day , i remember , when we didn ' t even have salt . it was then i decided to come_with the children . i figured at least they would eat. &quot; Ramiro , who has been overhearing the conversation , shakes his head and arches his eyes . &quot; Ves . Estas mujeres son muy sufridas , &quot; he says . &quot; You see . These women are sufferers. &quot; * With His Permed black hair , red Wet ' n Wild lipstick , Stetson cologne , gold chains and bracelets and zirconia earring studs , Felipe is the reigning queen of Rancho de los Diablos . At 24 , he looks middle-aged , with slight bags under his eyes . Everyone calls him La Morena , the Black_Woman . Midmorning , he walks through the camp in tight ash-blue Guess ? shorts and a T-shirt reading Surf Fruit . The men whistle and jeer , saying &quot; Hola bonita , ven aqui. &quot; Not answering , he sashays into the largest restaurant in the camp . The eldest of seven children , Felipe came_to the ranch in 1989 from a pueblo outside Veracruz . He used to work as an Ukegawa field hand but now cleans_houses on Poway and Mira Mesa , towns east of the camp . His rambling canton , which sits on an embankment behind the soccer field , is the nearest thing to luxurious living at Rancho de los Diablos . Christmas streamers hang from the plywood ceiling . A black scalop-shaped couch dominates the living area ; in one corner , a plywood table , covered with a tartan blanket , hold a black-and-white stuffed dog , a brown teddy_bear , a brown stuffed pup and a ceramic blue-and white praying Virgin . Like a Hobbit hole , Felipe ' s canton extends into the side of the canyon . One of the back_rooms is a sleeping porch for the five other gay_men who live there . His tiny bedroom is burrowed farthest into the hillside . he has carefully painted the walls canary_yellow and the ceiling white ; a bamboo parasol hangs over the bed . The effect is one of stately colonial decay . four shelves to the left of the bedroom door hold a makeup sponge , One-A Day Vitamins for Women , foaming Face Wash , a white candle , assorted hose ( knee-high length ) , rosary beads , tasseled loafers and two pairs of black patent-leather pumps . The small plastic window over the bed does not open , so by midday the rooms is like a sauna . At Dona Rosa ' s restaurant , Felipe sits on a long wooden bench with his lover , Salvador . Waiting for their lunch , they are joined by Armando , a tall , gaunt , bearded man who wears a dusty black cap that read &quot; Chihuahua , &quot; his home state . &quot; Oh , God , &quot; Felipe says in a high-pitched voice when Armando sits next to him . &quot; Ahi ! Here ' s my pretty morena , &quot; Armando says leaning_against Felipe ' s shoulder . &quot; She ' s my girlfriend. &quot; &quot; No , I ' m not , &quot; Felipe says . &quot; How are you going_to maintain me ? &quot; There are 10 openly gay_men at the rancho . One is HIV positive . Their partners come from the gray area of Mexican machismo-that is , from the large_number of men who are straight by day and gay by night . It takes a conversation with Cristobal to understand the unspoken rules of a camp that prides itself on sheltering the identity of its &quot; heterosexual brothers. &quot; A short , frail , mocha-skinned man with Indian features and a head of thick black hair , Cristobal is slightly pigeon-toed and speaks with a lisp . He came_to America in 1989 and lost half of his right ring_finger in a lawn-mower accident . Cristobal now picks beefsteak tomatoes in the fields . in the evenings , he cooks on a propane stove for a group of six men . he is 27 and , like all_the men , looks 19 years older . Cristobal points_out the bruises on his chest and ribs where he was beaten by an angry lover the week before . &quot; He was drunk , and he hit me and kicked me on the ground . i ran_through the camp and hid . he did_it because I got tired . he ' s not gay . El is hombre . he was doing_it to me . i ' m gay , and he ' s the man . he has a wife and kids . he ' s not a homosexual. &quot; Until 1990 , the rancho , then located half a mile northeast of its current location , was exclusively a male domain , where boys became prison girlfriends . A lawless place where $ 5 prostitutes swarmed the_hills on payday , where bandits roamed the fields in ski_masks , robbing their victims at gunpoint and leaving them in fields miles away . As_many as seven residents were killed in the course of a year . Back then , as now , a drunken argument could erupt into a gun or knife_fight , and the next day the body would be found in the dust . Makeshift shrines with Guadalupe candles still mark the spot where many of the men fell . Collections were taken and the bodies sent to their pueblos for their viudas , hijos , padres y parientes-widows , children , parents and relatives to give them a proper Catholic burial . * Don Cidronio came During those years . he left Zacatetan in March , 1974 , crossed the border in May and was working in the Ukegawa strawberry fields by June . he was 40 years old and a mason by trade . That year , Rancho de los Diablos was a nameless encampment scattered throughout a section of McGonigle Canyon known locally as Devil ' s Canyon . Don Cidronio lived_in a hole covered by sticks and brush to avoid detection by the Border_Patrol . Other men simply pulled plastic or tarps over sticks , hung their food in bags from trees and slept on the open under flea-and tick-infested blankets . Every Friday , they bathed in the stream where the chapel to the Virgen de Guadalupe now stands or washed themselves from the irrigation pip ( es . they stripped_down only to their underwear , not out of modesty but from fear of snakes . They coded crude meals on open_fires or bought moldy burritos from Don Trino and other fiyuqueros who catered to the thousands of men living_in the_hill tips and valleys . After a week of training without pay , Don Cidronio worked a horse and plow , earning 70 cents an hour . The horses were given an hour ' s rest , the men 30 minutes for lunch . When work ran behind schedule , men were harnessed and made to pull the plows . The following year , 1975 , Gov . Jerry Brown signed into law the Agricultural labor Relations Act , giving farm_workers , for the first time in American history , the right to bargain collectively . On paper , the act gave undocumented workers who were too fearful of deportation the right to report abuses , to vote on union representation , file complaints and testify at Agricultural labor Relations Board hearings . &quot; The law is a godsend , &quot; Cesar Chavez said . &quot; Without question the best law for workers-any workers in the entire country. &quot; The same year . United Farm_Workers organizers came_to Mc Gonigle Canyon . Chavez himself toured the canyon to organize against the Ukegawas . &quot; I ' ve seen a lot &quot; he said . &quot; But these conditions were among the worst . Disgusting . Inhumane. &quot; On their first visit , organizers brought food , potable water ( an unheard of luxury ) and clothes . On their second visit , they brought a large color_television and a generator for the men to watch soccer games . Slowly , the men began to sign union_cards . But not all_of them were moved by the promises of a better life. &quot; &quot; I remember when the great Chavez came , &quot; says Don Costodio , a tractor operator who has been with the Ukegawas for 22 years and loves in a canton at the edge of the creek . With gray hair , gold-capped teeth and eyes always red from the dust the tractor kicks_up , don Custodio has seen &quot; do gooders &quot; came and go . He is Don Cidronio ' s friend and often visits in the evening . By the time Adelina is absorbed in the radio , Don Custodio his teeth glinting in the candlelight-launches into his deatribe . His father fought for one of Zapata ' s generals . the revolution promised to bring land_reform . Instead , his father ended_up with eight hectares of hilly , rocky soil that was nearly impossible to farm . The Catholic_church is no good . They ' re just interested in your money . You ' ve got_to pay_for everything . To get_married . to get buried . The priests cant be trusted . The priests can ' t be trusted . They spy on peasants around the world . They say they ' re helping you , but they bring us green bread on Saturdays . The monologue goes_into the night . don Cidronio snores . Dona Adelina , a devout Catholic , nods absently , not wanting to argue . don Costodio strikes the final chords on the moral . &quot; the poor people who do the fighting , who suffer , end_up fighting , who suffer end_up with nothing in the end . that ' s the way it is. &quot; For Don Costodio , it all leads back to the UFW ' s 1975 organizing campaign . ' they passed papers out . told us they ; were going_to help us . but I didn ' t have time . i had to work to feed my wife and children in Guerrero. &quot; By August , 1975 , Joe and Hiroshi Ukegawa had fired 57 UFW supporters , many of whom were &quot; green-carders , &quot; legal workers and U.S. residents . In November , a union organizer woke_up with a gun to his face . in 1975 , two union supporters , Arnaldo Zavala and Jose Sandoval , tried to speak_to workers . Jose Morrotte , a Ukegawa foreman told them to leave . As Azvala and Sandoval walked away , Morrotte fired a file_in their direction . Morrotte later testified he was &quot; target practicing. &quot; Fearing serious injury to his organizers , Chavez curtailed the organizing drive and decided to fight his case before the newly formed Agriculture Labor Relations Board . The UFW charged that Ukegawa illegally fired and intimidated workers to hamper unionizing efforts . it took two years for the case to reach a hearing . in December , 1977 , Joe and Hisroshi Ukegawa and their foremen took_the_stand and denied all charges . After almost a year of testimony and six months of deliberation , the ALRB found that &quot; the company had engaged in such egregious and widespread conduct as_to demonstrate a general disregard for its employees fundamental statutory rights. &quot; The board ordered that the Ukegawa Brothers Inc. reinstate 62 workers with back pay and interest . But what appeared to be UFW triumph turned_out to be a hollow victory . The Ukegawas appealed the decision and quickly won a stay . Waiting for the court ruling , UFW organizers returned to the fields in 1980 . By then , many workers from the initial drive had moved_on . Like Don Costodio , the now wary men only remembered that the UFW hadn ' t delivered . And this time , the Ukegawas were_better prepared . they bulldozed roads to keep organizers out ; they threatened field hands who picked_up their lunch from the UFW co-op . By the end of the summer , Chavez pulled_out . &quot; I didn ' t want our guys in there , &quot; Chavez said . &quot; We should not risk our organizers lives . it ' s too isolated in there , and anything can happen , &quot; Today , 19 years later , the Ukegawa family-which , the ALRB suspects , has operated under the names golden Bear and Del Mar Produce and now operates Leslie farms Inc. is still tied_up in court with the ALRB , and the Ukegawas owe the state at least $ 2 # 532 , 241 in back wages and interest from the original case . &quot; It is not uncommon to see a case last this long when you see the number of appeals available , &quot; says kerry Donnell , regional director of the ALRB El centro office . &quot; We have a big judgement....but we don ' t have priority . we ' re not a secured creditor like a bank. &quot; In 193 , San diego tomato growers , which includes the Ukegwas , reported $ 37 million in sales . That same year , son cidronio earned $ 8 # 825 . Brothers Hiroshi and Joe Ukegawa were born in 1921 and 1926 , respectively , in Santo Ana . When they were 21 and 16 , they were interned at the Colorado_River Relocation Center in Poston , Ariz . Hiroshi was released in 1944 , Joe in 1945 . Shortly after World_War_II , they began planting strawberries and tomatoes in northern San Diego County . their experience as internees invariably surfaces when they are accused of labor abuses . &quot; I have known them since 1969 , &quot; said William N . Sauer Jr. , a Carlsbad attorney who has represented the family on several occasions . &quot; These individuals suffered so_much abuse . &quot; that ' s why I ' m so shocked by the allegations , &quot; he told reporters a_few years ago . &quot; I find them incredible. &quot; Cousins Jon , James and Joe Ukegawa , sons of the founders now oversee the business . ( The family and its attorneys did not respond to any phone calls. ) Fourteen years after the decision , Ukegawa workers earn the minimum_wage cuatro veinticinco , $ 4.25 an hour . that ' s for a field hand , a crew chief , a tractor operator , a new arrival or a 20 year veteran . Before taxes , that adds_up to $ 170 , with take-home about $ 144 . This salary does not cover strawberry picking in the Carlsbad fields . there , the men earn $ 1.15 a flat . It is rare for a man to pick more_than 11 flats a day without marring the strawberries . that means , on average , the men earn $ 75.90 a week before taxes . The exceptional and they young can bring_in as much as $ 90 a week . &quot; now that we ' re picking strawberries , i can ' t save anything , &quot; says Alejandro flores , a four-year resident at the camp , holding a $ 75 check_in his hands . &quot; Sometimes I don ' t even have money to call , only to eat . It cost $ 55 to $ 60 to eat a week . Breakfast is $ 2 a burrito , a drink . Then the fiyuqua arrives , and you eat_away $ 4 at midday . And dinner cost about $ 15 , $ 18 , $ 21 a week . the fiyuqua people are great . They give us credit . they change our checks for a dollar , $ 1.25. that ' s not_bad . If you don ' t have a car , you have to pay $ 24 a week for a ride . We ' re left with simply nothing . Only for eating . Cuatro Veinticinco also sheds_light_on the financial intricacies of the camp , where credit is an elegant system of kindness that begins with Don Trino and his fiyuqua and can affect any transaction in which money trades hands . Son Trino had been a lettuce picker outside of Phoenix when he came_to San Diego around 1974 to help his friend with the fledgling El Burrito lunch-truck business . he is a large , taciturn man with curly , graying black hair , ham hands , a bushy mustache and a face that is frozen into a squint even on a cloudy day . his favorite expression is cabron , son_of_a_bitch , which either can be an insult or a compliment , but punctuates almost every sentence . On the hottest day of summer , he wears a blue flannel shirt over a white V-neck undershirt . known as el bigote , the mustache , or simply ElTrino , he is a looming , silent presence at any impromptu gathering in the camp . Hunched_over a picnic table , barely acknowledging the conversation around him , he eats sunflower sees , loudly spits the shells_out , and swigs down the vinegar from a small jar of jalapenos . One afternoon , Jimmy Ukegawa , in frameless glasses , khaki shirt and pants , descended into the camp in a white pickup_truck . Every man , woman and child froze momentarily and fell silent . Ukegawa stopped near the picnic table , walked over to Don Trino and handed his a sheet from a yellow notepad . After he left and people began to breathe normally again , Trino explained that the note only contained the name of a man who had been overpaid . The Ukegawa and El Burrito catering interests are in tertwined . Only men who work for the Ukegawas get credit . If a man does not square his account on Friday , his credit_line is cut and the balance taken_out of his check . if a man is going_to be fired by the Ukegawas , the balance he owes Don Trino is subtracted from his check . &quot; When I die , &quot; Don Trino likes to say , tapping his head , &quot; everything is going_with me. &quot; * Don Arnulfo Duarte is a Tractor operator who came_to el rancho in 1977 . A native of Arcelia , in the state of Guerrero , he is a slow-moving man with an ample belly whose love for watermelons has earned him the nickname la sandia , the watemelon . Son Arnulfo ' s sleepy brown eyes and deadpan delivery undercut the most startling utterances that fly from his mouth . His wife , Dona Asuncion , came_with their children , Perla and Osvaldo , in 1992 . Ruddy-faced with graying curly hair and a considerable paunch , Mrs . Watermelon , as she is sometimes called , runs the family restaurant , a rambling wooden structure of makeshift additions that can seat 15 people . On a Friday night , though , El Restaurante del Chivo , the goat restaurant , serves as_many as 50 customers who have come for the house specialty , the 45 roasted goat dinner . Don Arnulfo ' s family occupies the camp ' s thin bourgeois strata-longtime residents with regular incomes and small businesses . Like the other natives of Guerrero , they live close to the camp ' s center and look down upon the Mixtec Indians from Oaxaca and the handful of recently arrive Guatemalans . operating without health permits , restaurant owners like Don Arnulfo generally clear at least $ 300 a week . In addition to selling goat meat to the other restaurants , he also charges 50 cents for the use of his blender . With the camp closing , Don Arnulfo sees the end of a captive market . &quot; You can ' t just open a restaurant in the city . you need permission . You have to pay rent . It ' s expensive. &quot; Thursday is goat-killing day , and a preoccupied Don Arnulfo sits on a faded green and gold couch on the restaurant ' s cooking porch . A chicken pace the dirt floor , and a transistor radio plays rancheras and corridas . Dona Asuncion pushes wood into the side of the drum to start fire . The goat bucks against the wall of an adjacent shack . The butcher hasn ' t arrived yet and Don Arnulfo , with an agitated expression on his large round face , needs to talk . &quot; People say the world is going_to end this Saturday , &quot; he announces . Dona Asuncion , dressed in a white knee-length skirt and a yellow T-shirt that reads &quot; Released . but not Free &quot; around the likeness of Nelson Mandela , keeps a worried eye on the conversation as she throws the gutted and cleaned carcass of a quail on the drum stove . &quot; Something is going_to crash into the earth , and there will be floods and earthquakes. &quot; Arnuflfo continues . Dona Asuncion nods her head almost imperceptibly to support her husband ' s statement . &quot; No. &quot; I explain . &quot; that ' s another planet . A comet is going_to collide_with Jupiter. &quot; Don Arnulfo remains perplexed . Dona Asuncion flips the quail with her bare hand . &quot; Jupiter , &quot; he asks , &quot; is that far ? &quot; &quot; Yes , it ' s hundreds of millions of miles away. &quot; &quot; That far . So , there won ' t be any earthquakes or floods here ? &quot; &quot; No. &quot; &quot; Jupiter . Do people live there ? &quot; &quot; No &quot; &quot; Gracias a Dios. &quot; Thank God . Dona Ascuncion removes the quail , places it on a plastic plate and begins heating tortillas . As she flips them with her hands , Christauria Welland Akon enters , wearing jeans , sandals and a pink T-shirt . &quot; Come in , come_in , &quot; Arnulfo says , rising from the couch . &quot; It ' s hot in here , &quot; says Christauria , her round beatific face red from the heat and the sun . As the liaison for Our Lady of Mt . Carmel parish in Rancho Penasquitos , Christauria , a cheerful , energetic woman , has the daunting task of serving as friend , religious counselor and social_worker to the camp . Each summer she and her husband take children to the beach and the zoo . &quot; Some of them have never seen the ocean. &quot; she says , her blue eyes widening . Christauria coordinates the weekly chapel_services every Saturday morning , organizes the church volunteers who serve donated food after mass , schedules baptisms and leads preparation classes for First Communions . Christauria has come_to the goat restaurant to help Dona Asuncion and Don Arnulfo plan for the First Communion of their godchild . As padrinos , godparents , it is their responsibility to buy the girl ' s white First Communion dress and to make arrangements for the Mass . To consider cost for any of these events is bad taste , a cultural sin . A family , compadres and comadres must spend lavishly on the celebration so everyone will talk_about it for years . &quot; We don ' t know where to get a dress for her. &quot; Dona Asuncion says . &quot; It costs more here , &quot; Christauria replies . &quot; It would be better for you to go_to Tijuana , where you can find something inexpensive . But if you don ' t want to go all_the way to Tijuana , you can go_to Escondido . i don ' t know where they go , but I know they go and buy and spend thousands of dollars. &quot; &quot; We want the best , &quot; Dona Asuncion insists . &quot; We want the prettiest dress , not just any dress. &quot; &quot; Ah , so you want something that ' s worth a lot , right ? Christauria shakes her head . &quot; But why do you spend your money on these things ? I just don ' t understand it. &quot; ' Well , it ' s because we ' re used to it , it ' s our custom , &quot; Dona Asuncion says . &quot; You barely have food and almost no place to live and you all spend hundreds of dollars on the dresses for these girls . Explain it to me Perla , &quot; Christauria says to Dona Asuncion ' s shy , chubby 16-year-old daughter , who responds with a giggle . &quot; Can you explain that to me ? For me its a mystery to this very day . I don ' t under stand why a man here hits his wife , and I don ' t understand why you spend so_much money for a dress the you ' ll use for just a little while. &quot; &quot; Well , it ' s for people not to say.. &quot; Dona Asuncion hesitates . &quot; Well , you see , we Mexicans are very nosy , and we gossip a ot . We do_it because we do not want anyone to say que somos bien codos , that we ' re stingy. &quot; &quot; Andale , that ' s it , &quot; Christauria says triumphantly , as if she ' d finally cornered Dona Asuncion into making the point for her . &quot; Well , these things I really don ' t know about because , although I have more money than you all have , I don ' t spend hundreds of dollars on such things . I don ' t spend my money that way . that ' s why I have money. &quot; &quot; Well , that means you ' re very stingy then , &quot; don Arnulfo says , and the family laughs . On Friday Afternoons , the patch of dirt east of Don Arnulfo restaurant turns_into a town plaza and business_district . Don Jose arrives first , around 3 , his Chevy Custom pickup weighted down with swap meet goods . He sets_up three tables and displays ratchet handles , ashtrays from the Ritz-Carlton , garden Gloves , bags of marbles , back-support work belts , sued boots , back issue of TV y Novela magazines , Spanish-English dictionaries , synthetic silk Partee shirts , bicycle patch kits , Palmolive de Lujo , patches , thread , eight-track tapes , aspirin , Virgen de Guadalupe T-shirts , porn magazines and key_rings that read &quot; I ' m in no hurry . I ' m on my way to work. &quot; Men trickle in from the fields , their hands red or green from strawberries and tomatoes . They line_up at Don Trino ' s truck to cash their checks , which costs a dollar on every $ 100 ( the change remains with the cashier ) . It was not until around 1989 that any of them received check_stubs , and it was not until then that men who were &quot; legal , &quot; like Don Cidronio , began to file tax_returns . Most of the men are illiterate , and they nut around for a stranger to help them sign their names on the backs of their names on the backs of their checks . At Rancho de los Diablos , when you ask a man his age , he often tells you his age , he often tells you his birth year and asks you to figure the rest . At the footbridge , Ramiro sells beer from the trunk of car . &quot; Come on , come and get them . They ' re cold . Freshly killed . The beer is dead cold . All you have to do is ask_for them . i know you ' re thirsty . come and get em. &quot; Across the way , men who don ' t have socks put plastic shopping_bags over their feet to try_on boots . A baby-faced teen buys a green cap that reads &quot; My summer began at Sarah ' s Bat Mitzvah. &quot; Young_men cruise the main strip of the camp in bicycles , pickups and motorcycles . An 8-year-old boy sits at the edge of the crowds of drinking men and collects their empty cans . When a bag is_full , he runs home across the creek and returns with an empty bag . A white van that ' s been converted to an ice_cream truck chimes &quot; The Entertainer. &quot; Half a mile from the camp , las viejas , prostitutes from Tijuana , escondido and San Diego , descend in skin-tight miniskirts and high hells that puncture the dust . Wobbling down an embankment to a stand of eucalyptus tress , they carry their tools in white plastic grocery_bags : cloth towels and rolls of toile paper . * With The White Homes of Rancho Penasquitos in the distance , Tlva Medina looks_like a misplaced angel riding_on a clud of dust on her way to her quincianera . No one would call her beautiful , and no one would say she was ugly , but in this void_of plainness , she captures you attention : She is pretty because she has grace . Today , the 10th grades at Mount Carmel High_School and reads Bambi books to practice her English will be the center of the world . she wears a $ 300 three tiered white satin dress with puffed-out sleeves , pink earrings and long satin gloves . She lifts her dress so it won ' t drag through the dust . There , in the shade of eucalyptus_trees , surrounded by her four escorts , she sits on a carpet-covered bench facing a small chapel . built two years ago by Don Cidronio , the cement-block sanctuary frames the blue-and white figure of the Virgen de Guadalupe . A balding priest in a green robe with a round face named Father Fawcett celebrates mass . his altar , holding the cruet and hosts , is an overturned washing_machine covered by a rainbow-colored blanket . Nearby , the stream rushes from a small waterfall . As the service continues , little boys throw rocks in the water ; others run_into the woods to pee . Elva ' s father leans_on a tree and beams . near the end of the service , her mother , a short woman in a blue and with dress , rises from her bench and asks God to protect her daughter as the family prepares to leave the camp for the city . Dona Asuncion and Cristobal , among the 50 parishioners present , solemly nod their heads . After the aleluya and Communion and the presentation of the gold signet_ring with ? ? number 15 on top , a ? ? ? ? a volunteer invites everyone to stay : &quot; Today we have spaghetti. &quot; As Elva ' s father takes pictures of his daughter and friends and people line_up for food , a white van passes and someone shouts &quot; Migra , migra , Border_Patrol , Border Patrol. &quot; Mouths and forks jerk to a stop . False alarm . Everything returns to normal . Later in the afternoon , the entire camp comes_to the party in the clearing outside the Carbajal canton and restaurant , a pink structure with a roof made from cardboard vegetable boxes and plastic sheets . A blue tarp shades the dirt dance_floor that ' s been hosed to keep the dust down . Ramiro sets_up speakers , microphone and amplifier near the front_door . Slugging back beers , their heels sinking_in the damp dirt , the men form a wall around the dance_floor . Roughly 12 men for every eligible woman , dozens cue up_to dance . Some will wait as long as half an hour before they get their chance to ask Elva or the others to dance and , when they do , it is with a dash of country formality-hat in_hand and a brief bow . Elva ' s uncle asks Ramiro to sing a favorite song : I wander through life traveling and if you must know , I ' ll tell you that I ' m a free_spirit , A soul without an owner . I let nothing bother me . for me , life is a dream . I drink when I want to-I don ' t deny it for I am an honest man . I go like the seagulls , flying from port to port . I know life is short and that I ' m in debt . But the day I die , I can ' t take anything with me . Yes , one has to enjoy this life that ends all too soon . Whatever happens in this world , only our memories remain . When I ' m dead , I can take nothing more_than a fistful of dirt . The children break a pinata with a broom handle , scattering hard_candy on the ground . Elva ' s mother calls groups of men into the kitchen to enjoy the pig that was killed for the occasion . Dona Asuncion and the older married_women sit in a row on the edge of the dance_floor near a three tiered cake and a_few boxed of presents . The back of the cake has melted from the sun . That afternoon , Don Cidronio , Dona Adelina and their son had packed their belonging and moved_into a rent-subsidized , two-bedroom duplex in Linda vista , 30 minutes away . The apartment has a flush_toilet and a gas_range the first that any of them have ever had . halfway through the party , Don Cidronio returns and stands at the edge of the crowd , belonging yet somehow gone . It is not that he misses the rancho . He returns because it is all he returns because it is all he knows of America , so out of whack from the dream . Perhaps he has to return before he can accept another version of el norte . Princess for a day , Elva medina smiles at the crowd of men who sing &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; as she slices_into the sagging cake . to the west , blocking the falling sun , a rainbow-colored hot_air balloon lands in a field . One side reads , &quot; Another Beautiful Day in San Diego. &quot; * The First Bulldozers started coming_in September . By the first week of November , all_of Rancho de los Diablos had been razed . Elva and her family now live_in a new apartment complex in Escondido . Don Arnulfo , Dona Asuncion and their family moved to San Diego . Don Cidronio ' s family continues to live_in Linda Vista . Felipe , like many of the younger_men , went_to Alabama to look_for work in the poultry packing_plants where , at $ 5 an hour , the pay is a little better . Ramiro continues to sleep_in the back of his car . The other single men , who qualified under the relocation program for only one month ' s rental assistance , have decided to take their chances in the_hills and valleys . With scrap wood from the old camp , they ' ve erected a new camp to the west , closer to the Ukegawa fields . They ' ve named it Rancho de los Diablos .</TEXT>
