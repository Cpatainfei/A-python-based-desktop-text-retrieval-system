   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : THE REMAINS OF THE BIRD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The romance of leftover turkey begins to fade a_few days after the feast . First pickings bring pleasure , but what about the rest ? Before you do anything else with the leftover turkey , find the little morsels of meat called the oysters . They are_on the underside of the turkey , right in the center , at the base of the backbone . There are two , one straddling either side of the bone . Each oyster is about two bites of the tenderest , most succulent dark_meat on the whole bird . They ' re the reason that I offer to carve the turkey every year -- so I ' m assured that no one else beats me to them . Now the strategy for the rest of the bird : Cooked turkey will stay fresher if it ' s left on the bone until you use it . Once it ' s cut , it dries_out more quickly . The turkey must be wrapped airtight , either in a plastic food bag or foil . If your refrigerator space is limited , cut_off the legs and wings and wrap them separately . Leftovers can be refrigerated up_to four days . You might consider freezing some sliced or chopped turkey meat ( also the carcass ) until you can face it with renewed enthusiasm . Wrap in foil , then seal_in an airtight food bag ( to prevent off-odors and freezer burn ) and label clearly . The meat can be frozen up_to two months . It ' s best to thaw , still wrapped , in the refrigerator . * Before you go_for this long-term strategy , however , consider the following recipes : Asian turkey salad , broiled open-face turkey sandwiches with mushrooms and cheese and turkey-vegetable soup with orzo . They are easy preparations -- and unlike most typical post-Thanksgiving leftovers , they don ' t require cranberry_sauce . * This is a quick salad to get_on the table . It ' s also the perfect sequel to Thanksgiving dinner because it ' s light and refreshing . ASIAN TURKEY SALAD 1 medium clove garlic 1 ( 1-inch square ) piece ginger root 6 tablespoons rice vinegar 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons sesame_oil 2 cups diced cooked turkey 2 / 3 cup packaged fine dried rice noodles ( rice sticks ) , deep-fried 2 / 3 cup diced celery 2 / 3 cup diced sweet red_pepper 2 / 3 cup thinly sliced green_onions 2 cups chopped iceberg_lettuce Finely mince garlic and ginger in blender or food_processor . Scrape down sides of container . Add vinegar , honey and oil . Mix well . Set_aside . Put turkey , fried_rice noodles , celery , sweet red_pepper and green_onions in 2-quart bowl . Add dressing .

BROILED OPEN-FACE TURKEY SANDWICH WITH CHEESE AND MUSHROOMS 4 slices challah or brioche bread Dijon mustard Sauteed Mushrooms 8 full slices turkey breast meat 6 ounces Muenster or Monterey Jack cheese , sliced thin Generously spread 1 side of each bread slice with mustard . Spread Sauteed Mushrooms evenly over mustard-covered side of each bread slice , about 1 / 3 cup per slice . Top each with 2 turkey slices . Top with cheese slices , about 1 1 / 2 ounces on each .

Sauteed Mushrooms 1 1 / 2 tablespoons olive_oil 1 1 / 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 2 large cloves garlic , thinly sliced 1 pound mushrooms , trimmed , sliced 1 / 4 cup beef_stock or broth 1 / 4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 4 medium green_onions , thinly sliced Heat oil and butter in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat . When hot , add garlic and mushrooms . Cook , uncovered , mushrooms , about 3 minutes , stirring often . Add beef_stock , salt and pepper to taste . Simmer until mushrooms are just tender but still have texture , about 2 minutes . Add green_onions . Toss until well-combined . Remove from heat . * This is a thick and sustaining soup that makes a great supper . The depth of the broth flavor -- from the turkey stock used as a base -- makes the soup . Serve with biscuits or cornbread . If you want , you can tackle the soup a_few weeks after Thanksgiving , following the freezing instructions in the story above .
