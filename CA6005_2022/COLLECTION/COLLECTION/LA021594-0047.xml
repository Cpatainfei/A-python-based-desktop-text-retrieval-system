   <TEXT> Because he won the Olympic downhill , everyone wants a piece of Tommy Moe . Make that an exclusive , please . Tom Kelly , director of media relations for the U.S. ski team , is trying to be diplomatic . Monday night , Kelly had to deny interview requests from Norwegian and German national broadcast networks . &quot; They didn ' t take it well , &quot; Kelly said . Problem is , there ' s only one Moe to go_around . Sunday was a whirlwind . Moe didn ' t wrap_up his day until 10 p.m. He did two separate interviews with print reporters , three segments for CBS and a live spot with CBS ' &quot; This Morning. &quot; Monday morning , after five hours ' sleep , he finished third in the downhill portion of the Alpine combined . Later , he had to cancel a scheduled television spot with TNT because of a training schedule change for the men ' s Super-G . Nothing like a ski_race to mess_up a television career . * For winning the gold , Moe will receive $ 15 # 000 from the U.S. Olympic Committee . &quot; All right ! &quot; said Moe , who wasn ' t aware of the USOC ' s cash prize schedule . &quot; Thanks for that news . that ' s pretty surprising . It made my whole day. &quot; * Moe , an Olympic champion for less than 48 hours , already pines for the days when he can rest_on his laurels . &quot; I was down in New Zealand this summer and I saw Franz Klammer and Bill Johnson and a lot of the top skiers from the past , &quot; he said . &quot; And they were smoking cigars and having a good time , and I said , ' that ' s the way to do_it . Retire from ski racing and go play golf and smoke a cigar. ' &quot; * AJ Kitt , who finished 17th in Sunday ' s downhill , did not race in Monday ' s combined downhill . He will ski in Thursday ' s Super-G , then return home to rest before the World Cup races in North_America next month . &quot; He didn ' t have a good downhill here , but I ' m not going_to give_up on the guy , &quot; said Ueli Luthi , the U.S men ' s coach . Kitt has long been the most consistent U.S. downhill racer , and remains the only American to have won a World Cup downhill since Bill Johnson in 1984 . Kitt also won the bronze medal in last year ' s World Championships . But even Kitt knows that in America , they only remember Olympic champions . * Luthi said Moe ' s downhill success will be a tremendous boost for the U.S. team , which has been under_fire of late . &quot; It was a great victory , &quot; Luthi said . &quot; It came at the right time . It was one of the first Olympic events , Mrs . Clinton was here . The political side kind of zoomed in on our sport . There were not 200 other sports going_on . The benefits will be great. &quot; CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
