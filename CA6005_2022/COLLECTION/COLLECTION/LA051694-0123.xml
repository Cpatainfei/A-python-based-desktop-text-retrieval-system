   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; WARHOL GETS HIS DUE IN PITTSBURGH ; MUSEUM IS LARGEST IN U.S. DEDICATED TO A SINGLE ARTIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the early 1960s , Andy Warhol used the concepts and techniques of mass-media advertising to repackage and sell established American ideas about art . His Pop was heard ' round the world . Starting today , three decades and a wholesale artistic revolution later , Warhol ' s remarkable achievement has been enshrined in a splendid new museum , billed as the most comprehensive in the nation devoted to the work of a single artist . Located in the Pennsylvania city of his birth ( he died_unexpectedly on Feb . 22 , 1987 , following routine gall-bladder surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical_Center ) , the museum radiates an all-American theme : Hometown boy makes_good . Warhol was born in this former urban-industrial powerhouse on Aug . 6 , 1928 , the third son of Andrej and Julia Zavacky Warhola . Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants , the Warholas had left the rugged foothills of Eastern Europe , along with fully half the region ' s population in the 20 years flanking the turn of the 20th Century , in search of the proverbial better life . Many , like Warhol ' s father , found it in the mines and mills of Pennsylvania . The museum , with its yet-to-be fully opened archival center , will likely become the primary locus for Warhol studies . Two main questions have surrounded its genesis . First , would the museum ' s art_collection include enough first-rate examples to justify the building renovation budget ( $ 12.3 million ) and the establishment of a suitable endowment ( $ 20 million ) ? Second , in what light would his 40-year career be presented ? * Certainly the museum is an exquisite package for Warhol ' s art . The ornate Beaux Arts structure , built_in 1911 and clad in glazed terra_cotta , has been discretely joined by a beautiful three-story addition of concrete , black-glazed structural tile and standard yellow brick -- the kind commonly used in old , working-class Pittsburgh . Yellow brick , given its glancing associations with Dorothy Gale traipsing through Oz , is perfect for a Warhol shrine . Architect Richard Gluckman , best known for his elegantly low-key renovation of loft-building galleries for the Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan , has followed_suit here . Unabashedly modernist , the spare , clean spaces are finished in industrially refined materials such_as concrete , aluminum , stainless_steel , glass and ocher-colored plaster . A grand staircase backed by a seven-story wall of translucent glass that floods the interior with filtered light creates a passageway both beautifully inviting and useful : You orient yourself with ease inside the 88 # 000-square-foot building . Gluckman has allowed himself one grand flourish . At the entrance , visitors cross an enclosed bridge to the spacious public lobby , arrayed with 25 Warhol self-portraits in a variety of mediums . The bridge , featuring a concrete floor , deep indigo walls and silver-leaf ceiling , gradually narrows in a Brunelleschi-style forced perspective . It subtly echoes the short walk to the museum from the city ' s center , across a bridge spanning the Allegheny River . A glass wall with double_doors at the bridge ' s narrow end features structural aluminum mullions that create an unobtrusive ( but unmistakable ) cross , beneath which visitors pass . This processional space enacts a ritualized transition from a mundane urban street on Pittsburgh ' s north_side into a modern temple to art , mausoleum for an artist . The museum ' s location , its renovated building and useful didactic panels strikingly underscore how Warhol ' s Catholic , working class , first-generation American upbringing is critical to understanding his art . In a studio he pointedly called the Factory , Warhol was a modern laborer who mass-produced works_of_art that dissected -- and contributed to -- the popular culture of consumption that distinguishes the 20th Century from all others . Smartly , director Tom Armstrong and curator Mark Francis haven ' t separated the artist ' s many mediums in the display : advertisements and magazine graphics of the 1950s , which first brought Warhol success as a commercial_artist in New York ; the brilliant silk-screened paintings , prints and sculptures that brought him art-world fame as a Pop avatar ; the extraordinary movies that increasingly occupied him in the late 1960s ; the rock_band , the Velvet Underground , which he actively promoted , and his disco-decor wallpaper and floating silver pillows ; and the fan-magazine , Interview , still published today . In the museum , everything intersects with everything else in a radically democratic manner . If the crucial socioeconomic context for Warhol ' s art is wonderfully conveyed , however , its other defining circumstance is regrettably ignored . Sexuality is often a crucible in which art ' s character is formed , but in the Pittsburgh museum the artist ' s homosexuality is not acknowledged . Imagine the Picasso Museum in Paris keeping_mum about the critical relation between the Spaniard ' s heterosexual appetites and his aesthetic , and you ' ll have some idea of the egregiousness of the omission . Take the silk-screened paintings , sine_qua_non of Pop art , in which photographs are reproduced in paint on canvas , often highlighted with splashes of color . Warhol hit on a sly way to make photographs masquerade as paintings : They ' re photographs in drag , complete with makeup enabling them to pass in fashionable society . Before Warhol , photography had been a second-class citizen in art . Camera images had revolutionized the modern visual environment , but they traditionally occupied a lower rung than painting in art ' s established hierarchy . Warhol turned the tables . The equivalence to his own situation as a homosexual , and thus an actual second-class citizen , is more_than mere coincidence . The museum ' s collection numbers about 900 paintings , 70 sculptures , 1 # 500 drawings , exhibition prints of all his films and videos , rolls of his wallpaper , and more_than 500 prints and 400 black-and-white photographs . Together with the commercial_art and sketchbooks from the 1950s , they were contributed by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts , which represents the artist ' s estate , and the Dia Center , who , with Pittsburgh ' s Carnegie Institute , have collaborated to create the museum . Much of Warhol ' s greatest work is already in other museums and private collections , but the 500 works in Pittsburgh ' s inaugural show nonetheless offer a generally substantive , sometimes superb display . Evidence of weakness is usually one of size : Smaller examples are abundant , but they don ' t always convey the &quot; mass-ness &quot; of mass production that such larger canvases as the 11 silver portraits of Elvis do effortlessly carry . Five judicious loans to the inaugural installation also help : a hand-painted Dick Tracy , the classic &quot; Before and After &quot; ad for a nose_job , a rare paint-by-numbers image , a monumental portrait of Mao and 55 of the mysterious pictures of shadows and light playing in the corner of an empty room . The strongest showings are_on the sixth and fifth floors , which chronicle the dazzling connections among the commercial_art , the early Pop works and the evolution of the Factory . Warhol ' s great films ( continuously projected on video ) are wonderfully integrated into a gallery filled with portraits of media stars , from Marilyn to Jackie . The flimsiest display is_on the second floor . Warhol ' s muddled , often corny work from the late 1970s and 1980s includes gruesome attempts at collaboration with Francesco Clemente and the late Jean-Michel Basquiat . Warhol ' s tragic death at age 59 voided the possibility of a convincing late period . If the installation thus ends with a whimper , no matter . Warhol ' s own late work might be flimsy , but it ' s impossible even to imagine the 1980s at all -- bad and good -- without his astonishing precedent . * Andy Warhol Museum , 117 Sandusky St. , Pittsburgh , ( 412 ) 237-8338 ; closed Mondays and Tuesdays , except during the inaugural week .</TEXT>
