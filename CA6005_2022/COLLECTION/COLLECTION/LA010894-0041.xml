   <HEADLINE> THE WEST AND BOSNIA : WHAT NOW ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last April the U.N. Security_Council voted to establish &quot; safe areas &quot; around Muslim enclaves threatened by Serb forces in Bosnia . But according to the commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces , although a minimum of 7 # 500 troops was needed to implement the resolution only 2 # 000 were ever sent . Belgian Lt . Gen . Francis Briquemont resigned in protest last week as Serbian forces outside Sarajevo renewed their shelling of the ravaged city . Europe ' s attempt to restore peace to the Balkans has been , in recent months , a British-French effort with the_British leading the diplomacy and the_French commanding the troops . Lord David Owen , representing the European Union , has served as principal mediator among the warring parties . Gen . Jean Cot is in_charge of the overall 26 # 000-member U.N. Protection Force . Within that force , Briquemont and before him French Lt . Gen . Philippe Morillon , who was forced_out for excessive boldness , have commanded the 12 # 000-member peacekeeping force . Their indignation seems to be having a belated and unexpected impact in Paris . French Foreign Minister Francois Leotard is reportedly seeking the support of the Clinton_Administration for a military intervention on behalf of the besieged towns of Tuzla and Srebenica . And new calls are being heard for NATO air strikes against Serbian mortar positions around Sarajevo -- action that the West once promised in the event of a strangulation of the Bosnian capital . Lord Owen , meanwhile , has warned the combatants -- above all , the vulnerable Bosnians -- that if they do not accept his latest peace plan the U.N. troops may withdraw . Owen ' s view , apparently shared by British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , is that the Clinton_Administration has sabotaged the peace process precisely by holding_out the vain prospect of such an intervention as the_French may now propose . Owen has said , &quot; If George_Bush had won the American elections last year , then the war in Bosnia would have been over long ago. &quot; Oversimplifying slightly , then , the choice between Leotard and Owen is the choice between up and out . But what does Bosnia want ? Bosnia , needless to say , would welcome a military rescue . Failing that , however , the arms embargo of Bosnia must go . It has been defended on two grounds : first , that it would prevent the violence from spreading ; second , that without this demonstration of neutrality the Serbs might turn_on U.N. forces . If and when the U.N. peacekeepers withdraw , those arguments , always weak , will collapse . In truth , they have already collapsed . The violence has already spread . The Serbs are already attacking the U.N. forces . Whether or not French President Francois Mitterrand proposes military intervention to President Clinton at the European summit in Brussels , surely the two can agree that there remains no reason why the Bosnians may_not arm for their own defense .</TEXT>
