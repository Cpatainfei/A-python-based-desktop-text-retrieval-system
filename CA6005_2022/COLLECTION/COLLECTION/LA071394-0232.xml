   <TEXT> Early last year , a retired Swedish civil_servant was arrested during a police raid in the beach resort of Pattaya and charged with molesting a 13-year-old boy in his hotel_room . As is common in prosecutions involving child prostitution in Asia , the case never went_to trial . Instead , the 66-year-old Swede , Bengt Bolin , was released on $ 4 # 000 bail and fled the country . Because Sweden has no extradition treaty with Thailand , it appeared that his legal problems were over . After Bolin arrived in Sweden , however , he received a shock . State Prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem called Bolin in and informed him that he was being officially investigated -- the formal stage before prosecution -- for violating Sweden ' s own child molestation law with his activities in Thailand . It is the first time Swedish authorities have contemplated using the 30-year-old law for crimes involving children overseas , Alhem says . While Bolin maintains his innocence and prosecutors are still awaiting key evidence from Thailand before proceeding , the case has become the opening skirmish in a novel , worldwide legal battle to curb the flourishing trade_in child prostitutes . In the past year , Germany , France and Australia have proposed tough legal measures to discourage their citizens from traveling abroad for child prostitution . In the United States , Senate and House versions of a law on child_abuse overseas have been sent to a joint congressional committee along with the rest of the current crime bill . Child prostitution is one of the saddest scourges in developing Asia . Every year , thousands of men from Western Europe , the United States and Australia fly into Southeast_Asia in search of children , both boys and girls , as sex partners or to use in pornography . Some poor parents in developing countries sell their children into a kind of slavery , while governments desperate for tourist dollars turn_a_blind_eye . Previously , efforts to control the trade have largely been a pitiful failure because of corruption . Now , however , efforts around the world have been galvanized in a campaign to adopt strict laws in the so-called consumer countries to discourage men from venturing overseas for underage sex . The international campaign is being spearheaded by a small group called End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism , which was founded in Bangkok in 1990 during an international conference on tourism . It has offices in 26 countries . &quot; Our goal is to let people know that if they want a child prostitute in Thailand or elsewhere in Asia that they are doing something illegal , &quot; said Sudarat S . Srisang , a Thai social_worker who became ECPAT ' s executive_director . &quot; Before , there was this attitude that it was OK , that there was an acceptance in this part of the world . Well , it ' s no longer OK. &quot; Although precise statistics are not available , ECPAT estimates that nearly 1 million children are involved in Asia ' s sex trade , including 300 # 000 to 400 # 000 in India , 200 # 000 to 300 # 000 in Thailand , 100 # 000 each in the Philippines and Taiwan , 40 # 000 in Vietnam and 30 # 000 in Sri Lanka . A recent report suggested that war-devastated Cambodia , which has few enforceable laws , is fast becoming a haven for child prostitution . * The proposed U.S. law would expand the Mann Act , which makes_it an offense to travel across state_lines for immoral purposes , to make_it a felony to travel outside the United States to engage in any sexual act with a minor that would be illegal in America . It would also be illegal for Americans to traffic in child pornography overseas . Enforced by a special Justice_Department office , the proposal calls_for punishment of 10 years ' imprisonment for a first offense and 20 years for a second offense . Civil liberties advocates had initially questioned whether it was legal to try someone in the United States for a crime committed overseas . But legal_experts said this concept of &quot; extraterritoriality &quot; has been upheld in such cases as the one against former Panamanian leader Gen . Manuel A . Noriega , who was tried and convicted in Miami on eight counts of racketeering , conspiracy and cocaine-smuggling . &quot; It is outrageous that U.S. citizens are allowed to travel abroad to engage in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors that would be illegal in the United States and that U.S. ( travel ) agencies organize and advertise such laws , &quot; Rep . Joseph Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , one of the bill ' s sponsors , testified at a House committee hearing in March . &quot; U.S. citizens and tour agencies should not be allowed to fuel an international industry that results in the physical and psychological abuse of tens of thousands of children . The damaging consequences of this abuse can last a lifetime. &quot; Late last year , Germany enacted a law providing_for prison sentences of up_to 10 years for any German who engages in sexual practices with a child younger than 14 , even if the crime takes_place in a foreign country . France also adopted punitive measures , while Britain promised to provide Asian_countries with lists of known British pedophiles so they can be kept_out by immigration officials . One of the most sweeping proposals was adopted by the lower house of Australia ' s Parliament earlier this year and is awaiting passage by the upper house . It provides_for up_to 14 years ' imprisonment for cases involving children younger than 12 and up_to seven years ' imprisonment for those involving youngsters between 13 and 16 . The Australian proposal would become one of that country ' s few &quot; extraterritorial &quot; criminal_laws ; the others include war_crimes . Among its novel features is a provision to allow testimony to be given by satellite television hookup , which was initially criticized by civil_liberties groups concerned that defendants would forfeit a traditional right to confront a witness . &quot; While we do not expect large_numbers of prosecutions , the law sends a message that this country will not tolerate its citizens going offshore to abuse the children of other countries , &quot; Mark Lever , an aide to Australian Atty . Gen . Michael Lavarch , said in a telephone_interview . In some countries , the problem involves mature-looking teen-age girls who become prostitutes while below the legal_age of consent . But in other places , customers are specifically looking_for children younger than 12 , or even 10 . Some men believe , for instance , that sex with_children will give them longevity , while others hope , equally incorrectly , that choosing a child as a sexual partner will decrease the risk of contracting the virus that causes AIDS . Others are hard-core pedophiles . &quot; Tourism is providing the context in which the child_abuse exists , &quot; said Ron O ' Grady , a New Zealand native who was one of the original founders of ECPAT . &quot; You often find that the farther a traveler gets_away from home , the more they lose restraints. &quot; The beaches of Sri Lanka are renowned haunts of European pedophiles looking_for pre-adolescent boys . In the Philippine town of Angeles , which is_on the outskirts of the former U.S. military facility Clark Air_Base , bars advertise prostitutes whom the barkeepers guarantee are virgins . &quot; Put_in a family context , if a man has_sex with a 15-year-old or a 10-year-old the damage is equal , &quot; said the Rev . Shay Cullen , an Irish priest who has worked with street children in the Philippines for 25 years . * ECPAT has focused_on enacting laws in the &quot; consumer &quot; nations because only a handful of cases have been successfully prosecuted in Asia , although the number is starting to grow . More often than not , when foreign men are accused of sex crimes with_children in an Asian_country , they either pay a bribe or flee while on bail . Once they return home , most offenders are safe from being extradited because Western governments tend not to send their citizens back to face trial in another country unless it has a Western-style judicial_system and civil_liberties , which few Asian_nations do . The new child sex laws will replace extradition by providing_for cases to be heard in the accused ' s home countries , with local safeguards , but using testimony and evidence gathered abroad . Officials believe most cases will involve instances in which an accused was arrested in Asia but managed to return home before being brought_to trial . &quot; They have big problems with_child prostitution here , so it is important for us to show them how important it is for us , &quot; said Per Olov Forslund , a Swedish detective who is assigned to his country ' s Bangkok embassy to gather information on child prostitution . Thai Prime_Minister Chuan Leekpai made the elimination of child prostitution his top priority shortly after he took_office in September , 1992 . After a series of well-publicized police raids , the trade_in very young children moved_out of the open in nightclubs and into the shadows , but it still persists on a large scale . &quot; It ' s nice talk , but it ' s just talk , &quot; Sanphasit Koompraphant , director of the Center for the Protection of Children ' s Rights in Bangkok , said of Chuan ' s efforts to crack_down . Sanphasit asserted that Chuan had reneged_on a pledge to make local officials resign in areas where child prostitution proliferates . &quot; Despite clear evidence of direct official involvement in every stage of the trafficking process , not a single Thai officer , to our knowledge , has been investigated or prosecuted except in one highly publicized case of murder , &quot; said a recent study by New York-based Human_Rights Watch of Thailand ' s trade_in young_girls from neighboring Myanmar . &quot; For the most part , agents , pimps , brothel owners and clients have also been exempt from punishment. &quot; In a speech last month , Chuan said that child prostitution had become a &quot; transnational trade involving powerful organizations which have a close-knit network. &quot; But he also charged that the problem was being blown_out of proportion by the news media . Chuan ' s government has proposed a significant toughening of the child prostitution laws , which is still awaiting passage in Parliament . But social_workers and officials agree that the problem is lack of enforcement , not a lack of laws . In the Philippines , for example , stringent laws against sex with_children were adopted in 1992 . But officials acknowledge that the laws have not been used . &quot; It is rumored that the Philippine National Police is very corrupt , &quot; said Santiago Y . Toledo , deputy director of the National Bureau of Investigation , the local version of the FBI . &quot; Besides , you almost never get a girl to file a complaint . They just disappear. &quot; * One of the most blatant examples of sex tourism in Asia can be found in Angeles , which suffered the departure of 20 # 000 U.S. servicemen from Clark Air_Base and was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mt . Pinatubo in 1991 . Even though there are no beaches , nearby mountains or any scenery to speak_of , the number of bars in the town has doubled to 173 since October thanks to an influx of single men , largely from Australia and Germany , but also including a sizable number of Americans . &quot; We hate the fact that our survival depends_on these young_girls , &quot; said Carlito M . Ganzo , an Angeles city councilman . &quot; But we cannot do anything . It ' s an economic reality. &quot; American Max Rose , who runs an Angeles bar known as Platinum , said the girls working in the bars were licensed by the government as being over 18 and there was nothing the bar owners could do about it . He added that by giving licenses , the government in fact &quot; condoned &quot; prostitution . Any notion that the girls are working as &quot; entertainers &quot; is dispelled by the requirements of the government license : a yearly test for HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- and weekly checkups for venereal_disease . Romega Anteola , a social_worker with a women ' s rights group in Angeles , said the government requires no proof of_age when it issues licenses , and she estimated that the majority of bar_girls are younger than 18 when they start working . &quot; The truth is , they come at the age of 14 and 15 , &quot; she said . A stroll along Angeles ' main_street one recent night tended to support her argument : There were scores of middle-aged Caucasian males walking hand in_hand with teen-age Philippine girls , some barely half their size . Cullen , the Catholic priest working with street children in Olongapo , near the former U.S. naval base at Subic Bay , said he believes that 50 % of the women working in that city ' s bars are underage . Cullen is outspoken in his criticism of the U.S. Navy for allowing servicemen arrested as child abusers to escape the Philippines , and in some cases , he said , abetting their escape . Cullen estimated that during the 10 years before the U.S. military departed in November , 1992 , there were 150 child_abuse accusations against U.S. servicemen and all were dismissed at a preliminary stage because the accused had left the country on &quot; unauthorized leave. &quot; Earlier this year , Cullen brought a child_abuse case against an Australian who allegedly abused children aboard a private yacht anchored offshore from Cullen ' s offices , known as the Preda Foundation . Some of the children involved were the same ones who had been involved in a child prostitution case involving a U.S. sailor . Cullen , who traveled_to Tokyo in May to campaign for the adoption of extraterritorial child sex laws being considered by Japan ' s Parliament , acknowledged that there would be difficulty making a case overseas but said the obstacles were more_than offset by the benefits . &quot; It will be a great point of education , &quot; he said . &quot; People will realize that they may be caught . It will be a great deterrent against ever leaving home. &quot;</TEXT>
