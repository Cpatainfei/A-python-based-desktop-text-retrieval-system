   <TEXT> Their problems seem overwhelming ; the marriage , hopeless . Still , they wish they could make_it work . It ' s really quite striking , given how miserable they ' ve been , how easily the problems of many such couples can be solved . that ' s the hopeful message from psychology professors and marital therapists Clifford Notarius and Howard Markman , who have made careers of studying what it is that makes marriages work . Notarius , of the Catholic University of America , and Markman , of the University of Denver , are authors of &quot; We Can Work It Out : Making_Sense of Marital Conflict &quot; ( Putnam , $ 21.95 ) . &quot; Once you figure_out what ' s gone_wrong , it ' s not too difficult , if you ' re motivated , to fix it , &quot; Markman says . &quot; We try to provide a road map on how to do that. &quot; * The book is an effort &quot; to convey to people why marriages work , why they don ' t work -- really give people an understanding of the research . &quot; It ' s kind of nice , &quot; he says , &quot; because what the science is showing &quot; is not that marriages fail because of personality factors , or such things as age differences . &quot; It ' s not things that are hard to change that seem to be at the heart of marital problems , &quot; Markman says . Rather , the critical factors are how well couples communicate , and whether they can agree on ways to handle the conflicts that are inevitable in any intimate relationship . Markman and Notarius find &quot; six simple truths of marriage &quot; : * Each relationship contains a reservoir of hope . &quot; We find that most partners retain their wish for relationship improvement even when the going is toughest &quot; -- a source of great potential . The problem is that people ' s attempts to improve things often have destructive effects . * One &quot; zinger &quot; will erase 20 acts of kindness . &quot; Our research has shown that it takes one put-down to undo hours of kindness you give to your partner . . . . Intimate partners must learn how to manage their anger and control the exchange of negative behavior. &quot; * Little changes in you can lead to huge changes in the relationship . &quot; Add to your relationship acts of thoughtful kindness -- compliment your partner on how he or she looks , touch your partner ' s back when you walk by -- and subtract from your relationship acts of thoughtless nastiness -- ignoring your partner when you are angry , calling your partner names . &quot; As you live and breathe this formula , you can rediscover and preserve feelings of love , attraction and satisfaction in your relationship. &quot; * It ' s not the differences between partners that cause problems but how the differences are handled when they arise . &quot; Rather than focusing_on areas of agreement and disagreement , partners in happy relationships develop good listening skills . . . ( which ) involve understanding and acceptance of differences in personality and taste . Having a good listener is having a good friend . In a happy relationship , a partner can count_on his or her mate ' s being a good friend and never a judge or counselor. &quot; * Men and women fight using different weapons but suffer similar wounds . For various reasons , men often have a harder_time handling conflict , and women have a harder_time tolerating emotional distance , Markman and Notarius write . When couples learn to monitor and contain their responses , they learn to work together to achieve the closeness that both partners want . * Partners need to practice relationship skills to become good at them . &quot; Partners enter into relationships with no agreed-upon rules or skills for handling the strong negative feelings that are an inevitable part of all relationships . Without rules , in the face of conflict , partners often resort_to forms of guerrilla warfare with random sniping that can seriously wound their mates . Instead of taking_control of conflict , partners let conflict take_control of them. &quot; &quot; We find that many people are motivated to work_on their relationship , &quot; Markman says . &quot; They just don ' t know exactly what to do. &quot;</TEXT>
