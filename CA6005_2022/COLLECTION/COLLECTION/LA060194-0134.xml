   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO GIANTS MAY TURN TO BANKRUPTCY , EXPERTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cigarette makers , among the most profitable U.S. companies , may end_up turning_to the bankruptcy courts for protection against an expected surge in smoking-related lawsuits , legal_experts say . Last week two states took steps against tobacco producers to make them pay_for health costs arising from smoking . Philip Morris Cos . and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . played_down the chances of taking the bankruptcy route . But lawyers see a chance for a repeat of the move that saved asbestos makers from the worst financial effects of cancer-related lawsuits . &quot; Tobacco companies are very healthy . They ' re robust . Yet they could find themselves contemplating bankruptcy if civil lawsuits turn against them , &quot; said Elizabeth Warren , who teaches bankruptcy law at the University of Pennsylvania . Another law professor , Daniel Polsby of Northwestern University , likens the companies ' current situation to &quot; a balloon in a room full of needles. &quot; Lawyers said the situation is reminiscent_of the flood of asbestos-injury lawsuits that pushed Manville Corp. , until then financially healthy , into filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982 . The company had been called Johns-Manville when it made asbestos . Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , a company retains control of its businesses while it reorganizes and settles debts with its creditors . Such bankruptcy protection can also be used to shelter a company ' s assets from massive legal claims , as occurred in the case of Manville , which is again financially sound . For tobacco companies , such a move could be years away and depends_on whether the manufacturers start losing cases . But just a_few defeats for the once-invincible industry could lead to a rapid preemptive strike , the legal_experts predict . &quot; You ' ll see them contemplating bankruptcy when they ' ve lost only a_few lawsuits if they perceive on the horizon there are literally tens of thousands of lawsuits . It will be an anticipatory move , a strategy , &quot; Warren said . But a spokesman for Philip Morris said the company does not think it will lose any of the civil actions and that the industry ' s situation is not comparable_to that of asbestos makers ' . Manville emerged from bankruptcy in 1988 after pioneering the use of bankruptcy protection to set_up a trust to pay massive personal injury claims . A.H. Robins Co. , which made the ill-fated Dalkon Shield contraceptive_device , took a similar route when it filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 . &quot; Johns-Manville and Robins have simply blazed the path for how to do that in a mass tort situation . This would be an ideal setting &quot; for tobacco companies , Warren said . Victor Han , the Philip Morris spokesman , said tobacco companies are not at the same risk because they have never paid a penny stemming from a judgment against them . He said the state actions are fundamentally the same as other cases the industry has won .</TEXT>
