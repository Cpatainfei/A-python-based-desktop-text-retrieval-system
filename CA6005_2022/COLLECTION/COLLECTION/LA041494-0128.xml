   <HEADLINE> RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY KEY CANCER GENE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A key gene that normally suppresses cancer has been identified by researchers , offering an important new focus for treating the disease , scientists reported Wednesday . Loss of the gene was detected in a broad range of cancers , including 60 % of breast_cancer cases and 82 % of one type of brain_tumor . &quot; It ' s very close to the action of cell_division . When it ' s broken , destroyed ( or ) mutated , cell_division is left_out of control , &quot; said Dr. Mark Skolnik of the University of Utah Medical_Center . The newly identified tumor-suppressing gene , called p16 , appears even more significant than the previously identified p53 gene , which is believed to be a major factor_in fighting colon , breast , liver and other cancers , said Alexander Kamb of Utah-based Myriad Genetics Inc. , who helped lead the p16 research . The p16 gene controls the production of an enzyme that inhibits cell growth in cancer genes and p53 does not , he said . Cancer researchers are increasingly turning their attention to suppressor genes , which brake uncontrolled cell_division . Damage to these suppressor cells -- by chemicals in cigarette smoke , ultraviolet_light , radiation or other carcinogens -- may be the chief cause of cancer , Kamb said at the annual meeting of the American Assn . for Cancer Research , in San Francisco . P16 may_not be the &quot; magic_bullet &quot; that ties all cancers together , but it is a major step , Kamb said . &quot; It looks really promising as a major player in human cancers , &quot; he said . Discovery of the p16 gene -- called MTS1 by the Utah team -- was first announced by David Beach of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York late last year . The Utah team researched the gene ' s role in fighting tumors and is publishing its findings in the Friday issue of Science .</TEXT>
