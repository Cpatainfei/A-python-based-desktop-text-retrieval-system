   <HEADLINE> DANA PARSONS : that ' s RIGHT , O.C. CONSERVATISM NEARS THE MAINSTREAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A group of students and faculty at Chapman University asked me to speak this week at their Social_Science Forum , suggesting as the subject &quot; Orange County at Year ' s End. &quot; After a lame opening joke about Orange County at year ' s end being the same as at year ' s beginning -- partly cloudy skies with highs in the 70s and little chance of rain -- I tried to get serious . The joke was meant to suggest that things don ' t change much around here , and I went_on to say that just like the weather , Orange County politics remains as predictably conservative as ever . But where Orange County ' s political conservatism was dismissed a generation ago as a local aberration and frequent embarrassment , it now can claim some legitimacy . To paraphrase an old expression , if Orange County politics aren ' t exactly mainstream , at least you can see mainstream from here . That was not always true . In the 1960s , a cadre of conservative Republican state and national officeholders gave Orange County a reputation as a watering_hole for some very strange birds not seen in other climes . Even Richard Nixon gave them pause . Nixon archives include a letter he received in 1962 from Walter Knott ( of Berry Farm fame ) while Nixon was running_for governor of California . &quot; We will do everything we can to help you win in November , &quot; Knott wrote , &quot; but it would make our work much easier in Orange County if you would lay off the John Birch Society and refrain_from depreciating the conservative movement. &quot; Earlier that year , Nixon wrote to Orange County Congressman James Utt , expressing his fear for the &quot; disastrous effect which the makeup of the John Birch Society , because of its totalitarian makeup and acknowledged leader , can have_on Republican candidates. &quot; That disastrous effect was lost on local voters , who later sent a Bircher to Congress . For years , local figures like that relegated Orange County to a punch_line . Now , as the country has become more conservative and the delegation as_a_whole is less extreme , the county becomes much more interesting as a gauge of the national mind-set . At first glance , some recent polls suggest that Orange County is still a conservative stride ahead of the rest of the country . For example , local pollster Mark Baldassare found that 46 % of Orange County residents consider themselves &quot; very conservative &quot; or &quot; conservative , &quot; compared with a nationwide figure of 39 % . However , when you combine the more mainstream categories of &quot; conservative &quot; and &quot; moderate &quot; from that same poll , 72 % of Orange County residents identified themselves as one or the other . The comparable figure nationwide was 71 % , suggesting that Orange County no longer operates in a parallel political universe . The question that follows is , what direction will this 72 % want to go ? For starters , will the anti-illegal immigrant issue that flowered in Orange County take_hold elsewhere ? Two out of three Orange County residents voted for Proposition 187 , higher than the statewide average . Will that reflect the larger national view if , for example , a similar proposal goes before voters in Texas and Florida ? In that same vein , the Baldassare poll found that local residents were less willing than the country as_a_whole to agree that every citizen should be guaranteed enough to eat and a place to sleep . Will the country also move eventually toward the Orange County position ? Those questions aren ' t answerable now , but some clues could be just around the corner . With the shifting of the 1996 California presidential primary from June to March , the state and county will be much more important to Republican presidential candidates . The parade of elephants will begin in_earnest in 1995 , probably earlier than you ' d like , but it ' ll be interesting to see how GOP contenders position themselves on the moderate-to-conservative scale . As recently as a_few years ago , their tack would have been obvious : Take as conservative a position as possible and watch Orange County votes pour in . That may still hold but a cautionary note for the Republican candidates : Yes , the country may be moving toward Orange County conservatism , but local polls also show a majority of Orange County Republicans consistently favoring abortion rights . Perhaps more significant , another Baldassare poll released this week indicates that two of three Orange County residents favor stronger gun-control laws . Baldassare noted that that level of support exceeds what national polls have shown . No longer either a joke or a punch_line , Orange County looks more and more like the straight_man . Good grief ! Orange County a bellwether for the nation ? Hard to imagine and perhaps premature , but it ' ll never again be a ridiculous question .
