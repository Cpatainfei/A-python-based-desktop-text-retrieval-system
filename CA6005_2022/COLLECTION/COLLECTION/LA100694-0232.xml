   <HEADLINE> CITADEL ' S PLAN FOR ASPIRING WOMEN CADETS : GO ELSEWHERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lawyers for The Citadel on Wednesday presented the state-funded all-male military college ' s alternative plan for women hoping to become cadets : Go somewhere else . The plan was a response to a July federal_court order that also called_for the admission of Shannon Faulkner , who has sued to join the school ' s prestigious Cadet Corps.Her hopes to become The Citadel ' s first female cadet were put_on hold , however , until the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond , Va. , can hear the case . Under the alternative plan , called the South Carolina Women ' s Leadership Institute Program , The Citadel would pay_for women seeking a single-gender military education to attend either of two schools in the state -- Columbia or Converse . The two are private colleges and the women would have to join the ROTC program at the University of South Carolina in Wofford . Plans are also expected to be provided_for those who want military_training on a coeducational campus . The alternative plan has to be approved by the federal_court . Aiming to hold_on to its 152-year-old tradition , The Citadel has vigorously fought co-education for more_than a year . Its all-male status was threatened when Faulkner , who had her sex deleted from her high_school transcript , sued the school for rescinding her offer of admission upon learning that she was a woman . Instead of becoming a cadet , she became the first woman to take &quot; day &quot; classes at The Citadel . Day students are civilians and cannot participate in any cadet activities such_as eating_in mess_halls , sleeping_in the barracks and playing in the school band .</TEXT>
