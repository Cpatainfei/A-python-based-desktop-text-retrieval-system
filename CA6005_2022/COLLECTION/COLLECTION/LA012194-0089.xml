   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; MANY FIND COMFORT AND HELP ON-LINE ; AFTERMATH : FOR SOME , COMPUTER SERVICES HAVE BEEN AN ESSENTIAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION . FORAYS INTO CYBERSPACE PROVIDE SOLACE AND EVEN ELICIT ASSISTANCE IN TRACKING_DOWN RELATIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the grim aftermath of the earthquake , computer-linked bulletin_boards hummed furiously as people searched for lost relatives ( &quot; can ' t reach Mom and Dad -- Please help ! ! &quot; ) or just solace ( &quot; Does anybody there feel as frightened as me ? &quot; ) Using their home computers , many of those who still had electric_power sought ways to negotiate quake-damaged roads . ( &quot; Need suggestions for the best way to get from Santa Monica to L.A. County Hospital. &quot; ) They swapped pet stories . ( &quot; The night before the earthquake my cat began to tear around the house in a mad frenzy. &quot; ) And they shared feelings of isolation . ( &quot; This is the only link I have to civilization right now. &quot; ) As soon as the ground stopped shaking , residents began sending electronic notes , trying to determine the hardest-hit areas . Later , people who live outside Southern California sent desperate pleas for help in contacting relatives . As the week progressed , bulletin-board users continued to flood the system with messages . The electronic_communication still has not abated . Many now inquire about the best shortcuts through the San Fernando Valley . Others sign_on following aftershocks and guess the magnitude . And some just while_away the tense hours at_home until a repairman from the building_department or gas_company arrives . Computer services provided assistance during the Malibu fire and other recent disasters . But the electronic response to the Northridge earthquake , computer_experts say , was unprecedented for its speed , scope and sustained interest . * After freeways buckled , buildings collapsed and phones were cut_off , personal_computers linked to on-line message centers often were the only means of obtaining critical information . Prodigy and CompuServe , the nation ' s largest computer-linked systems , set_up earthquake bulletin_boards and immediately were deluged with messages . Prodigy ' s users logged_on more_than 800 # 000 times during the 24 hours after the quake . By now , many Los Angeles residents have grown weary of swapping earthquake yarns . But not the techno-junkies . All week , the earthquake has been the No . 1 topic of discussion . Several dozen people who signed_on to America Online recently engaged in an electronic discussion group : &quot; Did you just feel an aftershock ? &quot; &quot; Just felt it. &quot; &quot; Aftershocks are the worst . Even trucks on the street make my nerves rattle. &quot; &quot; You know it ' s a good one when the car alarms go_off ! &quot; &quot; I ' m starting to feel depressed . My own emotional aftershock . Anybody else ? &quot; &quot; Take_care of yourself . The emotional stuff is treacherous. &quot; &quot; How is the 405 ? &quot; &quot; Slow on the northbound side approaching the Devonshire closure. &quot; &quot; Clear through the Sepulveda Pass. &quot; &quot; I live_in Santa Cruz and went_through this in ' 89 . I feel_for you guys. &quot; &quot; I ' m in San Jose . This brings_back lots of memories . . . . Hang_in there ! &quot; * When Gary Bogumil awoke in Atlanta Monday morning and learned about the severity of the earthquake , he immediately tried to contact a close friend , Richard Mann , who had recently moved to the West San Fernando Valley . He tried Mann ' s home telephone . He tried Mann ' s work phone . He tried his fax machine . He tried his beeper . He tried his cellular_phone . With each call that would not go_through , he grew more concerned . He talked to Mann ' s mother in Atlanta , who was frantic . Finally , Bogumil recalled that a friend had access to the Prodigy bulletin_board . They sent_out this message , and Mann ' s name and phone_number : &quot; Have friend in West Hills . Have not heard a word from him . . . . Mother would like to know if OK . Help ! &quot; While long-distance phone_calls into the area were blocked , a neighbor of Mann who saw the message was able to reach him . She messaged back on the bulletin_board that Mann had &quot; lost some china and crystal , but he is OK. &quot; &quot; We were all so worried , &quot; said Bogumil , &quot; because all we could see on TV were burning buildings , flooding and injured people . We didn ' t know if he was hurt , if he was homeless . . . . We didn ' t know anything . And the not knowing is what ' s so worrisome. &quot; Many of those who share their fears and their secrets over the computer know little about the people who respond to them . Scattered throughout the country , they are connected only by the need to talk -- electronically . They hunker_down over their computer_screens and study the disembodied messages from people known only by handles such_as &quot; I Play Chess &quot; and &quot; Tea Pot Dome. &quot; All day and night Monday and Tuesday frantic people around the country sent messages asking_for help in locating family members . And all day and night , good_Samaritans who live near the quake area signed_on to the earthquake bulletin_boards and went_to work . &quot; I ' m looking_for a person by the name of Danie . . . . I ' m very worried about her , &quot; one man inquired Monday afternoon via Prodigy . &quot; I can ' t call. &quot; Eight minutes later this message , from some unidentified corner of cyberspace , flashed : &quot; I called Danie for you . She answered the phone . She says thanks for being concerned . She is fine. &quot; &quot; Anyone out here who is willing to check on my aunt , who lives_in Northridge and is 80 years old and has heart trouble ? &quot; inquired one woman from Whittier on Wednesday afternoon . &quot; Please contact me. &quot; One minute later a woman messaged the niece : &quot; She has a lot of damage to her home and furnishings . But she is fine. &quot; * The bulletin_boards have proven to be sturdy electronic communicators . While long-distance phone_lines were tied_up in the aftermath of the quake , the bulletin_boards -- connected by private_lines leased by the computer_networks -- stayed open . Prodigy , which has 2 million subscribers in the United States , offered free use of the earthquake message board for the week . The state Office of Emergency Services used Internet , a huge network of computer_systems , to distribute information about power outages , fires , road closures and fatalities . Internet was developed by the Department_of_Defense during the 1970s , state officials say , and an earthquake will not interrupt its service . The system was designed to withstand a nuclear attack . While many logged_on to computer_networks to get earthquake information , a number of people , afraid to leave their damaged houses , just wanted some human contact -- even if it was only through a computer_screen . Headings people listed above their messages included : &quot; A Sleepless Night , &quot; &quot; Abandon California &quot; and &quot; Help Me ! ! ! &quot; The latter wrote : &quot; All my uncle ' s collectibles broke . He ' s been crying all day. &quot; Within a_few hours she had received 29 replies ranging from cheery words of encouragement to religious proselytizing . One person compiled a list of earthquake jokes ( &quot; What did one earthquake say to the other ? It ' s not my fault. &quot; ) and another placed the heading &quot; Sex &quot; above his earthquake musings . For others , the earthquake sparked philosophical debates and precipitated epiphanies . &quot; I am from Ohio and I would like to say that after seeing all_the trouble in California , I have re-evaluated what is important to me , &quot; one man messaged . &quot; You can say that again , &quot; a woman responded . &quot; My husband and I have been working hard to . . . ' compete ' with other members of our family . But after all_of this I think we will just be happy for what we have and the love we can share with our families. &quot; Electronic Dialogue Right after the quake , residents sent notes by computer trying to find_out where the hardest-hit areas were . Later , relatives outside Southern California sent desperate pleas for help in contacting relatives . Even after phone_service and power were restored , quake-related messages continued to flood the system . TUESDAY * &quot; If anyone in the quake area needs to get a message to friends or relatives in Germany , please E-mail and I will pass along . I was from Arleta in the Valley ; I feel with you . I still remember the 1971 earthquake. &quot; * &quot; Anyone out there who is willing to check on someone , my aunt lives in Northridge and is 80 years old with heart trouble ; please contact me . . . . Just mention Julieann to her . Thanks ! &quot; WEDNESDAY * &quot; Well , I ' m going_to attempt it , tomorrow , so what I ' d like to know is : -- Is the 101 the only ( best ) route in from the north ? -- Is the traffic terrible ? Should I travel at night ? Feel free to E-mail me or post. &quot;</TEXT>
