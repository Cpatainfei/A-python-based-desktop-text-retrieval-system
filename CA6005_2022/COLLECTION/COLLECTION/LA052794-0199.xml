   <HEADLINE> LECTURE BECOMES LESSON ON HURDLES TO OVERCOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A lecture at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church on Thursday was aimed at showing that Jews and blacks have in common a shared heritage of persecution : scholars presented newly uncovered evidence that it was during the German colonization of Africa that Nazis developed some of the racist ideology they later applied to Jews . The scholars detailed for the mixed audience how the Nazis tortured and murdered African American prisoners_of_war because of their race , and how they sterilized young children of mixed African and German blood to maintain what they claimed was &quot; racial purity. &quot; Then the floor was opened_to questions , and a 16-year-old African American girl clutching a notebook asked : &quot; Why is there so_much tension between blacks and Jews ? &quot; After a painful silence , a white-haired African American woman told the girl she would get no answers at the forum because the Jews present were the source of the problem . She told the girl she should study the writings of Louis Farrakhan and Khallid Abdul Muhammad to get the real answers . A Jewish member of the audience responded by criticizing Farrakhan for allegedly associating with white racists and having a &quot; divide and conquer &quot; strategy . Then , another member of the audience said the content of the lecture showed a reason for Jews and blacks to come_together : &quot; We survivors are like a family -- if we can demonstrate we suffered the same genocide , that should make us brothers ! &quot; The moderator of the event , organized by the Martyrs Memorial and Museum of the Holocaust , tried to steer questions back to the official topic : how the newly uncovered history of black victimization by the Nazis might be introduced in secondary_school classrooms . But he could not stop the subsequent free-for-all , as the Farrakhan believers and Jewish audience members followed the girl outside and alternately tugged at her arm , with many saying , &quot; Don ' t listen to them ! &quot; Surrounded by her shouting elders , the girl had tears in her eyes but maintained her composure and continued to try to find an answer . &quot; I heard , &quot; she said , &quot; that blacks and Jews once worked together in the civil_rights movement . What happened ? &quot; Finally , the Rev . Leonard Jackson , associate minister of the predominantly black church , took her to a quiet room . He said the answer that he gave her was that blacks and Jews have been divided by people afraid of the power they would have if they were united . &quot; We need to look_at this as a blessing , &quot; Jackson said of the disagreement that erupted . &quot; It should erase the doubt in everyone ' s mind that ( education ) is needed. &quot; Indeed , the lecture had been inspired by another fracas -- the controversy that erupted after some Oakland high_school students were kicked_out of a movie_theater for laughing_at scenes of the murder of Jews in the movie &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Alex Grobman , director of the Holocaust museum , who moderated Thursday ' s event , said that the Oakland students reacted that way because they were unfamiliar_with history and did not understand that the events in the film really happened . He invited several of the students to visit the museum , and found that they were genuinely interested in understanding what had happened under the Nazis . Sam Goetz , chairman of the museum and a survivor of the camp featured in the film , said the students became &quot; very emotional &quot; as they heard his story firsthand . Grobman and Goetz concluded that they had to find a way to teach the Holocaust that makes_sense to diverse students . They looked_for Holocaust stories that involved blacks , and discovered the work of Howard University-trained academics Susanne Riveles and Robert Kesting , who were the featured speakers Thursday . Kesting , an archivist at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , said that in one case , 11 captured African American soldiers were humiliated by Nazi SS officers and forced to carry them on their backs before they were tortured , mutilated and executed . Other black soldiers were forced to dig their own graves before they were executed . Although white soldiers were also mistreated by Germans , Kesting says blacks tended to be treated worse because of their race . In a horrific example of Nazi eugenics -- the pseudo-science of genetically &quot; improving &quot; the human_race -- hundreds of half-black , half-German children , ages 6 to 12 , were sterilized under government dictates in the 1930s , Kesting said . Some may have been killed in Nazi &quot; euthanasia &quot; programs , he said . Labeled the &quot; Rhineland bastards , &quot; the children were for the most part the offspring of German women who married African soldiers who were part of the_French army occupying western Germany after World_War I . Riveles detailed how the racist attitudes of some Nazi officials were shaped by their experiences in German colonies in Africa , where they began to consider some races subhuman . The stories of the shared history of suffering under the Nazis were deeply moving , said several members of the audience , which was largely made_up of schoolteachers of various races . But the controversy surrounding the teen-ager ' s question clearly shook_up many people . Cookie Lommel , founder of a group called Operation Unity , which is aimed at improving black-Jewish relations , compared the tension between the African Americans and Jews to &quot; sibling rivalry -- you do so many things together but you also fight. &quot; She shook her head at the fracas caused by the girl ' s innocent question . &quot; It shows what a hot button it is , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
