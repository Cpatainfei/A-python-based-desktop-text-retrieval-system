   <HEADLINE> QUESTIONERS PUT HEAT TO CLINTON ON WHITEWATER ; TOWN_MEETING : IN A FORUM WHERE HE USUALLY EXCELS , PRESIDENT IS TAKEN ABACK BY CHALLENGES TO HIS TRUSTWORTHINESS . HE TESTILY DEFENDS HIMSELF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , responding in a televised town_meeting to a woman who said that the Whitewater controversy has sapped the nation ' s trust in him , insisted that he and the First_Lady had done nothing wrong and asked that he be allowed to do his job without distracting questions . The President was clearly taken_aback by the challenge from a woman in the live audience here , who not only asked him how he could win_back the nation ' s trust but wondered aloud whether he and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are middle-class Americans or just another pair of &quot; villainous , money-grubbing Republicans. &quot; Clinton said he is from a middle-class background and had never skirted the law in his investments or taxes . He heatedly declared that no one has credibly accused him of abuse of power in office &quot; and never will. &quot; The town_hall meeting , a format that Clinton usually dominates , was unusually tough for the President . Participants from Charlotte ; Austin , Tex. ; Bristol , Tenn. , and Roanoke , Va. , challenged Clinton with their questions . A man from Austin asked whether Clinton could be trusted after numerous flip-flops on policy and the continuing stream of revelations about the Clintons ' role in Whitewater Development Corp. , a failed Ozark real_estate firm . The Clintons ' partner in Whitewater owned a savings and loan that failed , costing taxpayers at least $ 47 million . The President , angrily jabbing his finger at the man ' s image on a television monitor , said that he had been falsely accused of wrongdoing . &quot; I have been the subject , sir , of false charges , &quot; the President said testily , without specifying who had made the allegations . The charges &quot; make their credibility an issue , not mine , &quot; he said . He then said : &quot; You all are free to disagree_with me but disagreement is different from trust . Let ' s not mix apples and oranges. &quot; Responding to the question about Mrs . Clinton ' s investments , Clinton said that his wife did not receive preferential treatment in trading in cattle futures in the late 1970s that made her nearly $ 100 # 000 . He said that she &quot; got cold feet &quot; and withdrew from the cattle futures market just weeks before a major crash that wiped_out scores of investors . Clinton said that his wife got_out of the risky commodities market after receiving a margin_call on her trading account shortly before their daughter , Chelsea , was born . Documents released by the White_House show that Mrs . Clinton cashed out her commodities account seven months before Chelsea was born and did not resume substantial trading thereafter . The documents do not indicate that she was ever subject_to a margin_call , in which a brokerage_house demands that an investor put_up more money to cover potential trading losses .</TEXT>
