   <HEADLINE> RIVALS WAGE FIERCE FIGHT FOR BASE HELD BY SOUTH IN YEMEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fierce artillery , tank and rocket battles raged Wednesday around a key military base here that is the last major obstacle in the north ' s advance toward the southern stronghold of Aden . Fighting around the Al Anad base , 35 miles northwest of Aden , has gone_on for days in what could be the decisive battle of Yemen ' s two-week civil_war . The prize in the seesaw battle is control of the country ' s main north-south road and the gateway to Aden , on the tip of the Arabian_Peninsula . The fighting broke_out May 5 after months of small-scale skirmishes between the rival leaderships of the former North and South Yemen , which merged in 1990 . Northern-controlled Sana radio appealed Wednesday to the estimated 250 # 000 people living_in Aden to declare their loyalty to the north under President Ali Abdullah Saleh . &quot; This is the last chance for those who are misled by the forces of apostasy and secession to join the ranks of their brothers , &quot; the broadcast said . The southern command said its forces had crushed an attempt to capture Al Anad and routed a northern brigade 30 miles east of Aden . It said 400 northern soldiers were killed but did not mention its own casualties . Northern forces said they had captured Al Anad on Monday , but their commanders told reporters Wednesday that a sprawling air_base south of the main Al Anad complex was still in southern hands .</TEXT>
