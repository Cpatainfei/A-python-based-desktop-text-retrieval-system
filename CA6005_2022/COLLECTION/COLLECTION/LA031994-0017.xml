   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MEXICO POISED FOR POLITICAL REFORM ; ELECTIONS : SPECIAL_SESSION OF CONGRESS EXPECTED TO PASS MEASURES TO HELP PREVENT BALLOT STUFFING AND TO STIFFEN PENALTIES FOR FRAUD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Growing pressure from its citizens , epitomized by a Jan . 1 Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas , is forcing Mexico ' s government to match the strides made toward opening the economy with similar advances in the notoriously closed political_system . A special_session of the Mexican Congress has been called_for next week to consider far-reaching political reforms that include turning_over control of the institute that runs elections to citizen groups and toughening legislation to punish electoral fraud . The reforms are assured of passage in a legislature controlled by the highly disciplined Institutional Revolutionary Party , which has ruled Mexico for 65 years . But more important is the assurance that the measures will be implemented by Interior_Secretary Jorge Carpizo MacGregor , whose integrity is widely regarded . The package heading toward Congress is the third in the five years of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s administration ; by far , these measures are the most profound . They include provisions for revising and correcting voter registration lists and voting forms that will help prevent ballot stuffing . Despite earlier indications from unnamed government officials , they stop short of giving international observers a formal role . They do , however , contemplate that &quot; foreign visitors &quot; will call_on polling_places on Election_Day . Mexicans have viewed their election process with skepticism for decades , widely suspecting the PRI , as the ruling party is known , of alchemy : magically transforming votes for the opposition into votes for the PRI . In the 1988 presidential election , the computer tallying system mysteriously crashed , leading many Mexicans to suspect that Salinas did not receive a majority . Throughout Salinas ' term , the administration has resisted significant political changes , even as it implemented wide-ranging free-market economic reforms . Numerous state elections have been so marred by fraud and citizen marches on the Zocalo -- Mexico_City ' s main plaza and the site of frequent political demonstrations -- that the administration has been forced to install interim governors and call new elections . But what forced the government to propose the latest round of political reforms was an uprising in Chiapas that left at least 145 people dead , political analyst Jorge Castaneda said . &quot; They thought that if there were charges of fraud , it would be just the same old guys in the Zocalo . But now , it ' s guys with guns , &quot; he said . The rebel demands include guarantees of clean elections or the resignation of Salinas . The government has refused to negotiate national political issues with the guerrillas , who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army . The proposed reforms , however , clearly address many of the guerrillas ' concerns . Rebel spokesman Subcommander Marcos said earlier this week that the Zapatistas will end the current cease-fire unless they see substantial signs of a move toward greater democracy . &quot; There is an overall fear of major turmoil after the ( presidential ) election &quot; on Aug . 21 , Castaneda said . &quot; They are scared that the whole place will go haywire if any candidate contests the results. &quot; Those fears have been fed by the kidnaping this week of Alfredo Harp Helu , chairman of Mexico ' s largest financial group , he said . While the kidnaping -- which sent the national stock_market plunging -- is apparently unrelated to the Chiapas uprising , it provides an additional indication of instability , Castaneda said . One of Mexico ' s key attractions for foreign investors traditionally has been its stability . The proposed reforms are the result of negotiations among the country ' s nine registered political_parties and Carpizo . While they represent the most substantive changes in decades , the reforms stopped far short of proposals to : * Allow Mexicans living abroad to vote . * Revive coalitions among different parties , a tactic that opposition presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas used to build a coalition in 1988 .</TEXT>
