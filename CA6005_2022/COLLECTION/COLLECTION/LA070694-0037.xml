   <HEADLINE> OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ; AT 16 , VARGAS PROVES AGE DOESN ' T MATTER IN RING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only 16 , Fernando Vargas has learned that patience pays_off . On Tuesday , it earned him a gold medal . Vargas , from Oxnard , defeated Datris Biagas , 29-15 , to win the lightweight title at the Olympic Festival . There will be a lot more medals for Vargas but probably not at future festivals . Vargas is the youngest boxer at the Festival , and if not for his youth , he would n ' t be here at all . Already the U.S. lightweight champion , he was too young to participate in the competition to determine who would fight in the Goodwill Games or World Boxing Cup . International rules do not allow boxers under the age of 17 to compete in an international event . As the lightweight champion , there is little doubt Vargas would be_on the U.S. boxing team headed for the Goodwill Games in St . Petersburg , Russia , if he were a year older . His cruise through the Festival bouts supports the idea . Vargas has never lost at a U.S. Boxing-governed fight . &quot; You ' re going to learn something every time you ' re out there , so I don ' t mind at all , &quot; Vargas said . &quot; My ultimate goal is to win the gold in the Olympics . This is a pretty good stepping_stone . I have one gold , now I want another . &quot; A rule is a rule -- it will come , so I just have to be patient. &quot; He was Tuesday . &quot; I knew he would like to come_in on me and box , so I thought I could get him to commit , &quot; Biagas said . &quot; But he was more patient than I thought he would be . He ' s a real good boxer. &quot; that ' s classy praise from a man nine years older than Vargas and a winner of three consecutive Armed Forces titles . Biagas aggravated a detached-nerve injury in his right elbow in the first of the three rounds after missing with a right cross . It limited his effectiveness considerably as he jabbed with his left and he clenched many times to try to land short hits with his right . &quot; Hey , I ' ve won with the jab before , he was just too good , &quot; said Biagas . Biagas sported a raspberry-colored bruise under his left eye . &quot; It doesn ' t matter how old he is. &quot; So don ' t be surprised if Biagas , in his second consecutive Festival , starts a petition to reduce the international age requirement . Vargas can get international experience later this month and next at the Elite Junior Olympic Program in Colorado Springs , or at Junior Olympic Dual matches against Ireland and Canada . &quot; I want to enter because I want international experience , &quot; Vargas said . &quot; I want to win a gold at the Olympics , I want to be famous , and I want to be_on TV and have everyone say ' I know that guy. ' &quot; He even says he wants to look good winning . Those are not so small goals for a fighter whose trainer didn ' t think he would pan_out as a boxer . &quot; He thought I had fear in me or that I would take one punch and go_down , &quot; Vargas said . &quot; Luckily , I ' m not like that. &quot; A quick fighter , Vargas hasn ' t taken many punches . Olympic Festival Notes In the super-heavyweight division , Lamont Brewster of Los Angeles won the gold over Juan Cruz . . . . . Marion Jones of Thousand Oaks scored 17 points to lead the South women ' s basketball_team to a 94-92 victory in the gold medal game . . . . . Joy Burkholder of Mission Viejo won the silver in women ' s platform diving with a score of 399.45. Patty Armstrong of Woodlands , Tex. , won the gold ( 427.45 ) . . . . . In tennis , Amanda Augustus of Palos Verdes teamed with Katy Propstra of Arizona to win the women ' s doubles_gold medal for the West . Jakub Pietrowski of Huntington Beach teamed with Elliot Weiss of Dallas to win the men ' s doubles title .</TEXT>
