   <HEADLINE> THE MELDING AMERICAS ; ECONOMY ; BUSINESS BREAKS THROUGH OLD BARRIERS OF FEAR ; LATIN GOVERNMENTS IN PAST HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT , U.S. FIRMS WARY OF CORRUPTION . BUT TIMES ARE CHANGING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not long ago , business was among the most divisive issues in U.S. relations with Latin_America . Latin governments looked suspiciously on foreign investment as a menace to be regulated ; U.S. companies were just as wary of expropriation-prone politicians who might confiscate their oil_wells , plantations or mines overnight . But nowadays , doing business is a driving force in bringing the Americas closer . Governments are even beginning to look_upon foreign businesses as allies that can help them solve perennial problems . For example , the Brazilian government is paying Raytheon $ 1 billion for a radar surveillance service to help stop poaching and monitor drug trafficking in the Amazon rain_forest . Across Latin_America , U.S. corporations are tackling one of the region ' s most persistent irritations -- lousy phone_service . The Americans are the new owners of the notoriously unpopular national telephone_companies , purchased from governments eager to unload the problem . The most obvious political evidence of closer relationships in the hemisphere is the abundance of new trade alliances , starting with the 10-month-old North_American Free_Trade Agreement and extending_to South_America ' s Mercosur , a combine of Brazil , Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay . The big alliances complement a growing number of bilateral deals . Even outside these agreements , import tariffs are tumbling . Mexico ' s average tariff fell from 27 % a decade ago to 13 % last year . Chile ' s average has been 11 % for the last five years . Once highly protectionist , Brazil has slashed tariffs from an average of 51 % in 1986 to 14.2 % this year . This month , the Brazilian government cut tariffs on 13 # 000 items . Imported autos , televisions , microwave_ovens , stereos and video cassettes will all be cheaper as tariffs fall from 35 % and 30 % to 20 % . Lower tariffs should mean more robust trade . As Mexican tariffs fell_over the last five years , two-way trade with the United States has doubled . Overall , American trade with Latin nations reached $ 141.5 billion last year , a 45 % increase over 1989 . Investment has followed commerce , with U.S. money pouring into Latin_American stock_markets , industrial_parks and natural-resource companies . Already among the largest investors in the region , American auto_makers have stepped_up their activities . General Motors is pumping $ 90 million into a new pickup_truck factory in Cordoba , Argentina , and building another factory in Silao , Mexico . U.S. corporations are important investors in Chilean and Peruvian copper_mines . Between them , Exxon Overseas Investment Corp . and Phelps Dodge have sunk nearly $ 2 billion into Chilean mining and have authorizations to invest $ 1.5 billion more . In Peru , William Massey , president of the American Chamber_of_Commerce there as well as the country ' s Goodyear subsidiary , noted : &quot; I ' d say that Peru is No . 1 on the list in Latin_America . . . . People are amazed at how easy it is to invest . The proof is the number of new mining_companies that have been formed. &quot; Those include Newmont Mining Corp . and Cyprus Minerals , in addition to two oil_companies , Advantage Resources International Co . and American International Petroleum Corp . Peru . All are U.S.-owned. Cyprus Minerals started off paying the government $ 37 million for the Cerro Verde copper_mine , planning to invest $ 485 million more . Southern Peru Copper Corp . paid $ 65 million for a formerly government-owned copper refinery and plans to invest $ 445 million over the next five years . Thus the government decision to sell_off companies has fostered the growth of foreign investment in Peruvian mining -- as it has in many other sectors of Latin_American industry . In Argentina , U.S. investors put $ 1.5 billion -- 27 % of the total -- into privatization from 1990 to May , 1994 . GTE Corp . and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph became part of the management team at the Venezuelan telephone_company , Cantv , when the government sold controlling interest in the company in 1990 . Besides selling_off their own companies , governments have encouraged foreign capital by lifting restrictions on the industries in which foreigners may invest . Late last year , Mexico replaced its 20-year-old &quot; Law to Regulate Foreign Investment and Encourage Domestic Investment &quot; with a more neutrally titled &quot; Foreign Investment Law. &quot; The liberalized law permits broader foreign ownership of mines , airlines , airports , ports , farmland , courier services and cross-border freight . Two dozen applicants are now eagerly waiting to hear which will be the first foreign financial_institutions licensed to open banks in Mexico in almost six decades . Other countries in the region have opened_up their oil_industries . Esso Argentina , an Exxon subsidiary , plans to invest $ 80 million to $ 90 million over the next decade . Mobil Oil Corp . is exploring Peru ' s Madre de Dios basin in southeastern Peru . Even government contracts are opening_up . Hughes Aircraft , bidding against a French company , recently won a contract to provide launching services for a Brazilian satellite . Before 1992 , only Brazilian companies were allowed to provide such services . Importantly , there has also been a change in attitude about what has been the most important unwritten restriction on U.S. business in Latin_America : corruption . In a sign that the days of impunity are over , both Venezuela and Brazil have jailed sitting presidents on corruption charges . In Chile , bribes and kickbacks are not acceptable , foreign businessmen say . &quot; If you are dealing with public officials , you ' ll get_into trouble , and if you are dealing with private officials , it will cause offense , &quot; said J . Michael Combes of the U.S.-owned Marco Chilean shipbuilding company in Chile . Investment , meanwhile , is not all flowing one way . Mexico ' s Vitro Corp . paid $ 800 million for money-losing Anchor Glass Container Corp . in 1989 , turning the company around in less than a year . Cementos Mexicanos , or Cemex , has become North_America ' s largest cement maker , partly by buying_up its U.S. competitors . Cemex launched its aggressive acquisition campaign as a defensive_measure when European companies tried to enter the Mexican market . Ironically , those same non-American companies have used U.S. anti-dumping laws to prevent Cemex from operating its North_American holdings as a single cross-border unit . And investment from the north is creating trade flows_from the south . Ford Motor Co . plans to start exporting from its old Cuautitlan plant in central Mexico this week . The company already makes Mercury Tracers for the world market in Hermosillo and engines in Chihuahua for export to the United States . Contributing to this article were Adriana von Hagen in Peru and Times staff writer Ron Harris in Brazil . Closer Ties U.S. investment in Latin_America has increased steadily in recent years , rising even as capital from other countries fell , as it did_in Brazil two years ago . Following are statistics on accumulated U.S. investment in selected countries , in millions of dollars : 06 # 09 , 08 # 08 , 08 # 08 , 08 Country 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 Mexico * 16 # 771 19 # 080 21 # 466 23 # 118 26 # 621 Brazil 10 # 224 10 # 488 10 # 959 11 # 277 12 # 400 Chile * * 2 # 130 2 # 401 2 # 751 3 # 044 3 # 681 Peru 592 592 591 603 626 * Excludes stock_market investment . * * U.S. investment in Chile accumulated since 1974 . Most foreign companies had left Chile in 1973 . Following are statistics on accumulated U.S. investment as a percentage of total accumulated foreign investment : 06 # 09 , 06 # 06 , 06 # 06 , 06 Country 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 Mexico 63 % 63 % 63 % 62 % 63 % Brazil 30 % 28 % 28 % 30 % 30 % Chile * 43 % 21 % 36 % 30 % 38 % Peru 46 % 46 % 45 % 40 % 39 % * New investment ; running figures on U.S. accumulated investment not available . However , U.S. accumulated investment in Chile was 49 % of total accumulated foreign investment in 1989 , but had shrunk to 39 % of the total by June , 1994 , as other countries increased investments there .
