   <HEADLINE> A QUESTION OF THE RIGHT TO DIE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The right to die has long been discussed by those stricken by cancer or other terminal illnesses , but it is the AIDS community -- particularly its gay contingent -- that has been the most organized and supportive , watchers say . &quot; This group is light-years ahead of any other group in terms of empowering themselves , &quot; says John Pridonoff , executive_director of the Hemlock Society U.S.A. , a euthanasia advocacy group . &quot; The educational level and history of activism in the tightly_knit gay community has led to a very assertive movement. &quot; Gay_men with AIDS have a harder_time staying in denial than other patients do , he says . &quot; While cancer strikes individual families , AIDS has gutted an entire society , &quot; he says . &quot; Cancer patients haven ' t watched 30 friends die gruesome deaths with no time to grieve in between . They ' re demanding more of everything -- medically , spiritually , socially and politically -- because they realize there ' s nothing left to lose. &quot; The suicides go_on mostly in large cities , Pridonoff says , because that ' s where most of the resources and support for it are . &quot; The fact that it ' s against the law doesn ' t mean anything to people dying , &quot; he says . &quot; And those assisting are so proficient at it now that the coroner ' s office doesn ' t even get , or want to get , involved . As long as it ' s not a blatant suicide , they let_it_go by. &quot; Stephen Jamison , formerly a Hemlock regional director who now runs life and death workshops in San Francisco , estimates that one in four AIDS deaths are assisted suicides . He says many are &quot; managed deaths &quot; brought_about by doctors giving deliberate morphine overdoses , ostensibly for the control of pain . &quot; It ' s out there and it ' s epidemic but no one wants to face what ' s going_on , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m not a hard-core advocate of the right to die . But I do want to help them make the best decision. &quot; Jamison says the most important part of the right-to-die movement needs to be cautious education . &quot; People are involving family and friends and they ' re way over their heads , &quot; he says . &quot; I want to see physicians and therapists involved . Instead of keeping it closeted , let ' s move it out and say , how do we involve families , significant others , friends , nurses and hospices in the process of helping patients make the right decision ? &quot; LESLIE KNOWLTON</TEXT>
