   <HEADLINE> TOKYO STOCKS FALL SLIGHTLY IN LIGHT TRADING ; MARKETS : DROP IS SEEN AS A MILD REACTION TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE YEN , NORTH_KOREA ' S FUTURE AND LACKLUSTER G-7 RESULTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks declined in early trading here today on worries about the yen ' s strength against the dollar , the death of North_Korean President Kim Il Sung and lackluster results from the Naples , Italy , summit of industrialized nations . Kim ' s death , announced Saturday , and the Group of Seven summit , which ended Sunday , &quot; both were negative &quot; for Tokyo markets &quot; but not tremendously , &quot; said Keith Donaldson , equity strategist at Salomon Bros . Asia . &quot; The real crux_of_the_matter still is the yen &quot; and whether it will continue to gain in value against the U.S. dollar , he said . The 225-stock Nikkei index fell 67.12 points , or 0.3 % , to close the morning today at 20 # 459.39 in light trading . &quot; The market is likely to stay cautious as players try to gauge the effects of a leadership change in North_Korea , &quot; said Shigeyoshi Fujita , general_manager at Cosmo Securities . The dollar , meanwhile , was trading at midmorning today at 98.32 yen , down 0.21 yen from Friday ' s Tokyo close but up 0.22 yen from Friday ' s close_in New York . At one point earlier today , the dollar hit a new worldwide low of 97.60 yen in Sydney , Australia . It also dipped to 97.90 yen in the Tokyo market this morning before recovering some ground on the strength of intervention by the Bank_of_Japan in support of the yen . The dollar closed morning trading at 98.37 yen , down 0.16 yen from Friday ' s Tokyo close but up 0.27 yen from Friday ' s close_in New York . The death of Kim &quot; raises the specter of some political instability for the region , &quot; Donaldson said , &quot; but I don ' t think people are overly concerned. &quot; The impact on the Tokyo stock_market is also limited , he said , by the tendency of investors to treat the dollar as a &quot; safe haven &quot; during times of international instability . &quot; As long as there ' s no more negative news from Korea , the ( value of the ) yen is more likely to have an impact on the ( stock ) market than North_Korea , &quot; he said . Kim ' s death may be seen as a negative factor for the Tokyo stock_market because it ends hopes for an early summit_meeting between the presidents of North_Korea and South_Korea , and could delay other efforts to ease tensions over Pyongyang ' s nuclear program , said Geoffrey Barker , an analyst at Baring Securities Ltd . But there also is a &quot; compensating factor &quot; in that there may be &quot; a period of introversion in North_Korea , &quot; he said . &quot; I would think that having a fight with the United States or pushing the nuclear issue would go_on the back burner for a while . So I think this is not a key point . We ' re not going_to need to worry about it. &quot; The G-7 summit in Naples was marked by &quot; an immense amount of complacency &quot; by the various leaders , but its limited results produced &quot; very little disappointment in the markets because there was so little expectation , &quot; Barker said . &quot; The Japanese market is off a little , but we ' re not talking_about major disappointment. &quot;</TEXT>
