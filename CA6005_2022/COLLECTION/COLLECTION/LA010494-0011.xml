   <HEADLINE> THE DISTANT HARM OF SALVADORAN SLAUGHTER ; REPRESSION PROMPTS EMIGRATION , AND THAT AFFECTS L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the 1980s , the United States bankrolled a series of civilian and military regimes in El_Salvador against the left-wing insurgency of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) . In the process , Washington often turned_a_blind_eye to government-sponsored violence against Salvadoran civilians . In the last months of 1993 the State_Department released more_than 12 # 000 papers documenting U.S. complicity in some of this violence . The most famous case , dismissed at the time by the U.S. State_Department , was the slaughter in the mountain village of El Mozote of at least 500 and quite possibly as_many as 800 civilians , including at least 143 infants and children . The Dec . 6 issue of The New Yorker contains the fullest account yet of this atrocity , a book-length article by Mark Danner . Danner begins with the work of the_Argentine Forensic Anthropology Unit , which set_out painstakingly to exhume and analyze the victims , skeleton by shattered skeleton . What impresses a Los Angeles reader of this account more_than the sickening details of the slaughter and the cover-up is something that Danner mentions only in passing . The Salvadoran army ' s broad counterinsurgency strategy was that of &quot; denying the fish their water. &quot; Guerrillas , in this metaphor , are fish ; the general population is the water . The terrorization and forced relocation of the population dry_up the water and expose the fish . Danner notes that in the remote border province of Morazan , where El Mozote is situated , this tactic had much of its intended effect . The peasants who were not slain in the army ' s savage &quot; Hammer and Anvil &quot; operation fled into Honduras , where reports confirming the El Mozote massacre , among others , were forwarded by U.S. officials in the area to the State_Department ( which suppressed the reports ) . By now , Danner reports , some of the &quot; water &quot; has flowed back , but much of it has not . Where has it gone ? Try Los Angeles , where some of the poorest , least-prepared Latino immigrants to have arrived in recent years are the Salvadoran victims of a decade of U.S. policy in their war-torn homeland . In the long_run , they surely will enrich the city ; but in the short run , their adjustment has been painful for them and costly for the community that took them in . This is , regrettably , the sort of thing foreign_policy planners rarely think_about . We hope that , for the sake of Los Angeles as well as of El_Salvador , they will think seriously about it in the few months that remain before El_Salvador ' s election . U.N. monitors as well as human_rights groups have reported an upsurge in activity by anti-communist death squads . Since last August , 20 murders have occurred , including those of three FMLN candidates for the National Assembly . In November , the State_Department sent Alexander Watson , assistant secretary_of_state for inter-American affairs , to San Salvador to warn all political sectors against engaging in violence . That is a step_in the right direction , but the Clinton_Administration must_not think that a re-escalation of violence in El_Salvador will be a tragedy for that country alone . If it triggers a new_wave of forced emigration , it could also be a painful and costly development for this city .</TEXT>
