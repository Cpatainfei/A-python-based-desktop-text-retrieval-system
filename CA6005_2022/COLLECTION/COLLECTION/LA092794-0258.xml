   <HEADLINE> NEW PLAN TO LIFT BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO STUDIED ; BALKANS : COMPROMISE BEING WORKED_ON AT U.N. WOULD PERMIT SHIPMENTS TO MUSLIM-LED GOVERNMENT FORCES EARLY IN 1995 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. officials , Bosnian leaders and other allies conferred Monday on a new proposal to break the stalemate over the Bosnia arms embargo and abruptly shift the balance_of_power in the three-year civil_war . Convening at the United Nations for several days of meetings , top officials are debating a compromise to lift the embargo and permit weapons shipments to the Muslim-led Bosnian army -- thus letting it come closer to matching the firepower of its Bosnian Serb adversaries -- but not until early next year . The proposal , first aired by Bosnian officials last month , has apparently softened the opposition of British and French officials who have threatened to pull their troops out of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the arms embargo is lifted . They would withdraw their forces_out of a concern that a resolution allowing arms to Bosnia might provoke an all-out Bosnian Serb offensive that would endanger their troops . The proposed delay would allow the allies to find safer positions for their troops or withdraw them entirely . The delay also may weaken Russian opposition to lifting the embargo . Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said Monday that she believes &quot; that as the situation evolves , they may , in fact , see some value &quot; in such a move . In addition , an agreement would enable the United States to sidestep a fast-approaching Oct . 15 deadline for action on the issue . President Clinton has promised to urge the U.N. Security_Council to end the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs do not agree by that date to a peace plan advanced by the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . The President also has promised to consult Congress on possibly lifting the embargo unilaterally if the Security_Council doesn ' t go_along . So far , the Bosnian Serbs have rejected the peace plan . The Bosnian government has accepted it . Ending the embargo next month poses serious risks . It could escalate the war swiftly , possibly spilling it over into neighboring countries , and it would probably draw the United States into acting_as a military sponsor for the Bosnians . There has been speculation that the Bosnian Muslims fear lifting the ban immediately would lead to the swift evacuation of U.N. troops and an all-out attack by the Serbs on the Muslims . Asked at a news_conference what would induce the Serbs to hold_off such an offensive if the embargo was lifted next year instead , Bosnian Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey said that &quot; we have reasons to expect &quot; that the United Nations now would heed Clinton ' s demand that it call more air strikes against the Serbs and expand the number of zones that exclude Serbian heavy_weapons . Lifting the embargo would also mean that the United States &quot; would have some real responsibility to arm and equip &quot; the Bosnian Muslims , said one U.S. official . The compromise would avoid those difficulties , at least for a time . It also would allow more time for the developing split between the Bosnian Serbs and their allies in Serbia to mature , and it would enable the United States and its allies to look_for other ways to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept the partition formula of the international peace plan . On the other hand , it could also demonstrate to the Serbs that the allies remain reluctant to lift the embargo . The developments came as Clinton delivered an annual U.N. address in which he appealed_to the General_Assembly to end the growing &quot; strangulation &quot; of besieged Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital , and urged the use of NATO warplanes to get the job done . In a speech that resonated with his growing frustration , Clinton warned that after a period of improvement , conditions around Sarajevo have &quot; once again deteriorated substantially. &quot; &quot; A new resolve by the United Nations to enforce its resolutions is now necessary to save Sarajevo , &quot; he said . &quot; NATO stands ready to act. &quot; Clinton also used his speech to explain a foreign_policy that even many allies in the U.N. audience have found erratic . In unusually brief remarks , the President pointed to recent U.S. interventions -- notably Haiti -- to try to calm fears raised in last year ' s speech that the United States was turning decisively away from international involvements . Clinton sought to minimize the differences with his allies in his 25-minute address , as he reviewed U.S. interventions over the past year . He cited Haiti to show that the United States will risk its blood and money when its criteria for peacekeeping missions are met . In a clear appeal for more international support of the U.S. action in Haiti , Clinton said that in the Caribbean nation &quot; the United States has demonstrated that it would lead a multinational force when our interests are plain , when the cause is right , when the mission is achievable and the nations of the world stand with us. &quot; Clinton made no mention of the risks of the intervention . Nor did he comment on the weekend shootout in Cap Haitien that left 10 Haitians dead and brought civil chaos to the northern city . Instead , he pledged confidently that ultimately &quot; essential civil_order will be restored . Human_rights violations will be curbed . . . . The military_leaders will step_down . Democracy will be restored. &quot; Times staff writers Stanley Meisler and Norman Kempster contributed to this report .</TEXT>
