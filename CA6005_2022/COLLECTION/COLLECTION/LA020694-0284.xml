   <HEADLINE> MASTERS OF MULTIMEDIA ; TECHNOLOGY : FOR THE HANDFUL OF O.C. COMPANIES PRODUCING CD-ROM SOFTWARE , THE FUTURE HAS FINALLY ARRIVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chuck Cortright and Angela Aber were pioneers in multimedia before it became a buzzword . &quot; We were the idiots out there babbling about multimedia , &quot; said Aber , co-founder with Cortright of software company the Graphix Zone in Irvine . &quot; People said , ' Multi-what ? ' Now it ' s in the paper every day. &quot; After a long journey , multimedia -- a combination of video , animation , graphics , text and sound in a single computer_program -- has arrived , thanks in large part to the CD-ROM : short for compact_disc , read-only_memory . In a typical computer_store , the snazziest software is now running_on computer and video_game systems that use the CD-ROM , a cousin of the music CD . The dazzling graphics and audio of CD-ROMs are available to anyone with a fairly new home computer and components that can cost less than $ 500 . The discs themselves are sold everywhere from software stores to Wal-Mart for an average price of $ 42 . For the Graphix Zone and a handful of other Orange County software companies producing CD-ROMs , that means a chance to generate not only &quot; oohs &quot; and &quot; aahs &quot; but also dollars and jobs in deals with some of the biggest names in the entertainment_industry . In partnership with media giant Time Warner Inc. , the Graphix Zone is producing an interactive music video featuring rock artist Prince . That program , not yet titled , will let fans listen to the singer in stereo , watch animation and view music videos . To be shipped on June 7 , the star ' s birthday , it is the first in a series of rock_music titles planned by the two companies . The Graphix Zone and other local companies expect the new technology to give their revenue a huge boost . &quot; The CD-ROM is like manna_from_heaven for us , &quot; said Martin Alper , president of video_game publisher Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc. in Irvine . &quot; There is a significant market today , and we expect exponential growth to take_place in this sector. &quot; * Mainstream acceptance of CD-ROM technology didn ' t happen overnight . Graphix Zone co-founders Cortright and Aber have dabbled_in everything from cinematic production to computer training since they started the company in 1989 as a desktop_publishing software reseller . But now that the company has focused_on the development of CD-ROMs , its access to the information superhighway , which promises interactive TV with 500 channels , seems assured . &quot; The next three years will be very lucrative for people creating titles for CD-ROM , &quot; said Tim Bajarin , a computer consultant at Creative Strategies Research International in Santa Clara . &quot; You can see it as a transitionary technology with a very long life. &quot; The CD-ROM , like the music CD , uses a laser to read a pattern of bumps and troughs that are permanently engrained on a five-inch metal platter . Those patterns are basic digital data that can be understood by a computer . On music CDs , only sound is stored in the patterns . But CD-ROMs add pictures , words , video images and animation -- multimedia . Personal_computers equipped with information readers known as CD-ROM_drives can scan the data stored on the discs , which can pack more_than 600 times the amount of information on a typical floppy_disk . For enthusiasts , the difference between floppy_disk video_games and CD-ROMs is as great as that between silent films and modern motion_pictures , said Johnny Wilson , editor of Computer_Gaming World , an Anaheim Hills magazine that reviews computer_games . &quot; It ' s been a long_time coming , but the year of the CD-ROM is here , &quot; he said . &quot; By 1995 , all software games will be_on CD-ROM. &quot; Competing technologies , as well as personal_computer owners ' reluctance to abandon their floppy_disks , kept CD-ROMs from taking_off initially and could still forestall growth . Though the CD-ROM was introduced in 1985 , &quot; the graphics quality . . . has been fairly primitive , &quot; said Raymond Boggs , analyst at market researcher BIS Strategic Decisions in Norwell , Mass . &quot; But now it ' s like watching the first movie when it came_out . People are excited. &quot; * The quality of CD-ROM animation has improved as home computers have gotten more powerful and technologists have learned how to pack more data into a small space . Falling prices have helped too : Typical double-speed drives now cost as low as $ 200 , down from $ 1 # 000 two years ago . The format also got a boost last year when Sega of America Inc. and a small Silicon_Valley start-up firm called 3DO started shipping video_game and entertainment systems that use CD-ROMs . The biggest factor , though , is that close to half of all personal_computers sold in 1994 will feature CD-ROM_drives , said Julie Schwerin , president of InfoTech , a market researcher in Woodstock , Vt . &quot; The CD-ROM industry is doubling every year , while the computer_industry is growing 10 % a year , &quot; she said . &quot; In the 1980s , the manufacturers set these expectations that were too high . Some of the companies that dug_in and waited are doing very well today. &quot; Floppy_disks still dominate software sales . The Software Publishers Assn . estimates that CD-ROMs accounted_for only 2 % of U.S. software revenue last year . But 2.6 million CD-ROM_drives were sold last year , more_than the total for 1986 through 1991 , InfoTech estimates . And 6.6 million home computers now have CD-ROM_drives -- a good chunk of the estimated 40 million PCs in U.S. households . The number of CD-ROM titles has also exploded . There are 7 # 183 in print now , up from 5 # 283 in 1992 and only 94 in 1986 . Together , sales of CD-ROMs and drives are expected to be worth $ 7.7 billion this year -- equal_to the total box_office receipts of all U.S. movie_theaters . Software companies are taking varied approaches to grab a piece of that action . Besides games , companies are putting reference_books , encyclopedias , product catalogues , phone directories and other data on CD-ROMs . Pinnacle Micro in Irvine sells kits that allow companies to create their own master_copies of CD-ROMs . Service_bureaus that also duplicate the discs have sprouted up_to help entrepreneurs who want to create CD-ROMs . Don and Toni Davis , a husband-and-wife team , created a CD-ROM company , CD Book Publishers , in their Fullerton home after Don lost his job in May , 1992 . He publishes the text of federal regulations -- which on paper can be as much as 10 feet thick -- on compact_discs and sells them for $ 75 to $ 200 . Another Fullerton company , Takin ' Care of Business , puts_out a catalogue -- on interactive CD-ROM , of course -- of multimedia products . And Pixis Interactive in Tustin sells an adult CD-ROM title for people who want to play video strip_poker with beautiful models . Irvine-based Rainbow Technologies Inc. has developed a system that allows customers to try_out programs on CD-ROM at_home without setting foot in a store . Purchases can then be made by telephone with a credit_card . Rainbow has licensed the system to Apple Computer Inc. and other large computer makers . Media Resources in Brea has an interactive_multimedia storybook on CD-ROM , &quot; T.J. Finds a Friend , &quot; that shows children how to avoid being kidnaped and how to recognize missing children . It was produced in cooperation with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . * Developing CD-ROM projects is neither simple nor cheap . Text , audio , video and animation must be coordinated seamlessly , and a sophisticated program such_as an elaborate computer_game can take 18 months and more_than $ 1 million to complete . But going_to market with poor-quality programs known as &quot; shovelware &quot; will not generate either big revenue or pacts with high-tech giants , Graphix Zone ' s Cortright said . &quot; We had to be a pioneer to be a player , &quot; he said . &quot; A big reason we got_to work with Time Warner was that they saw the in-house experience and industry contacts that we had. &quot; His company ' s 30 employees labored for six months to produce the Prince CD-ROM , which includes the star ' s latest songs , glittery 3-D animation and video . The company expects to work with other artists on the new genre , which is neither video_game nor music CD . Because the programs are interactive , the user can explore them for hours , jumping back and forth from the videos to animations or just listening to the songs . Such intense projects create positions for graphic_artists , illustrators , programmers , animators , musicians and video experts . But despite openings and an abundance of resumes , Cortright said , hiring goes slowly because &quot; it ' s hard to find experienced people. &quot; Practical knowledge , rather than formal education , usually determines who gets the job . Sean Dunn , 25 , who is integrating the parts of the Prince CD-ROM into a single multimedia presentation , has been at the Graphix Zone since he graduated two years ago from the University of Redlands . He studied multimedia computer skills in his senior year but learned how to put_together projects by doing custom designs for Graphix Zone clients . &quot; They were only beginning to teach this in school when I graduated , &quot; Dunn said . Because the technology is so new , those in the business often learn it by banding_together and sharing their knowledge . Davis of CD Book Publishers leads a group for the North Orange County Computer Club . Its monthly meeting at Chapman University in Orange draws 30 to 50 people who exchange information about the finer points of &quot; romming. &quot; &quot; It ' s a revolution , &quot; Davis said , &quot; and we ' re making it happen. &quot;</TEXT>
