   <HEADLINE> CLINTONS PLAN TV APPEARANCE AS PART OF WHITEWATER STRATEGY ; PUBLICITY : MORE CALL ON FIRST_LADY TO SPEAK OUT ON THE CONTROVERSY . TREASURY_DEPARTMENT TURNS_OVER 3 # 700 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid mounting calls_for First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to speak out on the Whitewater controversy , the White_House planned Friday for both her and President Clinton to appear on at least one prime-time television_news magazine show next week . Hillary Clinton has remained consistently silent on the issue , and White_House aides have been split sharply during the last two days on the wisdom of appearances that would generate new headlines , even if they succeeded in mollifying some critics . &quot; Everybody here has had a slightly different view on it , &quot; one senior official said . Ultimately , however , officials decided that , to be effective , the White_House strategy of openness on the Whitewater matter could not end with the President ' s explanation . Planning for the television appearances was among several developments Friday . The Treasury_Department surrendered 3 # 700 pages of subpoenaed documents describing contacts with the White_House and other federal agencies about its investigation of the failure of a savings and loan connected to the Whitewater real_estate venture . While officials sought to minimize the importance of the records culled from the Treasury_Department files , the sheer volume of them -- more_than three times what the White_House surrendered on Thursday -- appeared to indicate that questionable contacts between regulatory officials and White_House aides occurred over an extended period and involved large_numbers of people . Also on Friday , a GOP lawmaker claimed to have evidence that federal regulators in Washington may have tried to intimidate field investigators looking_into the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan of Little_Rock , Ark . The savings and loan is at the heart of the Whitewater controversy . The thrift was owned by James B . McDougal , who , along with his wife , Susan , was a partner with Bill and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corp. , which was established in the late 1970s to build a resort community in the Ozark Mountains . Federal investigators are trying to determine whether the Clintons received improper loans from McDougal , whose thrift later failed and was taken_over by federal regulators . The primary investigation , being led by special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr. , is also trying to determine the role played by Hillary Clinton , then a partner in the Rose Law_Firm of Little_Rock , in representing Whitewater Development and Madison Guaranty . Fiske ' s team in also looking_into the apparent suicide last July of Deputy White_House Counsel Vincent Foster , who had worked_on the Whitewater matter as a Rose Law_Firm partner and later at the White_House . Hillary Clinton has found herself in an awkward position in the Whitewater matter . Since the beginning of the Administration , she has sought to limit the kind of the publicity she receives -- calling no full-scale Washington press_conferences , for example -- in part to head_off accusations that she is trying to develop an independent political role . But she has played a part in several issues stemming from the Whitewater controversy . It was she who managed the Clinton family finances , including Whitewater transactions , and she was a partner in the Rose Law_Firm . She has also been linked to controversial steps taken by the White_House after Foster ' s apparent suicide . Her chief_of_staff , Margaret Williams , was among top aides who entered Foster ' s office after his body was found in a Virginia park . Questions raised about the removal of Whitewater-related papers from the office led last week to the resignation of White_House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum . Now , even some Democrats are coming_to the view that the First_Lady must more directly address these questions to lay them to rest . She &quot; needs to make herself available for questioning the same way the President did , &quot; Sen . Bob Graham ( D-Fla. ) said at a meeting this week with members of the Knight-Ridder news bureau in Washington . Many party members gathered at the spring meeting of the Democratic National Committee in Cleveland on Friday argued that the First_Lady must be forthcoming if Democrats are to avoid becoming saddled with the Whitewater issue in the November elections . &quot; It is time for her to find the right venue in which to talk to the American people about a lot of this stuff , &quot; Lynn Cutler , a longtime party activist , told the Associated Press . &quot; Her integrity and effectiveness are at stake. &quot; Still , it was unclear whether the First_Lady would choose to answer specific questions on any TV news_shows or whether she might decline on grounds that to do so could interfere with Fiske ' s work . White_House aides were considering a joint appearance by the Clintons on the CBS-TV program &quot; 48 Hours , &quot; which is broadcast Wednesday nights . To extend its full-access public relations strategy , the White_House also planned to put its new special counsel , Lloyd N . Cutler , on three TV network news_shows on Sunday morning . As for the documents turned_over by the Treasury_Department Thursday night and Friday morning , a Treasury spokesman refused to say how many employees found relevant information in their files , computers and trash . &quot; Most of it was pretty mundane stuff , &quot; said a senior Treasury official who asked not to be identified . &quot; Thirty-seven hundred pages may sound like a lot , but in reality there ' s a lot of duplication. &quot; The official said that as much as 80 % of the material consisted_of documents generated in the preparation for congressional testimony , question-and-answer sheets for responding to media inquiries about Whitewater , press_releases and early drafts of such material . It was in February congressional testimony that Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman revealed that he had briefed top White_House officials about the criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty . Altman conducted the briefing in his role as acting director of the Resolution Trust Corp. , the Treasury_Department unit responsible_for disposing_of the assets of bankrupt savings and loan institutions . It has since been learned that Treasury_Department officials alerted White_House aides to developments in the case on a number of other occasions . Fiske this week began taking testimony under subpoena from White_House and Treasury officials . Meanwhile , Rep . Jim Leach of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee , claimed to have evidence that federal regulators may have tried to intimidate field investigators trying to find why Madison Guaranty failed . He said he had forwarded the evidence to Fiske and expected the allegations to emerge as &quot; a central issue &quot; in the controversy . Times staff writers John M . Broder , Michael Ross and James Gerstenzang contributed to this story .</TEXT>
