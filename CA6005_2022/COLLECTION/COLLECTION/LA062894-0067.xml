   <TEXT> Translators assigned to help teams and reporters in Orlando have earned widespread praise , especially from reporters who have been at other venues and found the service wanting . Christine van Loon , manager of language services in Orlando , spent four months training 35 people from 18 different countries to work_at the five games scheduled for the Florida Citrus Bowl.Together , they speak 12 languages , but none of them is a professional translator . &quot; We went_through a lot of play-acting , a lot of rehearsals , &quot; said van Loon , who speaks German , English and French . &quot; It is one thing to know a language , but you must also know soccer terms . Many people did not . I was working 14-hour days to prepare_for this. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
