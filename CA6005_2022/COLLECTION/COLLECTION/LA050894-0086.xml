   <HEADLINE> A TALE OF TWO AFRICAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last week , Washington was forced to turn its attention back to Africa , a continent that many U.S. policy-makers believe should not be a major U.S. concern . As has so often been the case , the pressure on officialdom came from stark and poignant pictures . This time , however , the pictures carried a mixed message . From South_Africa , aerial photographs of whites and blacks standing together patiently waiting to vote , in_lines that seemed to twist and turn for miles , conveyed hope and the promise of a new era . From Rwanda , scenes of a sea of brutalized and terrified refugees fleeing from genocidal violence spread despair and fear of an unfolding apocalypse that could engulf much of the continent . Responding to the democratic triumph in South_Africa , the Clinton_Administration more_than doubled U.S. aid , to $ 200 million next year . Reacting to the tragedy in Rwanda , it stepped_up its humanitarian efforts and began searching for ways to support an African peacekeeping force that could end the carnage . These moves boosted the behind-the-scenes campaign of a handful of officials who care deeply about the continent , including National Security Adviser W . Anthony Lake , to get the Administration to think seriously about Africa . But given history , there is good reason to question whether these tentative moves will bring_about a much-needed revolution in U.S. relations with the continent . Since the late 1950s , when most African states began to gain their independence , U.S. policy has moved with depressing regularity through cycles of calculated neglect and event-driven activism . During the Cold_War , the catalyst for action was fear that Moscow would profit from civil unrest and conflict . That was the case in the Belgium Congo ( now Zaire ) in the 1960s , in Angola in 1975-76 and throughout the 1980s , and in the Horn of Africa in 1978 , to name a_few . Beginning with the Biafran civil_war in 1967-69 , another recurring force for intervention has been the specter of starving children , which prompted large-scale relief efforts in the Sahel in the early 1970s , Ethiopia in 1974-75 and , more recently , in Somalia . A final factor has been racial conflict , as illustrated by the U.S. reaction to the protests against white rule that began with the Soweto uprising in 1975 and escalated exponen-tially in the early 1980s . As a result of such pressures , every President since Dwight D . Eisenhower , with the exception of Richard M . Nixon , ended_up reluctantly mounting at least one high-profile intervention in Africa . Only Presidents John F . Kennedy and Jimmy_Carter seriously attempted to deal with the underlying causes of Africa ' s crises -- and neither achieved many lasting successes . Why has Washington failed so miserably ? One of the most important reasons is the way in which the foreign-policy Establishment conceives &quot; the national interest. &quot; For them , it is mostly a matter of protecting economic and security_interests against foreign threats . Where interests are not threatened , they argue , there is little cause for involvement . But with the passing of the Cold_War , this approach to the national interest takes_on dangerous risks . It blocks policy-makers from recognizing the deeper human interests and psychological impulses that are compelling them to get involved in areas of Africa that they would prefer to ignore . In today ' s world , the gravity of threats to U.S. interests is increasingly difficult to discern . Most important , the revolution in information , communications and transportation , coupled with the emergence of a host of globally oriented movements and organizations , have changed the policy-making equation . Public attitudes are determined more by personal and group relationships than by calculations of interests . For a small but influential segment of American society , the election in South_Africa was not a distant event . For the millions who supported the anti-apartheid movement , Nelson Mandela ' s victory is a personal triumph . Many helped to raise funds for his political_campaign , while others traveled_to South_Africa to help educate voters and monitor the elections . That two of Bill_Clinton ' s chief campaign advisers , pollster Stanley B . Greenberg and media consultant Frank Greer , worked_on the Mandela campaign , that one American lawyer-activist , Gay McDougall , was appointed to South_Africa ' s Independent Election Monitoring Board , that former New York City Mayor David N . Dinkins was at Bishop Desmond M . Tutu ' s side when the latter went_to the polls and that many of America ' s leading news celebrities were_on hand for the elections -- all demonstrate the degree to which U.S. and South_African politics have become intertwined . In the case of Rwanda , the changing realities are_best reflected in the personal drama that took_place when Alison Des Forges , an American historian and human-rights activist , desperately attempted to rescue a prominent Rwandan human-rights activist , Monique Mujawamariya , trapped in Kigali . The personal bonds linking the two women are symbolic of the close connections that now exist between many Americans in the human-rights movement and their foreign counterparts . The events in South_Africa and Rwanda , therefore , matter for reasons that have little to do with narrow national interests . They matter because they strike_a_chord deep in our souls . Americans are heartened by the triumph of racial justice in South_Africa because they see it as part of a larger struggle involving many of them . Their sympathies are aroused by the horrors of Rwanda because they comprehend the humanity and have the ability to share the pain reflected in the eyes of Rwandans . Because they underestimate the power of these kinds of forces to generate pressures for responses to crises in places where no discernible U.S. interests appear endangered , Washington policy-makers are less and less able to predict where and when they will respond to foreign developments . As a result , they are increasingly finding themselves in the position of being urged to intervene in situations they have neither anticipated nor prepared_for . For example , thinking in terms of strict strategic interests encouraged the Bush_Administration to believe it could disengage from Somalia , after the Soviet threat had receded . Consequently , it failed to take early action to avert the political and humanitarian crisis that developed in the early 1990s -- and the United States ended_up paying a high price for its mistake . But the foreign-policy Establishment ' s attempt to demean , or ignore , Africa ' s current plight involves more_than high-sounding rationalizations about where the national interest lies . It is also highly irresponsible and immoral . The United States and other major_powers have played a critical role in creating the circumstances that spark the continent ' s crises . The persistent effort to attribute conflicts in Africa to deeply seeded tribal animosities is a convenient way to deflect blame for policies that aided and protected dictators . Keeping Africa off the global agenda is going_to get more difficult . Demography alone dictates that Washington and the rest of the world ' s major_powers take African developments into account . For example , as of 1991 , the population of Sub-saharan Africa was less than 500 million , while the total population of all advanced industrial countries was about 800 million . By 2025 , this balance will change radically . The African population is projected to be more_than 1.2 billion , while the population of the advanced industrial countries will be 10 % higher than where it is today . If Africa remains impoverished and conflict-ridden , its troubles will inevitably be exported . Washington ' s only real choice is to begin a serious attempt to learn from such tragedies as Rwanda and Somalia to head_off the impending tragedies in Kenya and Zaire , all_the while strengthening and building on the triumph represented by the South_African election. *</TEXT>
