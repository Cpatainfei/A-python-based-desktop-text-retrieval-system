   <HEADLINE> UNREQUITED LOVE ; AT THE FALCONRY ACADEMY , BIRDS OF PREY CAN BE TAUGHT TO SOAR , BUT NOT TO ADORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first thing a student learns at the Falconry Academy is that you always fly a bird on an empty stomach -- its , not yours . &quot; All the birds are trained by a system of reward only , &quot; Duane Zobrist II explained . &quot; A system of punishment doesn ' t work . All they know is that when they come_back to you , they ' re going to get food or you ' re going to flush game for them. &quot; And if they aren ' t hungry , it ' s bye-bye birdie . Zobrist is a son of the academy ' s owners , Duane and Sharon Zobrist of Pasadena . It opened in October on a plot of land 30 miles west of Lancaster where California 138 crosses the Los Angeles Aqueduct . It ' s the only falconry school in the country . If that ' s surprising , consider the difficulties of getting_into the sport and the dedication required to pursue it properly . In California , as in most states , an apprentice must be 14 , pass a hunter ' s safety course and a falconer ' s examination , may own only one of two birds -- a first-year redtail hawk or a kestrel -- and before he may fly birds on_his_own must study for a minimum of two years under a sponsor who is a licensed falconer . General class licensees , who must be 18 , may own two birds . It takes seven years to become a master falconer , who may own three birds , which must be cared_for like babies . For all_of that , they win neither loyalty nor devotion from the creatures . &quot; Some of the best ones will become tame and you can mistakenly believe they ' re like a pet , &quot; said Stuart Russell , the school ' s director . &quot; But you take them out two or three ounces overweight and you ' ll find out. &quot; Russell said the school ' s peregrine_falcon , Rocky , has an optimum flying weight of 1 pound 8 ounces . &quot; We weigh the birds every day , &quot; he said . &quot; If he ' s 1 pound 9 ounces , I won ' t fly him because he ' ll probably fly away . If he ' s 1 pound 7 ounces he ' ll probably be too keen and lack energy. &quot; Russell said he has lost three birds in 17 years . &quot; A kestrel I lost was a quarter-ounce overweight , &quot; he said . However , he said , the birds do get_to know their handlers . &quot; Yes , because we feed them every day . ( But ) they don ' t get_to like you. &quot; Russell arrived from England in March and plans to remain in the U.S. , teaching falconry . He is engaged to an American , who also is a falconer , which should make their marriage easier . &quot; I ' ve heard many stories of ' either the birds go or I go , ' &quot; he said . &quot; Falconers are so dedicated they ' ll stay with the birds. &quot; One recent night the younger Duane was out until midnight tracking a wayward bird . His wife , Darlene -- also a falconer -- wasn ' t concerned . &quot; She figured , ' Well , his bird flew away , ' &quot; Zobrist said . &quot; Birds are really not very bright , &quot; Russell said . &quot; If they knew what was out there , they ' d stay in captivity . In the wild , 75 % of the birds die before they ' re a year old . In captivity , it ' s about 10 % . &quot; * The Zobrists met Russell in Scotland , where for the previous six years he had been chief falconer at the_British School of Falconry , perhaps the highest regarded of 36 such schools in that country . Falconry was the first sport of kings , before horse_racing . It is still practiced with a passion in Arab countries . Russell said its history in England has been traced to the late Ninth Century . &quot; They think it started in China or possibly up in the Russian steppes and then spread down to China , and then westward with the Crusades . &quot; Originally , what falconry was for was to provide food . The goshawk is known in French as the cook ' s hawk . Probably what happened is some nomad saw a hawk kill something , chased it off its kill and had the meal for himself . After seeing that once or twice , he thought , ' Maybe I can teach it to do that for me ' -- exactly as we ' re doing now. &quot; The sport hasn ' t changed much , but the principles have been refined . &quot; They were flying some of the same species we ' re flying now -- peregrines , goshawks , saker falcons , &quot; Russell said . &quot; It doesn ' t matter if we catch anything , &quot; Duane II said . &quot; It ' s the flight that ' s important , to bring the best out of the birds. &quot; The most practical_applications might have been in World_War_II , when an English falconer , Ronald Stevens , spent most of the war on the south coast , flying peregrines to intercept homing pigeons sent by German spies from England to the European continent . Also , for the first time , trained falcons and hawks were used to keep runways clear of flocks of birds . Now it ' s purely for sport . The problem is , Russell said , that &quot; you don ' t see many young people coming_into it because there ' s no place for them to learn. &quot; The elder Zobrist , a lawyer , got hooked on the sport , he said , when he was a Boy_Scout and somebody walked into a meeting with a falcon on his fist . Now , from his 25th-floor office in downtown L.A. , he watches a peregrine family that has been roosting on the Union Bank_building for several years . Not everyone in falconry is thrilled with the Zobrists ' endeavor . Last July , Russell received a letter from Williston Shor , editor of Hawk Chalk , the newsletter of the North_American Falconers Assn . Shor wrote : &quot; I do not believe the existence of a falconry school in the U.S. is necessarily good for falconry here , nor do I think it will work. &quot; Thanking Shor for his thoughtful advice , the Zobrists decided to go_ahead anyway . Russell believes the Falconry Academy might provide a boost to what he sees as the second golden_age of falconry , the first having been in the 1800s . The basic course is five days and costs $ 350 , with a maximum of six students . For someone who only wants to see how it ' s done , a &quot; Hawking Day &quot; is $ 75 , including lunch . * The school has 18 birds , in three categories : high-soaring &quot; longwings , &quot; such_as peregrine and prairie falcons that usually take prey in flight ; &quot; broadwings , &quot; such_as redtail and Harris hawks that soar in the wild seeking ground mammals but are trained to hunt from the handler ' s fist or a perch , and &quot; shortwings , &quot; such_as goshawks , that fly from the fist and take small birds or mammals in short , direct flights in forests where the soaring birds won ' t fly . Three birds , wearing leather hoods to keep them calm , are taken a_few miles away to open fields . Mika , a Lanner falcon , will fly first . Her hood removed , she flies off low to the ground , chasing sparrows , then returns as Russell swings a bird-like lure on a line . Birds_of_prey generally have eyesight eight times as sharp as a human ' s , but handlers also use whistles to call them back . If they wander too far , they might be tracked by a tiny radio_transmitter on one leg or the bells they wear_on their talons . Russell puts a box_in the field . The box contains a pigeon -- Rocky ' s target for today . Rocky , the peregrine , uses thermal updrafts to soar to about 400 feet and &quot; waits_on &quot; in circles for a minute until the lid opens by remote_control , releasing the pigeon . Rocky banks into a dive , or &quot; stoop , &quot; that for peregrines has been measured at almost 100 m.p.h. As the pigeon darts up , down , left and right , Rocky , with his vastly superior speed , maneuvers to keep his quarry upwind , giving himself the tactical advantage . Every time the pigeon tries to turn downwind , Rocky cuts him off . Finally , he makes two passes at the pigeon but -- luckily for the pigeon -- scores only a pair of near-misses . Russell calls him back . As small as it is , a peregrine also preys on much larger birds , including pheasants and ducks . It could probably take_down large mammals , including a man , if it chose to . &quot; The good ones will hit ( prey ) in the head , &quot; Russell said . &quot; Imagine that you were running_along as fast as you could go and a pound-and-a-half object hit you on the side of the face at 100 m.p.h. You ' re not going_to get_up from that . Then it ' ll come straight back , bite you on the neck and sever your vertebra. &quot; There is no kill , but the falconers are delighted with Rocky ' s performance . &quot; The usual hunting success is about 30 % , &quot; Duane II said . &quot; But that ' s secondary to the flight . Rocky was tremendous. &quot; Information on the Falconry Academy is available by calling ( 800 ) 546-1165 .</TEXT>
