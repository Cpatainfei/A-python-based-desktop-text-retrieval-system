   <HEADLINE> HUMAN_RIGHTS STILL A CENTRAL ELEMENT , U.S. OFFICIALS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration said Friday that promoting human_rights will remain a central element in U.S. policy toward China even though the issue is no longer linked with trade . &quot; We have focused a brighter spotlight on human_rights practices in China . That scrutiny will continue , and our human_rights dialogue with China will intensify , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said . His remarks were part of an effort by the Administration to rebut suggestions by opposition politicians and human_rights groups that by renewing China ' s most-favored-nation trading status unconditionally , President Clinton caved_in to Beijing . The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Madeleine Albright , denied that Clinton ' s shift was a sign of weakness . &quot; On the contrary , I think this is a very important step_in showing American resolve , &quot; she said . She said Clinton ' s is a policy that &quot; shows strength , that shows the ability to know what is important for the United States and to know the importance of how to pursue a policy of human_rights as well as a policy of engagement with China. &quot; Christopher , in a speech to the Asia Society in New York made available in Washington , said the Administration will work with U.S. business_leaders to develop principles to improve working conditions and will make_it a practice to meet with a wide range of Chinese citizens . He said Beijing had told the United States that greater progress on human_rights could be made even without the MFN linkage and &quot; now we will give them a chance. &quot; Revoking MFN , he said , would have led to a &quot; downward spiral in U.S.-China relations &quot; . Christopher put the China decision in the context of what he called a comprehensive U.S. strategy of engagement and leadership in the Asia-Pacific region . This also includes new trade negotiations with Japan , efforts to solve nuclear problems with North_Korea and U.S.-Vietnamese agreement on establishing liaison offices in each other ' s capitals . The State_Department released a summary of Christopher ' s report and recommendations that conceded that China had not made the &quot; overall , significant progress &quot; on five areas of human_rights that had been required for renewal of MFN in an executive order signed by Clinton last year . The report said China was complying with an agreement barring exports to the United states of goods made by prison labor , although officials acknowledged that there was &quot; some evidence &quot; that such exports were continuing . The report also said negotiations with the International Red_Cross had not yielded any Chinese agreement to permit access to prisons , and Tibetans were continuing to be jailed for peaceful protests in support of political and religious independence . Human_rights groups have condemned Clinton ' s decision , accusing the President of caving_in to big business . Deputy National Security Adviser Samuel Berger , speaking on ABC television ' s &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; program , defended the new policy of engagement . Clinton had to decide whether to sever &quot; a $ 40-billion relationship that has enormous importance to the security and economic &quot; interests of the United States , Berger said , or &quot; whether we pursue human_rights better through a policy of contact , of engagement , in which we press the human_rights agenda but not through threatening to sever the entire relationship. &quot;</TEXT>
