   <HEADLINE> AT LAST , THE WEST SHOWS SOME SPINE ; POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS QUICKLY FOLLOW JET ATTACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Monday U.S. F-16 fighters flying for NATO shot down four Serbian warplanes returning from a bombing raid on a Bosnian munitions plant . On Tuesday , after talks in Moscow , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that for the first time in two years his forces will allow aid flights into the besieged Muslim town of Tuzla . Did the air_attack cause the change ? NATO and Russia were sharing ( or competing for ) credit . Karadzic linked the opening of the Tuzla airport not to the NATO attack but to a Russian commitment to send peacekeepers to Tuzla to keep_out military deliveries . U.S.-SPONSORED PACT : The airport opening thus parallels the silencing of the Serb artillery around Sarajevo as an action that places Russia and NATO in de_facto cooperation . Washington and London welcomed the Tuzla announcement , and Russia , significantly , did not condemn the NATO attack . Bosnian Muslim skepticism about the benevolent intent of Russian troops on Bosnian soil is understandable , but more important , perhaps , is the fact that both Karadzic and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev described their talks as difficult . For the Serbs , the new developments in Sarajevo and Tuzla may be a retreat rather than a defeat , but a retreat is still a far_cry from victory , and the Tuzla announcement occasioned no Serb elation . While the Bosnian Serbs , under Russian pressure , were opening the Tuzla airport , the Bosnian Muslims and Croats , under U.S. pressure , were signing an agreement in Washington for a binational , Muslim-Croat Bosnian state in federation with Croatia . The three-way ethnic partition of Bosnia proposed by European Union negotiators has now clearly been set_aside . Monday ' s NATO attack , though directed at Serbian planes , seems to have strengthened the shaky Croatian-Muslim truce in areas where there had been fighting even as negotiations grew more serious in Washington . NO VIETNAM : This should not come as a huge surprise . The Balkans are not to be compared with Vietnam in population , strategic location or political position . Vietnam , with three times the Balkans ' population , is halfway around the world from the United States and during the Vietnam_War enjoyed the advantage of secure overland supply_lines and the backing of a superpower only too happy to see its rival bogged down in an unwinnable war . The Balkans lie next door to Italy , a NATO member , and lack secure supply_lines and the ability to play one superpower against the other . All that had been wanting to make these factors yield peace was a demonstration that the major_powers were prepared to use their overwhelming military advantage . As this demonstration has come , the impact has been dramatic and immediate . The lesson to be drawn is painfully obvious . One can only regret that it was not drawn two years ago , on behalf of Croatia as well as Bosnia , sparing Europe thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees , not to speak_of a debilitating doubt about the state of its collective_security .</TEXT>
