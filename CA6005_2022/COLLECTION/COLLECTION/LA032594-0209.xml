   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICA ; U.S. EMBASSY SMARTING IN BOLIVIA STING OPERATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Embassy in Bolivia participated in a sting operation aimed at proving that the president of the Bolivian Supreme Court was soliciting a bribe from a U.S. citizen . The court ' s president and another justice are now on_trial in the Senate , and the embassy is_on trial in the press . The case offers a telling taste of Bolivian politics , a murky stew that often smacks of back-room deals , corruption and U.S. intervention . Supreme Court President Edgar Oblitas and Justice Ernesto Poppe are suspended from the court pending the outcome of their Senate trial . The U.S. Embassy is trying to keep a low profile , but its name keeps popping_up in the proceedings and press coverage . In statements to the press , Oblitas has accused the embassy of trying to destroy the current Supreme Court and replace it with one that would be submissive to U.S. wishes . In a confidential letter to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry that leaked_out to newspapers , the embassy said it does not wish to involve itself in Bolivia ' s internal affairs or influence judicial processes , but &quot; wants only what all Bolivians want : a system of justice that is honest and impartial. &quot; The trouble began in January , 1993 , when the government of Nicaragua requested the extradition of Jose Antonio Ibarra , a former Nicaraguan vice minister under President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro . Ibarra , wanted on charges of embezzlement , was then teaching university courses in the Bolivian city of Cochabamba . Ibarra has testified that he received a request in the name of Poppe for $ 5 # 000 to settle the extradition case in Ibarra ' s favor . He told U.S. officials of the request , asking_for help because he has U.S. as well as Nicaraguan citizenship . David Dlouy , the No . 2 U.S. diplomat in Bolivia , reported the request to Oblitas in June . Oblitas took no official action . In September , Ibarra told U.S. officials of a $ 15 # 000 bribe request from former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Galindo in Oblitas ' name . U.S. and Bolivian officials decided to try to trap Galindo in a sting operation . The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration installed a camera in Ibarra ' s Cochabamba home before Galindo visited him on Sept . 30 , and the hidden camera recorded Ibarra handing Galindo $ 1 # 000 in marked bills as a &quot; down payment. &quot; On Oct . 4 , the Supreme Court rejected the extradition request . Authorities filed charges against Oblitas and Poppe that same month , and the lower house of Congress sent the case to the Senate for trial in January . Oblitas ' defense_attorney , Juan Carlos Lazcano , said there is no evidence directly linking the Supreme Court president to any bribe requests . Independent analysts observe , however , that the Senate will not necessarily be bound by legal rules_of_evidence in what is essentially a political trial . One of Lazcano ' s tactics apparently is to win support from nationalist politicians who oppose a presidential plan to privatize government enterprises . Lazcano said the government wants to remove Oblitas because he opposes privatization . Another tactic appears aimed at arousing indignation over U.S. intervention . Lazcano said the U.S. Embassy wants Oblitas out because he has led the court in blocking the extradition of Bolivians wanted in the United States for drug trafficking . Setting the Trap The events leading_up to the sting operation that ensnared two Bolivian Supreme Court justices : 1 . Nicaragua asks Bolivia to extradite former Vice Minister Jose Antonio Ibarra to face embezzlement charges . 2 . Ibarra informs U.S. officials that he received a request in the name of Supreme Court Justice Ernesto Poppe for $ 5 # 000 to prevent the extradition ( Ibarra has U.S citizenship ) . 3 . American diplomat in Bolivia reports the alleged request to Bolivia ' s president , who takes no official action . 4 . Ibarra tells U.S. officials of a second , $ 15 # 000 bribe request from former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Galindo in the Supreme Court president ' s name . 5 . U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration installs video camera in Ibarra ' s home . Camera records Ibarra allegedly handing Galindo $ 1 # 000 in marked bills as a &quot; down payment. &quot;</TEXT>
