   <HEADLINE> GREENSPAN SIGNALS INTEREST_RATE HIKE ; ECONOMY : CENTRAL_BANK MAY HAVE TO RAISE BORROWING COSTS TO PREVENT A NEW SPURT IN INFLATION , FED CHIEF WARNS . ACTION IS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL MARCH AT EARLIEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Congress Monday that his agency may have to raise interest_rates to prevent the economic recovery from triggering a new spurt of inflation . Describing the current short-term rates -- less than 3 % for three-month Treasury_bills -- as &quot; abnormally low , &quot; he said that , unless there is an &quot; unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity , we will need to move them to a more neutral stance. &quot; The Federal_Reserve ' s policy-making committee , which is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday , must consider &quot; when is the appropriate time to move to a somewhat less accommodative level of short-term interest_rates , &quot; Greenspan said in testimony before Congress ' Joint Economics Committee . He said that the Fed will have to decide how long to &quot; continue monetary accommodation without sowing the seeds of another bout of inflationary instability accompanied by steeply rising long-term rates. &quot; However , action on interest_rates is not expected by economists until March at the earliest . President Clinton , responding to Greenspan ' s remarks , told reporters at the White_House later Monday that he hoped any increase in short-term rates would not be followed by an increase in long-term rates , &quot; because there ' s no need to do it. &quot; &quot; We ' ve still got good , strong growth in this economy , &quot; he said . &quot; But we want to manage it with real discipline ; that is , we don ' t want to have one of these roller-coaster things . We want the economy to grow in a very stable , solid way and , obviously , low interest_rates are critical to that. &quot; Clinton made_it clear that he expects cooperation in the effort to hold_down both inflation and interest_rates : &quot; I consider that part of the kind of compact that we ' ve all made where we ' ll continue to reduce the deficit , and we ' ve got_to keep inflation down and interest_rates down so that people can afford to borrow money and invest. &quot; Greenspan ' s comments were couched in the customary cautious language that members of the Federal_Reserve_Board use when addressing the sensitive issue of interest_rates . But they nevertheless signaled a readiness to move toward higher interest_rates , as well as a heightened concern that the economic muscle being exercised throughout much of the nation -- struggling Southern California is the major exception -- must be watched carefully so that growth is not allowed to ignite inflation . The Federal_Reserve chairman and other economists emphasized the need to shift from longstanding policy and strike preemptively against inflation because , once prices begin to rise , the dramatic steps needed to bring them under_control risk creating a recession . Taking action in_advance of solid evidence that inflation is occurring , however , goes_against conventional economic procedure , in which measures are put_in place only after specific data indicates they are needed . The Federal_Reserve ' s decisions have impact far beyond the financial instruments it controls -- its own short-term loans to commercial_banks , for example . Other short-term rates usually follow the Fed ' s lead . Higher rates make_it more expensive for businesses to borrow and expand ; they put a leash on inflation , but also on the creation of jobs by retarding overall economic activity . On the consumer level , increases imposed by the Federal_Reserve eventually can translate into higher rates for auto loans and adjustable-rate mortgages , as well as for bank_deposits . More generally , statements by Federal_Reserve officials are so widely respected that they tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies . A forecast of good times ahead , for example , can send Americans scurrying to make just the kinds of investments that promote economic_growth . The federal funds rate , the rate charged for overnight loans among banks , hit a peak of 9.75 % in 1989 . The rate has held steady since September , 1992 , when it fell to a nearly 30-year low of 3 % . Even as he said that &quot; the foundations of the economic expansion are looking increasingly well-entrenched , &quot; Greenspan said that the expansion has been uneven and that weakness abroad has restrained U.S. exports . But , he said , accelerating domestic economic activity &quot; has put some upward pressure on prices. &quot; &quot; By the time inflation pressures are evident , many imbalances that are costly to rectify have already developed and only harsh monetary therapy can restore the financial stability necessary to sustain growth , &quot; he said . Inflation in 1993 was 2.7 % , the lowest rate since 1965 , with the exception of 1986 . Greenspan ' s comments coincided with a high-flying day on Wall_Street , during which the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.93 points , to close at a record high of 3 # 978.36. At the same time , the bond market was mixed , with traders largely discounting the prediction of higher interest_rates because anxious investors already had anticipated such increases . During Monday ' s hearing , Rep . David R . Obey ( D-Wis. ) , chairman of the Joint Economic Committee , urged Greenspan to delay as much as possible imposing any increase in interest_rates , &quot; given the limited number of indicators that inflation is around the corner. &quot; Greenspan did not respond . Allen Sinai , chief economist at Lehman Bros . in New York , praised efforts to take action in_advance of clear evidence that inflation is occurring . But he said that any action before March is unlikely , because the next set of economic figures -- those for January -- would be skewed by the freezing temperatures in the East and the earthquake in California .</TEXT>
