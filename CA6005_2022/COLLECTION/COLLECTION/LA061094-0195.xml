   <TEXT> After making a small_fortune as an importer in Taiwan , Taung Ming-Lin came_to America with the dream of turning the soil into a garden of bamboo and bok choy and Chinese bitter melon . He took one look_at the fields rolling_out lush and incandescent in Kern County and plunked_down $ 1.65 million . Problem was , the 723 acres he bought three years ago turned_out to be just about the most Godforsaken land in these parts . He set_out to make his desert bloom , pouring in another $ 200 # 000 for equipment and a water well . He didn ' t know about the salt in the soil that stunted his bamboo . And he certainly didn ' t know about any Tipton kangaroo_rats or blunt-nosed leopard_lizards or San Joaquin kit_foxes . Today , the 51-year-old Lin stands accused by the U.S._government of destroying the habitat of endangered species . His tractor and disc have been seized as murder weapons . &quot; I wanted to make bamboo and bok choy part of the American diet , &quot; he said through a translator . &quot; But the government showed me this dead rat and then they took my tractor and disc . Now my land is worthless. &quot; Conservatives from Rush Limbaugh to Michael Huffington have seized upon the plight of the 5-foot-4 immigrant , who speaks no English and carries a lucky jade dragon , as one more example of the federal environmental bureaucracy gone mad . In this region that gave_rise to its own brand of country-Western music and remains home to more_than a_few John Birchers , the issue is white and black . It ' s farmer versus rat ; farmer versus feds . On a recent Saturday , the Kern County Farm Bureau and the Coalition to Protect and Preserve Private_Property Rights threw a huge rally in support of Lin and other growers who have run_afoul of the 1973 Endangered Species Act . Hundreds of tractors and big-rig trucks rumbled through the quiet streets of downtown Bakersfield . Crop dusters roared overhead . Lin , looking slightly befuddled in his blue_jeans and tennis_shoes , rode near the front of the cavalcade on the wheels of a gargantuan tractor . &quot; Fight or lose your job to the BureaucRATS , &quot; read one sign . &quot; Three Rats and You ' re Out , &quot; read another , even though it was five kangaroo_rats that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says it found on Lin ' s property . At a tri-tip beef barbecue that followed , cotton and tomato farmer Tim Thomson tried to explain the passion . &quot; What the federal_government has done to Mr. Lin is no different than if they found one of these kangaroo_rats under your back_porch and asked you to move_out of your house but continue to pay the mortgage . It just isn ' t American. &quot; Lin ' s lawyer would also argue that the case harks back to an older and more sordid tale of California real_estate swindles . &quot; The real_estate professionals involved saw this naive foreign investor who didn ' t speak the language and they swindled him , pure_and_simple , &quot; said Daniel Rudnick , Lin ' s attorney . He is preparing to sue the seller , Tenneco Inc. , to rescind the transaction and the two real_estate_agents for fraud . &quot; You can ' t give that ground away . It ' s got endangered species on it . It ' s a liability. &quot; Tenneco says it wasn ' t aware that the land , which sat idle for years , was considered habitat for several endangered species . And it says it did not sell the land as farmland . &quot; We were approached with an unsolicited offer to buy the land and Mr. Lin had an opportunity to inspect it and get a third-party opinion as_to its value , &quot; said Christine LeLaurin , a Tenneco spokeswoman in Houston . &quot; We feel bad for the guy , you bet . But it was no swindle. &quot; Joe Garone , a longtime Bakersfield farmer and one of the realty agents who represented Lin , chuckled when asked if the land could sustain crops . &quot; I don ' t think I ' m guilty of anything , but I don ' t see how I have anything to gain by talking to the media , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s the federal_government that needs to be reined in. &quot; Lin came_to America in 1990 with his wife and three of four children . He gave_up a lucrative career as an importer of U.S.-made refrigerators and air-conditioning units to open a small bookbinding firm in El Monte , which he still runs . He and the family live_in El Monte and Lin travels frequently to Bakersfield . But he kept dreaming about the life of a farmer , he said , remembering his 84-year-old father still tilling eight acres of peanuts and rice on an island west of Taiwan , happy as can be . &quot; I have never farmed , but it ' s in my blood , &quot; Lin said . &quot; My idea was to sell the bookbinding company one day and go_back to the soil. &quot; A now-defunct Monterey Park real_estate firm told Lin about the fertile San Joaquin Valley on the other side of the Tehachapis . He made one trip_up and then another before deciding in February , 1991 , to buy a large parcel 100 miles north of Los Angeles near Interstate 5 -- past the sleepy farm towns of Pumpkin Center and Panama and Old River . A more bereft piece of earth -- at least from a farmer ' s perspective -- would be hard to imagine . But Lin looked past the tumbleweeds and snakes and salt-encrusted soil . He looked_to the horizon . &quot; Acres and acres of green . Farmland . Cotton . Alfalfa , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s all I saw. &quot; He said neither the realty agent in Monterey Park nor Garone in Bakersfield , who split the sales commission , nor Tenneco told him it would take years of irrigation to leach out the deadly salts and turn the 723 acres into marginal cropland at best . And the escrow papers , he said , never mentioned a word about endangered species . Lin said Tenneco even plowed the land clean before he handed_over the $ 310 # 000 down_payment , removing all signs of virgin desert . In early February , after Lin sank a $ 100 # 000 well , bought a $ 50 # 000 tractor , planted five acres of bamboo and watched every third plant wither , a state agent with the Department of Fish and Game knocked_on the trailer door of Lin ' s farm manager , Robert Sanchez . Did you know this was critical habitat for three endangered species ? Have you obtained the necessary state or federal permit to till the land ? Sanchez answered , &quot; No , &quot; and a_few days later , according to the federal complaint , he proceeded to plow under another swath of scrubland . On Feb . 20 , more_than two_dozen state and federal_agents , accompanied by helicopters , descended on the farm . They &quot; arrested &quot; the tractor and disc , according to court papers , and found &quot; five suspected Tipton kangaroo_rat carcasses and / or parts thereof. &quot; They charged Lin with three violations of the Endangered Species Act , which prohibits harming about 600 species of imperiled animals and plants and protects their natural surroundings . He faces_up to a year in prison and $ 300 # 000 in criminal and civil fines . The show of force rankled people here . The feds say they were just doing their job . &quot; It ' s pretty simple , &quot; said Assistant U.S. Atty . Karen Kalmanir . &quot; We ' re enforcing the Endangered Species Act . This was an unlawful and knowing take of habitat. &quot; Kalmanir said Lin continued to destroy the habitat after he had been warned . Kalmanir is fresh from the prosecution of a Tulare County farmer who destroyed a portion of the habitat of the blunt-nosed leopard_lizard , which is found only in the southern San Joaquin Valley . Tule Vista Farms entered a guilty plea , was fined $ 5 # 000 and agreed to sell 100 acres and deed 60 acres more to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . Arthur Unger , president of the local Sierra Club , supports the federal_government action and wonders why Lin , a man who is savvy enough to run a successful import business , would fail to know the law . &quot; Why should we protect the kangaroo_rat ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Because it ' s part of the web of life and it happens to be one of the principal foods for the foxes , bobcats and coyotes out there . How can we sit here and play God and say ' This species we ' ll let_go ? ' &quot; At a rally and barbecue for Lin and others , E.G. Berchtold told the crowd of 500 that the tractor he sold to Lin had been seized and it remained in federal custody as Exhibit No . 1 . &quot; The United States of America vs . One Ford Tractor , &quot; he laughed . &quot; You can ' t believe what we ' re going to have to do to get that tractor back. &quot; &quot; Well , let ' s go get_it right now , &quot; a burly man shouted . &quot; Yeah , &quot; the crowd roared . &quot; Let ' s go get it. &quot; &quot; Come see me afterward , &quot; Berchtold smiled . Lin stood onstage clutching a stuffed mouse someone had given him . His tiny frame was half-covered by the American flag and he looked a little lost amid the Hillary Clinton and Janet Reno jokes . Half his face drooped from a small stroke he blames on his troubles . Politicians running_for office kept wanting to shake his hand . &quot; I am disappointed in American government , &quot; he said . &quot; But my feelings toward the people are very warm. &quot;</TEXT>
