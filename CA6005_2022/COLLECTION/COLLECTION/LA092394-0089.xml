   <HEADLINE> 3-HOUR TOUR : SCIENCE ' S HALL OF FAME ; TO WALK THROUGH CALTECH IS TO REVISIT EINSTEIN , OPPENHEIMER , MILLIKAN AND OTHER 20TH-CENTURY LIONS OF THE FIELD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Caltech . The very name conjures headlines of seismology and Richter scales , of outer space and underwater exploration , of Einstein , Oppenheimer , Pauling and other marquee names in physics and chemistry . As one of the world ' s premier research schools of science and engineering , the 103-year-old California Institute of Technology is a mouse that roars -- only 900 undergraduates and 1 # 100 graduate_students with dreams that reach not just for stars but whole galaxies . This is where Albert Einstein served as a visiting scholar in the early 1930s , where J . Robert Oppenheimer consulted while siring the atomic_bomb , where Linus Pauling determined how atoms form molecules , where Charles Richter helped give_birth to the modern study of earthquakes . It has produced 23 Nobel Prize_winners ever since astronomer George Ellery Hale , the first director of the Mount Wilson Observatory , and others founded it . In 1920 , they gave what had begun modestly in 1891 as Amos G . Throop University -- a local arts and crafts school -- a new name ( California Institute of Technology ) , a fresh_start in problem-solving and a vision that could see forever . Once-per-weekday tours of the 124-acre campus are aimed mainly at prospective students ( separate architectural tours require reservations and occur on the fourth Thursday of each month except July , August and December ; because of Thanksgiving , November tours occur on the third Thursday ) . A video that starts the tour celebrates Caltech ' s centennial and rekindles the first impressions in 1931 of a freshman named Willy Fowler , who would become one of the school ' s renowned physicists . &quot; I saw Robert Millikan and Albert Einstein in a heated discussion on the steps , &quot; Fowler recalls . &quot; I said , ' Boy ! This is the place to be ! ' &quot; 1:45 p.m. : Tourists should report first to Caltech ' s public relations and visitors center at 315 S . Hill Ave . Here , the 15-minute video explores not just the school ' s history and pedigree but also its world-class reputation for student pranks . Examples : Caltech insurgents reconfigured a UCLA card stunt at halftime of the 1984 Rose Bowl game to read : &quot; GO CIT. &quot; And during the seniors ' annual &quot; Ditch Day &quot; in 1987 , others changed Los Angeles ' famed hillside letters -- from HOLLYWOOD to CALTECH . Says one faculty_member : &quot; A lot of us are here because we can ' t wait for the next prank. &quot; 2 p.m. : It ' s a sprawling campus of 100 buildings -- grouped by scientific_disciplines and arranged in some places to resemble Mediterranean plazas , with courtyards , arcades and handsome landscaping , eucalyptus_trees and evergreens . It ' s unhurried and uncrowded here -- owing to Caltech ' s ratio of just three students for every faculty_member . Our student guide , a senior from Escondido , backpedals as she talks , leading a dozen visitors south on Hill Avenue past a mansion that serves as campus residence of Thomas E . Everhart , Caltech ' s president since 1987 . She looks_back on four exhausting years of academic pressure among peers who ranked in the top 1 % of their high_school classes . &quot; Around here , &quot; she says , &quot; we tend to forget the real world. &quot; Turning right on San Pasqual Street , we soon enter North House -- one of seven on-campus residence_halls patterned not so_much after fraternities but Oxford_University ' s family-style of housing . About 60 % of Caltech ' s students live_on campus . North House is a remodeled 1960s-vintage dormitory with bunk_beds designed by students to relieve overcrowding . On the main floor is a room lined with about 60 personal_computers . Each house has such a facility , with all terminals linked to a central campus-wide network and free electronic_mail anywhere -- a perk to students who loathe writing letters . 2:15 p.m. : A few steps beyond North House sits an impressive Italian Renaissance-style building named the Athenaeum , which serves faculty and staff . &quot; It ' s our version of an officers ' club , &quot; the guide says . With its archways , tile_roof and courtyard , Athenaeum also has served as a location site for feature_films such_as &quot; Beverly Hills Cop &quot; ( 1984 ) and &quot; The War of the Roses &quot; ( 1989 ) . 2:30 p.m. : We pass South House , a more elegant residence_hall built_in the 1930s , and the Winnett Student_Center , a brick building that contains the bookstore , coffeehouse lounge , piano room and Caltech ' s YMCA chapter . Along a nearby sidewalk , a turn-of-the-century cannon looms -- a three-ton relic of the Franco-Prussian War on loan from Southwestern Academy in nearby San Marino ( and sometimes pilfered by prankish students from Harvey Mudd College in Claremont , the guide says ) . A cannon blast ( &quot; harmless -- but noisy , &quot; school officials say ) fires about six times a year to herald important events such_as final-exams week and commencement . 2:45 p.m. : Farther along the walkway is a knot of buildings including the Firestone ( applied mathematics and flight sciences ) and Guggenheim ( aeronautics and applied physics ) laboratories . The Guggenheim Laboratory , which once tested the late Howard Hughes ' Spruce Goose aircraft , contains wind- and shock-tunnels enabling the study of how aircraft perform at high speeds and high altitude . 3 p.m. : Near the west_end of the campus , the nine-story Millikan Library ( named for physicist Robert A . Millikan , who helped George Ellery Hale start Caltech on its new mission in 1921 ) dominates the landscape . The library , completed in 1967 , was built to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 8.0 , officials say . During the 1971 Sylmar quake , the building survived , but countless books toppled along with their shelves ( which now are bolted to walls ) . Nearby is the Arms Laboratory ( geological and planetary sciences ) , which is said to house the largest collection of gems and minerals in the Southwestern United States . 3:10 p.m. : Mudd Laboratory-South , at the school ' s southwesternmost corner ( California Boulevard and Wilson Avenue ) , cuts an even taller public profile than the Millikan Library . It ' s Caltech ' s so-called Seismic Center , where Kate Hutton and other scientists hold court amid swarms of reporters and TV cameras after major Southern California earthquakes and aftershocks . Here , instruments record an average of 30 earthquakes ( mostly small ) a day , the guide tells visitors . She points to cylinders of white_paper nicknamed the &quot; Pasadena Drum , &quot; a seismograph whose wavy lines become jagged whenever a high-magnitude quake occurs . &quot; Not much is going_on today , &quot; she says , with relief . 3:15 p.m. : Near mid-campus sits a white circular building with a pointed roof . It ' s Beckman Auditorium , scene of lectures , concerts , dance recitals and theatrical programs that attract crowds from across Greater Los Angeles . Close by are the Beckman Institute , where biologists interact with chemists , and the Beckman Laboratories of Behavioral Biology , representing Caltech ' s role as one of the first schools to conduct major studies of the brain and nervous_system . 3:30 p.m. : At tour ' s end , you can dodge the start of rush_hour by strolling to the Pie ' N Burger ( 913 E . California Blvd. ) , a down-home , family-style cafe which , like Caltech , is a neighborhood institution -- popular_with students and faculty for three decades . &quot; My son likes it because they still make sodas there the old-fashioned way , &quot; one Caltech employee says of the Pie ' N Burger , 1 1 / 2 blocks from the campus . &quot; They pour the syrup and mix it all up right in front of you. &quot; Where and When What : Public tours of the Caltech campus . Public relations and visitors center , 315 S . Hill Ave. , Pasadena . When : 2 p.m. Mondays through Fridays ( except on holidays or winter break ) , preceded by showing of video at 1:45 p.m. Separate architectural tours occur on the fourth Thursday of each month ( except for July , August and December ; because of Thanksgiving , November tours occur on the third Thursday ) . Price : Free . Call : ( 818 ) 395-6327 .</TEXT>
