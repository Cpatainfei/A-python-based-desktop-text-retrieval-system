   <HEADLINE> WESTERN ENVOYS TO GLOBAL POPULATION MEETING PUSH COMPROMISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As delegates gathered amid tight security for today ' s opening of a U.N. conference on world population , U.S. and European envoys attempted Sunday to defuse Vatican and Islamic objections to a draft plan that deals with abortion and other sensitive issues . Compromise proposals being circulated centered_on controversial language dealing with definitions of &quot; reproductive rights &quot; and the family ; sex education and family-planning services for teen-agers , and abortion . These issues , while constituting less than 10 % of the U.N. draft , have emerged as the major stumbling_block to consensus at the International Conference on Population and Development , which is aimed at forging a strategy to stabilize population at a_level considered environmentally sustainable . &quot; The outstanding questions are important , but they should not be allowed to overshadow the great progress we have made , &quot; said Nafis Sadik , executive_director of the U.N. Population Fund and secretary_general of the conference . In private meetings this weekend , U.S. officials urged nonaligned nations to accept compromise language drafted over the summer by the European Union , participants said . U.S. officials expressed optimism that the proposal would emerge as the vehicle for breaking the logjam because it enjoys support from a broad spectrum of countries , ranging from socially conservative Ireland to the liberal Scandinavian_nations . At the same time , advocates of the compromise acknowledged they still must overcome stiff resistance from the Vatican and Islamic countries , where religious authorities have criticized the document as condoning homosexuality and extramarital_sex . Egypt is said to be seeking support from Iran in removing language that many Islamic leaders see as condoning homosexuality , in particular a sentence urging an end to discrimination against &quot; other unions &quot; besides traditional marriage . Caribbean nations sought to include the phrase to cover common-law_marriages , which are a tradition in those countries , according to a member of the U.S. delegation . One of the most controversial passages , on reproductive health , has been attacked by conservative Catholics and Islamists as advocating a universal right to abortion . The compromise seeks to preempt that criticism by stating that policy on reproductive matters &quot; is the sovereign right of each nation , consistent with the national laws and in conformity with international human-rights standards. &quot;</TEXT>
