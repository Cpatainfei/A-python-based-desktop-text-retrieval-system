   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SPOTLIGHT ; THEIR ENTHUSIASM MIGHT BE FLAGGING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Switzerland might not boast the best team in the tournament , but expect no serious challengers for biggest flag . In support of their team , making its first World Cup appearance in 28 years , the_Swiss carted to Detroit a national_flag estimated to be larger than the tarp that covers the infield at Tiger Stadium . It has been draped between two cranes on Opdyke Road east of the Pontiac Silverdome . Two more shabby World Cup performances and the_Swiss can use the flag to sail home . CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
