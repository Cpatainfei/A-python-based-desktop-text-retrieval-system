   <TEXT> High-level international summits often abound with empty ceremonial discourse , but there was more_than pomp and palaver at the fourth annual Ibero-American Summit . A growing sense of Latin_American unity , a feeling of community , emanated from the air-conditioned halls here as Latin_America ' s presidents met last week with leaders from Spain and Portugal . For the most part , Latin_America ' s flock of nations seemed to be flying in formation -- at different speeds , with much fluttering and flapping and some falling_out of line here and there . But countries of this huge region are beginning to look_like birds of a feather . Could it be that liberator Simon Bolivar ' s dream of a great Latin_American union is finally coming true ? Not yet , although it seems more possible than ever . Latin_American countries are drawn_together by culture , history and geography . And since the beginning of the 1990s , almost all_of them also share a common_denominator of democracy , albeit imperfect . All of this has helped the yearly Ibero-American Summit become a friendly forum for promoting regional solidarity and integration . The theme of this year ' s summit was &quot; Trade and Integration as Elements of Ibero-American Development. &quot; The final declaration , signed by all 21 participating countries , emphasized the goal of &quot; stimulating processes of regional integration through free-trade agreements and economic complementation. &quot; In an example of progress toward free_trade among economies that once were heavily protected by tariff barriers , three major Latin_American countries signed a new free-trade agreement on the eve of the Cartagena summit . Mexico , Colombia and Venezuela -- calling themselves the Group of Three , or G-3 -- are to eliminate all tariffs on mutual trade within 12 years . The G-3 pact is the latest of several free-trade agreements in Latin_America , some overlapping . Mexico , for example , has a free-trade accord with Chile , as well as being a signatory of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada . And Colombia and Venezuela belong_to the Andean Pact . The Cartagena declaration said the final goal for all subregional trade agreements should be their convergence in a single hemispheric project , NAFTA included . That goal seems more realistic today than it ever might have , partly because the consolidation of democracy in Latin_America has brought closer relations among governments with similar principles and ideals . Hopes for regional integration are also based on an almost unanimous movement by Latin_American governments toward policies favoring market_economies with reduced public sectors and increasingly free_trade . And , as Chilean President Eduardo Frei said after the summit , Latin_America feels more need than ever for the strength of economic unity as it sees Europe , North_America and eastern Asia forming powerful trade blocs . &quot; This is the reality , &quot; Frei said . &quot; I believe our union is fundamental. &quot; The odd man out_in all_of this is President Fidel Castro of Communist Cuba . Castro attended the Cartagena summit and signed the final declaration but made no public concessions to entreaties by other presidents for democratic and market reforms in Cuba . Unless such reforms are made , several presidents warned , Cuba will be left by the wayside as other Latin_American countries wing their way toward hemispheric unity . In contrast , and even though Castro ' s nemesis to the north often was mistrusted and resented by other Latin_Americans in the past , most governments of the region are now eager to include the United States in their integration plans . Many hope to start negotiating with Washington on trade agreements similar to Mexico ' s with NAFTA , and almost all are looking_forward to a hemispheric summit_meeting scheduled by President Clinton for December in Miami .</TEXT>
