   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : NEW SAFETY NET FOR TRAVELERS LEFT HOLDING THE BAG ; CONSUMERS : LANDMARK STATE LAW PROVIDES RESTITUTION IF TOUR OPERATORS AND TRAVEL_AGENCIES DON ' T DELIVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It took years of legislative wrangling in Sacramento -- not to mention an unprecedented act of self-regulation among this state ' s travel industry leaders -- but California consumers now have a landmark law aimed at protecting them when travel_agencies and tour operators skip_town or go bust . The bill ( AB 918 ) , sponsored as by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier ( D-Burlingame ) , was backed by the Legislature in August and signed by Gov . Pete Wilson on Sept . 29 . It establishes a travel restitution fund for consumers , which is expected to reach $ 1.6 million . The cost of creating and maintaining that fund will be carried by sellers of travel -- tour operators and travel_agents , principally -- who will pay $ 325 in fees for each of their offices in 1995 and an anticipated $ 100- $ 125 in 1996 . The bill is not aimed at airlines , hotels and cruise companies , but at the thousands of intermediary companies that arrange trips , collect money from consumers and pass it along to transportation and lodging providers . Once the fund is in place , if a consumer advances money to a registered company and the firm fails or vanishes , the consumer may be able to recover his or her losses , up_to $ 15 # 000 per person . ( Refunds may be possible in the case of U.S. hotel failures if the hotel is part of a tour package ; foreign companies are essentially uncovered by the law. ) State and tourism officials expect to spend 1995 collecting fees and setting_up the new system , with the law to take full effect in January , 1996 . Industry authorities agree that the law is the first of its kind in the nation : Basically , after years of criticism over its lack of professionalism , the industry is taxing itself to build consumer trust , and ceding oversight of the program to government officials . The legislation grew from two years of negotiation and compromise between leaders of the California Coalition of Travel Organizations ( CCTO ) , an industry group , and the state_attorney general ' s office -- talks that followed years of aborted efforts to give travelers legal protection from business failures and fly-by-night operators . Industry authorities have estimated that travel scams cost consumers nationwide $ 12 billion a year , and state officials say 30 California-based travel businesses and 144 others nationwide have declared bankruptcy or ceased operation between January , 1986 , and May of this year . The most notorious case in this state was the 1989 collapse of Hemphill-Harris Travel in Encino , which left hundreds of travelers stranded around the world , and cost the company ' s California customers an estimated $ 700 # 000 or more . The bill requires companies selling travel_to pay fees and register through the state_attorney general ' s office and a new nonprofit agency to be under the state ' s oversight . The companies are then assigned a registration_number that they must include in advertisements . ( Firms that advertise with false registration_numbers could face felony prosecution by the attorney general. ) Registration will be required not only of California companies , but also of out-of-state tour operators that sell to Californians , even if they don ' t advertise here . ( The law is less clear on out-of-state travel_agents ; if they make bookings using credit_cards , don ' t deposit California money into their accounts and don ' t advertise here , they may_not be required to register. ) Los Angeles travel_agency owner and attorney Susan Tanzman Kaplan ( a key player in talks who serves as president of the CCTO and vice_president and treasurer for the American Society of Travel_Agents ) offers this advice to consumers : Starting in 1996 , if a travel advertisement from a tour operator or travel_agent doesn ' t include a state registration_number , &quot; don ' t purchase from them . And be wary when you see any ( travel ) advertisement with an 800 number that doesn ' t have the registration number. &quot; California law has long required &quot; travel promoters &quot; to maintain trust_accounts or bonds to protect consumer funds , but industry officials say minimal enforcement and uncertainty over the definition of &quot; promoter &quot; made the law largely ineffectual ; state authorities acknowledge that only about 300 businesses were registered . Past industry efforts at protection funds have yielded mixed results . The U.S. Tour Operators Assn. , which includes three dozen of the largest companies in the business , runs a similar program , requiring each member company to maintain a $ 1 million bond or equivalent . But last year the American Society of Travel_Agents , unsatisfied with its ability to keep its fund level high to cover the cost of a major failure , moved to discontinue a similar program among its members . Architects of the new law say they expect to register 8 # 000 companies , assessing them a $ 200 fee to start the restitution fund , a $ 25 fee to cover administrative costs and a $ 100 annual registration fee . In following years , annual assessments of $ 100 will be used to replenish the fund . If it becomes necessary , travel sellers could be assessed up_to $ 200 more in a year in_order to keep the fund balance above $ 1.2 million . The $ 25 start-up administrative fee may become an annual assessment . The bill also includes a sunset clause that requires reauthorization by the governor and Legislature before the end of 1998 . The statewide assessments are based on the number of locations maintained by a travel seller ; hence a mom-and-pop travel_agency will owe $ 325 next year , and American Express Travel Services , with more_than 70 retail offices statewide , will owe $ 325 for each location.
