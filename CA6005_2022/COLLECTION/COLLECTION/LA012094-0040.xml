   <HEADLINE> NO MAJOR DAMAGE , BUT QUAKE DEFINITELY LEFT ITS MARK ; AFTERMATH : ABOUT 120 PASADENA RESIDENTS ARE FORCED FROM THEIR APARTMENT COMPLEX . ONE HEART_ATTACK DEATH IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE TEMBLOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The San Gabriel Valley rode_out Monday ' s 6.6-magnitude earthquake with one death attributed to the temblor and no major damage to buildings , water_mains or power_lines . The valley was spared severe damage because the earthquake ' s ground motion moved primarily north-south rather than east-west , said Caltech spokeswoman Heather Lovasz . The earthquake faults believed to be involved generally run north-south . An 84-year-old Monterey Park man suffered a heart_attack and died shortly after the quake struck at 4:31 a.m. , Police Lt . Maynard Merkt said . The man ' s name was not released . Meanwhile , falling bricks forced about 120 residents from their Pasadena apartment complex into Red_Cross shelters . Pasadena building inspectors condemned the apartments at Villa Street and Marengo Avenue early Monday after bricks from the top stories tumbled into the parking_area bordering the three buildings , City Councilman Bill Crowfoot said . The councilman spent Monday morning translating directions to the Red_Cross shelter in Victory Park to the mostly Spanish-speaking residents of the apartments . They were not expected to be allowed back in the building until late this week at the earliest . The effects of the quake were visible as residents carted_off their belongings in garbage bags and babies cried in their mothers ' arms . Resident Carmen Dill , 24 , a nurse , said she and her husband were going_to stay with her parents in Altadena . &quot; These people are being uprooted , it ' s very traumatic . Many don ' t speak English , and they ' re definitely going_to need some counseling to get_through this , &quot; said Health Department program coordinator Joe Huerta as he helped Crowfoot translate . Forty-one residents without relatives in the area spent the night at a second shelter set_up at the Jackie Robinson Center after a free El Pollo Loco dinner at Victory Park , said Deane Winant of the Red_Cross . An additional 20 people arrived_at the shelter from Altadena and the Northridge area . Hundreds of additional buildings in the valley ' s 29 other cities will also require repair . Almost all police_departments reported numerous calls_for help in dealing with shattered windows and fallen brick facades caused by the quake and its aftershocks . Roughly 40 buildings were damaged in Pasadena , 18 of them in the Old Town area . Some businesses also suffered merchandise loss . For instance , about $ 3 # 000 worth of damage was reported at the Crate and Barrel store in Old Pasadena after the shaking toppled glass merchandise from shelves , and owners of the Dodsworth bar estimated broken liquor bottles would cost them thousands of dollars . The San Gabriel Mission , newly reopened after undergoing $ 1.2 million in repairs from the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake , survived the latest temblor intact , but tremors shifted its tower about an inch and damaged its museum , officials said . Pasadena ' s Colorado Bridge , also recently reopened after seismic retrofitting , weathered the shaking with no problems . Broken water_mains were reported in South Pasadena and Monterey Park , among other cities , but officials said the water_supply for the Valley remains pure and all tap_water is safe and drinkable . An estimated $ 10 # 000 worth of water damage was reported at The Plaza in West Covina when some 50 gallons of water sprayed out of a broken sprinkler head and damaged four stores , mall officials said . A number of brief power_failures caused lights to go_out all_over the valley in the wake of the quake , but electricity was quickly restored , according to Southern California Edison . El Monte suffered an hourlong blackout , and power was cut_off to parts of Temple City , Azusa and Arcadia as well . Downed power_lines at a Vons grocery_store at 10150 Lower Azusa Road in El Monte burned two unoccupied cars . The brief outages also caused many traffic_signals to start blinking red valleywide , and a security_guard was trapped in an elevator for about 90 minutes at Alhambra Hospital , said hospital security supervisor Scott Johnson . &quot; ( Officer Rudy Patron ) got stuck between the third and fourth floors right after it hit , &quot; said Johnson , who cracked jokes to Patron over a walkie-talkie while engineers and firefighters slowly lowered the car into the basement and pried open the doors . Patron , 44 , is a Vietnam veteran who said he ' s been through much worse than being trapped in an elevator . &quot; But right now , I ' m taking the stairs , &quot; he added with a laugh . &quot; I ' ve had enough of elevators for a_couple_of days. &quot; Other hospitals across the valley reported mostly minor injuries due_to the shaking . &quot; We ' ve only gotten cuts and scrapes , which is great , &quot; said Steve Willis of Huntington Memorial Hospital . Dozens of nurses , doctors , police and firefighters from San Gabriel also traveled_to San Fernando to aid quake victims , and Huntington has taken_in babies needing intensive care from hospitals in the Northridge area . Robert Person , Pasadena ' s assistant to the city_manager , said the city hopes to have the 41 apartment residents who have no place to stay relocated to new apartments by Friday . After an Earthquake There ' s little doubt about it : Feeling the ground move can grip us in fear the way little else can . The psychiatric and social_services staffs at Las Encinas Hospital in Pasadena offer the following advice for the worry that may come_in the weeks that follow : * Find a way to seize some control . For example , pick_up items that shook loose during the quake as soon as possible . * Develop and practice a family disaster preparedness plan . Every family member should participate . * Keep_up with the news . Staying informed is critical . * Discuss your feelings with family , friends or other helpful people . * Slow down and think_about your actions . Do not overreact ; panic is contagious . When dealing with_children : * Calmly explain the situation . Children take their cues from you . * Include your children in developing a plan to deal with the aftershocks . * Encourage your children to discuss their feelings . Listen to their fears and do not try to make light of them . * Keep your children occupied by playing or talking with them . They need you for comfort . * Do not hide your feelings . Let them know how you feel . Las Encinas Hospital is sponsoring a free counseling hotline for people suffering from post-quake anxiety : ( 800 ) 4-HELP-44 .</TEXT>
