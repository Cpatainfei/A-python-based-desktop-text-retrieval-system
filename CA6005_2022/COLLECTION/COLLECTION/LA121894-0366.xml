   <HEADLINE> CHRISTMAS_EVE IN BRUCULINU ; AN OILY CHRISTMAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The traditional Sicilian Christmas_Eve dinner is fried for a variety of reasons . First , ovens were owned municipally , or by the rich ; and , in any case , roasting is inappropriate for the feast ' s food , as prescribed by the Church . More importantly , Sicilians take great pride and pleasure in showing abundance at the table , especially at holidays . At Christmas time , this abundance manifests itself in the use of olive_oil , which has been one of the island ' s main crops since the Greek conquest and colonization in the 8th Century B.C. As the holiday falls not long after the annual olive harvest , the extravagant use of the precious oil is possible . The most important reason , however , is taste . There is no other cooking method that can turn something as commonplace as cauliflower into something splendid . By virtue of extreme heat , the process sears the outer surface of the food , locking_in its flavor . As long as the oil is hot enough , and its structure has not been broken_down by excessive re-use , the fried food will not be greasy . Along the same lines , the use of extra-virgin olive_oil is important . Though it has a lower smoking temperature than many other oils -- and , therefore , must be treated with care -- the flavor is not to be missed . Of course , for deep-frying , you need not use the precious Tuscan oils that come_in perfume bottles . Find a moderately priced , good quality extra-virgin oil , such_as Fior d ' Oliva or Antica Italia , and buy a large can . The flavor of properly fried food is festive in its tone , rich and subtle in its aspect and connected to the ages in its style . * To fry artichokes : Set_up a bowl of water with the juice and zest of one of lemon . Pass a knife through another lemon prior to each cut_to prevent the artichoke from turning black . Cut_off 1 / 2 inch from the top of the artichoke . Peel away the outer leaves to the place at which the leaves are pale green and thinner . Cut_off the stem , cut the artichoke in half , and place in the bowl of lemon and water . This seems like a monumental task , but after the first few , it moves along very quickly . Add the juice and zest of the second lemon to the bowl and let the artichokes soak 15 minutes . Place a pot of water on the stove with the juice of two lemons and their zests . When the water boils , add the drained artichokes , cover , and cook for 10 minutes . Run under cold water to stop the cooking process . Drain the artichokes thoroughly and pat dry . Pass the artichokes through flour , egg and bread crumbs . Then deep fry in the same way as the potato croquettes . They can be fried in the same pot of olive_oil , after the croquettes have been completed . * To fry cardoons : Carduna , also called_in Italian cardi or cardone , is a stalk-like vegetable with the texture of celery and the flavor of artichoke . To cook cardoons , first peel_off the strings and cut the stalks in 1-inch lengths . Blanch them in boiling water acidulated with lemon_juice for five minutes . Drain and , when cooled , pat dry . Pass the pieces through beaten egg and dust with flour . Pan-fry in extra-virgin olive_oil until a rich , golden brown . Drain on brown paper . Serve with salt to taste . * To fry cauliflower : Cut_away and discard the stalk end and the green leaves . Cut the cauliflower in half and cut the florets away from the inner core . Soak the florets in cold salted water 15 minutes . Meanwhile , place a steamer on the stove with several scrapes of nutmeg in the steaming water . When it comes_to boil , drain the cauliflower and cook in the covered steamer 10 minutes . Run under cold water to stop the cooking process . Drain the florets thoroughly . Pat dry . Coat with beaten egg and then flour . Heat about an inch of extra-virgin olive_oil in a skillet . Pan fry the cauliflower quickly at high heat until a light golden color . Drain on brown paper and serve . * To fry fish : I have named several fishes in my article that are difficult to find in Southern California . If you are fortunate enough to find fresh sardines , be sure they are_well gutted and scaled before cooking . Dust the fish in fine bread crumbs or flour , and fry in hot extra-virgin olive_oil . Serve with salt and lemon . The taste is sublime . Whole small red_mullet is an acceptable substitute , but be aware of the many tiny bones . Tiny smelts prepared whole in the same manner are quite excellent and plentiful here . I do not recommend the use of blowfish fillets unless you are familiar_with cleaning them . This fish has a poison sack that , if not properly removed , will cause grave illness , or worse , when the fish is eaten . In addition to sole , our markets are filled with fish_fillets excellent for frying : red_snapper , orange roughy and thinly sliced shark , to name but a_few . Merely dust the shark in flour , but coat all_the others in the traditional flour , egg and bread crumbs . Fry the fish in about an inch of extra-virgin olive_oil at high heat . Drain on brown paper . Serve with lemon and salt to taste . POTATO CROQUETTES ( Cazziddi ) 2 pounds boiling potatoes 8 anchovies , chopped 4 eggs 1 cup grated Locatelli or imported Pecorino cheese Pepper Flour Bread crumbs Olive_oil for deep frying , to equal about 2 quarts Sea salt Peel and cut potatoes as for potato_salad . In pot boil in lightly salted water until cooked but quite firm . Drain potatoes and begin to mash . Add anchovies while potatoes are still very hot so anchovies will melt . Continue mashing . Add 2 eggs , cheese and season to taste with pepper . When potato mixture is_well cooled , begin to form croquettes . Line work_surface with wax_paper . Beat remaining 2 eggs in shallow bowl . In another shallow bowl , place bread crumbs . With floured hands , form small handful of potato mixture into cylinder 1 1 / 2 inches thick and 3 inches long . Carefully roll croquette in flour . Place on wax_paper . When all croquettes are formed and floured , roll 1 at time in egg , then bread crumbs , returning to wax_paper . Heat oil in 3 1 / 2-quart pot to 350 degrees , temperature at which small square of bread will brown quickly but not burn . Gently slip_in croquettes , few at time . When croquettes are rich brown , remove from oil . Drain on brown paper . Croquettes can be kept warm in 300-degree oven , uncovered , until ready to be served . Season to taste with salt . Arrange in pyramid style on platter . Makes 16 croquettes . Each croquette contains about : 117 calories ; 235 mg sodium ; 60 mg cholesterol ; 4 grams fat ; 13 grams carbohydrates ; 6 grams protein ; 0.25 gram fiber . VINCENT SCHIAVELLI</TEXT>
