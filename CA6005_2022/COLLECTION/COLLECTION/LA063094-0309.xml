   <HEADLINE> CUPPA WOE ; BRAZIL COFFEE CROP LOSSES ARE TALLIED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brazilian growers are surveying the fields , manufacturers are burning_up telephone_lines and government officials have been meeting nonstop , all_in an effort to minimize the damage of a three-day cold_snap that wiped_out at least 40 % of next year ' s coffee crop . The official numbers aren ' t in yet , but preliminary reports are dismal at best . Virtually the entire harvest in Parana , one of three primary coffee-growing states , has been lost . Another 40 % was destroyed in Sao Paulo State , and about 25 % of the crop was lost in Minas Gerais , the nation ' s largest coffee-growing region . The devastation has pushed raw U.S. coffee prices to their highest levels since 1986 , sending retail prices upward . Kraft General Foods told grocery customers it will boost prices about 15 % on its Maxwell House brand . A 13-ounce can of Maxwell House will cost $ 2.74 , up 35 cents . Procter &amp; Gamble said it will raise the price on a 13-ounce can of Folgers instant coffee by 40 cents . Steve Ruiz , coffee buyer for Los Angeles-based F . Gavina &amp; Sons , said the roaster has already raised prices to its customers , which include wholesalers and supermarkets . &quot; We ' re taking it slow . We ' re really not sure where it will settle , &quot; Ruiz said . Coffee roasters who didn ' t immediately follow their lead , including giant Nestle , said they were watching the market closely . &quot; It ' s very clear that prices are going higher and that consumers will have to pay more for coffee . But how much more and when is hard to say , &quot; said Mary Townsend , a coffee buyer at Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co . The frost is the second jolt to the coffee market in recent months . In May , raw coffee prices rose due_to shortages in Colombia , the world ' s No . 2 coffee producer , where disease wiped_out much of the crop . For Brazil , the world ' s largest coffee producer , it is the biggest crop loss in 19 years , and it could get_worse . Luis Cavalcante , chief meteorologist for the national weather service , said a second cold_front is expected to send temperatures plummeting below zero early next week in the already-ravaged areas . Members of the National Coffee Council , an organization of 68 of the biggest coffee-growing collectives , were scheduled to meet in Sao Paulo today to piece together a strategy to deal with their losses . Much will depend_on the government ' s willingness and ability to release the 17 million bags of coffee it has_on reserve in 46 warehouses in three southern states . National manufacturers want to use much of the reserve to keep the nation ' s consumer prices relatively low . &quot; We don ' t want the prices to shoot_up to the roof , &quot; said Luis Roberto Gonsolvaes , export manager for Cafe do Ponto , Brazil ' s second-largest coffee manufacturer . &quot; It will depend_on if the government uses the reserves. &quot; In monthly auctions , the government has been selling part of its reserves in 132-pound bags to manufacturers at below-market prices . This month , the government nearly doubled the amount available for_sale by adding 200 # 000 bags to the load . But the government is limited by congressional mandate to sell only 2.8 million bags this year , far below what will be needed to stave_off high prices . Meanwhile , exporters want part of the reserves so they can take_advantage of the world market ' s higher coffee prices . Even if the government releases all_of its exportable coffee , however , the effect will be minimal , says Francisco Orique of Flavour Coffee , a trading company . Only 3 million of the bags the government currently holds_in reserve are of exportable quality . &quot; Brazil normally produces about 31 million bags of coffee , &quot; he said . &quot; We have lost between 6 and 10 million bags . There ' s going_to be a huge deficit. &quot; The freeze couldn ' t have come at a worse time for Brazil . After a four-year price slump that began in 1989 with the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement , coffee prices had begun to soar this year due_to lower worldwide harvests . As recently as last July , the average world price of a pound of green ( unroasted ) beans stood at 52 cents . By last month , it had jumped to $ 1.28 a pound . Brazil was poised for an estimated $ 3.5 billion on next year ' s sales after years of averaging about $ 1.5 billion in coffee exports . &quot; But now , even though coffee prices are high , we will come_to the market with less to sell , &quot; said Hercilio Amaral , general secretary of the National Coffee Council . The result , he said , is that Brazil could miss out on as much as $ 1 billion in exports . The question now is how the world ' s eighth-largest economy -- in particular the 7.5 million workers who depend_on coffee production and export for their livelihood -- will be affected . If the government can work_out a process for releasing the reserves , manufacturers say , plants will keep running and workers will keep their jobs . For those in the field , the cold_snap could actually provide a small jump in employment . While growers won ' t be able to harvest the more_than 20 million plants damaged or destroyed by the frost , they will need even more workers to plant new crops and trim the plants that were damaged . For Brazilians , who consume a third of the coffee the country produces , the freeze is -- at least symbolically -- a particularly sour note just days before the country is to embark_on an economic program to halt spiraling inflation . The real , a new currency that will be pegged to the dollar , is to be introduced Friday in the hope that it will dramatically lower inflation , which last month was nearly 50 % . The freeze is &quot; another thing that will have a negative impact on the country , &quot; said Denise Cardosa Da Silva , an unemployed schoolteacher . * Staff writer Denise Gellene in Los Angeles contributed to this report .
