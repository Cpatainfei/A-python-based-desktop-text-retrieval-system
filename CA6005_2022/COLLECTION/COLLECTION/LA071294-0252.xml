   <HEADLINE> 2 FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS ELECT RUSSIA BACKERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Voters in Ukraine and Belarus , whose leaders conspired to break_up the Soviet_Union 2 1 / 2 years ago , have elected presidents favoring closer ties with Russia , official returns showed Monday . The turnabout is expected to give Moscow greater sway over its old empire . Leonid Kuchma , a 55-year-old former missile factory director who campaigned against a &quot; suicidal course of isolation from Russia , &quot; won 52 % of the vote to upset President Leonid Kravchuk in a close contest in Ukraine , one of the most stubbornly independent former Soviet republics . Alexander Lukashenko , 39 , an obscure onetime collective_farm director , ran a crudely populist campaign to become Belarus ' first president , defeating Prime_Minister Vyacheslav Kebich by a landslide in a race between two advocates of monetary union with Russia . Both winners in Sunday ' s runoffs often spoke Russian on the campaign trail , urging angry voters to dump incumbents whom they blamed for undermining the ideals of independence by running corrupt administrations and stagnant , un-reforming economies . Officials in Moscow -- joined by a host of politicians from former Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev to ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky -- welcomed the outcomes . They predicted a tighter alliance among the three Slavic nations at the core of the former union . &quot; I doubt that the Soviet_Union will ever be restored , but I am sure the republics are getting closer to a confederation of some kind , &quot; said Sergei B . Stankevich , a member of the Russian Parliament ' s foreign affairs committee . Russian Economics Minister Alexander N . Shokhin said the Kremlin will seek early meetings with both new presidents . In the case of Ukraine , he said , Russia is eager to discuss &quot; which of our old pains can be rapidly cured. &quot; The emerging ties will be closely watched by the West , which has often fretted over Russia ' s neo-imperialist ambitions as a potential source of violent conflict with its smaller neighbors . Ukrainian nationalists warned that their country , which voted sharply along regional and ethnic lines , could split apart if Kuchma moves too close to Russia . Kuchma ' s victory also worries the West because he favors re-examining Ukraine ' s commitment to ship to Russia the nuclear_weapons it inherited from the Soviet_Union . While supporting eventual disarmament , Kuchma said in the campaign that Ukraine is getting too_little money from the West in return . Apparently hoping to help Kravchuk , President Clinton and other leaders of the seven leading industrialized nations meeting in Naples , Italy , announced on election eve a $ 4.2-million aid package for Ukraine . But Kuchma rode to victory on a wave of economic discontent in the eastern and southern Ukrainian provinces where ethnic Russians are a majority . He won 90 % of the vote_in the disputed Black_Sea peninsula of Crimea and 79 % in the coal-mining district of Donetsk . &quot; Ukraine is 80 % dependent_on the raw_materials of Russia , &quot; Kuchma said in a televised debate last week . &quot; This is oil , this is lumber . Even beyond our 1 # 000-year shared history , we are obliged to our great neighbor. &quot; Kravchuk , who quarreled repeatedly with Moscow and portrayed the challenger as a traitor who might give_up sovereignty , got as much as 96 % of the vote_in some regions of the nationalist western half of the country , which was Sovietized only after World_War_II . It was Kravchuk and Belarus leader Stanislav Shushkevich who met with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin in December , 1991 , to declare independence from a dying Soviet_Union and set_up the loose , ineffectual Commonwealth of Independent States . In the past two years , Yeltsin has reasserted Russia ' s hegemony over its neighbors , sending troops to intervene in ethnic conflicts and posting border guards along most of the perimeter of the former Soviet_Union . Moscow has also pressed other republics for more favorable trade conditions by threatening to withhold oil and gas supplies . Faced with higher inflation and weaker currencies than in Russia , voters in energy-poor Belarus and Ukraine opted for closer banking and trade ties with Moscow rather than strong free-market reforms at_home . Neither Lukashenko nor Kuchma , who was ineffective as Kravchuk ' s prime_minister for 11 months , offered a detailed economic plan . Last April , Belarus ' Kebich negotiated a treaty with Russia that would abolish the local currency and adopt the Russian ruble . Shushkevich , the independence leader who was ousted last January as Speaker of Parliament , opposed the treaty and finished a distant fourth in first-round voting June 23 . Lukashenko , a fiery anti-corruption crusader who threatened to expel crooked officials to the Himalayas with no time to pack , won 80 % of the runoff vote -- a huge protest against the political Establishment . Kebich , who became prime_minister in 1990 , polled 14 % . Russian officials made no secret of their preference for Kebich but were pleased that Lukashenko gave general endorsement to the currency treaty , which has not been implemented . In Ukraine , Kuchma has called_for settling a potentially violent dispute over the Black_Sea naval fleet by leasing Russia not only a share of its warships but also the Crimean port of Sevastopol , a prize that Kravchuk has refused in endless negotiations to give_up . Times special correspondent Mary Mycio in Kiev and Sergei Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .
