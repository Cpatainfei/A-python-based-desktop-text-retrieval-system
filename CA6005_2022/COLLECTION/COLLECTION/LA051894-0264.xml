   <HEADLINE> HISTORY ; NAZI-HUNTERS FEAR TRANSFER OF DOCUMENT CENTER ' S CONTROL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A prominent German physician had just been elected president of the World Medical Assn . when researchers probing his past discovered one noteworthy association omitted from his resume . Hans Joachim Sewering had been a Nazi and a member of the dreaded SS during World_War_II . Records indicated that he signed an order in 1943 sending a retarded girl to her death as part of Hitler ' s euthanasia program . Sewering denied knowing the girl would be killed , but an international outcry forced him to resign as president-elect of the prestigious group last year after the World Jewish Congress revealed his wartime history . This dark page from Sewering ' s past was uncovered by WJC investigators using records at the Berlin Documents Center , a repository of Nazi personnel records that for nearly 50 years has been a treasure_trove of information for scholars and Nazi hunters . Now , however , researchers fear that the virtually unlimited access they have had to the American-run center is about to be curtailed under terms of an agreement returning custody of the files to Germany on July 1 . While the agreement guarantees U.S. officials will continue to have access to the files , Jewish organizations and other independent researchers are concerned that Germany ' s strict privacy laws will deny them similar entree . State_Department officials say these fears are unfounded because the accord stipulates that the transfer will take_place only after a microfilm copy of all documents in the BDC files has been turned_over to the United States . The microfilm -- 40 # 000 rolls of it -- will be housed at the National Archives , where it will be accessible as soon as user copies are made from the master film . Far from restricting access , the agreement ultimately should make the documents more accessible &quot; by providing the means to use them to Americans who lack the luxury of a research budget to travel_to Berlin , &quot; noted Mary Ann Peters , deputy assistant secretary_of_state for European affairs . But WJC Executive_Director Elan Steinberg and others who oppose the transfer to German control note that it will take the National Archives at least two years to generate a complete set of user copies of the more_than 75 million pages of documents . They worry about the access that private researchers will have to the originals in the meantime . Airing their concerns at a recent congressional hearing , two prominent scholars noted that historians frequently have had trouble gaining access to wartime documents under German control . &quot; Access is often granted or denied in a completely arbitrary fashion , &quot; said Henry Friedlander , a professor of history at City_University of New York . While some German archivists are helpful , others can be &quot; downright obstructionist , &quot; added Geoffrey J . Giles , a University of Florida historian . &quot; Archivists have lied_about the existence of files , they have flatly refused to let scholars use them and occasionally they have even burnt Nazi files , &quot; Giles told the House Foreign Affairs ' subcommittee on human_rights . Peters said that while State_Department officials do not expect that access to the documents will become a problem , the head of the U.S. consulate in Berlin would intercede on behalf of researchers if difficulties do arise . Chairman Tom Lantos ( D-Burlingame ) and other subcommittee members appear unconvinced . &quot; We are giving_up something over which we now have control on the assumption of continued goodwill and cooperation ( from Germany ) . . . but it is no more_than an assumption , &quot; he said . While Lantos has threatened to introduce legislation to stop the transfer , congressional sources predicted that the issue will be resolved in the coming weeks with a protocol guaranteeing researchers access to the original documents until the microfilmed copies are available at the National Archives .</TEXT>
