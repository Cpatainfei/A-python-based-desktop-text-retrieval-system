   <TEXT> THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF GHOSTS AND SPIRITS by John and Anne Spencer ( Trafalgar Square : $ 39.95 ; 416 pp. ) President Coolidge ' s wife saw Abraham_Lincoln in the Oval Office.So did visiting Queen Wilhelmina . His funeral train annually passes_through Albany , the local newspaper reports . Goethe saw himself eight years in the future . Dylan Thomas throws stones at the Old Boat House in Wales . An entire Paris street scene appears regularly in Haiti . A motorist killed in a tunnel collapse in Italy ' s South Tyrol still tools about in his gray Audi . A poltergeist pours water on a just-completed tax_form . ( Try that on the IRS. ) Some of the above are authenticated ; most are not . It ' s the not that draws you into the book . The somewhat stodgy tone , the skepticism , the disclaimers of John and Anne Spencer lend credence to what they have found to be valid . One report on ghosts is &quot; good drama but far too neatly tied up. &quot; In another it is &quot; difficult to separate reality and legend. &quot; An entire chapter is &quot; likely to contain no genuine ghosts. &quot; As a matter_of_fact , they write , 98 % of reports of &quot; haunting &quot; can be attributed to &quot; something quite mundane. &quot; Ah , but the 2 % ! Whatever your prepossession , the encyclopedia is a compelling guide to dopplegangers and vardogers , presences and poltergeists , &quot; omens of death &quot; and &quot; time slips &quot; ( who is out of time ? us or the ghosts ? ) and even provides a list of ghost-hunting equipment . Don ' t forget batteries ! In at least one instance , a revenant agreed to be photographed . Alas , &quot; The spirit was willing but the flash was weak. &quot;</TEXT>
