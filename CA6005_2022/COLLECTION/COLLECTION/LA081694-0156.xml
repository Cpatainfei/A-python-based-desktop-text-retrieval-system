   <HEADLINE> INDIA , PAKISTAN EXCHANGE HARSH WORDS ON KASHMIR ; ASIA : AT SEPARATE INDEPENDENCE CEREMONIES , LEADERS GIVE LITTLE SIGN OF COMPROMISE ON TERRITORIAL DISPUTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> India and Pakistan entered their 48th year of independence this week by exchanging harsh , in-your-face remarks over Kashmir , showing yet again how acrimonious their relations remain after nearly half a century as unhappy neighbors . &quot; With you , without you , in spite of you , Kashmir will remain an integral part of India , &quot; Prime_Minister P . V . Narasimha Rao , vowed Monday in a no-nonsense message directed at Pakistan . In his Independence_Day address , which will be scrutinized for clues about India ' s foreign and domestic policy agenda , Rao insisted that Pakistan quit the one-third of the disputed former Himalayan princely state that it has seized and held . &quot; The one unfinished task is that Pakistan vacate its occupation of those areas of Kashmir which are under its control and should form part of India , &quot; he declared . The Indian leader mischievously borrowed terms used by Pakistani Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto , who on Sunday termed the territorial dispute over Kashmir &quot; the unfinished agenda of the 1947 partition plan &quot; that dismembered British-ruled India into two new states , mostly Hindu India and predominantly Muslim Pakistan . &quot; I want to make_it clear to the government of India , &quot; Bhutto said , &quot; that Pakistan would not come under any Indian pressure and continue to apprise the international community of ongoing human_rights violations and atrocities being committed by Indian forces against the innocent people of Kashmir. &quot; Bhutto , speaking at a flag-raising ceremony in Islamabad marking the anniversary of Pakistan ' s creation , said her country would always support Kashmiris fighting Indian rule . Since independence and the blood bath of partition , in which an estimated 15 million people were uprooted and 200 # 000 died , India and Pakistan have fought three wars , two over possession of Kashmir . The territory had been the realm of a Hindu maharajah and playboy who opted at the last minute to join India , although most of his subjects were Muslims . Today , the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir , India ' s only state with a Muslim majority , is home to the most widespread separatist struggle faced by the New Delhi government . Pakistan wants the Kashmiris to be allowed to choose between India and Pakistan in an internationally organized plebiscite . Rao has ruled that out , though on Monday , apparently for the first time , he said &quot; we are progressing towards elections &quot; in Kashmir . He gave no dates . The tenor of his speech left no doubt that the elections will be a purely Indian affair . Citing Bhutto ' s remarks the previous day , Rao said it was crystal_clear , despite Islamabad ' s official denials , that Pakistan is arming and aiding &quot; terrorists &quot; battling Indian rule_in Kashmir . By some estimates , 17 # 000 people have died in the uprising that began four years ago . The unrest continued right through the Independence_Day holiday . As Jammu and Kashmir Gov . K . V . Krishna Rao unfurled the Indian tricolor and made a speech Monday morning , Muslim militants fired a rocket aimed at the Srinagar stadium where the ceremonies were taking_place , a report quoting official sources said . The rocket fell about 400 yards short and exploded in a residential compound , killing one man and seriously wounding another . Domestic and international human_rights groups accuse the Indian army and police of waging a brutal campaign of repression to snuff_out the Kashmiri rebellion . Despite Bhutto ' s tough talk the previous day , Rao said Monday , &quot; we want to tell Pakistan that we will continue to take steps to stop terrorist activities in Kashmir. &quot; But by talking_of elections , Rao was tacitly extending an invitation to more moderate Kashmiri groups to forsake armed struggle and get involved in the electoral process .</TEXT>
