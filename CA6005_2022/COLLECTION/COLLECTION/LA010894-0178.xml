   <HEADLINE> GREAT COVER-UPS : UNRAVELING THE MYSTERIES OF HOUSEHOLD_LINENS ; WRAP_UP LASTING LUXURY WITH SMART SHOPPING AND CARE OF SHEETS , DOWN COMFORTERS , TOWELS AND TABLECLOTHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Given that sheets , tablecloths , and towels are part of every household , one would think that buying and caring_for these familiar items would be a snap . Not so . The large array of linens available is staggering and can be confusing . Is it better to buy Egyptian_cotton sheets or cotton percale ? How high should the loop on a towel be for maximum absorption ? And just how long should a tablecloth drop over the side of a table ? The differences in the types of bedding , dining and bath_linens are not just a matter of style , but of quality and price . At the top end , the highest_quality -- and priced -- linens are imported from Europe . Coveted for the use of natural_fibers and fine workmanship , linens from Italy , France and Germany have a reputation for being the best . But their cost is often prohibitive to the person in need of everyday sheets , towels and table coverings . Linens made in this country -- usually from domestically grown cotton -- may_not be as luxurious as top-line imports , but there are linens that come_close and at a fraction of the price . January is traditionally a good time to shop for linens because so many retailers have white_sales . But with all_the choices , it can be difficult to decide what to purchase . Here are some of the basics about linens : SHEETS Only in the past few decades have sheets become available that are wrinkle resistant and so don ' t need ironing . Because of improved cotton_strains and weaving techniques , as well as chemical treatments , most sheets rarely need pressing . But with the new technology came a little less comfort , according to the pros . Many sheet manufacturers use formaldehyde and other chemicals to treat the sheets and make them wrinkle-free . &quot; You can really smell it when you take them out of the package , &quot; said Sandra Tobin Marx , owner of Between the Sheets in Newport Beach . Her shop only carries European-made linens that have not been treated with chemicals . &quot; People buy our sheets because they are softer and more comfortable , and they ' re not laying their faces on fabric soaked in formaldehyde. &quot; The trade-off for softer sheets without wrinkle-free treatments is that they must be ironed or professionally laundered . There is also an enormous difference in price . Thread count and cotton type are the criteria used to price sheets . Thread count refers to how many cotton threads per inch are used to weave the fabric . The more threads , the softer and smoother the sheet . Muslin comes_in at a 160-thread count ; at 180 the fabric is called percale , standard now for sheets . &quot; We don ' t even carry muslin sheets anymore because percale can be made so cheaply now that you can buy percale at muslin prices , &quot; said Gino Fabbricatore , Orange County district_manager for Mervyn ' s . The same is true for sheets made of cotton / polyester blends . Although there are still discount shops that sell them , the price for 100 % cotton sheets has come_down so_much in the past decade that there is little savings in buying blends . &quot; Cotton breathes better and is softer than a blend . And with the price only a dollar or two more , people buy the cotton sheets , &quot; said Wade Mathieson , assistant manager of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond , a national chain of discount retail_stores with a location in Huntington Beach . &quot; Everything now is percale and permanent_press , until you get_into the top end. &quot; Sheets considered top-end have anywhere from a 200- to 600-thread count and will be made of either Pima or Egyptian_cotton . Egyptian_cotton is considered the best . Originally from Egypt , it is now grown mainly in Europe . It is the longest of cotton fibers and the strongest . Pima and supima are cottons grown in Arizona and are considered second only to Egyptian_cotton . European-made bed_linens are considered superior because of the complex weaving process used to make the sheet , according to Tobin Marx . &quot; It ' s a much slower weave , and the Egyptian_cotton makes a finer thread , so you have a sheet that almost feels_like silk . American cotton does not have the same long , stable yarns , and so , even though you can get a 300-count Pima cotton sheet , it ' s just not the same animal. &quot; Cost is also considerably different between Pima and Egyptian_cotton sheets . A king size Pima sheet will run about $ 85 ; one made from Egyptian_cotton can cost anywhere from $ 150 to $ 300 . But the cost is not keeping some from buying the more expensive sheets . &quot; People are becoming more demanding ( of ) their bed_linens , &quot; Mathieson said . &quot; I think it has a bit to do with the recession . Instead of going_to France or wherever , they are staying_at home and putting more money into their surroundings . &quot; We now carry supima cotton sheets at 300 count ; 18 months ago the top we carried was 280 count. &quot; Sheets made from these more expensive cottons are said to last longer than percale if they are cared_for properly . If they are not professionally laundered , care must be used not to wash them in too harsh a detergent or to dry them in too hot a dryer . &quot; Most ( laundry ) products off the shelf will eventually cause fibers to disintegrate , &quot; said Jeannette Tromanhauser , co-owner of La Belle Maison in Santa Ana . &quot; We recommend Planet and never ( using ) chlorine , which also eats_away at fibers . Borateem or Snowy bleach can be used , because they whiten without the sheet having to soak too long. &quot; Tobin Marx also recommends Cheer , which carries the approval of the American Cotton Council . &quot; Never boil the sheets . A warm cycle is sufficient to clean them . And don ' t dry them until you can smell the fibers burning. &quot; DOWN COMFORTERS &quot; Down is probably the most misunderstood product on the market , &quot; Tobin Marx said . &quot; In America you ' re allowed to call a comforter 100 % down when it has 70 % down and 30 % can be feathers , including the quill and shaft. &quot; Feathers weigh more_than down -- the term for the fine , insulating bird feathers -- and are more rigid . &quot; They make a comforter pokey and heavy . So when people compare down comforters by weight , they must look_at the amount of down that is in it , not the total weight , &quot; Tobin Marx said . Down is coveted for its lightness and heat retaining properties . Birds use their down feathers to insulate against the cold by fluffing them up and trapping air between their bodies and the down . Their bodies heat the air , thus forming a barrier to cold . A down comforter works in the same way : the greater the percentage of down feathers , the lighter the comforter and the better its insulating capabilities . There is no way to get a comforter made from 100 % down unless your grandmother is sitting at the kitchen_table sorting the feathers . But a top quality , commercially made comforter will have only 5 % of its weight from feathers other_than down . Construction is also important , because down needs to be able to trap air . A comforter using baffled-box construction is considered the most efficient and is the most expensive . In this style , thin mesh runs_along all edges , allowing air to flow through the comforter . Less efficient and less costly is channel construction , which constricts air flow into channels instead of letting it circulate throughout the comforter . The type of down used is also important . Down imported from China is cheaper and has less insulating power . &quot; Hungarian or Polish goose down is the best because the weather is colder and the geese are bigger and need down feathers with a lot of loft , &quot; Tobin Marx said . Loft is the feathers ' ability to fluff_up and trap air . It ' s the same reason down comforters can be compressed and still bounce_back to their original size . &quot; With a good comforter you don ' t have the oppressive weight of blankets , and you can leave it on 52 weeks a year , &quot; Tobin Marx said . Caring_for a down comforter is easy , according to Tromanhauser , as long as it is done properly . Because down cannot be washed , a cover should always be used on the comforter to protect it . It is also a good idea to shake out the comforter every day , allowing it to bounce_back from being crushed during the night . Don ' t lie on the comforter . Twice a year , hang it out_in the sunlight to allow perspiration to evaporate . &quot; Once every 10 years have it opened and sterilized . It costs only about 30 % of buying a new one , &quot; Tobin Marx said . A top quality comforter can cost more_than $ 1 # 000 but will last decades if cared_for well . TOWELS In evaluating towels , the things to consider are size , thickness and density . Towels are made of varying grades of cotton based on the length of the fiber and how it is cleaned when it is harvested . Longer fibers make_for a stronger , more durable cloth . Cotton is either carded or combed , referring to how it was cleaned when it left the field . Carded cotton is the lowest grade and makes a rougher , less absorbent towel . Combed cotton means the cotton was thoroughly gleaned of any leaves or twigs before being spun into thread . It makes a softer , more absorbent towel . Towels that are white or natural in_color are more absorbent because dyes used to color cotton are heavy and block water take-up , according to Mathieson . Top_of_the_line towels are usually made from Pima or supima cotton and are at least 27 inches wide and 57 inches long . They will also have more loops per square_inch , and the threads will be twisted , which increases absorbency . &quot; The loops are what defines terry cloth , &quot; Fabbricatore said . &quot; When the threads are twisted first , then looped , it gives more area for the water to be trapped. &quot; The more loops , the thicker the towel . Another type of towel is a velour , in which one side is terry and the other has been sheared to make_it seem velvety . The velour side is not absorbent , Fabbricatore added . A bath_towel can be purchased for as little as $ 2 , but that will be a small , less absorbent towel . Better towels will run about $ 9 , with top quality going_for $ 20 or more . Consider how a towel will be used before deciding on the quality you want . If it is going_to be hung for decoration rather than everyday use , a less absorbent , less expensive towel is probably sufficient . Towel experts offer an additional word_of_advice : Never put fabric softener in the wash cycle with your towels . It will make them less absorbent . TABLECLOTHS A true linen tablecloth is made from flax , a tall slender plant . Damask refers to a linen cloth with a Jacquard pattern that is woven into the cloth and gives it a glossy sheen . Jacquard is a type of weave similar to the brocade that Marco Polo brought_to the Western world from China in the 13th Century . The higher the texture of the Jacquard , the better the quality . But pure linen , which is expensive , is not the only fabric for tablecloths . Table_linens can be found in materials ranging from silk to polyester . Cotton is the most common and considered one of the best choices . However , permanent_press cotton is not necessarily the best choice for a tablecloth . &quot; One of the biggest problems with permanent_press is if there is a spill , it can become permanent . The chemicals used to make a cloth permanent_press also make stains harder to remove , &quot; Tobin Marx said . It is easier to remove stains from cotton and linen , and they are said to wear better than synthetic materials . &quot; People make the mistake of packing up their fine linens and only using them for special occasions . But cotton is nothing to be afraid of and should be used every day , &quot; Tobin Marx said . Never store linens in plastic as that can lead to deterioration and discoloration , she added . Before buying a tablecloth , make_sure you know the exact size of the table . If the cloth doesn ' t fit right , it will look skimpy or be a nuisance . &quot; You want it to fall anywhere from eight to 12 inches over the side , &quot; Tromanhauser said . &quot; You don ' t want it to drag_on the chair seat. &quot;</TEXT>
