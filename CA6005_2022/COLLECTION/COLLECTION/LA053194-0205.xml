   <HEADLINE> CLINTON OUTLINES PROGRAM AIMED AT HUMAN_RIGHTS IN CHINA ; ASIA : THE PRESIDENT SETS FORTH FIVE WAYS TO PUSH FOR IMPROVEMENTS . ACTION IS PART OF HIS NEW CAMPAIGN TO BETTER EXPLAIN ADMINISTRATION ' S FOREIGN_POLICY TO AMERICANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , striving to demonstrate continued American pressure to end Chinese human_rights abuses , has outlined a five-point program &quot; to support forces of constructive change in China while strengthening the U.S.-China relationship. &quot; The program , described in an article appearing today on the opinion pages of The Times , consists_of steps by the Clinton_Administration , American businesses and human_rights organizations to push China to improve human_rights conditions , even though they no longer will be linked to U.S. trade privileges . Last week , the Administration announced it would effectively end the effort to link China ' s human_rights record with its status as a most-favored-nation ( MFN ) trading partner . Clinton ' s article also clearly is part of his new campaign to do_better at explaining his foreign_policy to Americans . Clinton told The Times on Friday that controversies and apparent shortcomings in his foreign_policy were not the result of staff weaknesses but of his inability to communicate effectively about key issues and decisions . Among the most controversial of those decisions was the one he made to renew China ' s MFN status , despite Beijing ' s failure to comply fully on human_rights issues , as required by Congress and a presidential executive order last year . &quot; Annual debates linking MFN to human_rights threaten to block needed progress on security and economic issues while yielding little if any progress on human_rights , &quot; Clinton writes in the article . &quot; We must pursue our human_rights agenda with China in a way that does not isolate China . We can ' t help change human_rights in China if we ' re not there. &quot; The five points he outlines consist_of : * Transmitting new foreign broadcasts to China , including the new Radio Free Asia . * Supporting U.S. groups assisting private Chinese groups working_on human_rights issues . * Developing voluntary standards for U.S. firms doing business in or with China . * Promoting international attention to and support for human_rights in China . * Banning the import of Chinese guns and ammunition . In the context of D-day commemorations this week , the President writes : &quot; We must_not waver in the challenge of advancing those same values -- freedom and prosperity -- in Asia and especially China . It is in this region that many of the profound challenges to America ' s national interest can be found ; it is in this region that our generation ' s progress will in large part be measured. &quot; The President commends the Chinese government for recent steps , including the release of two dissidents , verbal acceptance of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human_Rights and moves toward ending the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts . But he underscores that these are insufficient to constitute real progress . He calls his program &quot; new and vigorous , &quot; although each of the individual points has been debated or acted_on before . In the 1992 presidential campaign , Clinton pledged to make improvement of China ' s human_rights record a prerequisite for renewal of its favored trading status and to launch Radio Free Asia to make available new foreign media outlets to the Chinese people . Congress passed authorization of Radio Free Asia this spring , despite China ' s vigorous opposition on grounds that it amounted to interference in its internal affairs . Establishing voluntary principles for U.S. businesses -- an idea tried with disputed impact in South_Africa -- is a longstanding option borrowed from parties who oppose using MFN as leverage on human_rights .</TEXT>
