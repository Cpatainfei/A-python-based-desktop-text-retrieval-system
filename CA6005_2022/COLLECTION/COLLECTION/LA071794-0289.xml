   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 45th Congressional District . They are Democrat Brett Williamson of Costa Mesa and Republican Dana Rohrabacher , the incumbent , of Huntington Beach . Where they stand on four issues : Health_Care Williamson : &quot; Any health_care legislation must provide_for universal coverage . ( I ) support an employer-funded program to replace the huge insurance_premiums currently being paid_out by both employers and employees alike . I will not support any plan unless it provides full coverage for those already on Medicare and for children , including immunizations and preventive care . I support managed health_care networks that allow individuals to select from multiple plans , at least one of which must give all participants the option to choose their own doctor. &quot; Rohrabacher : &quot; I support reorienting tax_benefits for health_insurance from employers to individuals for their choice of approved , universally available plans , assisting the poor as necessary . This would encourage individual choice and responsibility , which I believe is preferable to keeping employees tied to employers for the sake of their health_insurance or turning health_care over to the government . I also support tort reform , particularly in the medical area , to try to reduce the portion of medical costs which are caused by the legal_system . Unjustified and frivolous lawsuits are a major contributor to increased health costs. &quot; Education and Health_Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants Williamson : &quot; I favor reducing illegal immigration by stricter control of our borders , increasing the number of Border_Patrol agents , cracking_down on visa violators , imposing sanctions on those who knowingly hire undocumented workers . Curtailing health_care and education benefits will not solve the immigration problem. &quot; Rohrabacher : &quot; We will never get our illegal immigration problems under_control as long as we continue to offer a generous package of federal , state and local benefits to anyone in the world who can make_it across our border . I intend to take every available opportunity to offer amendments to federal spending bills , restricting the funds in those bills from going_to illegal aliens . . . . The only health_care that should be provided to an illegal alien is immediate emergency care , after which the illegal alien should be immediately deported. &quot; Crime Williamson : &quot; I favor increasing the number of police on the streets and community policing programs. &quot; Rohrabacher : Opposed anti-crime bill approved by the House earlier this year that is now pending before a House-Senate conference committee . &quot; The way to address our problems with crime is to reform the criminal justice system so that criminals can count_on receiving swift and sure punishment . The ' exclusionary_rule ' ( which prohibits the admission of illegally seized evidence in criminal cases ) needs to be reformed so that all relevant evidence can be used to put the guilty in jail . And we need habeas_corpus reform so that our courts are not tied_up with interminable appeals from convicted criminals. &quot; El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Williamson : Favors development of a commercial airport at El Toro &quot; provided it is economically feasible and it poses no environmental threats. &quot; Rohrabacher : &quot; It is essential for Orange County ' s economy to have sufficient airport capacity . El Toro MCAS is nearly ideally located to provide that capacity and represents a valuable asset that Orange County cannot afford to lose . I strongly support the county initiative that will be_on the November ballot to require the use of El Toro as a commercial airport. &quot; Source : Individual candidates</TEXT>
