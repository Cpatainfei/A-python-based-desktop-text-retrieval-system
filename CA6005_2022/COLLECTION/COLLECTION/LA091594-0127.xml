   <HEADLINE> O.C. CONGRESSMEN OPPOSE LANDING ; HAITI : REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS ARGUE THAT UNITED STATES HAS NO VITAL INTERESTS THAT WOULD WARRANT AN INVASION . THEY CALL DEPOSED PRESIDENT ARISTIDE A MARXIST THUG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sentiment among Orange County lawmakers runs decidedly against the Clinton_Administration ' s planned invasion of Haiti -- particularly one ordered without the permission of Congress -- with some of the congressmen moving to force hearings on the_matter in the House . The delegation of conservative Republicans has argued sternly all week that the United States has no vital national interests in Haiti and denounced Jean-Bertrand Aristide , the deposed leader Clinton seeks to restore to power , as a Marxist thug . Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) offered a resolution to require a debate and vote on any American military maneuvers , saying the rights of the House &quot; are being threatened by the Administration ' s point-blank refusal to seek the authorization of Congress before launching its threatened invasion. &quot; &quot; The U.S. Constitution could hardly be clearer , &quot; Cox said Wednesday . &quot; It grants to the Congress the right to declare war . Only in time of emergency or when the need for secrecy is paramount may the President make war without consulting Congress. &quot; Leaders of both parties find themselves in something of a role reversal from the days when a Republican occupied the White_House and Democrats demanded congressional approval for military_actions . Former President Bush invaded Panama and former President Reagan invaded Grenada without first consulting Congress . This time , the Clinton_Administration contends that the President , as commander_in_chief , has no obligation to obtain the blessings of Congress before moving soldiers into Haiti , and Orange County ' s congressional delegation is braced to do battle with him . &quot; The basic question is , what compelling United States national interest is served by an invasion and occupation of Haiti ? This question must be answered by the President to the satisfaction of the American people and this body , &quot; Rep . Ed Royce ( R-Fullerton ) told his House colleagues . &quot; Any answer by the President must also address the question of an exit strategy , &quot; Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) said . &quot; It must be clear to the American people that this is not another fool ' s errand which will end only when we are forced_out in some ignominious manner. &quot; The Clinton_Administration contends an invasion is justified to stem the tide of immigrants from Haiti and stop human_rights abuses rampant there since Aristide was ousted in a military coup Sept . 30 , 1991 . Since then , &quot; unspeakable violations &quot; have occurred , including the murder of clergy and the slaughter of orphans because Aristide expressed an interest in them , administration officials have said . But Orange County lawmakers denounced Aristide as a &quot; Marxist demagogue &quot; guilty of anti-American statements and worse . &quot; We would support a policy built around freedom and democracy , &quot; Cox said , &quot; but not around this erratic Marxist. &quot; Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) , who has made illegal immigration his cause_celebre , said it is not the dictatorship in Haiti but Clinton ' s economic embargo that is driving people there to flee . &quot; The policy of economic embargo has forced people into their boats because they are starving , &quot; Rohrabacher said in an interview Wednesday . He indicated , however , that he would keep an open mind about the wisdom of an invasion , if the President promised to make his case to Congress . &quot; Maybe there is something I don ' t know , &quot; he said . &quot; But . . . I doubt it. &quot; Meanwhile , Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) took_to the airwaves to denounce Clinton ' s plans while gathering signatures on a letter he wrote to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee H . Hamilton and House Armed Services Chairman Ronald V . Dellums urging hearings on any use of American military_force . &quot; Exactly what vital interests are at stake in Haiti ? Why would we risk American lives to forcibly reinstall Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of Haiti when his views are strongly anti-American ? &quot; Dornan wrote . The Orange County lawmakers also suggested Clinton was moving_in Haiti less as a military strategy than a political one that might restore his sagging popularity before the November elections . Those standing behind Clinton accuse critics of a similar charge , saying partisan politics are keeping Republicans from backing any move the President makes in Haiti , no matter how heinous the conditions there .</TEXT>
