   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIANS KILL 2 ISRAELI SOLDIERS AT CHECKPOINT ; MIDEAST : SLAYERS ESCAPE UNPURSUED INTO NEWLY AUTONOMOUS GAZA . INCIDENT TESTS PEACE PACT WITH PLO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of Israel ' s worst fears became reality Friday when Palestinian militants gunned_down and killed two Israeli soldiers at an unfortified checkpoint just inside the Gaza Strip from this border station and then fled without pursuit into the newly autonomous territory . The pre-dawn killings came just 48 hours after Israel ended 27 years of military occupation in Gaza . For both Israel ' s border troops and the Palestinian police_force that inherited most of the strip this week , it was the first major test of key provisions of the peace agreement that liberated Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho . By all accounts , both sides failed the test . Although the attack occurred close to a heavily fortified Israeli border station , no Israeli troops pursued the gunmen as they sped off into the newly liberated Palestinian territory . The self-rule accord signed earlier this month by Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat after eight months of meticulous negotiations specifically permits such pursuit by Israeli forces in just such circumstances . Israel Radio said the attackers drove_up to the checkpoint in a car , appeared to stop for a security check and shot the two soldiers as they approached the vehicle . The car then sped south as another Israeli soldier fired after it . The killings were followed closely by the wounding of two Israeli garbage_collectors in a drive-by_shooting near a Jewish settlement in Gaza . Hours later , Rabin exercised his only other option : He sealed the Erez border crossing , barring all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from entering Israel for the next nine days and canceling about 2 # 500 work_permits held by Gaza residents . For their part , Gaza ' s new Palestinian police commanders , who are required under the self-rule accord to investigate and apprehend those who stage such attacks , did nothing to bring the assailants to justice . Senior PLO officials and Palestinian military_officers whose responsibility it now is to control the Gaza Strip offered apologies for the slayings . Maj . Gen . Nasser Yussef , the Palestinian commander in Gaza , vowed to take steps to prevent such killings in the future . But most of the newly arrived police_force spent much of the day greeting long-lost relatives and recovering from the arduous journeys that brought them to Gaza this week from throughout the Arab world . &quot; This is a failure for us , &quot; acknowledged Hisham Abdel Razzak , a key PLO leader in Gaza who spent 19 years in Israeli prisons . &quot; But the Israeli public must understand how the situation is . . . . We , the police , are not yet prepared for all_of this . We have not yet organized. &quot; Razzak blamed Western donors for failing to deliver the cash needed to assemble the 2 # 500-strong force and to bring_in additional forces . Nabil Shaath , head of the PLO delegation that negotiated the key details of the self-rule accord , was making a surprise 24-hour visit to Gaza during the attack , and he told reporters that it was not unexpected . &quot; I knew that some incident would happen , and I am very sorry , &quot; he said , interrupting daylong organizational meetings to discuss the killings outside the Palestinians ' new beachfront police_headquarters in Gaza City . &quot; But I am not alarmed . We must now try to prevent a recurrence of this sort of incident. &quot; Shaath met with Israel ' s deputy army chief , Gen . Amnon Shahak , and announced afterward that Palestinian and Israeli security_forces will begin joint patrols in the Gaza Strip today . Like Shaath , Yossi Sarid , Israel ' s environment minister and a key architect of the peace plan , tried to play_down the significance of the killings of the two soldiers , both fathers of newborn children . &quot; These are the first days of the agreement , &quot; Sarid told Israel Radio . &quot; At this time , incidents like these are expected . We hope that when the Palestinian police strengthens , gets organized , pulls itself together , the number of attacks will decrease gradually. &quot; But the sheer number of underground Palestinian armed groups that claimed responsibility for Friday ' s attacks in Gaza illustrated what the new Palestinian police , most of them loyal to Arafat ' s more moderate faction of the PLO , are up against in the well-armed , impoverished and increasingly lawless Gaza Strip . From the minarets of mosques throughout Gaza City , all holding special Friday prayers before today ' s Eid al Adha religious_holiday , the fundamentalist Islamic faction Hamas proclaimed that it had staged the attack . A handwritten poster attributed to Hamas and left outside Gaza City ' s police_headquarters also warned the new Palestinian force : &quot; Don ' t help the Satans and aggressors in our land . . . . This will increase hatred among Palestinians and lead to a new uprising. &quot; Another Palestinian fundamentalist group , the Islamic Jihad ( Holy War ) , also took responsibility for the slayings in leaflets handed to journalists in Gaza and in a handwritten statement faxed to news_agencies in Jerusalem . Yet a third militant faction opposed to the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord , the Damascus-based leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , claimed in a telephone_call to Israel Army Radio that it had staged the drive-by_shooting of the garbage_collectors near Gaza ' s Gush Katif Jewish settlement . Briefing the security committee of Rabin ' s Cabinet on the situation that Israel left_behind in Gaza on Thursday afternoon , military Chief_of_Staff Lt . Gen . Ehud Barak cited the many armed groups that oppose the accord -- as well as a general increase in street crime and looting -- to bolster his assessment that the Gaza Strip is now teetering dangerously close to total anarchy . There was ample evidence of that chaos throughout the strip Friday . As newly arrived Palestinian police hugged and kissed relatives en route to a weekend leave to celebrate today ' s Muslim holiday , traffic snarled , water_mains burst and crime continued apace . Gone were the traffic police who had taken_up positions earlier in the week . And Palestinian officials confirmed that formal police patrols will not begin until early next week . Despite the government ' s attempts to dismiss the shootings as birth pangs in an experiment in Palestinian autonomy , the reaction from Rabin ' s opponents was swift and furious . Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the opposition Likud Party , said the attack proved that the policy of Rabin ' s ruling Labor_Party to make_peace with Israel ' s Arab enemies &quot; has failed. &quot; And Rafael Eitan , leader of another conservative opposition party , said Arafat ' s new police_force is incapable of controlling the fundamentalist Hamas . &quot; I suggest now sending_in huge numbers of troops and killing all_the Hamas people and fighting them before they massacre women and children in the ( Jewish settlements ) or even outside the strip , &quot; Eitan told Israel Radio . Even members of Rabin ' s own party expressed deep concern . Ori Orr , who heads the security and foreign affairs committee in Israel ' s Parliament , said the entire peace process &quot; will fail if this arrangement will not stand_up to the security test. &quot; &quot; To stand_up to the security test means ( that ) terror decreases . If terror increases , there will be no agreement . There will be no one to support the agreement , not just in the opposition but in the Labor Party. &quot; Environment Minister Sarid conceded that if such attacks continue or worsen , it will jeopardize scheduled negotiations to expand Palestinian self-rule to include all_of the West_Bank in the coming years . Referring specifically to Arafat , who backed_down earlier in the week from a speech in which he called_for an Islamic holy war to liberate the disputed city of Jerusalem , Sarid said that if such a holy war materializes , &quot; that will be the end of the experiment. &quot; &quot; I assume he ( Arafat ) understands this . . . . If he proves his efforts are productive and honest , the experiment will continue . If he cannot , or will not , it will finish there , with our withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. &quot;</TEXT>
