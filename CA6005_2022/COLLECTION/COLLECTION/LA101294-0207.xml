   <HEADLINE> MAGMA POWER CALLS GOLDEN PARACHUTE PLAN A COINCIDENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Magma Power Co . said it beefed_up its severance package for executives four days before California Energy Co . offered to buy Magma for $ 820 million . The severance plan , implemented Sept . 15 , calls_for each of Magma ' s six top_executives to be paid double their salary and bonuses if Magma is taken_over and they are terminated , Magma said Tuesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Four days later -- on Sept . 19 -- California Energy Co . offered $ 35 for each of Magma ' s 24 million shares outstanding . The offer consisted_of $ 25 cash and $ 10 of California Energy common_stock . Jon Peele , Magma ' s general counsel , said the timing was a coincidence . &quot; It looks_like there ' s a connection , but there ' s not , &quot; he said . Peele said Magma ' s board actually approved the plan in November , 1993 , but took almost a year to implement it . &quot; We ' re a small company and don ' t have a large staff to do this sort of thing , &quot; he said . Magma ' s board has recommended unanimously that its shareholders reject a hostile tender_offer commenced last week by California Energy for 51 % of Magma ' s outstanding shares at $ 35 a share_in cash . That offer is valued at $ 434 million . California Energy has said it plans to launch a proxy_fight to replace Magma ' s board of directors . California Energy will seek a meeting of Magma shareholders in 30 days , said David Sokol , California Energy ' s chairman . Magma is a geothermal energy company based in San Diego . California Energy , based in Omaha , is also a geothermal energy company and builds electric_power plants . Magma ' s severance plan would cover Magma Chairman Paul Pankratz and President and CEO Ralph Boeker as well as the company ' s general counsel , senior_vice_president of commercial operations , vice_president of North_American operations and chief financial_officer . In the SEC filing , Magma said its board also implemented a less generous severance for nine other Magma officers . They would receive a cash payment equal_to their salary and bonuses if terminated after a takeover .</TEXT>
