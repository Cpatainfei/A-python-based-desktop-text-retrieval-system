   <HEADLINE> WARNINGS ON 757S SHOW FAA ' S DILEMMA ; AVIATION : SOME SEEK INCREASED LANDING DISTANCES IN LIGHT OF DANGEROUS WAKE TURBULENCE . AGENCY IS FORCED TO BALANCE SAFETY AND INDUSTRY ' S ECONOMIC WELFARE IN ISSUING ALERTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the FAA weighed recommendations more_than two years ago to require more landing distance between Boeing 757 jetliners and planes following them , the agency found itself trying to serve two oft-competing masters : the welfare of the public it is charged to protect and the industry it was formed to promote . At the root of recent revelations that the Federal Aviation Administration had repeated warnings that 757s produced dangerous wake turbulence lies a harsh economic reality : The agency knew any landing restriction it imposed would mean flight reductions and further revenue losses for an industry that has gone $ 10 billion in the red since 1990 . After the Dec . 15 crash of a corporate jet in Santa Ana that flew into a 757 ' s wake turbulence , killing all five people aboard , and a similar accident that killed eight people in December , 1992 , some observers believe that the FAA may have chosen the industry ' s rail-thin profit_margin over the public ' s safety margin . The FAA took no action on the 757 turbulence issue -- until recently -- despite compelling evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the United Kingdom ' s Civil Aviation Authority and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . &quot; You can make a safety recommendation , but then the economic factors come_into play , &quot; said Leo Garodz , a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring the 757 wake turbulence problem to the agency ' s attention . An FAA specialist in wake turbulence for 20 years , Garodz said his 1991 recommendations on the 757 were not made lightly , but he is sympathetic to the FAA ' s plight . &quot; You ' re between the_devil and the deep blue sea . On the one hand , you ' ve got safety . On the other , you ' ve got the industry. &quot; The reason for the dilemma , critics say , is easy enough to illustrate : On average , 74 Boeing 757s land daily at Los Angeles International Airport , mostly during peak travel hours . Other jets must remain at least three miles behind . If the FAA landing distance requirement was increased by two miles and made mandatory -- as some suggested after the accidents -- it would effectively push_back all_the planes bound for the airport . To the airlines , it could mean about 30 fewer jets could land during the peak travel day . At an average of 200 passengers per plane , the lost revenue is significant . Multiply that by the number of airports in the country and the millions of dollars in lost opportunity add_up . FAA spokesman Fred O ' Donnell in Los Angeles acknowledged that the agency has twin missions : to keep the skies safe and &quot; to foster the growth of civil aviation. &quot; But he said it was an oversimplification to characterize the 757 decision-making process as a matter of safety versus money . He said the evidence given to the FAA over the last two years , although compelling to many , was inconclusive to the FAA . Since fall , 1991 , at least two reports on the potential dangers of 757 wake turbulence have been presented to the FAA , in addition to anecdotal evidence gathered from pilots by NASA ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System . One report , a study by Garodz and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researcher Kirk Clawson , concluded that the medium-size 757 appeared to generate the most powerful wake turbulence they had ever measured -- more powerful than aircraft nearly four times its size . The researchers recommended that the FAA immediately require smaller planes to stay four miles behind 757s on final approach under all circumstances and that further testing be done . Wake turbulence occurs when a jet speeds through the air , leaving an invisible , but potentially lethal trail of horizontal cyclones that spring out from each wingtip . Such turbulence can cause even mid-size jets to pitch violently and can toss around smaller aircraft like toys . The most recent accident believed to have been linked to 757 wake turbulence claimed the lives of two executives of the In-N-Out burger chain when a twin-engine jet landing about two miles behind a 757 at John Wayne Airport went_out of control . Garodz said the landing distance recommendations &quot; went_over like a lead balloon &quot; because &quot; there always is pressure from the industry to close_down separation distances. &quot; In fact , Garodz said , when the FAA embarked_on the study , which also called_for testing the larger Boeing 767 , it harbored hopes that the results would allow it to decrease the separation requirements for those two aircraft . So did United Airlines , which offered aircraft to use in the study . &quot; United Airlines believes the potential benefit of this scientific test -- proving that airport capacity can be increased 5 % to 10 % by safely reducing the separation between planes -- justifies its contribution of aircraft and crew_members for this study , &quot; James M . Guyette , a United executive_vice_president , said at the time . Garodz and Clawson also advised the FAA that the space requirement for the 767 -- six miles for smaller aircraft -- not be reduced . That , too , was greeted with &quot; less than enthusiasm , &quot; Garodz said . &quot; Nobody likes delays , &quot; he said . &quot; They want to bring the planes closer and increase traffic flow. &quot; To this day , the FAA says it regularly receives proposals from airline carriers , manufacturers and airports to increase the number of passengers they handle by decreasing space requirements . According to the FAA , an average delay of 10 minutes per flight at an airport the size of Seattle-Tacoma International results in a combined $ 93 million in losses for the airline carriers . In 1991 , according to an FAA report , 23 of the nation ' s largest airports each suffered more_than $ 32 million in losses , solely because of delays , many of which occurred because the approach routes to those destinations were packed with planes . The problem is limited navigable airspace . Every airline wants to be in it during convenient flying hours , from dawn to dusk . Any lengthening of distance requirements between aircraft makes_for fewer flights and fewer opportunities for takeoffs and landings during optimal flying times . &quot; They ' ll never say it , but the FAA is in the business of keeping aircraft moving , &quot; said pilot Peter Murray , who has flown commercial jets for 28 years and regularly skippers 757s . &quot; It basically comes_down to dollars and cents. &quot; All of which makes hard-hit airline carriers more interested in reducing airplane separation standards , which would allow them to land more planes more frequently and would improve their bottom_lines . In fact , said John O ' Brien of the Air Line Pilots Assn. , which often finds itself fighting for increased space between aircraft for safety reasons , &quot; we see much more interest in doing these things when people are looking_for a way to better themselves economically. &quot; The FAA acknowledges that there is a direct_correlation between the lack of navigable airspace and aircraft separation requirements , and it is an area of concern to the FAA and the entire industry , spokesman O ' Donnell said . Listed among the goals of the FAA ' s 1991 annual report on the airport capacity problem : &quot; More efficient spacing along the final approach path. &quot; &quot; The FAA ' s position is that there is insufficient capacity in this country to meet the projected needs , &quot; O ' Donnell said . Even though the FAA recently has taken actions that suggest the 757 could be reclassified as a heavy jet , which could require up_to two miles of increased spacing -- from four miles to six -- for smaller trailing aircraft , the agency strongly asserted that it did not sacrifice safety by ignoring the data it had received . However , it was with no information other_than the two recent crashes that prompted FAA Administrator David Hinson to issue a bulletin Dec . 22 , instructing the nation ' s air traffic controllers to tell pilots landing behind 757s they should be aware of potentially heavy turbulence . O ' Donnell said the agency would never compromise the traveling public or the &quot; public that lives under the flight path. &quot; But , he said , &quot; we do recognize that certain orders will have a definite economic impact . . . . We have to ask : ' Will this create an economic hardship that will destroy the industry ? ' &quot; Although the FAA looks_out for airline manufacturers and carriers , O ' Donnell said , the agency does not shirk from taking a tough stand . He referred to the Noise and Capacity Act of 1991 , which requires the industry by 2000 to phase_out older models such_as 727s , 747s and DC-9s in favor of quieter , more fuel-efficient , twin-engine aircraft such_as the 757 , 767 and the new 777 . O ' Donnell said : &quot; The airline industry did not like it . They maintained that it would force many of them out of business . Nevertheless , we felt there was a need to do that , and we did it. &quot; For its part , Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said , the company would need to examine closely any proposal to increase separation distances for the 757 . In addition to the concern about increased delays , Reese said , there is another complication : Many environmentally sensitive airports , such_as John Wayne in Orange County , bar aircraft classified as heavy . Reclassifying the 757 as a heavy would probably make the aircraft builder ' s third-most popular jet less marketable , experts say . &quot; Slots are few and airports are real crowded , &quot; Reese said . &quot; You try to get the airplanes in and out as fast as you can. &quot; At a minimum , aviation sources say , even if the FAA did not want to adopt stricter spacing requirements when it first learned of the 757 ' s wake turbulence problem , it was obliged to alert pilots so they could take extra precautions . Murray , the commercial jet pilot , said air traffic controllers are very busy and frequently encourage pilots to fly under visual flight rules , which takes much of the responsibility for maintaining a safe distance between aircraft off the controller ' s shoulders . &quot; It ' s obvious with this wake vortex problem you can ' t just tell a small-plane pilot : ' There ' s a Boeing 757 in front of you , good_luck . You ' re on your own. ' &quot; He has no way of knowing how far he is from the jet in front of him , &quot; said Murray , whose son flies commuter planes . &quot; He ' s hoping he ' s far enough away , but the controllers know. &quot; O ' Brien of the Air Line Pilots Assn. , which represents 40 # 000 pilots from 38 airlines , said the association for years has asked that the type of wake turbulence testing done on the 757 be made a routine part of the airline certification process . But &quot; there wasn ' t great enthusiasm for that , &quot; he said . It appears a stronger case could be made_for that now , he said . William Reynard , head of NASA ' s Aviation Safety Reporting System , which twice alerted the FAA last year to the 757 problem , said the FAA does the best it can in weighing safety and economic issues . But , he said , &quot; I think it ' s intelligent at this point &quot; that the FAA has begun further testing on the 757 and is considering creating a special category for spacing purposes . Tim Carey , a close friend of John O . McDaniel , the pilot of the plane that crashed in Santa Ana last month after encountering 757 wake turbulence , said safety_factors should far outweigh monetary ones . &quot; I ' m not an aviator , but safety comes first and nothing else should be considered , &quot; Carey said . &quot; Granted , you want your company to make some profits , but I don ' t see throwing_in a risk factor for monetary reasons . &quot; Look what could have been avoided in this case , &quot; he said .
