   <HEADLINE> BLACK FIREFIGHTERS CALL FOR REFORMS ; LABOR : GROUP SAYS DEPARTMENT IS PLAGUED BY RACISM , URGES MAYOR TO APPOINT A BLACK COMMISSIONER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charging that the Los Angeles City Fire_Department is plagued by racism and discrimination , the organization representing African American firefighters called Friday for the mayor to appoint a black fire commissioner and for department officials to implement reforms in the 3 # 100-member force . &quot; ( The Fire_Department ) remains for a vast majority of our members a very hostile , closed organization where systems , safeguards and procedures have been put_in place and which serve to perpetuate a sexist and racist environment , &quot; said Capt . Kwame Cooper , director of the 225-member Los Angeles Stentorians . Flanked by more_than 50 firefighters and supporters , Cooper spoke at a news_conference called to voice support for the findings in a controversial city audit released last month . The scathing study concluded that white males dominate top posts and that women and minorities have been harassed and given unfair evaluations by supervisors , all_in an effort to run them off the force . &quot; Finally , the daily reality and struggle and discrimination which exists in this department has been documented as a widespread problem , &quot; Cooper said , standing in front of an old stucco building south of Downtown that once was one of two all-black firehouses before the department was integrated in 1955 . The group pledged to work with the Fire_Department but threatened legal_action if progress is not made . The harsh criticism by the Stentorians adds_to the growing controversy engulfing the department . The City_Council ' s Personnel Committee plans to investigate the force and has scheduled two hearings this month , which are certain to generate more heat on the department and its chief , Donald O . Manning . Manning has dismissed the Personnel_Department ' s audit as a &quot; hatchet_job &quot; based on unscientific methodology and the grumblings of a_few anonymous firefighters and embittered former employees . Assistant Chief Dean E . Cathey , a department spokesman , denied Friday that racism and discrimination are a widespread problem . &quot; With 3 # 100 firefighters , it would be unrealistic to assume that everyone is going_to get_along , &quot; Cathey said . &quot; But ( it ) is a far stretch to say that this department is plagued by racism and sexism. &quot; He said the department has done more to ensure a harassment-free workplace than any other agency in the city . Cathey added that the department is_well on its way toward implementing reforms . The centerpiece of that effort is a $ 2-million proposal by Manning to create a 17-person human resources bureau that would have recruiting teams , affirmative_action officers and officials who would mentor women and minorities to help improve their promotion rates . A department task_force working to develop that proposal includes members of the Stentorians , Cathey noted , as well as women , Latinos and representatives of the 3 # 000-member firefighters union . The task_force was lauded Friday by Fire Commission President Elizabeth Lowe as a big step_in the right direction . &quot; I feel confident that this team will produce a plan to satisfy all_the issues that have been raised , &quot; Lowe said . At the news_conference , civil_rights attorney Melanie E . Lomax , the Stentorian ' s legal adviser , called_on Mayor Richard Riordan to fill an upcoming vacancy on the Fire Commission with an African American . When Riordan took_office last year , Lomax said , he replaced the five-member board , leaving it without a black representative for the first time in 20 years . A Riordan spokeswoman said Friday that the mayor would select a new commissioner based on qualifications , not race or ethnicity . Lomax , pointing to the audit ' s findings , said there was a clear pattern of harassment and discrimination in the Fire_Department ' s promotions process . The audit said the department has made significant gains in its entry-level hiring , but it found that white males make_up 95 % of the top 20 officials . &quot; Ninety-five percent white male speaks_for itself , &quot; Lomax said .</TEXT>
