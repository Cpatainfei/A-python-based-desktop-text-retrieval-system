   <HEADLINE> MIDEAST COUNTERFEITING MAY HASTEN NEW U.S. DESIGNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Terrorists may be_on the verge of claiming a new victim : the U.S. greenback . Officials at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said the agency is at_work on new designs for U.S. currency amid reports that terrorist organizations may be flooding the world with counterfeit $ 100 bills . The bogus-money problem has become so severe that many overseas banks are refusing to accept the $ 100 bills . A leading terrorist expert said the counterfeit dollars , being produced in the Middle_East by terrorist groups linked to Iran and Syria , could cause serious economic problems especially for small nations that rely_on the U.S. dollar . While confirming work_on a new design , Bureau of Engraving officials were reluctant Thursday to discuss what changes they will recommend that Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen implement or to link the change to the increase of overseas counterfeiting . Congressional sources said they had been told that the Treasury hopes to announce the proposed changes later this month and said the House Banking and Finance_Committee is planning hearings on the issue . Among the ideas said to be under_consideration : Moving portraits to the side , implanting small holograms on the bills , printing on watermarked paper , using multicolored patterns that are difficult for copiers to reproduce and printing with multicolored inks -- all steps other countries have adopted . One of the most dramatic proposals has come from Robert Kupperman , an expert on terrorism . He has called_for a two-tiered money system -- new greenbacks for domestic use and new &quot; redbacks &quot; -- dollars printed in red -- for overseas use . Coin World , a numismatic publication which this week disclosed the redesign effort , said it understood the new currency may closely resemble mock-ups made by the PBS program &quot; Nova. &quot; The &quot; Nova &quot; dollars included safety features used by many foreign countries including multicolor printing , a portrait to the side and watermarked paper . The Treasury_Department has been reluctant to make major changes in the dollar , leaving the United States with what a Secret_Service spokeswoman described as &quot; the most stable currency in the world , and the most easy to counterfeit. &quot; Two years ago the Bureau of Engraving introduced two major changes to high-valued currency : extremely small printing called &quot; micro-printing &quot; and a polyester thread that also contains tiny printing . Coin World said those efforts have failed to thwart the counterfeiters , and youngsters showed the publication how they could easily pull the polyester thread from the new currency . Thomas A . Ferguson , the bureau ' s research_director , confirmed that the agency is close to making final recommendations as_to how the new currency should look . But he rejected suggestions the terrorism concerns had prompted the redesign effort . &quot; I can tell you with conviction that we will not make any changes this year , &quot; he said , noting that it would take longer , perhaps two years or more , to implement any changes . Ferguson said the redesign effort had begun two years ago and &quot; hasn ' t changed in intensity because of any outside issues. &quot; Figures provided by the Secret_Service and interviews with terrorism experts suggest increasing concern within the government over bogus dollars from abroad . In fiscal 1993 , the agency said , there was five times as much counterfeit currency produced overseas ( $ 120 million ) as in the United States ( $ 24 million ) . Kupperman said a group of counterfeiters in Lebanon ' s Bekaa Valley , directed by Iranian and Syrian intelligence agencies , are believed to have produced $ 1 billion worth of &quot; the most nearly perfect $ 100 bills that the Secret_Service has ever detected. &quot; The Secret_Service declined to confirm on that claim , saying it could not comment on any ongoing investigation .</TEXT>
