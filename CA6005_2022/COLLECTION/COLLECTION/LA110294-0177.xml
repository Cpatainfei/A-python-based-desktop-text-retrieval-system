Now , the experts said , the question is how much more tightening will be needed to cool the economy . &quot; The question really is not what they do on the 15th , but how much they do on the 15th , and more importantly , is it having an effect on slowing the economic momentum , &quot; said Jack Shaughnessy , director_of_research at Advest .
