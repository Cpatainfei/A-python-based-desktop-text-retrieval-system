   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS HAVE A GOLDEN EDGE ON HOME ICE ; GOODWILL GAMES : AMERICAN TODD ELDREDGE CLAIMS SILVER MEDAL IN MEN ' S COMPETITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This city might have difficulty producing ice but not ice skaters . Through the Goodwill Games ' first two figure_skating events , pairs and men ' s singles , skaters who train at the Yubileiny Sports Palace have rewarded their fans with four of the six medals , including both golds . Led by Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev , the Winter Olympic gold medalists from 1992 and silver medalists from ' 94 , they swept the first three places in pairs . Later Friday night , 1994 Olympic gold medalist Alexei Urmanov became the men ' s champion , ahead of second-place Todd Eldredge of the United States . Under other circumstances , one might suspect a home-ice advantage for the Russians . But it would hardly be fair to call the Yubileiny ice an advantage for anyone . After the skaters had waited out a 24-hour delay while rink temperatures cooled enough to freeze water , they had few complaints about the ice when the competition finally began Thursday night . But by Friday night , the Goodwill Games ' ice-meisters apparently had overcompensated . The surface , the skaters said , was too hard . Not that any of them wanted to continue making an issue of it . One who started to object , then changed his mind was Urmanov , who said : &quot; I should not have any complaints about the quality of the ice because I won the gold. &quot; Suffering more_than the skaters were members of the St . Petersburg Organizing Committee . Expecting figure_skating to be one of the few sellouts , they have found that the schedule change confused potential ticket buyers . The Friday afternoon session , which was postponed from Thursday night , drew a crowd of about 100 in the 7 # 000-seat Yubileiny . That perhaps was a disappointment for France ' s Surya Bonaly , who skated well enough to lead after the women ' s technical program , but not for three U.S. women . The fewer witnesses there were to their performance , the better -- as Nicole Bobek was fifth , Michelle Kwan sixth and Elaine Zayak seventh in a field of eight . The crowd was bigger Friday night , but Yubileiny remained more_than a_thousand spectators shy of capacity . Judging from their enthusiasm , however , they got their rubles ' worth , especially in the pairs competition as the Russians flaunted their supremacy . Finishing behind Mishkutenok and Dmitriev after the freestyle programs were second-place Marina Yeltsova and Alexei Bushkov , who finished third in this year ' s World Championships , and third-place Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov , the reigning world champions . The young U.S. team of Stephanie Stiegler and Lance Travis , who train at Lake Arrowhead , finished a respectable fifth , one place ahead of their veteran teammates , Calla Urbanski and Rocky Marval , who have resumed their partnership this year after their second breakup in 1993 . Urbanski and Marval were not pleased with the judging , particularly that of the United States ' Joan Gruber , who placed the two American pairs behind not only three of the four Russian teams but also one from Latvia . Gruber was not particularly pleased with Urbanski and Marval , pointing_out that her scores were consistent with those of the other six judges . Easily the happiest American was Eldredge . He did not skate well enough in his freestyle program to upset Urmanov , but he did edge the 1994 Olympic bronze medalist , France ' s Philippe Candeloro . In 1990 , Eldredge was the youngest U.S. champion in 24 years at 18 ; he repeated at 19 , started sliding at 20 and appears now to be making his comeback at 22 . Goodwill Games Notes In women ' s volleyball , Russia swept the United States , 3-0 ( 15-8 , 15-10 , 15-4 ) , to win the gold medal . Japan beat China , 3-1 , for the bronze . . . . In diving , Dmitri Sautin of Russia won the men ' s 3-meter springboard . Scott Donie was the top U.S. finisher in fifth . . . . In men ' s gymnastics , Yevgeni Shabayev of Russia and China ' s Chjon Dun shared gold in the parallel bars , Grigori Misyutin of Ukraine won the vault and Russia ' s Aleksei Voropayev the horizontal_bar . The best U.S. finishers were Scott Keswick , fourth in the vault , and Drew Durbin , fourth in the horizontal_bar . . . . The yachting competition , postponed for two days because of a lack of wind on the Gulf of Filand , was finally completed . The lone U.S. medalist was Eric Oetgen with a silver in the Finn class.GOODWILL GAMES</TEXT>
