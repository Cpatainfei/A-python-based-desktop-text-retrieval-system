   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; TURKEY ' S FOREIGN_MINISTER LOOKS TO NEIGHBORS FIRST ; MUMTAZ SOYSAL MAY REORIENT A COUNTRY DELICATELY BALANCED BETWEEN THE WEST AND NATIONS SUCH AS IRAQ .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a twinkle in his eye , Mumtaz Soysal , Turkey ' s new foreign_minister , fenced with reporters questioning his personal impact on the relationship between the Western powers and his own country , NATO ' s strategic ally on the border with Iraq . How did he define his policy ? Pro-Saddam Hussein ? Isolationist ? Nationalist ? Opportunist ? Was he a dove ? A hawk ? &quot; I am not a bird , &quot; was all_the 65-year-old professor would volunteer . He turned_to welcome more guests to the terrace of his official mansion . It has one of the best views of Turkey ' s capital city , appropriate for the enigmatic man now dominating the country ' s political agenda . Soysal may_not outline the details of his policies , but Turkish commentators have homed_in on his keynote goal of a &quot; foreign_policy with character . . . with honor. &quot; Some believe it may help reorient a country delicately balanced between Europe and the Middle_East , between Russia and the Mediterranean , even between Christianity and Islam . &quot; We are riding for a fall . . . . Turkey has become very successful in establishing policies that will isolate it from the world , &quot; wrote Sedat Sertoglu , foreign affairs commentator for Sabah , the country ' s largest daily . Others have called Soysal a dinosaur , dangerous , even a scourge . Sertoglu has bitterly criticized Soysal about a trip he made to New York a_few months before being named foreign_minister on July 27 . There he acted_as a paid lobbyist for the Iraqi government , urging that the U.N. embargo on Iraq be lifted . Soysal says he has no regrets . &quot; Turkish interest may_not coincide point by point with the interests of our traditional allies . . . . NATO is not anymore the backbone of Turkish foreign_policy , &quot; the soft-spoken , French-educated minister said in a rare interview . &quot; The West thought that , by carrying_on the sanctions , they may topple the regime in Baghdad . We have other aims , Kurdish affairs , the welfare of the region , our commerce. &quot; * Soysal ' s &quot; neighbors first &quot; policy has yet to reverse decades of Turkish policy anchored in the Western alliance . During the latest Persian_Gulf crisis , Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller criticized Iraq and reaffirmed Ankara ' s traditional commitment to U.N. resolutions on Iraq and cooperation with the United States . But Soysal remained silent and questioned whether Hussein had really massed troops on the border . He has come_to symbolize the cracks opening_up in Turkey ' s relationship with the West on a range of issues , including the situations in Iraq , Cyprus and Bosnia-Herzegovina , negotiations on Turkey ' s aim to achieve a customs union with Europe by 1996 and Russia ' s right to intervene in the Caucasus and Central Asia . Soysal ' s supporters argue that a correction was necessary after the strongly pro-American and pro-Western policies of Turkish leader Turgut Ozal , who died in April , 1993 , after a decade in which he opened_up an introverted , isolated Turkey to the world . The new tone in policy also rides a strengthening current of nationalist and Islamist sentiment in Turkey , a gut feeling than runs from the man_in_the_street to an informal , cross-party conservative bloc in Parliament . Its adherents believe that Turkey has been unfairly rebuffed by Europe , that the West has betrayed the Muslims of Bosnia and , against all public evidence , that Europeans favor carving out an independent state for the Middle_East ' s 20 million Kurds , half of whom live_in Turkey . Soysal , a constitutional lawyer jailed as a left-winger after the 1971 coup and later a human_rights activist with Amnesty International , says he believes that ethnic Kurdish aspirations could be managed by giving limited cultural and local_government rights . * He has used his nationalist agenda to block virtually single-handedly Ciller ' s ambitions to privatize Turkey ' s state-dominated economy , even though privatization is a major plank of the International Monetary Fund-backed economic stabilization program of the government . A member of the old-fashioned Social Democrats , a junior partner in Turkey ' s ruling coalition , Soysal favors old-style &quot; national planning &quot; and wants to block foreign investment that has &quot; the sole aim of profit. &quot; Such talk might sound old-fashioned , but it is associated with a new self-assertion by Turkey . One of Soysal ' s first moves decreed that citizens of a dozen countries , including the United States , will now have to stand_in line at border posts to buy symbolic visas in_order to enter Turkey . &quot; Bravo Ankara , &quot; trumpeted a nationalist headline in the daily newspaper Hurriyet . Then came Ankara ' s rejection in August of a 10 % slice in Turkey ' s U.S. military aid loans for fiscal 1995 , which would have been worth a total $ 363 million . Turkey was angry that Congress had made the $ 36.3-million portion conditional upon a State_Department report on Turkey ' s progress on human_rights and Cyprus . But the most important subject for the United States has been Turkey ' s attitude toward Iraq , where Turkey has become increasingly frustrated by Washington ' s insistence on maintaining a tough arm-lock on Saddam Hussein . &quot; It is simply a wrong perception that sanctions to the end against Iraq will bring compromise . We have to accept that Saddam Hussein is there , &quot; Soysal told reporters . &quot; We have been loyal allies for decades . Our policy will be to put our neighbors first . The West has to trust us. &quot; Soysal has a point . In a speech to 400 influential Turks last month , former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger noted that &quot; in every postwar crisis Turkey has proved a reliable friend. &quot; But Turkey does not want to be left_behind as Russia , France and China all quietly court Baghdad , once one of Turkey ' s top three trading partners . A 60-member Turkish business delegation left for Baghdad in August to help revive contacts . Ankara vocally took_up the case for lifting the Iraqi embargo . Foreign access through Turkey to northern Iraq , the Kurdish-populated , U.N.-protected &quot; no-fly &quot; zone , was made subject_to strict new regulations . &quot; America ' s ability to pressure Turkey to execute anti-Iraq policies is waning , &quot; crowed the Baghdad newspaper Babel . Even during the current crisis , Iraq ' s ambassador to Ankara has talked glowingly about how &quot; the new spring in our relationship continues in all its beauty. &quot; * The United States has been worried . &quot; In each case , the Turks are saying , we are not proposing sanctions-busting , we will hold_the_line . But there is an accumulation of issues to discuss , &quot; said a U.S. official before a mid-September visit to Ankara by Assistant Secretary_of_State Peter Tarnoff . Turkey controls the main access route to the ethnic Kurds of northern Iraq . The U.S.-led Western air_force known as Operation Provide Comfort that protects the Kurds also depends_on six-month renewals of its mandate by the Turkish Parliament . Soysal said he gave no assurances to Tarnoff about the scheduled vote this December to extend the mandate during what he said was a &quot; very frank &quot; exchange of views . &quot; We are trying to normalize the situation . . . whereby Provide Comfort might not be necessary , &quot; the Turkish minister explained . &quot; A comfortable situation is ( one where ) Saddam is not likely to attack his Kurds and , because of that , the Kurds are not likely to cross the ( Turkish ) border. &quot; A senior Turkish bureaucrat underlined the same basic guarantee . Turkey , he said , would never allow Saddam Hussein back into the northern stretch of his country without agreement from the two main leaders of the Iraqi Kurds , if only to avoid a repeat of the post-Gulf War refugee crisis when 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds fled across the borders of Turkey and Iran . Turkey has not got much from Iraq in return for its policy except egg_on its face . Even before the latest Gulf crisis , Baghdad had undermined Turkey ' s successful bid for U.S. approval to flush the Iraq-Turkey oil_pipeline , rusting away under the U.N. sanctions ever since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 . But the Baghdad regime refused to agree to resuming its oil exports under the terms demanded by the United Nations : that the proceeds go toward humanitarian aid , with international supervision of the program . * Turkish and Western sources said Hussein ' s government took a hard line because it believed that it could wring more concessions from Soysal . &quot; Turkey is in danger of giving the wrong signal to Iraq , &quot; a senior Western envoy said . &quot; It is that if you hang tough , all this embargo will collapse. &quot; Meanwhile , the Parliament of Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus , angered by a European Community ban on its exports , also took_advantage of the elevation of Soysal , a staunch friend , to harden its negotiating position . Turkey had little choice but to follow_suit with Cyprus . Tensions with Greece also rose during August when a bout of war fever gripped the Turkish press . The fighting talk aimed to make Athens accept that any attempt to enlarge its territorial_waters in the Aegean_Sea would be taken by Turkey as a cause for war . Some Turkish commentators went so far as plotting possible invasion routes into the territory of their North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization partner . Hasan Cemal , a senior commentator for the daily Sabah , expressed concern that the rhetoric had run too far . &quot; It would be more reasonable , &quot; he wrote , &quot; to try to secure external support in Turkey ' s fight against these problems rather than opening_up new fronts. &quot;</TEXT>
