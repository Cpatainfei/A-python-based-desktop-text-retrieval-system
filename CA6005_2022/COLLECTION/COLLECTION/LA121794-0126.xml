   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; SEC COULD HAVE AVERTED CRISIS , SUPERVISORS SAY ; BANKRUPTCY : ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS BLAME FEDERAL AGENCY FOR NOT SOUNDING ALARM AFTER APRIL MEETING WITH EX-TREASURER , AND FOR REFUSING TO FREEZE TROUBLED FUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County supervisors , blindsided this week by a slew of subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission , struck back at the federal agency Friday , charging that the SEC could have prevented the county ' s financial debacle . Some board_members questioned why the SEC failed to step_in last spring , after questioning the county ' s treasurer . And they are angry that the agency refused to freeze the county ' s investment fund earlier this month before the county was forced into bankruptcy . &quot; We asked them for help and they said , ' No , hands off , we ' re not going_to do anything , ' &quot; said Supervisor Roger R . Stanton . &quot; Now the only thing they have done , from the lips of the chairman , is to start throwing rocks. &quot; SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . criticized the board this week in a Los Angeles speech , suggesting that Orange County taxpayers &quot; throw_out the whole bunch &quot; for placing the public ' s savings in such speculative investments . SEC officials have launched a broad investigation of county leaders and the brokerages that underwrote county bonds and sold investments to the now-bankrupt fund . Supervisors complained that SEC investigators met with then-Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron earlier this year to discuss the once- $ 20-billion fund ' s high-risk investment strategy -- which involved short-term borrowing to buy long-term bonds and complex &quot; derivative &quot; securities -- but failed to alert the board to any trouble . &quot; Given the fact that they were looking_at Citron ' s investments in April , what responsibility do they , as a regulatory_agency , have to make the public aware ? &quot; asked Supervisor William G . Steiner . In other developments Friday : * Supervisors approved a plan to start distributing cash to schools , cities and other agencies in danger of not making payroll and other crucial payments . The board ' s action , subject_to approval by a bankruptcy judge , would release up_to $ 153 million in now-frozen funds for &quot; urgent and essential needs &quot; among investors . * Santa Ana city officials lobbied furiously for the right to withdraw $ 9.8 million from the fund , one day after defaulting_on a debt service payment for the city ' s massive jail construction project . City_Manager David N . Ream said that if the city does not get the $ 5.3 million it was supposed to pay Thursday , plus $ 4.5 million to pay December contractors ' fees , officials will be forced to halt the project . * San Diego County ' s treasurer announced a $ 357-million &quot; paper loss &quot; in that county ' s investment fund , blaming risky investments similar to those Citron purchased . The treasurer asked local agencies not to pull money out of the fund for fear of starting a run . * Salomon Bros. , the investment house now assisting Orange County , auctioned another $ 1 billion in fund-owned securities on the market , part of the court-approved liquidation of the county ' s remaining portfolio , which stood at $ 7.96 billion early in the week . * Citron has been called to testify at an SEC hearing in Los Angeles on Jan . 20 , sources said . He is expected to be quizzed about his relationship with various brokers who did business with the county . * The family of Laura Small -- a 13-year-old-girl who received a $ 1.6-million settlement from the county after she was mauled by a mountain_lion in a much-publicized attack at a county park in 1986 -- sued county officials Friday . The Smalls had $ 90 # 000 in the county fund . * The Tustin Unified School District board approved $ 1 million in cutbacks -- the amount the district has frozen in the county pool . The board imposed a hiring freeze on substitute teachers and teacher aides and delayed buying new textbooks and other instructional materials until June . * School officials said Foothill Ranch Elementary would open as scheduled Jan . 3 , despite an announcement earlier in the week that the bankruptcy had put the school ' s opening on indefinite hold . Other good news came as the supervisors announced that money would be made available as soon as Monday for public agencies that have been struggling since Dec . 6 , when the county became the nation ' s largest municipality ever to file for bankruptcy . Under the plan , fund investors initially would receive up_to 30 % of their original investment in the county fund for emergency needs . That allotment eventually would be deducted from their total share , which will depend_on the money recovered from the fund ' s ill-fated investments , said Bruce Bennett , the county ' s bankruptcy attorney . Emergency Funds According to the agreement -- which must be approved by a federal judge -- agencies would each receive a designated amount to cover specific expenses . Schools would receive the largest amount , $ 115 million , to meet payroll and pay vendors . The Transportation Corridor Agency would get $ 20.6 million by Dec . 22 for contract work_on the Foothill and San Joaquin Hills toll roads . The county intends to withdraw $ 25.6 million . Other creditors also would be given funds to meet payroll and bills , with the city of Anaheim receiving $ 8.5 million , the Orange County Water District $ 4.6 million , the Orange County Transportation Authority $ 3 million and the Orange County Sanitation District $ 900 # 000 . Supt . Paul Possemato of the Laguna Beach Unified School District said Friday he was &quot; very pleased &quot; to hear that the supervisors had taken action toward meeting the pressing needs of schools . Local superintendents &quot; have been waiting for a cash flow response ( from the county ) for about a week now , &quot; Possemato said . &quot; This will give more assurance to our employees that while the solutions are difficult , there ' s an attempt to meet our needs. &quot; Some attorneys representing cities , schools and special districts have suggested that state law defines the county pool as a simple trust_fund , requiring the county to repay investing agencies in full before withdrawing any money for itself . &quot; The fund itself was essentially a bank_account , &quot; said Ronald Rus , who represents three cities and three water districts in the case . The trust_fund provision of the law states that &quot; when any public entity or any public official . . . who is required or authorized by law to deposit funds in the county treasury , makes a deposit , those funds shall be deemed to be held_in trust . . . . The funds shall not be deemed funds or assets of the county. &quot; U.S. Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany acknowledged Friday that state law describes the county treasury as a trust_fund , but dismissed as &quot; shortsighted &quot; and &quot; very dangerous &quot; the idea that this law means other investors should get 100 % before the county takes a penny . &quot; There is certainly a California code section that provides that these are trust_funds , &quot; said Tiffany , who is overseeing the case for the federal Bankruptcy Court . &quot; that ' s all it does . It says nothing about recovering money first . This is an argument that somebody ' s been throwing_out there , and I think it ' s a terrible idea . It ' s self-defeating and contrary to the whole goal of what we ' re doing here. &quot; If all other investors were repaid in full , the county could lose about three-quarters of the nearly $ 3 billion it has tied_up in the fund . The market_value of the fund ' s remaining investments , minus loans yet to be repaid , was estimated at $ 5.4 billion this week -- a 27 % decline from what investors originally put_in . &quot; What it would amount to is suicide . It ' s like choking yourself with your own hand , &quot; Tiffany said . &quot; How can entities within the county ( survive ) if the county isn ' t functioning ? The county has to be viable . The county has to be able to sell bonds . The county has to be able to raise money . If the county can ' t do that , the county will wither and die. &quot; While a plan was put_in place to distribute the money , Orange County continued its efforts Friday to sell_off its troubled portfolio and garner cash for its investors . The county on Friday sold longer-term U.S._government agency bonds with a principal value of $ 566 million at prices ranging from 96 cents to 98.75 cents on the dollar . Salomon also sold $ 440 million in foreign bank-issued &quot; derivative &quot; securities -- the first of the more complex securities that are to be liquidated . Including the $ 483 million in bonds sold on Thursday , Salomon now has unloaded $ 1.49 billion in securities . Salomon executives concede that they are racing the clock to sell the rest of the portfolio , as the holidays thin the ranks of investment professionals willing to take time to look_at the securities . The brokerage ' s ability to unload the derivatives at fair prices is key to assuring that fund investors get_back 73 cents for each $ 1 they invested -- the recovery estimate Salomon gave earlier this week . &quot; I ' m very pleased with the results &quot; of the auctions , said Thomas W . Hayes , the former state_treasurer who is advising the county . &quot; However , we are still in a very risky position and will move prudently to continue to remove those risks. &quot; County supervisors were optimistic about the sales , but they smoldered Friday over the SEC ' s handling of the county ' s fiscal crisis . SEC Involvement The SEC first looked_at the Orange County pool last April , when Citron ' s investment practices became an issue in his reelection campaign . At the time , Citron was locked_in a contentious battle and his opponent accused him of unwisely gambling with the public ' s money as interest_rates shot_up . After speaking with Citron , SEC officials reported that they found his strategies risky , though not illegal , sources told The Times this week . But the officials also said they had assurances that there was government oversight of the fund . Earlier this month , when Citron announced the initial &quot; paper loss &quot; to his fund , SEC investigators were back at the Hall of Administration , spending the weekend before the county declared bankruptcy poring over documents relating to the portfolio . In the days since the bankruptcy , the SEC has widened its probe of the county ' s financial dealings , serving subpoenas on all five supervisors Wednesday , seeking bank_statements , diaries and other personal records . Citron also was subpoenaed . The relationship has been contentious from the start . Last week , Steiner accused the SEC of refusing the county ' s pleas for help so it could use the fund ' s failure as a lobbying argument to increase its regulatory powers . The SEC ' s William McLucas decried the allegation as &quot; absolutely absurd , &quot; saying : &quot; Somebody must have been smoking something or dropped_in from planet Mars. &quot; Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley was still upset Friday after hearing about Levitt ' s speech . &quot; When I read this I felt maybe we should challenge his qualifications for what he is doing , &quot; Riley said . Riley lashed_out about implications that board_members may have taken kickbacks from bond dealers . &quot; It ' s a complete insult , &quot; he said . Times staff writers Jodi Wilgoren , Dan Weikel , Chris Woodyard , Greg Johnson , Julie Marquis , Lee Romney and Tom Petruno , and correspondents Jeff Bean and Hope Hamashige in Orange County , contributed to this report .
