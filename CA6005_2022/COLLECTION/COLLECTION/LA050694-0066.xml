   <TEXT> Actor and singer Noel Harrison was scheduled to unveil his award-winning show , &quot; Adieu , Jacques . . . , &quot; a musical tribute to the late French singer and songwriter Jacques Brel , to San Fernando Valley audiences Thursday night at the new Ventura Court Theatre in Studio City . Harrison , the son of late actor and theater legend Sir Rex Harrison , is probably best remembered for starring with Stephanie Powers in &quot; The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. &quot; television series in the mid-1960s and for his several Top 40 recordings , including the Academy Award-winning &quot; Windmills of Your Mind &quot; ( 1968 ) . More recently , he has performed roles in regional productions of various stage musicals , including Henry Higgins in &quot; My Fair Lady , &quot; a role his father originated on Broadway . Harrison has performed &quot; Adieu , Jacques . . . &quot; off and on since 1989 . Last year , he won a Drama-Logue Award for his performance . In the show , Harrison , accompanying himself on the guitar , sings 15 of Brel ' s compositions in French and provides an English translation . Harrison has admired Brel ' s work for more_than 30 years . &quot; I saw him perform live_in 1960 , &quot; Harrison said . &quot; As a kid , I was attracted to French music , and I was very moved. &quot; Brel was born in the Flemish section of Belgium in 1929 . His musical career began in the early 1950s , and he became one of France ' s most successful entertainers . At the height of his popularity in 1967 , he quit his music career to pursue other interests . He didn ' t make another record until 1977 , just months before he died of lung_cancer . Harrison is not the only one showcasing Brel ' s songs in Los Angeles . Another show featuring Brel ' s music , &quot; Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well . . . and Living_in Paris , &quot; starring Teri Ralston , Jeff McCarthy , Jeffrey Rockwell and Sue Hull , is at the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill in Hollywood . This 1968 show , which has been produced many times and was also made into a feature_film , is primarily responsible_for introducing Brel to American audiences . An ensemble cast of four singers usually performs translations of 23 Brel compositions . &quot; Mine is a totally different show , &quot; Harrison said . &quot; People with an interest in Brel would enjoy both productions. &quot; Harrison ' s show is the first mounted at the new Ventura Court Theatre . The theater management boasts of its new , state-of-the-art equipment , including computerized lighting and sound_systems . &quot; Adieu , Jacques . . . &quot; will run 8 p.m. Thursdays , Fridays and Saturdays through May 28 at the theater , 12417 Ventura Ct. , Studio City . Tickets are $ 15 . Call ( 818 ) 763-3856 . THERE GOES THE BRIDE : The Cal State Northridge production of Federico Garcia Lorca ' s &quot; Blood Wedding &quot; ( &quot; Bodas de Sangre &quot; ) continues tonight in the Little Theatre . The play , which will be presented in Spanish and English , is a co-production of the CSUN theater and foreign language departments . The English version of the play will feature student actors from the theater arts_department , and the Spanish version will be performed by foreign language students . The two departments have been collaborating on annual productions since 1990 , said Dorette Egilsson , a foreign language professor and professional actress who is the production ' s director . &quot; I love Lorca , &quot; Egilsson said . &quot; It ' s a real challenge for the actors. &quot; Lorca ( 1895-1936 ) , one of Spain ' s best-known modern poets and playwrights , was killed by Falangist soldiers in the opening days of the Spanish Civil War . He wrote &quot; Blood Wedding , &quot; his most famous work , in 1933 . The story is about a bride in an arranged marriage who runs_away with her lover . The lover is subsequently murdered by the husband . &quot; ' Blood Wedding ' was picked because of its tremendous passion , &quot; Egilsson said . &quot; It awakens the tragic emotions of pity and terror , with the ultimate anguish of the mother and the bride. &quot; The English version will be presented at 8 p.m. today , Saturday and Sunday . The Spanish version plays Thursday and May 13 to 15 . There also are matinees . Tickets are $ 8 , $ 6 senior_citizens and $ 4 CSUN students . For a complete performance schedule , call ( 818 ) 885-3093 . AT THE MOVIES : Close to four months after the Northridge temblor , three movie_theaters in the greater San Fernando Valley area remain closed due_to earthquake damage : the General Cinema Center in Northridge , the United Artists Valley Plaza theater in North Hollywood and the Mann Sycamore theater in Simi Valley . Of the three , the Mann theater seems closest to a reopening date . A Mann representative said that although a definite date has not been set , the theater is expected to reopen before summer . United Artists officials in Colorado have scheduled July 1 as the reopening date of the Valley Plaza Theater . &quot; We had an extensive amount of seismic-upgrade work , &quot; project manager Tim Ward said . &quot; And we did some remodeling as well. &quot; Meanwhile , a General Cinema representative said no decision has been reached on whether the Northridge theater will reopen . Because of the severe damage to Northridge Fashion Center , where the theater is located , company personnel have not been able to inspect the premises , so no decision has been made on its future .</TEXT>
