   <TEXT> * I would like to respond to the letter regarding the release of female prisoners from the Sybil Brand Institute for Women ( Dec . 21 ) . Sybil Brand Institute does care about the women in its custody ; and this concern continues when those women are released from confinement , whether it is pursuant to a court_order or at the completion of their sentence.Those inmates who are released by order of the court are released in the afternoon or evening , and always before midnight . Those who are released at the completion of their sentence are released each morning after breakfast . Our release policy takes into consideration that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has a bus_stop directly in front of the facility , which runs daily from 5 a.m. to midnight . Sybil Brand Institute provides free bus tokens to any inmate upon request . Taxi service is available 24 hours each day , and telephones are located in the release area and front-gate area of the institute . The gate is manned 24 hours each day by deputy personnel , who will assist released inmates as needed . As an additional measure of security , no inmates are released between midnight and 6 a.m. , unless they have someone to pick them up . For those inmates who have an impending release , and are in need of assistance , we have support groups such_as Friends Outside , Mary Magdalene Project and the multidenominational chaplain ' s office , which assist in providing transportation or locating overnight housing .
