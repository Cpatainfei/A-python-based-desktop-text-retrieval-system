   <HEADLINE> OREGON VOTERS ALLOW ASSISTED SUICIDE FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oregon has become the only place in the nation that will let doctors hasten death for the terminally ill . Measure 16 on Tuesday ' s ballot passed 52 % to 48 % Thursday . Not all_the absentee_ballots were counted , but both sides said they do not expect the margin to change when the tally is completed today . Measure 16 will allow a patient with six months to live to ask a doctor to prescribe a lethal_dose of drugs to end unbearable suffering . At least two doctors must first agree that the patient ' s condition is terminal . The patient must request the drugs at least twice , then a third time in writing . It is up_to the patient to take the final step and administer the drugs . Many Oregon doctors welcomed the prospect of legalizing suicide with a physician ' s help . They said that it has long been a common practice with the terminally ill . &quot; The physicians who are presently involved and have kept it secret and are in the closet , so to speak , will now be able to speak_to their colleagues and say : ' I will do this in the future because I think it ' s appropriate care , ' &quot; said Dr. Peter Goodwin , a medical_school professor and a leading supporter of Measure 16 . Similar measures were defeated in Washington in 1991 and California in 1992 , but those initiatives differed significantly by allowing a doctor to administer the drugs . Last year , lawmakers in the_Netherlands approved guidelines that allow doctors to assist in the suicide of a patient . The national debate over euthanasia intensified 4 1 / 2 years ago when Janet Adkins , a victim of Alzheimer ' s disease , killed herself with the help of Jack Kevorkian , who has been present at 20 deaths since 1990 . &quot; The legalization of any form of assisted suicide will have just tremendous consequences that will reverberate through American society , &quot; said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania School_of_Medicine in Philadelphia . Geoffrey Fieger , attorney and spokesman for Kevorkian , said of the Oregon measure : &quot; It ' s just the first domino to fall. &quot; Measure 16 foes warned that Oregon could become a haven for doctors like Kevorkian and could attract the terminally ill from around the world . But Caplan and others rejected that notion .</TEXT>
