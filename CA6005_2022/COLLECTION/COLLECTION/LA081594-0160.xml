   <HEADLINE> HEAT SETS NO RECORDS , BUT SURF PACKS A PUNCH ; WEATHER : SLIGHT RELIEF FROM TRIPLE-DIGIT TEMPERATURES IN SIGHT . HUNDREDS IN O.C. PLUCKED FROM RIP_CURRENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern Californians continued to swelter in triple-digit temperatures in many places Sunday , but for the first time in three days the heat did not reach record levels , and meteorologists said there may be some relief -- though not much -- by midweek . The suffocating heat drew tens of thousands of people to Orange County beaches , where the dangerous combination of large surf -- up_to 10 and 12 feet at some beaches -- and heavy rip_currents prompted hundreds of surf rescues , more_than twice the usual number , lifeguards said . The National Weather Service reported Sunday that temperatures reached 92 degrees in Santa Ana , cooler than Saturday ' s 100-degree temperature , which tied the city ' s record high for that date . Temperatures also cooled slightly elsewhere , with 97 degrees at El Toro , 93 in Anaheim and 81 in Newport Beach . Forecasters said Orange County can expect temperatures to drop another two to five degrees over the next few days , with mostly clear skies through Tuesday except for patchy late-night and early morning clouds and fog at the coast . However , the slight respite Sunday provided little consolation to people who flocked to area beaches and kept lifeguards and rescue boats scrambling in the heavy surf and rip_currents produced by a strong , south swell from tropical storms Ileana and John off Mexico . In Laguna Beach , where an estimated 35 # 000 people mobbed the beaches , lifeguards made about 350 rescues , 100 alone at Main Beach , according to Scott Diederich , Laguna Beach marine safety officer . &quot; From 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. , we had 12 calls_for medical_aid for swimmers , &quot; Diederich said . &quot; This was for a variety of neck and back injuries and fractured ribs. &quot; More_than 50 # 000 people visited Huntington State Beach , one of the county ' s largest and most dangerous in terms of wave action , said Huntington State Beach Lifeguard Supervisor William Pfeiffer . &quot; Swimmers get_in the water , and we really have a good side current of two to three knots pulling them into the rip and all that water is coming onshore and pushing_out , pulling people out_to sea , &quot; Pfeiffer said . Newport Beach lifeguards reported surf as high as 10 to 12 feet . In Seal Beach , lifeguards took the special precaution of closing 100 yards of beach to swimmers immediately north of the city pier . &quot; We had a very inexperienced swimming crowd today , and then large surf and heavy rip_currents , &quot; said Andrew Seymour , Seal Beach director of parks , beaches , and recreation . &quot; ( The beach closure ) was an unusual move , but it ' s a safety precaution . Our rescue boat was working hard today. &quot; Seal Beach lifeguards had heavy duty on the city ' s west-end beaches near the San Gabriel River , but a professional volleyball match held_on the sand was watched by thousands of spectators who stayed out of the water . Still , Seymour said some swimmers got towed by rip_currents 200 yards from shore . &quot; It ' s a long rescue caused by a combination of the outflow of the San Gabriel River plus the heavy surf , &quot; Seymour said . &quot; Our rescue boat was kept very busy plucking people from the surf . We also had to rescue about seven to eight surfers . Two of them left their surfboards. &quot; &quot; that ' s when you know you have a problem , &quot; he added , &quot; when you see someone in the water swimming away from their surfboard. &quot; Rough waves may force cancellation of a Dr. Pepper soft_drink commercial scheduled to be filmed Tuesday , Seymour said . The commercial involves anchoring a barge several hundred feet from shore near 8th Street where fireworks would be detonated . Meteorologist Curtis Brack of WeatherData Inc. , which provides forecasts for The Times , said the two tropical storms are declining and the surf should &quot; slack_off in the next couple of days. &quot; Brack said the heat_wave was caused by a very strong high_pressure area over California that was blocking cooler marine air from coming inland . But as the week progresses , &quot; skies should be clearing_out somewhat , &quot; he said , allowing temperatures to drop further . Nevertheless , meteorologists were not ruling_out a return to record highs . &quot; Unfortunately , I can ' t promise much relief yet , &quot; said Bruce Entwistle of the National Weather Service , predicting that temperatures &quot; will bounce up and down a_few degrees each day. &quot; In addition , the weather may become more humid , he said . In San Bernardino County , more_than 700 firefighters continued to fight two brush_fires touched_off by lightning Saturday . By midafternoon Sunday , the 1 # 800-acre fires north of Lake Arrowhead were reported 50 % under_control , with no injuries . &quot; Right now we are looking_at the real hot_weather and more thunderstorms coming , &quot; said Tom Sensintaff , a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service , which was coordinating firefighting efforts . A Hesperia family was hospitalized after they were struck by lightning under a tree during a storm at Hesperia Lake . Firefighter Daren Brown said the lightning struck Leona Ellis , who was holding her 2 1 / 2-year-old daughter . &quot; It ran_through her , the baby and all_the people who were around there , &quot; Brown said . Ellis , the child and the baby ' s 55-year-old grandmother were in stable condition at San Bernardino County Medical_Center on Sunday . Another daughter , two sons and another boy complained of a tingling feeling or loss of sensation and were hospitalized . Safety officials advise against seeking shelter under trees during thunderstorms . The hottest spots in Southern California on Sunday included Monrovia and Montebello , with highs of 103 degrees , Pasadena at 102 and San Bernardino , where the temperature reached 100 at the 3 p.m. measuring time . Southern California Edison reported that in Orange County , about 1 # 100 customers experienced weekend service interruptions lasting from four hours to as long as 20 hours . Chriss Brown , an Edison spokesman , said that work crews had been working since Friday repairing 110 failed transformers .
