   <TEXT> With massive military preparations pointing to an imminent U.S. invasion of Haiti , President Clinton delivered a blunt message to the Caribbean nation ' s military dictators : &quot; Your time is up . Leave now or we will force you from power. &quot; The President , grim-faced during a 15-minute nationally televised speech from the White_House on Thursday night , combined an unequivocal warning to the Haitian regime that military_action is at_hand with an unusually direct appeal for support from an American public still skeptical and unconvinced that vital U.S. interests are at stake . &quot; In Haiti , &quot; he declared , &quot; we have a case in which the right is clear , in which the country in_question is nearby , in which our own interests are plain , in which the mission is achievable and limited , and in which the nations of the world stand with us . We must act . &quot; I know the American people are rightfully concerned whenever our soldiers are put at risk , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I assure you that no President makes decisions like this one without deep thought and prayer . But it ' s my job as President and commander_in_chief to take those actions that I believe will best protect our national security interests. &quot; The speech was Clinton ' s first full-scale effort to make his case for an invasion if the regime led by Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras continues to reject demands by the United States and the United Nations that it yield power . &quot; Once again , I urge them to do so , &quot; Clinton said , but &quot; they must move now . If they do not , the international community will act to honor our commitments. &quot; Clinton ' s warning was greeted with more defiance in Port-au-Prince . Cedras , interviewed by CBS-TV immediately after Clinton ' s speech , said : &quot; I am rather prepared to fight with my people . . . . We are all ready to fight with the means we have . &quot; The Haitian people have an extraordinary resistance capacity , &quot; he added . &quot; Those three years spent under economic sanctions have proven what I say . The people are ready to resist. &quot; Earlier in the day , Cedras had said that a U.S. invasion would lead to civil_war and a &quot; massacre. &quot; He predicted &quot; loss of life on both sides and also civilian casualties. &quot; White_House officials said Clinton has decided to instruct the U.S. ambassador in Haiti , William L . Swing , to deliver private ultimatums to each of the top three military_leaders -- Cedras ; his chief_of_staff , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby ; and Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , the police_chief -- to leave the country or face capture by U.S. troops . Swing may deliver the messages within the next two days . Swing will give the Haitians a fixed deadline to step_down , the officials said , but the deadline will not be made public , to avoid touching_off possible attacks by the military ' s backers against supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide or U.S. citizens in Haiti . Aristide , the first and only democratically elected president in Haitian history , was deposed by the military junta on Sept . 30 , 1991 . U.S. policy is to restore him to power . The officials said Swing also will repeat Clinton ' s offer to guarantee the Haitian junta leaders safe passage out of the country and help in establishing them in exile . Other officials said the CIA has been authorized to spend substantial amounts_of_money , if necessary , to get the Haitians out of the country -- without resorting_to outright bribery , however . The officials said Clinton authorized the CIA to spend up_to $ 12 million on a range of covert_operations in Haiti , including moving the dictators into exile . In seeking to rally public support behind his policy , the President offered four basic arguments to support his contention that vital U.S. interests are at stake in Haiti : * Supporting democratic governments , especially in countries close to home , strengthens America ' s own security and fuels domestic prosperity , because history has shown free governments to be more stable and peaceable than dictatorships . They are also more likely to foster open economies that satisfy the aspirations of their people and open_up trading opportunities for the United States . * Continued chaos and repression in Haiti will lead to ever-larger waves of refugees risking their lives to escape to the United States , creating vexatious problems and burdensome costs for this country . About 14 # 000 Haitian refugees are already living_in camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and the Haiti problem has cost taxpayers almost $ 200 million so far , he noted . * The United States has a special responsibility to move against brutal violations of human_rights when they occur close to America ' s shores . &quot; I know that the United States cannot , indeed we should not , be the world ' s policeman . . . . But when brutality occurs close to our shores it affects our national interest and we have a responsibility to act , &quot; he said , reciting in grim detail an increasingly murderous record that he blamed on the Haitian regime . * The United States , dating_back to the Administration of former President George_Bush , has been committed to restoring Aristide to power ; maintaining American credibility around the world requires it to follow_through on its own commitments and to insist on compliance with commitments made to the United States by others . Clinton said that the United States &quot; has strong interest in not letting dictators , especially in our own region , break their word to the United States and the United Nations. &quot; In his appeal for public support at_home , the President said U.S. military_leaders have worked hard to minimize risks to American troops . &quot; But the risks are there -- we must be prepared_for that. &quot; Addressing concerns voiced by many Americans that U.S. troops might be bogged down in Haiti for a protracted period , Clinton declared that most of the invasion force would be returned home within a matter of months -- &quot; not years. &quot; Administration officials said they still think that there is a possibility that Cedras , Biamby and Francois will decide to leave the country at the last minute . Even if they do , U.S. forces would still enter Haiti to restore order and train a civilian-controlled security_force to replace the thugs who now control the country , the officials said . The U.S. mission will be specific and limited , declared Clinton , who has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for refusing to seek congressional approval of the invasion . He compared the mission to the invasion of Grenada during the Ronald Reagan_Administration and the invasion of Panama during the Bush_Administration . Neither Reagan nor Bush sought congressional approval before acting . And in describing the aftermath of the Haitian military coup , when the dictators launched &quot; a horrible intimidation campaign of rape , torture and mutilation , &quot; he quoted then-President Bush as declaring that the situation posed &quot; an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security , foreign_policy and economy of the United States. &quot; Clinton said the Haitian mission would be carried_out in two phases . First would come the removal of the military dictators from power and restoration of Aristide , who was chosen as president with almost 70 % of the vote . Aristide served nine months before being overthrown . After a Haitian security_force that would &quot; protect the people rather than repress them &quot; had been trained , Clinton said , police monitors from other countries supporting the U.S. mission &quot; will work with the authorities to maximize basic security and civil_order and to minimize retribution. &quot; In the second phase , he said , a much smaller U.S. force -- estimated at less than 3 # 000 by Administration officials -- will join forces with other U.N. contingents to help Haiti rebuild its society and move toward new elections next year . This contingent would be scheduled to leave Haiti after a new Haitian government takes_office in early 1996 . Clinton said Aristide , a controversial figure who some critics have described as radical and even unstable , has pledged to step_down when his term as president ends next year . The President spoke slowly and forcefully as he painted a graphic picture of a reign_of_terror conducted by &quot; Cedras and his armed thugs , executing children , raping women , killing priests . As the dictators have grown more desperate , the atrocities have grown even more brutal. &quot; International observers , he said , uncovered &quot; a terrifying pattern of soldiers and policemen raping the wives and daughters of suspected political_dissidents -- young_girls -- 13 , 16 years old -- people slain and mutilated , with body_parts left as warnings to terrify others , children forced to watch as their mothers ' faces are slashed with machetes. &quot; Clinton ' s effort to explain his position to the public came none too soon , as opinion polls and scattered anti-invasion demonstrations made clear . Shortly before Clinton ' s speech , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry announced that about 1 # 600 military reservists will be called_up for possible service in Haiti . If the Haitian dictators stand_fast and Clinton orders the invasion , a quick military victory seems assured because Haiti ' s ragtag army of about 7 # 000 men would be hopelessly overmatched against the allied force of at least 20 # 000 well-armed troops . But if there are substantial American casualties or embarrassing accidents caused by the fog of war , the operation could seem to be a defeat for the Administration even if all_of the military objectives are ultimately met . And it did not take long for the operation to produce an embarrassing mishap . A Navy fast patrol_boat , the Monsoon , went aground on what the Navy said was an uncharted sandbar about two miles off the coast of Haiti . A Coast Guard vessel helped to free the Monsoon late Thursday . Wanted : Haiti ' s Outlaw Leaders President Clinton has demanded that these three Haitian leaders step_down . If they do not , he has vowed to send_in American troops to oust them . RAOUL CEDRAS Position : Army commander A reputed protege of the late dictator Francois ( Papa Doc ) Duvalier , Cedras is the son of a Duvalier official in the southeastern town of Jeremie . He graduated in 1973 from the Haitian military_academy and was sent by Duvalier for training in the United States , Spain , Mexico and Taiwan . Duvalier ' s son and successor , Jean-Claude ( Baby Doc ) , appointed him to the elite anti-guerrilla Leopards Corps . After the younger Duvalier fled into exile in 1986 , Cedras was put_in charge of security for the 1989 elections in which Jean-Bertrand Aristide was chosen president . Subsequently , Aristide appointed him interim commander-in-chief of the army . In September , 1991 , Cedras headed the bloody coup that drove Aristide from the island . MICHEL-JOSEPH FRANCOIS POSITION : Port-au-Prince police_chief The notoriously secretive Francois is widely considered the mastermind of Haiti ' s ongoing wave of murderous repression . He himself denies that he even heads the capital ' s police_force , claiming instead to be military commander of the capital district -- even though he wears a police uniform , carries a policeman ' s helmet and has his office in police_headquarters . Son of an army major who served in palace security and was promoted by Francois Duvalier , he graduated in 1981 from the Haitian military_academy , where he was a student of current army chief Cedras , and then attended the U.S. command school for foreign officers at Ft . Bragg , N.C. He reportedly had a major role in the 1991 coup . His older brother , Evans , was once a professional diplomat . PHILIPPE BIAMBY POSITION : Army chief_of_staff Like Cedras and Francois , Biamby is the son of a prominent member of the Francois Duvalier regime . His father was once defense and interior minister and also worked as the dictator ' s private secretary . Thought to be the most hard-line member of the triumvirate , Biamby graduated from Haiti ' s military_academy in the same class as Cedras . In 1989 , he led an unsuccessful coup against Lt . Gen . Prosper Avril , who was then president . Forced_out of the military , he fled to the Dominican_Republic and then to the United States , where he was arrested on immigration charges and spent six months in a New York immigration prison . After Aristide was overthrown , Cedras reinstated him almost immediately . He reportedly lives very austerely , sleeping either at the general_headquarters or in the room at his mother ' s house he has had since he was a child .</TEXT>
