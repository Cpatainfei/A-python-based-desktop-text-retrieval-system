   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN-CROATIAN TALKS GET UNDER WAY IN WASHINGTON ; DIPLOMACY : ON THE TABLE IS A U.S.-BACKED PROPOSAL TO CREATE A MUSLIM-CROAT STATE . BUT INITIAL DISCUSSIONS PRODUCE NO AGREEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Negotiators from Bosnia-Herzegovina and neighboring Croatia began talks Saturday on a U.S.-sponsored plan to end the Bosnian civil_war and reported a promising start but no immediate results . &quot; There is a goodwill and a desire on both sides to make progress , &quot; the prime_minister of Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government , Haris Silajdzic , said after a day of meetings at the State_Department . &quot; We hope we are_on the right track. &quot; The talks included officials representing the Bosnian government , Bosnia ' s minority of Roman_Catholic Croats and the Croatian government -- but not neighboring Serbia or the Bosnian Serbs who have seized more_than two-thirds of Bosnian territory . On the table is a U.S.-backed plan under which Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats would create a joint multiethnic state in about half of the country , seek some kind of federation with the Bosnian Serbs and build an economic union with Croatia . &quot; It was a good , serious discussion -- but no deal yet , &quot; a senior State_Department official said . Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic , who led his country ' s delegation , said there was &quot; a really good atmosphere ( and ) serious negotiations. &quot; Asked whether the talks will succeed , he replied : &quot; It is impossible to tell now. &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher asked the parties to come_to Washington to work_on the proposal after the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization succeeded in stopping the artillery shelling of Bosnia ' s capital , Sarajevo . &quot; This is a very special moment ; we need to build_on the cease-fire and success we ' ve had in Sarajevo , &quot; Christopher told the negotiators Saturday , according to a spokesman . Christopher and his aides believe that a Bosnian-Croatian deal could be the key to an overall peace in Bosnia , because it would strengthen the position of the Muslim-led Bosnian government in negotiations with the Serbs . But the Washington talks must first resolve the basic issue that has already produced a year of bitter combat between Muslims and Croats : Will the Croats of Bosnia live_in a Muslim-majority Bosnian state ? Will they get a separate ministate ? Or will they join the larger republic of Croatia next door ? Croatia ' s president , Franjo Tudjman , has long sought to annex Croat-populated areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina . Many Bosnian Croats also support annexation , but not all do . Bosnia ' s government , which is led by Muslims but also includes some Croats and Serbs , rejects any partition of the republic . The U.S.-backed proposal seeks to solve that dilemma through a complicated , three-step process . First the Muslims and Croats would join to create something diplomats call the &quot; Bosnian Bicommunal Entity , &quot; a federal state with as_many as 10 county-sized &quot; cantons. &quot; The BBE , as negotiators call it for short , would cover about half of Bosnia ' s prewar territory , including Sarajevo . It would have a Muslim majority but strong protection for its Croatian and Serbian minorities . As a second step , the BBE would negotiate peace with the Bosnian Serbs and accept their rule over about half of Bosnia . The Muslim-led government insists that the two halves of the country must_not be divided , but how they would be joined remains unclear . Finally , as a third step , the Muslim-Croat BBE would join neighboring Croatia in an economic union with open borders but would remain a separate country -- roughly the way the countries of Western Europe have joined in the European Union . The Bosnian government has already accepted the basic proposal -- but Croatia has wavered , U.S. officials said . &quot; It is really a moment of choice for Croatia , &quot; one official said . If Croatia supports the proposal , the United States will help mobilize Western economic aid for the Zagreb government , he said . But if Croatia obstructs the U.S.-favored solution , the United States will consider seeking U.N. economic sanctions against the republic . Officials said they expect the discussions to continue all day today and to conclude Monday morning .</TEXT>
