   <TEXT> My house has been sitting on the market for six months . It won ' t sell ; what are my options ? Even in a down market , real_estate experts say that price and condition are the two most important factors_in selling a home . So , the first_step is to lower the price . Also , go_through the house and see if there are cosmetic defects that you missed and can be repaired . Home sellers should make_sure that the home is getting the exposure it deserves through open_houses , broker open_houses , advertising , good signage and a listing on the Multiple Listing Service ( MLS ) . If the seller is using a real_estate_agent and the property isn ' t getting that exposure , find another agent . Another option is to pull the home off the market and wait for overall housing conditions to improve . Finally , frustrated sellers who are forced to sell because of a divorce or financial considerations , could discuss a short_sale or a deed in lieu of a foreclosure with the mortgage lender . But these would be considered more radical options than lowering the price . Other Sources : &quot; How to Sell Your House , Condo , Co-op &quot; by Amy Sprecher Bly and Robert W .
