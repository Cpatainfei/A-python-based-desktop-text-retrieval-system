   <HEADLINE> SKIING / WORLD CUP AT MAMMOTH ; OLYMPIC FAVORITES WIN THIS TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three weeks too late , the Olympic favorites in women ' s super-G crossed the finish_line and took their expected bows on the podium . No one was handing_out medals here Wednesday . Only handshakes , World Cup points and American dollars . Germany ' s Katja Seizinger restored order on the circuit by winning the first post-Olympic super-G with a time of 1 minute 20.07 seconds , a half-second faster than Bibiana Perez of Italy , who finished second . Hilde Gerg , also of Germany , finished third . Seizinger-Perez-Gerg : They might have shared Olympic glory . Seizinger and Perez are the world ' s top two ranked super-G skiers . Gerg ranks sixth . So what happened at Lillehammer ? Seizinger and Perez both crashed , and Gerg , who won the last pre-Olympic World Cup super-G , finished a disappointing 18th . These events helped clear an improbable gold-medal path for the American longshot , Diann Roffe-Steinrotter . Wednesday ' s race at Mammoth went so true_to form that Roffe-Steinrotter skied a very good race and finish 15th . Picabo Street , the Olympic silver medalist in downhill , finished 12th . &quot; We were disappointed in the Olympics , &quot; Seizinger said , speaking on behalf of Perez , whose English isn ' t quite as good . &quot; We met on the slopes at Kvitfjell and talked . You have to risk everything at the Olympics . We raced good until we went_out . It ' s OK , now that we are back. &quot; Seizinger , who avenged her super-G disappointment by claiming the Olympic downhill , is the World Cup leader in both events and is , according to Canada ' s Kerrin Lee-Gartner , &quot; skiing in another league. &quot; Perez , skiing ninth , seized the lead with a time of 1:20.57 , but Seizinger left no doubt when she raced from 14th start position into first . The course at Mammoth , playing host to its first World Cup , held_up well under sunny skies and temperatures in the high 40s . But no one from the back of the pack was about to challenge the leaders . Street , starting 42nd , made the most dramatic leap to finish 12th . Despite not having a top-10 U.S. finisher , the race ranked as a shining moment for Americans . Super-G has been the U.S. women team ' s weakest event , which made Roffe-Steinrotter ' s Olympic gold all_the more stunning . Street completed her first super-G of the season after four washouts and posted a career-best finish . Roffe-Steinrotter , despite finishing 1.63 seconds off the pace , celebrated her highest World Cup placement this season . &quot; I was nervous again , &quot; Roffe-Steinrotter said . &quot; I think that ' s just the way it is for me right now . The adrenaline level is up. &quot; As she had done at Lillehammer , Roffe-Steinrotter started slow but made_up time on the more technical bottom . Unlike Lillehammer , though , she ran_out of course at Mammoth . &quot; I just needed more turns , &quot; she said . &quot; I needed the course to be 10 , 15 seconds longer to be better. &quot; For Street , the result could mark a turning point in her super-G career . &quot; It takes experience , &quot; Street said . &quot; Believe it or not , after going_out so many times , I learned what to expect. &quot; Street was surprised her concentration held_up given the whirlwind that has been her life since winning Olympic silver . &quot; I actually got butterflies when I touched American ground in the plane , &quot; she said . &quot; I almost started crying. &quot; Since , she has been busy sorting through her mail and endorsement possibilities . She said she hopes to use her fame to inspire children . &quot; I ' m hoping to get a spot on the Sesame Street Show , &quot; Street said . World Cup Notes Other American finishes in Wednesday ' s super-G : Shannon Nobis , 23rd ; Hilary Lindh , 25th ; Megan Gerety , 40th ; Heidi Voelker 46th ; Eva Twardokens , 51st , Krista Schmidinger , 54th . . . . Picabo Street will skip today ' s slalom , race in Friday ' s super-G , and then rest for next week ' s downhill at the World Cup_finals at Vail , Colo . She will then return home March 18 for a parade to be held_in her honor in Sun Valley , Idaho . . . . First-place winners this week receive $ 8 # 400 , with $ 4 # 200 for second and $ 1 # 400 for third .</TEXT>
