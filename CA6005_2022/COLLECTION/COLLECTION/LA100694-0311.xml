   <HEADLINE> CSUN ATHLETES ENTER NEW ARENA -- THAT OF POLITICS ; REFERENDUM : AS PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES , THEY STUMP FOR BALLOT MEASURE TO INCREASE STUDENT FEES ; MONIES WOULD BE USED TO UNDERWRITE SCHOOL ' S SPORTS PROGRAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Georgetown , Notre Dame . . . and Cal State Northridge ? It ' s a stretch -- a big stretch -- but school athletic officials hope that if a fee referendum is passed_by student vote Oct . 18-19 , the Northridge name might someday be linked with NCAA powers . But first , there are pressing money matters_to address . And that means student-athletes are spending time pressing palms with students . Milling_about under a tent on campus Wednesday were several Matador athletes , distributing literature and campaigning for the proposal . &quot; I definitely hope it passes , &quot; said Trenton Cross , a member of the men ' s basketball_team . &quot; I ' m only a freshman and I ' m going_to be here a while. &quot; The referendum , if approved , would raise semester fees from $ 4 to $ 49 per student , those monies earmarked for athletics . Monday , the department kicked_off its campaign in_earnest . Cross was one of at least two-dozen athletes who took an afternoon turn_in the tent , pitched just outside athletic department headquarters . The tent was erected Monday and different promotional handbills are being distributed daily . The information contained in the literature isn ' t exactly news to the athletes . Last month , the worst-case scenario associated with the referendum ' s defeat was mapped_out during a meeting with Athletic Director Bob Hiegert . Hiegert said the program , with a budget of $ 3.6 million , stands to lose as much as $ 700 # 000 next year . The fee referendum would generate approximately $ 2.25 million annually and much of the revenue would be used for scholarships . Hiegert said each team -- except the football_team -- would carry the maximum allowable number of scholarships . If the referendum fails , Northridge could be forced to slash programs , including football , and might drop from NCAA Division I to II . &quot; If it passes , the program is in good_shape , &quot; Cross said . &quot; If it doesn ' t , uh-oh. &quot; Athletics officials have emphasized the payoff for students in the campaign , citing free admission to games and association with a school with a national athletics identity . Students who listened to the athletes ' pitch Wednesday seemed receptive -- though there will be a price . &quot; I ' m voting yes , &quot; said Nathan Miller , 21 , of Granada Hills . &quot; I ' ve got a_couple_of more years left , but I think it ' s important to have a football team. &quot; In Miller ' s case , mission accomplished . &quot; We ' re trying to impart that athletics is a recognition thing that is important to everyone , &quot; said Brian Swanson , an associate athletic director charged with running the promotional campaign . &quot; When you say ' Notre Dame , ' you think_of football . You say ' Georgetown , ' you think basketball . Those are solid academic schools , but people generally associate them with their sports programs. &quot; Athletics officials are trying to learn from last semester when a similar referendum was voted_down . A lopsided vote from a satellite campus in Ventura doomed the proposition to defeat . It marked the first time the Ventura campus voted_in a school election , Swanson said . Northridge , which plans to campaign in Ventura , also might offer Ventura students a shuttle service to selected on-campus games as an incentive . Athletes are handling most of the stumping and several already have appeared before campus clubs . Quarterback J.J. O ' Laughlin spoke_to the Surf Club on Tuesday and receiver Duc Ngo is scheduled to speak with the Vietnamese Students Club . Others have been instructed to give informational speeches in their academic classes . Those making speaking appearances are given a handout outlining the details of the referendum and its possible impact . Included in the &quot; script &quot; is a breakdown of what $ 49 buys these days : -- A Saturday night date ; -- Four compact_discs ; -- A new outfit ; -- A big milkshake ( per week ) . The punch_line follows in the form of a question -- Is Northridge athletics worth essentially one milkshake per week to maintain ? Each of the school ' s approximately 325 athletes has been asked to recruit 10 students to vote_in favor of the plan . The request is not exactly voluntary . Each was given a sheet on which to list those students ' names and phone_numbers . Last spring , Swanson said , approximately 2 # 000 of the school ' s 26 # 000 students cast ballots and the referendum lost by fewer than 100 votes . The athletic department is making considerably more noise about the issue this time around . &quot; A lot of the people who stopped by ( the tent ) said they will vote for it this time because they know where the money ' s going , &quot; Swanson said . &quot; I ' m not sure that was the case last time. &quot; Then again , student apathy being what it is , the campaign is something of a calculated risk . Registration each semester already runs $ 958 for state residents enrolled full time . If enough students are aware of the issue and its cost , they might just vote it down . &quot; We talked_about that , &quot; Swanson said . &quot; It comes_down to the fact that it ' s a student program . . . . They need to make the decision. &quot; If the proposal passes , it could be a boon for athletics , which would then use private donations to upgrade facilities . More teams also would be established , Hiegert said .</TEXT>
