   <HEADLINE> ENDING IRAQ SANCTIONS NO PANACEA ; MIDEAST : CITIZENS BLAME EMBARGO FOR WOES . BUT OBSERVERS SAY LIFTING BAN WOULD NOT MEAN SPEEDY IMPROVEMENT IN MOST PEOPLE ' S LIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For four years now , President Saddam Hussein has so successfully fanned the flames of hatred against America that Iraqis instinctively blame the U.S.-led embargo for virtually everything that goes_wrong in their lives -- from a bad clutch to the quality of public education to an inability to put enough food on the table . But even a lifting of sanctions will not improve life appreciably for most Iraqis -- at least not for months and perhaps even years , analysts here say . After the inevitable euphoria accompanying an eventual end of the embargo fades , how will the Iraqis express their frustrations ? Will their anger rivet on some new , more convenient scapegoat , perhaps closer to home ? Might that target be Hussein himself ? Some diplomats have been pondering these questions since the issue of sanctions against Iraq was thrust onto center stage by Hussein ' s recent , ominous deployment of his army near the Kuwaiti border , followed by a withdrawal . Certainly no one expects an immediate popular uprising when and if the embargo ends . But such questions underscore a growing recognition that it will be a long_haul before most Iraqis can reclaim a lifestyle to which they had once grown accustomed , now only a distant memory . And Hussein ' s promotion of a lifting of sanctions as a panacea for Iraq ' s worries could come_back to haunt him , diplomats said . &quot; It will not be a very fast recovery , &quot; a top Turkish official said here Wednesday . &quot; Things will get_better only gradually -- perhaps months , maybe a year or more. &quot; For one thing , Iraq has about $ 100 billion in debts and far more to pay in war reparations . &quot; What will be left ( after the debts are paid ) will not be very much , &quot; noted the official . Iraq intends to pay its debts with proceeds from renewed oil sales , but its daily production is down to about 650 # 000 barrels . Given the deterioration in Iraq ' s oil-industry infrastructure , it is questionable that production levels can quickly regain the pre-Gulf War level of 3 million to 8 million barrels a day . It may take months to begin producing even 1 million barrels a day , one analyst said . Moreover , with new oil entering the market , prices could drop , thus cutting_into Iraq ' s oil revenues . &quot; There ' s no way they can quickly fulfill those promises ( of debt payment ) , &quot; the analyst noted . Some observers fear things could deteriorate further before they get better -- even with an end to sanctions . &quot; Everything here -- the telephone_system , electricity , sewage -- has been rebuilt , but it ' s all temporary , mostly done with old and faulty spare_parts that could collapse any day , &quot; said a European diplomat , a Baghdad veteran . &quot; The spare_parts -- there ' s very little in any sector now , &quot; added a Russian official . And there have been scattered reports of looting of government food storage centers in several parts of Iraq , according to diplomats . &quot; The situation is not explosive , but ( such incidents ) are small signs of how awful conditions are , &quot; one Western official said . And there are now reports that the recent harvests are far less bountiful than official government reports say , according to Iraq watchers . Indeed , as if preparing Iraq ' s 18 million citizens for even harsher days ahead , Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Saleh conceded recently that the next six months &quot; definitely will be more difficult for the people . . . . They will sell more of their belongings. &quot; One Arab businessman confided : &quot; Many Iraqi women I know already have sold all their jewelry , and I know of families that have even sold their homes. &quot; There could be a quick post-embargo improvement in supplies of food and medicine if Iraqi officials assign both a high priority , observers say . &quot; But not if they allocate the funds for other purposes , &quot; said a senior diplomat from a neighboring country , referring to the current boom in government construction of mosques as well as a suspected rearming of the Iraqi military . Saleh vehemently denied that Iraq is rearming , but Iraqi officials do not dispute the urgent need to improve such basic amenities as water quality and sewage treatment . For instance , Baghdad Mayor Qaid Hussein Awadi announced Wednesday that Hussein has allocated money to upgrade water purification in this teeming metropolis of 7 million . &quot; Everything will depend_on the priorities of the government . . . , &quot; one analyst concluded Wednesday . &quot; For perhaps another year , there ' s no danger of mass starvation . The Iraqis are surviving. &quot;</TEXT>
