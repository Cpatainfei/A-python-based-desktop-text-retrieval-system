   <HEADLINE> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY ; COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; HARDING AT OPENING CEREMONY A QUESTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Until further notice , figure skater Tonya Harding has all_the rights and privileges of any other member of the U.S. team for the 1994 Winter_Olympics , including an invitation to participate in Saturday ' s opening ceremony . &quot; Oh yeah , she ' s a team member , &quot; said Harvey Schiller , U.S. Olympic Committee executive_director , Sunday , one day after announcing that an administrative board might meet within the next two weeks to determine whether Harding can compete in the Games . &quot; Nothing has changed in_regard_to that. &quot; Schiller added he does not expect Harding to arrive in Lillehammer until the middle of next week , but he said no firm date has been set for her travel . And other USOC officials emphasized that she is almost predictably unpredictable . &quot; I don ' t think she ' ll be here , from what I hear , &quot; said one official , who did not want to be identified . &quot; She ' ll have to surprise us . But she ' s done that before. &quot; Harding has time reserved at the rink where she trains in Portland , Ore. , through Friday , but she said during the national championships last month in Detroit , where she earned an Olympic berth by finishing first , that she looked_forward to marching in both the opening and closing ceremonies . Not only did she miss the opening ceremony for the 1992 Winter_Olympics in Albertville , France , she did not arrive until two days before her competition started , giving herself little time to adjust to changes in time and climate . One year after winning the silver medal in the World Championships , she finished a disappointing fourth . &quot; It ' s going_to be more fun this time , &quot; she said last month . &quot; I ' m going_to do the opening and closing ceremonies . It ' s an experience I should have seen the first time . I realize that was wrong . I ' m going_to take every opportunity I can. &quot; * If Michelle Kwan of Torrance is called_upon to compete as a replacement for Harding , she will be the first alternate to represent the United States in Olympic figure_skating since 1932 . Maribel Vinson and George Hill withdrew from the pairs competition when Harvard would not allow Hill to take_time_off from classes because he was_on academic probation . They were replaced by Gertrude Meredith and Joseph Savage , who finished last . Savage also served as the chief referee of the speedskating competition . He was 52 , the oldest_person to compete for the United States in the Winter_Olympics . Kwan , 13 , would be the youngest . * Since the U.S. figure_skating championships in Detroit , enrollment in the Lake Arrowhead Ice Castle International Training Center ' s Learn to Skate Program has increased 400 % . &quot; Who knows whether it ' s because it ' s an Olympic year or because of this ? &quot; said Frank Carroll , who coaches Kwan at the Ice Castle . This , of course , is the worldwide publicity surrounding Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan . &quot; Maybe ( our students ) had better take martial_arts and figure_skating at_the_same_time , &quot; Carroll said . * With the IOC ' s announcement that no new members will be named at this week ' s session , the United States has gone 2 1 / 2 years with only one representative , Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles . Although she is recognized as one of the IOC ' s most effective members , she insists that she cannot do the job alone , particularly with Salt_Lake_City ' s campaign for the 2002 Winter_Olympics coming_to a head next year . The IOC has promised that she will have a U.S. colleague by the end of the summer . * Among the official delegation from the U.S._government to Saturday ' s opening ceremony will be Dawn Steel , who produced &quot; Cool Runnings , &quot; a movie about the Jamaican bobsled team . The International Society of Olympic Historians called it &quot; a movie of bad Olympic history. &quot; &quot; I would not for a minute expect any ISOH members to respect it at all for its flagrant lack of respect for many things Olympic and the liberties it takes with the true story line , &quot; society secretary_general , Bill Mallon , wrote in the ISOH Journal . &quot; Having said all_of the above , &quot; he continued , &quot; I really enjoyed the movie. &quot;</TEXT>
