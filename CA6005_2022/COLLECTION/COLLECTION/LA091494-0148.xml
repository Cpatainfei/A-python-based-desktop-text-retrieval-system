   <HEADLINE> FISCAL WOES PLAGUE CSUN ATHLETICS ; FUNDING : PROPOSED REFERENDUM SEEKS ADDITIONAL $ 49 PER STUDENT PER SEMESTER TO OFFSET SHRINKING BUDGET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The future of Cal State Northridge athletics may be tied to the most superfluous of sports-related events -- the election of the homecoming court . The athletics department Tuesday sought to place a referendum on the homecoming-election ballot Oct . 18-19 that ultimately could decide whether the school continues to compete at the NCAA Division I level . If the funding referendum fails , cuts_in the department could result in the elimination of several programs , including football . Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert , who outlined the proposal to the Associated Students ' Senate on Tuesday , says the department -- already funded at a_level below many of its Division I counterparts -- is not understating the_matter . &quot; If we ' re not funded , we ' re going backwards , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; We ' re certainly not crying wolf. &quot; Northridge is faced with losing as much as $ 700 # 000 from its 1995-96 athletics budget . This year ' s budget is $ 3.6 million . The department is asking students to consider paying an additional $ 49 each semester in Associated Students ' fees to generate funds that would underwrite sports programs . Since 1985 , the athletics department has received $ 4 per semester from each student . Based on the enrollment level of 24 # 000 , the fee hike would generate $ 2.25 million annually for Matador sports . Hiegert expects to learn by next week whether the referendum will be included on the homecoming ballot . Passage could result in more athletic scholarships and the establishment of additional programs . Over the past three years , declining enrollment and decreases in funding from school sources have resulted in a departmental decrease of $ 335 # 000 . Also , state funding has dropped $ 200 # 000 over the same period . The University Corporation , which oversees many of the school ' s financial resources , is strapped because of costs associated with earthquake damage and reduced its athletic funding from $ 430 # 000 in 1993-94 to $ 225 # 000 this year . The foundation isn ' t expected to fund athletics at all next year , Hiegert said . The athletic department could face a series of difficult decisions if the referendum fails -- and history isn ' t exactly on the athletes ' side . A similar proposal presented to students last spring lost by 87 votes . If the October referendum is again shot down , the school might eliminate programs to trim costs , including the Division I-AA football_team . &quot; I ' d say that if there is a quick_fix , that is probably the quickest to do , &quot; Hiegert said . What ' s more , if the referendum fails and departmental projections are accurate , elimination of programs might force the school to return to the Division II level . The NCAA requires schools to field 14 teams in_order to maintain Division I status . Currently , Northridge fields 16 sports recognized at the Division I level . Northridge ' s decision to move to Division I seven years ago was in part tied to long-range enrollment projections that have fallen well short of the mark . Estimates made in the late 1980s indicated the school would have an enrollment of 40 # 000 by the year 2000 . In reality , the recession and earthquake have sent the student population spiraling downward . Enrollment has tumbled this semester to 24 # 000 , down from the late ' 80s high-water_mark of 31 # 000 , and the department has felt the financial pinch . More athletics costs loom : California State University gender-equity bylaws require member schools to field the same number of teams and supply an equal number of scholarships in men ' s and women ' s sports by 1998-99 . In an attempt to elicit support for the referendum , Northridge officials are accentuating the payoff for students as well as student-athletes if the proposal is approved : Excluding football , scholarships for Northridge programs would be raised to the NCAA maximum , making teams more competitive across the board . * At least two women ' s sports would be added in accordance with gender-equity requirements . Women ' s soccer could be added as soon as next fall , Hiegert said . * Also , students would avoid paying admission_fees for future athletic events . Students with a valid activities card currently are admitted free .</TEXT>
