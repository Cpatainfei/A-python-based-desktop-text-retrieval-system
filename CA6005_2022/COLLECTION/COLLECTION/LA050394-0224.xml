   <HEADLINE> STRIKE CRIPPLES SERVICES AT SCHOOLS IN O.C. ; LABOR : TRANSPORTATION AND CHILD_CARE ARE SNARLED AS 400 ORANGE DISTRICT EMPLOYEES LEAVE JOBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 400 non-teaching employees of the Orange Unified School District staged a first-ever strike Monday , crippling after-class child-care and bus_service so that hundreds of parents had no choice but to pick_up their children from school . Of the district ' s 26 # 000 students , about 7 # 000 depend_on bus_service . But on Monday , only about 10 of 71 buses operated during the day , although union and district officials dispute the exact number . What buses remained were restricted to special_education students , which forced hundreds of angry parents to wind through jammed parking_lots , past dozens of union pickets , at each of the district ' s 37 schools . The district serves areas of Orange , Villa Park , Anaheim , Garden Grove , Silverado and Santa Ana . &quot; It took damn near a half-hour to get_in and out of this parking_lot this morning , &quot; said Don Patterson , looking_out at the backed-up parking_lot at the Crescent Elementary and Intermediate schools , which his two children attend . &quot; It ' s just been chaos . . . . The Orange Unified District is screwed up. &quot; The walkout was staged by the district ' s classified employees union , whose ranks include bus_drivers and maintenance , food service and clerical workers . The workers have not had a pay raise since 1988 , and took a 2.59 % pay_cut last year . Monday ' s job action was the first strike to hit Orange Unified since a six-day teachers ' walkout in the spring of 1988 . Classified workers also threatened to strike that year over health benefits , but stopped short of walking_out . With exact numbers in_dispute , Monday ' s strike also appears to have shut_down more_than half of the district ' s 24 child-care centers . Dave Geer left his towing company about 1:30 p.m. to retrieve his second- and sixth-grade daughters , who go_to the Crescent schools . &quot; This is a big inconvenience , &quot; said Geer , who will try to arrange a car pool with other parents during the strike . &quot; I just don ' t think it ' s fair that kids should have to suffer because the adults can ' t settle things. &quot; There seemed little hope Monday that the stand-off between representatives of the California School Employees Assn. , Chapter 67 , and district officials would be resolved soon . The union represents 1 # 160 workers , but only about 600 are dues-paying members . Union officials pledged Monday to stay_on strike as long as necessary to pressure the district into renegotiating a contract that cuts health benefits , imposes furloughs and empowers the district to lay off and reduce the hours of workers without notice . Union leaders have denounced the contract , which went_into effect April 10 , as &quot; union-busting. &quot; &quot; We will be out until we get this resolved , &quot; union President Becky Mayers said . &quot; I guess we need to show them we are essential employees after all. &quot; On the other hand , district officials maintain that contract negotiations with the union are over , and vow that schools will remain open during the strike . The district is urging parents to arrange for their children ' s transportation and not to rely_on school child_care during the strike . The district has established a strike hot_line for parents to call . The number is ( 714 ) 532-6987 . District officials conceded that the strike caused logistic and administrative headaches Monday , but said classrooms experienced few if any substantial disruptions . &quot; The kids are in class and that is our No . 1 priority , &quot; said Assistant Supt . Gretchen Hanson , who assumed duties of superintendent Friday . &quot; The school_system is functioning fine because this is not a classroom strike. &quot; District officials defended their decision not to reopen contract talks with union_representatives Monday . They said the contract saves the district $ 485 # 000 and is crucial in offsetting a $ 2.2-million shortfall in its $ 107-million budget this year . &quot; We are not negotiating , &quot; said Jack Elsner , head of district ' s personnel_department . &quot; The board ' s position is firm on that. &quot; District officials , however , said Monday that they are willing to discuss charges of unfair labor practices recently leveled by union officials . The district has denied charges of unfair negotiating during nearly a year of talks . Union President Mayers said workers have refused to sign the contract that district officials have offered : &quot; What we object to is that ( the district board ) implemented their proposal . They think it ' s a contract , and we don ' t . It ' s a proposal. &quot; &quot; We are willing to resolve the charges , &quot; said Elsner . &quot; But we have to have something specific and concrete to work with. &quot; Union_members voted 338-50 on April 7 to authorize leaders to call_for a job action . The strike on Monday followed a sickout last Tuesday in which an estimated 900 workers called_in ill . Monday ' s walkout was triggered by a canceled meeting Friday with district officials regarding the unfair labor practices . In addition to the anger over the contract , union workers who picketed throughout the district Monday explained that they went_on strike because they were directed to take three mandatory furlough days and a cut_in benefits . The contract deducts up_to $ 80 per paycheck in some cases for workers to maintain their current level of health coverage . &quot; We aren ' t asking_for more , we are just trying to keep what we have , &quot; said Don Davis , a district maintenance worker for 35 years . Francis Baker , a district secretary for 16 years , agreed . &quot; This was a terrible decision to have to make , we have never been out on strike before , &quot; she said . &quot; But this contract is really hitting our pocket books hard. &quot; A pivotal issue for union_representatives is a contract clause that gives the school district authority to lay off union employees or cut their hours without notice . Union officials fear the district will try to save on health benefits by laying_off full-time employees and hiring part-time workers to replace them . &quot; If we don ' t fight over this this year , &quot; Mayers said , &quot; there won ' t be anything to fight over next year. &quot; But school officials say union fears that the district will use the clause to arbitrarily dismiss workers are exaggerated . &quot; that ' s not the intent , &quot; board President Maureen Aschoff asserted . Aschoff said the clause gives the board &quot; more flexibility &quot; in resolving future budget shortfalls and would allow the district to avoid imposing layoffs by reducing workers ' hours instead . &quot; It ' s really an advantage for them , &quot; said Aschoff . &quot; But I know they have a different perspective. &quot; Monday ' s strike piqued the moral conscience of many teachers and principals , who grappled with crossing picket_lines . Dave Reger , president of the teachers union , sacrificed a day ' s wage Monday to honor the lines . &quot; It ' s a matter of conscience , &quot; said Reger , who joined a knot of pickets in front of district headquarters Monday morning . &quot; I believe_in the union concept . I won ' t cross the line. &quot; But most teachers and principals reluctantly crossed picket_lines . &quot; It ' s a hard thing to see employees on the street and you have to cross their lines to get_in to the job you have to do , &quot; said Cheryl Cohen , principal at Crescent Intermediate . Also , because of the strike , many school cafeterias experienced delays in serving food , which was cold Monday , rather than hot . For some students it was an unwelcome change . &quot; They usually don ' t have such good food regularly , &quot; said David Aminzadeh , a fifth-grader at Crescent Intermediate . &quot; But the sub sandwiches today were terrible , so hardly anybody bought them . &quot; I went hungry , &quot; added the 10-year-old .</TEXT>
