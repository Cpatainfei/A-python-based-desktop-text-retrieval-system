   <HEADLINE> SOUTH_KOREA SAYS SLIM CHANCE HACKER STOLE NUCLEAR SECRETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The South_Korean atomic_energy institute said Friday that there is a slim possibility a teen-age British computer hacker stole secret nuclear data from its computer_system . The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute , or KAERI , said it was investigating possible damage to its system after a report in the Washington Times newspaper Thursday that said the hacker managed to access it recently . The Times report quoted James Christy , director of computer crime investigation at the U.S. Air_Force ' s office of special investigations . He spoke at a conference on global organized crime convened by Washington ' s Center for Strategic and International Studies . Christy said the 16-year-old youth using the name Data Stream got_into the system and more_than 100 others after penetrating the computer at the Rome Air Development Center at Griffith Air_Force Base in Rome , N.Y. The report said British police found the boy , who was not identified , sitting in front of his computer_screen when they raided his house , and he curled_up into a fetal position and cried when he realized they had come_to arrest him . South_Korean media quoted KAERI officials as saying there is a good chance a hacker could have infiltrated its system because it was connected to the worldwide Internet . However , the officials said confidential_information such_as that on reactor systems and fuel rod design was stored separately from other data and protected by multiple passwords .</TEXT>
