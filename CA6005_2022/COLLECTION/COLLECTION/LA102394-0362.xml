   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' CASE LENIENCY IS OUT IN O.C. ; COURTS : PROSECUTORS TIGHTEN UP POLICY OF SOMETIMES IGNORING PRIOR CONVICTIONS IF LATEST CRIME WASN ' T VIOLENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A petty thief with a long criminal history , Jesus A . Martinez was arrested in July at a Fullerton HomeBase , a wrench , some pliers and a pair of vice grips tucked_in his waistband , police said . The value of the items allegedly stolen : $ 42.52. But if prosecutors have their way , it will cost the 44-year-old man much , much more . Possibly the rest of his life . Martinez is among the first 94 defendants charged in Orange County under &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation , a new law that aims to punish repeat offenders with lengthier prison_terms . If found guilty at trial next month , Martinez , who has prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and burglary , faces 25 years to life in prison -- a harsher sentence than some murderers get . The new sentencing law is the legacy of Polly Klaas , a Petaluma 12-year-old who was kidnaped and murdered late last year , authorities contend , by a newly paroled career criminal . The case sparked a public outcry over the criminal justice system ' s seeming inability to keep habitual offenders behind bars , and prompted the state Legislature to resurrect a bill that mandates life sentences for third-time felons who have two or more convictions for serious or violent crimes . Promising it would help make California residents safer from violent criminals , Gov . Pete Wilson signed the bill in March , and an initiative -- Proposition 184 -- on the November general_election ballot seeks to make &quot; three strikes &quot; part of the state Constitution . In Orange County , however , the new law has thus far ensnared mainly drug_users and burglars , underscoring the complaints of critics who say that the law targets the wrong defendants , threatens to create a logjam in the courts and will possibly bankrupt the state by forcing an unprecedented prison-building program . Of the 94 men and women charged under the new law , fewer than 20 face new felony charges for crimes of violence , according to a list of &quot; three strikes &quot; defendants compiled by the Orange County district_attorney ' s office . But Orange County ' s cases also illustrate the argument advanced by supporters of the law : The majority of the defendants have prior convictions for crimes involving force or fear or face a third &quot; strike &quot; for a violent crime . The full impact of the legislation has not yet been felt in Orange County , where only two defendants have been convicted and await sentencing under the new law . But a 35 % to 50 % increase in jury trials scheduled for Superior_Court this year has been attributed largely to the new law , and some fear that &quot; three strikes &quot; ultimately could cost Orange County taxpayers millions of dollars in expanded jail space , additional jury trials , more intensive investigation by law_enforcement and other services . The public_defender ' s office has already asked the county for $ 576 # 000 to handle the fallout . In the meantime , some &quot; three strikes &quot; defendants have found an unlikely ally -- the Orange County district_attorney ' s office . In preparing felony complaints against 10 of the 94 &quot; three strikes &quot; defendants charged so far , prosecutors have simply ignored one of the two prior convictions of the defendants , making them second- instead of third-strikers , and effectively sparing them the threat of a life sentence . Some who benefited from this prosecutorial mercy had violent backgrounds , such_as South County ex-convict Michael Marano , who once robbed a 71-year-old woman at knifepoint and was charged with battering his own mother . Assistant Dist . Atty . Jan Nolan said prosecutors have since tightened_up their policies regarding &quot; three strikes &quot; cases , and she acknowledged that prosecutors should have sought the harshest punishment against Marano . Nolan blamed the error on a gradually evolving policy , but noted that such discretion has been used in only about 10 % of the &quot; three strikes &quot; cases . As did the often-ignored 1982 habitual offender statute , the new law counts as &quot; strikes &quot; prior convictions for certain serious or violent crimes , ranging from residential burglary to murder . Defendants with one &quot; strike &quot; against them face prison_terms for their most recent felony that are double the ordinary minimum sentences . And those with two &quot; strikes &quot; face 25 years to life in prison when convicted of a third felony -- any felony , even petty theft . Of the 94 men and women charged under the new law , only 18 face new felony charges for crimes of violence involving force or fear . Eleven of those 18 defendants are accused of robberies , and the remaining seven have been charged with crimes ranging from assault to sex crimes to making threats . The remaining 76 defendants were charged with nonviolent felonies : 34 for drugs , 22 for burglaries and the rest for crimes including petty theft , receiving stolen property , illegal firearms possession and forgery . But 50 of these 76 have prior &quot; strikes &quot; for violent crimes . One was convicted of murder in Los Angeles in 1975 , two have prior convictions for voluntary manslaughter , and the rest have have been convicted of a range of crimes that include kidnaping , robbery and sexual_assault . To supporters of the new law , such numbers are evidence that it is ensnaring violent , hard-core criminals , who have repeatedly demonstrated their intent to continue breaking the law . &quot; I don ' t think you can just look_at the charge the guy is facing now . You have to look_at his background , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Michael Jacobs , who compiles &quot; three strikes &quot; statistics for the district_attorney ' s office . Nolan said prosecutors were still trying to grapple with how the new law would be applied when the Felony Evaluation Committee -- a panel of high-ranking prosecutors who review felony cases -- decided not to seek the harshest sentences against at least 10 of the &quot; three strikes &quot; candidates because their newest cases were relatively minor . Nine of them faced drug charges , and one was charged with stealing a paint sprayer that was later returned , according to court records . But even Nolan concedes that , in hindsight , Michael Marano seems an unlikely candidate for a prosecutorial reprieve . &quot; I can tell you unequivocally , that now , that case would not again be filed as a ' two strikes ' case , &quot; Nolan said . As a teen , Marano , who is now 29 , was charged with assaulting his mother . At age 20 , he robbed a 71-year-old convenience_store clerk at knifepoint while she begged for her life , and then went_on to help a co-defendant rob a gas_station . He was still on parole for those 1985 convictions when he embarked_on a crime spree that included a bank heist , holding_up the same gas_station twice and stealing $ 400 from a former neighbor . On parole for the second spate of crimes , he was arrested in Dana Point in May for smoking marijuana and possessing methamphetamines for_sale , making him eligible for 25 years to life in prison . But prosecutors used their discretion to ignore one of Marano ' s prior convictions , and Marano has since been sentenced to four years in prison . Nolan said the district_attorney ' s policy has since changed to more closely reflect the intent of the law -- to get repeat offenders off the street , regardless of the latest charge on which they have been arrested . &quot; We are going_to be very stringent ( now ) in what we knock_down &quot; or reduce , Nolan said . &quot; Instead of the ( current ) crime , the background is going_to weigh more heavily. &quot; Defense_attorneys contend that the district_attorney ' s evolving policy about how to apply the &quot; three strikes &quot; law has already resulted in unequal justice . Take these two unrelated cases , both titled People vs . Garcia . John Garcia was arrested in May on felony charges of possessing cocaine and heroin , and misdemeanor charges involving possession of a hypodermic_syringe . Court records show that Garcia has been convicted of four burglaries and a robbery since 1986 . But prosecutors reviewing his background and the pending case against him agreed to &quot; strike a strike , &quot; as the process is referred to in legal circles . Garcia , 32 , entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors and was sentenced to 32 months in prison , according to court records and prosecutors ' own data . David John Garcia , in the other case , should be so lucky . David Garcia , 31 , also was arrested for possessing heroin . And according to documents filed by prosecutors , he has three prior burglary convictions and one prior conviction for receiving stolen property . Yet prosecutors are seeking a 25-years-to-life sentence in his case . &quot; I just don ' t understand how they decided one should be a ' three strikes ' case , and the other shouldn ' t , &quot; said Deputy Public_Defender Joel Garson , who was appointed to represent both Garcias . &quot; One of the purposes of our legal_system is to make_sure laws are applied equally and there is uniformity in sentencing . I don ' t see that happening here. &quot; Rod Rimmer , executive_director of the citizen group that placed the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative on the November ballot , said prosecutors should use their discretion to waive a prior &quot; strike &quot; only in &quot; very rare &quot; cases . &quot; If the district_attorney does not use that discretion wisely , it is up_to society to replace him with someone that will , &quot; Rimmer said . Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) , who is campaigning for reelection and an ardent supporter of &quot; three strikes , &quot; said he too believes &quot; three strikes &quot; charges should be filed_in almost every case possible . But Pringle said he believes Orange County prosecutors are doing their best with a new law and using their discretion wisely . &quot; I don ' t think any felony is minor , so I believe they all should be filed as ' three strikes , ' &quot; Pringle said . &quot; But I trust our prosecutors in Orange County to make the right calls . I would not second-guess that at all. &quot; Meanwhile , a legal debate is raging over whether judges have the same discretion to ignore prior convictions -- a debate that can only be settled by a higher_court . But some judges say they feel trapped in a Catch-22 situation . Prosecutors are filing &quot; three strikes &quot; charges in nearly all cases -- a practice that protects them from criticism and shifts the burden of dispensing justice to judges . &quot; No one wants to be seen as being soft_on crime . But clearly , there are people being charged who do not deserve 25 years to life in prison , &quot; said one judge , who spoke on condition that he not be identified . In a handful of cases , some Orange County judges have acted to spare defendants a life sentence by ignoring a prior conviction or reducing a felony charge to a misdemeanor , which means the defendant cannot be sent to prison . Orange County Superior_Court Judge Anthony J . Rackauckas Jr . recently reduced a felony check fraud charge to a misdemeanor in the case of a man with two prior burglary convictions . Prosecutors may appeal . West Orange County Municipal Court Judge Dan C . Dutcher ruled a_few months ago that prosecutors had insufficient evidence to prove a felony stalking charge . The man was ultimately convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse and sentenced to jail , and Dutcher ' s opponent in the upcoming election has criticized the judge ' s action in the case . &quot; It ' s not fair , &quot; Dutcher said of the criticism . &quot; But we are elected to the bench to make difficult decisions. &quot; Only two people have been convicted so far of charges that could put them away for life -- a twice-convicted burglar who struck_out when he stole a car , and a twice-convicted robber and prostitute who was caught with cocaine in a motel_room . Both await sentencing and it remains to be seen whether judges in those cases will mete_out the harsh punishment . Many Orange County Superior_Court judges were reluctant to air their private views on &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation . Some said privately they would not hesitate to strike_down enforcement of the law if necessary . But others , such_as Orange County Superior_Court Judge James A . Jackman , say they believe their hands are tied by the new law . &quot; Cases involving some guy who breaks_into a woman ' s house and rapes her , someone who preys on small children -- those cases aren ' t difficult , &quot; Jackman said . &quot; I live_in fear of sentencing someone to ( 25 years to life in prison ) for much less. &quot; Presiding Orange County Superior_Court Judge James L . Smith said it will probably be months before the full impact of the law can be calculated . But he said criminal trials are already up 35 % to 40 % , an increase he attributes at least in part to the &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation . While most cases in the criminal justice system are resolved through plea negotiations , defendants are beginning to show a reluctance to enter guilty pleas , lest they rack_up a first or second &quot; strike. &quot; In &quot; third-strike &quot; cases , they feel they might as well roll the dice on a jury trial , since there is always a chance of winning an acquittal . &quot; I would say all_of these defendants will demand a trial , &quot; Smith said . &quot; If they have nothing to lose , why not ? &quot; During 1993 , there were 321 jury and non-jury trials held_in Orange County Superior_Court . During the first seven months of the year , 201 trials were held , which means the monthly trial average is already rising . Nolan said she believes trial settings are soaring even higher , near the 50 % mark . She said her office is starting to feel the crunch and the growing caseloads have meant that even high-ranking prosecutors -- herself included -- will be handling &quot; three strikes &quot; cases in the courtroom . &quot; We have more cases , but we don ' t have any more prosecutors , &quot; she said . Smith said he has a contingency plan in place , and is prepared to order civil court judges to switch to criminal cases if needed . But judges like John J . Ryan say they do not anticipate a crisis situation . Many of the cases will involve trials lasting only two or three days , and he and other judges are prepared to handle back-to-back trials as long as it takes . &quot; It is the law and we are here to make_sure it is carried_out , &quot; Ryan said . &quot; Three Strikes &quot; File Gov . Pete Wilson in March signed emergency legislation that sends repeat criminals to prison for 25 years to life -- a harsher sentence than some murderers face . The law is also on the November ballot .
