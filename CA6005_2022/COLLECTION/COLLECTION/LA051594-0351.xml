   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : EAST : EAST LOS ANGELES ; CLASSES HELP REPAIR FAMILY PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Licensed marriage , family and child counselor Elise Nickel hadn ' t been in a classroom for 10 years and knew she needed to learn more ways to tackle family problems , &quot; not only for my own children but for the parents that I counsel. &quot; So she enrolled in Saturday classes in Cal State Los Angeles ' Parent Educator Certificate Program and was one of its first eight graduates April 21 . Nickel said the classes helped her learn about the stress a family experiences with a developmentally disabled child , the strong bonds of gang members and the problems pregnant teens face . &quot; I had a lot of experiences that I would n ' t have had any other place , &quot; she said . The Parent Educator Certificate Program , offered through the university ' s Continuing Education Program , is open_to anyone with a minimum of an associate_degree , and targets professionals in nursing , teaching , religion and family therapy , said program coordinator Linda Hahn . Parenting classes are not required to be taught by certified professionals , she said , but that may change as the demand for qualified teachers in the field increases . Most of those who graduated April 21 work with families as teachers , social_workers , therapists and law-enforcement officers , said teacher and counselor Martha Serrano-Lujan . She works_at the East Los Angeles Systems of Care_for the Mental Health Department , focusing_on children with developmental disabilities . A former marriage encounter teacher , Serrano-Lujan emphasized the importance of keeping the marriage intact to best help the children through tough times . &quot; Parents come_apart at the seams and don ' t know how to deal with ( problems ) , not only with the child , but with themselves , &quot; she said . When a child gets_in trouble , parents often are left wondering what happened and find themselves at_odds trying to solve the problem . &quot; The problem is that they ' re not communicating , &quot; Serrano-Lujan said . &quot; One of the core areas we teach is ( the importance of ) communication between the parents. &quot; She said parents need to become aware that children sometimes pit one parent against the other , and that a united front works better than if the parents are in_disagreement . Serrano-Lujan believes the stigma of families seeking help has faded somewhat , leaving the door open_to better understanding . &quot; A lot of parents end_up divorced . Some parents need the support to know that they are not alone , &quot; she said . Classes in the program start every fall and spring and take 1 1 / 2 years to complete . An informational meeting for the fall quarter is scheduled Sept . 10 . Tuition varies , but one class , Family Dynamics and Parenting , costs $ 364 . Scholarships are available . Cal State Los Angeles is at 5151 State University Drive . Information : ( 213 ) 343-5964 . MARY ANNE PEREZ</TEXT>
