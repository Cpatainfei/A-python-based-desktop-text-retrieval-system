   <TEXT> With Washington in turmoil and his party racked with post-election anguish , President Clinton ' s trip to distant Indonesia this week might seem a masterpiece of ill timing . It might , except that its chief subject , trade , has gradually emerged as one of the strongest elements in his foreign_policy -- and one that figures to be even more vital to him politically in the next two years . As health_care reform has come unstrung and some_other parts of his domestic agenda have bogged down , Clinton and his economic team have ground_out a string of large and small wins on trade and laid the groundwork for others . Last week ' s Democratic electoral rout promises to give trade even more prominence for the embattled President as one enterprise he can pursue partly without congressional assent . To date , the Administration has successfully pushed passage of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , increased government promotion of U.S. exports , advanced some regional economic initiatives and generally raised the diplomatic prominence of trade issues . If December brings the congressional adoption of the massive General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , Clinton will have grounds for some serious boasting . Indeed , some experts say trade is the one area of clarity and resolve in a foreign_policy that has often been fogbound . In this eight-day trip , Clinton hopes to push the transpacific trade group called the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to a general timetable for free_trade . And next month he will head to Miami to talk to Latin_American leaders about trade liberalization at the Summit of the Americas . Clinton has been championing the notion of the big payoff from greater trade since his campaign days : It was , in fact , the fifth paragraph of his campaign announcement speech in the fall of 1991 . Now it is routinely referred to in speeches as a wellspring of hope in an American future that otherwise looks all too bleak . His trade strategy , he said last week at Georgetown University , is a &quot; strategy to help every American family , every American worker . . . from the worldwide growth and prosperity it will bring. &quot; All this is fraught with irony . In 1992 , Clinton built his challenge to President George_Bush ' s foreign_policy around assertions that Bush was not wary enough on NAFTA , was too cozy with the Chinese and was a pushover in the face of the Japanese trade juggernaut . Now when trade issues clash with other concerns , the others give_way . The Administration decontrolled high-technology exports in 1993 -- in a big boost for California -- though the Pentagon feared the move could put sophisticated weapons in dangerous hands . It renewed most-favored-nation trading status for China last May , despite the objections of human-rights advocates . In Monday ' s meeting between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin , trade and North_Korea topped the agenda , while human_rights was again present but secondary . &quot; They stuck_to the strategic elements of our relationship , &quot; as one senior Administration official put it . Clinton arrived in Jakarta on Sunday as some East Timor dissidents were demonstrating , and others rioting , to publicize their complaints of Indonesian government oppression . But while Clinton has carefully assured the world that in Wednesday ' s meeting with Indonesian President Suharto he will discuss human_rights , it was also clear that he does not want these concerns to derail the economic summit or relations with the world ' s fourth-largest nation . Another irony lies_in the fact that the most immediate beneficiary of all these efforts -- American business -- has remained stubbornly resistant to Clinton ' s efforts to win its approval . &quot; This Administration has bent over backwards for business on trade : NAFTA , big tax_breaks , export promotion , you name it , &quot; said one aide . But the response from business is only bitter rejection , he added . Some analysts believe that if the Republicans continue their gradual drift toward protectionism , Clinton could actually begin capturing some of their supporters because of his trade-opening efforts . But that has yet to happen . And while he hasn ' t won business over , his free-trade tilt has caused plenty of problems with his core constituency of labor , as well as countless non-unionized workers who see open borders as a threat to their jobs , their future and their children ' s future . Clinton recognizes how hard it is to sell the blessings of freer_trade to nervous American workers . &quot; For too many of our people , trade appears to be a gale-force wind , just another threat ready to blow away the prospects of a stable job at a good wage , &quot; the President said Thursday . These days , he ' s crowing about how the North_American trade pact boosted exports to Mexico 20 % in the first six months after it was passed , creating as_many as 100 # 000 jobs . And he ' s insisting that trade efforts must be coupled with efforts to help American workers compete in the new economy . But now , as Administration officials and free-trade advocates say the need for liberalization is becoming more important , polls show public support is declining . And the opposition of workers could become truly brutal if the economy went_into a tailspin and the outside world suddenly seemed even more threatening . Though Bush worked hard for NAFTA , Clinton has clearly pushed harder on trade generally . Bush had the patrician Republican ' s belief in the benefits of open trade , but he wasn ' t as eager to use government to make_it happen . In some ways , it may be easier for Clinton to push formation of new trade groups . His advocacy will not bring the same fierce opposition from human_rights and environmental groups that a Republican ' s effort would have engendered . Indeed , some analysts argue that Bush could never have rounded_up the more_than 100 Democratic votes Clinton lined_up -- painfully -- for the NAFTA vote . Clinton clearly believes_in the issue . And it fills his need for the kind of hope-inspiring message that can be so useful to presidents . &quot; When I became President , I did not want to see this world polarized by trading blocs that would take the place of the nuclear blocs of the Cold_War , &quot; Clinton said Monday . Clinton ' s efforts with the 17 Asia-Pacific countries , which range from China and Brunei to South_Korea and Chile , show the value -- and the political limits -- of his trade efforts . Clinton and his aides lay out a compelling rationale for this Asia economic strategy . As he said Monday , the region already accounts_for about a third of the exports to the United States , and about 2 million American jobs . &quot; The American people cannot be as prosperous as they need to be unless we succeed here in Asia , &quot; he said . The talk_of APEC produced another benefit : It helped scare some European_nations into accepting GATT as a means of diminishing the threat of an exclusive Asian trading bloc . The bad news is that with NAFTA in the bag and GATT ' s completion almost in_view , the next big advances in free_trade are some distance off . Despite confident predictions of some Administration officials that this meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group will deliver another &quot; quantum leap &quot; advance , the immediate future is likely to hold only incremental advances . Moreover , some analysts predict that Clinton ' s political weakness and the growing momentum of protectionist sentiment could force him to slow his efforts . Last week , Clinton suddenly began again using his campaign-year rhetoric of &quot; fair trade &quot; instead of &quot; free_trade , &quot; suggesting that the United States needs to push the kind of tough line that may_not yield further concessions . And , too , there is the sobering possibility that GATT may be torpedoed in its final hours , perhaps over concern about the threat to national sovereignty posed by its successor organization . Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , who will become the new Speaker of the House , has declared this week that he will work for it , and that will help . Some Administration officials think Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , soon to be Senate majority_leader , will join in if he can strike a deal to get support for a capital_gains tax cut_in return . But victory is not in the bag . And a loss on GATT would be devastating to the President , and at least slow his market-opening efforts .</TEXT>
