   <HEADLINE> KEY SENATE PANEL , IN BLOW TO CLINTON , OKS ITS HEALTH BILL ; LEGISLATION : PLAN DOESN ' T ENSURE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE , DROPS OTHER CONTENTIOUS ITEMS CONTAINED IN PRESIDENT ' S VERSION . DEBATE NOW SHIFTS TO FLOORS OF CONGRESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Senate Finance_Committee on Saturday dealt a serious setback to President Clinton ' s campaign to assure health coverage to everyone , approving a health_care bill that falls_short_of that goal and rejects the most controversial elements of the Administration ' s plan . The Finance_Committee was the last of five congressional committees to act_on the health_care issue , and its vote sets the stage for a debate on the floors of both houses that will consume the rest of the summer . The committee ' s version is widely regarded_as the most important indicator of the shape of any eventual health_care reform package . Its legislation is far more conservative -- and more at_variance with the Clinton plan -- than those approved by the other committees . Voting 12 to 8 , the committee passed a bill to set a goal for coverage -- 95 % of the population by the year 2002 -- but relies only on a combination of economic incentives , changes in insurance law and government subsidies to get there . If voluntary efforts to expand the number of insured people missed the target , a commission would come_up with a plan for making_up the difference , and Congress would be compelled to accept , reject or modify it . The bill had been shaped by a group within the committee consisting at various times of six to eight conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans . They had effectively seized control from Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , whose ability and willingness to steer the Administration ' s health_care package through the panel had been in_question . The legislation &quot; represents the type of health_care reform that can pass this Congress and ultimately be signed into law by the President , &quot; said Sen . John B . Breaux ( D-La. ) , a leader of the bipartisan group . His comment swept aside Clinton ' s vow to veto any bill that does not guarantee universal coverage . Most of the President ' s allies on the committee supported the legislation , but they did so after recognizing that their only other option was to send no bill to the Senate floor . Clinton ' s reaction reflected similar ambivalence . He lauded the panel ' s action as &quot; another step closer to final passage. &quot; But the President also noted : &quot; I remain firmly committed to guaranteed health coverage for every American that can never be taken_away . . . . I am confident that we will achieve the goal of guaranteed coverage for everyone this year , and I look_forward to the debate in the full_House and Senate. &quot; Two committees in the House and two in the Senate have passed health_care bills , while one House committee has thrown_in_the_towel . Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , a supporter of the President ' s plan , hopes to recoup Saturday ' s loss as he crafts a single piece of legislation from the Finance_Committee version and one passed earlier by the Labor and Human Resources Committee . He insisted that the bill he produces for consideration by the full Senate &quot; will have the central objectives -- health_insurance for all Americans , and cost containment. &quot; Suggesting that his best hope now may lie_in &quot; innovation , &quot; Mitchell described the job before him as &quot; an effort to meld the pending bills in a way that , first , makes_sense for the country , and second , can gather sufficient political support. &quot; In early votes last week , the committee defeated even a watered-down version of Clinton ' s proposal to require employers to pay 80 % of their workers ' health benefits . That element had been the President ' s chief means of achieving universal coverage and was also the most contentious item in his proposal . Similarly , in dealing with the second most controversial issue -- how to contain health_care costs -- the Finance_Committee rejected caps on health_insurance premiums , even in a weaker form proposed by Moynihan . Instead , if health_care costs rise more quickly under a reformed system than they would otherwise have done , the Finance_Committee bill requires the government to make_up the difference three ways : scaling back subsidies to help lower-income people buy health coverage , trimming tax_breaks for the self-employed and raising the amounts that people in government-financed health_care programs pay out-of-pocket . But such measures would be so unpopular that many fear Congress would choose another unpleasant alternative : cut Medicare . Sen . John D . ( Jay ) Rockefeller IV ( Va. ) noted that concern but suggested he was hemmed_in by political reality . &quot; I strongly oppose this , and I will vote for it , because it seems this is the only way we ' re going to get_to the floor , &quot; he said . The committee , foreshadowing what could be a bitter fight in the House and Senate , was also the first to significantly alter Clinton ' s proposal that abortion be included in the bill ' s basic package of benefits . It inserted a &quot; conscience clause &quot; allowing employers to offer plans that do not include abortion . The chaotic race to pass the bill before Congress ' July 4 recess stood_in marked contrast to the committee ' s deliberations over the past few months , which proceeded at an excruciatingly slow pace . At one point , amid a flurry of papers and the back-and-forth rush of Senate staffers to copy machines , Moynihan was asked the cost of a particular amendment , which was later defeated . &quot; I don ' t believe we have the least idea , &quot; he said . The bill ' s general approach is to make health_insurance more affordable by pooling smaller purchasers -- individuals and firms with few workers -- into large , voluntary purchasing groups . It also would broaden tax_breaks for individuals buying coverage and extend subsidies to people earning less than double the poverty level , which is now $ 14 # 764 in annual income for a family of four . In addition , the legislation also would end widely condemned insurance-writing practices that have made_it difficult for people with known illnesses to buy coverage and for people changing jobs to take their old policy with them while awaiting coverage under their new employer ' s health plan . It is unclear how far such measures would go toward providing coverage for the 15 % of the population that is now uninsured . Sen . John H . Chafee ( R-R.I. ) , leader of the Finance_Committee rump group that shaped the legislation , predicted that it would extend coverage to at least 20 million of the estimated 39 million Americans who now lack it . However , that calculation assumes tens of billions of dollars a year would be available for subsidies to help buy insurance for people whose incomes are less than double the poverty level . The prospect of finding that money was called into question by a series of committee votes that added benefits , reduced the proposed cigarette tax , eliminated a 1 % payroll tax on large firms and rejected an increase in the tax on handgun ammunition . The handgun ammunition tax had been one of Moynihan ' s most cherished provisions , and his committee ' s 15-5 rejection of it marked an act of insubordination considered almost unthinkable under his recent predecessors as chairman . To many on Capitol_Hill , the vote underscored the degree to which Moynihan had lost_control of the panel to the bipartisan group of committee_members who called themselves the &quot; Mainstream Coalition. &quot; Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) repeatedly expressed his disdain for the bloc by referring to it as &quot; the midstream group , &quot; and on one occasion , the &quot; mid-crisis group. &quot; &quot; I am disappointed with the outcome of the committee ' s work , and doubt that the bill can pass in its present form , &quot; Dole said in a statement released after the vote . In another display of escalating political tension over health_care , Dole and Clinton exchanged testy remarks Saturday over a health_care proposal released by Dole last week , which is similar to the Finance_Committee bill in many ways . The Dole plan claims no new taxes and rejects the idea of providing a single package of benefits . The Dole bill could play a significant role in the Senate debate because it has 39 GOP co-sponsors , just two short of the number needed to launch a filibuster . In his Saturday radio address , Clinton condemned the Dole bill as &quot; politics as usual. &quot; &quot; It requires no contribution from the interest_groups that are making a great_deal of money out of the health_care system now , and no contribution from those who are not paying anything now into the system , &quot; the President said . Dole countered : &quot; The President seems more concerned about politics than he is about finding a true bipartisan solution to health_care reform. &quot; Another Prescription for Reform Major features of the health_care bill approved by the Senate Finance_Committee : COVERAGE * No employer or individual would be forced to buy insurance although universal coverage is a national goal . * If insurance reforms , subsidies and other measures fail to cover 95 % of Americans by 2002 , a national health commission would recommend action . Congress would have to consider its recommendations . * A six-month limit on pre-existing condition exclusions . No exclusion if a person had been insured recently by another health plan . * A one-time amnesty for people with pre-existing medical conditions to sign_up for private insurance without any restrictions . * Guaranteed coverage regardless of illness or change of jobs . * Annual open enrollment periods for health plans . * Community rating of insurance for individuals and those working for companies with fewer than 100 employees . * Insurers could adjust premiums only by the rate in each community ( 250 # 000 people and larger ) , by family size and by age . Older workers could be charged_up to twice younger workers ' rates . * Companies with 100 or more workers could self-insure . * All private plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program would have to offer coverage to anyone in their local market area , at local community rates , not federal workers ' rates . * The elderly would not get prescription_drug coverage unless they joined or stayed in a health_maintenance_organization . SUBSIDIES * Subsidies starting in 1997 to help the poor buy private insurance , including those now on Medicaid . * A 100 % tax_deduction for the self-employed and workers who pay their own premiums . * But a pay-as-you-go mechanism would automatically curb the subsidies and tax_breaks if they threatened to drive_up the deficit . BENEFITS * Health plans would offer a standard benefit package comparable_to a Blue Cross-Blue Shield standard family plan now available to federal workers , covering a broad range of services from hospital stays to prescription_drugs . * Consumers would get a choice between at least two standard plans , one with higher cost-sharing and / or fewer covered services . * A catastrophic plan -- paying only bills that exceed $ 5 # 000 per individual and $ 10 # 000 per family -- would be available . * Standard plans would include abortion , but any employer or health plan could refuse to buy or offer abortion coverage . FINANCING * Cigarette taxes would be raised by $ 1 a pack in 1995 . * A new tax on high-cost plans to raise $ 17 billion over 10 years . The most costly 40 % of plans would pay a 25 % tax on the difference between their premiums and the average premium in their area . * A 1.75 % tax on health_insurance premiums and self-insured plans to help fund academic health centers and graduate medical education . * Higher Medicare premiums for upper-income retirees ( over $ 90 # 000 single , $ 115 # 000 couples ) . * Make Medicare beneficiaries pay 20 % co-payments for clinical laboratory services . * Lower future Medicare increases in payments to physicians and hospitals . * Repeal the tax_break for so-called cafeteria plans that allow workers to avoid paying income_taxes on premiums deducted from their wages .
