   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : EARLY VALENTINE TREAT FOR ' BETTER ' BREATHERS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Betty Kallan of Oxnard would n ' t think_of missing the annual party hosted by the American Lung Assn . in Oxnard . Her convivial mood Tuesday was unmarred by her reliance on an oxygen tank , tucked discreetly next to the table , that emphysema has forced her to depend_on 23 hours every day . &quot; I ' m lucky , &quot; Kallan remarked to her companions . &quot; I go_out all_the time. &quot; Kallan was one of several hundred members of the six Better Breather Clubs in Ventura County who attended Tuesday ' s program . The luncheon featured a catered meal and singing , dancing and inspirational talks . The event was the fifth annual Valentine ' s Day Luncheon sponsored by the Ventura County chapter of the American Lung Assn . for the 1 # 000 county residents who belong_to the Better Breather Clubs . &quot; For many Better Breathers , the Valentine Luncheon is their only social outing of the year , &quot; said Steven Nagelberg , president of the association ' s board of directors . Members of the clubs suffer from chronic lung diseases such_as emphysema , chronic_bronchitis and asthma . Members receive medical advice and tips on coping_with the illnesses at the club ' s monthly meetings and by reading the club ' s monthly newsletter . Edna Ray , the association ' s executive_director , said lung ailments caused by tobacco use remain the country ' s No . 1 preventable killer . &quot; More people die from tobacco-related diseases than from AIDS , accidents and drugs , &quot; Ray said . &quot; And anyone with a lung disease will be affected by secondhand smoke. &quot; Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez , a guest speaker , told the audience that he will ask the city ' s staff March 1 to formulate a tougher anti-smoking ordinance for the city of Oxnard . That was good news to William Reynolds , an 85-year-old Camarillo resident who developed chronic_bronchitis 20 years ago after a lifetime of smoking . &quot; If I had quit before , I would n ' t be here , &quot; said Reynolds . &quot; But with the Better Breather Club , you can learn how to take_care of yourself . I recommend it. &quot; For information about the Better Breather Club , call the American Lung Assn . at 988-6023 . PATRICK McCARTNEY</TEXT>
