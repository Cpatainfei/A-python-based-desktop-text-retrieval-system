   <HEADLINE> ART ; LISTENING TO THE MILITANT MUSE ; THE STREETS ARE DANIEL MARTINEZ ' S GALLERY . HE LOVES TO MAKE WAVES ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT ARE MAKING WAVES FOR OTHER PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I am an extreme person , &quot; asserts Daniel J . Martinez . Not missing a beat , he adds , &quot; If I hadn ' t been an artist , I would have been a terrorist. &quot; And maybe he would . Certainly the Los Angeles-based artist takes himself and his artwork seriously enough for the role . Like an uncompromising guerrilla bent_on justice at any cost , Martinez is mad and wants everybody to know it . Without apology , he manipulates aesthetics and mixes mediums to make a social or political point . He typically opts for colossal scale and inevitably vents his wrath against the inequities of this postmodern , high-tech , paranoid culture . If nonstop exposure is any measure of talent , then Martinez is very good at what he does . Within the last few years , his art of rage has been seen in venues no less impressive than Seattle ' s 1991 &quot; In Public &quot; series , last year ' s prestigious and controversial Whitney Biennial in New York , the 1993 Venice Biennale and last summer ' s watershed public art_exhibition &quot; Culture in Action &quot; in Chicago . Each time he has managed to command both public attention and critical debate . In fact , Martinez stirs_up trouble just about everywhere he goes . His installation at Cornell University last year was vandalized by white_supremacists . That attack led , in turn , to an impassioned demonstration by Latino students . His banners in Seattle sparked a rancorous debate on the very nature of art that went all_the way to the front page of the city ' s major newspaper . Even the museum tags he created for the 1993 Whitney Biennial reading &quot; I can ' t Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White , &quot; were ultimately taken_to_be mean-spirited symbols of multicultural dogmatism . Martinez has created a high volume of disquieting work in a relatively short time , and it has earned him dual-edged critical recognition . Newsweek magazine recently named him American art ' s hot &quot; new face &quot; for 1994 , calling his Whitney tags &quot; the sharpest thorn &quot; at the show . Meanwhile , when asked_for this article what he thought_of the tags , Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes called them a &quot; cute one-liner of zero aesthetic value. &quot; Whatever the critics think , Martinez has managed to gain a foothold in the art world . He is a quintessential hybrid artist who crosses disciplines , mixes technologies , applies theories and appropriates disparate elements from the tangled web of postmodern society . Simultaneously , he is a construct , an angry decolonized individual who has made himself over from the fragments of his original culture and the debris of postindustrial society . In many ways , he embodies a migrant nomadism , an exilic and oppositional sensibility moving subversively through our cool , digitized culture . Although he now identifies himself as a Chicano , the 36-year-old Martinez is a classic study of the colonized Mexican American . Growing_up in the working-class city of Lennox ( near Los Angeles International Airport ) , he never learned to speak Spanish . Although both his parents were fluent , they spoke only English with him and , he says , &quot; Spanish was strictly forbidden by my teachers. &quot; By his account , he never learned anything positive about his ethnic background . So , like many of his generation , he just drifted into an unthinking identification with &quot; whiteness. &quot; Reflecting on that period , he says : &quot; The orientation of my world was toward whiteness . Mexican music was not played in my household . Spanish was never spoken . For me , white meant better . It meant privilege. &quot; By the time he graduated from high_school , Martinez knew he wanted to be an artist : &quot; I wanted to learn about the art world and what it meant to actually be part of it . So I applied to every art_school in the country , and I was rejected by every art_school in the country . Finally , the only place left to try was CalArts , &quot; which was where he ended_up . But art_school wasn ' t what he expected . In his mind , it would be a place of creative exchange . Instead , he found it to be a continuation of the prejudiced education he felt he had received all his life . &quot; Even there , I was looked down on by others . On the surface the place seems open , but it ' s as alienating and racist as anywhere else , &quot; he claims . Perhaps that ' s where Martinez ' s irrepressible urge to expose the ugliest truths took_root . Even before graduating in 1979 , Martinez began a long , intense series of what he calls &quot; aesthetic investigations. &quot; &quot; I worked_through several art_forms , &quot; he explains , &quot; searching for that form that would carry the content . I found myself dissatisfied with the object in the gallery . So I started to combine forms , to collaborate with other artists , with whole communities . This finally led to where I ' m at now : large-scale interventions into public landscapes. &quot; During that molting period in the the early ' 80s , he fell_in with Harry Gamboa Jr . and ASCO ( Spanish for nausea ) , a Chicano art group based in East Los Angeles . ASCO ' s work was infused with social commentary and a cutting sardonic edge . A master of appropriation , Martinez recognized the power in this specialized ethnic aesthetic and began reinventing it . He also worked with local performance artists and often stayed_up until dawn discussing political_theory with radical academics . He earned money working as a free-lance photographer and stole whatever free_time he could to read : existentialist Albert Camus , Italian Futurist manifestoes , Michel Foucault and even ' 60s Situationist tracts . As his universe of conceptual reference_points expanded , his anger continued to brew . He was in training , &quot; arming myself with a philosophical position , a base of thought . Once that foundation was grounded , I could move anywhere I wanted to go. &quot; By the early ' 90s , it all began to come_together . His 1992 show , &quot; I Pissed on the Man Who Called Me a Dog , &quot; opened at New Langton Arts in San Francisco . It exemplified all_the basic elements of Martinez ' s world_view . An especially angry , almost rabid installation , the work was a claustrophobic labyrinth strewn with old clothes and cardboard boxes that reeked of mildew . A shrieking soundtrack of deranged gospel music played in the background while strategically placed video monitors ran endless loops of violence excerpted from film , cartoons and other sources . The installation also presented several photographs superimposed with quotes from famous thinkers . One piece depicted a grisly atrocity from the Bosnian war . Over it was Aristotle ' s dictum : &quot; Anyone can become angry -- that is easy . But to be angry with the right person , to the right degree , at the right time , for the right purpose and in the right way -- that is not easy. &quot; Aristotle ' s words could well be Martinez ' s motto . Indeed , insult is a through line in his work . Every installation becomes another opportunity to agitate , another chance to deliver a well-deserved punch into the gut of mainstream America . In the process , Martinez joins with other artists whose work only succeeds to the extent that it offends &quot; I want to get_to people , &quot; Martinez says . &quot; So , to be successful by the standard I ' ve set for myself , the work must go straight to the core of the issue and deliver a deathblow . Anything less would be just empty posturing. &quot; In his installation for the 1993 Venice Biennale , &quot; Big Bad Wolf , &quot; Martinez offended his Italian hosts by including grisaille paintings on black velvet , each one depicting members of Italy ' s most notorious terrorist group . One writer in the journal Art in America said that Martinez ' s work represented the &quot; strongest current of honest anger &quot; in the show . The whole installation was imbued with a &quot; sense of suppressed aggression. &quot; that ' s Martinez ' s forte : He apprehends the anger of a place -- political , social or personal . Then , he turns the intangible emotions into palpable artworks . His long journey into ethnic self-awareness makes the lapel buttons he did for last year ' s Whitney Biennial a lesson in high irony . As he says , &quot; The buttons were open_to multiple readings . White people thought it was reverse racism . People_of_color thought it was funny . For me , personally , the buttons were something else again . Even though I once tried to be white , I have now reached the point where I can ' t imagine ever wanting to be white. &quot; The tags incensed a great many patrons and reviewers . The buttons pushed a button , and they became emblems of the mainstream art world ' s disdain for multiculturalism . He struck a nerve once again when he built the outdoor installation &quot; The Castle Is Burning &quot; last fall at Cornell University . When a giant black asterisk of particle_board started going_up on campus , Ithaca ' s pristine Ivy League community was told that the panels that composed the asterisk were a behavioral science experiment . In actuality , they were the building_blocks of his installation , part of &quot; Revelaciones / Revelations : Hispanic Art of Evanescence , &quot; the first Latino site-specific exhibition in the United States . Martinez selected the Arts Quad as his site , he says , precisely because &quot; it is the most beautiful place on campus . It is the view , and that is directly related to privilege . It ' s about the whole notion of beauty and who has the privilege of having the beautiful view. &quot; To further punctuate his point , Martinez placed red Styrofoam letters on top of the asterisk . Hovering high above ground they cut_through the landscape with sayings such_as this one from Diogenes : &quot; In the rich_man ' s house , the only place to spit is in his face. &quot; These colossal billboards of contempt functioned as both sculpture and painting . The asterisk ' s panels , with their luxuriant , almost velvety , black fields could have been abstract canvases from the ' 60s . The pitch-covered boards and the razor-thin slits that cut horizontally across them also suggested modernist sculpture . But the work was never taken seriously on its own terms . Many on campus saw it as nothing more_than a nasty jab at Cornell ' s hallowed traditions . The student newspaper called it &quot; non-art &quot; and a &quot; monstrosity. &quot; By the time the show opened , vandals had spray-painted a swastika and vulgar racial epithets all_over the piece . Although the university president eventually condemned the racist graffiti , Latino and other minority students occupied the administration building for four days to protest campus intolerance . Looking_back on the dispute , Chon Noriega , co-curator of the show and a professor at UCLA ' s School of TV and Film , claims that &quot; the piece made manifest all_the conflicts hidden by the Ivy League facade . It exposed the hypocrisy of a place that hides behind the notion of beauty . &quot; that ' s what Martinez does best , &quot; Noriega maintains . &quot; He peels back the outer skin and shows the worst of what lies just beneath the surface . And then he ' s on to the next project . &quot; Daniel is a nomad , &quot; Noriega continues with a tone of both respect and cultural pity . &quot; I don ' t think he has ties to any particular , localized community . He flies into a place and gets a sense of it . He dissects it and pinpoints its soft underbelly . He then presses_down_on its most sensitive pressure points . He ' s a catalyst. &quot; In the fall of 1991 , Martinez played a similar role in Seattle . Commissioned to create street banners to commemorate the opening of the Seattle Art Museum , he used the medium to question the city ' s social reality . Calling it &quot; The Quality_of_Life , &quot; he fabricated two-sided banners based on the idea of society ' s haves and have-nots . The black-and-white banners were Spartan , almost grim . The &quot; have &quot; sides asked such questions as &quot; Do you have a beach_house or a mountain house ? &quot; The other side read : &quot; Do you have a place to live ? &quot; Even before the banners went_up , the local retail business association was outraged . In a letter to the Arts Commission , they said they had been led to believe that the &quot; banners would be colorful , cheerful and enjoyable . . . . &quot; Instead , the letter complained , &quot; they were sociopolitical messages. &quot; The Seattle Times ran a front-page story and photo as well as an editorial condemning the flags as false art . For Martinez , that was the point . &quot; Art is an encounter , &quot; he says . &quot; My work stimulates people to ask questions and re-examine their role in society . The real question in the Seattle situation wasn ' t whether or not my work was really art . The real question was control . Do business interests own all_the avenues of discourse in a retail core , or can artists contribute ? &quot; Besides drawing the whole city into a debate about art , his Seattle project caught the attention of one of America ' s most innovative curators , Mary Jane Jacobs . &quot; What I saw in his work , &quot; she says , &quot; was a real consideration for his audience . I was drawn to that . In the past , audience was a given -- there were patrons , dealers , collectors , museums . But now , in a post-studio reality , work that matters is much more audience-specific . Artists now ask : ' Who is it for ? ' &quot; In late 1991 , Jacobs approached Martinez about being part of a new public arts project sponsored by Sculpture Chicago that would take an audience-specific , non-institutional approach . Their collaboration was so natural that she took the project ' s title , &quot; Culture in Action , &quot; from a presentation he had made to a Mexican American group . For his part , Martinez spent two years working_on a twofold Chicago project . An assistant_professor in the Department of Studio Art at UC Irvine , he would leave for Illinois every Thursday night to spend the next four days working with community organizations in Chicago . One result was &quot; 100 Victories / 10 # 000 Tears , &quot; an installation that moved giant concrete blocks ( from a building the University of Illinois was literally deconstructing ) to a nearby university site that had been the locus of labor protests during the 19th Century . Using these discarded building_blocks , Martinez created an &quot; alternative university &quot; space . The second part of his project , &quot; Consequences of a Gesture , &quot; ( in collaboration with Vinzula Kara ) was , as Martinez describes it , an &quot; absurdist parade , carnival and spectacle. &quot; The procession , which took_place last June , involved 800 marchers from Mexican American and African American communities . The artist explains that at least one of the goals of the project was to generate a community &quot; intervention &quot; that would allow the audience to displace art objects as the central element of work . Over the next two years Martinez will show his work -- in one form or another -- in Dublin , Moscow , Pittsburgh , San Francisco , Venezuela , Saskatchewan and Riverside . Through it all , Martinez says he ' s ultimately driven by the fervent desire to make art part of life . &quot; Otherwise , &quot; he says , &quot; why make_it during these times of crisis ? Is it worth our effort and energy if it can ' t be part of real_life and affect us in some way ? The answer is no. &quot;</TEXT>
