   <HEADLINE> U.S. FIRMS POISED TO TAP NEW MARKETS AFTER S . AFRICA VOTE ; POLITICS : SOCIAL CHANGES ARE LIKELY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT , MORE DEMAND FOR CONSUMER GOODS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American makers of computers , telephones , clothing , drugs and other consumer products are beating a path to a democratic South_Africa to tap a market long deprived of full access to the world ' s latest technologies . Wall_Street companies are also set to launch global bond offerings to fund massive growth projects for the new government and private firms . South_Africa ' s first all-race election has inspired talk_of nation building that involves massive investments from local and foreign governments and companies . &quot; South_Africa is now playing catch-up &quot; after years of being severed from U.S. business , said Meg Voorhes , an analyst at the Investor Responsibility Research_Center , a Washington-based nonprofit group . &quot; Policies to redress past social inequities are clearly going_to be a central feature of economic_policy , &quot; said Geoffrey Brooks , assistant_professor of management at the Wharton School in Philadelphia . &quot; Building housing and electrification are going_to create all sorts of opportunities for investment , &quot; he said . At least 152 American companies have offices in South_Africa , 45 of them opened since July , 1991 , when President George_Bush lifted the 1986 ban on new U.S. investment in the country , according to the IRRC . Companies are moving_in even faster now that apartheid has crumbled and they are spared the sanctions by American_states , cities , investment funds , colleges and consumers that caused an exodus from South_Africa in the late 1980s . AT &amp; T Corp . and Apple Computer Inc. this week announced plans to enter South_Africa , while companies such_as Bristol Myers Squibb , Colgate-Palmolive Co . and WordPerfect are expanding existing operations . In January , Sara Lee Corp. , the largest U.S. employer in South_Africa , pumped new capital into its shoe_polish , hosiery , intimate apparel and sales network there , hoping to boost its annual revenue base of $ 150 million . American companies wary of making direct investments are testing the market through local distributors . Such firms have quadrupled to about 400 since July , 1991 , according to an IRRC survey . &quot; Companies making lower-priced consumer products are looking_at the black consumer market , &quot; Voorhes said . Winning customers is expected to be easy since many U.S. products found their way to South_Africa through third-party distributors before sanctions were lifted . American brands are also well-known through television and movies . &quot; So there ' s a ready market , and it ' s easy to get_up and running and become profitable , &quot; Voorhes said . As a result , U.S. companies , which looked_to Eastern Europe for greener pastures when South_Africa was blackballed , are now setting their sights on the world ' s latest democracy . &quot; On my first trip to South_Africa , people were already consuming software , &quot; said Corey Freebairn , WordPerfect ' s regional director for Africa . &quot; In Eastern Europe , they were wondering whether to computerize or not . &quot; It ' s also English-speaking , so the software is already available in the language they want , &quot; he said . Moreover , South_Africa ' s developed infrastructure and banking system make_doing business there a breeze compared to former communist countries . But the country still lags in telecommunications and banking technologies that Americans now take_for granted . And despite a wide gap between the rich and poor , its growing economy and per-capita income are whetting an appetite for a better lifestyle , companies believe . &quot; We see significant demand for telephones and pagers , &quot; said a spokesman for Motorola Inc. , which plans to reopen a sales office in Johannesburg , which it left in 1985 . Corporate growth will require bank funding , and Citicorp will reopen its South_African office by year ' s end , initially to serve commercial customers , a spokesman said . More ambitious projects by the new government and private companies will be funded through capital market borrowings , and Wall_Street firms such_as Salomon Bros . Inc. are already gearing_up for global bond offerings . &quot; By next week , things will get clearer , &quot; Salomon managing director John Purcell said of an imminent offering . &quot; We ' re thinking of starting with a bond issue and then moving quickly to mergers and acquisitions and various kinds of deals. &quot; Recent violence in South_Africa has not deterred American_plans to move_into the country , according to a survey of eight companies by IRRC . &quot; They all told us they had been expecting violence to increase in the short term and are not fazed by it , &quot; Voorhes said . &quot; South_Africa still looks_like an exciting long-term possibility. &quot;</TEXT>
