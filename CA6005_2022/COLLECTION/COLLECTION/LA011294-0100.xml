   <HEADLINE> RESPONSE ON RADIATION STUDIES SUGGESTS AN ICEBERG IS BELOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some 4 # 000 American civilians have given government investigators accounts of studies that they believe may have exposed them to radiation , suggesting for the first time that the Cold_War ' s human guinea_pigs may be far more numerous than previously believed . In addition , a far larger_number of U.S. military veterans -- roughly 8 # 000 -- have called the Energy_Department to report accounts of experimentation on servicemen . Those calls are being directed to the Department of Veterans Affairs , which has acknowledged in recent days that radiation experiments involving human subjects were conducted at 48 of its facilities . The calls , coming_into the Energy_Department ' s hot_line at a rate of as_many as 700 per hour , have swamped a hastily organized reporting system and overwhelmed a government effort designed to &quot; come clean &quot; with Americans and possibly compensate victims . When she unveiled her department ' s new openness policy , Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said that her agency ' s records indicated between 600 and 800 human subjects may have been used in past radiation experiments . And while officials do not yet have a system to handle the volume of calls they are receiving , they cautioned that they do not want to discourage the overwhelming public response to O ' Leary ' s initiative . As they work to piece together a picture of experiments from three decades ' worth of confusing and incomplete documents , government workers are counting_on the torrent of information they are getting from citizens to plug &quot; holes &quot; in the government ' s records , a senior Energy_Department official said . &quot; We do not know the total universe &quot; of radiation experiments conducted under federal sponsorship , said Michael Gauldin , an O ' Leary spokesman and a key member of a government task_force established to review the conduct of radiation experiments performed between 1944 and 1974 . &quot; There ' s never been a net cast to catch all_of this , so we really have no idea the extent of what went_on . It is impossible to overestimate the problems we may have . But we are determined to overcome them. &quot; Gauldin said the Human Radiation Inter-Agency Working_Group has begun to organize itself to oversee the task of culling and classifying documents on what could be thousands of radiation experiments conducted across the nation with government funds . Complicating the task is the fact the Energy_Department did not exist during the entire period under study . Several agencies -- including the Atomic Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration , which were subsumed into the Energy_Department in 1977 -- as well as several Pentagon offices , appear to have funded most of the studies . Moreover , those organizations frequently sponsored the studies but allowed researchers broad latitude in organizing and maintaining their experimental logs and material . As a result , some of the documentation that could confirm a subject ' s participation may have been lost or destroyed , officials warned . That has prompted government investigators to remind universities , hospitals and research institutions that it would be illegal to destroy documents related to the search . In addition , the investigators are developing chain-of-custody procedures like those used in the handling of criminal evidence to ensure that existing documents are not tampered with . Even when the government ' s task_force has gathered those documents , it will have the monumental task of sifting through them and recommending which of those experiments may qualify subjects for compensation or for some form_of_government action . While some experiments underwritten by the government were designed to benefit the health of the subject , others were not . While some government-sponsored experiments informed subjects of the nature of the experiments , others clearly did not . And while some continued to track the health of subjects over the long_run , others did not .</TEXT>
