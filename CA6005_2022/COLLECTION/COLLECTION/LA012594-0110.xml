   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : WINTER_OLYMPICS ADVERTISERS IN A SPIN OVER MIRACLE ON ICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just a_few months ago , the Winter_Olympics seemed about as thrilling to marketers as watching a Norwegian iceberg melt . There are many Americans who cannot identify a luge -- even if one were to ram them from behind . With viewership of the Winter_Olympics far less than the Summer Olympics , skeptics have said that sponsors who invest big bucks in Winter Games are tossing their money into the snow . But when Coca-Cola , Visa and six others agreed to pay a fee of $ 40 million each to globally link their products to Atlanta ' s 1996 Summer Olympics , the rights to the Winter_Olympics were thrown_in for free . And for the 1994 Winter_Olympics , that could prove to be as_good_as gold . As Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding bone_up for their own World Heavyskate Championship next month in Lillehammer , Norway , the industry buzz is that the Olympic sponsors may have stumbled upon the sports marketing gig of the year -- if not the decade . Authorities are compiling evidence to determine whether Harding helped plan an attack earlier this month by a man who tried to disable Kerrigan at a Detroit skating rink . While it remains unclear whether Harding will be permitted to compete in the Games , marketers say that even without her presence , Kerrigan will attract a huge viewing_audience . &quot; There is a Winter Games countdown each evening on the nightly news , &quot; said Brian Murphy , publisher of Sports Marketing Letter . &quot; It will be a ratings titan. &quot; The Winter Games have always been the &quot; weak sister &quot; of the Olympics , said Lesa Ukman , publisher of IEG Sponsorship Report , a Chicago newsletter . But the publicity the attack on Kerrigan has generated , she said , &quot; is the best thing that has ever happened to the Winter Games. &quot; Indeed , CBS has only &quot; a_few &quot; available spots left for its entire 120 hours of Olympics broadcast , from Feb . 12 to 26 , said George Schweitzer , senior_vice_president of the network . It expects to be sold_out of commercial time by the end of this week , he said . In 1992 , the network was still selling air time on the day the Winter_Olympics began . Since most Winter_Olympics viewers will probably focus_on the women ' s skating finals , CBS is expected to tease curious viewers with an avalanche of updates on everything from Harding ' s latest pool hall exploits to the color of Kerrigan ' s tutu . &quot; This will raise the ratings through the roof , &quot; said Don Franken , president of the Los Angeles sports marketing firm World Class Sports . &quot; The trick now is for sponsors to heavily market their sponsorships. &quot; Sponsors who do_it right , he said , could see sales increase . It might not be that easy to figure_out who is a real Olympic sponsor and who is simply running ads that seem to tie the advertiser to the Games . Good ol ' Dave Thomas , founder of Wendy ' s hamburger chain , will appear in TV spots in which he dreams of &quot; winning gold &quot; in everything from ski_jumping to bobsledding . In one ad , he even asks 1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi to skate with him in competition . But Wendy ' s is not a so-called global sponsor . Those companies have paid $ 40 million each just for the rights to say they are &quot; official &quot; worldwide sponsors . Some of them will spend up_to $ 40 million more for the production of ads and for air time . Other sponsorships are far less costly . Since Wendy ' s has purchased air time during the CBS telecast -- and paid the network a stipend -- it can refer to itself as a &quot; sponsor of the CBS telecast &quot; of the Games . Won ' t some viewers be confused ? &quot; It ' s possible , but that ' s not our intention , &quot; Wendy ' s spokesman Mike Jenkins said . One of the largest global sponsors is Coca-Cola , which will air 165 TV spots during the Winter_Olympics . &quot; In terms of enhancing our global leadership position , the Olympics make perfect sense , &quot; Coke spokesman Bob Bertini said . Xerox is putting an Olympic spin on almost every marketing or promotional campaign it has going . &quot; The ice_skating incident has put the Winter Games smack in front of everyone ' s eyeballs , &quot; said Terry Dillman , Los Angeles-based manager of Olympic marketing for Xerox . &quot; We ' re trying to ' Olympicize ' every program we have , &quot; Dillman said . At trade shows , Xerox brings along banners , T-shirts and pins that have the Olympic insignias . And its ads include the familiar Olympic rings . For the past year , every package of Kodak film sold has also featured the rings . &quot; We ' re leveraging our association with one of the world ' s most recognized symbols , &quot; explained Gregory Walker , marketing manager at Kodak . But the most recognized symbol of the 1994 Winter_Olympics might be Kerrigan . And two sponsors that have link-ups with her are taking full advantage of it . Reebok was in Los Angeles last weekend filming a new Kerrigan TV spot to be aired during the Games . In the ad , which shows Kerrigan in training , she talks_about all_the obstacles she had to overcome to make_it to the Olympics . But Kerrigan will make no mention of the incident in Detroit in the ad . &quot; People may see the ad and think it was created in response to the events in Detroit , &quot; Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson said . &quot; But it was planned months ago. &quot; Campbell Soup , meanwhile , has been airing a spot that shows Kerrigan -- in full hockey uniform -- knocking a hockey_player to the ice . The idea for the spot was concocted 18 months ago when Kerrigan told executives at Campbell ' s ad_agency that -- when she was very young -- she preferred playing hockey with the boys to figure_skating . After the Detroit nightmare , Campbell asked Kerrigan if she wanted them to stop running the ad . She said no . In the meantime , grocers are having a tough time holding_on to 15 # 000 life-size cardboard cut-outs of Kerrigan that Campbell distributed to them this month . &quot; They ' re disappearing , &quot; said Kevin Lowery , a Campbell spokesman . &quot; And we don ' t know where. &quot; Briefly . . . The New York office of Venice-based Chiat / Day is said to be talking with Estee Lauder about handling its Clinique ad account . . . . Culver City-based Market And has acquired the Beverly Hills design studio 12-30 Group . . . . BFP Holding Corp. , the parent of Glendora-based Treasure_Chest Advertising Co. , agreed to acquire Retail Graphics Holding Co . of Dallas . . . . Reebok International has signed a long-term marketing agreement with the National Football_League that includes plans to sponsor the NFL ' s planned European league . Going_for the Gold Eight major marketers have signed_on as &quot; global sponsors &quot; of the 1994 Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway , and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . Each sponsor must pay at least $ 40 million in cash and services to be linked to the Olympics . ( A number of other companies have signed_on for limited sponsorships that are not global. ) Here are the global sponsors and their marketing plans for the winter Games . * Coca-Cola : Roll_out massive new ad_campaigns for Diet Coke and Coke . * Xerox : Publish an Olympics newsletter and promote its Olympics link in ads . * Bausch &amp; Lomb : Supply sunglasses &amp; contact_lenses to athletes and advertise its ties to the Games . * Visa : Promote its status as the only credit_card accepted at the Games . * Eastman-Kodak : Market &quot; official film &quot; designation on all products and sweepstakes . * Time-Warner : Market its Olympics connection in Sports Illustrated magazine . * Panasonic : Promote itself as supplier of video_equipment to athletes in training . * IBM : Roll_out a new campaign as the official Olympics &quot; data processor. &quot; Source : International Events Group</TEXT>
