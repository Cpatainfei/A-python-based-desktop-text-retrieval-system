   <HEADLINE> A LESSON IN LOVE ? ; THE LATEST CAMPUS DEBATE IS WHETHER STUDENT-PROFESSOR ROMANCES ARE ABOUT POWER OR PASSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may start with a bawdy passage from Chaucer or a heated explication of cell mitosis . A student ' s eyes meet a professor ' s . Hearts pitter-pat . And before you can say &quot; Educating Rita , &quot; homework has a whole new connotation . Students returning to campus this fall will likely find the debate about &quot; consensual relations &quot; one of the hottest fronts in the ongoing gender wars . From guidelines discouraging professors from dating people currently enrolled in their classes to blanket bans on fraternization between faculty and students , college administrators from Cal State Fullerton to Harvard have proposed or passed edicts on the subject . In reaction to what some see as the authoritarian underpinnings of the &quot; banning movement , &quot; a loosely_knit group called CASE -- Consenting Academics For Sexual Equity -- has taken the_matter onto the Internet , where opponents are gathering via E-mail . Virtually everyone who has jumped into the debate will concede that some student-professor flings can blossom into loving relationships -- even marriage . Virtually everyone deplores harassment by professors or any exchange of sex for grades . If the various sides agree on anything else , it is that this issue , like many other societal concerns these days , pivots on a handful of fundamental terms : power . . . consent . . . responsibility . Beyond that , the argument moves quickly into the subtle semantics of gender politics . Well before CASE sent the discussion sizzling through cyberspace , hanky-panky had been translated into the abstruse murk of academese . Student-professor shenanigans became &quot; intimate asymmetrical relationships , &quot; deriving from &quot; power differentiated positions. &quot; Professors , in other words , have more clout than students . Therefore interactions between students and instructors are unequal . &quot; So what ? &quot; smirk opponents of restrictions . &quot; So stop it ! &quot; huff those who see themselves as supporters of students ' rights . Barry Dank , a professor of sociology at Cal State Long_Beach who organized CASE last spring , says he has as strong a record as anyone of encouraging students to file complaints against harassers . But such cases , he adds , have nothing to do with students who enter freely into a relationship with a professor -- or with anyone else . He blames much of the anti-fraternization activity on &quot; authoritarian feminists . . . . They take this motherly image -- ' we ' ll protect you whether you want our help or not. ' How hypocritical ! How offensive ! &quot; In the late 1970s , Dank locked horns with Anita Bryant , whose &quot; Save Our Children &quot; campaign attempted to ban homosexual teachers from public_schools . He sees similarities between that &quot; crusade &quot; and this one , which also presumes_to protect innocent students , and paints men as sexual predators . &quot; I ' m alienated from the idea of putting women back into the category of ' women and children , ' &quot; he says , &quot; from the whole victimization cult . . . . &quot; Norma Chinchilla , a sociology professor and director of the women ' s studies program at Long_Beach , doesn ' t think much of the case made by CASE . Concern about relations between instructors and students who date is fueled by compassion , not ideology , she says . &quot; So many women faculty_members end_up having to put the pieces together after these things go awry , after these students have major trauma. &quot; Bernice Sandler , a scholar with the National Assn . for Women in Education , a 3000-member professional support and development group , has studied numerous surveys of harassment on college campuses . She says that 20 % to 30 % of undergraduate women and 30 % to 40 % of women in graduate programs report that professors have subjected them to behavior that is defined as sexual_harassment by those conducting the surveys -- although the students did not initially consider it such . By the same token , she says , women who have had relations with professors often believe that the affair is consensual as it occurs but later become convinced that they were exploited . Some feminist scholars even contend that consent is a meaningless term in relations of this sort . &quot; The Lecherous Professor &quot; ( University of Illinois , 1984 ) , an influential book on harassment , states that view emphatically . In a note added_to the 1990 edition , co-author Billie Wright Dziech argues : &quot; Where power differentials exist , there can be no ' mutual consent. ' The infinitesimal number of cases in which professors / teaching assistants and students do develop genuine and seemingly abiding attractions can , as the book suggests , be treated on an individual basis without denying students protection from the campus Lotharios who claim ' consent ' every time they seek to bed a confused or intimidated victim. &quot; Chinchilla recalls a student who came sobbing into her office after a male faculty_member had dumped her . &quot; She said , ' I was so flattered . He was the first man I had ever met who wasn ' t interested in my body , but was interested in my mind. ' &quot; She found that incredibly wonderful . But then she found_out it wasn ' t her mind that he was interested in . When I suggested that maybe she wanted to make a complaint , because after she had backed_off she felt really pressured in her act , she said , ' No , it was my fault for not realizing what was happening in the first place. ' &quot; A lot of students never complain . They feel it ' s their fault. &quot; In fact , says Ann J . Lane , a history professor and chair of the women ' s studies program at the University of Virginia , most of the students alleging sexual_harassment against professors on her campus say the relationships began as consensual ones . Last year Lane spearheaded an effort at Virginia to enact guidelines that included a ban of all relations between undergraduate students and their professors . Lane says she was astonished at the intensity of the national debate on the guidelines -- which the administration ultimately refused to enact . &quot; The purpose of the regulation was to empower students . . . . Many students said , ' I didn ' t know how to say no. ' &quot; How do you say no , &quot; asks Lane , &quot; to someone who ' s your father ' s age and on your dissertation committee ? . . . I have students who drop_out of school , who say ' I can ' t go_back into the chemistry building. ' &quot; To those who say students are adults and don ' t need to be told how to behave , Lane replies : &quot; We do that all_the time . We tell these adults what courses they can take , what alcohol they can drink. &quot; Which is not to say , Lane contends , that she and those who support her views are interested in regulating the sexual lives of students . &quot; It would be impossible . It ' s the professors we ' re talking about. &quot; * Students who say they are involved in good relationships with professors are as reluctant to speak on the record as those who say they have been devastated . Both fear repercussions . A woman who asked to be identified only as a graduate_student at a Midwest college , for instance , tells of falling_in_love with a professor while she served as his graduate research assistant . The couple waited until the student was no longer the professor ' s charge before consummating their attraction . But then one of the young_woman ' s classmates spotted the couple at an off-campus cafe . &quot; She called a meeting of my other classmates ( in the department ) . . . . The department chair called us in and said , ' This will stop. ' &quot; The couple refused to break_up . So the chair refused to issue a letter critiquing the student ' s progress . Meanwhile , word of the relationship spread . &quot; I felt_like I had the scarlet_letter on my head , &quot; the woman says . &quot; I consider myself fairly liberal , but I am very offended by the feminist insinuation that as a woman I am incapable of making my own decisions . &quot; We all make mistakes , &quot; she continues . &quot; If dating a professor is a mistake , we learn from it . But we could make that same mistake with a businessman or banker . . . . If you are a male in this society , you always have more power than a woman , so any relationship could be considered asymmetrical. &quot; * Like that student , Daphne Patai , a professor of Spanish and Women ' s Studies at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , has tapped into CASE ' s nascent electronic debate on the Internet . She hasn ' t formally affiliated herself with the group . But Patai , who co-authored an upcoming book -- &quot; Professing Feminism : Cautionary Tales From the Strange World of Women ' s Studies &quot; ( Basic Books , 1994 ) -- does worry about the &quot; crusade mentality , &quot; on campuses . &quot; Professors , &quot; she says , &quot; are not ogres , and students are not children . . . . When I was a grad_student , women had to be in the dorms at 10:30 or 11:00 . . . . In the bad old days , people lost jobs because they had relations with students . Do we want to do that all_over again ? &quot; At least some critics of student-faculty relations scoff at the notion that it must come_to that . Judith Sheine , an assistant_professor of architecture at UCLA and Cal Poly Pomona , notes that she and many of her female colleagues have , on occasion , been hit upon by young_men in their classes . The proper response , she says , is simply to &quot; act professorial. &quot; One way or another , she says , she and the professors she knows get the student ' s focus back on the class . &quot; As a faculty_member , it seems to me , you should have some self-control. &quot; Dank , of Long_Beach , is rankled that the argument so often is cast in such highbrow tones -- as if professors were all-powerful gods and students mere mortals . The issue for him hinges_on logic , not sex -- although the sex aspect is what keeps the thinking skewed , he says . For instance : If conflict_of_interest is such a concern , why do ban supporters tend to ignore other obvious breeches , such_as professors who have colleagues ' children or spouses in their classes ? &quot; And what about friendships ? Think_about the components of friendship : Caring , loyalty . . . . Why select out the sexual component for special attention ? &quot; By Dank ' s analysis , the challenge to &quot; asymmetry &quot; stems not from true concern about conflict_of_interest or compassion for fragile young souls , but from &quot; older females attempts to control younger females. &quot; Dank shifts into very professorial , one-man Socratic dialogue : &quot; One would say , ' Well Dank , I don ' t quite get_it . Why would middle-aged females ' -- which is basically what we ' re talking_about -- ' why would they want to control younger students ? ' &quot; There is , Dank answers , a historic tension between the generations . He sees it like this : Older_men have never been averse to younger_women ' s charms . Younger women are naturally -- perhaps biologically -- attracted to men of power and wisdom , who happen to be older as a rule . So young_women are always draining the pool of mature , intelligent men from which middle-aged women hope to find mates . This is especially true at the university , where older_men and younger_women continuously rub together , so to speak . Academic feminists , naturally , resent that , he says . And they ' re willing to force bureaucratic controls on younger_women to keep them in_line , he adds . * Chinchilla , increasingly cast as Dank ' s nemesis at Long_Beach , doesn ' t buy his analysis . &quot; I think that ' s an incredible fantasy on his part , &quot; she says . &quot; It makes these middle-aged men seem so incredibly attractive . The reason they ' re dating their 18- and 19-year-old students is because women their own age are_on to them. &quot; But that ' s not really the issue , Chinchilla says : &quot; If the classroom becomes sexualized , if the boundaries become blurred in ways that hint at intimacy , I think the learning environment becomes contaminated. &quot; Joan Blythe , an associate_professor of English at the University of Kentucky , took a different tack during an exchange on the subject in Harper ' s Magazine last year . &quot; Those pushing for a ban , &quot; she said , &quot; are people who fear real_life , especially the protean power of lust . College for them is about isolation from the real_world , not introduction to it. &quot; The Harper ' s exchange drew a blistering response from readers , including many academics . Blythe ( &quot; I ' m the most retiring person around &quot; ) was stunned and offended . In retrospect , she is more circumspect . Sex is complicated , she says . Cruelty of any sort , on the other hand , is rather simple . &quot; People must learn to be personally responsible , &quot; she says . &quot; that ' s the problem with our young people -- they need to learn to be more responsible_for their lives and for their bodies. &quot; But that ' s only part of the problem : &quot; I ' m very sympathetic with women who are beset by arrogant , mean , self-serving professors . Apparently there are a lot of them out there . I ' m glad I don ' t know them . It ' s a tragedy. &quot; The antidote to naive irresponsibility and cunning selfishness may be conveniently close_at_hand , she says . &quot; Rather than having a ban on faculty-student sex , we should have a requirement that everyone read Milton and Shakespeare . I think when we neglect the older authors we lose the great lessons about being loving and responsible . We forget the values of strong community . . . . &quot; In the classics , there ' s a great celebration of the joy of being alive , of the amazing gift of life and the world and the responsibility you have toward it. &quot; If professors and students were_better grounded in those values , she says , their passion for each other might , at least occasionally , give_way to a passion for knowledge .</TEXT>
