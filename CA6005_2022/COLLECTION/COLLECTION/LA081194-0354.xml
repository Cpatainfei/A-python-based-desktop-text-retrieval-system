   <HEADLINE> TALKS ON BLUE CROSS CHARITIES COME UNDER FIRE ; INSURANCE : CLOSED MEETINGS ARE AT_ISSUE . CONSUMER ADVOCATES ARE TOLD TO WRITE A LETTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A consumer group has sharply criticized a state agency ' s supervision of a Blue Cross of California plan to distribute more_than $ 2 billion in charitable funds to health_care organizations . The issue involves talks between the California Department of Corporations and Blue Cross about the insurer ' s charitable responsibilities since nonprofit Blue Cross spun_off most of its private operations into a for-profit subsidiary , WellPoint Health Networks . Consumers Union , which publishes Consumer Reports magazine , Wednesday accused the Department of Corporations of &quot; secret negotiations &quot; with Blue Cross . It asked Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza to hold public meetings and provide more information about the discussions with Blue Cross . Consumers Union officials said they asked to meet personally with Mendoza to discuss their concerns about the Blue Cross plan but were told that such a meeting could jeopardize negotiations with the insurer . &quot; As a general matter , I don ' t think it ' s helpful to negotiate through the media , &quot; Mendoza said . He said he asked the consumer group to submit its concerns in writing . &quot; These negotiations are about $ 2.5 billion in public funds , and that ' s a lot of money , &quot; said Maryann O ' Sullivan , an attorney at Consumers Union ' s office in San Francisco . &quot; The idea of ( Mendoza ) saying , ' I don ' t want to meet with you because it might jeopardize sensitive negotiations with Blue Cross ' -- I don ' t understand that from a public official. &quot; After Blue Cross decided to form the WellPoint subsidiary , the state opened talks with the insurer about its charitable payments . In exchange for its tax-exempt status , Blue Cross is required to make charitable contributions to public groups in an amount equal_to the value of the assets that were converted to for-profit status . Based on Wednesday ' s stock prices , the 80 % of WellPoint that Blue Cross owns is worth roughly $ 2.5 billion . The state has been pressuring Blue Cross to increase its charitable giving . In May , Blue Cross said it would donate $ 100 million this year to health_care charities . By Sept . 15 , Blue Cross is supposed to submit to the state a plan for meeting its future charitable obligations . Consumers Union said Mendoza should make public the criteria by which it will evaluate the Blue Cross plan . It also asked that future meetings between Blue Cross and the Department of Corporations be open_to the public and that public hearings be held after the plan is submitted . Mendoza said the state is protecting the public ' s interest in its negotiations with Blue Cross . &quot; I can ' t judge my performance based on how I ' m being praised or criticized by any public interest_group , &quot; he said . &quot; I think our department will be judged by our results. &quot;</TEXT>
