   <HEADLINE> U.S. SAFETY GROUP RECALLS CRAYONS MADE IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Tuesday recalled 11 brands of lead-containing crayons imported from China and urged parents who bought them either to throw them away or return them for a refund . Hundreds of thousands of the crayons have been sold at a variety of outlets across the country , the commission said . Three of the brands contain enough lead to pose a poisoning hazard to young children who might eat or chew them . The other eight brands have less lead content but enough to add_to the overall &quot; lead load &quot; of children who might eat them . &quot; Throw these crayons in the trash or take them back to the store for a refund , &quot; said Commission Chairman Ann Brown . She said that parents can be assured crayons are safe if the package contains the label : &quot; Conforms to ASTM D-4236 &quot; or a similar number . The Federal Hazardous Substances Act bans children ' s products containing hazardous amounts of lead , which can cause irreversible brain damage and impair mental function . Commission officials said that crayons made by the nation ' s leading crayon manufacturer , Crayola , also were tested and were found to be safe . A spokesman from Binney &amp; Smith Inc. , the manufacturer of Crayola products , said that the imported crayons represent only 3 % to 5 % of the nation ' s $ 130-million crayon market . The only known case of lead_poisoning from the harmful crayons occurred in Phoenix , where high levels of lead were found in an infant who consumed a Chinese-manufactured crayon that was distributed by Concord Enterprises in Los Angeles . Concord , which distributed &quot; 12 Jumbo Crayons , &quot; already has recalled them in cooperation with the commission . The other two brands deemed most hazardous were distributed by Toys R Us , through its nearly 250 retail outlets , and Glory Stationery Manufacturing Ltd. , which -- like Concord Enterprises -- distributed crayons to various retailers across the country . The Toys R Us crayons were sold as a house brand and labeled as &quot; Safe 48 Non-Toxic I ' m A Toys R Us Kid ! Crayons. &quot; The company said that it would pull the brand from its shelves and issue refunds to buyers who return the crayons . But company officials disputed the commission ' s conclusions and cited independent tests showing that the crayons do not contain dangerous levels of lead . &quot; We are complying with the request of the CPSC and have been taking them ( the crayons ) off the shelves and issuing refunds to persons who return them , &quot; said Carol Fuller of Toys R Us . Glory Stationery Manufacturing said that those tested by the commission were a sample batch that was never sold to the public and that it has none of the tainted crayons in_stock . The other eight brands and distributors of crayons found to have lower levels of lead : * &quot; 64 Crayons , School Quality , No . 8064 , &quot; A . J . Cohen Distributors , Huappauge , N.Y. * &quot; 64 Crayons , No . CR 64-64 CT , &quot; Baum Imports , New York . * &quot; 12 Super Jumbo Crayons , &quot; Dynamic Division of Agora International , St . Albans , N.Y. * &quot; 8 Crayons , No . 5 CL 850 , &quot; Dynamic Division of Agora International , St . Albans , N.Y. * &quot; Fun Time 72 Crayons , No . B541 , &quot; Overseas United , New York . * &quot; 64 Crayons , Kidz Biz , &quot; Bargain Wholesale , Los Angeles . * &quot; 64 Crayons , SKU No . 51-02600 , &quot; Universal International , Minneapolis . * &quot; Feido , 12 Crayons , No . CC8812 , &quot; Kipp Brothers Inc. , Indianapolis . Commission officials said that they would closely monitor any crayons imported from China and would conduct studies on crayons manufactured in other countries as well as the United States .</TEXT>
