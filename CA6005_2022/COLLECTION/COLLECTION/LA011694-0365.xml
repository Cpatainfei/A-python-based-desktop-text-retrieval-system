   <HEADLINE> WHY LAWYER-HATING IS AN AMERICAN PASTIME ; LAW : TOO OFTEN , LEGAL-ETHICS COURSES TEACH STUDENTS THE WIN-AT-ANY-COST APPROACH . IF THE PROFESSION DOESN ' T CLEAN UP ITS ACT , OTHERS ARE LIKELY TO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans hate lawyers because they charge too_much , and earn way too_much . Because they are ruthless adversaries and feckless allies . Because they engage in double_talk , manipulate the judicial_system for their own ends and leave people feeling abused . Because they hide behind noble-sounding ideas -- &quot; serving justice &quot; -- while playing a meaner game . Take lawyer jokes as a source of insight instead of laughs . Americans regard lawyers as base and disloyal ( Q : Why don ' t snakes bite lawyers ? A : Professional courtesy ) . And liars ( Q : How can you tell a lawyer is about to lie ? A : His lips begin to move ) . The lowest of the low ( Q : Why are lawyers buried in deeper graves than other people ? A : Because , deep down , they ' re not so bad ) . A recent survey by the National Law Journal found that only 5 % of American adults want their kids to become lawyers . During the past generation , when the number of lawyers ( now more_than 800 # 000 ) has risen at four times the rate of the nation ' s population , the profession ' s reputation has plummeted even faster . Why ? In part , the legal_profession is paying the price of false expectations built_up for a century and a half . No observation about the profession has been more misleading than Alexis de Tocqueville ' s widely quoted dictum that lawyers make_up an American aristocracy . Lawyers were instrumental in forming America as a rule-of-law nation . But hostility to lawyers , and to the idea of law , is also deep-rooted in the American mind . This is not simply the biblical problem of lawyers drawing criticism for defending the crimes and chicanery of clients . Even in his own time , de Tocqueville was chided for overlooking widespread distrust of the bar ' s dominance , which was definitely warranted . The first major American bar group was formed , in 1870 , expressly to reform the practices of lawyers and to refurbish their honor in the wake of damaging scandals caused by legal corruption in New York City . This century , the bar has been regularly criticized . Prohibition-era lawyers were blamed for the spread of bootlegging and related crimes . Depression-era lawyers were accused of abandoning all but the wealthy . The bar ' s opposition to proposals for independent regulatory_agencies during the New Deal led to charges that it was aligned with big corporations to the detriment of the country . The low point may have come_in the late ' 40s and early ' 50s , with the American Bar Assn. ' s sustained leadership in the national witch hunt for communists . But misconceptions about what lawyers actually do have fueled American disgust far more_than misunderstandings about their role . &quot; Lawyers lull the public into a view of the lawyer ' s role as less client-centered and as more public-interest-oriented than it really is , &quot; said Stephen Gillers , an expert on legal ethics . &quot; The client is the center of the lawyer ' s universe. &quot; The common wisdom among lawyers is that they have a duty to advocate their clients ' interests zealously , no matter what the circumstances , exploiting every advantage -- including the wealth of their clients and the resources it buys . &quot; The difficulty with such an ethic , &quot; said Robert Gordon of Stanford Law_School , &quot; is that it is a recipe for total sabotage of the legal framework. &quot; When law_schools taught legal ethics a generation ago , the courses were usually minor add-ons . At best , they were considered uplifting , at worst , an irrelevant bore . Today , because law_schools are as concerned about the state of the profession as some practitioners , these are major courses . But , even if inadvertently , they often teach a gutter mentality . Instead of imparting respect for the law and a commitment to helping clients comply with the law ' s requirements , legal-ethics courses teach students that it ' s their job to master a negative : what future clients can get_away with , without punishment . They provide a road map for steering around the law ' s requirements , and reflect a cynicism that has increasingly marked U.S. law . Legal ethics have become a paradoxical element of competition among lawyers : Those who practice closest to the line without crossing seem to gain an advantage . For the past decade and a half , leaders of the American bar have been brooding about the problem of the bar ' s character . Yet , many analyses of the &quot; professionalism problem , &quot; as lawyers often call it , boil_down to blaming it on the system -- on the American system of justice that relies_on lawyers arguing as unfairly as possible for their client ' s interests on the theory that the process will yield the highest form of justice . According to these views , bar reform can only come_about if the entire system of justice is changed . The bar association just played the blame game shamelessly , when it announced a plan for convening a high-profile &quot; public jury , &quot; of lawyers and non-lawyers , to consider ways of improving the courts and the profession . &quot; Justice in the United States takes too long , costs too_much and is virtually inaccessible and unaffordable for too many Americans , &quot; intoned a group spokesman . The ABA is right about the system of justice . But , rather than attacking the profession ' s problem , the group is dodging responsibility for it more brazenly than ever . The profession ' s problem has a more immediate solution : self-help . The downward spiral of the bar ' s ethics parallels the general fraying of the social fabric , for which the family is increasingly seen as the locus of repair . The best place to improve the performance of the bar may be at the legal equivalent of the family -- the law_firm . A law_firm is usually led by a senior lawyer who is guided by a committee of peers . It ' s made_up of partners , associates and other types of lawyers . The partners own it and , after paying the firm ' s expenses , split its profits among themselves . The associates do the firm ' s heavy work , and some ( between 10 % and 25 % at big firms ) become partners . The law_firm is seen as the villain in the bar ' s story -- with good reason . Many firms make partners of lawyers who reflect the win-at-any-cost mentality . No matter how high-minded a new associate might be , he or she learns the real values of the profession from hard-edged partners and senior associates . Many firms reinforce this Darwinian lesson by dividing money solely on the basis of worth as measured by a calculator -- how much business a partner generates , how many hours she bills . So they reinforce ethics that have gotten the legal_profession in_trouble . If lawyers don ' t heal themselves , however , they run the risk of having non-lawyers impose standards on them . And if they don ' t fix their profession soon , they run the risk of dragging_down the bar ' s reputation even farther , speeding the likelihood of intervention . Lawyers are_on the verge of getting this -- even if the ABA doesn ' t . At bar meetings , it ' s clear lawyers lack confidence in the values at the core of what they do . That they ' ve never been richer or had more influence over the shape of this society makes the problem epic . The central role of lawyers in American life makes_it imperative for all_of us that the bar resolve its crisis . If it doesn ' t , whether lawyers like it or not , they ' ll get avid help .</TEXT>
