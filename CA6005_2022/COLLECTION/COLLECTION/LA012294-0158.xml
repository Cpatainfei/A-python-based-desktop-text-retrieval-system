   <HEADLINE> PHIL &amp; JIM ' S CHAIN FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY TO REORGANIZE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The long-established Phil &amp; Jim ' s electronics and appliance chain , with debts that exceed its assets by nearly $ 9 million , filed a petition Friday to protect itself from creditors while it reorganizes its finances under federal bankruptcy laws . The 40-year-old Anaheim company ' s petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana lists debts of $ 16 million , about $ 8.9 million of it secured , and assets of $ 7.1 million . The Chapter 11 petition was filed as the company prepares_for a liquidation sale that begins today in five stores that remain open . Company lawyers said manufacturers are supporting the Phil &amp; Jim ' s liquidation sale , which will offer discounts of 7 % to 50 % on all merchandise that was at five other stores the company closed this week . Many items will be sold below wholesale prices , with manufacturers absorbing the differences . The merchandise was moved to remaining stores in Anaheim , Anaheim Hills , Lake Forest , Huntington Beach and Cerritos . The company also is slashing overhead and expects to reduce its staff of 180 to fewer than 80 employees , said Phil Delgado Jr. , company president . Barely four years ago , the chain had about 400 employees at 12 stores in four counties . William N . Lobel , an Irvine bankruptcy lawyer for the company , said Phil &amp; Jim ' s simply grew too quickly and became too far-flung as it competed against large chains like Circuit City . While it matched the big chains ' prices , he said , the public gravitated to the large discounters because they anticipated cheaper prices . &quot; What ' s going_to happen in the next few weeks is that Circuit City is going_to take it in the shorts , &quot; Lobel said , referring to the big chain ' s promise to match all advertised prices . The bankruptcy petition lists 130 # 000 unsecured creditors with potential claims of $ 2.2 million . Most are customers who took_out extended warranties that the company itself offered on electronics and appliances . For now , the company no longer offers extended warranties . About $ 4.8 million more is owed to 338 manufacturers and other vendors . The biggest chunk of secured debt , $ 8.7 million , is owed mainly to Whirlpool , General Electric Capital Corp . and Maytag Corp .</TEXT>
