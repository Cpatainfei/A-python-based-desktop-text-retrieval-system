   <TEXT> The symptoms have swept_through Edgewood Middle_School . By 10 many mornings there is a long line outside the nurse ' s door at the West Covina school . Some children clutch their stomachs . Others grasp their heads . In this mostly middle-class bedroom community , these children share a common ailment . They are hungry . One boy came_into Assistant Principal Amelia Esposito ' s office last year and confessed to stealing food from a 7-Eleven store . &quot; Every night I go_to_bed hungry , &quot; the 13-year-old told her , bowing his head . &quot; There isn ' t enough food. &quot; &quot; It ' s scary how many kids here are hungry , &quot; says Esposito , who believes one in four children comes_to class undernourished . America ' s hunger is not the starvation of Somalia or Rwanda that galvanizes global attention : bloated bellies , emaciated arms , failing bodies along roadsides . Hunger here saps people in more subtle ways ; families eat only once a day or skip meals for several days , causing chronic malnutrition . It is a problem that many researchers say eased markedly in the 1960s and ' 70s , but resurfaced with a vengeance in recent years . Hunger , they say , afflicts up_to 30 million Americans . Twelve million of them are children , many in recession-ravaged Southern California . Their plight has emerged most publicly in the schools , where teachers delve into their own pockets to feed children whose ability to learn is being crippled by hunger . Yet half of California ' s schools -- including all 11 in the West Covina Unified School District -- do not offer one ready remedy : breakfast , a federally funded entitlement . Nationally , 37 % of the 13.6 million low-income children who get a subsidized lunch also eat a morning meal at school . In some districts , breakfast has been barred or eliminated by school officials who oppose it on philosophical grounds . Many in West Covina , where Christian conservatives dominate the school_board , oppose feeding children breakfast at school , calling it anti-family and a usurpation of what should be a parent ' s responsibility . &quot; I want kids to eat_at home with their families , &quot; said school_board President Mike Spence . &quot; Breakfast at school is just one more thing school districts do rather than allowing parents to take_care of their children. &quot; A suburb that blossomed from orange groves in the San Gabriel Valley after World_War_II , West Covina , the &quot; City of Beautiful Homes , &quot; is an unlikely haven for hunger . In the 1980s , however , teachers watched as lost jobs , an influx of newcomers from the inner_city and an increase in single mothers left many students living hand-to-mouth . Although the median family income in West Covina is $ 51 # 000 , there are pockets of poverty : one in four single mothers lives on less than $ 14 # 800 a year . Although the shifts in West Covina are hardly unique , the town ' s emerging economic stratification has made hunger highly visible in the schools . The number of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches at Edgewood , the district ' s only middle_school , has surged to nearly two-thirds from one-third a decade ago . Among them is Cristina Yepez , a soft-spoken 12-year-old with freckles and wide-set blue eyes , who spends some mornings at the school health office complaining of stomachaches . Last year , she says , she got dizzy on the playground , crumpling onto the blacktop at Merced Elementary . She had had no breakfast that day . Dinner the night before was a potato . &quot; A lot of times , we have just bread , &quot; says Cristina , gently combing the silky red hair on her Little Mermaid doll as her family prepares_for an evening ' s meal . &quot; Sometimes , I get really hungry . But there ' s nothing more to eat . I go_to my friend ' s house and pretend to play and say : ' Oh , can I have something to drink ? ' &quot; Cristina sits_down with her mother , Darlene , and sister , Jesseca , 13 , for dinner . It is their only meal today . One hot dog each , and water . Darlene Yepez , 38 , who is divorced , was sidelined from a forklift job by a back injury but is searching for work . Meanwhile , the family survives on $ 607 in welfare and $ 130 in food_stamps , which run_out halfway through the month . Swallowing her pride , the mother has gone_to West Covina ' s food pantry -- but has used her five allowed visits . A few times , the girls have gone_up to three days without food , she says , quietly beginning to sob . The last two weeks , she says , they have had one meal a day . Studies show that hungry students are fatigued . They cannot concentrate . They do worse than their peers on standardized tests . Because they are ill twice as often , they miss class more frequently . &quot; They are dazed . You can see it in their eyes . Sometimes , their hands tremble , &quot; says Edgewood teacher Kim Breen , who estimates that three-quarters of her students arrive without eating breakfast . Some do not have the energy to raise their heads from their desks . One girl broke_down last year in class , her hands shaking , describing how she had gone all weekend without eating . Kathi Jennings sees hunger ' s toll daily at Edgewood , which has about 1 # 800 students . Knowing many of them are undernourished , she keeps a choice of rewards for daily tasks on her desk : a baseball_card , a small toy or a cup of applesauce . Many kids choose food . Two guards who patrol Edgewood ' s playground say one 13-year-old girl chases their green security cart , asking_for food . Physical_education teacher Barbara Davids says she sometimes fed a 12-year-old boy who volunteered to help custodians pick_up after lunch so he could salvage garbage scraps . Another student got_in trouble regularly so he could be sent to the assistant principal ' s office , where a jar of diabetic candies is perched on her desk . &quot; I ' m so hungry . I ' m so hungry , &quot; sobbed the 12-year-old boy , dipping his hand into the jar and stuffing six candies into his mouth . Hunger plagues many U.S. schools . More_than a quarter of elementary schoolchildren come_to class without breakfast , said Doris Derelian , president of the American Dietetic Assn . The Los Angeles Unified School District , like many urban_areas , has long served breakfasts so the problem on those campuses is less pronounced . Rural and suburban districts are less likely to serve a morning meal . In the Baldwin Park Unified District , nearly half of 16 # 000 visits to the school nurse last year were tied to hunger . Since then , the district has started offering breakfast at many of its schools . The mounting toll in schools mirrors a resurgence in hunger , which studies show was brought under_control in the ' 70s but grew by 50 % between 1985 and 1991 . Even for Americans with jobs , a growing percentage -- now nearly one in five -- work full time but earn less than the poverty level . Divorce and out-of-wedlock births left children , along with their mothers , the nation ' s biggest losers . More_than one in five children live_in poverty , and almost a quarter of low-income children in the United States are anemic -- a condition linked to inadequate or poor nutrition . Government cuts have not helped : median Aid to Families With Dependent Children benefits for a family of three have dropped 47 % since 1970 . California food_stamp payments average 70 cents a meal , slightly more_than half of what the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture says it takes_to get an adequate diet . In an effort to assess the extent of hunger in America , the federal_government has launched its first tally on malnutrition . Results from the survey of 60 # 000 households are expected to be released in 1996 . Recent academic research already has focused_on the effects of hunger in the classroom . A 1993 Tufts University study said hunger is stunting cognitive development as lethargic children disengage from learning , and warned that &quot; our country may be heading for a crisis of enormous proportions. &quot; &quot; Health and nutrition are powerful determinants of educational competence , &quot; says Ernesto Pollitt , a UC Davis human development professor . His 1993 study found that anemic and iron-deficient toddlers lag behind their peers in mental development by up_to 25 % . Nonetheless , Pollitt said he is surprised to find that many schools do not serve breakfast and ignore the effects of hunger on the ability to learn . A study of 1 # 023 public schoolchildren in Lawrence , Mass. , found that when schools started to serve breakfast , students ' standardized test scores rose , and absenteeism and tardiness declined . Math , another study shows , is hardest hit when children are not given a morning meal . &quot; Scientific evidence shows that if you don ' t do this , you are undermining the very reason for your existence , which is to educate children , &quot; says J . Larry Brown , director of the Tufts University Center_on Hunger , Poverty and Nutrition Policy . At Edgewood school , mid-morning is the worst , said science_teacher Breen . &quot; How many eat three meals a day ? Two ? One ? &quot; Breen asks her class . Most say they eat twice , some only once . It is her annual informal body_count on hunger , and the results are more grim each year . Breen estimates a sixth of her students are hungry regularly . &quot; I have to repeat instructions two or three times , &quot; she says . &quot; I try to teach them physics , but I can ' t. &quot; By second_period , a boy in the third row drops his head to his desk . &quot; I just leave them alone . They aren ' t going_to get_it , &quot; Breen says , her voice full of frustration . Just before lunch , a 14-year-old girl rises from her desk and slowly approaches her teacher . She says she has not eaten_in two days . Earlier , on the playground , she nearly fainted , dizzy from lack of food . &quot; Could I have 50 cents ? &quot; she says quietly so the other children can ' t overhear . &quot; I ' m hungry. &quot; Breen -- who often gets requests for food -- fishes out four quarters . The girl , who has not yet been issued a card that will allow her to get a free lunch , still lacks enough money to buy one . She eats what she can : a bag of Doritos from the school vending machine . &quot; I keep my own stuff , &quot; says the school health clerk , Deborah Paschal , swinging open the office cabinet . Sandwiched between the Band-Aids and medicines are peanut_butter , crackers and boxes of juice , all purchased with her own money . Counselor Pamela Clausen sometimes gives_away her sack lunch . Physical_education teacher Barbara Davids occasionally brings_in grocery_bags of food . When she runs_out , or does not have money , she sends children to the cafeteria with a note : &quot; Feed this kid. &quot; Throughout Southern California , teachers like Ernie Sanchez are picking_up the slack . When he was a second-grade teacher at Vejar Elementary School in Pomona , Sanchez spent the first_period each morning making cheese sandwiches for every student . If he had no cheese , he scooped a cup of cereal into a napkin on each child ' s desk . Once , he brought apples to the school , where 99 % of the children qualify for free or reduced-price meals . &quot; All these little_hands reached_out toward me , &quot; says Sanchez , who -- faced with the crush of children -- struggled to regain control of his class . &quot; I ' ll take that image to my grave . I didn ' t think I would ever see that in America. &quot; &quot; It has gotten_worse , &quot; says Debbie Norman , a fourth-grade teacher at East Whittier ' s Evergreen Elementary . She worries that math and English , taught first thing in the morning , are most jeopardized . &quot; I have parents tell me : ' I just don ' t have enough to feed them. ' The kids say : ' There is nothing in the house. ' &quot; Her colleague , kindergarten teacher Linda Palmer , could no longer endure the procession of hungry 5-year-olds to her desk . Palmer now passes_out crackers and popcorn to children who come_to class without snacks . Some hungry children come from neglectful or drug-plagued homes . At Edgewood , Assistant Principal Esposito puts the number at one in 10 . &quot; We don ' t have food sometimes , &quot; says one 13-year-old Edgewood student , nervously adjusting her glasses . Asked what her mother does , the girl said , &quot; She stays in the house and watches TV every day. &quot; Her father ? &quot; He takes drugs . that ' s why my mom threw him out. &quot; But most , Esposito says , suffer because their parents have been laid_off , work long hours and leave their children to fend_for themselves in the mornings , or work_at jobs that barely cover the rent . Lisa Drynan , 32 , was recently laid_off from her administrative job at an engineering firm , the second position she ' s lost to &quot; downsizing &quot; in three years . She is again searching for work . Drynan has gone_up to two days at a time without food . Her three boys , Kevin , 3 , Kenny , 9 and Keith , 11 , who attends Edgewood , often eat once or twice a day . The night before , says Drynan , staring inside her bare refrigerator , her three sons split two hot dogs . &quot; There are many days I don ' t have anything for them for breakfast , &quot; she says in her tidy apartment , where the toys are lined_up outside the front_door . Even though she buys generic brand foods , her $ 102 in food_stamps each month run_out after 2 1 / 2 weeks . Drynan , who is divorced , has used_up her five trips to the West Covina food_bank . &quot; I know food is important . But I know we need a roof over our heads more , &quot; she says , adding that most of her income goes_to the $ 690-a-month rent , bills and collection agencies to pay_off thousands of dollars in medical costs owed from one son ' s head injury . &quot; I ' m hungry , &quot; says Kevin , tugging at his mother ' s white T-shirt . Drynan has heard that her 3-year-old ventures to neighbors ' homes , asking_for food . She pulls_out a Popsicle -- the last bit of food in her freezer -- and gives it to Kevin , who consumes the treat in seconds . Kenny , a skinny boy with big brown eyes , laments not having had his favorite food , pork chops , since his birthday in March . At school , he says , &quot; in the mornings , I get real hungry. &quot; By 10:30 , he begins a daily lunchtime countdown , eyes focused_on the classroom clock . Other children sit_down after morning recess for snack time -- a treat from home . &quot; They read us a story , or we do our work . I just have to work . I don ' t have a snack , &quot; Kenny says quietly . &quot; I get hungry when I look_at them. &quot; Drynan knows hunger afflicts other families in her neighborhood , even those in which the parents have jobs . When Drynan sent her children for a sleep-over to Susie Ballard ' s house across the street , they were told to eat supper at their own home , then come_over . Ballard , 38 , whose daughter Kristin attends Edgewood , explains that although she works , she cannot put three meals on the table for her own three children , much less visitors . Ballard , whose marriage broke_up two years ago , lost her longtime job as a pizza company training manager . Work as a cleaning lady barely covers the rent . Half the month , there is no breakfast . Ballard stretches a pack of spaghetti into three meals , thinning down the red sauce with cans of water . &quot; There are nights I tell the kids : ' I ' m not hungry . You eat , ' &quot; says Ballard , nervously smoothing the lace doily on the apartment ' s living room table . She gives the kids Kool-Aid to fill their bellies . Fresh fruit , vegetables and coffee are luxuries of the past . &quot; I tell them : ' If someone offers you a free meal , take it , take it. ' I used to go_to_bed crying every night . I feel a failure to them . I ask : How can they look_up_to me ? &quot; Kristin , 13 , is curled_up in a chair in the corner of the sparsely furnished but immaculate apartment . &quot; If the food was there , I would eat more , &quot; she says shyly . Anti-hunger advocates are waging a coordinated , nationwide campaign in a school-to-school battle to get the tens of thousands of schools without breakfast programs to sign_up . Without breakfast in schools , the $ 16 billion California spends on elementary and high_school education may be wasted money , Assemblywoman Gwen Moore warned in a January letter to colleagues , prodding them to push the program in their districts . Twenty-one states -- including New York and Texas -- now mandate that all or some of their schools serve breakfast . Bills to make breakfast mandatory in California schools have failed , partly because they are viewed by some legislators as coddling immigrant children . In La Habra , a recently implemented breakfast program has made teaching more productive . Morning stomachaches used to afflict half her students daily , said Maria Vigil , a Las Lomas Elementary kindergarten teacher . &quot; They were all nauseous &quot; and lethargic , she said . Her office brimming with more_than a dozen hungry children by midmorning , Las Lomas Principal Mary Jo Anderson found that for 10 % of the students , school lunch was their only solid meal . &quot; If their tummies hurt , their brains can ' t work , &quot; Anderson says . School breakfast , she adds , resulted in a 95 % drop_in disciplinary problems . &quot; They are calm , happy . They aren ' t angry . They aren ' t hurting . It ' s like a miracle. &quot; &quot; Teacher ! I am going_to eat ! &quot; children yell at Vigil as they spill_out of yellow school_buses . Sandra Andrade , 5 , races from the parking_lot , grabs her green meal ticket , then rushes to the wire screen window , waiting impatiently for her tray of milk , juice , cereal and string_cheese . Unemployed father Roberto Andrade -- who some days can ' t scrounge up the gas money to search for work -- hovers over the school breakfast_tables , where four of his children who attend Las Lomas share their food with his other three younger children . &quot; Without this , they might not eat some days , &quot; says the handyman . Three-year-old Eduardo devours a packet of graham_crackers with his sister Sandra . The focus_on food is everywhere . As soon as class starts in Vigil ' s Room 6 , she notices that 6-year-old Jonathan Quintana is irritable and crying . Vigil ' s hand dives into a desk drawer and pulls_out a bag of crackers : &quot; Let ' s get you a little cereal , OK ? &quot; Jonathan is ushered to a table , seated next to his teddy_bear , and given cereal , juice , milk and more crackers . The lesson quickly continues . Jonathan ' s sobs become more infrequent . He sniffles . By 9 , he is seated with the other students , at_work on lessons about the calendar and the weather . As Vigil offers each child an animal cracker from a large jar , Jonathan cheerfully plays with Legos . Even as lunchtime approaches , children attentively listen to Vigil ' s rendition of &quot; The Three Bears , &quot; jostling to see the book ' s pictures . Later , Alberto Cueva , 5 , savors his lunch -- a burrito , followed by corn and milk -- before his half day of school ends . &quot; Sometimes , we eat_at night , &quot; says the boy , urgently shoveling the burrito into his tiny mouth . &quot; Sometimes we don ' t. &quot; About This Series In this series , The Times examines four battlegrounds in the war on hunger in Southern California . * Today : Hungry children , caught in the battles over school breakfast . * Monday : The growing salvage food industry -- spawned by hard_times -- takes a bite_out of charitable food_banks . * Tuesday : U.S. Department_of_Agriculture changes_course and launches a crusade to attract more people to food_stamps . * Wednesday : A one-woman crusade to ease neighborhood hunger , one family at a time . What ' s for Breakfast ? School breakfasts can be hot or cold , and vary from the favorite -- cereal , milk and juice -- to breakfast burritos or breakfast pizzas . Some schools serve breakfast before class , others as a nutrition break , or even on the school_bus . In California , almost 5 # 000 schools offer breakfasts to more_than 600 # 000 students every school_day . Here ' s a look_at some typical costs and numbers : Typical School Menu 8 oz . of milk 4 oz . of juice Fresh or canned fruit Hash-brown potato wedge Cinnamon_roll or bagel with cream_cheese , apple_turnover , fruit-filled pancake , sausage biscuits , burritos . What Does It Cost ? Because of reimbursements from federal and state_governments , school breakfast programs typically don ' t cost a school anything . In fiscal 1993 , those reimbursements included $ 835 million from the federal_government to the states . Here are some of the federal reimbursement rates per meal for 1994-95 : 04 # 22 , 10 # 10 , 28 Severe Need Other Amount Schools Schools Child Pays Free lunch $ 1.16 98 cents Reduced-priced lunch 86 cents 68 cents 30 cents ( maximum ) Full-price lunch 19 cents 19 cents 54 cents ( average in U.S. ) Who Is Eligible ? For a free breakfast : Children from a family of four with annual income of $ 19 # 240 or less . For a reduced-priced breakfast : Children from a family of four with annual income of $ 27 # 380 or less . Who Gets Breakfast ? The percentage of eligible children receiving subsidized breakfast and lunch at school is higher in Los Angeles County than the nationwide average , but it is lower in other Southern California counties : U.S. : 37 % California : 36.5 % Los Angeles County : 41 % Orange County : 20.2 % Ventura County : 15 % San Bernardino County : 15.7 % Riverside County : 20.8 % San Diego County : 24.4 % Assessing Hunger Generally , researchers and the federal_government measure hunger by asking people questions about how often they skip meals , cut the size of meals , or send their children to bed hungry due_to lack of resources . 30 million Americans -- including 12 million children -- fit this category . USDA looks_at what percentage of children eat the government ' s recommended dietary allowance , which measures calories as well as a range of vitamins . In 1985 , 63.7 % of children living below the poverty level consumed an inadequate amount of calories . Hunger can occur without manifesting itself in clinical symptoms , but in the worst cases it can be measured by testing for anemia or growth stunting in children . In 1993 , 18.6 % of low-income children were anemic ; 8.4 % had stunted growth .
