   <HEADLINE> ART NOTES : RUSSIA ' S HERMITAGE OPENS TO THE WORLD ; A HIGH-LEVEL INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN IS UNDER WAY TO ENLIST THE AID OF ART LOVERS IN RENOVATING THE STORIED MUSEUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The woes of St . Petersburg ' s venerable Hermitage Museum are not a Russian state secret . Ever since the mid-1980s when glasnost and perestroika opened the former Soviet_Union ' s doors to Western reporters and loosened the lips of the museum ' s staff , press reports have sounded alarms about crumbling plaster , peeling paint , faulty plumbing and inadequate security -- all_of which endanger one of the world ' s greatest art_collections . But now that a high-level international campaign to upgrade and expand the Hermitage is under way , you are likely to hear much more about the museum ' s problems and how you can help . Send money ? Well , yes . The Hermitage fund-raisers have a goal of raising $ 300 million to $ 400 million to renovate the palatial structure and expand into several nearby buildings now occupied by military facilities . But the campaign also aims to raise awareness of the museum ' s status and to make the venerable institution a more prominent member of a worldwide museum community , according to Hermitage Director Mikhail Piotrovski . Traveling across the United States with representatives of UNESCO and the American Friends of the State Hermitage Museum Inc. , Piotrovski recently stopped in Southern California where he met with cultural leaders and visited the J . Paul Getty Museum , Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Huntington Library , Art_Galleries and Botanical Gardens . &quot; We are developing a new way_of_life at the museum , a more open way , &quot; Piotrovski said in an interview . Part of the process is cultivating &quot; friends who have special connections to the Hermitage or special feelings about it , &quot; he said . The Russian government provides the majority of support for the museum ' s annual operating_budget , contributing $ 4 million of a $ 7-million budget last year and around $ 7 million of this year ' s $ 10-million budget . The government also will be the major contributor to the renovation and expansion project , but gifts must make_up the difference . * &quot; In this new situation we have won our freedom , but we have to pay_for the freedom , &quot; Piotrovski said . Donations also help pressure the government to do its part , he noted . Asking foreigners to help save a national_monument requires Russians to swallow their pride , Piotrovski said . Potential foreign donors , on the other hand , ask why they should support a Russian institution when many of their hometown museums are needy . With its vast international collection of art , the Hermitage symbolizes Russia ' s ability to embrace the world ' s culture , but the museum also belongs_to the world and deserves widespread support , he said . UNESCO is leading the fund-raising_drive and helping to establish foreign Friends of the Hermitage chapters , each of which will adopt a special project . The American Friends was launched last June and promptly gave the museum $ 50 # 000 for a security_system . The group ' s current goal is to raise $ 12 million for a new museum entrance that will provide orientation information and other visitor services . &quot; The new entrance will be much more comfortable and user-friendly , &quot; Piotrovski said . &quot; It ' s quite symbolic of our new attitude. &quot; ALL ' S FAIR : For the first time in nine years , ART / LA isn ' t happening because of the art market ' s continuing slump . But two other contemporary art fairs -- which promise to be more affordable for dealers and collectors alike -- are coming_to Los Angeles , and both are being launched Friday through next Sunday . The Gramercy International Contemporary Art Fair -- a dealer-organized fair whose debut at New York ' s Gramercy Park Hotel last spring was a raging success -- will open in the Southland at Chateau Marmont in Hollywood . For the New York affair , adventurous young dealers installed artworks in hotel-room closets , bureaus , bars and beds , and low-end sales were reportedly brisk . At the upcoming Los Angeles event , about two_dozen galleries will present works by emerging artists on five floors of a landmark hotel , at 8221 Sunset Blvd. , from noon to 8 p.m. each day . Participants include Food House , Sue Spaid and TRI galleries from Los Angeles ; Fawbush , Jay Gorney and Pat Hearn from New York , and Xavier Hufkens from Brussels . The art is for_sale , but there ' s no admission_charge . &quot; Above all , I think it ' s going_to be a lot of fun , &quot; says Santa Monica dealer Christopher Grimes , who plans to display artworks in the living room , bedroom , kitchen and bathroom of his suite . Although the setting has limitations , it allows potential buyers to see art in a homelike atmosphere instead of a clinical art-fair booth , he says . The Gramercy approach is the way to go_in the ' 90s , according to Grimes , because it &quot; takes the pressure off &quot; in an intimate atmosphere that encourages dialogue . The other fair , Art Los Angeles 1994 , will be staged at Los Angeles Convention Center . Organizer John Natsoulas , who owns a contemporary art_gallery in Davis , previously announced plans for a December art fair at Universal Studios . Natsoulas says he switched to the Convention Center because he hadn ' t reserved enough space to accommodate the unexpectedly large_number of dealers who responded . Among the 60 or so participating galleries are Nicholas Treadwell of London , Galerie Liaison Beaux Arts of Paris , Jain Marunouchi of New York and William Turner of Venice , Calif . Artists talks and demonstrations also are scheduled . A $ 35-ticket benefit for the Archives of American Art will kick_off the fair on Thursday , 6-9 p.m. Public hours : Friday , 10 a.m.-10 p.m. ; Saturday , noon-10 p.m. ; next Sunday , 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Admission : $ 8 for a one-day pass , $ 12 for a weekend pass ( good for Saturday and Sunday ) . Yet another event is planned at Santa Monica ' s Broadway Gallery Complex on Saturday , 6-10 p.m. Eleven galleries will present an &quot; Art of Giving &quot; exhibition and sale , with 10 % of proceeds benefiting Inner-City Arts , a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing youths with positive experiences through the arts . Information : ( 310 ) 829-3300 . ROMPER ROOM : Molly Barnes , an art_dealer , consultant and commentator who divides her time between Los Angeles and New York , has advice for all you artists who don ' t know what you ' re doing . In a new paperback book , &quot; How to Get Hung : A Practical Guide for Emerging Artists , &quot; published by Journey Editions , she offers tips on such baffling problems as how to behave at art openings and how to cultivate critics -- and drops plenty of names in the process . As to getting the word out , she counsels artists to give their exhibition press_releases &quot; a tough proof-reading. &quot; However , a press kit advertising her book says that Georgia O ' Keefe ( sic ) was Barnes ' role_model . Moving right along to a chapter called &quot; Look Good Like an Artist Should , &quot; Barnes writes : &quot; Good-looking people get attention in every field and the art world is no exception. &quot; If you don ' t happen to be &quot; naturally appearance conscious , &quot; she offers this : &quot; Get help. &quot; You could , for example , attend a student day at Vidal Sassoon or accept a make-over offer from a cosmetics firm . When preparing_for a dealer ' s visit to your studio , you should provide two chairs , preferably old-fashioned rockers . It ' s OK to wear jeans and a nice T-shirt , &quot; if they are clean and pressed , &quot; she says , but women artists should dress to show_off their figures . CLAY TALK : &quot; West Coast Ceramics , &quot; a panel of ceramic luminaries John Mason , Jim Melchert , Susan Peterson , Paul Soldner and Peter Voulkos , is scheduled for next Sunday , at 2 p.m. , at Scripps College Humanities Auditorium in Claremont . A closing reception for the exhibition &quot; Revolution in Clay : The Marer Collection of Contemporary Ceramics &quot; will follow , from 3-5 p.m. After leaving Scripps , the 50-year survey of ceramic art will travel_to eight museums across the country . The college has published a 176-page color catalogue of the Marer collection , with essays by Kay Koeninger , Mary Davis MacNaughton and Martha Drexler Lynn , in conjunction with the exhibition .</TEXT>
