   <HEADLINE> ICONTROVERSY ; RUSSIAN RELIGIOUS TREASURES ARE FOR SALE AT AN ANAHEIM GALLERY , PROMPTING ETHICAL CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s 1991 decree that Russian religious treasures be returned to the church may seem a distant problem in a distant place . Yet its moral implications reach all_the way to Anaheim , where a collection of 80 icons dating_from the 14th to 19th centuries are_on display , and for_sale , at a commercial_art gallery . &quot; I ' ve had people come_in here and scold us , &quot; said Lori Kaye , owner of the gallery that bears her name . &quot; ' These belong in Russia ! ' they say , ' These belong in the church . They ' ve all been stolen. ' I go_into great depth with them , explaining that they weren ' t stolen per se . Many were legally sold under Communism . Armand Hammer brought_back shiploads ( of icons ) andsold them in department_stores . &quot; These icons have been out of Russia for a long_time . How can you ask people to respond today to what was legal back then ? &quot; Icons are religious paintings created in countries of Orthodox faith , usually by a monk or pious layman who fasted and prayed before working . Images of Christ , Mary and the saints were themselves worshiped and believed to effect cures . Icons have also been massively destroyed throughout history , most recently by the Soviets . The collection at the Lori Kaye Gallery includes a 14th-Century example depicting the life of Elijah priced at $ 35 # 000 , and a 19th-Century triptych once owned by Czar Nicholas II , offered for $ 120 # 000 . An &quot; Ascension of Christ &quot; is offered at $ 395 . All are owned by Svetlana Nenov of Mission Viejo and are being sold on consignment . According to Kaye , Nenov escaped_from the Soviet_Union after World_War_II on a student visa and ended_up in West_Berlin . Soviet diplomats , who could come and go_with impunity , actively dealt in icons at the time , hoping to redeem them for much-needed hard currency . &quot; ( The diplomats ) would go_to Berlin to try to sell their icons , &quot; Kaye said , &quot; but often they ' d be scratched getting them out , or they were broken when a church was destroyed . The icons were often cut_out of the iconostasis wall with a saw , so there ' d be rough edges . &quot; The diplomats had to have the icons cleaned , identified and restored before they could sell them , and Svetlana was an icon restorer . But they only had their local currency to pay her , which she didn ' t need since she was living_in Berlin . So she ' d restore , say , five icons and , by way of payment , keep one or two . Then they ' d sell the rest . &quot; Basically , she built her collection on a trade. &quot; Reached by phone , Nenov responded curtly when asked to confirm the story of how she acquired her collection . &quot; My father ( in Russia ) . . . my mother made the collection -- what ' s wrong with that ? &quot; As to Yeltsin ' s recent request that anyone in possession of icons return them to the Russian Orthodox Church , Nenov said , &quot; ( If ) he will pay me , I will return them . They are mine. &quot; Kaye , who has operated her commercial gallery in Orange County for 10 years , at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers for the last two , continued the story firsthand . * When the hotel hosted a religious conference almost two years ago , she put_out a work by a contemporary Romanian painter and restorer of icons and frescoes , Ioan Sarbu -- &quot; a traditional starving artist &quot; living locally but with little local demand . &quot; How many frescoes need to be restored around here ? &quot; Kaye said . A Fullerton dermatologist bought the icon , then asked if she could also find him older icons . &quot; My husband was born in Bulgaria and had heard of a Bulgarian who was restoring icons ( and who , in turn , ) made the connection to Svetlana , &quot; Kaye said . &quot; The doctor was elated . He ' s active in his church and believed_in the power of icons . He put one in every ( examination room ) . &quot; Nenov ' s collection was recently on display between animation cels of Woody Woodpecker and a lithograph by Winston Churchill ' s daughter , Sara . The legal_status of icons has constantly flip-flopped . Exportation was absolutely illegal at the end of the ' 80s , for instance ; then the &quot; icon border &quot; opened again with the collapse of the Soviet_Union . Yeltsin ' s pronouncement initiated a tug of war between Russian museums , galleries and churches , a holy war of the arts that remains unresolved . &quot; The church has always said that icons are works of reverence and should strictly be used to pray to , &quot; Kaye said . &quot; ( The Communists ) disregarded ( what they felt was ) the church ' s nonsense . . . . They systematically ruined many churches , said the icons were works_of_art and lifted them for museums , strictly for their ' historical significance. ' &quot; Now icons are again ( considered ) religious artifacts rather than works_of_art . The ( art ) historians are screaming , saying the church doesn ' t know how to care_for icons , that they won ' t be kept temperature-controlled , that they ' re going to start burning candles in front of them and pouring hot oils on them , all_the ritualistic stuff that ruins them. &quot; Kaye characterized Nenov as devoutly religious , yet Nenov had made_it clear she had no intention of returning the objects . Kaye could see her point . &quot; It ' s a fine line , &quot; Kaye said . &quot; I look_at it this way . These ( icons ) have changed hands so many times , each time somebody bought them from somebody who bought them from somebody . . . . The church has to recognize that along the way people paid a lot of money for these , that they acted within the laws_of_the_land at the time , that there wasn ' t reverence for icons at the time . If the church wants them back , it should make an offer to buy them. &quot; * The ethical aspect of dealing in such artifacts continues to arise . Kaye said she ' s next planning a buying trip to Poland , where &quot; all these things from synagogues that were desecrated ( under Communism ) are now for_sale . . . . The scrolls , the cover_for the Torah . . . we can pick those things up for $ 100 to $ 500 , artifacts hundreds of years old that technically belong_to somebody ' s synagogue . . . . &quot; They ' re wonderful . How they came ( to be put_up for_sale ) , of course , is so tragic -- I ' d rather see them end_up in the hands of a Jewish family that survived , &quot; she said . Laws in most European_countries prohibit the export of items more_than 50 years old , but Kaye said : &quot; As long as we can get them out , we will . It ' s one of those laws like the speed_limit : Everybody knows it ' s 55 and everybody drives faster , and if you ' re caught . . . the worst that can happen ( in this case ) is confiscation. &quot; * Svetlana Nenov ' s icons remain on display through March at the Lori Kaye Gallery in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers , 777 Convention Way , Anaheim . Hours : 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays ; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays . ( 714 ) 750-3047 .</TEXT>
