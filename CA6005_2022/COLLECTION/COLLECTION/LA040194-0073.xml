   <HEADLINE> ANIMAL PROGRAM MAY MOVE ; WILDLIFE : A SIMI VALLEY REHABILITATION AND RELEASE EFFORT MIGHT FIND A NEW HOME AT THE POINT MUGU NAVY_BASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walk into Jerry Thompson ' s Simi Valley back yard and you won ' t find the prerequisite expanse of green lawn and shimmering blue pool . * Instead , you ' ll find a cramped facility lined with cages and pens of all sizes holding a variety of sick and injured birds and animals . In his nearby garage , you won ' t find the family cars either . Instead , there is the animal version of a MASH unit . &quot; We are nearly out of room here , &quot; said Thompson , who along with his wife , Kathy , co-founded the Raptor Rehabilitation and Release organization . &quot; We ' re already elbow-to-elbow. &quot; But soon , under a proposal jointly conceived by Thompson and Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station environmental officials , Thompson may be able to move to new digs roughly twice the size at the seaside base . Under the plan , Thompson ' s raptor program -- named after the scientific moniker for flesh-eating birds_of_prey -- would occupy an abandoned dolphin-training area on the base near Mugu Lagoon . The nonprofit , all-volunteer organization also works with other animals besides birds_of_prey , such_as shore and marine birds as well as reptiles , deer , raccoons , opossums , foxes and other animals indigenous to the county . Presently , the program assists about 500 animals a year -- more_than 70 % of which are returned to the wild . &quot; We are seeing this as a real opportunity to expand our services while at_the_same_time expose more people to the wonders of these animals , &quot; said Thompson , himself a longtime master falconer . According to Tom Keeney , a Navy ecologist , the proposal gives the service a chance to expand its wildlife interpretation program while utilizing a facility that has been abandoned since the early 1960s when the Navy conducted dolphin research there . At the site , situated near the northern mouth of Mugu Lagoon , five concrete marine mammal tanks of various sizes are now partially filled with dirt and other debris and in various states of disrepair . Nearby , a small trailer that houses a variety of stuffed birds and animals serves as a makeshift Navy wildlife interpretation station -- sharing space with computers and other gear recording data about the lagoon . The proposal , which is still subject_to final approval by base officials , calls_for Thompson ' s group to renovate the Point Mugu facility , build netted aviaries over the tanks and occupy an adjacent building . Also , sick and injured birds and other animals that have been nursed back to health will be_on display during public tours of the facility . Keeney said that about 4 # 000 school-age children and adults take tours of the base ' s wildlife interpretation program each year , and that the idea of combining the two efforts seemed a natural match . &quot; I think we ' re very excited about this , &quot; Keeney said . &quot; Jerry is perfect for this kind of collaboration -- he ' s an expert in rehabilitation and extremely skilled in animal interpretation . His live animal presentations are excellent. &quot; Keeney said the Navy ' s primary contribution to the effort will be in providing the land , and it may also provide the nonprofit group with some help in renovating electrical equipment and plumbing . &quot; The rest will be up_to them , although we will help them whenever we can , &quot; Keeney said . &quot; By the interest shown already by our employees , I don ' t think they ' ll have trouble finding volunteers to run the place. &quot; The addition of the raptor group fits nicely into the Navy ' s Natural_Resources Management Plan , according to Ron Barrett , environmental protection specialist . Barrett said the management plan calls_for the careful monitoring of all plants , animals and ecosystems that make_up the lagoon and surrounding area -- one of the last remaining salt marshes in the state . &quot; It ' s going_to be a tremendous help because there will be more eyes and ears out there , &quot; Barrett said . &quot; With downsizing , we can ' t hire new people . Consequently , there are a lot of programs we can ' t do because we don ' t have the personnel . Jerry ' s organization will go_a_long_way toward helping us . His program really complements our efforts. &quot; For Thompson , who runs his program on a little less than $ 25 # 000 a year in contributions from the public , relocating to Point Mugu means that he will be able to show more people the wonders of animals they might not ever have a chance to see up close . Working with scores of volunteer veterinarians and other wildlife specialists , Thompson ' s program , which is licensed by the state Fish and Game Department and the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , helps nurse back to health eagles , hawks and a variety of other birds_of_prey . Thompson said that process sometimes means reteaching the animals their hunting skills so they can survive again in the wild . He said it also sometimes means making more room in his facility for an animal that because of injury or illness will never again be able to fend_for itself in the wild . At the same time , a major focus for Thompson is educating the public on wildlife . &quot; The animal rehabilitation is just as important as the educating that we do , &quot; said Thompson , who does hundreds of animal presentations each year . &quot; What we teach first and foremost is respect for the animals . Without that , why go_on ? &quot; The arrival of the animal rehabilitation center_on the base would ultimately be an intermediate step toward the eventual creation of an estimated $ 7-million native wildlife interpretive center to be situated off-base on California 1 near Mugu Rock . But until then , Thompson and Navy officials said they hope to be able to start renovations this spring and open the new on-base facility by late summer .</TEXT>
