   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : TEENS TURN TO RADIO FOR PROP . 187 VOICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many teen-agers who protested Proposition 187 by staging walkouts from school campuses also turned_to radio_stations like Burbank ' s POWER 106 to get their message across . Youngsters who might be more likely to call a radio_station to make a &quot; shout_out &quot; to a friend instead telephoned popular_music stations to express their opinions , both pro and con , and to educate themselves about Proposition 187 . &quot; I noticed the kids were starting to find_out about 187 and there was a spark in their minds , &quot; said POWER 106 disc_jockey Dave Morales , who hosted a show on the proposition . &quot; I was surprised at how educated they were , &quot; said the station ' s program director , Michelle Mercer . A telephone poll was conducted by the station Monday night in which more_than 76 # 000 people voted for or against the proposition . &quot; I was also surprised at how polarized our audience was , &quot; said Mercer , who explained that POWER ' s listeners are about 60 % Latino . The respondents favored Proposition 187 &quot; by a slight margin , &quot; she said . Morales said he received several faxes and calls from students asking him to announce walkouts from schools that were scheduled , but he chose not to mention them on the air . Instead , the station set_up a toll-free hot_line , the Power_Line , during the week before the election , where people could leave a message stating their views on Proposition 187 . The station aired some of the recorded messages after screening them , Mercer said . Morales said of the thousands of messages that were left , one was by a couple_on two phones . The pair could be heard quarreling over the measure . MAKI BECKER</TEXT>
