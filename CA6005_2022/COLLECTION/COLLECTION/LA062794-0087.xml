   <HEADLINE> U.S. LEADERS KICK OFF LATIN_AMERICAN TOUR ; TRADE : DELEGATION IS LED BY COMMERCE_SECRETARY RONALD H . BROWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Accompanied by a delegation of U.S. corporate leaders , Secretary_of_Commerce Ronald H . Brown kicked_off a five-city , three-country Latin trade mission Sunday by bringing American and Brazilian business people together in a series of meetings . Brown , whose 22-member delegation includes the heads of such Fortune 500 companies as MCI , Hughes Aircraft , UNISYS Corp . and Comstat , also met in a closed-door session with ranking Brazilian officials and Raytheon President Dennis J . Picard to urge acceptance of a bid by Raytheon for a $ 1-billion government project to protect the Amazon . Brown is the second Clinton Cabinet member to visit Latin_America within a month . Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy last month toured Mexico , Argentina and Brazil , where he offered to sell American wheat with 98 % financing in an effort to undercut sales efforts by Germany , Canada and Argentina . Brown , whose tour also includes Argentina and Chile , said the trip reflects the U.S. commitment to increased trade between the United States and Latin_America , currently America ' s &quot; fastest-growing export market. &quot; &quot; American exports to Latin_America have doubled since 1985 , accounting_for 900 # 000 American jobs , &quot; Brown said . &quot; By 2003 , we think exports to Latin_America will account_for another 2 million jobs. &quot; Brown said the delegation chose to visit Brazil , Argentina and Chile because those three countries account_for 45 % of a regional economy that &quot; is growing twice as fast as the European economy. &quot; &quot; In short , &quot; he said , &quot; the Latin_American economy is booming. &quot; Brown is concentrating most of his efforts in Brazil , which has struggled for the past 10 years with runaway inflation but still represents the world ' s eighth-largest economy and 30 % of the gross_domestic_product of Latin_America . Brown stressed that Brazil must lower its trade_barriers , privatize more of its industries , such_as the government-run telecommunications industry , and pursue economic reform . Brown said he hopes to end the visit with signed contracts between companies on the tour and South_American companies . Of greatest importance , he said , is the Raytheon project . Raytheon Co. , a Lexington , Mass.-based defense_contractor which produces the Patriot missile , is competing with a French consortium to provide air traffic_control equipment , satellite and technicians to keep track of air traffic over Brazil ' s Amazon forest to protect against environmental damage , poachers and drug_traffickers .</TEXT>
