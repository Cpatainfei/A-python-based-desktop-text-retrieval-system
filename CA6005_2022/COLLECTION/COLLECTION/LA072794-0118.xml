   <TEXT> The leaders of the Middle_East , their age and ailments increasingly upon them , are pushing hard to leave their nations a patrimony of peace . As he addressed the U.S. Congress in Washington on Tuesday , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin spoke alternately as a political_leader , as a commanding general and , perhaps most movingly , as a grandfather hoping that future generations of Israelis will not know the war , the bloodshed and the trauma of day-in , day-out terror that past generations have . Turning_to Jordan ' s King Hussein , Rabin said in his rumbling , gravelly voice : &quot; Your Majesty , we have both seen a lot in our lifetimes . We have both seen too_much suffering . What will you leave to your children ? What will I leave to my grandchildren ? &quot; I have only dreams to build a better world , a world of understanding and harmony , a world in which it is a joy to live , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; This is not asking_for too much. &quot; Hussein ' s eyes misted_over as he looked_out at his wife , Queen Noor , and one of his sons in the audience . Witness as a teen-ager to his grandfather ' s assassination by a Muslim fanatic opposed to peace with the Jews , Hussein had been equally persuasive , and poignant , when he spoke_of freeing his people -- and his neighbors -- from the burden of hostility and hatred . &quot; Although we have labored for so_long under conditions of hostility , I am certain we can see these conditions for what they are -- emblems of an unnatural and sinister state , &quot; Hussein said . &quot; We have all known the portents of that state -- the fear of death , the silence of isolation -- and we have all felt the fear that has mesmerized us , preventing us from moving forward to create together a bright future for the coming generations . &quot; What we are witnessing today , God willing , is a progression from a state_of_war to a state of peace , &quot; he said . Although intensely personal and far from the hardened political considerations of most of their decisions , such are the motivations of Rabin and Hussein and of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad . They are all men who are worried about the legacies they will leave their nations and their people . There are objective factors_in the growing momentum for peace in the region : the end of the Cold_War , the defeat of Iraq in the Persian_Gulf_War , the conflict between militant Islam and secular societies , the diminished value of Arab oil exports . But the commitment of the current generation of leaders has given the peace process a personal character not seen since the time of the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat . This makes the health and life_expectancy of each leader increasingly important elements in the region ' s politics -- and in their own calculations . Hussein , 59 this year , is recovering from cancer and spoke openly Tuesday of using &quot; the years left to me &quot; for peace . Rabin , 72 , shows no desire to slow_down and even looks_forward to another term as prime_minister , but his lifetime in war and politics has exacted a heavy physical toll . Arafat , who will soon be 65 , is clearly fatigued and in questionable health after years as the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s guerrilla commander . And Assad , 64 , survived a massive heart_attack a decade ago but is rumored now to be suffering from new , life-sapping illnesses . Singly and together , they bear the responsibility -- the destiny -- of leading their nations to peace , of ending the hostilities that have occupied them for decades and of setting the course into the next century . Each of them speaks often of that burden , and it has become a clear bond among them , even when they are frustrated by the others . Some of the motivations could be viewed critically -- a resolve to recover territory lost in war ( Assad ' s loss of the Golan Heights in 1967 ) or to rectify past misjudgments ( Hussein ' s decision to join the 1967 war ) , a desire to put themselves &quot; right before history. &quot; There is the determination , as well , not to leave the Arab-Israeli conflict to a new generation to settle , largely in the belief that the older generation with its experience of past wars , tense truces and abortive negotiations knows better how to establish a real and lasting peace for the region . &quot; One cannot say ' now or never ' of the Palestinian revolution , for its victory is inevitable , &quot; Arafat said last week . &quot; But we cannot leave the Palestinian crisis to the future to cure somehow in the way it was left to us by our fathers . &quot; The Palestinian nation , &quot; he added , &quot; cannot squander another generation of our youth -- not when it is within our power to achieve independence and peace. &quot; But even more powerful are the motives expressed so movingly and so frequently in personal terms -- the fervent hope that their grandchildren will not know the wars and bloodshed they have known , that the next generation will prosper once freed from the cycle of preparing , fighting and recovering from war only to begin again . &quot; We bear the responsibility , &quot; Rabin said in his address to Congress . &quot; We have the power to decide , and we dare not miss this great opportunity , for it is the duty of the leaders to bring peace and well-being to their peoples. &quot;</TEXT>
