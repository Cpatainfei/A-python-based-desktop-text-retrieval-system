   <HEADLINE> GAYS LOOK_BACK ON A BUMPY YEAR -- AND AHEAD TO A BUMPY ' 94 ; FAVORABLE COURT RULINGS MADE UP FOR UNFAVORABLE POLICY DECISIONS . BUT AN ACLU LAWYER SAYS THE MOVEMENT IS ONLY NEARING THE HALFWAY POINT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last year began with much hoopla about the waxing political strength of gay_men and lesbians . Instead it turned_out to be a time of painful political defeat on Capitol_Hill -- and of a surprising string of court victories hailed by many as a watershed in gay rights law . Across the country , state and federal judges ruled_in favor of gays in a series of decisions involving marriage , the military , anti-gay rights initiatives and custody_cases . Although by no means the final word in most of the cases , the rulings offered the gay movement its most tangible advances in 1993 . &quot; From the point_of_view of the gay and lesbian community , the various court decisions are a remarkable and miraculous vindication of the positions we have held for many years , &quot; said J Craig Fong of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund , founded 20 years ago to litigate gay rights cases . &quot; These rulings provide the rationale for making gay and lesbian simply another adjective to describe a person and not a basis for discriminating. &quot; While Congress and the Pentagon were blocking repeal of the military ' s ban on gays , federal judges were pronouncing the policy unconstitutional and irrational in opinions extraordinary for their sharply worded rejection of anti-gay discrimination . In five cases last year , courts_ordered the military to reinstate gay service members or halted their discharge . In Hawaii , the state Supreme Court cracked open the door to gay marriage when it revived a lawsuit challenging the state prohibition of same-sex marriages . A state judge in Colorado struck_down an initiative forbidding the adoption of gay-rights laws . Pending trial , a federal judge in Ohio blocked enforcement of a similar measure approved by Cincinnati voters in November . High_courts in both Vermont and Massachusetts approved adoptions by gays . &quot; I think this year was a turning point for gay law , &quot; said William B . Rubenstein , a gay-rights attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and editor of a recent book on gay law . &quot; Increasingly the courts are becoming a haven for constitutional protections from prejudicial public policy-making. &quot; Legal experts describe the judicial gains as not only the product of years of groundwork by gay-rights attorneys but also the inevitable seepage of evolving public_opinion into the courtroom . Even the bruising political fight over the military policy worked its way into recent court decisions to gays ' advantage , advocates say . &quot; Although we didn ' t win in Congress , we certainly shifted the debate that was going_on , &quot; said ACLU attorney Jon Davidson . &quot; The issue became reframed as a serious issue about equality . . . . What happened in the political_arena really redefined the terms of the debate legally. &quot; The volume of gay rights cases also is growing , both because more gays are open about their sexual orientation and are willing to press such claims and a greater number of major law_firms are willing to handle their cases . And cases are being taken more seriously by courts than in the past , when lawsuits were often tossed_out by judges before reaching trial . Yet gay-rights attorneys are hardly trumpeting victory . &quot; I think all_of this comes against a backdrop of years and years of tough going , so we ' re clawing our way to_the_point of midway , &quot; said Rubenstein . &quot; I think the road ahead will be bumpy . There will certainly be victory in 1994 , but defeats as well. &quot; In fact , there were defeats in 1993 . A Virginia judge declared a woman an unfit mother because she was a lesbian . And a federal judge ruled that the Georgia attorney_general ' s office could refuse employment to a lesbian attorney who took_part in a wedding_ceremony with her partner . Looming above everything is the question of the U.S. Supreme Court , which has only taken_up one major gay rights case , Bowers vs . Hardwick in 1986 . The court then upheld Georgia ' s criminal sodomy law , concluding that the constitutional right_to_privacy did not protect gay sexual conduct . The Supreme Court has never directly ruled on equal protection claims made by gays . &quot; We ' re going to get a Supreme Court ruling one of these days , and I don ' t think the trend of decisions in the lower ( court ) cases tells you very much &quot; about what it will be , said Stanford_University law professor William Cohen . The Bowers decision and the relatively conservative nature of the current court make gay-rights proponents nervous about Supreme Court action . &quot; I hope we can avoid taking cases to the Supreme Court until it gets reconfigured some more , &quot; said Janet E . Halley , a lesbian legal scholar at Stanford . &quot; I don ' t know what would happen . But I don ' t want to find out. &quot; Even if gays do lose another major case before the Supreme Court , advocates say the state courts will provide other opportunities . Despite the Bowers ruling , for instance , there have been decisions striking down sodomy laws on the grounds that they violate state constitutions . The cases that may well reach the Supreme Court first are the military ones , where gays are perhaps on the shakiest ground because of the historic deference the court has granted the military in policy and rule making . &quot; The military cases have been great , but I don ' t think they ' re going to hold_up , &quot; warned Matt Coles , an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California . His pessimism stems partly from the reasons underlying last year ' s decisions favoring gays : that the government failed to prove a &quot; rational basis &quot; for its discrimination against gay service members . Coles believes the Supreme Court chipped_away_at that line of argument last year in a case involving commitment of the mentally_ill , when the justices seemed to grant considerable leeway to government entities in meeting the &quot; rational basis &quot; standard . Fong , on the other hand , sees encouraging signs_in the lower courts ' reliance on the rationality test . He notes that it gave the judges a vehicle for declaring discrimination against gays unconstitutional without having to find that homosexuals belong_to what is known in legal jargon as a &quot; suspect classification &quot; -- such_as race or national origin -- deserving of greater legal protection . It would be nice if gays were granted that designation , he says , but the judges ' willingness to rule_in favor of gays without taking that step opens other legal avenues . Indeed , last year ' s decisions followed various legal paths . The Hawaii court concluded that the state ban on same-sex marriage amounted to gender discrimination . The Colorado decision threw_out the anti-gay rights initiative on the grounds that the measure interfered with gays ' right to participate in the political process . Of the 1993 rulings , gay-rights attorneys seem most confident that the Colorado decision will be upheld . Not only have courts overturned similar measures in recent years , but advocates contend the initiatives blatantly target gays . For their part , gay-rights opponents insist they will ultimately prevail . &quot; I don ' t look_at ( the decisions ) as a real setback at all , &quot; said Robert Skolrood , executive_director of the National Legal Foundation , a conservative public interest_group that helped draft the language of the anti-gay rights initiatives in Colorado and Cincinnati . &quot; I think they ' re treading on really thin ground. &quot; Skolrood argues that the Colorado ruling &quot; created out of whole cloth a new right that federal law or U.S. Supreme Court decisions haven ' t given anyone. &quot; Heartened by the Colorado court ' s refusal to declare gays a protected class , Skolrood also dismissed any notion that the decisions would slow attempts to put initiatives before voters in other states .</TEXT>
