   <HEADLINE> EX-GOVERNOR KIDNAPED BY MEXICAN REBELS IS RELEASED ; REVOLT : HE IS HANDED_OVER AT THE FIRST KNOWN MEETING OF CHIAPAS INSURGENTS WITH MEDIATORS . HIS FREEING CLEARS THE WAY FOR PEACE TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Indian rebels late Wednesday released a former governor held hostage since Jan . 2 , clearing the way for peace talks between the insurgents and the Mexican government . Seventy-year-old Absalon Castellanos was turned_over to government peace negotiator Manuel Camacho and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz in the first known meeting between the mediators and the rebels . The hand-over took_place in Guadalupe Tepeyac , on the edge of rebel-held territory in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas . The town has been declared a neutral zone . &quot; We are keeping our promises as men of honor , &quot; said Maj . Moises as he and four other uniformed rebels released the gaunt but fit-looking Castellanos . The rebels had said in a communique Tuesday that they were releasing Castellanos &quot; for the purpose of promoting the prompt initiation of dialogue for peace and dignity that all Mexicans desire. &quot; Both Camacho and the rebels have said that delays in starting the talks have been_due to the logistics of arranging security . However , the government was also clearly uncomfortable starting negotiations while the rebels held Castellanos hostage . As a former general and a rancher as well as a politician , Castellanos symbolizes the ruling elite of Chiapas and many of the reasons for the rebellion . He was considered a hard-liner during his term in office from 1982 to 1988 , unwilling to negotiate with protesters who wanted ranchers to give over some of their privately held land to expansion of local peasants ' semi-communal farms . The rebels have said that they took_up arms only after peaceful means of protest , such_as demonstrations , failed to effect change . Castellano was kidnaped at his ranch in Chiapas , a state bordering Guatemala , the day after guerrillas calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army took_control of four towns . When the army approached , the rebels quickly withdrew into the jungle , taking Castellanos with them . His family held a press_conference demanding that the government take responsibility for any ransom demands . No demands came . Instead , the Zapatistas issued a communique saying that Castellanos had been sentenced to life at hard labor , hauling wood and water , because he had mistreated people . However , the sentence was commuted , they added , to allow Castellanos to be traded for people then imprisoned under accusations of having participated in the uprising . Three weeks ago , 38 of the 70 people held_in prison in_relation_to the uprising were released on bail paid by the state_government .</TEXT>
