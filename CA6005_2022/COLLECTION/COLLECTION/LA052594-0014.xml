   <HEADLINE> PLATFORM ; EVOLVING DEMOCRACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tian An Men was a democratic movement . The new democratic tide started from the Democracy Wall period of 1979 ; at that time it was only in the education and awareness stage . . . But only 10 years later , in 1989 , nearly everyone acknowledged that more democracy was needed.That is progress . . . . Confucianism creates an undemocratic society based on obedience , but the system is only superficially stable . If people cannot express ideas , vent dissatisfaction , then you have a basically unstable system that cannot correct itself . Democracy is geared to involve more people , it is suited to human nature . The one thing we don ' t need is another dynasty . Democracy is a path ; it is not based on grabbing power , but must develop gradually . Even people from the Chinese Communist_Party will provide key support ; we have to coexist with different ideas . The actual structure of the system may_not resemble the structure of a Western democracy , but the underlying principles will be the same . . . . If the Chinese government makes a big improvement in the human-rights situation , then continuing ( most-favored-nation status ) is appropriate . But if big improvement is not made , MFN should not be continued . In all likelihood , if the communists get MFN in_hand , they will turn_around and start to arrest the activists , their so-called enemies . Under these circumstances , China should not get MFN , even though denial will cause hardship for the Chinese people . If the people are not guaranteed basic human_rights , then the loss is even greater . . . .</TEXT>
