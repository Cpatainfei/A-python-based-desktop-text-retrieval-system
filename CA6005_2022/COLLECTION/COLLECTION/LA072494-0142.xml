   <HEADLINE> RETHINKING IMMIGRATION : INTENT MUST SHAPE POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In many ways , the debate over the &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative could better be described as the &quot; Same Old Stuff. &quot; Although the share of foreigners in the total U.S. population is only half of what it was at the turn_of_the_century , the Draconian initiative demonstrates that , in times of economic stress , immigrants still serve as convenient scapegoats . Yet , advocates of legal immigration should not neglect the legitimate issues raised by SOS . To that end , they need to determine the intent of new immigrants and how that affects their adopted communities . Short of that , the immigration debate will continue to be waged in a rhetorical fog . From a policy point_of_view , the question of intent divides immigrants into two classes . The first , and probably the vast majority , seeks to become citizens and integrate into the mainstream of American society . The second , mostly illegal , consists_of temporary sojourners whose interest is to make enough money here to return home_in improved circumstances . The question of intent transcends the current , virtually actuarial debate over the economic effects of illegal immigration . After all , studies on both sides can argue , with varying degrees of persuasiveness , the relative dollars-and-cents merits of this generation of illegal immigrants . Instead , the focus should be_on the probable long-term consequences of large_numbers of undocumented , unassimilated people in the midst of an already highly charged multiracial society . This means addressing forthrightly the issue of legality . Most immigration advocates seem reluctant to do this . To a large extent , their reticence is a response to the broad-brush attacks of nativists . Not surprisingly , a New York Times / CBS News poll last summer revealed that 68 % of all Americans thought most immigrants were here illegally . In truth , there is only about one illegal immigrant for every three permanent legal newcomers . Equally disappointing is the immigration activists ' failure to acknowledge the critical differences between potential citizens and sojourners . Accepting illegality as a quasi-permanent and legitimate condition is tantamount_to tolerating the creation of a &quot; parallel society , &quot; in which immigrants stay , usually for economic reasons , for a prolonged period without ever being expected to become full-fledged members of the larger society . The embryo of such a &quot; parallel society &quot; exists in Europe , where large_numbers of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle_East live_in a kind of non-citizen nether world . Considered virtually unassimilable by many Europeans , they are a source of growing urban unrest as well as easy targets for far-right groups . To many Americans , large populations of illegal immigrants and growing separatist tendencies among ethnic minorities presage a similar scenario here . Their anxieties are stoked when the legitimacy of citizenship is challenged by immigrant advocates who suggest that states such_as California are little more_than &quot; stolen &quot; provinces from Mexico and thus have no moral claim to control their borders . Stressing cultural separateness rather than the traditional integrationist model also contributes to the rise of an parallel society . This is most evident in attempts to institutionalize publicly funded bilingual education . Initially designed to accelerate the learning of English , bilingual education is increasingly used as an agent of &quot; reinforcing ethnic identity , &quot; according to one education official in New York . The final step toward creation of a parallel society is the contention that voting_rights should be extended_to immigrants on issues that most directly affect them , such_as who runs the school_board . This approach dramatically departs from a tradition that has worked remarkably well_over the generations : Most private ethnic , cultural and religious organizations have defined their primary mission not as promoting &quot; group rights &quot; but as easing the entry of newcomers into the broader linguistic , political and economic mainstream . Particularly important in this regard is public education . In the past , public_schools were not expected to serve as incubators of ethnic identity but as training grounds to prepare youngsters for a successful life within the predominant , English-speaking society . During the last great wave of immigration , public education did yeoman ' s work in helping the children and grandchildren of Calabrian paisanos or refugees from Eastern European shtetls match and then overcome students whose families had been resident here for centuries . Although today ' s realities are different in many respects , most available evidence suggests that the bulk of immigrants are willing and eager to become assimilated . This is especially true of children . More_than two-thirds of immigrant children living_in San Diego , and greater than four-fifths of them in South Florida , prefer English to their parental or any other foreign language , according to a recent study of census data by sociologists Ruben Rumbaut and Alejandro Portes . More_than 90 % of them possess &quot; very high &quot; knowledge of English . Generally speaking , their survey revealed that most immigrant children want to succeed in mainstream society , with three-quarters aspiring to careers as professionals or business people . When intent is factored in , the differences in academic performance can be startling . Asian immigrants , including Indochinese , have an extraordinarily high propensity to become citizens and integrate into the mainstream society . Their children routinely outperform native-born students , often by wide margins , and spend more time on homework . By contrast , many Latinos , whether from Central_America , the Caribbean or Mexico , often see themselves more as sojourners than future Americans and look_forward to returning to their countries_of_origin . Their children ' s academic records tend to be average to below average . These kinds of differences underscore the need for the immigration debate to become more sensitive to the intentions of immigrants as a key factor_in shaping policy . In short , newcomers who ultimately seek to become citizens should be treated differently from those who plan to eventually return to their homes . In this regard , perhaps the most vexing and difficult changes in policy would involve access to public_services . Expansion of welfare benefits to newly naturalized Americans represents one of the most potent issues in the quiver of nativists , who seek to parley newcomer dependency on welfare into closed borders , even to legal migrants . Tightening legal immigrants ' eligibility for welfare and social benefits is one way to deal with this problem . Or , to take another case , the citizen sponsors of parents and relatives who wish to come here would have to agree to assume some responsibility for their care . In the case of sojourners , restrictions on access to public_services should be more severe . As essentially &quot; guest workers , &quot; their residency should be exclusively tied to their employment status and their employers made responsible_for their medical as well as education needs . This would encourage the migration of younger workers -- if there is a demonstrated need -- and discourage that of workers whose contributions are minimal . Under such reforms , the picture of the border would change . For one thing , strict enforcement , such_as is now in place in El Paso , would be a prerequisite . But , more important , the expansion of a kind of &quot; guest worker &quot; program would leave prospective illegal migrants a legal , and respectable , alternative in finding work inside the U.S. economy . Making such distinctions between sojourners and long-term immigrants with ambitions to become citizens will not be easy or particularly pleasant . But if those who believe_in immigration do not soon gain the courage to make such distinctions , we can expect an ever less sympathetic public response to the addition of newcomers to our society. *</TEXT>
