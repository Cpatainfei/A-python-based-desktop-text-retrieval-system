   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS : NAKED TRUTHS ; NOTHING MAKES A PERSON MORE VULNERABLE THAN SEXUAL CONTACT . BUT that ' s PRECISELY WHEN HONEST COMMUNICATION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN A RELATIONSHIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The problem isn ' t getting naked . It ' s getting candid . When it comes_to sex , nothing is more revealing -- and scarier -- than an honest conversation with your partner about sexual_desires and dislikes , feelings and fears . Just ponder one revelation in the most recent and , many claim , most reliable national sex study : More_than 22 % of the women claimed they ' ve been forced into a sexual act , yet fewer than 3 % of the men admitted to sexually coercing a woman . This gap in perception &quot; tells me that there is limited communication about sex between partners , &quot; says sociologist Edward Laumann , one of four social_scientists who conducted the University of Chicago study of 3 # 432 randomly selected 18-to-59-year-olds . &quot; It ' s clear each gender has different ideas about sexual matters. &quot; Which is hard to believe_in a society that has turned the unmentionable into the inescapable . We may_not talk with our partners about sex , but we can ' t stop talking_about it everywhere and with everyone else . In a Westwood sandwich shop , two 40ish men debate the pros and cons of giving a vibrator as an anniversary present . In a La Jolla hotel lobby , a pair of 60ish couples compare their favorite sexual positions . Despite the so-called sexual revolution , &quot; Couples in sexual_relationships work too hard to avoid talking_about sex on an intimate level , &quot; says Judith Wallerstein , who has researched relationship issues for 25 years as founder of the Center for the Family in Transition , in Northern California . Nothing makes a person more vulnerable than flesh-on-flesh contact . Emotions are raw . Physiological responses -- or the lack of them -- can be embarrassing , even maddening . Religious and cultural attitudes about sex often instill shame in the individual and confusion in the couple , says psychologist Tibor Jukelevics , who specializes in relationship counseling and directs the Center for Family in Torrance . &quot; It ' s hard enough for a lot of people to think_about sex without feeling bad . Talking_about it seems impossible and very scary. &quot; And , so , one reasons , &quot; Why risk humiliation by telling my partner what my body likes ? &quot; says psychotherapist Bonnie Maslin , author of &quot; The Angry Marriage : Overcoming the Rage , Reclaiming the Love &quot; ( Hyperion , 1994 ) . &quot; It ' s much easier to talk_about sex when it concerns other people -- like John and Lorena Bobbitt. &quot; A 1994 study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that adults are becoming more accepting of sexually explicit content in the mass media . In fact , experts say this increasing &quot; overexposure , &quot; which thrives in entertainment hubs like Southern California , makes_it more difficult for couples to talk_about sex . &quot; Nothing is left to the imagination , &quot; explains Pepper Schwartz , a sociologist at the University of Washington and former president of the national Society for the Scientific Study of Sex . &quot; This causes some to lose touch &quot; with their sexuality . Especially when couples compare their sex lives to fictitious ones portrayed by entertainers , says Schwartz , author of &quot; Peer Marriages : How Love Between Equals Really Works &quot; ( Free Press , 1994 ) . Then , &quot; they worry about being normal. &quot; They shouldn ' t , suggests the University of Chicago report . It found that most adults are conservative in their sexual behavior . &quot; That makes me feel a little more normal , &quot; says Don , a 26-year-old auto mechanic who lives_in the San Gabriel Valley . &quot; You hear about other people having continuous , passionate , unbelievable sex . Then you feel inadequate when you just have really good sex once a month , if even that . &quot; You don ' t say anything because it would be like admitting you ' re lousy in bed , &quot; says Don , who has been married for nine months . &quot; Also , you don ' t want to hurt the other person ' s feelings . It ' s easier to brag to my friends about sex and keep quiet with her. &quot; Don ' s silence has spread to other parts of his marriage . &quot; We ' re drifting . We don ' t have much sex anymore . We can ' t talk_about anything anymore. &quot; He probably bristled_at any talk beyond the superficial , experts theorize . &quot; Simple communication problems affect sexual_relationships , &quot; says William H . Masters , director of the Masters and Johnson Institute in St . Louis and author of numerous books and studies on sex . They can also crush relationships . A few years ago , a survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited lack of communication , including sexual , as a leading cause of divorce . Marilyn Fithian , co-director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Studies in Long_Beach , recalls helping a woman who had an embarrassing problem that ruined her relationships : All her former husbands and lovers became impotent . The woman , in her mid-40s , expressed her self-anger at her partners by mocking their sex techniques . The men communicated their insecurities physiologically . &quot; Things didn ' t improve until the woman talked_about her anger , &quot; Fithian says . &quot; She had to take responsibility for her sexual problems . Sex is hard work. &quot; Too many people falsely believe good sex happens naturally , Fithian explains . &quot; They feel_like something is wrong if they need to talk_about it . But that ' s not always true . Who doesn ' t want more pleasure ? Talking_about sex can mean telling a partner what touches bring_on orgasms. &quot; Experience taught Maureen Ward that lesson . For years , she endured boring sex with introverted men who ignored her . But 12 years in psychotherapy taught her that low self-esteem encouraged her to select sexual partners who unconsciously confirmed her feelings of worthlessness . &quot; Now I have a husband I trust , &quot; says Ward , who received sex counseling from Fithian ' s center . &quot; We have no problems talking_about sex . And we have great sex. &quot;</TEXT>
