   <HEADLINE> FIGHTING FOR THE SOUL OF BRAZIL ; IN A COUNTRY PLAGUED BY SCANDAL AND RULED BY THE ELITE , AN HONEST COMMON_MAN THREATENS TO TURN POLITICS INSIDE OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are places you only visit when you ' re running for office or writing_about someone who is . Such a place is Roraima ( pronounced Roe-RYE-mah ) , the Brazilian state known to the outside world , if it is known at all , for being home to the last of the Stone_Age tribes , most famously the Yanomani . Although its capital , Boa Vista , affects an elegant modernity -- wide , untrafficked boulevards shoot like rays from an arch-shaped city_center -- it ' s still a rambunctious gold-boom town filled with bars , brothels and starving children whom the authorities don ' t bother their heads about . Boa Vista is so far off the beaten track that even people who live a_thousand miles up the Amazon think_of this city as the middle of nowhere . On a clear day , you can see Guyana . During the flight in , I ' d been talking_about the city with an affable professor of tropical diseases , who said , &quot; Its name means ' beautiful view. ' &quot; &quot; And is it beautiful ? &quot; He laughed sadly . &quot; If you don ' t look_at the city. &quot; A photographer broke_in , shaking his head . &quot; Roraima is a place for garimpeiros -- prospectors . There are hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of minerals here . Everybody who comes here is digging for something. &quot; He smiled , proud_of his own little joke ; just a_few rows behind us sat Luis Inacio Lula da Silva , known by everyone simply as Lula , the charismatic socialist who ' s favored to become Brazil ' s next president when the two-round elections begin in the fall . Lula was heading to Roraima as part of his nationwide Caravana da Cidadania , or Citizenship Caravan , a euphemistic term for pre-campaign swing ; he was prospecting for votes . And what was I looking_for in following him to a backwater where miners still massacre Indians ? Nothing less than the future of Latin_American politics . Lula ' s rise from a peasant ' s shack to the threshold of the presidential palace is one of the great political stories of our time -- a personal odyssey every bit as brave and historic as those made by Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel . It was coming_up on midnight when we finally saw lights , gaudy as Vegas after the black canopy of rain_forest that had stretched below us for the last hour . The landing_gear touched_down , and before the door swung open , a lovely , eerie singing rose from the night : Lu-la-lahhh . Lu-la-lahhh . It was Lula ' s theme_song , a musical_phrase as famous in Brazil as any bossa nova . The second-floor observation deck was filled with hundreds of Lula supporters , nearly all_of them under 25 , singing and laughing , draped over the parapet , waving every kind of banner and sign . Four-letter placards exclaiming &quot; Lula ! &quot; Red-and-white banners bearing the initials PT , for Partido dos Trabalhadores , the Workers ' Party . And , of course , signs reading &quot; Feliz 1994 &quot; -- happy , because 1994 is the year they will get_to elect Lula . When Lula emerged from the plane , he raised his fist and the crowd roared -- they smelled a winner . As the PT vans drove us to the hotel , the kids hot-rodded alongside , honking and waving banners and shrieking into the night . The air was thick_with the scent of burning rubber , soon to be replaced by the scent of gunpowder as people set_off one Roman_candle after another , tinting the treetops pink . Lula shook dozens of hands , laughing and calling his admirers campanheiro before finally going inside . The petistas ( as the PT ' s followers are known ) lingered in the driveway , setting_off firecrackers and periodically breaking_into a chant : &quot; Ole , ole , ole , ola , Lu-la , Lu-LAH ! &quot; And in the exhausting heat , which even after midnight wrapped itself around us like a barber ' s towel , I marveled at the passions raised by this short , hairy 48-year-old man whose thick neck , powerful torso and spindly legs give him the physique of a cartoon bull . Squeezed into a cheap tan sport coat that would be fashionable nowhere , he had none of the shimmering charisma of JFK or Gorby . But the crowd didn ' t mind his lack of patrician style . that ' s part of what they loved about him . He is one of them , a son of the peasantry poised to become a new kind of president : a socialist , a democrat and a worker . If he wins , Lula will be South_America ' s first elected president to come from the dispossessed classes . Like the Chiapas uprising or the voting-out of the neo-liberals in Venezuela , Lula ' s ascent challenges the official post-Cold War story line in which everyone is rushing to embrace free-market capitalism . ( &quot; I defend private_property , &quot; he says , &quot; ' but for everybody . We cannot allow one man to own 25 million acres when others are starving. &quot; ) Old-school communism may be dead , but the conditions that fostered it are still thriving , especially in Brazil , a country permanently on the verge of a nervous_breakdown . The prototype of the new_Latin American leftist , Lula shatters all_the cliches about wild-eyed revolutionaries . He ' s not a caudillo . He ' s not a guerrilla with bandoleers crisscrossing his chest . He ' s not even reflexively anti-American . ( He has always opposed Soviet-style communism. ) His party boasts some of Brazil ' s leading congressmen and mayors . It brings_together tens of millions of supporters in a coalition of unionists , peasant farmers , rubber tappers , intellectuals , progressive priests , left-wing millionaires , activists and militants . &quot; The more democracy there is in Brazil , &quot; Lula says , &quot; the better our chances of winning. &quot; that ' s why , the morning after our arrival in Boa Vista , the Citizenship Caravan drove two hours through dusty savannah punctuated by cashew_trees and cracking , gray termite hills that resemble avant-garde sculptures . Our destination was the Maloca do Bismarck , central meeting_place for the Macuxi tribe , whose members have no idea how such a Teutonic name was applied to this collection of open-air huts roofed with leaves from the naja plant . Outside the main hut , scabby-kneed kids ran_around in T-shirts adorned with peculiar misspellings ( &quot; Vacatign Time ! &quot; ) and sneaker logos unknown to the industrialized West . Inside , the village elders reported on the state of the tribe , then turned the rally over to Lula , who rose and talked_about the things he always talks_about -- better health_care and education , the social cost of corruption , the egregiously unfair distribution of wealth , the absolute need for land_reform . But all politics is local politics , and the Macuxi were listening for what he said about Indians . They unleashed their most vigorous nods when Lula said that he would support their right to their lands &quot; without vacillation. &quot; It was a good speech , and Lula held his audience easily , flaunting all_the charisma I ' d missed the previous night . Using no notes , he started softly , his gravelly bass_voice working against his deliberateness , a slight lisp comporting oddly with his coiled physicality . As he went_on , his tempo quickened , and he worked himself up , not hammy but focused , like Brando burrowing into an especially tasty scene . His finger jabbed , his hand made small circles ( you noticed the missing little_finger of his left_hand , lost in a machine press ) and , as a flush brightened his skin , his eyes became the smoldering black coals of a_thousand romance novels -- he ' s not a person you want glaring at you . Lula spoke with the angry , barrelhouse directness of one who cut his teeth addressing the hard men in Sao Paulo union halls . By the end of the speech , he had reached the point I recognized from the television clips , when his impatience for change surrounds him like a white-hot aura . Angry , impatient , direct -- was this the way to win an election in a country that prides itself on tropical good_humor ? I mentioned this to the professor on the airplane , Marcus Barros , who is also president of the Amazonian chapter of the PT . His eyes lost their smile , and he put his hand on my shoulder . &quot; You have to understand . We ' ve been waiting all our lives for this election . Now is the chance to change the history of this country . The same people have been running Brazil for the last 500 years . It finally has to stop. &quot; THE WORLD ' S FIFTH LARGEST COUNTRY IN POPULATION ( 152 MILLION ) AND AREA ( slightly smaller than the United States ) , Brazil has the surreal expansiveness of a country that embraces the Amazon rain_forest and the hardscrabble northeastern sertao , the Girl from Ipanema and the ugly sprawl of Sao Paulo with its umpteen million people . Such a vast , swirling country is impossible to get a handle on -- there are just too many stories . Small wonder that many commentators fall_into the cliche of treating Brazil as the real-life version of its telenovelas , the nighttime soaps watched by everyone from millionaires to slum dwellers in the favelas . Of course , there is something delirious about the place . In Sao Paulo , people were laughing_at the black-comic refinements of the latest corruption scandal . Explaining how he ' d made $ 51 million from an $ 80 # 000-a-year job , Congressman Joao Alves got_on the tube , clasped his hands and insisted he ' d done nothing wrong -- God had helped him win the lottery 24 # 000 times . After a_few days of such hijinks , I began to understand Charles de Gaulle ' s remark : &quot; Brazil is not a serious country. &quot; It all depends_on what you mean by serious . There are 40 million Brazilians in absolute poverty , another 60 million living_in squalor , many of them with jobs . There are millions of homeless children , the abandonados , and they are routinely murdered in the streets of Rio de Janeiro , often by policemen and paramilitary thugs paid by local businessmen . The minimum_wage buys less than it did_in 1940 , and the distribution of income is far worse than India ' s . The inflation_rate -- currently 2 # 751 % a year -- makes simply buying one ' s groceries a brainteaser , and crime has reached the point where the middle-class sequesters itself in bunker-like enclaves , protected by armed sentries , while the poor crowd into some of the world ' s most dangerous slums . Even the legendary beaches are being destroyed . The vast majority of Brazilians live from hand to mouth , without money or power or hope . The seeds of this catastrophe were planted centuries ago : Since the days of Portuguese control , Brazil ' s ruling elite has been notorious for its cruelty and greed . But the current mess has its immediate roots in the 1964 coup d ' etat , when President Joao Goulart , a moderate reformer , was ousted by the military in the name of &quot; order &quot; and anti-communism , with the support of President Lyndon B . Johnson ' s Administration . For the first 15 years of the ditadura , the dictatorship , the Brazilian economy expanded by leaps and bounds , but most of the new wealth went_to the elite and the emerging middle_class . Brazil was becoming what they call &quot; Belindia &quot; : a prosperous population the size of Belgium ' s surrounded by masses living_in the misery one associates with India . In 1972 , President General Emilio Garrastazu Medici described the situation memorably : &quot; The economy is going well , the people not so well. &quot; Although many brave souls stood_up to the dictatorship , the military cracked_down brutally ; even today , everyone you meet knows someone who was bullied , jailed , tortured or driven into exile . As happened in the communist bloc , the Brazilian generals lost their grip when the economy began collapsing , and people began publicly challenging their authority . Perhaps the boldest of these challenges came_in the late 1970s , from the Sao Paulo auto workers , whose union was led by the fiery young Lula . Under duress , the generals announced the abertura , a gradual political opening , and in 1989 , Brazil had its first direct presidential elections in a quarter of a century . But in the absence of a sturdy democratic tradition , the 1989 campaign had a frantic , almost demented quality . Months into the campaign , the country was shaken by the entry of a new candidate , Silvio Santos , a TV variety-show host whose sweaty hucksterism made one yearn for the self-effacing sincerity of Jerry Lewis in mid-telethon . Santos promptly shot to the top of the polls and might well have won , had the courts not ruled that he ' d filed improperly for the race . &quot; After the dictatorship , we did not know how to have a politics , &quot; explains Andri Petry , a senior political editor at Veja , the Brazilian equivalent of Time magazine . &quot; There were too many parties . Sometimes one man was a party . The people did not know how to understand a campaign , and the press did not know how to report it . That is how Collor won. &quot; Petry is referring to Fernando Collor de Mello , the little-known governor of Alagoas who narrowly defeated Lula for the presidency . Collor ' s campaign cast him as a young , handsome outsider who wanted to go_to Brasilia to fire overpaid bureaucrats ( &quot; maharajahs &quot; ) and clean_up corruption ; a famous photo showed him with his pockets pulled_out , demonstrating their honest emptiness . In fact , the crazy-eyed governor was a multimillionaire scion of the ruling_class ( his father once shot a man to death on the Senate floor but was never charged ) and ran_for president as the Menendez boys might buy a car . After taking_office , Collor spent a year dazzling everyone with his vigor ; he did karate , drove racing_cars , jogged in T-shirts emblazoned with catch phrases about the Amazon . President George_Bush compared him to Indiana Jones -- an embarrassing move , as it turned_out . Enraged by a family squabble , Fernando ' s own brother Pedro went_to the press and announced that President Collor had been peddling influence to the tune of tens of millions of dollars . Collor was impeached in 1992 but , true_to the traditions of Brazilian justice , has never been charged with any crime . Collor ' s dishonesty left the public shocked . The cynicism kicked_in last October when it was revealed that nearly 20 members of the congressional budget committee had used their positions to make themselves rich . They stole $ 200 million of federal money earmarked for charities . They pocketed millions in kickbacks from construction projects . They siphoned_off millions meant for health_care and education -- this in a land where most adults have only a grade-school education , and schoolteachers make barely $ 100 a month . These high-octane scandals , plus scores of routine ones , have shaken public faith in politicians ; a_few idiots have begun making pleas for the good old days of the dictatorship . But according to Veja ' s Petry , such scandals have a positive side : &quot; It is good for us to get_over our illusions . Before , we thought it was only the generals who were the problem . Then we thought it was only Collor . Now we see that the corruption is all through the elite . We see the connections between the business elite and the political elite that we did not know before . We are no longer naive , and this is a good thing. &quot; It ' s certainly good for the PT , which has been at the forefront of investigating the congressional scandal -- none of its 37 members were accused . It has been even better for Lula himself . Before the scandal broke , he had been assailed for claiming that the Congress was filled with picaretas , chiselers . Now , Lula ' s claims as a truth teller are stronger than ever and his personal honesty even more of an asset . He ' s a worker who ' s never moved_in the circles where big deals are cut and million-dollar bribes exchange hands . The PT pays him a salary of $ 24 # 000 a year ; he lives_in Sao Bernardo do Corpo , an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo . &quot; Lula ' s a known quantity , &quot; says Petry . &quot; He ' s been famous since the late ' 70s , and everybody knows he hasn ' t become rich . Even people who hate him know he is not a thief. &quot; &quot; HERE ' S A CLASSIC STORY FOR YOU. &quot; THE SPEAKER IS ADRIAN COOPER , AN expatriate documentary filmmaker who ' s been filming Lula on and off since the late 1970s . &quot; A couple of months ago , I was flying back from Belo Horizonte ( Brazil ' s fourth-largest city ) , and I ran_into Lula in the airport . He was all alone in a coffee-stained white suit , carrying his battered old_bag , waiting for his flight home on Tam , a domestic airline with mostly prop planes . We went_for a drink_in the bar , and I remember thinking how amazing it was that this guy was probably going_to be the president of Brazil next year , and here he was flying in his stained suit in an economy seat on a second-rate airline . It ' s so extraordinary , the difference that separates him from a man like Paulo Maluf ( the mayor of Sao Paulo ) , who would always take a Lear jet or fly first-class -- he ' d never rub shoulders with the masses . But then , that ' s Lula. &quot; It ' s certainly the Lula of the public image , a man invariably described by his supporters as um brasileiro tipico , an ordinary Brazilian man . Of course , such a characterization is more_than a little disingenuous : How many perfectly ordinary men have the talent and drive to approach the presidency of the world ' s fifth biggest country ? Still , it ' s true that , like a much greater Jesse Jackson -- greater because he is less vain and more accomplished -- Lula is as much a metaphor as a man . He ' s lived a life that encapsulates the mythic trajectory of his whole country . To understand his rise is to understand Brazil . Luis Inacio da Silva was born in 1945 in the farming town of Garanhuns , in the perpetually poor northeastern state of Pernambuco ; the youngest of nine children , he was given the nickname Lula ( which was later officially added_to his name for electoral purposes ) . Shortly after his birth , his father , Aristide , moved to the southern city of Santos , where jobs were more plentiful . When Lula was 7 , Aristide returned to Pernambuco , put his family on the back of a truck and took them down south , a 13-day journey of 1 # 800 miles . In making this journey from the rural north to the urban south -- the great symbolic journey of modern Brazil -- Lula joined in a migration made by 30 million of his compatriots since the end of World_War_II . The family lived_in a shantytown where Lula sold peanuts on the street and dreamed , like all Brazilian boys , of becoming a soccer star ; at 11 , he quit school to work in a laundry . When he was 13 , he landed a job in a factory that made nuts_and_bolts , working a machine press from 7 in the morning to 7 at night . It may sound dreadful , but for a boy of Lula ' s background , this entry into the labor elite was an achievement comparable_to a Kentucky coal_miner ' s son getting a degree from Harvard . At the time of the 1964 coup , Lula was working for Industrias Villares , a heavy-goods producer in Sao Bernardo do Campo . And despite the heated protestations of his brother Jose , a militant Communist , he was vehemently anti-union . Lula didn ' t so_much as enter the union hall until 1967 . Once he did go inside , however , he quickly became one of the union ' s leaders . By 1972 , the year he married his current wife , Marisa Leticia ( his first wife died of hepatitis ) , he was elected to the governing board of the Sao Bernardo Metalworkers Union . Within three years , he ' d been elected union president , winning more_than 90 % of the votes from its 140 # 000 members . At 30 , Lula already led the largest union in South_America . Despite his position , he remained largely apolitical -- &quot; a common union leader , &quot; he now says . All this changed when , in 1975 , the military arrested his brother for being a &quot; subversive. &quot; Rather than backing_off , Lula was galvanized . By 1978 , he was leading the Metalworkers Union in a labor action against the Scania truck company , the first full-fledged Brazilian strike in 10 years . Scania was forced to negotiate a pay raise for the workers , who at the time were making 60 cents an hour ( compared to $ 8.65 in the United States ) . This success led to a series of more ambitious strikes that became a test of the government ' s authority . Lula become a household name , famous for his skill at rallying his troops , less known for softening their militant stridency . Cooper remembers &quot; going_to a football_stadium filled with 80 # 000 metalworkers , all_of whom desperately wanted to keep_on with the action . Lula got_up before them and explained why they shouldn ' t -- how it would be pushing beyond their strength and lead to disaster . Nobody in the stadium wanted to hear that -- they all wanted to keep striking -- but he eventually persuaded them with the clarity of his logic and the passion of his speech . By the end , the whole stadium was chanting ' Lu-lah , Lu-lah , Lu-lah. ' I ' ve never seen anything like it. &quot; Unwilling to negotiate with Lula , the government sentenced him to 3 1 / 2 years in prison on trumped-up &quot; national security &quot; charges . But the political winds had changed , and Lula ' s conviction was overturned on appeal . Back in the streets , he was free to take his next step -- the creation of a workers party , the PT . &quot; I realized it was necessary in 1978 , &quot; Lula says , &quot; when I went_to Congress to talk to the representatives . And I learned that of 480 representatives , only two were from trade_unions . I asked myself , ' How can the Congress approve laws for the workers if all_the representatives there represent the businessmen ? ' So we decided to create our own political organization. &quot; He snorts a laugh . &quot; If I ' d known that doing_it would be so difficult , I possibly never would have tried. &quot; It is always difficult to know exactly when something new has entered the world , but the creation of the Workers ' Party on Feb . 10 , 1980 , may have been one of those moments . &quot; The PT established itself as the first political_party in the country ' s history that was not formed at the behest of the elite. &quot; So say Ken Silverstein and Emir Sader in &quot; Without Fear of Being Happy , &quot; the best book in English on Lula and the PT . Their words are echoed by professor Jorge G . Castaneda , whose &quot; Utopia Unarmed : The Latin_American Left After the Cold_War &quot; sees the PT in an even larger context . &quot; Lula ' s PT is a harbinger , &quot; he tells me from his office in Mexico_City . &quot; It may well be the new_Latin American populism -- in the good_sense of the term. &quot; It took the PT years to expand its influence . In 1982 , Lula ran_for the governership of Sao Paulo state with the slogan &quot; A Brazilian Like You &quot; -- a phrase designed to attack the traditional authority of the elites . But at this point , the ordinary Brazilian was still so filled with a sense of inferiority that the slogan backfired : It was taken_to mean , &quot; A loser like you. &quot; Paunchy , kinky-haired and ungrammatical , Lula lacked the sable elegance that the masses associated with a real governor . Despite such setbacks , the party continued to water the grass roots , winning important mayorships and enlisting the fervent support of top agrarian reformers , prominent Roman_Catholic priests ( including the famous liberation theologian Leonardo Boff ) and rain-forest activists such_as the late Chico Mendes . By the presidential election of 1989 , the PT was ready to explode . After months of campaigning , the election came_down to two men : the underdog , Lula , and the overwhelming favorite , Collor . It was a campaign to make the Clinton-Bush contest seem dignified . Although Collor , as a governor , had ended taxes on sugar companies that then backed his candidacy to the tune of $ 12 million , the campaign centered_on increasingly shrill charges against the PT ' s candidate . Lula , it was claimed , owned a JVC stereo ; this proved he wasn ' t really a worker . Lula , it was claimed , would force middle-class families to give rooms in their homes to PT workers . Lula , it was claimed , was anti-democratic -- this despite his leading role in the democracy movement and Collor ' s own voluminous silence during the dictatorship . Still , Lula whittled_away at his opponent ' s lead , promising land_reform and a higher minimum_wage and calling_down wrath on the corrupt elite . The race was a dead_heat when Collor pulled a stunt that could have come from a telenovela . Days before the election , he arranged for Lula ' s ex-mistress , Miriam Cordeiro , to hold a press_conference and accuse Lula of offering her money to abort the fetus that was to become their daughter Lurian ( he has four children with his wife ) . All the evidence rebuts these charges -- Lula acknowledges paternity , Lurian ' s a PT activist , Cordeiro suddenly came_into a lot of money -- but the attack threw Lula into a funk . He performed feebly in the last presidential debate , and specially edited lowlights of his performance were replayed over and over by TV Globo , the pro-Collor network watched by 70 % of the population . In the end , Collor won , 35 million votes to 31 million -- a triumph soon to be sullied by the man who enjoyed it . Yet even as the election showed that the PT had not fully arrived , it established Lula , only 44 years old , as the national alternative to the traditional political elite . The past 4 1 / 2 years have diminished neither his stature nor his savvy at wooing the middle_class : His grammar is better , his beard more neatly trimmed , his suits more likely to be Italian . In recent polls that have him running against every possible candidate at once , Lula invariably receives 30 % to 32 % of the vote , more_than twice the nearest opponent . He is , if anything , more popular than ever , both personally and as the embodiment of his party . &quot; He ' s an ordinary Brazilian guy , and that ' s his appeal , &quot; said Ricardo Kotscho , a shrewd , witty ex-journalist whose official title of press secretary masks a more profound role as Lula ' s buddy , confidant and jester . &quot; Usually your Brazilian politicians are from the elite , the political elite or the cultural elite . Lula ' s the first one who comes from the people , and he already has much more_than he ever dreamed of . So now he feels responsibility to do something about the injustice in Brazil . It ' s not that he ' s a saint . He ' s not . He ' s a man , um brasileiro tipico . If Lula was free to do whatever he wanted , it would be fishing , soccer , women and parties . And that ' s why people like him. &quot; OF COURSE , NOT EVERYONE LIKES LULA , OR HE would n ' t HAVE LOST THE 1989 election . Late one smoggy afternoon , I stopped by Sao Paulo ' s City_Hall to talk to the mayor , Paulo Maluf , who has twice run_for president as the candidate of the Social Democratic Party , which was created by the dictatorship . Maluf is a dapper , funny man whose penchant for deliberate , cheerful buffoonishness -- his hoarse voice and full cheeks recall a_thousand sendups of Don Vito Corleone -- can ' t hide his enormous shrewdness . Although coy about whether he would again seek the presidency , he was straightforward when it came_to Lula and the PT . He couldn ' t imagine why anyone would vote for them . &quot; Lula ' s probably good at many things , but for being president &quot; -- he wrinkled his brow ironically -- &quot; he has no more experience than the average people . He never worked in business , private or public . He never was a director of a free_enterprise or public enterprise . He never was a mayor . He never was_on a city_council . He never was a secretary_of_transportation or anything else . He never was a minister. &quot; Maluf rubbed his thumb along a desk the length of a shuffleboard court and gazed happily around his huge office with its scale-model version of a new public-works project . The problem , he said , isn ' t merely Lula himself : It ' s the limitations of his ideology . &quot; The ideas of the left are old-fashioned . Don ' t pay the public_debt , don ' t pay the national_debt , complete control of the banks -- this was a speech that was good 50 years ago . that ' s the reason they ' re not going_to win the election . The PT was the government for four years in the city of Sao Paulo , and they lost the next election because of mismanagement. &quot; This view of Lula is shared by the elite and much of the middle_class . Some of their disdain is mere snobbery toward any man with a working-class style and little formal education . But their main objection is economic . The PT wants to limit the size of landholdings , stop privatization of state industries , maintain trade_barriers and find ways to redistribute wealth . These economic proposals will cost his opponents money and diminish their power . They also run counter to the neo-liberal orthodoxies of the West . There ' s considerable off-the-record nervousness about what a leftist government in Brasilia might do to the spread of free-market policies in South_America . At the same time , most international financiers and U.S. State_Department experts think that it ' s too early to be sure how radically Lula would actually govern . As one Latin_American financial expert told me , &quot; Reform governments have a way of coming_back toward the middle. &quot; Brazil ' s economic elite isn ' t nearly so sanguine . The daily papers are filled with business_leaders arguing that a Lula presidency will lead to stagnation , the ruination of trade , the end of luxury imports , capital fleeing the country . To reassure them , Lula has had 54 meetings with businessmen ' s groups to let them see firsthand that he ' s not o bicho-papao , the bogyman . In Boa Vista , I sat in on one such session with the Commercial Association of Roraima ( located over a bridal shop ) and was startled at how well he eventually got_along_with these small-city entrepreneurs , who clearly couldn ' t stand his economic plan . &quot; I liked him , &quot; a store-owner said afterward . &quot; I ' m against him , but I liked him. &quot; This seems to be the general attitude , whether in Roraima or Sao Paulo . The businessmen he meets plan to oppose him tooth and claw , but they respect his personal honesty and willingness to negotiate : They think he ' s a man you can do business with . What scares them is that Lula , who stands at both the figurative and ideological center of the PT , often cannot control his party ' s radical left wing , whose dogmatic zeal has gotten them dubbed &quot; Shiites. &quot; It ' s this group that leads many middle-class Brazilians to fear that Lula ' s election will destroy the country ' s cruel but functioning balance , unloosing an even crueler chaos onto the land . Although the presidential campaign won ' t hit its stride for several more months , Lula and the PT are expecting nonstop attacks between now and October , especially because the political right is floundering . All its potential candidates of national stature have been discredited ; the right can ' t even field a dazzling unknown because Collor discredited that kind of dark_horse . Their opponents ' current disarray hasn ' t lulled the PT into a false sense of confidence . Its leaders know that anything is possible in Brazilian politics and that it would not be easy to defeat another left-of-center candidate , such_as Finance_Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso . Whoever Lula ' s opponent , he will be backed by the most powerful men in Brazil . Baronial landowners who buy the votes of their peasant workers with shoes or food . Right-wing politicians such_as Bahia ' s Gov . Antonio Carlos Magalhaes , who are expert at manipulating the government bureaucracy . Corporate magnates like Roberto Marinho , owner of the Globo media empire , whose support of Collor is widely believed to have swung the last election . Every politician in the world gripes about the media , but in Lula ' s case the complaints are often justified . Headlines accuse Lula of crimes that the stories beneath them do not mention , much less justify . News_programs trumpet every charge against him , even unsubstantiated smears by his political enemies . Last November , a small-time union boss named Oswaldo Cruz Jr . accused the PT of taking illegal campaign contributions from the Central Workers Union ; over the next weeks , the papers never stopped implying that Lula was just as corrupt as any other politician . The story eventually petered out . Then in early January , Oswaldo was murdered . For the next week , the media were filled with insinuations that Lula had ordered him assassinated . TV Globo ' s nightly news_show devoted seven or eight minutes each night to the crime and its possible links to Lula . Wishful thinking , as it turned_out : The confessed murderer had killed Oswaldo in the course of a personal argument . Lula has no illusion that he can win_over the media , and it ' s unlikely that he would want to even if he could : He has a bracing blue-collar contempt for politicians who tart_up their images for television . Yet virtues have a way of becoming vices , and Lula ' s hostility to image making might hurt his electoral chances in a country that gets its news from TV . Nothing captures the ambiguities of his relationship to the image-making process better than a brief exchange that occurred at Roraima ' s Lake Caracarana , where the Citizenship Caravan stopped for a_few minutes after meeting the Macuxi tribe . Relaxed for the first time that day , Lula rolled_up his blue_jeans and walked into the lake . Roberto , the photographer from Veja , was snapping away , happy to catch Lula in his red T-shirt against a picturesque background -- the big-city socialist grooving on nature . Noticing a woman doing her wash in the water , he suggested that Lula go_over and help her . Lula shook his head . &quot; Go_on , &quot; said Roberto . &quot; It will make a great shot. &quot; &quot; No , &quot; Lula said . &quot; I don ' t want to bother her . I don ' t want to turn everybody I meet into part of my campaign. &quot; Back in the van , Roberto couldn ' t stop talking_about the strangeness of a politician who would pass_up a photo op . &quot; As a man , I respect him for not wanting to bother the woman . He ' s a good_guy . I voted for him . But as a photographer &quot; -- he shook his head sadly -- &quot; he just doesn ' t know how to give you any good pictures. &quot; IN THE 30 YEARS SINCE THEODORE WHITE AND NORMAN MAILER TRANSFORMED how journalists write_about politicians , it ' s become impossible to cover any presidential hopeful without asking , &quot; What ' s driving this man to seek the big prize ? What gives him the fire in his belly ? &quot; Unable to get these answers while talking to him on the fly , I waited around Sao Paulo for days , hoping for the in-depth personal interview that would show me the real Lula . I finally got my audience with the candidate in his airy office atop a small office_building off the Rua Pousa Alegre . From the moment he stood to greet me , his body tight as a cramped muscle , I knew he was in a black mood . He ' d been fighting with a Sao Paulo newspaper and obviously didn ' t care what somebody would write_about him in Los Angeles . When I began by saying I wanted to ask about the past , he glowered at his press secretary . He ' d answered these questions a_thousand times before . I persevered , but his eyes took_on the half-vacant look I recognized from American politicians -- he was talking by rote . He listened to my questions as if they contained fishhooks . Lula may be an unconventional politician , but he ' s still a politician , and he used my questions to score his own points -- parrying perceived criticisms , attacking the media , insisting that the campaign was completely under_control . His impatience filled the room , and I suddenly got the slightest whiff of something I ' ve seen in Jesse Jackson : a sense of entitlement , as though the world owes him the presidency because he ' s come so_much further than the other candidates and cares so_much more deeply than they do . In that moment , I felt sure I understood what was driving Lula to seek office : the rage of a man who was raised hungry , faced the humiliations of powerlessness , battled for everything he ' d gotten and now feels that he spends his life being slandered by the very men who grew rich from the fruits of his labor . Yet even as I was struck by his ill_temper , I knew better than to think it was the whole story . It ' s one of the small-minded habits of our time that we are always looking_for unsavory private motives to explain compassionate political behavior , as if a consuming desire for justice or passionate solidarity with the poor couldn ' t possibly be enough to make anybody do anything except write a small , tax-exempt check . To say that Lula is driven simply by anger is to diminish the man by mistaking moral indignation for personal resentment ; if anger is his goad , it is not his goal . I remembered how , during the Roraima caravan , he ' d been mauled by his public : strangers wanting a handshake , reporters asking about allegations from his political enemies , PT workers vying for his gaze , seeking the benediction of one whose potential power makes him a source of good_luck . I could see in his eyes that he wanted to flee -- he was beat -- but he kept right on with his task . His situation reminded me of something I ' d heard about the Amazon . It seems that when you need to lead cattle across a river where there may be piranha , you always throw_in one ox first so that the fish will attack it and the others can cross safely . The term for this first ox is boi da piranha , and in an odd way , that ' s how Lula struck me on that trip to Roraima : a man who was letting himself be devoured to help his comrades get_across . Of course , there are those who say that the piranha won ' t really start biting until Lula wins the Oct . 3 election . that ' s when he will learn what Solidarity learned in Poland and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua : Nothing can destroy you more exquisitely than the expectations you create . In fact , a small version of this has already happened to the PT : When Luiza Erundina was elected mayor of Sao Paulo in 1988 , her achievement fell so far below the dreams she had excited that the PT ' s next candidate for mayor was defeated . &quot; Luiza Erundina did not satisfy the expectations that were created , &quot; says &quot; Utopia Unarmed ' s &quot; Castaneda . &quot; She didn ' t make a revolution . All she was , in a sense , was a good , honest , decent , somewhat progressive mayor . That doesn ' t sound like much . On the other hand , having honest , decent , somewhat progressive mayors in countries like ours is not something we ' re used to . &quot; And the same will probably be true if Lula is president . The expectations will be too high . The best that can be hoped is that he be honest , decent and somewhat progressive in the face of so many problems that no one president could solve them . That would be enough. &quot; But his defeat would be a crushing disappointment for the Latin_American left and , in particular , his followers in Brazil . It would n ' t be enough for them that Lula had proven to be their Jesse Jackson , the underclass hero who gives the best speeches but never wins the top prize . One Saturday , I had lunch with Luis Tenorio de Oliveira Lima , a prominent Sao Paulo psychoanalyst , and asked him if he could explain Lula ' s place in the national psyche . He smiled , perhaps at my curious American way of putting the question . &quot; I would answer this way . There have always been two Brazils -- a Brazil where people have many things , and a Brazil where people have nothing . For a long_time , these two Brazils looked_at one another through a pane_of_glass . They did not really touch , but they saw each other , and they could communicate . Over the last 30 years or so , the country has grown more fragmented , and the glass has grown much darker . When the haves and have-nots look_at each other now , they see only their own reflections and their own dark fantasies of the other . They can no longer communicate but only know fear and hatred . The country functions , but it is . . . &quot; &quot; Psychotic ? &quot; He nodded : &quot; Lula is the one man who can stand where the glass has always been and communicate with both sides . He can talk to both the poor and the powerful as their equal . He is the only politician since the 1920s with the potential to start the two Brazils talking again. &quot; &quot; And do you think he ' ll be able to do_it ? &quot; &quot; I ' m too old to have hope in anything. &quot; He cocked his head . &quot; Of course , that doesn ' t mean I would n ' t vote for him. &quot;</TEXT>
