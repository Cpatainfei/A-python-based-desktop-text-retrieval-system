   <TEXT> * We are writing in response to &quot; L.A. County Record Worst in HIV Detection Program &quot; ( May 10 ) and your editorial &quot; Sizing Up the True AIDS Problem &quot; ( May 11 ) . In his critique of the Los Angeles County HIV testing and counseling program it is not clear why your reporter did not include 1993 data ( available from this office. ) Had he done so , he would have found that in 1993 there was a significant expansion of the confidential HIV testing and counseling program in Los Angeles County . The number of testing sites increased from 67 in the first_quarter of 1992 to 130 sites by the fourth quarter of 1993 . HIV tests at these sites increased 71 % , from 25 # 577 in 1992 to 43 # 804 in 1993 . Testing in Los Angeles actually exceeded all other cities in 1993 , including New York City , which performed 43 # 532 tests . Furthermore , the number of HIV-infected persons identified in Los Angeles versus the number of persons tested increased from 1.3 % to 1.8 % ( 796 HIV-infected persons were identified in 1993 compared to 345 in 1992 ) . Your comparison of &quot; hit rates &quot; in the seven targeted cities ignores important epidemiologic information . The HIV-infection rates in the general population in Los Angeles and in our highest risk groups , i.e. , homosexual men and injection drug_users , are lower than in the other seven cities . For example , we estimate that approximately 0.5 % , or 1 in 200 persons , in the general population of Los Angeles are HIV infected , while homosexual men treated in L.A. County STD clinics have HIV-infection rates of approximately 35 % . In comparison , the estimated HIV infection rate in the general population of San Francisco is 4 % , or 1 in 25 persons , while homosexual men treated in San Francisco STD clinics have infection rates of 50 % . In addition , the infection rate among injection drug_users in Los Angeles is under 10 % compared to rates between 50 % and 60 % in New York City . Given this lower background rate of HIV infection in Los Angeles , it is not surprising that we will have to test more people , even in our highest risk groups , to identify the same number of HIV-infected persons . Finally , your comparison of confidential HIV testing with anonymous testing is inappropriate because it confuses two distinct populations . Anonymous test sites provide service to a group of highly motivated , HIV &quot; informed &quot; persons who have made a conscious decision to seek testing . In contrast , the county ' s confidential testing program targets persons who are less knowledgeable_about HIV , are unaware that they may be at risk of HIV infection , and are not likely to seek testing . As the HIV epidemic shifts increasingly into low-income and minority populations , reaching those who are infected will be more labor intensive and , upon superficial analysis will appear to be less &quot; cost-effective. &quot; However , it is imperative that we continue to refine and expand our efforts to reach these populations to allow early identification and referral to treatment as well as_to provide education to prevent new infections . Confidential HIV testing targeted to high-risk individuals who are not likely to utilize anonymous testing services is an essential component of this activity . PAUL SIMON MD , M.P.H.
