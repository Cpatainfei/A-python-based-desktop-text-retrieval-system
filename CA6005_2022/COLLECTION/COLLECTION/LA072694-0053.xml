   <HEADLINE> JORDAN DEAL COULD GO_A_LONG_WAY ; CAN ASSAD HANG_OUT THERE ALL ALONE FOREVER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was an occasion that called_for eloquence and vision , and the key participants did not disappoint . President Clinton , King Hussein of Jordan and Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel all spoke words fitting to the solemnity , goodwill and promise of the moment . The two Middle Eastern leaders did not sign a treaty of peace when they met on Monday in bright sunshine on the White_House lawn , as the leaders of Egypt and Israel had_on a March day 15 years ago ; that is yet to come . But with their agreement on a declaration ending a state of belligerency nearly half a century old , Jordan and Israel have taken a defining turn_in the road . For both , this is an act of national self-interest , an opportunity finally and after great cost to establish normal and mutually_beneficial ties across their long border . Especially for the king , it was also an act of personal courage . He needs no reminding of the fates met by his grandfather , King Abdullah , who was assassinated in 1951 in part because of his readiness to reach a realistic accommodation with Israel ; or of Egypt ' s Anwar Sadat , the first and so far only other Arab leader to make_peace with Israel , who was similarly murdered by opponents of conciliation . War is universally destructive . In the Arab world , tragically , peace can be the undoing of leaders . Hussein is , of course , looking_for rewards beyond what closer ties with Israel can bring , beginning in Washington . Congress , which both Hussein and Rabin are to address today , has not forgotten and has yet to fully forgive the king ' s decision to give tacit backing to Iraq ' s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 . That self-wounding act cost Jordan most of its U.S. military and economic help , along with its considerable annual subsidy from Saudi_Arabia . Hussein desperately needs at least significant forgiveness of Jordan ' s $ 700-million debt to the United States , as well as help in modernizing his armed forces . We urge Congress to be sympathetic to these requests . In the politically reshaped Middle_East now emerging , a Jordan economically stronger and better able to defend itself against radical foes is clearly something U.S. policy should support . With an Israel-Jordan peace approaching , with an Israel-Palestinian settlement lurching ahead , with Israel ' s ties with Tunisia , Morocco and some of the Persian_Gulf states openly expanding , Syria ' s position as odd man surely becomes increasingly uncomfortable . How long might it be before President Hafez Assad stands where Hussein stood Monday ? Maybe never . But maybe , too , sooner than many could right now imagine .</TEXT>
