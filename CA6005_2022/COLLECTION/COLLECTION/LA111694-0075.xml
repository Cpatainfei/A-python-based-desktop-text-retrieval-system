   <HEADLINE> THE JUDICIARY ; CLINTON ' S BIG BENCH : JUDGES OF ALL STRIPES AND COLORS APPOINTED ; BLACKS , LATINOS , WOMEN , EVEN REPUBLICANS FILL FEDERAL VACANCIES . IT IS THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP NAMED BY ANY PRESIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They are a Baltimore prosecutor whose husband was appointed to the federal bench by Ronald Reagan , a renowned civil_rights lawyer here who is legally blind , a veteran prosecutor who became the highest ranking African American in the Los Angeles district_attorney ' s office , a Latino activist in Chicago who worked as a U.S. attorney and a Vermont Republican who was first chosen for the bench by George_Bush . The five are among 129 new judges that President Clinton has appointed to the federal_courts during his first two years . The Clinton judges make_up the most diverse group of presidential appointments ever . Women and minorities account_for 58 % of the total . African Americans are nearly one-fourth . Nine percent are Latino . But the range of backgrounds does not stop there . A few are Republicans . One is outspoken against abortion . Most have practical experience as prosecutors , state judges or corporate attorneys -- or in some instances , all_of the above . And best of all , say academic experts who track the judiciary , the Clinton_Administration has not sacrificed quality for diversity . &quot; These are highly qualified appointees , better on average than those of Reagan , Bush or ( Jimmy ) Carter , &quot; said Sheldon Goldman , a University of Massachusetts political_scientist who monitors selection of judges . He cites as evidence the American Bar Assn. ' s evaluation of judicial nominees . A committee of ABA lawyers investigates all court nominees , analyzes the breadth of their legal experience and interviews dozens of people who know the candidate . At the end , each nominee is rated well-qualified , qualified or not-qualified . In the latest tally , 65 % of Clinton ' s appointees have earned a well-qualified rating , compared with 59 % for Bush , 55 % for Reagan and 56 % for Carter . Last year , the Clinton team got bad marks even from liberal groups for its slow pace in filling the record number of vacancies in the three-tiered federal_court system . Only a Supreme Court vacancy got the President ' s quick attention . But in its second year , the Administration picked_up speed and is now winning rave reviews from the Alliance of Justice , a coalition of liberal groups that monitors the judiciary . Last month , director Nan Aron praised Clinton &quot; for fulfilling his campaign promise to appoint only men and women of unquestioned intellect , judicial temperament , broad experience and a demonstrated concern for the individual rights protected by our Constitution. &quot; Not surprisingly , her conservative counterpart , Tom Jipping at the Free Congress Foundation , is not so enamored of the new judges . &quot; I think there are many liberal judicial activists in that group , and they have been rubber-stamped by the Senate , &quot; Jipping said . So far , however , only two Clinton court nominees have been tagged as liberal ideologues and challenged by Senate Republicans : Rosemary Barkett of Florida and H . Lee Sarokin of New Jersey . Both eventually won confirmation . While Clinton has succeeded now in filling most of the judicial vacancies , he has by no means reshaped the federal judiciary . His appointees fill only 15 % of the 837 federal judgeships , and many of them replaced retiring Democrats from the Carter era . Republican appointees still hold a majority in all 12 federal circuit courts of appeal . In the huge U.S. 9th Circuit Court , which covers California and eight other Western states , Clinton has added only one judge among 26 : Michael Hawkins of Arizona , a former U.S. attorney . But if the Clinton nominees have not reshaped the law , they have surely begun to change the appearance of the judiciary . &quot; At our new judges conference ( in Denver ) , it was wonderful to look_around the room and see a group that looked so like the country , &quot; said U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins of Los Angeles . For 16 years , she worked in the district_attorney ' s office in Los Angeles in jobs that ranged from conducting preliminary hearings and prosecuting consumer fraud cases to serving as a top administrator in the downtown office . In May , she took her seat as a U.S. district judge , the fourth African American to hold a federal judgeship in Los Angeles . She was joined by Judge Richard Paez , a former municipal judge and the first Mexican American to serve on the federal_district court in Los Angeles . In Chicago , Ruben Castillo has been an assistant U.S. attorney , a litigator for a prominent law_firm and the regional director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund . Now , at age 40 , he is the first Latino on the federal bench in Illinois . But he credits his appointment to his broad legal experience , not just his family heritage . In Washington , David S . Tatel has won admirers over the years for his work as a civil_rights lawyer and advocate for poor children . From 1977 to 1979 , he directed the civil_rights office in the Department of Health , Education and Welfare . Said former Education_Secretary Shirley Hufstedler , now a prominent Los Angeles lawyer : &quot; I would be hard-pressed to find another advocate who had done more for the education of minority children than David. &quot; But many who know Tatel only by reputation do not realize he has been blind for more_than 20 years , having lost his sight to retinitis pigmentosa , a genetic_disease . He climbs mountains , skis in Colorado and has completed marathons in New York and Washington . Although no mention was made of his impairment in the White_House announcement , Clinton made Tatel the first blind_person to be a federal appellate judge when he named him to the influential U.S. court of appeals for the District_of_Columbia . In 1990 , Fred Parker was a prominent Republican lawyer and former state deputy attorney_general in Vermont when Bush made him a federal_district judge . On the bench , he won high marks for competence and fairness . And this year , when Clinton had a Vermont seat to fill on the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York , he chose the person who came most highly recommended : Fred Parker . The new judge plans to keep his chambers in Burlington , but now he will begin commuting a_few days a month to Manhattan to hear arguments . Diana Gribbon Motz of Baltimore and her husband are believed to be the first married_couple to sit on the federal bench . &quot; Yes , it ' s true : He ' s a Republican , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s his only flaw. &quot; Reagan put John F . Motz on the federal bench in 1985 , but his wife had also won high marks during her 25-year career as a private litigator , state prosecutor and state appeals court judge . In perhaps her most celebrated case as a Maryland assistant attorney_general , she won a $ 268 # 000 judgment against former Vice_President Spiro T . Agnew to recover money he took as bribes during his term as the state ' s governor . Late last year , she said , she received a call from then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum to talk_about the vacant seat on the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals . &quot; I said , ' Bernie , you must have the wrong Motz , &quot; she recalled . &quot; ' My husband is the best-qualified person to move_up to the 4th Circuit. ' He laughed and said , ' We know your husband , and he has a fine record , but George_Bush should have elevated him. ' &quot; Now , Judge Diana Gribbon Motz sits on the appeals court based in Richmond , Va. , with the power to review rulings of federal_district judges in Maryland , Virginia , West_Virginia , North Carolina and South Carolina . The President ' s Picks President Clinton ' s appointments to the federal bench have been the most diverse group in history .
