   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA , EUROPE SIGN KEY TRADE PACT ; COMMERCE : THE AGREEMENT LIFTS MOST EUROPEAN BARRIERS TO RUSSIAN EXPORTS AND SETS TALKS ON A FREE-TRADE ZONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and European Union leaders on Friday clinched a trade agreement so overarching that Yeltsin proclaimed it a historic step toward uniting Europe . The agreement , signed_on the Greek island of Corfu and acclaimed in Russia as the end of economic isolation from Europe , lifts most European barriers to Russian exports and sets talks beginning in 1998 on a Europe-Russia free-trade zone . &quot; It represents a decisive step toward restoring the unity of our continent , &quot; Yeltsin said of the agreement , and the accord &quot; will bring Russia back into economic Europe as an equal partner. &quot; Coming just two days after Russia joined NATO ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program and coinciding with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin ' s visit to the United States , the pact appeared to signal a new Russian push toward the West -- a shift from Moscow ' s recent efforts to assert its independence in diplomacy . But Alexander Konovalov , a senior analyst at Moscow ' s prestigious USA-Canada Institute , said the timing was a mere coincidence -- and the 10-year agreement with the European Union was simply too good to put_off . &quot; We will have coordinated -- and agreed upon -- market shares for a number of export goods , &quot; Konovalov added . &quot; That is good and normal because what we have been trying to do until now was to break_into Western markets with our dumping prices , for which we have been justifiably pushed_out collectively as some kind of troublemaker . Now , Russia can start seriously thinking_about some cooperation and division of labor with its European partners. &quot; Moscow media estimates that trade_barriers have cost Russia about $ 3 billion a year in lost exports to Europe , its biggest trading partner outside the former Soviet_Union . Yeltsin has often argued , particularly with Washington , that Russia needs free access to Western markets more_than it needs billions of dollars in aid . Under Friday ' s agreement , some barriers to Russian exports will remain on uranium , steel and textiles . But the basic idea is that Russia and the 12 European Union_members exchange most-favored-nation trade status . The agreement is also meant to encourage European injections of money into Russia ' s crisis-ridden economy by making_it easier to get profits out of the country and allowing freer investment . Russia exports mainly raw_materials to Europe , including minerals , metals and wood , and imports largely machinery , processed food and vehicles . Moscow appeared particularly happy that the EU -- unlike the United States -- recognized that the Russian economy is no longer state-run but rather is &quot; in transition &quot; to a market-driven system , meaning that Europe needed less defense against the possible dumping of cheap , state-owned goods . After almost two years of wrangling over the accord , Russia also managed to retain the right to keep_up some import_barriers to protect threatened domestic industries . Its main concessions included an agreement to allow many_more foreign banks to operate in Russia beginning in 1996 and to accept French-backed limitations on its uranium exports . The accord strengthened political ties with a plan for Russian and European leaders to meet twice a year . The Russian and European parliaments must still ratify the agreement . That will be far from automatic given the strong ultranationalist faction in the Russian Duma , where little opposition has been voiced so far . Along with the Russian accord , the EU on Friday finalized its acceptance of four new members -- Austria , Finland , Norway and Sweden -- as of January . Rumblings also continued over who would become the next head of the EU ' s executive_agency , replacing France ' s Jacques Delors . Belgian Prime_Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene has the backing of France and Germany , but there are also candidates from Britain and Holland . The battle for leadership , expected to continue today , threatened to throw a pall on the meeting after the Russian dose of sweetness_and_light . Another sticky moment came when Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi , whose government includes members who call themselves &quot; post-fascists , &quot; was roundly snubbed by one of his Greek hosts at the door to the Church of St . George , where the summit and signing took_place . Yeltsin , however , appeared to be having a grand time , staying_on the yacht of Greek magnate Yannis Latsis . The Itar-Tass news_agency reported that the Russian president , who has denied serious health_problems but frequently appears fatigued , would stay_on for a_few days_of_rest on Corfu .</TEXT>
