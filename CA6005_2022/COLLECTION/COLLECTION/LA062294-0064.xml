   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR PLUNGES ; MARKETS FOLLOW ; ECONOMY : WORLDWIDE INFLATION WORRIES AND A SURPRISE SURGE IN THE U.S. TRADE_DEFICIT ARE BLAMED FOR THE CURRENCY ' S FALL . ANOTHER INTEREST_RATE INCREASE MAY RESULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Worldwide inflation jitters Tuesday sent the dollar plummeting against the yen and other foreign currencies , pounding the stock and bond markets and raising new fears of an interest_rate hike that could threaten the nation ' s economic recovery . The dollar fell briefly below the once-unthinkable barrier of 100 yen , its decline hastened by new figures showing that the U.S. trade_deficit surged an unexpected 22.1 % in April to $ 8.4 billion . The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 33.93 points , bringing the indicator ' s six-day losses to 2.7 % . &quot; It ' s just a pervasive nervousness about developments all_over the world , with inflation fears underlying it all , &quot; said Robert D . Hormats , vice_chairman of Goldman , Sachs International . &quot; It ' s worrisome because so_much of the U.S. recovery has depended_on low interest_rates . And , if this raises rates for a sustained period , that will slow the recovery. &quot; The continued market turbulence generally mirrored declines in Europe and Asia and raised some expectation that central_banks would begin buying_up billions in dollars to reverse the slide . But for the moment , Clinton_Administration officials only repeated their insistence that the economy ' s condition does not justify the dollar ' s fall and withheld action . By raising fears of inflation , the fall also caused bond buyers to worry about erosion in the value of their investments . And the prospect of higher bond yields in turn led some stock investors to sell_off their shares_in expectations of higher yields in bonds . &quot; The markets are seeing weakness everywhere , &quot; said Ian Spence , a senior currency trader with Chemical Bank in New York . &quot; It ' s just feeding_on itself. &quot; Investors fear that inflation will trigger another round of interest_rate hikes in the United States , slowing the economy and hurting investments in_stocks and bonds . Many investors respond by moving their investments into foreign currencies , which drives down the value of the dollar against those currencies . A secondary factor , some traders said , was investors ' lack of confidence that the Administration is up_to the task of handling the political and economic problems it faces , from North_Korea to Bosnia . Inflation concerns recently have been fanned by signs that commodities -- notably oil -- are seeing worrisome price rises . Although the Federal_Reserve does not make_it a practice to raise interest_rates as a means of stabilizing the dollar , some economists said they believe that the Fed ' s governors might want to offset an inflationary_spiral caused by the falling dollar . A cheaper dollar raises the cost of_imports for consumers . Wayne D . Angell , chief economist at Bear Stearns &amp; Co . and a former Fed governor , predicted that the Federal_Reserve would raise rates July 5 at the next meeting of the Fed ' s Open Market Committee . At the same time , there have been signs that German interest_rates might be rising . Lothar Klausing , an economist with the Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt , attributed the dollar ' s continued weakness to expectations that German rates might soon increase , as well as_to concerns over the U.S.-Japanese trade conflict and fears of inflation ' s effects on U.S. bonds . &quot; There are inflation fears , &quot; he said . &quot; And people have no confidence as_to U.S. interest rates. &quot; Still , Klausing and several U.S. analysts said the dollar ' s fall might yet be an overreaction to an American economy that continues to display many signs of strength . Foreign investors fear that a falling dollar will lead to higher interest_rates because the Fed often uses interest_rate increases to reverse such declines . The Fed does so because higher interest_rates attract more foreign investors to U.S. currency , increasing the value of the dollar . Spence , of Chemical Bank , said traders have expected to see central_banks begin buying_up currency in the past several days . &quot; When they didn ' t , that just added fuel to the fire , &quot; he said . On May 4 , central_banks intervened massively to try to stabilize the dollar in a move orchestrated by Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen . Now , however , the Treasury_Department apparently hopes that the dollar ' s slide is nearing an end . Hormats , of Goldman Sachs , said the dollar ' s turbulence reflects in part the enormous growth of dollar holdings abroad . During the 1980s , about $ 170 billion flowed to foreign investors annually because of large trade_deficits . In this decade , those levels have been swollen by foreign direct investment and other factors , so the annual outflow now is closer to about $ 250 billion a year . &quot; And if foreigners start seeing that they can ' t hold those dollars at a stable currency rate , they can get nervous -- and start to sell , &quot; Hormats said . In addition to dipping below the 100-yen barrier , the dollar also dropped below the critical 1.60 level against the deutsche_mark . The dollar ended Tuesday at 100.35 yen , down from 101.90 on Monday . It was a postwar record closing low . The dollar also ended at 1.594 German marks , down from 1.60 and the lowest since May , 1993 . The benchmark 30-year bond yield rose to 7.49 % from 7.46 % on Monday . The last time the yield hit that level was May 13 . The price of the bonds dropped 3 / 8 , or $ 3.75 per $ 1 # 000 of face_value . The Dow ' s fall marked its lowest close since May 9 . Times staff writer Marjorie Miller in Bonn contributed to this story . Key Questions Q : What is depressing the dollar ? A : Economists can ' t find solid explanations . They are attributing the slide mainly to negative sentiment toward the U.S. currency in the global foreign-exchange market . Some say this reflects a lack of confidence in the Clinton_Administration ' s foreign_policy , particularly negotiations with Japan over its trade surplus . Many money traders believe that Washington wants to keep the yen high , which in the long_run should depress Japan ' s exports by making them more expensive . Trade figures released Tuesday showed that the Japanese surplus with the United States remains huge , putting more downward pressure on the dollar . Q : What does this mean for consumers ? A : Not very much , at least in the near term . Although the dollar ' s purchasing power has weakened abroad , importers have so far been absorbing higher costs for cars , appliances and other items . But if the dollar continues to weaken over the next several months , prices for imports could rise and domestic manufacturers might opt to boost prices as well . That could fuel inflation . People traveling_to Europe and Japan will find that they can ' t buy as much with their dollars .</TEXT>
