   <HEADLINE> HOME COOK : A LEEK IN THE SOUP POT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like most home cooks , I tend to repeat a great new recipe until it is no longer welcome -- like a house_guest that stays more_than three days . These days , leek and potato soup is an endangered soup in my house because I ' ve cooked it at least five times in the last two weeks . In my defense , the soups I ' ve cooked have not been exactly alike . After trying several variations on my basic recipe , I became curious about the classic French version of leek and potato soup ( potage Parmentier ) and turned_to Julia Child ' s &quot; Mastering the Art of French Cooking. &quot; As usual , she has something appropriate : a simple combination of potatoes and leeks stewed in water , pureed and then enriched with cream . My recipe is slightly different because the vegetables ( I like a little celery in the mix ) are cooked in water and milk , and I don ' t add cream . And if you want to make vichyssoise , add four cups of water instead of three and reduce the milk from three cups to two cups . Cook as directed . After pureeing and cooling the soup , add one cup of heavy_cream and chill before serving . The arugula and iceberg salad will surprise you if you have never mixed these greens . This is an example of opposites that really do attract . The dark-green leaves of arugula taste sharp and peppery in contrast to the crisp , delicate iceberg leaves . Arugula can be found in many supermarkets , and most farmers markets have a good variety of seasonal salad makings such_as arugula ( also called rocket ) , cress , loose-leaf and lots of fresh herbs . LEEK AND POTATO SOUP 3 tablespoons butter 6 small or 3 large leeks , well washed and thinly sliced 3 stalks celery with leaves , thinly sliced 3 cups water 2 medium potatoes , peeled and diced 3 cups milk Salt , pepper Melt butter in large pot . Add leeks and celery . Cook 10 minutes over moderate heat , stirring often . Stir in water , potatoes and milk . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Cover and cook over low heat about 20 minutes more . Stir every 10 minutes , so vegetables don ' t stick_to bottom of pot . Remove from heat when potatoes are done . Put soup into food_processor or through food mill . Puree until smooth . Add more milk or water if soup is too thick . Soup should be as thick as heavy_cream . Serve hot . Makes 6 servings .
