   <HEADLINE> WOODY HITS BULL ' S-EYE AT MIRAMAX ; MOVIES : AFTER BEING SHUNNED BY HOLLYWOOD OVER A DOMESTIC SCANDAL , THE WRITER-DIRECTOR HAS STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE COMPANY TO RELEASE HIS FILM ' BULLETS OVER BROADWAY. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Woody Allen -- the New York movie icon who fell from grace after an explosive custody_battle with Mia Farrow and child sexual abuse allegations clouded his career -- is back in business with Hollywood . The 58-year-old Oscar-winning writer-director has made a deal with Miramax Films , the distributor of such provocative titles as &quot; The Crying Game &quot; and &quot; The Piano , &quot; to release his latest movie , &quot; Bullets Over Broadway , &quot; which completed filming earlier this year . A gritty period comedy about gangsters and showgirls in New York in the ' 20s , the picture features an ensemble cast that includes John Cusack , Debi Mazar , Chazz Palminteri , Mary-Louise Parker , Rob Reiner , Jennifer Tilly , Tracey Ullman , Dianne Wiest and Jim Broadbent . Allen , who directed but does not appear in the film , co-wrote the screenplay with Doug McGrath . Miramax , which acquired U.S. and Canadian distribution rights from the film ' s executive producer , Jean Doumanian , plans to release &quot; Bullets &quot; this fall . Doumanian , a longtime friend of Allen ' s and former &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; producer who has a three-picture deal with the filmmaker , raised $ 20 million in foreign money to finance his film . Foreign rights on &quot; Bullets &quot; have not been sold , though Miramax is in discussions about possibly acquiring them as well . While Allen was shunned by Hollywood ' s movie community after his highly publicized courtroom war with Farrow last year , as well as his affair with her oldest adopted daughter , it ' s no surprise he would team with an unconventional company like the New York-based Miramax , which is in his own back yard and is run_by the scrappy brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein . &quot; Shunned by Hollywood means nothing to Miramax . We ' re talking_about a comic genius , &quot; Harvey Weinstein said Thursday . &quot; Chaplin was shunned by Hollywood ; so were a great many other international filmmakers , including Fellini -- and those are the people who belong with Miramax. &quot; Weinstein was enthusiastic about the film , describing it as &quot; a very funny exploration of the friendship between a young playwright ( Cusack ) and young hit_man ( Palminteri ) . &quot; Allen , who is currently writing his next movie , was not available for comment . When asked how the family image-sensitive Walt Disney Co. , which now owns Miramax , might feel about associating with Allen ( who before the scandal had starred in the studio ' s &quot; Scenes From a Mall &quot; and &quot; New York Stories &quot; ) , Weinstein said , &quot; When we contacted Disney and told them , they were thrilled. &quot; Miramax operates autonomously in marketing and distributing its movies . Under the terms of the Miramax deal , Allen gets complete creative control over the marketing of his movie , which could make the new arrangement with Miramax interesting , since the Weinsteins are known for their marketing acumen and have always controlled the campaigns . * Doumanian , speaking by phone from Switzerland , said , &quot; Harvey and Bob have been_well advised that Woody has creative control over anything that has to do with marketing , but they are good salesmen so Woody will be very willing to listen to their input. &quot; Weinstein added , &quot; This is a very special movie and our mission is to give it the kind of success it deserves. &quot; Weinstein said Miramax hopes &quot; Bullets &quot; will be the first of many films Allen will make with the studio . &quot; As we try to build our own United Artists ( the onetime distributor of other Allen films ) , we view this relationship with Woody as the cornerstone of what we ' re trying to do. &quot; Hollywood -- which had long clamored to be in business with the iconoclastic Allen despite that his movies generally didn ' t make money -- distanced itself from the filmmaker last year when the public custody_battle with longtime companion Farrow revealed intimate details of the former lovers ' private lives . Farrow had accused Allen of sexual abuse of their adopted daughter , Dylan , and of destroying his relationship with his other children by having an affair with Farrow ' s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn . No abuse charges were ever brought against Allen and Farrow was awarded custody of their three young children . Questions about Allen ' s future viability in Hollywood swirled last July when it was announced Allen ' s production deal with TriStar was ending prematurely with one picture still remaining on a three-picture deal . Allen directed two films for that studio ; the second , &quot; Manhattan Murder Mystery , &quot; grossed only $ 11.2 million domestically , and &quot; Husbands and Wives , &quot; whose story line bore an eerie resemblance to some of the real-life drama between Allen and Farrow , a mere $ 10.5 million in the United States and Canada . Ending his relationship with TriStar , Allen then signed a financing deal with Doumanian , who is also producer of Allen ' s upcoming ABC-TV movie &quot; Don ' t Drink the Water , &quot; which stars Michael J . Fox . The expected air date is September for the teleplay , which Allen adapted from his 1966 stage play . It was first turned_into a movie in 1969 ; it starred Jackie Gleason and Estelle Parsons . Doumanian , who has a three-picture deal with ABC , is also co-producing with Julian Schlossberg , a trio of one-act plays written by Allen , David Mamet and Elaine May , which will be mounted Off Broadway next year .</TEXT>
