   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON THE SIMPSON CASE ; A SHAM INDICTMENT PROCESS ; THE GRAND_JURY WAS MEANT TO BE A BUFFER BETWEEN PEOPLE AND STATE . THE D.A. IS USING IT TO GAIN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the past week , a grand_jury has been considering whether to issue an indictment agains O.J. Simpson , based on evidence from the Los Angeles County District_Attorney ' s Office . Let ' s consider what the jury is probably not being told by the D.A. Grand_juries originally had a special role in our criminal-justice system . In the Bill of Rights , they receive special mention in the Fifth_Amendment , separate from the right to trial by a 12-person petit_jury . A grand_jury was intended to guarantee that a panel of private citizens would stand between the power of the state -- police , prosecutor and judge -- and the individual in criminal prosecutions . Thus , under our federal system , no person can be charged with a felony without a grand_jury first voting to indict the suspect based on a finding of probable_cause . In California , the state has an alternative procedure . The state can first charge a person without a grand_jury . But then the state must hold a preliminary hearing within a very short period_of_time to determine probable_cause . This is the procedure that was used to arrest and charge Simpson . His preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday . The district_attorney ' s use of the grand_jury in the Simpson case is a distortion of everything for which it was intended . In truth , the district_attorney is using the grand_jury as a tool of the prosecution , to obtain special advantages for the trial before a petit_jury . At this point the grand_jury has no power to perform its essential function , to serve as a buffer between the individual and the state before charges are filed . The charges are already filed , and no matter what the grand_jury does , the D.A. will still proceed with the prosecution . Therefore the grand_jury proceedings are meaningless . The grand_jury is being exploited in a way unintended by our Constitution . The district_attorney is conducting one-sided depositions without attorneys for the defense being present or participating or being able to take any depositions themselves . Members of the grand_jury should be true_to their great and ancient tradition as an independent body . They should tell the district_attorney that , since he has chosen to proceed without submitting first to the constitutional protections of a grand_jury , that he should proceed with the preliminary hearing , which is the appropriate protection for such unilateral action . What we are seeing here is a sham indictment process -- the D.A. pretending that the grand_jury ' s decision will have some meaning , when the real purpose is to obtain hidden and unfair tactical advantages from a one-sided process that was never intended for that purpose . The grand_jury ' s very existence is intended to give private citizens the power to rein_in the state when it uses its laws and authority for improper or unintended purposes . The grand_jury has the power to simply say &quot; no &quot; to the district_attorney -- and should do so . By doing so , the grand_jury would not be freeing Simpson or preventing the state from prosecuting him . It would simply be making the statement that the government must follow both the letter and spirit of our laws and our Constitution .</TEXT>
