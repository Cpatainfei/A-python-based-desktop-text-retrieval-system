   <HEADLINE> ARCADIA POLICE ACCUSED OF RACIAL , SEXUAL BIAS ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : FOUR CLAIMS CHARGE THAT THE CITY ' S 73-MEMBER FORCE HAS TARGETED YOUNG PEOPLE , MINORITIES AND THE DEPARTMENT ' S OWN FEMALE OFFICERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the last year , the Arcadia Police_Department has been hit by four separate claims of racial and sexual discrimination . Those filing the claims accuse the city ' s 73-member force of unfairly targeting young people , minorities and the department ' s own female officers for harassment and discrimination . The accusations are detailed in a $ 1-million claim against the city , a federal discrimination complaint and two recent lawsuits , including one seeking $ 1 million in damages . &quot; I think the face of our community is changing , &quot; said 10-year resident Alicia Alfaro , one of the complainants . &quot; We ' re seeing more and more brown faces in our community and I don ' t think these officers have been sensitized to that. &quot; City officials deny the accusations . &quot; The Arcadia Police_Department is an extremely professional organization , &quot; said Arcadia Police Capt . David Hinig . &quot; We can on any given day make several thousand contacts with the public . The number of people who come_forward and make this type of complaint is very small , two or three people , that ' s all. &quot; City Atty . Mike Miller characterized all_the complaints as &quot; unproven , speculative , general allegations without any support. &quot; &quot; I think they have defamed the Arcadia Police_Department , &quot; Miller added . Those making accusations against the department are : * Beverly Hayden , owner of the Burger Palace , who filed a $ 1-million federal lawsuit in July alleging that Arcadia police discriminated against young people and Latino customers at her &quot; classic car night &quot; by targeting them for increased traffic scrutiny and citations . Hayden says problems arose in 1989 when she began the car shows Thursday nights at her restaurant on West Las Tunas Drive . The events drew_up to 400 people , many of them young Latinos , who displayed their vehicles in the restaurant parking_lot . In response , Arcadia police created a special task_force using officers from El Monte and Glendale , as well as Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department deputies and California Highway Patrol officers . The task_force strictly enforced traffic and vehicle code violations near the restaurant three Thursdays in a row last year in July . More_than 300 of her customers were ticketed , Hayden said , which shut_down the car club and discouraged customers from visiting on other evenings . In her lawsuit , filed July 8 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , Hayden seeks $ 1 million in compensatory damages , $ 50 # 000 in punitive damages and an injunction to end police surveillance and enforcement at the restaurant . But Hinig said police paid special attention to the business only because it drew alleged gang members and drug dealers , as well as complaints from neighboring businesses and residents . Police arrested one drag racer who , after leaving the Burger Palace , sped at 100 m.p.h. on nearby streets , he said . * Gus and Alicia Alfaro , who filed a $ 1-million damage complaint against the city in March , also accused Arcadia officers of harassing Latinos , specifically their son , Gus Jr . The Alfaros say their son , then 14 , was harassed by police_officers in August , 1993 , as he stood outside a house with his friends ; in September , 1993 , as he was walking to a football game with other boys , and on Oct . 14 , 1993 , at a football game at Arcadia High_School . Alicia Alfaro said other youths have told her of similar treatment , but they are reluctant to come_forward . Although her son has not been physically harmed , she fears that he could be singled_out for more and harsher treatment unless she speaks_up . City officials dismiss the Alfaros ' complaints as frivolous and unfounded . Police said that the boy refused to sit_down in the bleachers when ordered to do so by officers and that he cursed at the officers , prompting their response . An internal police_department investigation of all_the Alfaro ' s complaints found no police misconduct , Hinig said . * Deborah Pierce , a former Arcadia probationary police_officer who filed a discrimination lawsuit after she was fired last year , and a woman cadet who filed a federal discrimination complaint in April both accuse the department of sexual_harassment and discrimination . In her complaint , Pierce , 30 , claims that racist and sexist attitudes translated into discriminatory on-the-job actions against women and minority Arcadia residents . Pierce , who worked for the Arcadia Police_Department from June 24 , 1991 , until her firing on Jan . 20 , 1993 , said she was shocked to find that Asians , Latinos and African Americans were targeted for extra field interrogations , searches and traffic stops to discourage them from entering the city . Police_officers freely used racial epithets and jokes and regularly &quot; roughed_up &quot; people_of_color , Pierce claims in her lawsuit . She herself was sexually harassed by one officer , exposed to X-rated videos watched by officers in the station break room during their dinner hour and was the target of unfounded rumors of sexual misconduct , she said . She alleges that her performance ratings declined and she was fired when she complained . Her complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , filed_in October , is pending . Meanwhile , in January she filed a civil lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior_Court . Pierce ' s attorney , David Fertig of Pasadena , said he also is handling a similar complaint filed_in April , 1993 , with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by a former female Arcadia police cadet . Fertig declined to give the woman ' s name but in documents filed with the EEOC the woman alleges sexual_harassment similar to that claimed by Pierce . The Arcadia Police_Department conceded that it has no African American police_officers . But six officers are female , eight are Latino and two are Asian American , according to Arcadia Personnel_Department documents . Arcadia Police_Chief Neal R . Johnson said his department is sensitive to ethnic and sexual issues . Two years ago , department captains and lieutenants were trained to recognize and prevent sexual_harassment . The information from the sessions was passed down to patrol officers , he said . Further , the department conducts outreach programs to the city ' s Asian community using awareness videos and printed materials . Arcadia police also declined to give details about the firing of Pierce and the female cadet because of the pending litigation . But they said both women were fired for justifiable reasons . The department ' s 18-month probation period sometimes weeds_out those that initially appear to be good candidates , said Hinig , who added , &quot; You can look good on paper but if you can ' t perform in the field , then the employment is terminated. &quot; Chief Johnson said Pierce ' s discrimination lawsuit is a first for the department . The city has never paid damages in a discrimination lawsuit , he added . The chief questioned how his department could even be accused of discriminating against women and youths . His officers take their lead from him , he said , citing his 26-year involvement with youth car clubs , 36 years of volunteering for Boy_Scout activities and his post as coordinator and founder of a Boy_Scout Explorers police_academy . Further , Johnson , a former Arcadia Citizen of the Year , was twice awarded a national Scouting award for his work with youths .</TEXT>
