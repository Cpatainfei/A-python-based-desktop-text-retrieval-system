   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE GUINEA_PIGS FOR SCIENCE OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Know how to make a small_fortune through innovative investments ? Start with a large one . . . . No doubt , the folks in Orange County don ' t find that joke quite so funny these days . But all these exotic derivatives and leveraged synthetics that got Orange County in_trouble are really the products of the last major wave of financial innovations . They ' re the software spinoffs of financial theories that began seeping from academe into the investment world back in the early 1970s . In pure monetary terms , it ' s been the most significant technology transfer of the postwar era . Trillions of dollars , yen and Deutschmarks are traded on these equations . But now technology is creating new playgrounds for theory . Twenty years ago , chess was the key experimental medium for artificial_intelligence research . Today , as academic researchers look_at &quot; neural nets &quot; that can be trained to detect data patterns and &quot; genetic algorithms &quot; that literally breed software solutions to complex problems , they ' re going to the most dynamic , versatile and data-rich research medium in the world : the financial markets . Neural network software doesn ' t merely execute commands , but actually constructs models of the world by establishing connections between seemingly disparate bits of data , in ways somewhat analogous to the living brain . Conversely , genetic algorithms literally evolve software according to Darwinian principles of fitness . As computer processors become more powerful and less expensive , &quot; growing &quot; solutions becomes practical . And the stock_markets , the bond markets , the options &amp; futures markets and the foreign_exchange markets are now becoming the E . coli and Drosophila of these areas of advanced computer research ; what fruits_flies and lab rats are to biology , financial markets are becoming for complex software . The markets offer a superb research domain to rigorously test pattern-recognition and solution-finding in complex systems . And , if the software works , you can make a_few extra bucks along the way . &quot; It ' s not the only medium for attack but it ' s certainly a key one , &quot; acknowledges USC Computer_Science Professor Bart Kosko , who specializes in fuzzy_logic research . &quot; This will be a fast-growing area . . . . Look_at the billions of dollars that have been spent on model-based techniques to analyze the markets -- like charts and the Black-Scholes Options Pricing equations . By contrast , these technologies let us play with ' model-free ' techniques -- to let the data tell their own story if there is a story to be told . So I think it ' s obvious that there ' s going_to be a lot of research in this area and that financial markets will be a major part of that research . &quot; In fact , &quot; Kosko notes , &quot; one of my students ( has developed software ) for prediction of gold market prices. &quot; &quot; I think there is another revolution going_on but , never having done one of these things , I ' m a little suspicious of it , &quot; asserts Peter Bernstein , founding editor of the Journal of Portfolio Management and author of &quot; Capital Ideas , &quot; a history of the rise of the financial theorists on Wall_Street . &quot; The dream of having all this stuff measurable and predictable is an irrepressible dream. &quot; But Bernstein observes that the people developing genetic algorithms and neural nets &quot; don ' t come from economics or finance , so I ' m not really on their frequency. &quot; Much as the Wall_Street investment houses eventually lured big-name academic financial theorists to their firms to help design a new generation of financial instruments , they are now sending their &quot; quants &quot; to academic conferences on neural nets and genetic algorithms to cherry-pick ideas and recruit consultants . &quot; It ' s what people talk_about on the floor of these conferences and between the sessions , &quot; says Larry O ' Brien , editor of AI in Finance , a magazine that was launched earlier this year . &quot; Every trading house has their rocket scientists looking_at this . It is the primary thing ; it is the current Holy Grail. &quot; &quot; It used to be weather ; now they ' re using financial markets , &quot; observes Susan Webber of Jaquish Advisers , who has worked extensively with options traders . &quot; Certainly , data capture has gotten a lot better . A few years ago , all that people had was end-of-day price data . Now we have prices all through the day so , if there are patterns to detect or parameters to define , there is a lot better data to work with . It ' s certainly a happy coincidence that financial markets make such a good research tool , &quot; she adds , &quot; but , frankly , I don ' t think it ' s just a coincidence. &quot; But the point that academics stress is that financial markets offer a tremendous resource for exploring new concepts in pattern recognition and software design . &quot; It certainly has all_the right characteristics of a challenging , worthy problem , &quot; says Stanford Consulting Computer_Science Professor John Koza , author of &quot; Genetic Programming , &quot; a best-selling text in the field . &quot; It certainly has the potential to be self-funding. &quot; But &quot; no one knows if it is even possible to model these things or if the markets are so efficient or so chaotic that they don ' t matter . . . . I ' m personally not doing anything in financial services but I know several people who are. &quot; However , Koza adds , &quot; This may be one of those rare research areas where people prefer to publish their failed experiments rather than their successful ones. &quot; Will a misguided neural net investment or a mutating genetic algorithm hedge help plunge a municipality into bankruptcy 20 years hence ? It ' s far too early to say what the impact of these emerging software genres will be_on financial investment . But recently , a computer chess program beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov in several games of speed chess . Could beating Warren Buffet be that much more difficult ? * Michael Schrage is a writer , consultant and research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
