   <TEXT> SO FAR , SO GOOD : A Memoir by Burgess Meredith ( Little , Brown : $ 22.95 ; 288 pp. ) Burgess Meredith may have waited a heartbeat too long . He ' s been busy . that ' s good , for those who appreciate a solid performance : To this day , Meredith has never , ever disappointed . that ' s not so good for his biography , which is inclined to ramble , to peter_out . Of course , Meredith ' s peter is a lesser man ' s pizazz . Meredith is 83 , or 85 , or something like that ( you know how actors are ) . Started acting in the late ' 20s , and never stopped . Knew everybody , worked with most , slept_with not a_few ( Tallulah Bankhead ; the heavenly Hedy Lamarr ; Marlene Dietrich ; Ingrid Bergman , most likely ; and others still breathing , thus exempt from a gentleman ' s memoirs ) . &quot; God knows I was not a dashing swain , &quot; he writes , &quot; but in a kind of mongrel way I chased the foxes. &quot; Raised_hell with roomie Jimmy Stewart . Hunted for sunken treasure with John Steinbeck . Married Paulette Goddard , after Charlie Chaplin , before Erich Maria Remarque . Smoked opium and recited Joyce with James Mason in a Hong Kong hotel_room . Cruised the Sea of Cortez with John Huston looking_for the meaning of life . Made Joe McCarthy ' s &quot; red channel &quot; list -- and won an Emmy for playing Joseph Welsh in &quot; Tail Gunner Joe. &quot; Schmoozed under the stars with Harry Hopkins on the lawn of Roosevelt ' s White_House ( Franklin , not Teddy ) . As an Air Corps officer , persuaded Cole Porter to write a song for the Glider Division . ( &quot; ' Glide , glider , glide , for Christ ' s sake , ' said the general . ' You don ' t want me to take that to the guys , do you ? ' &quot; ) They ' re here , all_of them , Katherine Cornell to Sly Stallone , James Baldwin , Orson Welles , Aldous Huxley , Ernie Pyle , Henry Fonda , Gorgeous Gussie , Brecht and Weill and Lenya ; Brando and Thurber ; Zero Mostel learning to walk like a geisha ; agnostic Charles Laughton reading the Bible over the radio . There are also snippets of wisdom on acting , directing -- living -- and all sorts of meandering fun , and one can only marvel at what the old actor must have forgotten . Still , the next time he says , &quot; I remember the time that . . . &quot; prick_up your ears . It ' s bound to be choice .</TEXT>
