   <TEXT> &quot; Give us this day our daily bread &quot; is a call to action for religious relief workers such_as the Rev . Don Hargis , disaster relief coordinator for the Southern Baptist Convention who is overseeing preparation of about 90 # 000 hot meals daily for earthquake victims in Southern California . The meals are cooked by Southern Baptist Convention and Seventh-day Adventist volunteers and distributed free by the Red_Cross at Van Nuys Airport and four other locations in the San Fernando Valley . Whether on the scene or behind it raising money and collecting clothing , furniture and household goods , religious communities are lending a hand and a dollar , moral support and spiritual succor to victims of the Jan . 17 earthquake . Hargis , who is based in Fresno , has greeted about 200 Southern Baptist women and men who have taken time from their jobs in Texas , Louisiana , Missouri , Oklahoma , Mississippi and California to volunteer in trained units that operate field kitchens out of tractor-trailers and a commercial catering van . About 250 other volunteers have helped cleanup efforts . Sixty Adventist volunteers a day staff two shifts in the denomination ' s mobile kitchen . Unlike the Baptists , Adventists have used almost all local volunteers -- more_than 800 so far . Religious relief workers are experienced with disasters and with Southern California . &quot; We were here for the riots , feeding people , and to help people sandbag and clean_up during the Malibu and Laguna fires , &quot; Hargis said . Hargis ' volunteers dish_out religion with meals . &quot; Always , &quot; he said . &quot; We always tell them that Jesus loves them and that ' s why we go_to help them . &quot; Anyone can offer help , &quot; he added . &quot; I believe that only God can offer hope , and I believe that that ' s what people are looking_for when everything is crumbling around them. &quot; The disaster relief ministry was founded 25 years ago , shortly after Southern Baptist scouts got caught in a hurricane near Corpus Christi , Tex. , and began cooking food for the survivors . After the 1985 Mexico_City earthquake , it signed an agreement with the American Red_Cross to cook meals for disaster victims . Although their disaster readiness may be more well-honed than that of some_other religious organizations , the Baptists ' and Adventists ' spirit and sense of mission are emblematic of the response of religious communities across the board that are offering help on a non-sectarian basis . Locally , the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council has been working to link resources and individuals in need . It is seeking donations of food , household goods and clothing , repair and building services . Call ( 818 ) 718-6460 for information or to request help .

Box 968 , Elkhart , Ind . 46515. ) The Conservative movement of Judaism has established the United Synagogue of Conservative_Judaism Natural Disaster Relief Fund ( 155 5th Ave. , New York , N.Y. 10010 ) , and the Aid Assn . for Lutherans has stepped_up its donation-matching program . ( Aid Assn . for Lutherans , 431 N . Ballard Road , Appleton , Wis . 54919-0001. ) The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South_America allocated $ 25 # 000 and called_upon members to contribute to its Greek Orthodox Archdiocese Earthquake Victims Fund ( 10 E . 79th St. , New York , N.Y. 10021 ) . Another offer of help came from Taiwan . The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu-Chi Foundation pledged $ 500 # 000 to help Santa Clarita Valley ' s poorest residents displaced by the quake and also wants to aid Sylmar and Santa Monica quake victims . Why do these groups and others want to help ? Hargis says , &quot; Within all_of us there is that innate longing to help . I believe that when people hear there are others hurting , they think , ' Hey , this could be me. ' &quot; For the locations of Southern Baptist-Red Cross feeding stations , call ( 818 ) 781-3818 .
