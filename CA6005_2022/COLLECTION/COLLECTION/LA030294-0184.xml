   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : THE ECONOMY : NEW FEARS OVER INFLATION ; GREENSPAN USES GOLD AS HEDGE FOR FUTURE INTEREST_RATE HIKES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite strange talk by Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan , the price of gold doesn ' t have much , if anything , to do with the U.S. economy , or with the rate_of_inflation . So it ' s a mystery why the Fed chairman told Congress in testimony last week that gold &quot; has shown a consistent lead_on inflation expectations and has been over the years a reasonably good indicator of inflation. &quot; In fact , the record of the last decade shows no such thing . While U.S. inflation in the 1980s averaged 4.7 % a year , the price of gold seesawed violently and declined 3.4 % a year on average . Why did Greenspan , who knows that record , declare that he uses the gold price as a guide in making interest_rate policy ? Fed chairmen don ' t explain their statements , but it just may be that Greenspan is using gold as a stalking horse , a handy cover allowing him to exert a moderating influence on the strengthening economy . To that end , he ' s been using small hikes in short-term interest_rates and a lot of scare talk_about gold and industrial commodities , such_as nickel , aluminum and copper . Some price inflation is showing_up in those commodities , the National Assn . of Purchasing Management reported Tuesday . But even there , professional &quot; hedge_funds &quot; pouring vast pools of investment into commodities may be distorting the markets . To the extent that speculative buying of commodity futures , rather than real industrial demand , has pushed_up metals prices , those prices are subject_to downdraft . In other words , there may be less than meets the eye in inflation statistics . What really is happening with gold is that there is an increased worldwide demand for it in jewelry , especially in developing countries . Jewelry demand has risen to more_than 80 million ounces , from 27 million a decade ago . Global consumption has outrun new gold production for the last four years , with the shortfall being made_up from gold scrap , sales by central_banks and other means . Yet there seems to be no shortage of the yellow_metal . Through most of the unprecedented rise in jewelry demand , the price of gold has been declining . Even today , with production all but shut_down in the former Soviet_Union , the price remains less than $ 400 an ounce . Leading analyst Ian MacDonald of Credit Suisse doesn ' t expect gold to &quot; go screaming up. &quot; But he does predict it will go above $ 400 , from about $ 382 now . The story on gold these days , unlike in the 1970s , has little to do with hedging against U.S. inflation and a lot to do with purchases of jewelry in China , says analyst Vahid Fathi of Kemper Securities . There is new wealth in a rapidly growing economy in China and a desire to buy something that might hold its value amid inflation running 15 % a year . Chinese purchases now account_for almost 14 % of global jewelry sales . The tradition in India is that even poor farmers buy gold jewelry for dowries . Now there is more cash circulating in India ' s economy and farmers are buying more jewelry . That reflection of rising living standards is occurring in many developing countries , where people have always valued gold for its stability . In Turkey , a gold exchange has opened in Istanbul to draw hoarded gold out of households and into circulation , boosting the economy . In any event , gold fever in Shanghai and Bombay has little to do with the U.S. economy . Even the gold jewelry sold there is different from the trinkets in U.S. stores . Bracelets and rings typically are 24-karat , pure gold and priced on their gold content . But in U.S. jewelry_stores , the price of 14-karat bracelets and rings reflects the jeweler ' s art and the merchant ' s markup ; it is far beyond the gold value . Anyway , gold is not much of an investment , paying no interest or dividends and as likely to fall_in value as go_up . Investment manager Kenneth Fisher of Fisher Investments in Woodside , Calif. , predicts a long downward trend for gold ' s price , based on increased production and a_leveling off in_demand . He is also skeptical of most high-flying metals prices , reckoning that inflation pressures will remain low in a world where economic efficiency is improving . And the possibility that gold might fall is a further hint that Greenspan sees it as a useful scapegoat for action he may have to take_to control the economy . If the price of gold goes_up , the Fed chairman can use that fact as an excuse to raise short-term interest_rates . If it goes_down , that may persuade the markets to bring bond rates back_down gain . Greenspan ' s motive is clear and commendable : He wants to prevent inflation from seeping into the economy and influencing wages , cost-of-living adjustments for Medicare and labor_union contracts and the assumptions businesses make about investment returns . Inflation , like carbon_monoxide , is insidious and deadly . Global investors have been jumpy lately because they detect something in the air . that ' s why stocks and bonds are falling . But , like Greenspan ' s reference_to the price of gold , it may only be a false alarm .</TEXT>
