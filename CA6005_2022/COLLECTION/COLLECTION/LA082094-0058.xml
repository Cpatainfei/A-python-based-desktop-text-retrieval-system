   <HEADLINE> CITING RUSSIA IN NUCLEAR SMUGGLING COULD BACKFIRE , EXPERTS CAUTION ; GERMANY : AFTER SEIZURES OF PLUTONIUM , ANY FINGER-POINTING COULD CAUSE MOSCOW TO WITHHOLD COOPERATION ON SECURITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a top German official headed here with evidence of nuclear smuggling from Russia , specialists in both countries warned Friday that harsh finger-pointing at Moscow could undermine international efforts to secure its vast stockpiles of bomb-making materials . The seizure of more_than 10 ounces of deadly plutonium in a suitcase flown from Moscow to Munich last week set_off alarms in Germany about the disarray of Russia ' s nuclear Establishment , which lacks a full inventory of its weapons-grade uranium and plutonium . But the alarm itself raised a new threat , officials and nuclear specialists here and in the West say . They noted that public blame of Russia ' s lax security has irritated the military and civilian bureaucrats who control the stockpile and resist any scrutiny by outsiders . Russia ' s readiness to help find the origin of the plutonium , the largest quantity of weapons-grade nuclear contraband ever seized , will be tested after a team led by Germany ' s intelligence coordinator , Bernd Schmidbauer , arrives in Moscow today with data from the lab that analyzed it . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the team of senior intelligence officials and nuclear scientists will urge Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin to tighten controls and reassure the Germans , whose police have seized three smaller shipments of stolen nuclear material since May . &quot; We have to tell our Russian friends , ' You must guarantee that these possibilities for theft are reduced as much as possible , ' &quot; Kohl said on German television . &quot; We are not talking_about car theft here . We ' re talking_about dangers that are far different. &quot; Since the collapse of the Soviet_Union , Kohl has made his country Russia ' s biggest aid donor and last month helped bring Yeltsin into the exclusive club grouping leaders of the seven richest industrial nations . The Bonn-Moscow partnership is viewed_as an anchor of stability in Europe . But as they have done on a range of other contentious issues from Bosnia-Herzegovina to the expansion of NATO , Russia and Germany showed this week how troubled a partnership it is . The sniping started Monday , in edgy Cold_War rhetoric . The Germans announced they had laboratory evidence of Russian manufacture for the plutonium-239 in the suitcase . &quot; Pure fabrication , &quot; the Russians shot back , arguing that the German effort was aimed at boosting Kohl ' s party in the Oct . 16 elections and justifying foreign control over Russia ' s nuclear_power industry . Russia ' s Federal Counterintelligence Service insisted that &quot; not a single gram &quot; of plutonium-239 was missing . German commentators said the denials recalled Chernobyl , the 1986 nuclear_reactor disaster that Moscow covered_up for 16 days . Unnamed &quot; nuclear experts &quot; told Russia ' s Interfax news_agency that &quot; it is no coincidence &quot; that all these &quot; so-called nuclear smuggling incidents &quot; are reported from Germany , where &quot; a strong black_market in radioactive materials &quot; invites contraband from the world over . German police , it turned_out , knew that plutonium smugglers were aboard the flight from Moscow to Munich on Aug . 10 . When Moscow vented outrage at not being informed at the time , Schmidbauer said the Germans suspected that unnamed , high-ranking Russians were involved and didn ' t want to tip them off . &quot; The way this conflict is developing is dangerous and un-constructive , &quot; said Vladimir M . Kuznetsov , a former member of Yeltsin ' s nuclear regulatory_agency . &quot; Our nuclear safety system is virtually nonexistent , full of holes that cannot be patched without open , honest cooperation from the West. &quot; Likewise , European scientists involved in the complex lab work of tracing the four smuggled batches cannot learn for_sure where they originated and who stole them without active cooperation by Russian authorities . So far , the scientists ' best guess is that at least two shipments -- the plutonium-239 seized in Munich and a six-gram batch taken from the garage of a German salesman -- came not from nuclear_warheads but from Russian enrichment or reprocessing facilities . What is not clear is whether the thieves breached military or civilian security in Russia and who the intended buyers were . In any case , German authorities said the larger plutonium batch was of sufficient purity and about 1 / 20th the quantity required to build a nuclear bomb . But while Kohl stressed the urgency of Russian action against smugglers , the Clinton_Administration cautioned against jumping to conclusions about incomplete evidence . After Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher met Friday in Brussels with his British , French and German counterparts , a British spokesman said they reached a consensus to avoid a confrontation that might stiffen resistance to Yeltsin in the Russian bureaucracy . &quot; All that can be done now is moral suasion . . . telling Yeltsin , ' This is your business , ' &quot; said Heinrich Vogel , a political_scientist and Russian specialist in Cologne , Germany , who warned that too_much pressure would invite &quot; a conditioned reflex of keeping_out the West. &quot; The Russian army , Atomic Energy Ministry and counterintelligence service are already suspicious of a multimillion-dollar U.S. program to assist them . The money would help store plutonium from warheads dismantled under disarmament treaties and help count bomb-making material scattered in research institutes , weapons labs , civilian power_plants and nuclear waste dumps . One objection is that U.S. inspectors would be present at Russian storage facilities , another that American companies would get most of the contracts to build them . As a result , the program is moving slowly . The regulatory_agency set_up by Yeltsin has also been trying to impose order over the nuclear stockpile , which since the Soviet_Union broke_up nearly three years ago is no longer managed or guarded by a single authority . One Russian official said there had been no comprehensive inspection of the stockpile in at least 10 years . &quot; The Russian authorities can be made aware of the enormity of the problem , &quot; said Uwe Nerlich , deputy director of Munich ' s Ebenhausen Institute . &quot; Kohl and Yeltsin will talk , and Clinton and Yeltsin will talk . That will be a first_step . The question is what they can do even with the best of intentions. &quot; Boudreaux reported from Moscow and Miller from Bonn . Times staff writer Tyler Marshall in Brussels and Sergei Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
