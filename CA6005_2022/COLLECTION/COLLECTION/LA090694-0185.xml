   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN : OIL ROYALTIES COULD PROVE MIXED BLESSING ; RESOURCES : OFFICIALS COULD SEEK TO MAKE PROPERTY_OWNERS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE FUNDS HELP PAY FOR CLEANUP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most people don ' t have the good_fortune to collect regular checks from their neighbors . There are property_owners in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County , however , who get regular royalty checks for oil and gas_wells drilled by neighbors . In Pacoima , for example , about 3 # 900 property_owners are mailed checks by Medallion California Properties Co . From a small plot of land on Paxton Street , Medallion pumps oil and gas found under nearby homes and businesses . Although none of the nearby residents has leased the ground 500 feet below their homes , the Pacoima oil field has generated additional income for the locals for 20 years . But the Pacoima pumping operation doesn ' t really affect property values , said Ed Koenig , office manager of Park Regency Inc. , a real_estate brokerage in San Fernando . As the oil_wells have dried_up , the royalty checks have become smaller and less frequent , he said . And because the pumping operation is camouflaged , it hasn ' t depreciated nearby property values . Checks received by the Pacoima property_owners , and others who lease their oil and gas rights , vary depending_on the size of their property , the amount of oil and gas being pumped , the terms of the lease , and the current price of oil . Royalties from a typical homeowner can range from a_few dollars a month to $ 100 or more . In Pacoima , current oil_production is at 30 barrels a day -- way down from the 1 # 000 barrel-a-day production in 1986 -- as the wells are beginning to run_dry . While there are no new oil or gas_wells being drilled_in north Los Angeles County or Ventura County , there are 1 # 750 currently pumping wells in Ventura County and another 400 in the San Fernando Valley , reported Pat Kinnear , district deputy of the California Department of Conservation , Division of Oil , Gas and Geothermal Resources in Ventura . Drilling units , Kinnear explained , are the tall , metal-framed towers used by oil_companies to drill thousands of feet under ground . Once the drilling is complete , the towers are generally dismantled and replaced with more simple and compact pumping machinery . When an oil_company drills on its own property , there is no need to reimburse neighbors for any oil extracted from neighboring land . This so-called right of capture assumes , however , that none of the drilling actually invades the land underneath adjoining parcels . Because most oil drills don ' t just go straight down , a company that drills for oil has to get permission from the owners of any adjacent properties that might be invaded underground by drilling . Oil_companies get this type of permission by signing leases with properties as far away as one mile from a drilling site . In Pacoima , for example , the original drilling extended 7 # 200 feet vertically , and more_than 3 # 000 feet horizontally -- under acres of nearby parcels . Oil and gas_companies often strike long-term leases with owners of undeveloped properties , explained Robert L . Compton , an oil and gas attorney with law_firm Nordman , Cormany , Hair &amp; Compton in Oxnard . In some cases the leases were signed by large ranch owners before subdivision . Once an area is filled with homes and businesses , an oil_company generally goes door-to-door to offer property_owners royalties in exchange for the rights to so-called directional , or slant drill deep underground , Compton said . Some leases are renewable every 10 years , other leases are perpetual and last as long as there is oil being pumped out of the ground . It is almost impossible for oil_companies to get consent from all_the property_owners adjacent to an urban drilling site , Compton noted . He says that according to state law , when 75 % of nearby property_owners agree to sign oil and gas leases , the other 25 % can be forced to go_along with the majority . None of these leases allows an oil_company surface rights on any of the property -- only the deep subsurface rights . Most property_owners are more_than happy to collect a royalty in exchange for doing basically nothing , but there are some people who aren ' t keen on oil_production in their neighborhood . They are concerned about unsightliness or worry about safety . However , James R . Weddle , an agent for Medallion California Properties Co . which operates the Pacoima field , said , &quot; Unless you were up close , you would n ' t even know it ' s an oil field. &quot; The field is actually 10 wells surrounded by a Spanish-style structure and topped with a bell-style tower that was built to camouflage the original oil derrick . The oil_pumped from the ground leaves the site through an underground pipeline . Weddle also said the oil field is no threat to nearby residents . &quot; There are a lot of safety features : fire sensors , subsurface safety_valves that shut_off automatically when there is an earthquake , and security to prevent anyone getting_in and tampering with the wells. &quot; Also , there is nothing toxic at the site , he said . When the oil_pumping ceases in about five years , the holes will be plugged and the property can be redeveloped . Not all oil fields are free_of toxic chemicals , however . Many abandoned oil fields are now the subject of extensive litigation as federal , state and local officials try to figure_out how to get someone to pay the cleanup bill . One troubling possibility is that officials could turn_to nearby property_owners , said Donald Nanney , partner at Gilchrist &amp; Rutter , a law_firm in Santa Monica . Nanney researched this issue for a banking client that owned properties in which oil and gas royalties were being paid . He concluded that it may be possible to hold the recipients of royalties responsible_for cleaning_up the mess left_behind by pumping operations . &quot; It depends_on whether the owner of the royalty interest has an ownership interest in the contaminated real_property , &quot; said Nanney . An old California Supreme Court case says that if the right to receive a royalty from a certain property is perpetual , &quot; there is a risk that the owner of the perpetual interest would be deemed as owner of the property. &quot; If that happens , an owner could have an obligation to abate a nuisance such_as a polluted site . While there hasn ' t ever been a case on this particular issue , Nanney said , the liability of royalty holders remains a possibility . Property_owners who agree to lease their oil and gas rights might want to consider executing a lease for a certain period of years that can be renewed -- instead of a perpetual lease , Nanney said . Property_owners can do other things to protect their rights with oil and gas leases , said attorney Compton . Property_owners should know their share of any oil and gas produced by a nearby field . Owners should also review the oil and gas lease to see what rights are outlined in the lease . Finally , if you think you are not getting paid your fair share of royalties , you can check productions on file with the state Division of Oil , Gas and Geothermal Resources ( 805 ) 654-4761 , or demand an accounting of operations from the oil_company .</TEXT>
