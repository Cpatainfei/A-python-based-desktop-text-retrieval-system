   <HEADLINE> ON THE ISSUE : INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY ' S TOPICS ; COMMITTED TO FIGHTING WAR ON DRUGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent study released by the Sentencing Project , a nonprofit organization monitoring the nation ' s crime trends , stated that 61 % of federal inmates and 25 % of all California state prisoners were convicted on drug-related charges . In 1983 , the percentages were 27 % and 7 % , respectively . Some say that such dramatic increases can be linked to a series of new laws passed_by Congress and state_governments in the 1980s that called_for stiff mandatory minimum prison_terms for people convicted of selling or possessing narcotics . In connection with the study , the U.S. Bureau of Prisons predicted that by 1997 , 70 % of its inmates will be serving time for crimes involving drugs . Are we winning the war on drugs ? Clark Carr , executive_director of Narconon Professional Detox Center &quot; My perception is that somewhere between 70 % and 90 % of criminals are arrested or in jail as a result of their being high on some kind of drug . Many of our clients have had to support their habits through various kinds of immoral activities . They are walking up the ladder of criminality to support an increasingly expensive habit . I ' d like to know what ( the study ) determines as a cutoff point in something being drug-related . &quot; As far as the statistics tripling proportionately is concerned , I believe that ( the study ) is accurate . . . . The war is not lost , but we are still in the middle of it . The whole question , though , is oversimplified . The proper question should be : ' What do we have to spend , in terms of money , manpower and sheer willingness on the part of average citizens to win this war ? ' Because we cannot afford to lose_it . I cannot even entertain the notion that we ' re losing the war . That would lead to the degradation of our society . I just hope that the average decent citizen has the moral fiber to not turn_away from this problem. &quot; Virginia Postrel , editor of Reason Magazine &quot; The war on drugs has lost its meaning compared to where we were in the early ' 80s . People are put_in prisons for nonviolent offenses , while the public worries more about violent crimes . We realize that filling the prisons with drug offenders is no longer such a major priority . We ought to worry more about protecting those people from themselves and protecting the public from violent acts . &quot; We must distinguish between substance-related crimes and crimes that stem from the prohibition on drugs . The prohibition makes drugs relatively expensive and difficult to obtain . Consequently , there are those who commit petty crimes to feed a drug habit and those who commit violent crimes because they deal in the black_market . When you go without a legal market for most drugs , you ( operate ) without the legalities incorporated by the established industries . . . . &quot; A small percentage of violent crimes occurring can be considered to be substance-related ( versus prohibition-related ) . Currently , in_order to get_at the tiny percentage of people who are violent as a result of drug use , you put_away thousands who may have gone their whole lives without committing a violent crime. &quot; Dennis Zeuner , Los Angeles Police_Department narcotics detective &quot; The problem we have is that no one is even waging a real battle against drugs . I have ( fewer ) people working for me now than I did three years ago . If it were a war , I would have more resources . Smoking cocaine has impacted the drug problem severely . It has put people who would n ' t have been dependent_on drugs 10 years ago into that category . Once people started smoking cocaine , they couldn ' t assimilate its being considered a recreational drug with the fact that they needed to have it on a constant basis . &quot; There are crimes with drugs involved that are not reported as drug-related because of their violent nature . People are involved in homicides that occur within a drug atmosphere . The percentage could go as high as 50 % easily if those crimes were included . ( In relation_to winning the war on drugs ) , we ' ve made some progress over the last five to seven years . But it ' s like putting your finger in a ( crumbling ) dike , only to see the problem resurface somewhere else. &quot;</TEXT>
