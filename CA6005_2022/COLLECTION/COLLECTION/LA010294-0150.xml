AFTER A DIFFICULT YEAR IN COURT AND ON THE SCREEN , SHE TRIES TO REBUILD A STALLED CAREER AND EMBARKS_ON A NEW MARRIAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one could be happier to kiss ' 93 goodby than Kim Basinger . Last year at this time , the actress was facing a multimillion-dollar civil suit over a role that changed her life forever . Ironically , it was a role she never performed . As the new year rolls in , Basinger finds herself focusing_on her new marriage to Alec Baldwin , thinking_of starting a family and rebuilding her shattered career -- all_in the midst of wiping_out everything she owns . &quot; I feel as though I have been through a crash course in life , &quot; Basinger says . &quot; It ' s been an incredible ride . I ' ve had the highs of meeting my soul_mate , but the lows of having my life ripped apart for something I didn ' t do . I would n ' t change the knowledge I ' ve gained for anything . Just don ' t ever ask me to repeat it. &quot; Basinger ' s crash course in the school of hard knocks came_to a head last spring . In May , 1991 , she had decided to pass_on playing the lead role in a small Jennifer Lynch film about a woman whose arms and legs are cut_off by a doctor obsessed with her . Basinger had considered taking the role in &quot; Boxing Helena , &quot; but reconsidered on the advice of her agent because of the dicey subject_matter . The film ' s producers then sued her for breach of oral_contract . On March 24 , 1993 , a jury in Los Angeles Superior_Court told Basinger to pay the producers $ 8.9 million in damages . ( The judge later reduced the award to $ 7.4 million , but with attorneys fees added , it currently stands at $ 8.1 million. ) The film , with Sherilyn Fenn in_the_lead role , was ultimately released in September and bombed badly at the box_office . Stunned and , she says , with no way to make such a payment , Basinger filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 24 , which her lawyers converted to a Chapter 7 just last Monday . The change now means that her estate will be subject_to immediate liquidation and distributed to creditors . Now , at 40 , she finds herself grappling with uncertain finances and a very bruised reputation . &quot; What has been done to this woman is so unfair , I can ' t even find the right words to describe it , &quot; says Baldwin , who has been Basinger ' s companion for several years and married her last summer . &quot; After what I watched her go_through in that courtroom day after day , I believe there is no justice for people like her in this country . These people are trying to destroy her. &quot; Baldwin remains undaunted in his devotion to his wife , boosting her morale daily and helping her rebuild her career , even as his own career flourishes . &quot; I will not stop until she gets her fair shake , &quot; he says . It was Baldwin who planned and prepared their beachfront wedding in East Hampton , right down to the surprise fireworks and the white baby_roses in her tiara . &quot; Alec and I want lots of kids everywhere -- a big family , &quot; Basinger says . &quot; I never want to give_up my work , don ' t get me wrong . But he is my life ' s focus . After all_of this , sometimes I think there would be no Kim Basinger without Alec . Some days , during this insane ordeal , I would look_at him and ask , ' Who is Kim Basinger ? ' &quot; * There is a crisp December breeze blowing as Basinger strolls through her Woodland Hills back yard to a place she calls sanctuary , Shih Tzu puppies nipping at her heels . The small structure holds two sun-filled rooms : downstairs a gym and upstairs an entertainment area with a white piano , a TV and stereo_system atop a cinder block-and-board shelf ( the kind most students have in college ) and the chaise_longue keepsake from the set of &quot; The Marrying Man , &quot; the 1991 Disney film where Basinger met Baldwin . Clad in a white T-shirt and baggy overalls and sitting cross-legged on the lavender carpet , Basinger settles_down to her first lengthy interview since last year ' s monumental events , her voice rising as her tale unfolds . It ' s a tale of a verdict that shocked much of Hollywood and includes , she and her lawyers say , some questionable actions on the part of the judge and clerk in the case . It ' s a tale of facing bankruptcy after being one of Hollywood ' s most visible and successful actresses -- a bankruptcy that her creditors have tried to use to prevent her from becoming pregnant ( a pregnancy , they say , would interfere with her ability to work for at least several months ; that in turn would affect income that would ultimately go_to them ) . One bright spot : After a gap of several months since her last movie , Basinger ' s career is showing signs of life . Branded the co-stars from hell during the filming of &quot; The Marrying Man &quot; -- a set allegedly disrupted by tantrums , broken and hurled equipment , fights with the crew , producer and director , and cellular_phones being ripped_out of studio executives ' hands by the stars in fits of pique -- she and Baldwin are back on screen in Roger Donaldson ' s action-packed remake of &quot; The Getaway &quot; for Largo Entertainment , due Feb . 11 . It couldn ' t come at a better time . * &quot; You know , after all_of this , I ' ve become sick_of the sound of my own name , &quot; Basinger says , referring to the seemingly endless publicity surrounding last spring ' s &quot; Boxing Helena &quot; trial . The saga actually began in January , 1991 , when Jennifer Lynch , daughter of director David Lynch , walked into Basinger ' s production office off Coldwater Canyon Road with what Basinger thought might be an interesting , albeit twisted , script . It was the first of what would be three fateful meetings with Lynch . &quot; When I read it , I looked_at the imagination , &quot; Basinger says . &quot; I remember thinking , ' Was this story somebody ' s bad dream ? ' Like most actors , I always look_for new writers with different material and I thought this was another woman trying to make_it in this town . ' Give her a chance ' ( I thought ) . She seemed to know what she wanted . It was refreshing to see her enthusiasm . &quot; But everything went sour after that. &quot; Basinger insists she never committed verbally to playing Helena , the woman who is dismembered , and ultimately backed_out on the advice of her ICM agent , Guy McElwaine . Lynch and Main_Line Pictures producer Carl Mazzocone contend she did commit . Basinger says she never even met Mazzocone -- who pre-sold the movie to overseas distributors based on her anticipated involvement -- until her pretrial deposition . Mazzocone actually negotiated with Basinger ' s lawyer , Julie Philips of Bloom , Dekom , Hergott and Cook . &quot; What I want to make clear is that this was no handshake deal or some agreement scrawled on a cocktail napkin , &quot; Mazzocone says . &quot; On Feb . 27 , 1991 , all deal points were reached and memorialized on a deal memo . After the deal memo , we started to exchange long-form acting service agreements . After seven drafts of long-form agreements , we reached the execution copies . Her agents and lawyers were authorized to act_on her behalf . &quot; What I stood_up for is the ' deal memo. ' That is what this town operates on. &quot; But Basinger insists that her agents and lawyers were not authorized to sign_off on any project , only to negotiate on her behalf . She never signed any deal memo , which is basically considered a working document in_progress between a producer and talent . While &quot; Helena &quot; was Mazzocone ' s first feature to produce , it wasn ' t his first round with a star on deal memos or on deal memos with &quot; Helena , &quot; for that matter . Madonna preceded Basinger , with discussions falling_apart in December , 1990 , one month before Basinger was approached . In fact , Madonna had been further along in the process . &quot; Madonna left these people in wardrobe fittings ! When I met Jennifer for the first time , I didn ' t know who was walking into my office that afternoon , &quot; Basinger says . &quot; I didn ' t know a woman ( Jennifer ) and a man ( Mazzocone ) had just been essentially fired by somebody else . . . that they were coming from such desperation. &quot; But Mazzocone didn ' t sue Madonna . The difference ? &quot; Madonna solicited us , &quot; Mazzocone says . &quot; We relied_on her because she wanted the part and then she bailed , &quot; four weeks before shooting . &quot; We didn ' t sue her because we found Kim. &quot; Because Basinger was a bigger film_star overseas , her casting meant more money upfront from foreign distributors . &quot; Not that I would wish this on Madonna or anyone , &quot; says Basinger , but she stills feels_like a scapegoat . &quot; The point is this whole_thing is absurd , especially when you consider I never even met Mazzocone , never even talked to him until the deposition. &quot; Philips , Basinger ' s attorney , says : &quot; I knew there was no agreement ( then ) , just as I sit here today . Main_Line , like any small independent producer trying to raise money , wasn ' t in any position to commit $ 600 # 000 to Kim Basinger , &quot; her salary on the film . &quot; The irony of this whole nightmare is that as the negotiations dragged_on , I remember being concerned that Main_Line would throw_in_the_towel and Kim might be disappointed. &quot; Mazzocone , 34 , who says he ' s been in the business 12 years , meanwhile feels vindicated for taking_on a big star and the Hollywood infrastructure -- and winning . &quot; I beat those people , &quot; he says . &quot; I think the catalyst in this whole_thing was ( ICM ' s Guy ) McElwaine , the big_shot , grandfatherly agent who thought I was just some moth he could flick off his shoulder. &quot; But Mazzocone proved too big a moth . &quot; He underestimated his opponent . McElwaine sank this ship and he got_off the hook , because under the law_agents are bulletproof in these deals. &quot; ICM was eventually dismissed as a co-conspirator in the case . Basinger is now represented by another ICM agent , Andrea Eastman . &quot; These people were wanna-bes , &quot; Basinger says . &quot; They needed someone to go_after and it ended_up being me . I just can ' t believe I ' m caught_up in the middle of this . It has made me a nervous wreck . I don ' t see myself as some victim or martyr -- I hate those words , they ' re so pathetic . People ask me , ' Why didn ' t you settle ? Pay them $ 600 # 000 and get_rid_of them. ' At no time did_it ever cross my mind to settle . This town is all about settling . I didn ' t do anything wrong . Never , ever will I settle. &quot; * How Kim Basinger ultimately fares in the legal_system remains to be seen , as her case is far from over . Lawyer Irving H . Greines is already shaping her appeal , which will probably not be resolved until sometime next year . In a 38-page appellate motion for a new trial filed a month after the verdict , Basinger ' s lawyers attack the jury ' s damages as excessive ; cite prejudicial error on the part of Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge Judith C . Chirlin , who presided over the case , and her refusal to instruct the jury properly ; allege failure by the judge to advise the jury of ICM ' s dismissal as a co-conspirator in the case , and point to what they say is insufficient evidence to determine that an oral agreement existed . &quot; As an appellate lawyer I see the disasters . But in the 26 years that I have been practicing appellate law , this case ranks at or near the top , &quot; Greines says . &quot; This one is an appellate dream case because some of the errors are of the most elemental type. &quot; First of all , Basinger ' s team believes the jury ' s verdict demanding Basinger to pay Main_Line a massive damage award based on gross_revenues , not net_profits , was excessive and against the law . They say the jury ignored the court ' s instruction to award net_profits -- which would have fallen between $ 895 # 000 and $ 1.1 million -- and went_for the higher gross amount . Secondly , her lawyers say the jury had insufficient evidence to conclude that an oral agreement existed . Not directly considered was the Screen Actors Guild rule demanding that a written contract -- not oral -- exist for a producer ( in this case , Mazzocone ) to require a star ( Basinger ) to perform nude , as dictated in the script of &quot; Helena. &quot; An oral agreement cannot supersede the SAG nudity rule . Basinger ' s lawyers say Chirlin never instructed the jury about the SAG rule . On this subject , at least , they seem to have a point . Juror Chawn Sanders says : &quot; The SAG rule never came_up when we were in ( verdict ) discussions . It ' s kind of funny because they were talking_about the nudity issue during the majority of the trial . Now that I think_about it , ( consideration of the SAG rule ) probably would have affected the outcome. &quot; Basinger ' s lawyers also contend in the appellate motion Judge Chirlin erred in failing to inform the jury that ICM had been dropped from the case or to instruct them on Madonna ' s aborted involvement ; refusing to allow Basinger ' s attorneys to provide evidence regarding the industry ' s customary practices to a jury unfamiliar_with such , and , dropping the critical words &quot; and agreed upon &quot; in telling the jury that preliminary negotiations may result in a binding contract when material terms are understood . &quot; This judge gave jury instructions that were absolutely wrong on the law , &quot; Greines says . For her part , Judge Chirlin says her instructions were performed properly . And , she adds , &quot; The fact of the_matter is that throughout the trial , a significant portion of my rulings were in favor of Kim. &quot; While Basinger ' s appeal will be fought on points of law and evidence in the case , allegations of Chirlin ' s other missteps can play no part in appellate strategy . But Basinger and her attorneys believe Chirlin ' s behavior had a subliminal , if not direct , effect on the minds of the jurors and their verdict . Specifically , they say other court clerks held a baby shower for the judge ' s clerk Syndy Scaife-Richard in the courtroom next door during a noon break_in the trial . Both Basinger and Baldwin , inexplicably , had been invited to the shower by Scaife-Richard , and Basinger says she felt compelled to attend , under the peculiar circumstances . She spent part of the time at the party signing autographs and chatting it up with the judge , and some of the judge ' s employees and relatives . &quot; They were all very nice , but I felt very uncomfortable being there , &quot; Basinger says now . &quot; To be honest , I wasn ' t sure what to do . Nobody came from the ( plaintiff ' s ) side . We took pictures with the judge ' s mother . I felt_like I had signed_up for an episode of ' Night Court. ' What it turned_out to be was a kangaroo court. &quot; Trial_attorney Howard L . Weitzman put it another way . &quot; Look , this was very improper . Kim shouldn ' t have been invited because it made her feel she had to show . This woman was a defendant in a case , on_trial for her financial life . She shouldn ' t have been put_in that position . Imagine the implication if Kim hadn ' t gone : ' Check_out the pretty star snubbing us. ' &quot; Chirlin says that ' s not the case . &quot; My staff is very friendly and they asked Kim to the shower . I had no idea she would be there . You have to understand the courtroom is the workplace for these employees and they held a shower there , just as any office would for a co-worker. &quot; Then , after the verdict was announced , Weitzman says , Chirlin hugged Lynch and Mazzocone in the courtroom for all to see . &quot; I ' ve never , ever seen a judge come_out and hug parties after a verdict , &quot; Weitzman says . &quot; Most judges at least try to maintain an appearance of objectivity. &quot; Counters Chirlin : &quot; I don ' t remember being embraced , but it is not something I would initiate . I do remember them ( Lynch and Mazzocone ) being ecstatically happy. &quot; Chirlin does recall Lynch and Mazzocone hugging members of the jury . &quot; I would have hugged a tree , anything , anybody . I just made nearly $ 10 million , &quot; Mazzocone says . &quot; I remember after the trial , Jennifer and Mr. Mazzocone told us ( the jurors ) they were inviting us to the premiere , &quot; juror Sanders says . &quot; I remember walking_out_of the courtroom thinking , ' that ' s strange . How can they have a premiere , when they kept saying during the whole trial they didn ' t have enough money to finish the movie ? ' We had been under the impression they couldn ' t get_it sold and now they were having a premiere ? Oh , well -- I didn ' t go. &quot; But Chirlin did attend the premiere . Her attendance also sticks_in Weitzman ' s craw . &quot; I did go_to the premiere and in retrospect I probably shouldn ' t have gone , if they perceive it as a problem with my fairness , &quot; Chirlin says . &quot; But by the time of the premiere , the trial was over. &quot; The appeal , she adds , was not weighing_on her mind . * On Aug . 19 , the day Basinger married Baldwin , a strange letter was being written to the star . A week or so later , it turned_up at Basinger ' s office . She didn ' t know what to think ; her attorney Julie Philips had the same reaction . &quot; I think Julie fell on the floor when I read it to her . She couldn ' t believe her ears . I still can ' t. &quot; Sent by clerk Scaife-Richard , the letter read , &quot; Dear Kim : I have a really big favor to ask of Alec , but out of respect for you and your relationship with him , I thought it would be better to convey my request through you . Besides , soon you will be Mrs . Baldwin anyway . Right ? ? ? ( smile ) &quot; Initially , I thought_of you first , but I would not want to place you in a compromising position and add_to your legal problems in light of your bankruptcy filing . I don ' t know if you should be flattered that I thought_of you first or relieved that I decided to ask Alec instead . ( smile ) &quot; Scaife-Richard goes_on to talk_about a family friend , an unnamed professional_basketball player , and his wife who promised to loan her $ 125 # 000 to buy a house . But then the couple decided to divorce and rescinded their offer . &quot; You and Alec are the only other individuals I know who might have and be willing to loan this large amount_of_money , &quot; she wrote . &quot; Having had the opportunity to meet you both in_person , I know that you are ' down to earth ' and hopefully have a sympathetic ear , &quot; Scaife-Richard continued . &quot; Hopefully , I have not tarnished your opinion of me by making this request . It was very hard for me to set_aside my pride and write this letter . I have great respect for you both and will respect your decision whatever it may be . All transactions shall be CONFIDENTIAL. &quot; Then she spelled_out the terms : The clerk would issue Baldwin and Basinger a promissory_note of $ 131 # 250 ( $ 125 # 000 principle plus 5 % interest ) to be paid in full over 22 years at $ 497.15 a month . The postscript was a picture of the clerk and her three children , including the baby she had been carrying during Basinger ' s trial . Asked by The Times why she didn ' t consider a bank loan , an embarrassed Scaife-Richard -- who is still clerking for Chirlin -- said the interest was too high . Chirlin had no part in the letter . In fact , she was shocked when Philips wrote her about it on Oct . 19 , following a second missive from the clerk ( dated Oct . 4 ) detailing her intended use of the loaned funds . That letter , Philips says , followed numerous calls to Basinger ' s office . Chirlin ' s words in a letter to Philips were &quot; stunned and appalled &quot; and have been duly noted in the Basinger file . She said the clerk would be admonished . She was . * &quot; I hate the lawyers , &quot; Mazzocone rants . &quot; I hate the system . Who knew I was dealing with a Kamikaze case ? &quot; Mazzocone is miffed that Basinger converted her Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization , filed May 24 , into a Chapter 7 liquidation last week . She converted primarily because Mazzocone and his lawyers had insisted on a third_party being brought_in to determine what movie roles she would take . In other words , instead of stalling payment to Mazzocone and her other creditors -- under a Chapter 11 reorganization , there are more options in how assets can be distributed to creditors , over a more flexible time_period -- she now faces one-time liquidation of the assets she has right now , which then would be distributed to creditors , ending the process . Her bankruptcy lawyer , Leslie Cohen , says Basinger had had enough . &quot; It became apparent there was no plan she could provide that would satisfy them , &quot; Cohen says . &quot; They just had to keep hounding her . They wanted a third_party to exercise control over her decisions over whether or not to accept work , which movies to make . that ' s involuntary servitude . They wanted her to reveal her plans about having a baby . that ' s against her constitutional rights -- it was ridiculous . It was the last straw. &quot; Basinger still bristles_at the demands , pacing as she talks . &quot; Just imagine them saying that to a man -- telling him he couldn ' t have a family . They wanted to know if I planned to take_out a life_insurance policy . What does that mean ? What do these people want from me -- my arms , my heart , my soul ? What ? This goes beyond any civilized demands . . . any human decency. &quot; &quot; Even though our ( Chapter 11 ) plan provided much more_than the law required and much more_than Main_Line would have gotten_in a Chapter 7 , nothing was good_enough for them , &quot; Cohen says . &quot; Kim would have escrowed three years of earnings and all_of her assets until the appeal was resolved under an 11 . She would have kept $ 10 # 000 a month to live_on , plus the $ 9 # 000 a month she has to pay in alimony ( to her first husband , Ron Britton ) . &quot; Now her assets will be liquidated by a court trustee and they ' ll have to take what they get_in the pecking order of creditors . It shouldn ' t have come_to this , but Kim had no choice. &quot; Bankruptcy documents show Basinger , who can command a $ 3-million salary on some films , had net earnings of $ 7.9 million for 1988 through 1992 . She projects her net_income this year to be $ 846 # 429 , which includes income from the upcoming &quot; The Getaway , &quot; proceeds from a bit_part as Garth ' s girlfriend in the current &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; and a fee from an appearance in a Spanish commercial for the champagne Freixenet . Basinger has asked the bankruptcy court to consider several factors beyond her control : That her films , except for &quot; Batman , &quot; have not performed well at the box_office ; that actresses over 40 are offered fewer roles , and that the &quot; relentless &quot; trial coverage has damaged her reputation with potential employers . Mazzocone counters that Basinger could get plenty of work . He sees her Chapter 7 conversion as completely self-destructive . &quot; I just want my money , what she owes me . This is their grand way of stalling. &quot; After a court-appointed trustee liquidates Basinger ' s assets under the Chapter 7 , any money due Mazzocone would be put into an escrow account until the appeal is resolved . Mazzocone and his lawyers have accused Basinger in court documents regarding her bankruptcy of hiding assets , saying their value was closer to $ 5 million and up than the $ 3 million she has claimed . They ' ve challenged the 5 % interest she says she has had in a partnership since 1989 , which bought the town of Braselton , Ga . They believe she has squirreled away valuable antiques and probably holds more property interests than she ' s letting_on . That includes her Coldwater Canyon production company , Porch Swing Productions . &quot; Look_around . This is what I have , &quot; Basinger says . &quot; This &quot; is a modest tract home -- at least by movie-star standards -- that she paid $ 150 # 000 for 14 years ago that her appraiser now values at $ 600 # 000 . It has three smallish bedrooms . A row of chipped-paint Georgia rockers in varying sizes are lined_up in front of her living room fireplace . A white couch and matching chaise that look as if they came from Stylus are in the den . Special touches include a stained-glass_window at the entry way , a room-separating bar that has been turned_into an aquarium , a carousel horse and a long pine table covered with vanilla candles . There ' s a fenced-in pool in the back yard where she and Alec take evening swims . And of course , there ' s her sanctuary . * &quot; In some ways , I ' m more famous for the things that I haven ' t done than for what I have done , &quot; muses Basinger . Perhaps . As a shy girl in Athens , Ga. , young Kim would while_away the hours with a girlfriend , dreaming of becoming an actress and having her friend be her &quot; dresser. &quot; As a teen-ager she became Athens ' Junior Miss beauty queen . At age 16 headed for New York to become a Breck girl and eventually a model . The camera loved her blond mane and sensuous features , a product of Swedish , German and Cherokee bloodlines . Her dream of acting started to unfold in 1979 with the TV movie &quot; Katie : Portrait of a Centerfold , &quot; with Basinger playing the centerfold , and then the 1980 NBC miniseries &quot; From Here to Eternity. &quot; Her motion_picture debut happened in late 1980 , opposite Jan-Michael Vincent , in &quot; Hard Country. &quot; The next year , Basinger co-starred with Charlton Heston in &quot; Mother Lode. &quot; Her breakthrough was playing Domino in the 1983 James Bond film &quot; Never Say Never Again. &quot; That same year she starred for Blake Edwards in &quot; The Man Who Loved Women &quot; and played a femme_fatale -- Robert Redford ' s mistress -- in Barry Levinson ' s &quot; The Natural. &quot; Then her career careened off into more controversial parts : Adrian Lyne ' s &quot; 9 1 / 2 Weeks &quot; -- what Basinger considers her toughest role to date -- and &quot; Fool for Love , &quot; with Sam Shepard . A few other forgettable roles preceded what would be her biggest part to date : that of reporter Vicki Vale in Warner Bros. ' 1989 blockbuster &quot; Batman. &quot; Her favorite role , though , was the lead in Robert Benton ' s 1987 quirky romantic comedy &quot; Nadine &quot; -- &quot; the most beautifully written role I ' ve read , &quot; Basinger says . She has also played more_than her share of truly ridiculous parts in such films as &quot; My Stepmother Is an Alien &quot; and the animated feature &quot; Cool World. &quot; The turning point in her career -- and life -- was 1991 ' s &quot; The Marrying Man. &quot; Basinger had just ended an unhappy eight-year marriage to Britton , her makeup artist . She describes her wild fling with pop star Prince that followed as a &quot; pit stop , post divorce. &quot; In fact , she was in Minnesota with Prince when she first talked to Baldwin , who rang to ask her about co-starring in &quot; The Marrying Man. &quot; Many phone conversations followed . Finally they met on the set . They went_to dinner at Morton ' s the first night to discuss the film . They came_in two cars . They left in one . &quot; He actually had car trouble . We came_back to the house . We were talking , up here &quot; in the sanctuary . &quot; He kissed me and then asked me if I wanted kids . That was the beginning , &quot; says Basinger . It was also the beginning of what some cast and crew on the set called a journey into bedlam . Reports began to surface that Basinger and Baldwin pulled outrageous shenanigans , cursing at the producer and director , hurling chairs in the air , grabbing phones out of Disney executives ' hands . Producer David Permutt , who had worked with Basinger on &quot; Blind_Date , &quot; had some of the biggest rows with the stars . While 1987 ' s &quot; Blind Date &quot; had been a positive experience with Basinger , Permutt says he ' d &quot; never ever &quot; work with Basinger or Baldwin again . Disney Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg also grumbled at the time about the pair and his difficulties working with them . The feelings are mutual , say Basinger and Baldwin . In fact , both say the accounts were blown_out of proportion . They also say they were promised things by Disney that never happened . They write it off as an unpleasant experience that had a great ending . &quot; That film was a media mad-dog frenzy , &quot; says Basinger . &quot; I can say that a lot of that stuff wasn ' t true , but what ' s the point ? It ' s over . Do people treat me different after ' The Marrying Man ' ? Some do . &quot; One thing I learned from that experience was how to stand_up for myself , which was hard for me in the past . I look_back and have to thank Disney and Jeffrey Katzenberg , &quot; she adds . &quot; If it had not been for Jeffrey I would n ' t have met Alec or had a chance to sing . I always wanted to sing. &quot; Several films followed , including &quot; Final Analysis &quot; and last fall ' s &quot; The Real McCoy. &quot; The latter was another box-office disappointment . &quot; This film was originally a love_story that turned_into a caper movie , &quot; she says . &quot; I blame myself in part for this . I fought to get Val Kilmer in the movie , but he just wasn ' t into it . It just fell apart. &quot; The film ' s producer , Martin Bregman , also grouses about Kilmer . &quot; He almost tried to destroy the picture . We had to rewrite it because of him , &quot; says Bregman . &quot; But Kim was terrific , a real pro . Never late , always very prepared , always very helpful and never an ounce of trouble . She was a classy , nice woman , who always brought cookies to the crew . &quot; With ' The Marrying Man ' they had a director who never made anything but an animated picture and didn ' t know how to handle stars . Stars need strong directors . I ' m working with Alec now on ' The Shadow ' and I would say the same about him . &quot; I have recommended Kim to other producers around town , &quot; says Bregman . &quot; And I would say unequivocally she is the most misunderstood talent in Hollywood. &quot; Producer Frank Mancuso Jr. , who worked with her on &quot; Cool World , &quot; and Chuck Roven , who produced &quot; Final Analysis , &quot; say the same . Producer Larry Gordon , who just wrapped &quot; The Getaway , &quot; says he got calls from colleagues asking about his experience working with the couple . &quot; Zero problems . I mean it -- zero . And this was a tough shoot , six days a week in the ( Arizona ) desert . Lots of action . But they were total pros and I love them both. &quot; * Testimonials aside , none of Basinger ' s films have been big moneymakers except &quot; Batman , &quot; as duly noted in her bankruptcy filing , though she and Baldwin have high hopes for the steamy , action-packed &quot; The Getaway. &quot; She passed_on &quot; T . Rex , &quot; about a cop who has a dinosaur as a partner , last year , which Whoopi Goldberg picked_up and then tried ( and failed ) to forfeit . &quot; You know what ' s funny : I ' ve become the example . When Whoopi tried to bail , they threatened to sue her and pointed to me as What Could Happen , &quot; says Basinger . &quot; Now think_about this . They can make her act in the movie , but how good of a performance will they get ? Will she promote the picture when they need her to ? Who can say ? But those things have to be weighed and the smart people in this town know that . &quot; What do you expect when you force people against their will ? In a way my trial was a movie , one that everybody watched. &quot; Basinger , for one , is still waiting for the final cut .</TEXT>
