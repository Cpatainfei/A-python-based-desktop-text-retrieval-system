   <HEADLINE> USAIR CREW DID NOT HEAR TOWER ' S WIND-SHEAR ALERT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The captain and first officer who survived the crash of a USAir flight told investigators on Tuesday that they tried to avoid storm pockets as they landed the plane and did not hear an on-board alarm warning of a dangerous wind shear . Capt . Michael R . Greenlee and First Officer James Hayes were &quot; cooperative and very helpful &quot; in separate interviews with National Transportation Safety Board investigators , said John Hammerschmidt , an NTSB board_member . Hammerschmidt related the pilots ' descriptions of the last few moments of Saturday ' s Flight 1016 from Columbia , S.C. The crash killed 37 of the 57 people on board . The pilots said they noticed a concentration of storms to the south and east of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport as they descended toward landing . &quot; They agreed they would turn right , which is west , to stay_away_from those cells , &quot; Hammerschmidt said . While still two miles from the airport , the DC-9 passed_through rain that quickly turned violent . The air traffic controller announced a wind-shear alert . The captain decided to abort the landing when the plane was just 200 feet off the runway , a maneuver called a &quot; go-around. &quot; &quot; The crew did a go-around . . . because of the heavy rain , a possible wet runway , the lack of visibility and the wind reports , &quot; Hammerschmidt said . The pilots said Hayes gave the engines maximum power , turned right and turned the nose up . The plane climbed to 350 feet , but the pilots &quot; felt a severe sink rate , &quot; which would be expected if they encountered a wind shear , Hammerschmidt said . Wind shear is a sudden shift in wind speed and direction due_to a rapid downward rush of cooled air . &quot; Neither pilot recalled hearing the on-board wind-shear alert activated. &quot; Hammerschmidt said . The tower warned the pilots of the possibility of a wind shear less than two minutes before the crash . Greenlee and Hayes were released from a hospital Monday . Fourteen people remained hospitalized .</TEXT>
