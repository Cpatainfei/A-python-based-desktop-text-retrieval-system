   <HEADLINE> CONGRESSIONAL NOTICE SOUGHT ON FED FOREIGN_EXCHANGE ACTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The chairman of the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee is accusing the Federal_Reserve_Board of meddling in U.S. foreign_policy by participating in a new trilateral commission designed to stabilize Mexico ' s currency . Rep . Henry B . Gonzalez ( D-Tex. ) , the Fed ' s fiercest critic in Congress , said the agency ' s participation in the new commission formed by the United States , Canada and Mexico raises troubling questions about the ability of an independent regulatory body to influence foreign_policy when it is subject_to little congressional supervision . In late April , the Fed agreed with the Treasury_Department to enter into a currency exchange accord with Mexico and Canada . The Fed and Treasury will spend $ 3 billion each to support the commission , which is an outgrowth of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . The currency exchange pact is intended to minimize fluctuations between the dollar and the peso , now that the U.S. and Mexican economies are about to become closely intertwined under NAFTA . Gonzalez said the swap amounts to a &quot; subsidy to Mexico &quot; and that the Fed is putting $ 3 billion of taxpayer money into the deal with no congressional oversight . Gonzalez said the currency arrangement will enable the Fed to help support the Mexican government in times of crisis , and thus will be able to influence foreign_policy without having to consult Congress . &quot; In truth , this is a loan of U.S. dollars to Mexico , &quot; Gonzalez said . Fed officials said the central_bank has been involved in similar international currency swaps since 1962 and that they have become routine business . In its foreign_exchange activities , the Fed influences currency rates by spending dollars to buy and sell other currencies . The actions are usually designed to reduce volatility in currency markets or reduce the impact on international financial_institutions from another country ' s currency problems . On Monday , Gonzalez introduced legislation that would force both the Fed and the Treasury_Department to make more thorough public disclosure of policies designed to influence international currency markets , &quot; interventions which sometimes mean putting billions of dollars of taxpayers ' money at stake , &quot; he said . Under the measure , the Fed chairman would be required to testify before Congress about exchange_rate policies and the Treasury_secretary would have to notify Congress within 24 hours of each time the Fed and Treasury intervened in foreign_exchange .</TEXT>
