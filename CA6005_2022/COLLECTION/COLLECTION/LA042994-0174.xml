   <HEADLINE> PROBLEMS FORCE EXTENSION OF S . AFRICA VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Massive distribution problems , ballot shortages , long lines of voters and allegations of sabotage in South_Africa ' s first democratic elections forced officials Thursday to extend voting for an extra day today in the Zulu heartland and five other rural regions . The decision , approved by President Frederik W . de Klerk and other political_leaders , came amid reports of wide problems , though no serious violence , at hundreds of the nearly 10 # 000 polling_stations . Millions of South_Africans turned_up to cast ballots Thursday , which was to be the final day of national voting . But election officials said ballot papers did not arrive_at numerous polling sites in six regions , especially in remote villages , until late Thursday afternoon , just hours before they were_due to close . &quot; We have strong evidence of substantial inadequacy in the voting &quot; in those regions , said Johann Kriegler , head of the country ' s Independent Electoral Commission . He placed most of the blame on the commission itself , which had been unable to get enough ballots to some areas . &quot; Because of ( our ) difficulties in provisioning these areas , the voters there have not had a fair and free opportunity to express their views , &quot; Kriegler said . The extension was welcomed by most political_parties , including the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party . It reflected the determination of political_leaders and the electoral commission to forestall challenges to the elections and remove doubts about whether the polling was free and fair . &quot; We must be able to say that all South_Africans who wish to vote , and were prepared to take the trouble to vote , were given the opportunity , &quot; said De Klerk , who issued the formal decree extending voting . &quot; If we don ' t achieve that , then the election result will , right from the beginning , be in total jeopardy . And it would be the beginning of conflict and strife. &quot; He said many South_Africans &quot; feel somewhat disillusioned because of irregularities that have occurred here and there. &quot; But he urged them to accept the extension . &quot; We ' ve got_to make this election work , &quot; he said . &quot; If we don ' t get a 100 % perfect election , let us strive to achieve 95 % and let us live with it. &quot; The Independent Election_Commission , which must eventually decide whether the elections have been free and fair , said it was satisfied that South_Africans who wanted to vote were able to cast ballots by the time polls closed Thursday in most parts of the country . Many polls , which experienced shortages of ballots or greater-than-expected numbers of voters , stayed open well past the 7 p.m. closing time . But the voting had been seriously disrupted by shortages of voting materials in remote regions of six former black homelands . As a result , the polls will reopen today at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. in the eastern region of KwaZulu , in Natal province ; in Transkei and Ciskei in the southeast , and in the region encompassing Lebowa , Gazankulu and Venda in the northern Transvaal . Election officials declined to say how many of the 21.7 million potential voters , about 18 million of whom are black , had voted when polls closed officially Thursday night . About 2 million potential voters live_in the areas where polls will reopen today . The extension of voting will mean a delay in the vote count , which is scheduled to begin Saturday and continue around-the-clock until a final result is available , probably on Sunday . At De Klerk ' s insistence , the votes cast today will be counted separately , in case of later questions about the polling . But even the extra day will not protect the election results from challenges , officials acknowledged . The election_commission said it had received hundreds of complaints of voting irregularities from every political_party . Some related to late arrival of ballots ; others concerned everything from allegations of biased conduct by_election officers to missing ballot_boxes . ANC President Nelson Mandela complained Thursday of &quot; massive sabotage &quot; at polling_stations . Although his aides said the president had spoken out of frustration , Jay Naidoo , an ANC official , said the party had lodged numerous complaints with the election_commission . Among other things , the ANC contends that in some areas of KwaZulu , police and other officials from Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s outgoing homeland administration were intimidating voters . Naidoo also claimed Inkatha supporters had created &quot; pirate polling stations. &quot; Inkatha ' s national political director , Ziba Jiyane , denied the charge and countered that the ANC was &quot; panicking because Inkatha is about to deliver a resounding victory. &quot; Inkatha had complaints too , most of which centered_on hundreds of polling_stations where votes were cast_on ballots that did not carry the party ' s name . Inkatha agreed to join the elections just a week ago ; election officials had promised to add an Inkatha sticker to the bottom of each ballot . The electoral commission urged election officers to allow voters to write in Inkatha , and it said a decision would be made later on whether to accept such ballots . More_than 9 million new ballots with Inkatha ' s name were printed overnight Wednesday and distributed by planes and helicopters across the country early Thursday . Election officials said all complaints will be investigated , and the electoral commission asked the South_African police to investigate the commission ' s own distribution procedures . Despite the difficulties , many South_Africans were heartened by the tranquillity that prevailed as they went_to the polls for a final day , and a new , upbeat mood was evident across the land . &quot; The vast majority of people have participated in this historic event in a remarkably disciplined and calm way , &quot; the ANC ' s Naidoo said . &quot; The people , both black_and_white , are now united in their desire to build a new South Africa. &quot; De Klerk said he was surprised to see &quot; an atmosphere so_much different from the atmosphere only a week before . It ' s almost as if the election has breathed an air of reconciliation . And that is what the country needs. &quot; The bomb_blasts of earlier in the week , allegedly the work of right-wing whites bent_on disrupting the elections , were largely forgotten with the arrest of 31 whites linked to the armed wing of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement . That group ' s leader , Eugene Terreblanche , used the time-honored theme of swart gevaar , or black danger , to exhort followers Thursday to prepare_for battle against the new government . &quot; From next week , we are not resisting the white National Party , &quot; he said . &quot; We are preparing ourselves to resist the radical black Communists , who we know will try to drive us out. &quot; Despite Terreblanche ' s warnings , most South_Africans were more confident than ever before that their elections had been a success . The long waits of Wednesday , when millions turned_out the vote and many were turned_away , were gone_in many areas on Thursday . A radio_station was sending_out regular &quot; voter traffic reports &quot; from its traffic helicopter , advising where the lines were shortest . On the East Rand , a volatile region of black townships southeast of Johannesburg , dozens of polls that had been closed on Wednesday for lack of ballots and voting materials were open Thursday . In Thokoza , where hundreds of blacks have died in fighting between ANC and Inkatha supporters , the streets were_quiet . Bongi Msimang , the presiding officer at a voting station there , had to fight_back angry crowds Wednesday , when ballots failed to arrive . But on Thursday she was awakened at 4 a.m. by a delivery of newly printed ballots . And , by midday , more_than 1 # 500 people had voted there and a long line had dwindled to a_few dozen people . &quot; It ' s much better today , &quot; Msimang said . &quot; I am confident everyone will get the chance to vote here today. &quot; Hernos Khumalo , a 50-year-old factory_worker , had waited all day Wednesday to vote , only to be told the ballots had not arrived . But , like tens of thousands of South_Africans , he was back Thursday and able to vote . &quot; Yesterday , I was so upset , &quot; Khumalo said . But , he added with a smile , &quot; today it is marvelous . We ' re all voting now. &quot;</TEXT>
