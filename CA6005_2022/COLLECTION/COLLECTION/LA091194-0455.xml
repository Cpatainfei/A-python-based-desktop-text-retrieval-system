   <HEADLINE> TACKLING THE ODDS ; FOOTBALL : NISSIM LEON ' S PROGRAM IN WHICH HE SHARES HIS PASSION FOR THE GAME HAS KEPT MORE THAN 50 CHILDREN OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF TROUBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The words recognition and notoriety are not a part of Nissim Leon ' s everyday vocabulary . He is more apt to talk_about pride , community and , his favorite topic , children . Leon is president of the Boyle Heights Youth Football Assn . of the King Football Conference . The reason Leon founded the year-round program seven years ago remains his motivation : to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble . &quot; If we can do that through football , &quot; he said , &quot; then we ' ve won. &quot; Leon believes football taught him to be a winner , and he hopes it can do the same for the 7- to 15-year-olds . &quot; My goal is not to make professional_football players out of these kids , &quot; he said , &quot; but if that happens , that ' s great . I just want them to be productive citizens in their community. &quot; Leon , 26 , played varsity football at Roosevelt in 1984 and ' 85 , two 2-A City Section title seasons for the Roughriders . That football experience has provided Leon the lessons he tries to pass_on to the 50 to 60 youths in the program . &quot; I learned discipline , persistence and gained self-esteem during my years as a football_player , &quot; Leon said . &quot; These are all things that these kids need to learn to survive in this community. &quot; The neighborhood harbors a sizable gang population and is racked by poverty , a potentially dangerous combination for young minds . So Leon offered football as a solution . &quot; There was never any football program in Boyle Heights , but now the kids are out here doing something positive , &quot; Leon said . &quot; They need an outlet and they need someone to care about them. &quot; Alongside Leon in his fight to save the children of Boyle Heights are some of his childhood friends and teammates , such_as Miguel Quintero . Quintero , 25 , who played varsity football at Roosevelt from 1984-86 , has been involved in the youth program since its inception . He can remember having to travel three miles to Salazar Park as a kid just to play a pickup game , because there was no program in the community . &quot; When I was growing_up , we went_far away to play football , &quot; Quintero said . &quot; Now these kids have a place in their neighborhood. &quot; With such a worthy cause , it might seem that sponsors would be clamoring to be associated with the program . But that hasn ' t been the case . &quot; This program owes itself to two people : Manuel Rojas and Nate Holden , &quot; Leon said . Rojas , owner of the local El Tepeyac restaurant , donated $ 1 # 500 to get the program started . &quot; I cared because this is my neighborhood , &quot; Rojas said . &quot; They told me if I helped them out , ( the program ) would last forever. &quot; Holden , the 10th District city councilman , was instrumental in getting $ 1 # 500 over seven years from the Amateur Athletic Foundation . Despite such meager funding , Leon keeps the program running . Each boy pays a $ 30 sign-up fee that covers insurance . Each year , the program finds a medical facility , such_as Northeast Clinic this year , to offer free physicals . Practice is held at Roosevelt High from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday . Much of the equipment -- shoulder_pads , pants and jerseys -- are donated by the Roughriders . And Leon stores the equipment in his garage . And the program ' s organizers , including Leon , work without pay . The lack of parent participation has nagged Leon over the years : &quot; Parents don ' t help_out much because many of them are first-generation Latinos who don ' t understand football or don ' t care. &quot; Leon does some impressive juggling with his own daily duties to supervise the program . In addition to being a full-time student at Glendale City College , he supervises a child and family program at County-USC Medical_Center . Then he heads over to Roosevelt to instruct future Roughrider prospects . &quot; I want to play football , probably for Roosevelt , &quot; said Edward Lavoy , who plays for the Midget Team . &quot; I like the sport ; it ' s a good experience for me. &quot; Lavoy , who attends Hollenbeck Middle_School , lives in the Aliso Village housing project . Although he is just 13 , Lavoy seems to understand the importance of the program : &quot; This keeps me from being at_home bored or out_in the street. &quot;</TEXT>
