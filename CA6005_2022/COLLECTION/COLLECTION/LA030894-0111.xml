   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OXNARD ; LABORERS COLLECT ON LEMON CO. ' S SETTLEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Julia Salanoa says she plans to visit family in her native Samoa . Isabel Sapien will bank her money now that she is retired . And Maria Godinez says her check will be spent on a baby due in June . The three women are part of a class-action sex discrimination lawsuit against the Oxnard Lemon Co . settled last year . More_than 100 current , former and prospective packinghouse employees are sharing_in the $ 575 # 000 settlement . On Monday , they started collecting their money . &quot; We are very happy , &quot; said Godinez , 37 , who picked_up a check for $ 1 # 176 at_work on Monday . Godinez , who will collect a total of $ 4 # 248 , will receive two more checks within the next two years . &quot; This is very good for us , &quot; added the 16-year packinghouse laborer . &quot; It gives us more opportunity to have work. &quot; The lawsuit , filed_in 1991 , alleged that Oxnard Lemon upheld a pattern of discrimination against women in hirings , promotions and job assignments . The suit alleged that women were given fewer regular and overtime hours and no access to or training for higher-paid positions . Last June , U . S . District Judge David D . Kenyon ruled that the company was guilty of discriminating against women in hiring . A settlement was reached a_few months later . Under terms of the settlement , Oxnard Lemon agreed to maintain non-discriminatory hiring and promotion practices . In addition , the company reserves for women some jobs traditionally held by men . Company officials have said that the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing but an attempt to avoid a costly , drawn-out legal battle . They also have maintained that women have always been able to hold any packinghouse job they applied for and were qualified to do . Under terms of the settlement , five named plaintiffs will get $ 20 # 000 each ; two other named plaintiffs who complained of discrimination in hiring each will receive $ 10 # 000 ; $ 325 # 000 will be divided among 94 current and former workers who were discriminated against in job assignments and promotions ; $ 115 # 000 will go_to 29 hiring discrimination victims , and $ 15 # 000 will go_to pay_for arbitration , if necessary , to enforce the agreement . In addition , California Rural Legal Assistance and a private Chicago law_firm will split $ 675 # 000 in attorney fees . More_than a dozen former and prospective employees showed_up at CRLA ' s Oxnard office Monday to collect the first installment of the settlement . Salanoa picked_up the first of three checks toward her $ 6 # 372 settlement amount . &quot; For those girls , it was good for them , &quot; said the 65-year-old Salanoa , who retired last year after 26 years with Oxnard Lemon . &quot; Now women are able to work where they want. &quot; FRED ALVAREZ</TEXT>
