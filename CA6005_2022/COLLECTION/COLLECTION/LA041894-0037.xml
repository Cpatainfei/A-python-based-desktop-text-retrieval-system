   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART : THERE ARE WAYS TO BYPASS VEHICLE STALLED IN THE CAR-POOL LANE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dear Street Smart : I recently came_upon an interesting situation on the northbound San Diego Freeway . A CHP officer had a vehicle stopped in the car-pool lane with a single person in the car . He had his emergency lights on and was out of his vehicle talking to the single occupant . I was in the third lane and not involved with this situation . Question : If I were in the car-pool lane and came_upon this scene , what are my options ? Do I pull_out ( safely ) and cross the double yellow lines into the No . 1 lane and proceed around them , or must I stop and wait until the officer is through_with the action he has taken ? William Huber , Garden Grove What you witnessed was unusual , said Steve Kohler , a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in Sacramento . It may have been that the officer did not stop the vehicle in the middle of the lane , but that the vehicle stopped there of its own accord , he said . If you had been traveling in the car-pool lane and come_upon this situation , you would be correct in stopping 300 feet or more behind the officer and waiting for the officer to direct you into another lane of traffic , Kohler said . If you were to come_upon a disabled vehicle or some_other obstacle in the car-pool lane , and there was no officer present , it would be permissible for you to cross over the double yellow lines and proceed with caution into the No . 1 lane , he said . * Dear Street Smart : In Dana Point , on Pacific Coast Highway and Del Obispo Street and the entrance to Harbor Drive , there are no street_signs . I live_off of Del Obispo farther north , and friends of ours have a hard_time finding our street . Mike J . Siminuk , Dana Point If you look closely , you will see street names painted on the curbs in your neighborhood . But I agree -- that does not butter a lot of parsley when people are trying to find your house and they have to keep their eyes glued to street level . Take_heart . A citywide program in Dana Point is now in_progress to install overhead street_signs where they are lacking and replace old signs with snazzy new ones . Signs for Harbor Drive , Pacific Coast Highway and Del Obispo Street are included , he said . Installation of the signs began in January , with each street given a priority , said Jerry Gonzalez , traffic engineer for Dana Point . Most of Dana Point ' s major intersections already have been outfitted with new overhead street_signs and work_on residential streets will begin within the next couple of weeks , he said . Part of the signage program includes a face_lift . The new signs will be blue and white and include the city ' s logo , Gonzalez said . All existing green-and-white signs also will be replaced , he said . The entire program , including residential_areas , probably will not be completed for at least another year , Gonzalez said . * Dear Street Smart : Are there plans to extend the Century Freeway from its present end at the San Gabriel River Freeway 1 1 / 2 miles east to the Santa Ana Freeway ? Why or why not ? Brian D . Bowski , Mission Viejo Thirty years ago , when the Century Freeway ( formally known as the Glenn M . Anderson Freeway ) was in the planning stages , Norwalk residents balked at the idea of yet another freeway slicing_through their city , said Jill Anderson , senior management assistant for Norwalk . The Santa Ana and San Gabriel River freeways already separated the community geographically . Because of these community concerns and objections , the Century Freeway was not designed to connect with the Santa Ana Freeway , she said . * The Orange County Transportation Authority has scheduled a public hearing for 9 a.m. April 25 to discuss proposed changes in bus_fares and transfer fees . The hearing will be held at the County of Orange Planning_Commission Hearing Room , Hall of Administration , 10 Civic Center Plaza , Santa Ana . The proposed changes include offering a new discounted fare coupon providing 10 rides for $ 9 ; issuing transfers at no charge ( currently the transfer for full cash fares is 5 cents , with seniors and people with disabilities receiving transfers at no charge ) , and extending the time in which transfers can be used from 1 1 / 2 hours to two hours ( while also limiting the number of transfers to two times within the OCTA system ) . Other recommendations include keeping the following : * $ 1 full cash fare ; * 45-cent fares for peak hours and 15 cents for off-peak hours for seniors and people with disabilities ; * Monthly passes of $ 37.50 for residents , $ 33.50 for students and $ 18.50 for seniors and disabled people ; * Fare exemptions for up_to three children , 6 years and under , who ride with a fare-paying passenger .</TEXT>
