   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON HEARING FOCUS IS_ON EVIDENCE TESTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Skirmishing on the eve of a highly charged preliminary hearing , defense_attorneys and prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson murder case squared_off Tuesday over scientific tests being performed to determine whether the superstar athlete was at the scene of the bloody double homicide . Simpson did not speak during Tuesday ' s emergency hearing , the fourth court session since his arrest after an internationally televised pursuit June 17 . Unshaven and seemingly detached , he glanced around the courtroom as his lawyer and representatives of the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office agreed on parameters for sharing certain evidence and conducting tests on it . Simpson ' s lawyer , Robert L . Shapiro , agreed Tuesday to provide prosecutors with a sample of his client ' s hair for comparison with hair discovered in a blue knit cap found at the scene of the murders . Prosecutors have said in court papers that the hairs are &quot; of African American origin &quot; but have not linked them to Simpson . While the hair samples are the latest disclosure of evidence in the case , much of the argument in Thursday ' s preliminary hearing will focus_on another body of forensic evidence -- bloodstains . According to police sources , investigators have taken blood samples from the scene of the murders , from Simpson ' s driveway , from inside his Ford Bronco and from a pair of dark brown work gloves , one found at the scene , the other outside his Brentwood home . Police crime lab specialists already have run tests on some of those samples , and forensic evidence pointing to Simpson as the likely culprit is expected to be introduced by prosecutors at the preliminary hearing -- at the end of which a judge will decide whether there is enough evidence to force Simpson to stand trial for the slayings of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . Even as prosecutors prepared_for Thursday ' s hearing , police continued to hunt for more clues . Armed with a new search_warrant , a team of officers descended on Simpson ' s house late Tuesday , in part , sources said , to search for the missing murder weapon -- a large knife that investigators in Los Angeles and Chicago have been unable to find . The officers were accompanied by police_dogs and were carrying metal detectors to aid in their search . Legal experts generally agree that while the prosecution ' s case is unlikely to hinge_on recovering the murder weapon , finding it would fill a hole in the case against Simpson that his attorneys can otherwise be expected to exploit . With physical evidence apparently underlying much of the prosecution ' s case , Shapiro on Tuesday asked Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell to direct prosecutors to split_up blood samples so that Simpson ' s experts can conduct their own tests -- presumably to counter any results offered by prosecution witnesses . Shapiro said he was not satisfied by a prosecution offer to allow Simpson ' s experts to observe while prosecution analysts performed the tests . &quot; We are entitled to conduct our own independent tests , not simply to sit and look over the shoulder of the district_attorney and the LAPD crime lab , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; It does us no good simply to watch what somebody else does. &quot; The judge agreed in part , and ordered prosecutors to share whatever samples they could . Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , the lead prosecutor in the case , said government lawyers had no objection as long as the samples were large enough to split without jeopardizing the testing process . &quot; We have nothing that we have to hide from the defense , &quot; said Clark , a theme she repeatedly emphasized during Tuesday ' s brief hearing . &quot; This case is an open book. &quot; In addition to blood samples , police discovered strands of hair in the blue knit cap found near the bodies . Once prosecutors obtain the samples of Simpson ' s hair , they will be subjected_to DNA analysis , like the bloodstains . None of the DNA results will be part of the preliminary hearing . Instead , prosecutors expect to present results of a less rigorous blood testing process known as serology -- one that scientific experts say can narrow the odds against two matching samples coming from different people to about 1 in 100 . DNA testing is far more exact , and prosecutors expect to complete those tests in time for Simpson ' s trial , should there be one . But the standards are lower at a preliminary hearing , in which a judge must only decide whether there is enough evidence for a defendant to stand trial . If even the less exacting tests point to Simpson as a likely suspect , legal_experts said , they might satisfy the requirements of the preliminary hearing . &quot; It doesn ' t take much to bind someone over , &quot; said Harland W . Braun , a prominent Los Angeles defense_attorney . &quot; The preliminary hearing is so that a judge can quickly look_at the evidence and make_sure that there hasn ' t been a mistake , not so that they can decide whether he ' s guilty. &quot; The hair testing procedures are similar and could depend_on the quality of samples taken from the scene , scientists said . Microscopic examination of hair has extremely limited value in a criminal investigation , according to Dr. Paul R . Billings , a forensic expert at California Pacific Medical_Center . DNA fingerprinting of hair samples can be much more effective , but only if there is enough DNA for accurate testing , he added . The hair shaft -- the part that protrudes above the skin -- contains virtually no DNA and is essentially useless , Billings said . DNA is contained only in the root of the hair , the follicle . Prosecutors said Tuesday that they have both hair shafts and follicles to examine . But analysis of a single hair , even if the root is present , is an &quot; iffy &quot; proposition , according Mark Stolorow , director of operations for Cellmark Ltd . in Germantown , Md. , one of the leading laboratories in DNA fingerprinting . &quot; Not all DNA tests on hair roots are going_to give interpretable results because of the wide variations in DNA concentrations ( in the roots ) . But there is at least an even_chance that you can get an interpretable result. &quot; Because of the small amount of DNA present in the hair root , laboratories use a different analytical technique on hair . The method is slightly faster than conventional DNA fingerprinting -- taking about four weeks , compared to eight to 10 weeks for conventional testing -- but the results have so far been accepted in only a_few courts , primarily in the East , Billings said . Blood testing is generally more precise than the test performed on hair samples , and preliminary DNA tests on some of the blood samples already have been conducted . Although those results will not figure in the preliminary hearing , Kennedy-Powell ordered Clark to turn the results over to Shapiro . In agreeing to do so , Clark noted that some tests have yet to be performed , in part because investigators have not had a chance to thoroughly examine all_of the more_than 60 pieces of evidence gathered . Clark said prosecutors expect to spend at least a week presenting their evidence at the preliminary hearing , and Shapiro has said that Simpson may offer a defense -- an unusual tactic for a preliminary hearing that could greatly extend its length . Former federal prosecutor John Shepard Wiley Jr. , a UCLA law professor and an expert in_evidence , said the blood_test results that will figure prominently at the preliminary hearing may be important at that stage , but will not be &quot; the main event &quot; at a trial for Simpson if he is bound over . &quot; The DNA will definitely be the large prize the prosecution is seeking , &quot; he said , while adding that the results also could turn against prosecutors if they point to another suspect . &quot; The defense could establish that there was some human_being other_than O.J. Simpson at the murder scene . that ' s not conclusive , but it is extremely powerful. &quot; As for the hair samples , Wiley said , they would provide powerful evidence only if the prosecution can show that the hat was left there during the crime and not during an earlier visit . While the case heads to court for the first public unveiling of the evidence , much attention has focused_on exactly when the murders occurred . Pinpointing the time is important to both sides because Simpson ' s lawyers have said that he was at_home when the killings occurred and that he could not have had time to commit the crimes and still be home_in time to meet a limousine that arrived to take him to the airport for an 11:45 p.m. flight . A coroner ' s report suggested that Nicole Simpson was still alive and speaking_to her mother on the telephone about 11 p.m. One of Simpson ' s attorneys , F . Lee Bailey , quickly jumped_on that information to assert that his client could not have committed the crime . But the report was contradicted Monday by Nicole Simpson ' s father , Louis Brown , who said the conversation actually occurred closer to 10 p.m. Bailey , who has commented at length about the case in recent days , was unavailable Tuesday to respond to the comments by Nicole Simpson ' s father . An assistant said he was halting all public statements for the time_being . Police_Department officials would not comment on whether they have obtained phone records that would reveal the exact time of the call . Phone_company officials also declined to discuss the issue in detail , even to confirm or deny whether they have received a search_warrant for the records . Larry Cox , state manager of public affairs for GTE California , said the company routinely complies with such court_orders but that it usually takes at least five working_days to produce the information . In very special circumstances , usually in cases involving criminal charges , the company also releases early billing information to the customer , he said . &quot; Otherwise , we are specifically precluded from releasing that information , &quot; Cox said . &quot; We take protecting our customers ' phone records very seriously. &quot; Times staff writers Thomas H . Maugh II , Henry Weinstein and Rebecca Trounson contributed to this story . * SHELTERS TO GET FUNDS : City , county pledge $ 6.1 million to house abuse victims . A24</TEXT>
