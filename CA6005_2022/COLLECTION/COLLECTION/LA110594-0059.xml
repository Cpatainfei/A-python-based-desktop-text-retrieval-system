   <HEADLINE> GOP TRIES APING THE WHITMAN SOLUTION ; CAMPAIGN : CANDIDATES ACROSS COUNTRY ARE PUSHING N.J. GOVERNOR ' S TAX CUT PLAN . THEY SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM THE EARLY SUCCESS OF HER ECONOMIC_POLICIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perhaps the best evidence of New Jersey Gov . Christine Todd Whitman ' s emergence as a national political force came this week when she became the target of an orchestrated campaign attack by a Democratic gubernatorial candidate -- in Maryland . Maryland Democrat Parris Glendening is running hard against a woman who styles herself a &quot; Christie Whitman Republican , &quot; promising to copy the New Jersey chief_executive ' s enormously popular state economic_policies , which are highlighted by steep income_tax cuts . Recently , Glendening invited five New Jersey residents to a press_conference to warn Maryland voters of nightmarish budgetary consequences for their state should they choose a Whitman clone . Like the Maryland race , this fall ' s elections in many states are turning_to a remarkable degree into a referendum on the economic_policies of New Jersey ' s first woman governor -- who narrowly defeated incumbent James J . Florio last year on a promise of tax and spending_cuts . At issue is whether the Whitman-style mix of immediate tax cuts and longer term spending reductions offers a formula for a Republican revival in the 1990s , or will boomerang into a repeat of budget-busting &quot; trickle-down &quot; Ronald Reagan economic_policies . So far , however , Whitman and her policies have proved hugely popular in her state and the 48-year-old governor is in constant demand as a speaker and fund-raiser for Republican candidates all across the nation , from Senate candidate Olympia J . Snowe in Maine to Gov . Pete Wilson in California . In fact , GOP operatives are already touting her as a potential vice presidential candidate in 1996 . Her success so far has prompted shameless copying of her economic agenda by Republican candidates in one state after another in this election season . In the process , she has helped put cutting taxes back at the top of the Republican agenda , helping the party move beyond the debacle of candidate George_Bush ' s failure to live_up_to his &quot; read my lips &quot; pledge not to raise taxes . In New York , for example , Republican George Pataki is challenging Gov . Mario M . Cuomo with a Whitman-style tax cut platform , while tax cuts are at the heart of the gubernatorial campaigns of David Beasley in South Carolina , Frank Keating in Oklahoma and Ellen Sauerbrey in Maryland . Whitman ' s success also has bolstered the Republican commitment to make promises of steep tax cuts at the federal level a central element of the party ' s campaign to win control of Congress as well . More_than 300 Republican candidates have signed onto a controversial &quot; contract with America , &quot; which calls_for a wide range of personal and business tax cuts , including a $ 500 per child tax_credit , tax relief for married_couples , expanded individual_retirement_accounts and a 50 % cut_in the capital_gains tax for businesses . More broadly , the popularity of Whitman ' s economic agenda has underscored once again for the Republican_Party that the winning formula for political victory is being fashioned at the state level by a new breed of moderate Republican governors -- rather than in Washington . Whitman has joined John Engler in Michigan , William F . Weld in Massachusetts and Tommy G . Thompson in Wisconsin as leaders in an attempt to give new energy to their party . &quot; What we are doing here is what other Republican governors have been trying to do around the country in the last couple of years . I just may have defined the agenda a little more clearly and moved it more rapidly , &quot; Whitman observed in a recent interview . Whitman owes her high approval ratings in large part to her unique mix of conservative fiscal_policy and liberal social agenda , highlighted by her stance in favor of abortion rights , thus offering what she hopes is a model for dominance by the GOP . More concretely , though , she has begun to carry_out her most controversial promise of the 1993 campaign . After pledging to cut income_taxes by 30 % over three years , she has pushed_through a 15 % tax cut_in her first year in office . But many analysts said that they believe her politically popular tax cuts represent a ticking fiscal time_bomb that will lead to budgetary disaster for New Jersey -- and political disaster for Whitman -- raising questions about whether her policies really offer a solid model for her party . Even Whitman ' s aides conceded that a huge budgetary shortfall in a state with a balanced-budget law may mean that she will not be able to cut taxes again next year . That could force her to seek another huge tax cut at the end of her term , if she is to live_up_to her campaign pledge . And that could force her to indulge in bookkeeping sleight_of_hand or other gimmicks to make the budgetary math work . State_Treasurer Brian Clymer already is scrambling to find ways to cover a deficit that could reach $ 2 billion next year in a budget that totals just $ 15.3 billion . &quot; This next budget is going_to be the toughest , &quot; acknowledged Whitman . &quot; But really , the next three or four budgets are all going_to be very tough. &quot; What ' s more , economists and political analysts said that her policies already are putting pressure on local_governments to sharply increase property_taxes to offset shortfalls in state aid for schools and municipalities . State funds account_for about 30 % of municipal budgets around the state . Although local property_taxes have risen at a slightly slower pace in 1994 than they did_in the last year of the Florio administration , analysts said that they expect the pressure to increase next year , when Whitman almost certainly will be forced to cut state aid to cities and towns to balance her budget . &quot; There is a direct_correlation in New Jersey between state income_tax revenues and local property_tax rates and so people in this state are going_to have an opportunity to see the trade-offs that have to be made as a result of her income_tax cuts , &quot; argued Florio , now an attorney in private practice . &quot; New Jersey has suffered under tax_rates that are too high but the problem is she is conducting a tax shift rather than a tax decrease , &quot; added Rep . Robert G . Torricelli ( D-N.J. ) , who is considering a run against Whitman in 1997 . &quot; She has reduced income_taxes and that will put pressure on state aid to towns and schools and that will put pressure on property taxes. &quot; Whitman dismissed such dire warnings , arguing that there is no direct link between income_taxes and property_taxes , even though local aid by the state represents a huge chunk of the New Jersey budget . This year , Whitman was able to take a series of relatively painless actions to pay_for her first round of tax cuts , while still presenting a balanced_budget . Florio insisted that he left Whitman a $ 400-million budget surplus , which acted_as a down_payment on tax relief . In addition , Whitman came_up with about $ 1.3 billion by reducing state contributions to the state employee pension_fund and the state employee health_care system . Whitman said that those trust_funds remain fully funded and that the state was previously putting too_much money into them . Democrats and employee unions charged that she is eroding their financial stability , which will lead to higher state payments or reduced pension and health benefits in the future . Those actions allowed Whitman to avoid severe cuts_in the state budget this year and to enact $ 600 million in income and business tax cuts while reducing spending by just $ 200 million . State aid to municipalities and school districts was frozen , but overall was not reduced . One of the only spending_cuts that has had a direct impact on voters came_with her elimination of a state fund that helped stabilize tuitions at state colleges . With the fund in place in 1993 , state tuitions rose an average of 3.6 % . This fall , tuitions rose more_than 6 % . State analysts said they doubt that Whitman can continue to find enough easy savings to avoid far more painful choices in her next budget , due in February . She must find at least $ 1.4 billion to cover another looming deficit next year , not counting the $ 480-million costs for fiscal 1996 that she would incur if she cut income_taxes another 15 % next year . What ' s more , Whitman faces the huge potential costs of complying with a New Jersey Supreme Court_order for the equalization of state educational funding . So as she scrambles behind closed doors to craft a new budget , most New Jersey Democrats are patiently waiting to see what she does . &quot; In her first year . . . she was able to defer the downside of her policies , &quot; argued Henry Raimondo , a professor of public policy at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University . &quot; The question now is , does she have any more rabbits to pull_out of her hat ? &quot; Profile : Christine Todd Whitman Here is background on the 50th governor of New Jersey * Age : 48 * Education : Bachelor ' s degree in government from Wheaton College in 1968 . * Career : Began her career at the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity , followed by a stint at the Republican National Committee .
