   <HEADLINE> U.S. MAY OFFER TECHNOLOGY TO N . KOREA AS BARGAINING TOOL ; ASIA : NEW REACTOR WOULD LESSEN CHANCE PYONGYANG COULD MAKE NUCLEAR ARMS . BUT COST , OTHER PROBLEMS LOOM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration and its allies have gradually figured_out what sort of bribe it would take_to persuade North_Korea to abandon its nuclear_weapons program : more advanced nuclear-power technology . Now they are zeroing_in on the hard questions : What countries are going_to pay_for it and how ? Who will provide the new technology to North_Korea ? In talks with the United States , North_Korean officials have made_it clear that they would like to have what is called a light-water reactor -- that is , nuclear technology that is more modern and more efficient than anything in North_Korea ' s existing nuclear facilities . That idea is being seriously considered by the Administration because such advanced technology reduces the possibility that North_Korea would be able to convert byproducts into fuel for nuclear_weapons . Light-water reactors produce a lower-quality plutonium than the gas-graphite technology the North_Koreans are now using . U.S. officials believe North_Korea has produced enough plutonium in its facilities at Yongbyon to make one or two nuclear bombs . And two months ago , Pyongyang removed spent fuel rods that could also be used to produce plutonium for about five weapons . &quot; If they get_rid_of their gas-graphite technology , that would be much better than the status_quo , &quot; one Administration official said . From the North_Korean point_of_view , a light-water reactor would provide much-needed power for the country ' s energy-starved economy . Problem solved ? Hardly . The price_tag for a light-water reactor is roughly $ 2 billion . And there are all sorts of laws that would prohibit the United States or its allies from supplying any kind of nuclear technology to an outlaw regime like North_Korea , with which the United States has no diplomatic relations . So , at the moment , Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci -- the Administration ' s top negotiator with North_Korea -- is traveling the globe , visiting South_Korea , Japan , China and Russia , largely in an effort to resolve the legal and diplomatic tangles surrounding light-water reactors . Should Japan and South_Korea , the countries most threatened by a North_Korean nuclear_weapon , pick_up the entire tab ? Should the United States contribute too ? What countries , or companies , would supply North_Korea with the light-water technology ? Who would provide the financing ? What would happen to the export-control restrictions ? Those are the sorts of questions Gallucci must resolve if he is to have any chance of making a deal over North_Korea ' s nuclear program . The United States and North_Korea are scheduled to meet in Geneva next Friday to resume the negotiations that were broken_off when President Kim Il Sung died July 8 . For the moment , at least , Administration officials are trying to play_down the scope of these difficulties . &quot; The important thing here is less the obstacles than on just getting there , &quot; said one U.S. official working_on North_Korean issues . &quot; We ' re open_to anything that works. &quot; But there are already signs of resistance in Washington to the idea of providing North_Korea with new nuclear technology . Some Administration officials are said to have balked at the suggestion of spending U.S. funds to help North_Korea . Resistance in Congress seems to be high too . After all , critics ask , even if Pyongyang eventually puts all its nuclear facilities under international safeguards , it is only carrying_out its obligations as a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . Why should it be rewarded ? Sen . Frank H . Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) recently won Senate approval for new restrictions on any U.S. financial assistance to the Pyongyang regime . And many existing laws , including the Trading With the Enemies Act , already bar U.S. aid to North_Korea . U.S. officials have voiced hope that , in the end , South_Korea and Japan will help pay_for all or most of the costs of a light-water reactor for North_Korea . Officials in these countries have made vague statements suggesting that they would be willing to support the idea but have given no firm commitments . In addition to questions of money , there are also disputes over which country ' s technology might be used for a light-water reactor in North_Korea . The United States uses light-water technology in most of its nuclear plants , as do South_Korea , Britain , France and other countries . So does Russia , and Moscow has talked_about supplying four light-water reactors to North_Korea . A Russian light-water reactor might be cheaper than one using Western technology . And it might be installed more quickly , diplomats say , because Russia has already done the feasibility studies that would be required if some_other system were used . However , in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster , there would also be many problems in ensuring the safety of any Russian reactor . It ' s also conceivable that South_Korea could supply the light-water technology . But diplomats worry that the Pyongyang regime is simply too proud and insecure to accept technology from the South .</TEXT>
