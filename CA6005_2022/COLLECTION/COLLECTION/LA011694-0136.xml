   <HEADLINE> SNOW HAS 40 SAVES FOR USA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They were teammates and roommates at the University of Maine , and their bond grew stronger when goaltenders Mike Dunham and Garth Snow joined Team USA in preparation for the Winter_Olympics . That friendship will endure , they say , no matter which is chosen to start in the Olympic opener Feb . 12 in Lillehammer . And while Dunham was once the sure choice , his monthlong slump , coupled with Snow ' s strong play since returning from a call-up with the NHL ' s Quebec Nordiques , makes that choice anything but clear . &quot; I know how he feels , because I struggled in August , &quot; Snow said after making 40 saves in Team USA ' s 5-2 victory over Team Canada , played before a sellout crowd of 16 # 215 at McNichols Arena . &quot; we ' ll get_through this . At the same time , who ' s to say we ' re going to go_with one goalie all_the way through , that we ' re not going_to alternate ? It ' s a coaching decision and we ' ll live with it. &quot; Snow gave_up two goals in the first 5:20 but frustrated Team Canada ( 25-20-3 ) the rest of the way to earn his 11th victory and reduce his goals-against average to 3.15. He has won both of his starts since rejoining Team USA . By contrast , Dunham has given_up 23 goals in his last three games and lost all three . In the last six weeks , his goals-against average has gone_up almost a goal , to 3.75 , and his save percentage has plummeted to . 871 . U.S. Coach Tim Taylor hasn ' t decided whether to stick_with one goalie or to alternate the two . &quot; The idea is to play the hot goaltender and if that works with the team chemistry , go_with that , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; If I start a goalie and he has a great game and I feel I should come_back with him , I will. &quot; Snow outplayed his Canadian counterpart , Corey Hirsch , as Team USA improved its record to 34-15-5 . Canada ' s top line of Chris Kontos , Petr Nedved and Paul Kariya was blanked , though the trio produced many good chances . Kariya , drafted fourth overall by the Mighty Ducks last June , left the game with 17 seconds to play after being cut above the left eye by Brett Hauer ' s stick , but he was not seriously hurt . Jim Campbell , John Lilley , Ian Moran , Darby Hendrickson and Todd Martin scored for Team USA .</TEXT>
