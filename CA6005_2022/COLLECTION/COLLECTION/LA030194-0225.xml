   <HEADLINE> ASBESTOS ABATEMENT IS A QUAKE SIDE_EFFECT AT NORTHRIDGE MALL ; CLEANUP : THE TEMBLOR TRIGGERED AN ALL-OUT EFFORT TO RID THE CENTER OF THE CARCINOGENIC MATERIAL -- FALLEN OR STILL IN PLACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A few hours after the Jan . 17 earthquake , John Graham , vice_president of property management at MEPC American Properties Inc. , which owns the Northridge Fashion Center mall , made an urgent phone_call from his Dallas office . &quot; I ' m willing to bet there ' s asbestos in there . . . on the floors &quot; in the mall , Graham told Lou Magnifico , construction manager at Professional Service_Industries Inc. , an asbestos abatement contractor in Walnut . Magnifico hurried that day to the mall and took pictures of the heaps of fallen ceiling tiles and drywall . When Graham saw the photos , he spotted a telltale gray , fluffy-looking material amid the rubble and said , &quot; Uh-oh. &quot; And so began a multimillion-dollar asbestos cleanup and abatement effort at the Northridge mall , which is about a mile from the epicenter and by far the most heavily damaged shopping_center from the quake . Two other shopping_malls , Topanga Plaza in Woodland Hills and Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood , have also undergone asbestos cleanups since the temblor , although nothing like the undertaking at the Northridge mall , where the plan is to remove every bit of the cancer-causing substance -- even what was not dislodged by the quake . &quot; Asbestos is an emotional subject , &quot; Graham acknowledged . Although asbestos is not considered to be a health hazard if it is properly maintained , &quot; our corporate philosophy is just take it out. &quot; MEPC , a subsidiary of British real_estate concern MEPC PLC , purchased the Northridge Fashion Center in December as part of a $ 302-million acquisition of American holdings . Now MEPC is hoping to turn its bad_luck into opportunity . When the mall reopens in July -- except for its six department_stores , which will take longer to rebuild -- MEPC hopes to publicize the center ' s squeaky-clean condition . Asbestos is present in more_than half of all commercial and residential buildings 15 years old or older , authorities say , and in some newer buildings . Asbestos is resistant to heat and very durable , but in recent years it has been discovered that asbestos materials that are moved or broken may release microscopic fibers into the air . If inhaled , these fibers can cause lung disease and other cancers . The substance is considered to be inert , however , when left intact . In any building containing asbestos , experts say , it is necessary to test the air to see how many particles might have shaken free . Air_pumps with filtering devices are used in the testing . If a high level of airborne asbestos is found , cleaning_up the site may include misting to weigh_down floating particles , wet-wiping hard_surfaces and using big vacuums with special filters to trap the tiny fibers . Workers doing the cleanup must don protective clothes that resemble space suits , which are used once and discarded . Clothes and other porous items from the stores being rid_of asbestos will also be bagged and sent to asbestos-disposal sites . Things took an odd turn recently , when police investigated a report that 20 members of an asbestos cleanup crew had walked_off with asbestos-contaminated new clothing from the Sears outlet at the Northridge mall . No one was arrested , since taking items headed for a toxic-waste dump apparently is not a crime . Sears , which owns the store , was responsible_for the asbestos cleanup and had hired a crew from CST Environmental in Anaheim . Sage Khara , CST ' s president , said he was outraged by the &quot; theft &quot; of the clothes and fired those workers the same night . &quot; It was a very devastating experience for us , &quot; he said . CST has also been doing emergency asbestos work for MEPC at most of the other Northridge mall stores . Graham said that CST has worked for his company five years , and has been reliable . This week , CST and other companies will bid on a new asbestos cleanup contract at the Northridge mall . Meanwhile , security_guards are charged with ensuring that nothing is taken from stores during the cleanup . &quot; We made_it clear to CST that heads will roll if it happens with us , &quot; Graham said . Asbestos shaken loose in the quake has been a bigger problem at shopping_malls than at other large commercial structures in the Valley . Most of the office and industrial buildings with the worst quake damage were made of concrete slabs , without asbestos . Also , many office_buildings old enough to have contained asbestos -- say , some of those along Ventura Boulevard , built_in the 1960s and 1970s -- had been rid_of the substance before the quake . &quot; There is not nearly as much asbestos in the Valley as there was five years ago , &quot; said Seth Dudley , senior_vice_president at real_estate brokerage Julien J . Studley Inc. in Los Angeles . Nonetheless , asbestos abatement contractors have been busy since the quake . Asbestos cleanups have also been done at Cal State Northridge , a Kaiser Permanente medical_building in Granada Hills and the County_Courthouse in Van Nuys . Northridge Fashion Center , Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza were built_in the ' 60s and early ' 70s , when asbestos was commonly used for fireproofing and insulation . The malls had done some asbestos abatement in the past , as tenants moved_out , but a comprehensive asbestos-removal project would have meant closing the malls temporarily . Until the earthquake , there was no compelling reason to remove asbestos that was safely contained . Still , Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza will have some asbestos remaining . David Reed , director of facilities services at CenterMark Properties , owner of Topanga Plaza , said that over the years , asbestos had been removed from 75 % of the mall and all common areas . About 16 shops were contaminated when the earthquake dislodged ceiling tiles , exposing sprayed-on asbestos behind them , he said . The total Topanga Plaza asbestos cleanup and abatement is estimated to have cost less than $ 250 # 000 . Some shops will still have asbestos , Reed said , but it will be properly maintained and the air in the stores will be monitored for particles . At Laurel Plaza , some asbestos that had been sprayed in ceilings and walls was released by the quake and subsequent repair work . The asbestos cleanup will probably be completed this week , General_Manager Brian Pearson said . When the mall reopens April 15 , about 80 % of the asbestos will have been removed . &quot; There is no reason for concern , &quot; Pearson said . &quot; We are following the laws. &quot; Scott Lange , hazardous materials coordinator at Los Angeles property management company Shuwa Management , said that leaving old asbestos in place is &quot; absolutely safe , as long as there ' s correct air monitoring. &quot; And Dudley does not believe asbestos will detract from property values . &quot; Even in high rise-office buildings with asbestos , I haven ' t seen a significant effect on rental rates , &quot; he said . But Northridge Fashion Center owner MEPC is doing a full abatement anyway , at a cost expected to run to &quot; seven figures , &quot; according to MEPC President David Gruber . MEPC is expecting part of that expense to be covered by its earthquake insurance , although it is still negotiating with the insurer . About 25 store sites and some common areas of the Northridge mall have asbestos that was sprayed onto the structural_steel . The day after the earthquake , 100 workers began sweeping the mall corridors from one end to the other and bagging anything suspected of being hazardous . The crews began monitoring the air in the mall and sealing_off tenant spaces . On the thick plastic placed over the shops with asbestos , the word HOT was spray-painted in red . MEPC plans to clean 15 feet into stores that don ' t have asbestos , in case fibers drifted into them . Merchandise with hard_surfaces , such_as jewelry , also is being cleaned . MEPC expects to complete the removal project by May 1 . Until then , floors are vacuumed each morning . Asbestos workers in contaminated areas wear respirators and the protective suits . They pass_through mobile chambers where they remove the suits and bag them for disposal , then shower and change .</TEXT>
