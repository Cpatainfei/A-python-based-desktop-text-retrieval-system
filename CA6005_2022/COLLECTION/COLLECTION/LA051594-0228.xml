   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA FACTIONS BALK AT NEW PEACE PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and his fellow foreign_ministers said they did not expect immediate results from their new peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina . On Saturday , they were proven right . Bosnian Muslim leaders denounced the proposal from the United States , Russia and the European Union as legitimizing the Serbs ' conquests , and they said a proposed four-month cease-fire is too long . Bosnian Serbs said the cease-fire is too short and showed no sign of embracing the allies ' terms for a negotiated settlement . Even the peace plan ' s authors said they consider its prospects for success to be slim -- at least without military intervention or some_other form of direct pressure from the United States and its allies . &quot; History tells us the chances are probably not great , &quot; said a senior U.S. official involved in the negotiations . &quot; Nonetheless , we have to give it a shot. &quot; The problem , he added , is that the United States and its Russian and European allies do not have enough leverage over the Bosnian Serbs to push them into a deal . &quot; It is something that has always been lacking , &quot; he said . &quot; That is very much on our mind. &quot; What the big powers accomplished here last week was to agree on their goals in Bosnia : an early cease-fire , followed by negotiations toward a settlement that divides the country about equally between the Serbs and a Muslim-Croatian federation . After two years of discord , they are finally singing from the same page in the diplomatic hymnbook . But they are not doing much more_than singing , and the Bosnian Serbs have not paid much attention to the outside world ' s entreaties thus far . If they ignore this new appeal for negotiations , the allies are not quite sure what their next act will be . The Bosnian Muslim prime_minister , Haris Silajdzic , put the dilemma in a nutshell when he spoke_to reporters at a champagne reception Christopher hosted at the U.S. mission Saturday to honor the doleful Muslim and Croatian negotiators : &quot; What if the Serbs don ' t talk ? &quot; he asked . &quot; We could be frozen in the situation we ' re in . What if they talk and stall ? We will be stuck again . What if they reach an agreement and just don ' t implement it ? Where do we go then ? &quot; Silajdzic condemned the plan as a sellout of the Bosnian Muslims ' hopes of keeping their country unified -- &quot; Munich on television , &quot; he said , referring to the diplomatic conference that awarded part of Czechoslovakia to German dictator Adolf Hitler in 1938 . And the Bosnian Muslim president , Alija Izetbegovic , said the four-month cease-fire proposed by the allies is too long . &quot; We believe two months would be enough if we want to obtain a political settlement , &quot; Izetbegovic told reporters in Sarajevo , according to the Reuters news_agency . At the same time , a spokesman for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that four months is too short . &quot; We are in favor of a permanent cessation of hostilities , &quot; he said -- a formula the Muslims fear would lead to a permanent Serbian occupation of their lands , of which the Serbs have captured 70 % . Still , Silajdzic said he will try to work with the new proposal -- especially if the allies back_up their unified message with measures to enforce a settlement . &quot; We are looking_for guarantees , &quot; he said . &quot; We are looking_for commitment from the international community. &quot; What kind of commitment ? &quot; Force should be used to implement these agreements , &quot; Silajdzic said . To which the allies replied , in_effect : We ' re not ready for that yet . &quot; We understand what the prime_minister is saying , &quot; the U.S. negotiator said , but &quot; we have to give ( the peace plan ) a chance &quot; without any threats of force . If that does not work , then the question of using military power to implement or enforce an agreement may arise , he said , but &quot; I can ' t tell you how it ' s going_to be answered by the political authorities of any of our countries. &quot; President Clinton has repeatedly ruled_out the use of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia except as peacekeepers after a settlement is reached . Senior State_Department officials said that prohibition still stands . Russia ' s chief negotiator , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , said cheerfully that the way ahead is clear : &quot; Now is the time to tell the parties what to do , &quot; he said . But he acknowledged that the allies have not agreed on how to enforce their desires . Russia has often defended Serbia ' s interests in the talks , urging the other countries to begin lifting U.N. economic sanctions against Belgrade as an early part of the process .</TEXT>
