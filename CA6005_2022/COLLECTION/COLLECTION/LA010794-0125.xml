   <HEADLINE> ELDERS ASKS SMOKERS TO ACT TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders on Thursday urged parents who smoke to seek help in quitting or to indulge their habit outside their homes and cars , saying : &quot; Your children are the innocent victims of your addictions. &quot; Lending her support to a new national campaign against the dangers of secondhand smoke to young children , Elders acknowledged that cigarette smoking is a tough addiction to break.But she pleaded with parents to think_about the health consequences of their smoking on their offspring . &quot; We , as adults , have a choice , &quot; she said . &quot; But our children have no choice. &quot; Last year , the Environmental Protection Agency classified secondhand smoke as a Group_A carcinogen , meaning it is known to cause cancer in humans . Moreover , children ' s exposure to environmental smoke is known to cause lower respiratory infections , ear , nose and throat problems and potentially serious complications in those suffering from asthma . Walker Merryman , vice_president of the Tobacco Institute , which represents the industry , agreed that &quot; everyone is and should be concerned with the health and well-being of children , &quot; and that smoking parents &quot; may want to exercise common_sense about smoking in front of their children in the same way they use common_sense about other exposures and activities. &quot;</TEXT>
