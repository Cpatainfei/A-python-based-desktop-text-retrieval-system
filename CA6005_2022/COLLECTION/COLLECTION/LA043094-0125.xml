   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA FACTIONS REFUSE TO BUDGE IN NEGOTIATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb and government officials refused to budge in negotiations Friday despite the first united appeal by U.S. , Russian and European envoys to resolve the conflict . Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government has threatened to pull_out of the talks unless Bosnian Serb fighters and heavy_weapons are_well clear of the battered Muslim enclave of Gorazde . And Bosnian Serbs , whose leader , Radovan Karadzic , met with the envoys in Pale , reiterated their stance that a final territorial settlement hinges_on lifting the sanctions against the remaining territory of Yugoslavia . U.S. envoy Charles Redman said a major issue of the day ' s meetings was the duration of a future cease-fire between government troops and Bosnian Serb forces . The government wants it limited to three to four months , while the Serbs are seeking a permanent truce . The government fears a permanent cease-fire would freeze current front_lines . Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he &quot; will accept only a temporary cease-fire. &quot; Following his talks with the negotiators , who were planning to return to Sarajevo next Thursday , Izetbegovic insisted the Serbs had not lived_up_to the NATO ultimatum to withdraw soldiers from a 1.9-mile radius and heavy_weapons from 12 miles around Gorazde . Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly declared they pulled_out of the exclusion zones even before the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s ultimatum expired , and U.N. and NATO officials say the Serbs have sufficiently complied . Serbs continued to hinder U.N. peacekeepers on Friday , turning_back reinforcements headed for Gorazde and prohibiting military observers from taking pictures of weapons still within the exclusion zone around Sarajevo . Meanwhile , a British soldier was killed and two others were injured Friday when they drove over an antitank mine near Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia , Britain ' s Defense Ministry said . The incident brings the_British military death toll in the region to five .</TEXT>
