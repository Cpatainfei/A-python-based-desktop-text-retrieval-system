   <HEADLINE> PROGRAM FOR RUSSIA ATOM SCIENTISTS TO START ; DIPLOMACY : PROJECT AIMS TO KEEP WEAPONS EXPERTS FROM DEFECTING TO OUTLAW STATES . MOSCOW IS BLAMED FOR DELAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and Russia are only now ready to embark_on a program announced two years ago to prevent nuclear scientists from the former Soviet_Union from selling their skills to outlaw states such_as Libya . U.S. officials blame Russian political infighting for the delay in launching the project , which is finally about to get under way with a scheduled meeting of the directors of a science center that is supposed to offer the scientists peacetime jobs . The officials say the plan still is vitally needed , even though the predicted rush of defections by scientists has not materialized -- at least not yet . Economic conditions have deteriorated steadily for the once-pampered scientists who made the Soviet_Union a nuclear superpower , a State_Department official said . Many scientists have rejected job offers from Iran , North_Korea , Libya and other countries looking_for backdoor entry into the nuclear club , but they may be unable to hold_out much longer . Some lower-level scientists have already left , most of them for China , which is already a nuclear -power . But top scientists who could design a nuclear bomb from memory have stayed_put . The idea of aiding nuclear scientists arose in February , 1992 , when James A . Baker III , then secretary_of_state , visited a top-secret nuclear laboratory on the Siberian side of the Ural Mountains . Baker was told that the scientists who work there were eager to turn their talents to civilian research but that the Russian government lacked the funds to finance it . The next day , Baker and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin announced plans to create a science center to fund peacetime projects . The plan was launched with great urgency . Even so , no scientific jobs have been created and nothing much has been done . The old Russian Parliament refused to ratify the plan because , U.S. officials speculate , it became embroiled in political warfare between the lawmakers and Yeltsin . The Russian president revived the idea by decree after he closed_down Parliament last October . Although action by the newly elected Parliament probably will be required eventually , the organization has provisional authorization to go_into operation . Early next month , the board of directors of the proposed center -- representing the United States , Russia , the European Union and Japan -- will meet in Moscow to organize and to consider proposals for projects that create jobs . In the two years since the Baker and Yeltsin announcement , the EU ( formerly called the European Community ) and Japan have joined Washington in supplying money for the project . About $ 70 million is available -- $ 25 million from the United States , about $ 28 million from the EU and $ 17 million from Japan . That is little more_than seed money , U.S. officials admit . However , they say that if the plan works the way they hope it will , the Russian science projects will soon begin to produce revenue that can make them self-sustaining . &quot; When the science center concept was first conceived , we were just beginning to deal with dislocations from the demise of the Soviet_Union , &quot; a State_Department official said . &quot; We suspected that ( mass defection of nuclear scientists ) was something that might happen . &quot; We are now at the point where the impact on weapons facilities is real . These centers which once were sheltered and privileged have now experienced the kind of dislocation that might cause people to make life decisions. &quot; With modern computers and modems , it may_not even be necessary for a scientist to leave the country to go_to work for Iran or some_other nuclear aspirant . During the Soviet period , the KGB could be counted_on to prevent the emigration of scientists or anyone else with even a remote connection with the country ' s defense Establishment . The Russian government has taken steps to prevent scientists from defecting , but U.S. officials say that Moscow ' s grip is becoming less sure as democracy takes_hold . &quot; To a fairly substantial extent , the Russian government knows who is in its scientific community , the 200 or so top designers and theoreticians , &quot; the State_Department official said . &quot; On the other hand , their ability to prevent them from going anywhere may be declining , &quot; the official said . &quot; How do you prevent someone from going_to China and then to North_Korea ? . . . There are too many unknowns now. &quot;</TEXT>
