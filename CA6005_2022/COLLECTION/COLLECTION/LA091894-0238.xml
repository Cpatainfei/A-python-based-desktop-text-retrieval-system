   <HEADLINE> PASSION + BASEBALL = KEN BURNS ; TELEVISION : THE EPIC 18 1 / 2-HOUR STUDY OF THE SPORT , HAS ITS DEBUT TONIGHT ON PBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is passion in filmmaker Ken Burns ' voice when he talks_about baseball . It is intense , almost as intense as his anger over the strike that shut_down the sport this summer . &quot; I think these guys have forgotten that they are the custodians of more_than the bottom_line , &quot; Burns said . &quot; They just don ' t get it. &quot; &quot; Baseball , &quot; Burns ' epic 18 1 / 2-hour study of the sport , debuts tonight on PBS , which showcased his monumental film of the Civil War two years ago . For him , the order of projects was logical . &quot; I knew for the 5 1 / 2 years I was making ' The Civil War ' that this was the sequel , &quot; Burns said . &quot; If you wish to know the country the Civil War made us , study baseball . If the Civil War was the American Iliad , I think baseball is the American Odyssey. &quot; Burns ' affection for the game began in his childhood . Born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn , he grew_up in Newark , Del. , and Ann Arbor , Mich. , loving baseball and rooting first for the Dodgers , then for the Orioles and finally the Tigers . &quot; It was a great time of my childhood , the one refuge I had , &quot; he said . &quot; My mother was_sick with cancer much of the time and died when I was 11 . It was a hard childhood for me , except for baseball. &quot; Then , like so many fans , Burns abruptly dismissed the game . &quot; It was not relevant for me for a time , &quot; he said . &quot; There were other things going_on -- Vietnam , civil rights. &quot; By 1975 , Burns found himself in New England and rediscovered baseball , just in time for the great Boston-Cincinnati World_Series . &quot; The fact that I left baseball was outrageous , &quot; he said . &quot; When I came_back to it , it was like I lifted my head out of the sand. &quot; The film project represented a daunting task . &quot; The Civil War was the story of four years that had a start a middle and an end , &quot; he said . &quot; Baseball is 200 years , the story of America with powerful characters , a story that takes_in race , the labor struggle , immigration , the rise and decay of great cities . It is a story that still isn ' t finished. &quot; The ratio of footage shot to footage used for this project was 30-to-1 . &quot; It runs 18 1 / 2 hours and we had to cut a lot to get there , &quot; Burns said . &quot; The Civil War was 11 1 / 2 hours . I could do 11 1 / 2 hours just on the Brooklyn Dodgers. &quot; Although much of the film is nostalgic , Burns is not a sentimental sort . &quot; We have the mistaken idea that history is just a political-civic narrative , &quot; he said . &quot; History is normally dry dates , facts and events . Emotion is what makes_it stick_in the mind and heart . This film stirs powerful emotions . I am an emotional archeologist. &quot; Burns has this little test that he uses to compare the relevance and impact of baseball against other sports . &quot; Tell me , &quot; he said , &quot; how many points did Wilt Chamberlain score ? How many yards did Walter Payton gain ? &quot; People don ' t know those numbers . But they know 56 and . 406 and 61 and 714 and 755 . Those numbers mean something over time . &quot; Baseball is unique in a number of ways . There is no clock . You play against yourself and your own excellence . The defense has the ball . No other sport does that . &quot; It is a sport with rigid rules played_on fields with different dimensions . It is the only game you can win or lose on a play in foul territory . It begins in spring and ends in fall , just like life. &quot; Then there is the_matter of success at the task . In basketball or football , you can find a successful play and run it over and over and over again . How often did the ball go_to Michael Jordan when he played for the Bulls ? How frequently did San Francisco use passes from Joe Montana to Jerry Rice ? &quot; In baseball , Babe_Ruth came_up only once every nine times , &quot; Burns said . &quot; The greatest baseball_players fail seven in 10 times and they ' re still in Cooperstown . Things like that make baseball unique. &quot;</TEXT>
