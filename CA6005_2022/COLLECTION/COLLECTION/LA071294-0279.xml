   <TEXT> That chic and sumptuous high-pile carpet that adorns the lawyer ' s office in Stuttgart , Germany , or the beachfront condo in Redondo Beach may have begun its life here on a high-backed vertical loom worked by Meena , 13 . Six days a week , the village girl and seven friends , who sleep_in a single cramped , dark room in a dirty dormitory whose halls smell of urine , get_up at 6 a.m. and , after gulping down a meager breakfast of warm tea , begin work . Meena , a small girl with straight black hair who is timid as a rabbit , sits on a rough plank , facing her loom . Guided by a chart on which each dye color bears a different number code , she begins to tie strands of triple-ply yarn to make that most luxurious of household items , the hand-knotted carpet . Her small fingers flying , again and again she ties knots -- an average of 60 to each square_inch . At 9 p.m. , after hourlong breaks for lunch and dinner that she and her friends have to speedily cook for themselves , the 13-year-old ' s workday is over , 14 1 / 2 tedium-filled hours after it began . Tomorrow will be much the same for her , hunched_over the loom in a long , dim room where the floor is made of filthy bricks and where the only sounds as dozens of youngsters work in silence are the foreman ' s cries and the thud of metal mallets swung by the children to pack the knots more densely . Meena , daughter of peasants from Nepal ' s impoverished hills , doesn ' t know it , but she is a valuable cog in her country ' s economy . Just as the bedrock of the Old_South was cotton and tobacco and England ' s fortune was spun in the &quot; dark satanic mills &quot; of the Midlands , the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal has come_to count_on carpets . And , at_the_same_time , like many other developing countries , this nation has rapidly grown dependent_on cheap , easily exploitable child labor . An estimated 160 # 000 Nepalese children work in carpet mills , sometimes alongside their parents at_home looms but often in appalling conditions of servitude little better than slavery , according to the Child Workers of Nepal Assn. , a social_organization . &quot; Hand-knotted carpets are made_out of the sweat and blood of children , &quot; charges Suman Srivastva , director of an Indian training institute for children freed from bonded labor . Nepal is not unusual . According to a study just released by the world ' s largest trade_union federation , 100 to 200 million children ages 4 to 15 work in streets , factories , mines and rock quarries from Brazil to the Philippines -- often under dangerous conditions and for a miserable wage or no compensation at all . The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free_Trade Unions , which claims to represent 120 million workers in the United States and 123 other countries , calls such widespread child labor &quot; the best-kept secret &quot; of modern commerce . All too often , the federation found , minors in developing countries are exploited to make_goods that are then shipped for_sale to richer lands , including the United States , whose youngest citizens are protected by child labor laws . In the Philippines , union investigators found , children work_up to 24 hours a day in peak season to sew lingerie for a German multinational to sell in Europe at a more_than 1 # 000 % markup . In Bangladesh , they reported , 40 % of 700 # 000 garment_workers are children , and most of their output is shipped to the United States . In Pakistan , say activists who oppose child labor , youngsters who work in sporting-goods companies that export field_hockey sticks , soccer_balls and volleyballs to America may never have any free_time themselves to play games . In Peshawar and Lahore , children perform the initial manufacturing work_on surgical_instruments but have poor access to health_care themselves . With its carpets , Nepal , one of the world ' s poorest countries , has scored a coup in overseas markets . Growing from a fledgling industry with a modest initial load of exports in 1964 , Nepal ' s carpet-makers last year shipped 34.2 million square_feet -- enough carpets to cover nearly 600 football_fields , goal post to goal post -- and earned $ 204 million , or 60 % of Nepal ' s export income . Foreign consumers , especially Germans , who buy 80 % of Nepal ' s carpets , have fallen_in_love with their warm , muted colors , thick woolen pile and abstract , non-Oriental motifs . From this boom , Meena and other child workers benefit little more_than did the Lancashire millworkers of the Industrial Revolution or the antebellum slaves . In interviews , the young Nepalese said they are paid just enough to buy_food , pay rent ( their landlord owns the carpet factory ) and purchase cloth to make into clothes . For each square_meter ( about a square_yard ) of carpet that she ties , Meena is supposed to be paid the equivalent of $ 7.40. In two weeks , she is lucky to finish a square_meter . Abroad , that much of her handiwork retails for $ 153 to $ 184 , according to factory owner Nyami Tashi Lama . Brokers scour the countryside to keep the 1 # 200 carpet factories in Bhaktapur and other Katmandu valley locales filled with small hands , social_workers report . Some brokers pay ignorant or gullible parents for the children ; others promise to send home a percentage of their wages . Often , no money is sent . &quot; The bosses prefer children , &quot; said Anju Shrestha , program officer with the Nepal Center for Women and Children Affairs . &quot; Their hands are considered to be defter , and they are more patient. &quot; Country girls , who are commonly submissive and quiet , are believed to make the best carpet workers of all . Once in the Katmandu valley , the children often become bonded labor , working long hours for no pay to reimburse a theoretical debt that they or their parents are supposed to owe to the broker or factory owner . &quot; In most cases , they never see the money they are supposed to earn , &quot; Shrestha said . For Meena , the gap between her wage and the value of what she makes is too abstruse to understand . For this girl who has never been inside a schoolhouse , the high point of the week is Saturday night , when she watches Nepalese movies with the other child workers on their factory owner ' s television . Her back always hurts , she complains , like those of all_the young_girls , who took precious time from their lunch break one day last month to sit on tattered mats and learn the Nepali ABCs in a room overlooking tangles of drying yarn dyed aqua , violet and teal . One of Meena ' s friends now coughs all night but doesn ' t know why . Another has hands that hurt , especially in the winter . Social_workers say the children often develop eye problems from having to stare for years at their looms in the twilight of the carpet factories , and cases of premature arthritis are common . * Laws in Nepal prohibit the employment of children under 14 and limit 14- to 16-year-olds to 36 hours ' work per week . Some government officials or carpet magnates routinely cite such legislation to maintain that , since child labor is illegal , it cannot exist . But it is readily evident that the laws are massively flouted . N.C. Lamichhane , member secretary of Nepal ' s Carpet and Wool Development Board , a quasi-governmental body , adopts a franker approach than most . &quot; We never say we don ' t have child labor , &quot; Lamichhane said . &quot; We do . Our study shows it is 11 % ( of what he said was a 200 # 000-member work_force ) . that ' s due_to our poverty. &quot; It ' s also due , he acknowledged during an interview , to government connivance with factory owners over the years to ignore violations of child-labor laws . In developing societies , it should be noted , child labor has ardent defenders with plausible arguments . Alka Raghuvanshi , arts_editor of the Indian newspaper The Pioneer , says : &quot; It is important to remember that child labor , as it is understood in the West , is not applicable in the Indian context . . . . If a child is helping his father on the loom or the wheel , is he or she to be considered child labor ? &quot; * For those who clamor that all children should be educated , Raghuvanshi cites the sad example of the weavers of Andhra Pradesh , who after a_few flush years sent their children to school . Even with diplomas , the students couldn ' t find jobs , she said . And they hadn ' t served the long apprenticeships needed to become top-notch silk weavers . They ended_up , she said , making cheap towels and loincloths . Third_World countries also have viewed with suspicion Western campaigns such_as the Brussels-based labor confederation ' s to eradicate child labor and improve the lot of their work_force , considering them a masked attempt to wipe_out one of the few advantages they enjoy in an increasingly global economy : low wages . Finally , in the poorest of countries , for many children , the possibilities outside of employment are often scant . School exists for the lucky few . &quot; If a child is not employed , it will beg , or lie_in the street , or use drugs , &quot; contended Lama , the owner of Meena ' s factory , as he stood_in the middle of a garage where finished carpets were stacked for export . Lama thinks the government should supply teachers to instruct children at the factories so that they can learn and earn at_the_same_time . The 2 % export tax he has to pay on his carpets could be applied to pay_for the program , he suggests . Nepal ' s carpet industry was growing at a feverish rate , reaching 30 % to 40 % per year , but the breakneck pace seems to have ended this year . One reason appears to be a devastating eight-minute expose aired on German television last April that reported that 90 % of Nepal ' s export carpets were woven by children working in_conditions akin to slavery . &quot; It ' s wreaking havoc , &quot; complained B.P. Khanal , spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . The Carpet Board ' s Lamichhane denies that but concedes that export growth has slowed in the last 10 months to about 8 % . And he knows his industry has taken a painful public-relations hit . &quot; The trade is 100 % export-oriented . Unless the foreigners buy , we can ' t sell , &quot; he says . &quot; And who is buying our carpets ? The young generation . And they are very serious about such issues. &quot; For two years , U.S. diplomats in Katmandu say they have warned the Nepalese that unless they adhere to their own ban on child labor , they could have problems in foreign markets . Mounting consumer awareness is one reason . Another is a bill introduced by Sen . Tom Harkin ( D-Iowa ) , that would ban U.S. imports from industries employing child labor . The bill is awaiting action in the Senate Finance_Committee . Nepalese carpets had been assessed a 5.1 % duty in the United States , but since July 1 , they have been allowed_in tariff-free on the strength of the Nepalese government ' s certification that the carpets are indeed made by hand . American buyers now absorb less than 2 % of the Nepali output . Ironically , just as the opportunity dawns for the Nepalese to sell more carpets in the United States , their product may be getting the same politically unsavory reputation that non-union-picked grapes or lettuce once had . &quot; The Nepalese think this is a problem fomented by their competitors and it will go_away , &quot; a U.S. diplomat said with a disbelieving shake of the head . After the German telecast , the Nepalese Ministry of Labor mounted a loudly advertised crackdown on underage workers , with at least 150 factories reportedly visited by government inspections . &quot; Seventy-five percent of the children employed in the industry have now left , &quot; Lamichhane claimed last week . Meena and her friends have had a different view of the purported crackdown . When the first government inspector they had ever seen showed_up at their factory in early June , &quot; he went right to the office , &quot; the girls said . &quot; He never looked_at us. &quot; As they talked with a visitor to their ABC lesson , one teen-aged mother nursed a baby she would later place in a sling by her loom . Their ramshackle dwelling lay_down a dirt road in one of Nepal ' s most historic towns , temple-rich Bhaktapur , 10 miles east of Katmandu , where Bernardo Bertolucci filmed some of the scenes for his visually stunning epic &quot; Little Buddha. &quot; Little of that beauty rubs_off on the carpet makers ' lives . Their workday world is the factory , the squalid dorm , a solitary water_pipe in the smelly courtyard and an outdoor privy . It is possible that the cycle of child labor that Meena is caught in could continue indefinitely because of Nepal ' s poverty and the lack of many real employment alternatives . But Lamichhane is skeptical . Unlike many government officials and carpet manufacturers , who are portrayed by Katmandu-based diplomats as consummate ditherers , the carpet board official dreads the possibility of a Western boycott . &quot; Our major industries are tourism and carpets , &quot; he says . &quot; If we are not careful , we ' ll lose both . We must do something. &quot; His suggestion , similar to a plan already being implemented in India , is a label certifying that a carpet was not made with the labor of children ( that is , children under 14 ) and that the dyestuffs used are environmentally friendly . The German-Nepalese Chamber_of_Commerce has endorsed such a plan , and the Harkin bill also has a &quot; child labor-free &quot; labeling scheme . * In Nepal , however , putting such a project into execution is problematic . Many doubt the government or the factory owners can be trusted . &quot; We have an agreement already with our buyer that we will have no child labor in our products , &quot; Lama , Meena ' s boss , maintains . It ' s not clear whether he ' s trying to deceive or doesn ' t know he has 13-year-olds in his own 150-member labor_force . In any event , he was able to ship 80 # 000 square_feet of rugs to Germany last year without any problems . Meena lives and works with two older sisters , so her life is not as lonely as some children ' s . The girls have been home only once in the past year , for a religious_festival in October . It took them a day on a bus and two days walking through the_hills to reach their native village in the Ramechap district . Like her friends , Meena would like to go_home for good but says she has no other skills besides tying yarn into carpets . At 13 , she already seems to be worried about how she will earn her way in the world . The visitor asks her how she would change life in the factory if she were the owner . The girl is silent a long_time . No , Meena finally says , she can ' t imagine being the boss . Warning : Children at_Work Here are some examples of developing countries that use child labor , as reported by the International Confederation of Free_Trade Unions . INDIA : A quarter of the world ' s child labor_force is said to be in India . About 1 out of 4 children ages 5 to 15 reportedly are working . The total is thought to be between 17.5 million and 44 million . Legislation in 1986 banned child labor , but some employers openly defy the law . MEXICO : Children under 14 are banned from working . Children 15 and 16 may work_up to six hours a day , provided they don ' t work overtime or at night . Enforcement seems reasonably adequate for large and medium-sized companies , but less certain for small ones . There are significant numbers of underage street vendors . NEPAL : The law allows employment of minors at age 16 in industry and 14 in agriculture , but for not more_than 36 hours per week . Some government officials and carpet magnates routinely say that since child labor is illegal , it cannot exist . But it is clear that the law is massively flouted . PHILIPPINES : The constitution forbids employment of children under 15 except under the responsibility of parents or guardians , and then only if the work does not interfere with schooling . But children as young as 4 were found working in factories . Many children work in the garment industry , making women ' s clothing and lingerie for European multinationals .</TEXT>
