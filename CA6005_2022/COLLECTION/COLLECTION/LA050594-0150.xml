   <HEADLINE> THE CONTRAST IS STRIKING ; HUSBAND PICKETS , WIFE CROSSES LINE TO HELP FEED STUDENTS AT SON ' S SCHOOL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Things are kind of quiet around John and Pat Miller ' s household these days . * John Miller , 41 , a food delivery driver for the Orange Unified School District , spent Wednesday morning on a union picket_line outside district headquarters . A few blocks away , his wife , Pat , 39 , crossed a picket_line to help fill food service gaps at Handy Elementary School created by striking non-teaching employees , like her husband . She helped coordinate and serve hundreds of breakfasts and lunches to students at Handy Elementary -- one of the schools on her husband ' s meal delivery route . The Miller family has suddenly become a house divided as a strike by hundreds of classified employees enters its third day , straining bus , child-care , custodial and food services in the district of 26 # 000 students . &quot; It ' s very quiet now at_home , &quot; said the Millers ' 8-year-old son Kevin , a second-grader at Handy Elementary . &quot; My mom , she helps_out at school . And in the afternoon , my dad , he goes_out on strike. &quot; Few families are facing the inner turmoil that the Millers are trying to cope_with , which began Monday when an estimated 400 members of the California School Employees Assn. , Chapter 67 , went_out on strike . But with union and district officials refusing to back_down in their fight over a school board-imposed contract , there is no telling when the tension may ease_up . &quot; I respect what she ' s doing . She has to do what she has to do , &quot; said John Miller , a district worker for the past two years . &quot; But when you pay your union dues , you ' ve got_to back the union. &quot; For Pat Miller , who works part time as a teacher ' s assistant at Handy , the welfare of the students outweighs all other concerns -- even her husband ' s predicament . &quot; He was real mad at me -- he called me a Benedict Arnold , &quot; said Pat Miller , who was named Volunteer of the Year last year at Handy Elementary . &quot; I feel_for the working person . I mean , how much are you going_to take before you do something ? &quot; But , &quot; she added , as she unloaded another tray of burritos from the oven for a line of hungry students , &quot; I ' m doing what I ' m doing for the kids. &quot; * John Miller said he too believes he is acting in the best interest of his children , Kevin and 6-year-old Danielle . He said a potentially job-threatening clause in the contract forced upon the union by the school_board in March pushed him to strike . The clause empowers the district to lay off workers or reduce their hours without negotiating . The contract also imposes three furlough days and reductions in health benefits . &quot; I can live with the insurance cutback , &quot; said John Miller , who is also a Little_League coach . &quot; But it ' s not right that they can lay you off and cut_into your hours like that. &quot; District officials defend the contract , saying it is vital in keeping the cash-strapped district solvent . By saving about $ 485 # 000 , the contract helps offset a $ 2.2-million budget shortfall this year , they say . The 3-day-old strike continues to try the patience of hundreds of district parents , now forced to battle through traffic_jams in dropping_off and picking_up their children . About 7 # 000 students in the district are charged $ 180 per month for bus transportation , but during the strike only special_education students are receiving service . Although it has released no specific details , the district has promised that parents will receive credit for days of lost bus_service . Also hard hit by the strike have been child-care , custodial and food services . Six child-care centers remain closed , and of the 18 open , many are short-staffed . And students normally accustomed to hot meals are complaining about the cold food they are being served . that ' s where Pat Miller and scores of other parent volunteers around the district have helped ease the service_cutbacks caused by the strike . Around the district ' s 37 schools , parent-volunteers are picking_up trash , answering phones and helping prepare breakfast and lunch . * Their efforts have not gone unappreciated by teachers and administrators , who themselves have had to double_up on_duties since the strike began . Handy Elementary Principal Anita Jameson had only enough time to eat a pack of animal crackers for lunch Wednesday . &quot; Pat is our be-all and end-all . She ' s been an enormous help , &quot; Jameson said as she policed the lunch tables . John Miller said that if the strike doesn ' t end soon , he may have to reconsider his decision to stay off the job . He said the walkout is taking a heavy toll of the family ' s finances . &quot; I ' ve got_to feed the family , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
