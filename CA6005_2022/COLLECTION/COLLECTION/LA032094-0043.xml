   <HEADLINE> HACKMAN , BEYOND IT ALL ; ON THE SET OF HIS 62ND MOVIE , HOLLYWOOD ' S TIGHT-LIPPED LONER CONTEMPLATES RETIREMENT -- EVEN AS HE FACES THE CAMERA FOR YET ANOTHER TAKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There won ' t be a lot of talking , that is a given , but his taciturnity still comes as a surprise . &quot; I might , &quot; he says , setting the terms of his availability with great economy , letting his blue eyes scan the room with that elusive , shuttered quality seen in his films . Think_about it : Buck Barrow in &quot; Bonnie and Clyde , &quot; Popeye Doyle in &quot; The French Connection , &quot; Bill Dagget in &quot; Unforgiven , &quot; even Avery Tolar in &quot; The Firm , &quot; all men tight as safes , ulcers in the making . This much is true : That bottled-up quality girding all_of Gene Hackman ' s performances springs from a deep personal reticence , a loathing of exposure . Talking to the actor , even over lunch in his trailer here in the Arizona desert , even at what is arguably the apex of his career , is like robbing a bank . Whatever goods to be gotten will be under duress and passed_through a very small window . &quot; Well , only because I don ' t like talking_about myself , &quot; he says , pausing to swallow some ice_tea , pensive in the winter light pooling on the little Formica table , on his restless , ruddy hands . &quot; I just , I don ' t know -- I guess I ' m a private person . For me , acting is a kind of private thing , and I just don ' t like sharing it. &quot; For those who know him , this is nothing new . Hackman , they ' ll tell you , is one of the champion loners , hellbent on not keeping_in touch . Acting is his escape and his solace , his craft , as he likes to think_of it ; he is happiest when he has some acting problem to resolve , but wary when his job is examined too closely . &quot; When I ' m doing_it , I think it ' s great and I like doing_it , &quot; he says . &quot; But to watch it or any of the other parts of the business is so alien to me , I don ' t get_it . There is part of you emotionally that says , ' I don ' t know why they bother to ask me to work. ' The intellectual part says , ' Well , you have a body_of_work and and you ' ve done this , that and the other , so they ' ll ask you to work again. ' &quot; He grips the glass between his hands , staring into its blue plastic depths . &quot; When I do see my films , I ' ll say to my son , ' I don ' t understand it , I don ' t understand why I ' m doing this and why they keep asking me. ' &quot; UNTIL HE MADE &quot; THE FRENCH CONNECTION &quot; IN 1971 , GENE HACKMAN worried that he would never work again . This despite the fact that , at 40 , he had starred on Broadway , made 13 films and been twice nominated as best supporting actor , for &quot; Bonnie and Clyde &quot; and &quot; I Never Sang for My Father. &quot; But it wasn ' t until he won the Best Actor Oscar for playing the raging New York City police_detective Popeye Doyle that Hackman crossed that line in his own mind . He was finally a star . &quot; Once I got_through ' French Connection , ' I felt pretty good about what I was doing. &quot; Hackman , now 63 , with 60-plus films to his credit and a second Oscar -- for best supporting actor in &quot; Unforgiven &quot; last year -- is in_demand enough to no longer fear unemployment , to even contemplate retirement . He is known for working a lot , maybe too_much . &quot; The Poseidon Adventure , &quot; &quot; Lucky Lady , &quot; &quot; March or Die , &quot; these he made_for the money , he has said . Sometimes he regrets that , &quot; but only for a minute or two , because it really doesn ' t mean that much. &quot; Mostly , he says , he doesn ' t want to become one of those guys who hang_around &quot; out of ego because they could not stop. &quot; Not that that seems remotely likely . If his name no longer sells tickets on its own , you hear him described in hushed reverential tones as one of the greatest American actors , a modern-day Spencer Tracy . Warren Beatty , who hired Hackman to play his brother in &quot; Bonnie and Clyde , &quot; considers him one of the best American actors working . So do Dustin Hoffman and Clint Eastwood . Robert Duvall has called him America ' s &quot; Everyman. &quot; Even now , two of Hackman ' s co-stars on his current film , &quot; The Quick and the Dead , &quot; Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio , agreed to do the film largely because of the chance to work with him . &quot; I don ' t know when you get_in the league of people like that , &quot; says DiCaprio . &quot; Right now he ' s at the top of his form , &quot; adds Sydney Pollack , who directed Hackman in &quot; The Firm &quot; last summer . &quot; Almost at a Zen-like place in his acting where you don ' t see the effort , he ' s so comfortable with himself. &quot; While many of his contemporaries resort_to age-parodying comedies -- &quot; Grumpy Old_Men &quot; and &quot; Finding Ernest Hemingway &quot; -- Hackman presses_on , armed with an ambassador-like stateliness , playing generals , sheriffs and lawyers , regal tough_guys . He had a less-than-happy experience on Broadway in &quot; Death and the Maiden &quot; in 1992 . But his performance as the coolly cruel sheriff in Clint Eastwood ' s &quot; Unforgiven &quot; was a most-public rebound after a two-year film hiatus due_to an attack of angina and subsequent surgery that left the actor and sometime sketch artist contemplating a move to Italy , to Carrara and its fabled marble quarries , where he would become a sculptor . But &quot; Unforgiven &quot; changed things , reminding Hackman how much he likes to shoot long , complicated , dialogue-rich scenes . And the Oscar brought renewed attention that was , predictably , seductive . &quot; You ' re offered a lot of things , &quot; he says , &quot; and it ' s attractive in a way , then you get tired and you think , ' I don ' t really need to do this. ' &quot; He does , however . When friends tell him to cut_back , be more selective like his pal Hoffman , Hackman rebuffs them : &quot; Dusty doesn ' t like to act_as much as I do. &quot; He can ' t sleep past about 5:30 anymore , so eager is he to attack some sort of artistic problem , some puzzle , redesign yet another house or build an aerobatic airplane with his 31-year-old son , Christopher . But mostly Hackman wants to solve the perennial challenge of bringing a script to life , finding those ideas , the behavior &quot; that will convince the audience that this could be a real person . that ' s what interests me about acting , &quot; he says . &quot; Playing the game. &quot; Hackman has become a regular player in the current craze for Westerns , turning_out four in the past two years -- including the upcoming &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; and &quot; The Quick and the Dead. &quot; In the latter film , co-starring Sharon Stone , Hackman plays Herod , an outlaw with a penchant for killing friends and family . If he doesn ' t think the genre suits him particularly well -- &quot; I think the best scenes are always interior scenes . You have more control as an actor . Just by definition , Westerns have to be shot outside &quot; -- it is not surprising , given his subtly shaded , emotionally dead-on performances . When he started acting , an ex-Marine and fabled barroom brawler , Hackman ' s work was distinguished by a manic energy , a tangible unease . He was such an avid fan of Marlon Brando that he would play the bongos on the roof of the Pasadena Playhouse with Hoffman , a fellow student , &quot; just because we knew Brando did , &quot; recalls Hoffman . His technique , too , was Brando-esque , seamless , invisible , slightly menacing , perfect for playing wired , instinctual men like Buck Barrow and Popeye Doyle , less perfect elsewhere . He was fired from &quot; The Graduate &quot; because he had &quot; so_much juice and vitality , &quot; recalls director Mike Nichols , energy that was all wrong for the burnt-out man he was supposed to portray as Mr. Robinson . Even when Hackman appeared in comedies , most vividly as the prissy Lex Luthor in the &quot; Superman &quot; movies , his mania was filtered through an implied sense of threat . &quot; Gene always has an element of danger about him , &quot; says Pollack . &quot; You ' re never completely sure of what he ' s going_to do. &quot; Indeed , it was his less flamboyant roles , including his two favorite performances -- the paranoid surveillance expert in Francis Ford Coppola ' s &quot; The Conversation &quot; and the eccentric ex-con in &quot; Scarecrow &quot; -- where Hackman used his flinty unpredictability in subtle yet more daring ways , turning it inward on himself . Some have called it honesty , but it goes_deeper than that , to that rare talent that separates him from the Jack Nicholson-Warren Beatty-Clint Eastwood school of bravado -- a willingness to show his characters ' disappointment with themselves . An Everyman . He seems to recognize it himself : &quot; I figure that there is probably something in me that the camera sees that people relate to that says , ' This is an OK guy ' or ' He ' s probably not that bad. ' &quot; Off-duty on the set of &quot; The Quick and the Dead , &quot; the line between the performer and the man blurs . It isn ' t that Hackman looks as imposing as one of his film performances -- although dressed in his fancy gunslinger ' s costume , the bleached white of his shirt spangled with gold studs and a_few drops of fake blood , his sandy hair tousled and face flushed , Hackman resembles a 19th-Century circuit rider or a wealthy homesteader just in from checking out his acreage . That blurring has more to do with the psychic restlessness he evinces off-screen . Hackman has a reputation for being difficult , for having run-ins with directors that , if not quite legendary , are_well known . His authority problem , as he still refers to it , dates to his troubled youth -- his mother ' s alcoholism , his father ' s desertion -- the source of the anger that colored his early years and still fuels his acting . Despite Hackman ' s aloofness , his demurrers about his personal life , there is a melancholy about him that suggests an ongoing ambivalence about his sepia-toned past in Danville , Ill. , a lonely youngster caught in an unhappy household in a dead-end Depression-era town . While acting was his ticket out , it also became the lightning_rod for all those turbulent memories . Even now , when Hackman says he is more relaxed than at any point in his career , he still keeps his distance on a set . Production assistants on &quot; The Quick and the Dead &quot; whisper that the atmosphere grew sober the day Hackman arrived . &quot; I ' ve never worked with an actor of this caliber before , &quot; says director Sam Raimi , whose last film was &quot; Army of Darkness &quot; with Bruce Campbell . &quot; I feel_like a kid trying to hang onto a kite. &quot; And the terms of this interview suggest a persistent uneasiness : two lunch_meetings of approximately 30 minutes each and whatever other casual conversations on the set he is prone to . that ' s it . No dinner , no drinks , no rides in the limo . Not even a follow-up phone_call . &quot; Gene is the kind of guy who thinks a 10-minute conversation is too long , &quot; says Dick Guttman , the actor ' s publicist for nearly 25 years . Indeed , privacy is what Hackman craves , whether on a film set or at_home in Santa Fe , a modest two-bedroom adobe he restored himself that he shares with his second wife , Betsy Arakawa , a former classical pianist . He is selfish , he says , with his time . He doesn ' t see many people , mostly just his grown children , his son and two younger daughters , Leslie and Elizabeth , and he likes enclosed spaces , reading for six hours straight in his living room , hunkering down in a race_car or the cockpit of an airplane . &quot; He ' s not your basic extrovert , &quot; observes Eastwood . Hackman can be abrupt , given to awkward silences . Although he is courteous and not unkind , it is difficult to spend any time with him without feeling his impatience . Forget small_talk ; he is pained by attempts at false intimacy . Even obvious questions , like why so many Westerns now , are greeted with a sigh -- &quot; Who cares anyway ? &quot; -- that devolves into laughter , not derisive exactly , but a pointed reaction to the silliness of trying to rope some larger meaning out of his life now . He doesn ' t care , he says , about his professional ups and downs , his reputation for being difficult or about being liked for his knotty , problematic characters . &quot; I don ' t care if ( a guy ) is sympathetic or not , that ' s not important to me , &quot; he says , sounding almost angry . &quot; I want to make you believe this could be a human being. &quot; He says this , his eyes registering impatience , boredom and sorrow . For all his success and visibility , Hackman seems plucked from a John Cheever short_story , a former star athlete resigned to a life of commuter timetables , alimony payments and golf outings . His real_life exists just out_of_reach , in memory or imagination . MID-DECEMBER ON THE HIGH DESERT JUST EAST of Tucson , the wind can really kick_up , enough to drive cast and crew of &quot; The Quick and the Dead &quot; to don hats and parkas and transform the set ' s main_street into a bitter , snowless winter resort . Not exactly ideal conditions for the complicated series of shots Raimi wants to get this day -- tricky , tilted close-ups of Hackman and DiCaprio drawing their guns , shots that require a special camera and motorized dolly and what seems like endless technical adjustments . &quot; It ' s something Hitchcock used , and it will either be really cool , or they ' ll kick me out of the Directors Guild , &quot; says Raimi , scanning his storyboards . He has already shot several frames of Hackman , formally outfitted in boots , topcoat , silk tie and an enormous felt hat , drawing his ebony-and-gold-handled revolver . But actor and director are unhappy with the gun ' s position in the shot . &quot; I ' m going_over to shoot a bit , &quot; says Hackman , turning from the camera and heading across the street . Thell Reed , a champion quick-draw marksman and consultant on the film , is already putting DiCaprio through a_few practice rounds beyond the corral when Hackman strides up , spurs jangling . &quot; Hey , I want to check Gene out , &quot; says his slender 19-year-old co-star , pushing his corn-silk-colored hair out of his eyes . Hackman faces the distant mountains , plants his feet and squeezes off a_few rounds , yanking his gun from the holster with a practiced thrust of his hips . &quot; When did you first start quick-drawing ? &quot; asks DiCaprio , squinting up at Hackman . &quot; This is the first time. &quot; &quot; But you did_it in ' Unforgiven , ' right ? &quot; &quot; No , I just drew that one time . There wasn ' t even anybody on the set. &quot; Hackman fires in silence for several minutes , the shots echoing across the vast plateau . After the round , he probes Reed about cavalry draws , butt-forward twist draws , fancy stuff . Hackman ' s shots clock_in at 35 hundredths of a second . &quot; The fastest on film , &quot; says Reed . Hackman lets the remark pass , but the implication lingers in the stillness , that more_than 20 years after &quot; The French Connection , &quot; he has returned , in some measure , to the kind of violent films that first brought him prominence , the kind he wasn ' t going_to make anymore . Because of his kids , or maybe it was his agent ' s advice , he says , he turned_down the Hannibal Lecter role in &quot; Silence of the Lambs , &quot; and when Eastwood came calling with &quot; Unforgiven , &quot; he initially refused . &quot; ( His agents ) didn ' t want him to do_it , &quot; says Eastwood , &quot; but I needed Gene because he can make an unsympathetic character sympathetic. &quot; For Hackman , taking a role has to do solely with the inherent acting challenges . &quot; When I read a script and I think there is no way I can make_it come_alive , I don ' t do_it , &quot; he says simply . He is famous for crossing_off stage_directions , finding his own ways to bring angry , inarticulate guys to life . He almost quit &quot; The French Connection &quot; because he couldn ' t figure_out how to play the rage of a New York City narcotics cop . Now , on &quot; The Quick and the Dead , &quot; he is playing an almost abstract portrait of evil for the sheer pleasure of being able to do_it . &quot; I look_for something that isn ' t written_down , some behavioral kind of business that my character can relate to and makes him emotionally accessible to the audience , &quot; he says . Oh yeah , he adds , and you have to be relaxed about it . BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY , EMOTIONAL ACCESSIBILITY , RELAXATION , THESE ARE the buzzwords of a Method-trained actor . A disciple of the fabled Stanislavsky technique , Hackman as a young acting student would stand on Manhattan street_corners with Hoffman and Duvall and argue technique . &quot; We ' d get_into these huge fights about whose acting teacher was more right , &quot; recalls Hoffman . &quot; Gene was always quite stubborn about what was acting and what wasn ' t. &quot; He was adamant because , after a frustrating year trying to master the by-the-numbers approach taught at the Pasadena Playhouse , he had blossomed under George Morrison , an alumnus of the Lee Strasberg Actors Studio in New York . &quot; Gene is a brilliant character_actor , &quot; says Morrison , who currently teaches at his own school , the New Actors Workshop in Manhattan . &quot; But when he first came_to me , he was in that insecure place . He had virtually no education , couldn ' t pronounce a lot of words , and he was a little cowed by people. &quot; Morrison helped Hackman discover the usual Method tools . But his breakthrough didn ' t come , he says , until Hackman began to work in improvisational theater and Off-Broadway comedies in the early 1960s . &quot; that ' s when he learned to use his own energy. &quot; By the time Hackman appeared with Sandy Dennis in the 1964 Broadway comedy hit &quot; Any Wednesday , &quot; he had become a star , eliciting Walter Kerr ' s famous line about his &quot; wonderfully light-footed habit of stepping off a joke before it begins to complain. &quot; His transition to tough-guy roles came later , in his first films , including &quot; Lilith , &quot; where he met Beatty . Then came &quot; The French Connection , &quot; a film that frightened Hackman , according to Morrison , &quot; because he was afraid of playing his own anger. &quot; Sticking_with the role , playing through his fears and subsequently winning the Oscar , Morrison says , &quot; was the turning point for Gene. &quot; Hackman , he adds , is now &quot; way beyond technique. &quot; The only classroom habit he consciously retains : &quot; Before every shot , Gene sits in a chair and relaxes like he has done a_thousand times before. &quot; Or , as Hackman puts it now , having finished gun practice , &quot; I guess I better get_back there and concentrate a little bit. &quot; Back on the set , Hackman resumes his place in front of the camera . He is supposed to be squaring_off in a gunfight with DiCaprio , who plays his son , but the younger actor is not in the shot , and Hackman , his face a mask , stares at a sea of milling crew_members . For several minutes , Raimi shoots take_after take as Hackman scowls and draws , again and again . &quot; This is unusually technical , a lot of waiting around for minuscule things to happen , &quot; says Hackman during a break . He is clearly frustrated by the day ' s hurry-up-and-wait pace , but the delay seems to loosen something in him . While Raimi huddles with his crew , Hackman stands off to one side , breathing lightly , his leather boots squeaking as he shifts in the wind . He is almost conspiratorial , whispering even , as the conversation becomes , for a_few moments , intimate . &quot; Most people think acting is doing something overt , but that isn ' t necessarily true , &quot; he says . &quot; If you can make a character understandable , audiences perceive that as acting . To give you a for-instance , I might do a transference to my own son at a time when I was upset with him , so that would be a real thought of mine instead of some idea I had about the character . &quot; I don ' t have a big emotional bank , &quot; he adds softly . &quot; I think it ' s difficult for men ; their emotions have more layers on them , so they ' re harder to get to. &quot; He likes to keep his distance from other cast members . &quot; I think it ' s better to stay alone or at arm ' s length . You ' re more apt to be easy with someone if they ' re a friend. &quot; The same goes_for directors , he says . While he prefers to work with men of_his_own age and experience -- Pollack , Eastwood and Arthur Penn , who directed him in &quot; Bonnie and Clyde &quot; -- he says the relationship is never wholly comfortable for him . &quot; I ' m a funny guy , &quot; he says , chuckling softly . &quot; I didn ' t have much of a dad , so directors are always authority figures to me. &quot; Even when they are , like Raimi , about his son ' s age ? His chuckle deepens . &quot; I always have a little suspicion about them . It ' s sick , but . . . . &quot; &quot; Gene ? &quot; Hackman is summoned back to the camera . Instinctively , he reaches up_to adjust the brim of his hat . &quot; You have to have a certain amount of ego in filmmaking because the camera will pick_up a lack of energy quicker than almost anything . You have to get_in front of the camera and think that it ' s all about you. &quot; He gazes out at the crew , his face tightening , his eyes distant . &quot; If you ' ve done that , it ' s really hard to shift gears and be a decent person . Sometimes you just don ' t bother. &quot; BECAUSE HE IS SO TALL AND STILL MOVES WITH THE ATHLETIC GRACE OF his Marine days , Hackman tends to walk on ahead . On the set , you can spot him striding along , either alone or with somebody dogtrotting along trying to keep_up . You see a lot of his back , like now , when he leaps up the tiny aluminum steps into his trailer , some 35 minutes from being sprung for the weekend . When he emerges from the trailer bedroom a_few moments later , Hackman is dressed in his own clothes , casual trousers and V-neck sweater with a logo from the Gleneagles resort in Scotland where he recently played in a celebrity golf tournament . He seems embarrassed by this admission , that even his hobbies are the source of scrutiny . But in his pastel-hued sportswear , he seems older , less exotic , less able to hide behind his film persona . &quot; I played all_the normal things in high_school , football , track , basketball , &quot; he says , adding that in a lot of ways he takes_after his mother ' s side of the family . He was taller than his father , for one thing . And while they shared the same name , Hackman was known back in Danville as Gene Allen to distinguish him from his father , the first Eugene Hackman , a pressman at the local paper . Hackmans had staffed the Commercial News for generations ; his uncle and grandfather had been reporters , but his father didn ' t carry that kind of rank . He worked the machinery in the back_room , the hot lead needed to make the plates . &quot; My Dad dropped_out of school in the fourth grade or something like that , &quot; says Hackman . &quot; He wasn ' t very well educated. &quot; Danville was then a central Illinois border town of front_porches , local factories and neighboring farms . But even by those modest standards , the Hackman household was a poor one . The family lived with Hackman ' s maternal grandmother . There were fights , he has said , among all_the adults , and his father often took_after him with his fists . Hackman spent a lot of time in the basement , trying to find some space for himself . &quot; I would make_up this little cardboard room that would be all contained and cozy , &quot; he says . &quot; I had a little telephone_system setup with a can and a string pulled taut with the guy across the street. &quot; Saturdays , he escaped to the movies , entranced by the serials and actors like Errol Flynn and James Cagney . He identified so strongly with what he saw on screen that he was shocked to see his own face in the mirrored lobby . &quot; I would see this kid there . I would be so stunned , &quot; he recalls , &quot; because I really felt I could do what they were doing. &quot; If he treasured any dream of becoming an actor then , it would be a long_time in coming , years in which Hackman would join the Marines , nearly cripple himself in a motorcycle accident , bounce around the country on the GI Bill and try his hand at various jobs -- radio_announcer , TV cameraman . He even studied painting for a while in New York . Much of it now seems like a long , anguished prelude to the career that would eventually channel his restlessness , his anger , into art -- anger that crystallized when Hackman was barely a teen-ager , on the day his father drove by him as he was playing , gave him an odd little wave and never came_back until after Hackman himself had left home at 16 to join the Marines . &quot; I don ' t mean to belabor that , &quot; Hackman says now , &quot; but it was just a very vivid memory of him. &quot; His father had left_behind a wife with a drinking problem and two sons , 13-year-old Gene and 6-week-old Richard . &quot; Acting , &quot; says Hackman , promised the means &quot; of finding some way to get this thing inside me out , whatever it was , or is , if it ' s art or energy or whatever . that ' s all I ever thought_about and to some degree still do. &quot; He won ' t say it , but that anger has served as his artistic ballast . He was busted in the Marines for fighting , a practice that continued to dog him years later when he was getting acting jobs in New York and working part time as a mover , hauling refrigerators strapped to his back_up six flights of tenement stairs to support his first wife , Fay Maltese , and his baby son . &quot; We ' d go see a movie , get some dinner , and then Gene would stand on a corner and say , ' I gotta go , ' &quot; says Hoffman . &quot; He had to get_in a fight . He ' d go_into some bar , and the next day I ' d see him like nothing had happened. &quot; Later , when he was a successful movie_star living_in a succession of big houses in Los Angeles , he took_up expensive , risky hobbies -- racing_cars , flying airplanes . And like that kid in the basement , he would still withdraw . He took a two-year hiatus , moved to Monterey and painted in_earnest after lackluster commercial receptions to &quot; The Conversation &quot; and &quot; Scarecrow. &quot; Once , when his father , who had moved to Los Angeles and kept_in infrequent touch with his son , rode a motorcycle to Carmel to see him on the set of &quot; Zandy ' s Bride , &quot; Hackman never once spoke_to him , never came_out of his trailer . There were even worse times . The suicide of Norman Garey , his lawyer and closest friend . His own divorce , a long_time brewing . The death of his mother in a fire in 1972 , set accidentally by her own hand . She died an alcoholic in bed . Now Hackman will only speak about his children , the guilt of having worked so_much and so far from home all those years . &quot; That was selfish and unfair , &quot; he says . &quot; But at this point there is nothing I can do about that. &quot; About the rest of it , his mother and father , his divorce , he is silent . &quot; Gene ' s dealt with some of his past , &quot; says one longtime friend . &quot; But not all_of it. &quot; Some of those close to him think Hackman has finally found in his career a measure of peace , not only as an actor and an artist but also as a man who has unconsciously replicated his father ' s own peripatetic life . &quot; Acting , &quot; says Morrison , &quot; is Gene ' s way of being with others and yet still being alone. &quot; That may explain Hackman ' s ambivalence about working as much as he does . &quot; We ' re trained as actors , and maybe that ' s what we should think in terms of , that there is no retirement , &quot; he says . &quot; But I really think it ' s time for me to stop . Films take so_much out of you. &quot; Hackman lets his voice trail off . It is near the end of the last lunch conversation he has agreed to . When he confesses he wants to get his hands on a &quot; serious sailboat , &quot; it doesn ' t come as much of a surprise . Just so_long as there is no crew . He did that once , on his first boat , a trip to the Bahamas . &quot; The crew was sitting around drinking beer and having a great time , &quot; he says . &quot; They were nice guys and all that , but it was not what I wanted to do. &quot; So he will go alone , and you can picture Hackman that way : a solitary figure on his deck , content finally , unreachable .</TEXT>
