   <HEADLINE> THE FINE_ART OF MARIACHI ; POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; FIFTH ANNUAL FESTIVAL CELEBRATES BOLERO TRADITION , FEMALE MUSICIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Can &quot; Mariachi USA &quot; and the mariachis themselves get any better than this ? Saturday ' s masterful production at the Hollywood Bowl demonstrated that those involved with the annual event keep rising to the occasion and taking mariachi music to new heights . Marking its fifth year , the festival has expanded to two nights , and on Saturday the near-capacity audience witnessed a nonstop , spectacular display of a music that is increasingly being treated as a fine_art rather than easy-to-digest music for the masses . Musically , the show was more romantically oriented than previous more festive editions , but it wasn ' t more mellow . In an ambitious tribute to the golden era of Mexico ' s bolero trios of the 1940s and ' 50s , an army of musicians from all_of the show ' s participating mariachis joined the Mariachi USA Symphony and the MUSA Ballet . Preceding that bolero set came Mariachi Sol de Mexico , led by the festival ' s musical director , Jose Hernandez , and clearly the crowd ' s favorite . Confirming its unofficial status as the finest mariachi in the United States , Sol de Mexico offered another impressive performance . Typifying its experimental approach , the group did its mandatory rendition of &quot; New York , New York , &quot; and , in the spirit of the last year ' s rap segment , featured a group member dancing like a poor-man ' s John Travolta , moonwalking like Michael Jackson and duck-stepping like Chuck Berry . Hardly pure mariachi , but the joke was short enough to not further antagonize the traditionalists who claim that Hernandez goes too far and endangers the essence of mariachi . But the most interesting part of &quot; Mariachi USA ' 94 &quot; was the singers , who could easily support a whole separate festival . Saturday ' s show was a seedbed of potential ranchera stars , starting with the Mariachi Heritage Society students , whose Rosalva Lepe , 14 ; sister Ana Maria , 10 , and high-pitched brother Jose Luis , 6 , earned the evening ' s first standing_ovation . The Long_Beach threesome indicated that mariachi is going_to stay around for a while . Well-regarded Monica Trevino , a singer and violinist for Mariachi Los Camperos , made a successful solo singing debut backed by Orange County ' s Mariachi Tlaquepaque . Acclaimed ranchera singer Aida Cuevas , backed by Mariachi America , stopped the show with a ranchera medley that left the sense that &quot; The Voice of Mexico &quot; might be at her peak . In fact , &quot; MUSA ' 94 &quot; had an unusually strong female flavor . Besides Trevino and Cuevas , the powerful all-female Mariachi La Reyna de Los Angeles boldly destroyed the notion that women have no place in the mariachi world . Showing confidence , skills and aggressiveness , theirs was the best performance by a female orchestra in recent memory .</TEXT>
