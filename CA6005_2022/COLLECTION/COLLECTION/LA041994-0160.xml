   <HEADLINE> U.S. EXAMINING MOTOROLA SALES OF LICENSES FOR WIRELESS LINKS ; TELECOM : REVIEW BY JUSTICE_DEPARTMENT PUTS DEALS ON HOLD . TECHNOLOGY WOULD COMPETE WITH CELLULAR PHONES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department is reviewing Motorola Inc. ' s proposed sale of radio licenses to buyers seeking to build a wireless network to rival the cellular_phone industry ' s . The move is the latest in a recent series of government and court actions that have slowed the race toward consolidation in telecommunications . The Justice_Department has asked_for details on more_than $ 2 billion worth of pending mergers that would transfer so-called specialized mobile radio ( SMR ) licenses , a digital , wireless_telephone technology that uses a portion of the airwaves now employed mainly by taxi dispatchers . Last fall , Motorola -- a major chip maker and the leading manufacturer of hand-held SMR transceivers -- agreed to sell scores of its SMR licenses to Nextel , CenCall Communications Corp . and Dial Page Inc. in exchange for stock . The Justice_Department would not comment on its probe , but a Nextel official and a former Justice_Department lawyer said it is concerned that the deals might give Motorola too_much control over the nascent SMR industry . Motorola would have major equity stakes in the three major SMR providers , and the three companies are expected to buy billions of dollars ' worth of equipment that uses Motorola ' s SMR technology . The transactions are being watched closely because they would increase competition with the fast-growing cellular_phone network by speeding the introduction of digital wireless phone_services . SMR phones , now offered in Los Angeles by Nextel , can convert voice and other communications into numerical codes with less distortion and much greater capacity than the analog telecommunications_systems now in_use . Robert Foosaner , Nextel ' s vice_president of government relations , said Justice_Department lawyers have twice requested information from his company , but he said they gave no indication that the deal with Motorola is in jeopardy . &quot; Whenever you have an acquisition of any size , you hear from the Justice_Department , &quot; Foosaner said . &quot; While they ' ve asked_for information and made an inquiry , our response , so far , seems to have been satisfactory. &quot; The news , however , did not torpedo CenCall , Nextel or Dial Page on Wall_Street . Nextel was unchanged at $ 35 a share , CenCall fell 75 cents to $ 23.25 , and Dial Page lost 12.5 cents , closing at $ 33 . The overall market fell sharply . Still , &quot; this is pretty serious business , &quot; said Charles A . DiSanza , an analyst at Gerard Klauer , Mattison &amp; Co.. He was one of several analysts who said a Justice_Department review would have a chilling effect on investors ' interest in SMR technology . &quot; If , for some reason , these acquisitions are not permitted , then it would not be possible for these companies to put_together a sufficient number of channels to compete against cellular , &quot; DiSanza added . The ex-Justice Department lawyer , who has closely followed the review of the deals , said that if the transactions are found to present antitrust problems , the agency could require restructuring some of the deals or ask that Motorola license its technology to all comers. &quot;</TEXT>
