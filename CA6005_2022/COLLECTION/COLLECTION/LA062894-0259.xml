   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN ANTI-CRIME DECREE PUT INTO EFFECT -- SORT OF ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : YELTSIN GIVES POLICE NEW POWER . BUT SOME OFFICERS AREN ' T SURE WHAT TO DO WITH IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No flashy raids or mass arrests were reported , but Russia entered a new regime Monday -- the tougher new order dictated by President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s controversial decree cracking_down on organized_crime . From now on , Russian police on the trail of certain crimes have the authority to detain suspects for up_to 30 days without bringing charges , search vehicles and offices without a warrant and inspect bank records without a court_order . Russia ' s rocketing crime_rate and widespread corruption have become devastating political liabilities for Yeltsin , second only to the ravaged economy in the Russian people ' s litany of reform-era grievances . In popular perception , the &quot; mafia &quot; is taking_over much of the country , the streets are unsafe and officialdom is all on the take . The thirst for law-and-order measures contributes to mass support for ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who backs the creation of summary courts with the power to execute &quot; bandits &quot; on the spot . After months of pledges to fight crime and ineffective commission work , Yeltsin finally issued what is known as the &quot; anti-banditry &quot; decree June 12 -- only to be confronted by a wave of political opposition and complaints that the decree would violate Russians ' rights . Police and the Kremlin have responded with a public relations campaign touting the decree as simply a way of making the procedural nuts_and_bolts of crime-fighting easier . They assure Russians that there will be no human_rights abuses . &quot; The start of the decree won ' t come_with fireworks , &quot; Mikhail Yegorov , head of the Russian police ' s department on organized_crime , told reporters recently . In fact , in classic post-Soviet fashion , the decree ' s first day in_effect began not with fireworks but with confusion . Vladimir Kolokoltsev , chief of the 108th Police_Precinct in the very center of Moscow , said he had heard about the measure on the radio Monday but had yet to receive instructions on how to implement it . A worker at the Interior Ministry press center at first said , &quot; Decree ? What decree ? &quot; when asked about its first day in action , then a colleague recalled that they had spent much of the day making copies of it to be distributed to local police_stations . Yevgeny Ryabtsev , director of the press center , said police are working_on &quot; a special schedule for our staff to cover the most criminal places , &quot; in tandem with counterintelligence agents , Interior Ministry troops and prosecutors . He hastened to add , however , that the decree would not mean &quot; a roundup of all_of Russia. &quot; Police are under extra pressure to use the decree to good effect in the wake of their embarrassing performance last week in a sweep of organized-crime haunts dubbed the &quot; Hurricane &quot; operation . According to Moscow media , leaks gave the mobsters plenty of time to clear_out well in_advance , leaving police largely empty-handed . Authorities here , though , are also under pressure to avoid abusing their new powers , particularly because any complaints of unfounded harassment and arrests will play directly into the hands of Yeltsin ' s opponents . In a rare harmony among Communist , nationalist and reformist lawmakers , all three voted to ask Yeltsin to rescind the decree last week . Yeltsin responded with a stubborn , simple nyet , and his chief_of_staff , Sergei A . Filatov , said Monday that he is convinced the Russian president has the public ' s support for the crackdown . Yegorov assured the public that the new police powers will apply only to those suspected of serious crimes , such_as murder and extortion . While much of the Russian public may know that it wants an offensive on crime , many here appear to have little knowledge of Yeltsin ' s decree . The latest poll by the independent Institute of the Sociology of Parliamentarism showed that 59 % of 1 # 000 Muscovites surveyed had not heard of the decree or had only vaguely &quot; heard something about it. &quot; A total of 33 % said they thought it should be carried_out , 10 % were against it , and 57 % could not say either way .</TEXT>
