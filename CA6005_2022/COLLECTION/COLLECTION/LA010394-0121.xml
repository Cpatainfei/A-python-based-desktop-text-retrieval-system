   <HEADLINE> INDIA AND PAKISTAN MEET OVER KASHMIR DISPUTE ; SOUTH ASIA : NATIONS RESUME CONTACTS FOR FIRST TIME IN 16 MONTHS . THERE IS LITTLE OPTIMISM THEY CAN RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES OVER THE BORDER TERRITORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> India and Pakistan , suspicious neighbors who have fought three wars since independence , met Sunday for the first time in 16 months to see if they could narrow their acrimonious differences over the border territory of Kashmir . &quot; One object of my visit is to check_out whether it is the last chance , &quot; Indian Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit , head of his country ' s five-member delegation , told reporters after arriving in Islamabad . The Indian press reported that Dixit is carrying a proposal to make the &quot; line of control &quot; separating Indian- and Pakistani-held parts of Kashmir into an international border , plus assurances that India will grant its share of the mountainous territory greater autonomy . After the first round of talks , however , the Pakistanis ' chief conclusion was that the Indians had nothing new_to offer . &quot; The reports trickling out of the Foreign Office say that , in sum , the Indians have belied the impression that they would come_up with a new formula , &quot; Syed Talat Hussain , assistant editor of the News , an Islamabad daily , said by telephone . &quot; Both sides reiterated known positions. &quot; The first round of discussions , between Dixit and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shahryar Khan , lasted about an hour and a half Sunday . Dixit then left by plane for Karachi to see Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto . During their meeting , Bhutto challenged India to &quot; take visible steps &quot; to end the widespread brutalities that international and local watchdog groups have accused Indian forces of committing in their battle against Kashmiri separatists . Dixit , expressing hope that Indo-Pakistani ties would improve markedly as a result of the resumed contacts , gave Bhutto a letter from Indian Prime_Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao , but the contents were not disclosed , reports from Karachi said . Today , Dixit is to meet with Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali , the Pakistani foreign_minister . The Pakistanis , who originally spoke hopefully about the negotiations , had become gloomier as the talks neared . Bhutto said she was &quot; not very optimistic &quot; about a breakthrough , and other officials charged India with stepping_up repression in Kashmir . &quot; There is nothing to feel optimistic about -- killings are going_on , villages are being torched , women are being raped ( and ) deaths taking_place , &quot; Pakistan ' s Ali declared on New Year ' s Eve . After a gap in the dialogue at foreign secretary level since August , 1992 , the Islamabad talks mark the first time that Kashmir , the chief bone of contention in Indo-Pakistani relations , has been a specific agenda topic . Pressure to negotiate from the United States , Britain and other countries has been considerable . The Western countries are worried about India ' s and Pakistan ' s suspected attempts to build or acquire nuclear_weapons and ground-to-ground missiles . An insurgency in the Indian-controlled state of Jammu and Kashmir is now entering its fourth year ; India has waged a campaign of brutal repression in reply . The unofficial toll runs as high as 20 # 000 deaths , mostly of civilians . &quot; Making people disappear . . . extrajudicial executions , death in custody , all this stuff , frankly there is no excuse for , &quot; Assistant Secretary_of_State Robin Raphael said last October . She also shocked Indians by saying the Clinton_Administration considers Kashmir a &quot; disputed territory &quot; that may_not necessarily be part of India forever . Many Pakistanis believe that the Indians are only going_through the motions of negotiating as a public relations exercise . As for the Indians , they believe that the Pakistanis will insist on some major proposal , such_as a referendum so that the 7.7 million inhabitants of Jammu and Kashmir can determine their own fate . But New Delhi ' s foreign_policy Establishment has made_it clear that the sovereignty of the Indian state is not negotiable . The forgotten party to the negotiations seems to be the Kashmiris themselves , many of whom prefer independence . On the eve of Dixit ' s arrival , Indian authorities said Kashmiri militants detonated 14 bombs in the state ' s Doda district to protest the Indo-Pakistani talks and sow panic . BACKGROUND The historical root of the Kashmir dispute dates to the agony-filled period of August-October , 1947 , and the partition of British India . The fate of the princely states was to be determined according to their rulers ' wish , the will of their populace and geography . Maharajah Hari Singh of Kashmir , a Hindu , had dreamed of independence for the &quot; Switzerland of Asia , &quot; but as Pakistani troops poured into the northern and eastern parts of his domain , he signed the Instrument of Accession to India , despite the fact that a majority of his subjects were Muslim . India and Pakistan fought two of their three wars over control of Kashmir , and their soldiers still face_off across the Siachen Glacier 20 # 000 feet above sea_level in the Himalayas .</TEXT>
