   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; THE ' 94 LILLEHAMMER GAMES PROVIDED SO MANY MEMORIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The old_man with a devil ' s chin whiskers , Maurilio de Zolt , is an Italian cross-country skier who at 43 trains on wine and cheese , bread and wine , everything accompanied by wine . &quot; It is difficult to say how many glasses of wine I had , and if I knew I ' d rather not say it here , &quot; he says , an eyebrow raised , &quot; because I ' d probably get_in trouble with my associations. &quot; Which prompts memory of Jean-Claude Killy ' s line at Grenoble in 1968 when the Frenchman won three gold medals and defended his training regimen by saying , &quot; Would you rather I not drink wine -- and ski like an American ? &quot; The last_day of the Lillehammer Olympics , Maurilio de Zolt was seen with frost and ice clinging_to his beard as billows of chilled breath preceded him through the forest that was the scene of the 50-kilometer race , the classic event of the wintry games . Spectators by the tens of thousands lined the route , most waving Norway ' s red flag with the blue cross , children sitting in snowdrifts atop houses , everyone loving these moments that tell us the improbable is yet the possible . Improbable that a bobsled would slide on Lillehammer ' s ice under Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s flag ? And that it would carry four men , a Serb and a Croatian sitting around two Muslims ? Here they were with brakeman Igor Boras saying , &quot; Ten years ago , when we staged the Winter_Olympics , Sarajevo was a paradise on earth for us . But it was blood red and a living hell when I left this time . We are showing to the Bosnian people and the world that we can live together. &quot; We will forget Tonya Harding as we forget all those who choose to betray their gift of talent . We will remember the Bosnians as we remember the old iceman , de Zolt , who chose to pursue excellence across mountains in three Olympics and finally won a medal , a gold as the leadoff man for Italy ' s 30-kilometer relayers . It is de Zolt of whom the Norwegian hero Bjorn Dahlie says , &quot; I was impressed by him at the 1992 Olympics because , even then , he was old enough to be my father . No , I do not think I will ski that fast when I am 43 years old. &quot; We will remember the moments when these Olympics gave substance to words spoken in a Lillehammer house above frozen Lake Mjosa . The Russians rented the place with Reebok shoe money , apprentice capitalists learning from the masters . They laid on caviar in a room decorated with peasant shirts and silver samovars . There , the president of the Russian Olympic Committee , Vitali Smirnov , says sport is important : &quot; It gives us optimism. &quot; As we leave the Russians ' house , an American reporter says , &quot; You don ' t believe anything that fat old souse said , do you ? &quot; In fact , yes . Granted , the Russian boss is a propagandist for his own well-being . Maybe he calls sport a source of optimism to justify his privileged life in a poor country so beleaguered that its existence is subject daily to whims of warriors , politicians and other madmen . None of which changes the truth of what Smirnov says about sport . Anyone reaching for the stars lifts us all . Even the morning after the massacre of Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Olympics in Munich , a Japanese coach said the games should go_on . &quot; There is more good here , &quot; he said , &quot; than criminals can erase. &quot; From these Norway games , we will remember Yi Qiabo , the star-crossed Chinese speedskater who , 28 years old with a bad knee , finished third to Bonnie Blair in the women ' s 1000 meters and then , crying , says she cried not because of her knee but because she realized she would never skate in another Olympics . &quot; I feel very pain , &quot; Yi says , &quot; and I could not do my best on the last turn of my whole life. &quot; One last turn , or as American skier Diann Roffe-Steinrotter says , &quot; The Olympics is one day , one hill , 1 1 / 2 minutes . Whoever shakes and bakes the best is going_to get a gold medal. &quot; One turn , one hill , a life ' s work , the best of us reaching for the stars . And we will remember , always , Dan Jansen gliding in the starlight , his baby girl in his arms . Johann Olav Koss is a Norwegian speedskating hero who set a world_record in the 10 # 000 meters that may stand_for half a century . He also won two other gold medals and there is talk_of preserving his 1994 likeness in a statue that would grace the Viking Ship hall where he did his wonders . In his moment of victory , Koss announced what he would do with the $ 30 # 000 awarded him by Norway ' s Olympic committee . He would send it to Sarajevo , where the need for money is desperate . Perhaps other athletes made private donations . Of Americans , only Bonnie Blair revealed hers . She would give $ 5 # 000 . Two seats away at a press_conference , the new American millionaire Nancy Kerrigan did a recital of her soup contracts , shoe deals and sunglasses agreements before ending with a giggle . &quot; So many , &quot; she says . She offered the Sarajevans nothing . we ' ll remember Kerrigan in her golden glittery outfit on the night of her life . She skated as well as she can , good_enough for a silver medal behind the Ukraine waif , Oksana Bayul , an orphan , only 16 , a survivor of tragedies not to be confused with the inconveniences of a knee that is sore to the touch . we ' ll remember Oksana Bayul ' s face when she first saw scores that celebrated her performance , scores that confirmed the reality of the improbable . Her face became a mask of tears . we ' ll remember that her sorrow was not so far away that she could forget it in her moment of joy .</TEXT>
