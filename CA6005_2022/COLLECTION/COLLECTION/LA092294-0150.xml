   <TEXT> Anne Hollander is mad about suits . Other people may dismiss them as dreary symbols of conformity , the predictable retreat of the terminally unimaginative . Not Hollander . In her new apologia , &quot; Sex and Suits &quot; ( Alfred A . Knopf ) , the art critic contends that the suit is nothing less than an aesthetic triumph , a grand design that continues to please hundreds of years after its invention . In Hollander ' s besotted view , the tailor does what the personal trainer may_not be able to : make every man look_like a hero -- wide of shoulder , narrow of hip , noble , rational , modern and , above all , sexy . As Hollander explained in an interview from her home_in New York City , she has always been an admirer of a properly cut suit , even the widely vilified pin-striped , three-piece kind . As a student at the Cleveland School of Art in the late 1940s , she learned to love the way well-tailored clothing seemed to give men a second , better skin . &quot; Among the persons in clothes I couldn ' t get enough of , &quot; she said , &quot; were men in suits. &quot; Her colleagues may have been gaga for the nude , but the young Hollander always understood the erotic superiority of the clothed , especially the suited , male . She relished the look of a clad arm flung over a chair , the sinuous line of a trousered leg , the way a flexed knee caused good wool to drape . &quot; I did hundreds of drawings of men making . . . wonderful wrinkles , &quot; she recalled . The ancient ancestor of the modern suit was the suit_of_armor , Hollander explained . Until early in this century , women wore clothes that denied the reality of their bodies . They have been segmented like wasps , turned_into facsimiles of sailing_ships by billowing skirts , had their breasts rearranged , even flattened_out of visual existence . At times men ' s bodies have also been disguised , but at some point late in the 16th Century , men invented for themselves the ideal garment , one that enveloped the body but visually enhanced it in the process , suggesting all_the wonders that were underneath the costume without emphasizing the inevitable flaws . The suit , the glorious suit , was born . * Despite its titillating title , Hollander ' s book is really the story of the evolution of modern dress , the subtitle of the book . You can ' t talk_about fashion , Hollander said , without talking_about both men and women . Western fashion has always been about the interaction of the sexes , and the suit is no exception . It never existed in a gender vacuum , she said . Whether or not you accept her theses , much of the pleasure of reading her book is in the factoids . Hollander tosses_out wonderful tidbits about that vastly interesting subject of what we wear to rip_out the hearts of the people we want to go_to_bed with . She tells us that the parts of early suits rarely matched , for instance , and that those in which jacket , trousers and vest were all made of the same fabric were known as &quot; a suit of dittoes. &quot; She also disseminates information previously known only to &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; champions , such_as the fact that the tape_measure was invented circa 1820 for the sole purpose of advancing the nascent ready-to-wear industry . Like Hollander ' s landmark 1975 study , &quot; Seeing Through Clothes , &quot; the new book reflects her conviction that pictures -- paintings , movies , even MTV -- have always influenced how we view ourselves . &quot; This is one of the foundations of Western civilization , &quot; she said , a perceptual truth that dates to the ancient_Greeks . &quot; We need realistic representations to believe_in our own existence. &quot; It is no accident , she said , that the mirror is framed , just as a picture is . &quot; We invented the mirror to help ourselves measure_up . We put something like a picture in there and try to resemble it. &quot; The picture of what we want to look_like precedes the reality : &quot; that ' s why we frown when we look in the mirror. &quot; Fashion is an art , not a designers ' plot , Hollander said , one that has been linked with the other visual arts for millennia . Our politics and economic views may influence how we regard what we and other people wear , but the pleasure we take_in fashion -- our lust for certain garments and a certain look -- is determined largely by an internalized aesthetic shaped by paintings , advertising art and other pictures . In Hollander ' s view , images of model Claudia Schiffer loom larger in the scheme of things fashionable than whether interest_rates rise or fall or whether American values are leaning left or right . Art matters , she insisted . &quot; People look_at each other with such things in their mind ' s eye . This I believe. &quot; * Hollander ' s conviction that art and clothing have intimate ties was confirmed by her study of art history . The serious student of costume must study art if he or she wants to appreciate clothes in their context , she said . &quot; In order to study the history of clothing , you are absolutely in bed with the history of art . You ' re not going_to get anywhere looking_at surviving shreds. &quot; Evidence of the durability of suits -- a term Hollander uses as shorthand for all_of tailored menswear -- is the eagerness with which women appropriated them . She is not surprised that the 20th Century has seen the closing of the traditional Great Divide between women ' s clothes and men ' s , not just in the flourishing of masculine-inspired couture by Coco Chanel and others but in such ad_hoc proof as the universal swiping of boyfriends ' shirts . Suits have an eternally flattering &quot; abstracting quality , &quot; she said . &quot; Look what they do for men. &quot; How does the suit work this potent magic ? &quot; It only refers to what is under it . It doesn ' t outline what ' s under it. &quot; Hollander is rhapsodic on the superiority of suits . Consider the bad old days when women teetered on high heels , under headdresses that looked_like chandeliers , steering skirts the size of small buildings . &quot; You didn ' t have your body at all , &quot; she lamented . &quot; You were an upholstered sofa in Shakespearean times . And now here you have the nude body made_out of wool. &quot; In a suit , she said , &quot; You are a work_of_art as you walk around. &quot; Specifically , you are a work of modern art , all pleasing planes harmoniously arranged . Most important , she noted , &quot; You are also a work of sex. &quot; In her view , the suit is the perfect uniform for the scrimmage of appetite . And yes , she wears them , although she also likes very feminine clothes because of her full bust and small waist . * Many men admit that they love their suits , but they often have nothing but vile things to say about its common complement , the tie . Hollander will have none of this talk_about the tie as the work of the Antichrist . She conceded that for some the tie &quot; suggests oppression , repression , suppression , depression and constriction. &quot; But stop your whining , she said , and appreciate the tie_in all its phallic splendor . &quot; The tie is the great flourish and marvel that finishes_off the suit , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s the perfect accent under the face and above the bod. &quot; She has no sympathy with people who hate them . The ability to appreciate cultural resonance is evidence of one ' s humanity , she said , &quot; and the ability to overcome discomfort shows you are a grown-up. &quot; One of the glories of the tie , she added , is that it has no real purpose . &quot; It ' s all pure pleasure. &quot; And it is most definitely not the work of the_devil : &quot; It ' s the work of Mercury , which all fashion is -- the god of swift changes. &quot;</TEXT>
