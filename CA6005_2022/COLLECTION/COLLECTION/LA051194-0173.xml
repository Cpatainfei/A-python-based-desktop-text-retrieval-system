   <HEADLINE> MILLIONS MAY BE MISSING FROM FIRST PENSION CORP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Authorities investigating the bankruptcy of an Orange County pension management firm are looking_into whether as much as $ 100 million in client funds may have been lost or misappropriated , according to law_enforcement sources and others close to the case . The firm is Irvine-based First Pension Corp. , which filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on April 22 . That happened as scores of the firm ' s estimated 8 # 000 clients -- individuals and small-business operators from across Southern California -- discovered that large sums were missing from their accounts or that interest or dividend checks they were expecting from the firm were overdue , according to clients , employees and lawyers close to the case . Some checks mailed by clients to First Pension may have been cashed illicitly by people connected with the firm and the money misappropriated , investigators said . Money belonging_to investors may also have been spirited overseas , they added . &quot; We don ' t know where a substantial amount of cash is presently located , &quot; said Andrew C . Snyder , a court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust Co. , a Colorado firm affiliated with First Pension that functioned as custodian of money sent by clients to the Irvine firm . Summit Trust was seized by Colorado regulators and its accounts were frozen a day before First Pension ' s bankruptcy filing . First Pension was one of several companies jointly owned by William E . Cooper , a politically well-connected Orange County real_estate investor , and two associates , Valerie Jensen and Robert Lindley . None could be reached for comment , but their lawyers said each was intent_on cooperating with the authorities investigating the case . Since First Pension ' s bankruptcy filing , the FBI and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have opened investigations of the firm and the three owners . First Pension served its clients by handling the administration of retirement accounts , including Individual_Retirement_Accounts and Keogh accounts through which they could make their own investment choices instead of leaving the management to banks or mutual_funds . In practice , many of First Pension ' s clients ended_up placing their money in real_estate investment pools offered by its sister companies . Cooper , Jensen , and Lindley were also principals of Summit Trust , which handled the cash that First Pension clients were funneling into their retirement accounts . That means that First Pension was the conduit for the money coming_in from investors as well as going_out to them -- that is , money they were investing in their retirement as well as income from some of the same investments . Snyder said questions exist over the fate of as much as $ 35 million held by Summit Trust on behalf of First Pension clients . A significant portion of that sum remains unaccounted for , he said . Other authorities are investigating whether as much as $ 25 million of the money may have gone astray as early as December , when First Pension transferred its custodial_accounts -- money being held for clients pending their investment decisions -- to the newly established Summit Trust from a number of Orange County banks . Investigators are looking_into whether the accounting of the transfer might have masked fund diversions for months . Questions also exist over the real value of more_than $ 62 million in investments made by First Pension clients in real_estate mortgage pools offered by the sister firms , according to officials investigating the company . &quot; A number of these were put into second or third trust_deeds ( mortgages ) , &quot; said an attorney close to the case . &quot; With the beating in the real_estate market going_back to the 1980s , underlying mortgages and financial instruments started to weaken . Loans went_into default , so the value of the partnerships declined. &quot; The FBI and SEC are investigating whether the money may have been diverted from the accounts to maintain dividend payments to investors in the real_estate pools . Such diversions might have been aimed at covering_up extensive defaults among the mortgages making_up the pools , one lawyer close to the case said . Although Cooper , Jensen , and Lindley were all unavailable for comment on the allegations , Milan Smith , an attorney for First Pension , acknowledged that cash-flow problems developed among the trust_deed pools . &quot; What was done to deal with the cash-flow problem is enough of a concern that all three principals ( of First Pension ) have retained criminal counsel , &quot; he said . Another attorney close to the case , who wished to remain unidentified , confirmed that &quot; the root of the problem was the declining real_estate market and the deteriorating portfolio of loans . There was a shortfall of funds . Once there ' s a shortfall , errors of judgment can be made that compound the problem. &quot; Smith said the three principals maintain that the amount_of_money missing is considerably less than $ 100 million -- and even less than the $ 10 million that Snyder initially contended was missing . He also said they vehemently deny that any money was sent overseas , as Snyder also contended . Lawyers for all three principals said they are intent_on cooperating with authorities to maximize the recovery of funds to the customers . Investigators and the court-appointed receivers for Summit Trust and First Pension also emphasized that a conclusive loss figure must await thorough audits of the complex network of firms and investment partnerships involved . The actual loss may prove to be substantially less than the $ 100 million at risk , they said . &quot; It ' s a rather complicated situation , &quot; said Smith , who added that &quot; all_the firm ' s records are intact and in the hands of the SEC or the FBI. &quot; Snyder and others noted that many of First Pension ' s clients funneled their money into garden-variety certificates_of_deposit , mutual_funds or securities investments . That money , the receivers say , appears to be intact , although the accounts will remain frozen until completion of an audit . The total amount of investor funds is roughly $ 350 million . First Pension ' s bankruptcy capped a bizarre sequence of events that began April 5 with the abrupt resignation of Jensen as president and her replacement by Cooper , who previously had rarely appeared at the firm ' s office . Before that point , there had been few , if any , evident problems with First Pension ' s accounting . But about that time -- a period when tax deadlines mean that the flow of money into retirement accounts is at its peak for the year -- several clients complained that money they sent to First Pension had not been credited to their accounts . The discovery often came only when they asked to have specific cash sums transferred from a custodial_account at the firm to a final investment and were informed that insufficient funds existed to make the transfer . In some cases , according to clients , employees and investigators , checks mailed by clients and made_out to Summit Trust were cashed and deposited in bank_accounts elsewhere . One such client was Bruce Nelson , a Mission Viejo insurance_agent who on March 30 mailed a check for $ 20 # 000 to Summit Trust to fund his Keogh account , which already held more_than $ 5 # 000 . On April 4 , he wrote First Pension to direct that the combined sum be transferred to his brokerage_account at Fidelity Investments . About a week later , he said , a First Pension representative called_back to tell him the firm had never received the $ 20 # 000 check . &quot; I called my bank to see what happened and they sent a copy of the check showing it had been cashed , &quot; Nelson said . The check had an endorsement indicating that it had been deposited not at Summit Trust , but in an account at_Home Bank in Irvine . Home Bank officers confirm that the Irvine branch held an account in the name of Summit Trust , but would not comment further . Nelson said that he was subsequently assured by First Pension that his money would be transferred to Fidelity . The firm sent Fidelity a check for $ 25 # 011 on April 25 , but it bounced , he said . Nelson ' s queries about his check eventually made their way to officers of Summit Trust , along with similar complaints from other customers . &quot; That raised our concern , &quot; said Snyder , the Summit receiver . He said First Interstate Bank , which held Summit ' s deposits , also notified Summit that checks drawn_on the trust_company ' s account were being issued suspiciously out of sequence . Snyder said there were also indications that a signature stamp used to endorse Summit transactions &quot; was being used without our authorization. &quot; All of the questions together &quot; led us to take certain actions that led to the downfall of First Pension , &quot; he said . Those actions included Summit ' s alerting Colorado banking authorities that money under its custodianship might have been misappropriated . The state responded by seizing Summit and freezing its assets on April 21 . One day later First Pension filed for bankruptcy . Times staff writer James S . Granelli in Orange County contributed to this story .
