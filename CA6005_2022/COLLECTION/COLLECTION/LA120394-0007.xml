   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO DROP RECALL PROBE OF GM TRUCKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unprecedented settlement decried by consumer activists , the U.S._government agreed Friday to drop a recall investigation of 5 million General Motors pickup_trucks in exchange for a $ 51-million contribution from the company for safety programs . Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena said he would abandon his earlier ruling that GM ' s 1973-87 C / K pickup_trucks had a safety defect because the agreement would avoid costly litigation and enhance safety programs that could immediately save lives . &quot; This settlement is a common_sense outcome and a victory for safety , &quot; Pena said at a news_conference in Washington . But consumer groups , which prompted the government ' s safety investigation of the vehicles in 1992 , harshly criticized the agreement as &quot; unprincipled and irresponsible. &quot; &quot; A multibillion-dollar conglomerate has essentially bought the government ' s silence for a pittance , &quot; said Joan Claybrook , president of Public Citizen and a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under President Jimmy_Carter . She said her group and the Center for Auto Safety , another consumer advocacy group , is considering challenging the agreement in court on behalf of crash victims and their families . Pena ' s announcement was a surprising twist in an increasingly bitter and emotional battle over the pickups ' safety that began in 1992 . It came just four days before a NHTSA public meeting on a potential recall , which could have been the largest and most expensive in the nation ' s history . The meeting was canceled . On Oct . 17 , Pena made an initial ruling that GM pickups were defective and presented an &quot; unreasonable risk &quot; to consumers because their design made them more susceptible to fires in side-impact collisions . The vehicle ' s fuel tanks are mounted on the side outside the protective frame . GM has adamantly maintained that the C / K pickups , sold under Chevrolet and GMC nameplates , are safe and meet all federal safety standards , including those for side-impact collisions . The pickups also have a better overall safety record than most passenger_cars , company and government officials said . &quot; Our position has never wavered that these trucks are not unsafe and do not pose an unreasonable risk to owners who continue to operate them , &quot; said GM spokesman Ed Lechtzin . A recall could have cost GM more_than $ 1 billion , and the company had vowed to fight the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary . Pena said the settlement was the best option presented to him . If a recall was ordered , the_matter would have gone_to court and the vehicles would have remained on_the_road until the case was resolved in five to seven years , he said . If the case was closed , the public would have gotten no benefit . &quot; Given the options , I decided this kind of agreement was most in the best interest of the public , &quot; Pena said . Pena termed the settlement unique , and safety experts said there has been no other case in which federal regulators had agreed to vacate a recall investigation in return for a corporate donation and cooperation in unrelated safety activities . The agreement , which was signed by Pena and GM Chief_Executive John F . Smith , requires the auto_maker to contribute $ 51 million to a variety of programs identified by NHTSA . The contribution can be in the form of money , facilities or labor , but must be new expenditures not already budgeted by GM . The agreement calls_for GM to cooperate in developing stronger federal side-impact collision standards for fuel_systems . The current standard requires gas_tanks to withstand a 20 m.p.h. crash . The government would like the threshold doubled to 40 m.p.h. to better mirror real-world conditions . The auto_maker also will help fund a government fire safety research laboratory , contribute to research for burn and trauma victims , crash tests dummies and drunk-driving , and expend $ 8 million for child-safety seats for low-income families . &quot; These programs will save hundreds of lives and prevent thousands of injuries , &quot; said Pena . In making his initial determination of defect , Pena said 150 people had died in fiery collisions in the C / K pickups and 32 more would die in subsequent years . He said GM had made a design decision placing &quot; sales over safety. &quot; Although the company altered the design in 1988 , placing the gas_tank within the body frame , Pena said there was evidence that GM knew of the problem in the early 1970s . Pena ' s initial recall decision came under_fire in recent weeks when it was revealed that it was made against the recommendation of NHTSA ' s technical staff . Charles Gauthier , former director of NHTSA ' s office of defect investigation , said the staff found the C / K pickups do have a greater risk of fire-related fatalities when compared to other similar trucks -- but not an &quot; unreasonable risk &quot; when compared to all cars and trucks . &quot; We recommended that the defect investigation be closed , &quot; said Gauthier , who recently retired after 21 years with NHTSA . He added that the staff then was taken_out of the loop and the decision was placed in the hands of political appointees . The Big Three and foreign auto_makers complained about the initial recall decision in letters to President Clinton , asking him to intervene . Pena said that he advised the Administration of Friday ' s settlement but had no other contact with the White_House regarding the decision . NHTSA began an investigation in December , 1992 , shortly after the &quot; Dateline NBC &quot; news_program aired a critical show that purported to show GM pickups erupting into flames when hit in the side . But GM proved that NBC rigged the crash tests and the network retracted the story . In early 1993 , the company was rocked when a Georgia jury awarded $ 105 million to the parents of 17-year-old Shannon Moseley , who died when his C / K pickup burst into flames after being hit in the side . An appeals court overturned the decision in June and sent it back to the lower court for retrial . GM faces more_than 50 product-liability cases involving fire-related deaths and injuries in C / K pickups . It feared that the Dec . 6 public meeting would have provided a podium for trial_lawyers to parade burn victims before the public . Claybrook said the victims still plan their own news_conference in Washington on Monday . B.J. Kincade , who heads a victims ' recall group , characterized the settlement as a corporate payoff that &quot; amounts to nothing more_than a sentence of death &quot; to drivers of these trucks .
