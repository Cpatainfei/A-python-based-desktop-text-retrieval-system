   <HEADLINE> TIMES O.C. POLL ; PROP . 187 HAS EVEN BACKERS A BIT UNEASY ; ALTHOUGH IT STILL HAS SUBSTANTIAL APPROVAL , 62 % SAY THEY WOULD NOT TURN IN AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT -- WHICH INITIATIVE WOULD REQUIRE OF SOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deep within the epicenter of the Proposition 187 movement , there ' s shuddering among supporters who feel uneasy about the measure ' s ban on public education for illegal immigrant children . Orange County voters still favor the initiative by a solid 60 % to 33 % , but a majority said they would not alert authorities about illegal immigrant students , a Times Orange County Poll has found . Sixty-two percent of the voters said they would not turn_in an undocumented student -- something that would be required of education , health and law_enforcement officials under one of the measure ' s more controversial provisions . Such reservations may indicate soft support , according to Mark Baldassare , chairman of Urban and Regional Planning at the UCI School of Ecology , who conducted the poll . &quot; And as people learn more , they could become more uncomfortable , &quot; he said . Even so , illegal immigration remains a troubling issue for most voters in Orange County , the birthplace of the so-called &quot; Save Our State &quot; ballot initiative that would deny non-emergency health_care , education and social_services to undocumented immigrants . Fifty-eight percent said they considered illegal immigration a big problem in Orange County . And their choices in major state races tended to mirror their views on the topic . Republican Gov . Pete Wilson , who has been stumping for immigration reform with his television ads , has steadily amassed a huge lead over his challenger , Democrat Kathleen Brown , with the governor favored 62 % to 24 % . Wilson gained 10 points since the last Times Orange County Poll in May , shoring_up his base with overwhelming support from 83 % of Republicans . Those margins provide Wilson with a critical edge_in the fertile Republican territory of Orange County , which Republicans need for a statewide victory . Four years ago , Wilson won Orange County with 63 % of the vote , enabling him to narrowly defeat Dianne Feinstein in the governor ' s race . Also leading in Orange County is Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington , who recently declared his support for Proposition 187 . Huffington is ahead of Democratic Sen . Dianne Feinstein by 54 % to 30 % . But Huffington appears to be running in place , his level of support remaining unchanged since a similar poll done_in May . His present lead is not enough to guarantee a state victory since Republican candidates typically need a 2-to-1 lead in Orange County to offset voting in the Democratic strongholds of San Francisco and Los Angeles . Republican Dan Lungren commands such a lead in his race for attorney_general , with voters favoring him by 48 % to Democrat Tom Umberg ' s 22 % . Twenty-seven percent remain undecided . The telephone poll of 600 registered Orange County voters was conducted from Oct . 22 through last Tuesday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 % . Baldassare said the governor ' s Orange County lead is particularly important for Wilson because he needs those votes as the race tightens statewide . Equally significant , he said , is that Huffington has not been able to build_on his Orange County lead in the past six months . Wilson and Huffington are drawing voters who overwhelmingly approve of the immigration reform measure . Seventy-three percent of Wilson ' s supporters and 76 % of Huffington ' s backers intend to vote for Proposition 187 . However , these voters do not expect the initiative to solve the thorny problem of illegal immigration : Just 20 % think the measure will make a big difference . Supporter David Buening , 38 , of Cypress fully expects the measure to be tossed_out by the courts . And yet he still plans to vote for it . &quot; It ' s just to send a message , &quot; he said . &quot; It will be ruled unconstitutional . But that ' s probably one of the reasons why I ' m going_to vote for it . I don ' t necessarily agree with it all_the way . . . . While I agree with the fact of denying public_services to illegal immigrants , I would let them at least get inoculations against tuberculosis. &quot; Within Buening ' s own household , the Proposition 187 debate rages between him and his wife , a German immigrant who is vehemently opposed . Buening also has some doubts about_turning in an undocumented immigrant to authorities . &quot; I don ' t know now , &quot; he said . &quot; I guess I probably would although I don ' t know any illegal aliens myself. &quot; In Rancho Santa Margarita , the same fierce debate is taking_place between Mary Lou Rodriguez and some of her relatives who support Proposition 187 . Rodriguez , 41 , a U.S. citizen and native of Mexico , will vote against the measure because she fears it threatens her privacy and constitutional rights . &quot; I still feel this is a legal way to discriminate , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want to subject my daughter to being questioned for documents . I personally don ' t want to be questioned and sometimes I think it will get_to this fine point . Why should everyone be policed by some_other individual ? that ' s a police state. &quot; Typically , the voters ' opinions are much more volatile in an initiative campaign . Voters make_up their minds fairly late and if they are confused or undecided they ' re more likely to vote no , according to David B . Magleby , a Brigham Young University political_scientist who has extensively researched the initiative process . &quot; To date in the campaign , the issue was defined as a way to send a message about illegal immigration -- it costs too_much . Now the opponents have found ways to raise doubts about Orwellian life , &quot; Magleby said . The vague concerns of supporters provide an opportunity for the opposition , he said . How the Poll Was Conducted The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates . The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted October 22-25 on weekday nights and weekend days . A computer-generated random_sample of telephone_numbers was used . Once a household was reached , we asked to speak with a registered voter . The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 4 % at the 95 % confidence level . That means it is 95 % certain the results are within 4 percentage_points of what they would be if every registered voter in Orange County were interviewed . For subgroups , such_as likely voters , the margin of error would be larger ( plus or minus 5 % ) . Proposition 187 , Wilson Winning Although an six in 10 county voters support Proposition 187 , the same number say they would not report it if they knew of an illegal immigrant child attending a local school . Support for the proposition follows political views , with liberals most in opposition . Proposition 187 would make illegal immigrants ineligible for public social_services , public health_care services ( unless an emergency under federal law ) , and attendance atpublic schools , and require state and local agencies to report suspected illegalimmigrants .

Huffington has not increased his share of the vote but has apparently persuaded some to abandon their earlier support for Feinstein . Incumbent Attorney_General Dan Lungren holds a 2-1 edge over Democratic challenger Tom Umberg with one voter in four still undecided .
