   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA HASN ' T BEEN ' LOST ' . . . YET ; U.S. POLICY : INSTEAD OF OVERREACTING TO THE ZHIRINOVSKY THREAT , STEP BACK AND CRAFT A LONG-TERM PEACE STRATEGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Russians have a proverb : A muzhik ( peasant ) doesn ' t make the sign_of_the_cross until he hears the thunder . The same holds true for the American political Establishment : It crosses itself only after the thunder has struck -- when the lightning has already done its damage . Look_at all_of the so-called Great Debates on foreign_policy : As a rule , they are conducted in past terms : Who lost Eastern Europe ( the Yalta betrayal ) ? Who lost China ? Cuba ? And so on . Now we can smell in the air a new &quot; who lost &quot; debate , this time about Russia . And the role of thunder is being played by victorious ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . Everybody curses him , all_right . But at_the_same_time , there is a strong feeling that if Zhirinovsky didn ' t already exist , he ' d have to be invented because everybody benefits from him , even if they won ' t acknowledge it . Boris Yeltsin uses the Zhirinovsky bugaboo to extract political and economic concessions from the West , and from the United States in particular . The Eastern European_countries have converted the fascist buffoon into a Trojan_horse they hope to ride into NATO . In short , everybody is happy with Zhirinovsky ' s picturesque existence , including the movers and shakers of American foreign_policy ( Strobe Talbott ' s elevation to the No . 2 position at the State_Department is the latest example of this phenomenon ) . But let ' s stop playing with Zhirinovsky ' s persona for a moment and remember that the future of mankind is at stake . History is not dead yet , and there are mind-boggling questions before us : Must the United States ease pressure on Yeltsin to reform Russia ' s economy as fast as possible ? Must the United States put more emphasis on &quot; therapy &quot; and less on &quot; shock &quot; ? Will de-emphasizing rapid economic change in favor of maintaining living standards save Russia from fascism and communism ? Is the notorious &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; just a euphemism for a new Munich , this time sacrificing the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe on the shaky altar of the old-fashioned Great Power condominium ? Will the NATO membership of some Eastern European_countries and some former Soviet republics strengthen or weaken democracy ? And where does that leave the states not blessed with a NATO invitation ? If we don ' t have the right answers_for them , and at the right time , these thunderous questions can ignite lightning answers without giving us even time to cross our bleeding hearts . We are asking Hamlet ' s questions . And what does President Clinton say ? &quot; We ' re going to work hard to try to make everybody feel good about this approach &quot; ( Partnership for Peace ) . But trying to make everybody feel good is just courting disaster . Politics is not lovemaking . Unfortunately . I certainly don ' t feel good . In fact , I feel afraid -- afraid because I already smell the very seductive aroma of appeasement in the air . Time is very precious and is running_out . History , which is very much alive , gives us one more chance to have a productive great debate . I suggest as a venue the House Foreign Affairs Committee , so ably and wisely chaired by Rep . Lee Hamilton . I suggest that he invite the widest possible spectrum of political_scientists and economists , from the scholars who , like Francis Fukuyama , proclaim the end of history and promise us the Golden Age , to those who , like me , fear a new Stone_Age . To make these hearings as representative as possible , I suggest the participation of four waves of the best minds : first , American scholars , then Russian emigre scholars , then Russian scholars , and , finally , scholars from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics . Peace is too precious a commodity to leave it solely to diplomats and politicians . We scholars are maybe more irresponsible than diplomats , but , on the other hand , we are more independent and our ambitions are_better suited for productive brainstorming . Maybe we don ' t know how to cook , but we sure know how to stir . The fateful decisions that affect the future of our civilization cannot depend_on such trivial circumstance as who is President Yeltsin ' s tennis partner or President Clinton ' s former college roommate .</TEXT>
