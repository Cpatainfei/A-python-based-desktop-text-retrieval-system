   <TEXT> American forces have been_on duty in South_Korea for more_than 40 years , standing_guard over an armistice agreement that never evolved into a permanent peace_treaty . With tensions rising over North_Korea ' s nuclear intensions , more U.S. troops and equipment are_on the way . U.S. military commanders say the move is larely for logistical reasons , allowing easy movement of U.S. equipment on a non-emergency basis .

MILITARY STRENGTH 03 # 28 , 21 # 22 North_Korea South_Korea Total active armed forces : 1.2 million 650 # 000 Defense spending : $ 5.5 billion ( 1992 ) $ 11.1 billion ( 1992 ) Active infantry divisions : 30 21 Tanks : 3 # 500 1 # 800 Field_artillery : 8 # 400 4 # 500 Surface-to-air_missiles : 54 24 Multiple rocket_launchers : 2 # 400 114 CURRENT U.S. COMMITMENT Army troops : 26 # 000 Air_force : 9 # 500 Combat aircraft : 84 U.S. missiles on the way The United States is sending Patriot missiles , which became familiar to the public during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War when they were used to defend Israel and Saudi_Arabia against Iraqi Scud missiles . They could be used to defend U.S. and South_Korean military_installations from North_Korean missiles . The Patriot force includes : * 1 Patriot missile battalion ( includes 24 to 48 launchers ) * 850 soldiers from Ft . Bliss , Tex. , to operate the batteries Major U.S. Bases Army Yongsan Garrison Tongduchon Camp Red Cloud Camp Humphreys Camp Henry * Air_Force Sokcho Osan Air_Base Kunsan Air_Base Pusan Air_Base BACKGROUND ON THE CURRENT CONFLICT North_Korea , a hard-line Marxist state , insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes . But its rejection of full inspections has heightened suspicions that it is developing a nuclear arsenal . South_Korean President Kim Young Sam said deployment of the Patriot missiles plus resumption of military exercises with the United States were in_order because the Communist north has failed to allow full nuclear inspections and swap envoys with the south . Since 1953 , an uneasy peace One of the bloodiest wars in history began on June 25 , 1950 when Communist North_Korea invaded South_Korea . By September , North_Korean troops had pushed to the Pusan Perimter . In a surprise move , U.N. forces landed at Inchon . The U.N. force -- 90 % American -- pushed as far north as the Yalu_River by October . China entered the war that same month , pushing U.N. forces_back below the 38th Parallel . North and South_Korea signed an armistice in July , 1953 . The toll : 580 # 000 U.N. troops and 1.6 million Communist troops killed or wounded .
