   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : FEES FOR SERVICES TO BE CONSIDERED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County could soon begin charging fees to monitor rent in mobile_home parks , answer questions from the public over the telephone and research queries about illegal land divisions . Those fee proposals are among several being considered to replace subsidies and reduce the county Resource Management Agency ' s budget by $ 517 # 000.The Ventura County Board of Supervisors is expected to vote on the measures today . To make_up for the $ 50 # 000 cost of administering the mobile_home rent review program , Thomas Berg , director of the Resource Management Agency , has proposed charging park owners $ 3 per space per month . Berg ' s other proposals include billing two water districts $ 18 # 000 for a public education program teaching conservation and increasing the cost of permits issued to companies that film movies in Ventura County . In addition to proposing eight immediate changes , Berg also gave the supervisors a long-term list of ideas for saving money . Among the suggestions was setting specific fines for violating building_code regulations and instituting a 900 phone_number that would charge residents who call the agency seeking information . If the cuts are not made , 12 positions will be eliminated from the Resource Management Agency , which includes planning , environmental health and the Air_Pollution Control District . With the implementation of fees , three positions would be cut . Supervisor Maggie Kildee said the county must charge the fees or eliminate the services . &quot; There simply isn ' t enough money to keep_on doing the things we ' ve traditionally done , &quot; she said . &quot; When you cut services , you cut good things. &quot; JULIE FIELDS</TEXT>
