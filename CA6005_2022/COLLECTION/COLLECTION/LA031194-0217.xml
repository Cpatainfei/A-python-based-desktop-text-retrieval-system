   <HEADLINE> SOCCER TOUR GETS STARTED AMID UNFULFILLED PROMISES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> World Cup officials on Thursday launched the much-publicized Legacy Tour ' 94 in ceremonies held next to a pockmarked and muddy field at the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Watts . World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg presided over the unveiling of a small &quot; Skills Court &quot; -- a fenced-in area covered with artificial turf topped with sand.The unkempt field adjacent to the festivities was supposed to have been the site of the World Cup ' s first Inner-City Soccer Program . That field was the scene of another World Cup press_conference , held_on Nov . 24 , 1992 . At that time Rothenberg announced , along with officials of Rebuild LA , that the field would be reseeded and refurbished and provided with lights . Officials said the work was scheduled to begin immediately . Fifteen months later , the field remains unimproved . Rothenberg said Thursday that it would be upgraded , some time after April 22 , when the Legacy Tour officially begins . &quot; It ' s coming , &quot; Rothenberg said of the work . &quot; The field is played_on so_much , it ' s tough to get started. &quot; The ambitious Inner-City Soccer Program had promised to improve soccer facilities , supply tickets to national-team games and first-round World Cup matches , conduct clinics with national team players in &quot; neglected areas of Los Angeles , &quot; and conduct training sessions at the U.S. soccer training facility at Mission Viejo . How many of these goals have been reached is unclear . World Cup officials have made much of their effort to get urban children interested in soccer , a sport with few roots in the black community . The Legacy Tour is a national program designed to leave a &quot; legacy &quot; of soccer around the country . Some cities will receive the small courts and others will have existing soccer fields upgraded .</TEXT>
