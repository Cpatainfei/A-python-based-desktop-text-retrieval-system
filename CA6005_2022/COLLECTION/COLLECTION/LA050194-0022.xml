   <HEADLINE> FOCUS ; WITH SWEEPS , YOU GET STARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s May sweeps , when the networks will roll_out the big guns : the Menendezes , Miss Universe and a Stephen King miniseries . And on regular shows , it means the special guest star . If Urkel needs an aunt on &quot; Family Matters , &quot; have it be Donna Summer . The &quot; Fresh Prince ' s &quot; home is for_sale , have the buyer be Donald Trump and Marla Maples-Trump . &quot; seaQuest DSV &quot; needs a breath of fresh air , so have someone who ' s parted the Red_Sea : Charlton Heston ( Sunday ) . This is &quot; stunt casting , &quot; where big names who normally don ' t pop_up on TV -- and some who never even act -- show_up on series . Guest-celebrity casting goes_on all season , but even more so during a sweeps month , when ad rates are set for local stations . And this month the networks want to make_sure that their regular shows go_out with a bang before summer reruns . &quot; Stunt casting tells the viewer that , ' Hey , the lights are_on here , ' &quot; says Preston Beckman , NBC senior_vice_president of program planning and scheduling . For faltering shows , guest stars can be a godsend . Witness &quot; Homicide , &quot; the critically acclaimed drama series that NBC brought_back from hiatus last January . For its return episode , the guest was Robin Williams , just as his movie &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; was drawing huge audiences in theaters . &quot; That episode was clearly written with him in mind , &quot; Beckman says . &quot; It was the ultimate stunt casting. &quot; Top shows have proved quite adept at knowing how to use guest stars . &quot; Murphy Brown &quot; will feature movie director Louis Malle , Candice Bergen ' s real-life husband , playing himself . The season ' s No . 1 show , &quot; Home Improvement &quot; will feature separate episodes with Victoria Principal , real-life improvement expert Bob Vila and the astronauts who repaired the Hubble Space telescope . New viewers may tune_in to both shows , but more_than likely , the guest stars will be a wake-up call to get regular audiences to tune_in . On one of the back-to-back episodes of &quot; The Mommies &quot; this week , &quot; Lassie &quot; and &quot; Lost in Space &quot; mother June Lockhart plays the divorced mother of Barb ( Julia Duffy ) . Also in the same episode will be other TV moms of yesteryear : Barbara Billingsley ( &quot; Leave It to Beaver &quot; ) and Florence Henderson ( &quot; The Brady Bunch &quot; ) and Audra Lindley ( &quot; Bridget Loves Bernie &quot; and &quot; Three ' s Company &quot; ) . An episode filled with today ' s supermodels preceeds it . &quot; The average viewer watches two out of every four episodes of the top-rated shows , &quot; says David Poltrack , CBS executive_vice_president of research and planning . &quot; So ( with celebrity casting ) you may get a higher proportion of the core audience . You get them to say , ' There ' s something special about this episode . I better watch it. ' &quot; On &quot; Evening Shade , &quot; singer Tony Bennett , suddenly hotter than ever , plays against type this month : He acts . &quot; I ' m not shooting_for ( acting roles ) , but if I get a magnificent script , I ' m not going_to knock it , &quot; says Bennett , who plays a nightclub singer-turned-salesman . &quot; I went_to work , and I loved it. &quot; For the cast of &quot; The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. , &quot; guest stars meant a chance to toss a football around with National Football_League stars and game announcer Terry Bradshaw , who plays a &quot; Robert Duvall-esque colonel , &quot; according to executive producer Carlton Cuse . &quot; A lot of the NFL audience will like Brisco , &quot; Cuse says . &quot; It ' s synergy. &quot; You ' ll find lots of football_players on Fox series this month . It may be the month ' s ultimate stunt : Fox starts NFL broadcasts in late summer .
