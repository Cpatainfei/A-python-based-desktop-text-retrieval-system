   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / RICHARD O ' REILLY : SWEET PRAISE FOR ' SUITE ' SOFTWARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Integrated software , which combines several functions such_as word_processing , spreadsheet and database , has never caught_on with consumers the way stand-alone programs have . Yet now that Windows has taken_over most of our PCs , the hottest software_packages these days are the competing &quot; office &quot; and &quot; suite &quot; bundles that integrate groups of stand-alone programs . that ' s some irony , since the advantage of Windows is supposed to be that Windows programs from various manufacturers can coexist and even integrate with each other merely by virtue of being Windows programs . But in fact , Microsoft Office 4.2 , Lotus SmartSuite 2.1 and Borland Office 2.0 do have added integration compared to the stand-alone versions of their components . More important , however , they provide bargain prices to those who really can use most of the programs they contain . For large companies , particularly , they make_it easier to assure that everyone has the same version of a program . For single users , however , especially those who actually will only use one or two of the programs such_as word_processing and spreadsheet , it still may be cheaper to buy stand-alone versions of those programs and it may well be cheaper in the future to buy upgrades for an individual program or two rather than for an entire office package . If you are a potential office software buyer , there are many factors , often conflicting , to consider in making a choice . But the good news is that you can ' t really make a mistake . All three contain top-notch programs that have far more functionality than any one person is likely ever to use . * Of course if you already use one or more of the products , the choice is pretty easy -- unless you happen to use the word_processor found in one bundle , the spreadsheet in another and the database in a third . In that case , remember that database applications with custom forms and reports are the most difficult to convert to another program , followed by spreadsheets with fancy macros automating them . Word_processing files are the easiest to convert . If you ' re just getting started , I think Lotus SmartSuite is the best value because it contains the broadest range of programs that are needed to run a small business or home_office . Just about anyone qualifies for the liberal $ 299 &quot; upgrade &quot; price for SmartSuite , which includes AmiPro 3.1 word_processing , Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows release 4 spreadsheet , Approach 2.1 database , Freelance Graphics 2.01 for presentation graphics and the Lotus Organizer personal information manager . Microsoft Office 4.2 has the distinction of bundling the most state-of-the art software , including Word for Windows 6.0 , the Excel 5.0 spreadsheet , PowerPoint 4.0 presentations graphics and Microsoft Mail for $ 299 in a liberally applied upgrade policy . For an extra $ 99 , you can add Access 2.0 , the just-about-to-ship version of Microsoft ' s in-house designed database . Unfortunately the more powerful Microsoft Foxpro for Windows database , which grew out of a Microsoft acquisition , is not offered as part of the package . The new Microsoft Office packages that actually contain all_the software should be hitting dealers ' shelves about now . Until now you got disks and manuals for Word for Windows and Mail and an 800 number to call to get_on the waiting list for the new versions of Excel and PowerPoint . I got my Excel package about six weeks ago and PowerPoint arrived two weeks ago . * Accompanying the programs bundled in Borland Office is something of an identify crisis . The program bundles WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows from WordPerfect Corp. , along with Borland ' s easy to navigate QuattroPro 5.0 for Windows spreadsheet and Paradox for Windows 4.5 database software . But Borland is a shrinking company and WordPerfect , the king of DOS word_processing , has been seriously outsold in the Windows word processing marketplace by Microsoft . Now WordPerfect Corp . is being bought by networking giant Novell Inc. However , Borland Office 2.0 , also priced at $ 299 as an upgrade from virtually any single competing program , will continue to be sold . There is sure to be a next version , although with a different name , and it is sure to offer strong integration with Novell network systems . Whatever its future name , it still will contain both Quattro Pro and Paradox . Novell is buying Quattro Pro from Borland in conjunction with the WordPerfect deal and it also has a deal to bundle Paradox into a_million sets of the next version of the Office package . To get the most out of the integration offered by any of these packages , you need a fast 486-equipped computer with at least 8 megabytes of random_access_memory and hard_disk storage of at least 200 megabytes . Figure on 50 to 60 megabytes of disk_space just to install any of these three products . That doesn ' t count DOS and Windows , the extra fonts you ' ll undoubtedly acquire , and fancy screen_savers and other special purpose software such_as telecommunications and fax , which isn ' t included in any of these three bundles .</TEXT>
