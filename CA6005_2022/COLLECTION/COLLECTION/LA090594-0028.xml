   <HEADLINE> MINOR PARTIES CAN HAVE MAJOR CLOUT ; ELECTION : EXIT POLLS IN THE JUNE PARTY PRIMARIES SHOW A POSSIBLE 20 % DEFECTION FROM BROWN , WILSON IN NOVEMBER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Howard Stern isn ' t running_for governor of New York after all . The shock jock ' s withdrawal as the Libertarian Party nominee puts an end to news coverage of minor party candidates for the 1994 election season . that ' s too_bad , because minor parties could determine one of the biggest elections of the year , the high-stakes California governor ' s race . If June primary exit polls are to be believed , alternative parties could take as much as 20 % of the vote from Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson . In a Times ' exit poll of Democratic primary voters , more_than 10 % -- 25 % of John Garamendi supporters and 18 % of Tom Hayden supporters -- said they would vote for &quot; someone else &quot; in a Brown-Wilson race . Among Republicans , 28 % of Ron Unz supporters , slightly less than 10 % of the voters in that primary , said they ' d vote for &quot; someone else. &quot; Those opinions could change by November , of course , but primary voters are among the most committed party loyalists , especially given June ' s record low turnout , and presumably the least likely to abandon their party ' s standard bearer . A 20 % tally for minor parties may be unlikely , but a substantial protest vote seems almost inevitable . Wilson , in particular , could be in_trouble . Unz ' s non-endorsement -- he urged supporters to vote for candidates who shared their &quot; principles of lower taxes and less government &quot; -- sounded like a plug for the Libertarians . And Libertarian candidate Richard Rider is now campaigning for Unz voters , focusing_on Wilson ' s record on taxes . Meanwhile , the state ' s largest minor party , the all-but-invisible American Independent Party , is growing rapidly . Since 1992 , it has picked_up more_than 54 # 000 registered members -- 9 % of total growth in voter registration and about three times the increase in Republicans . The party can capture Perotistas with its name alone , and for anti-Wilson conservatives , its George Wallace roots promise a platform that out-toughs the governor on immigration and crime . Brown can ' t count_on minor parties to beat Wilson for her , however . Her exit poll losses were even higher than his , and both the Greens and the Peace and Freedom Party offer alternatives to her on the left . Since many protest votes are decided at the last minute , an attractive ballot label can be enough to woo the disaffected . Reporters , then , shouldn ' t let their two-party habits blind them . Minor party votes have risen sharply in the last few years . Among congressional races with an alternative-party option , the minor party vote has gone from less than 1 % in 1986 to 6.5 % in 1990 to 9.4 % in 1992 , according to data collected by Ryan Iwasaka for a Claremont McKenna College thesis . In California , minor party or independent candidates took more_than the spread between the Democrat and the Republican in nine 1992 House races , two state Senate_races and four Assembly races . For the U.S. Senate seat won by Democrat Barbara Boxer , candidates from the American Independent , Peace and Freedom and Libertarian parties got almost 10 % of the vote . Boxer beat Republican Bruce Herschensohn by five points . That same year , Georgia Republican Paul Coverdell won election to the U.S. Senate only after a 3 % showing by Libertarian Jim Hudson threw the race into a runoff . Coverdell courted Libertarian voters and beat Democratic incumbent Wyche Fowler by 15 # 000 votes . In Democratic Hawaii , the Green Party ' s Linda Martin won 14 % of the vote against incumbent Sen . Daniel Inouye , who was tarred by sexual-harassment charges . And in Ohio , similarly scandal-tarnished Democrat John_Glenn , one of the &quot; Keating Five , &quot; won reelection to the Senate with barely 51 % of the vote ; news_reports neglected to mention that 7 % went_to Martha Grevatt , an independent . Minor parties provide two kinds of protest votes : anti-scandal , as in Ohio and Hawaii , and ideological , as in Georgia . In either case , alternative parties let voters express their dissatisfaction with government as usual . Though neither Pete Wilson nor Kathleen Brown is tarred by scandal , both definitely represent the political Establishment . And both are running name-calling centrist campaigns with positions based more on polls than on principles . November ' s , then , could prove the biggest election yet for minor parties in California , a state whose culture encourages diversity and self-expression . The ballot will have at least four alternative candidates for governor . And though none will be a famous shock jock , how they do is a story worth following .</TEXT>
