   <TEXT> Your editorials on foreign_policy and the U.N. ( Nov . 20 , 27 , Dec . 4 , 11 ) are indeed erudite , comprehensive and coherent , with extensive quotation from foreign affairs experts . Your support for a rapid deployment force and its functional operation reflects a continuation of a Cold_War and colonial policy of solving conflicts by military intervention.There is ample evidence of the failures of these missions . Ethnic , religious and class conflicts have been pandered to , regional harmony and stability shattered , democracies crushed , repressive regimes endured and alliances formed in the wake of the Cold_War , as a part of global strategy . The present constitution of the Security_Council is undemocratic and unrepresentative ; it must include more countries from Asia , South_America and Africa like Japan , India , Brazil and Nigeria . The role of the U.N. should be confined to the areas of health , culture , art , economics , trade , education , food and terrorism . Your suggestion of U.S. military intervention in combatting regional conflict or violation of human_rights is also not sound unless the security and vital interests of the U.S. are threatened . The economy and high standards of ethics should be the future direction in the post-Cold War era . NIRODE C . MOHANTY Huntington Beach</TEXT>
