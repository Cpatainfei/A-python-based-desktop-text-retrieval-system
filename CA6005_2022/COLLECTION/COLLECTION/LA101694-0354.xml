   <TEXT> Moving toward a showdown , thousands of Islamic militants rallied against PLO chief Yasser Arafat on Saturday , and gunmen threatened to &quot; make Gaza burn &quot; if the arrests of fundamentalists continue . The Palestinian self-rule government led by Arafat urged Israel to resume talks on expanding autonomy and to reopen Israel to Gaza workers . It said the sanctions imposed after the kidnaping of an Israeli soldier played into the hands of extremists . The hostage , Cpl . Nachshon Waxman , 19 , was shot to death Friday during an army raid on the kidnapers ' West_Bank hide-out . Waxman ' s three captors and an Israeli commando were also killed . In Jerusalem , 15 # 000 Israelis attended Waxman ' s midnight funeral . In his eulogy , army Gen . Yitzhak Mordechai said commandos &quot; were seconds late &quot; in saving Waxman : &quot; The scoundrels ( the captors ) shot you while you were tied and could not fight back. &quot; Near the grave site , dozens of soldiers held each other and wept . Hundreds of police were deployed at the funeral to prevent anti-Arab riots . Hamas , the Muslim fundamentalist group that held Waxman , warned Saturday that it will kidnap more Israelis unless Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin agrees to free 200 Palestinian prisoners . A strike called by Hamas to mourn the dead kidnapers shut_down most of the West_Bank on Saturday . The Izzidin al-Qassam , Hamas ' underground military wing , threatened to unleash a civil_war if Palestinian police continued to arrest Hamas activists . Under pressure from Israel and the United States , Arafat ordered more_than 160 rounded_up last week as part of the effort to find the kidnapers . &quot; Izzidin al-Qassam ' s answer will be to make Gaza burn , &quot; said a Hamas leaflet distributed Saturday . &quot; Hamas doesn ' t allow any faction to lay a finger on its followers. &quot; Waxman ' s abduction forced Arafat into an unwanted showdown with Hamas , his strongest political rival . In the past , Arafat was reluctant to crack_down , fearing his fragile government might not survive a confrontation in the streets . But after the kidnaping , Rabin turned_up the pressure , insisting that the hostage was held_in Gaza and that Arafat was solely responsible_for the soldier ' s fate . Palestinians have self-rule in all_of Gaza but only a portion of the West_Bank . In response , Arafat ordered the arrest sweeps . Ahmed Bahar , a Hamas leader , accused Arafat of surrendering to the Israelis . &quot; The Palestinian Authority knelt before Rabin and arrested our fighters to appease the Israelis , &quot; he said as he paid his condolences to the family of slain kidnaper Salah Jadalla , 22 , in a Gaza City slum . Yasser Abed-Rabbo , information minister in the self-rule government , suggested Saturday that the crackdown against Hamas will continue . &quot; We will not permit anything to harm the national security , &quot; he told reporters after the weekly Cabinet meeting . &quot; The Palestinian Authority . . . will continue taking measures to ensure national security. &quot; In a first_step , the Cabinet decided to ban the use of mosque loudspeakers for political propaganda . The PLO also criticized Israel ' s actions , saying the sanctions imposed after the kidnaping violated the peace agreement signed_in September , 1993 . &quot; The negotiations should not be used as a weapon whenever an incident occurs . . . . It will jeopardize the relations between both sides , &quot; Abed-Rabbo said . Palestinian sources said Rabin called Arafat late Friday and promised to reopen the Gaza Strip &quot; very soon. &quot; Rabin told reporters that he would contact the PLO soon about restarting negotiations on expanding autonomy in the West_Bank . Across town , about 5 # 000 Hamas supporters marched to the central jail Saturday to press for the release of the detainees . &quot; Arafat , Arafat , hear the news , the soldiers of Qassam are waiting for you , &quot; chanted the marchers , some raising the Koran , the Muslim holy book . Scores of armed police formed a chain to block the prison gate , and snipers looked down from surrounding rooftops . However , march organizers kept the crowd at_bay , and the protest broke_up after several hours without violence . The mood was defiant and angry at a wake for the dead kidnapers that drew thousands who gathered under a large canopy in a sandy lot . Two masked men fired shots in the air from the rooftop of an adjacent kindergarten , and from loudspeakers blared a Hamas fighting song , &quot; Load your guns , oh Izzidin. &quot; In a speech to the mourners , Ahmed Turk , student council president at Gaza City ' s Islamic University , accused Arafat of collaborating with the Israelis . &quot; The ( Israeli ) occupation authorities have located the hide-out of the kidnapers based on information they received from the Palestinian Authority , &quot; Turk claimed . Abed-Rabbo denied the charges , but the accusation could erode public support for Arafat ' s government . Even Palestinians who support reconciliation with Israel reject the idea of collaborating with the former occupying power against fellow Palestinians . Israel ' s army chief_of_staff , Lt . Gen . Ehud Barak , said Israeli and Palestinian security services shared information throughout the affair .</TEXT>
