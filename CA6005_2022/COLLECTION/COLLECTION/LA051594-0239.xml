   <HEADLINE> RIGHTS STILL AT RISK FOR GUATEMALANS ; CENTRAL_AMERICA : NATION HAS WORST RECORD IN HEMISPHERE , ACTIVISTS SAY . A U.N. TEAM EXPECTS TO MEET OFFICIAL RESISTANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carlos Catalan ' s run-in with the Guatemalan army began as a traffic altercation . Driving his bus along a steep road 40 miles outside this capital , he encountered a Nissan utility vehicle , but neither motorist would let the other pass . It was the kind of traffic macho that is common on Central_American streets . But when the driver of the Nissan lowered a tinted window and began shooting at the bus , Catalan ' s nightmare began . Fearing for the safety of his 60 passengers , Catalan sped away until he reached a police post , where he expected to report the incident . But the other driver turned_out to be an army intelligence_officer . Over the days that followed , Catalan said , he was beaten , followed , snatched from a hospital at gunpoint and threatened with death if he tried to file charges or speak publicly about what happened . The beating and kicking that Catalan says he received from the well-placed army colonel caused him to lose a testicle , and his family has fled the country . Catalan now lives a frightened life , taking refuge at a Roman_Catholic_church while his case goes_through the courts . &quot; They destroyed my life in a way you cannot imagine , &quot; he said . Catalan ' s story is one of dozens of cases that human_rights activists are pressing in an effort to challenge what they describe as the continued power and impunity of the Guatemalan military . Despite changes in the command of a notoriously brutal army , and an end to the kinds of army-directed massacres that decimated Mayan communities in the 1980s , murder , torture and disappearances by government_security forces continue , human_rights and church officials say . With one of the most abysmal human_rights records in the Western_Hemisphere , Guatemala has finally agreed to allow the permanent presence of an international monitoring team from the United Nations . The decision was hailed as a major breakthrough in Guatemala ' s efforts to end a 33-year civil_war that has claimed about 100 # 000 lives . Human_rights verification had been a key stumbling_block in reaching a peace accord . But even before the mission begins , there are signs its mandate will be limited by unrest and government resistance . A recent wave of anti-foreigner violence , in which North_Americans were accused of stealing Guatemalan children and two U.S. citizens were beaten by enraged crowds , is being seen in some circles as a warning to the U.N. mission , which is scheduled to arrive this month . U.N. officials say privately that they are worried . And government and army officials seem determined to restrict the work of the U.N. monitors by requiring them to turn_over any investigation to existing Guatemalan institutions , such_as the police . Some of these institutions are already discredited because of their routine failure to solve cases or prosecute abusers who are members of security_forces . The U.N. human_rights mission was authorized in a landmark agreement signed March 29 in Mexico_City by the government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and guerrillas of the leftist Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union . With this new push to end the war , the two sides also agreed to discuss the formation of a crucial but controversial commission to examine the past massacres and atrocities of the war . Guerrilla spokesmen said they are confident the commission will be established in the next round of peace talks in Norway later this month . But the army hates the idea . Senior officers warn against a commission similar to the U.N.-sponsored &quot; Truth Commission &quot; that was formed as part of peace accords that ended neighboring El_Salvador ' s 12-year civil_war . The Salvadoran panel named names and implicated government_security forces or their right-wing backers in most of the war ' s atrocities . Guatemalan church and human_rights groups argue that the commission is vital to building peace on a foundation of justice that clarifies who killed whom and what exactly happened to about 40 # 000 missing union , student and peasant leaders . The criminals , they argue , should be held accountable . Army_officers , accused of many of the crimes , do not agree , saying the past should be relegated to the past . And they contend that the guerrillas would be unfairly spared scrutiny . &quot; If it were up_to me , the commission would not exist , &quot; the defense minister , Gen . Mario Enriquez , told The Times . &quot; It will not reconcile . It will only polarize. &quot; Such resistance could doom the panel to failure . President De Leon , himself a former human_rights ombudsman , wants the commission to report on war_crimes without including the names of murderers and torturers , nor the institution to which they belonged . Hector Rosada , the government ' s representative to negotiations with the rebels and army , said that if the commission probes more deeply , if it follows the Salvadoran example , the entire peace process would be torpedoed . &quot; We don ' t want to provoke vengeance , &quot; he said in an interview in the presidential palace here . &quot; We want to put the emphasis on the victims , not on those who made them victims. &quot; Critics doubt that such a limited evaluation of war_crimes will satisfy victims ' families . &quot; If they do not name people , there will be resentment and anger , &quot; said Nineth Montenegro , a human_rights activist whose husband was among the tens of thousands of people who disappeared in the 1980s . &quot; We are not asking_for ( public ) trials , but there should be a moral judgment. &quot; The arrival of the U.N. monitors is especially welcomed by those who argue that Guatemala ' s human_rights situation has not improved under De Leon and may have actually deteriorated . De Leon ' s surprise election by the National Congress last June ended a dizzying series of coups and countercoups . His background as a human_rights prosecutor raised high hopes of sweeping reform , but many Guatemalans today say they are disappointed . He failed to disband army-backed Civilian Self-Defense Patrols , armed peasant vigilantes blamed for widespread abuses . Their elimination has been recommended by human_rights advocates the world over -- including De Leon himself before he was president . De Leon made progress early in his administration by starting to remove the military influence from the national police . But this year , civilians he had named to key posts were replaced by military hard-liners or extreme rightists . According to the Roman_Catholic archbishop ' s office on human_rights , the number of reported summary executions , disappearances and other violations grew at an &quot; alarming &quot; rate after De Leon took_office . Extrajudicial executions , for example , jumped from four in June to 27 in July and 50 in January , the church office said in a 468-page report . &quot; There have been many steps backward with_respect_to human_rights , &quot; said Fernando Lopez , legal director of the office . The reported violations come amid a wider escalation of violence in Guatemala . In addition to the attacks on foreigners , which prompted a U.S. State_Department warning against travel here , kidnapings , killings , unending public-service strikes , demonstrations and sit-ins -- plus renewed rumors of a military takeover -- have contributed to a climate of tension and instability . Perhaps the single most shocking incident was the April 1 slaying of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon , president of Guatemala ' s Constitutional Court , the highest_court in the land and possibly the country ' s last public institution with credibility . Several days later , Obdulio Chinchilla Vega , the most powerful and reputedly most corrupt member of the Guatemala ' s unicameral National Congress , was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt -- the second in 11 months . The guerrillas , whose war against the Guatemalan army has dropped_off considerably in recent years , have also been accused of human_rights violations , such_as forced recruitment of child soldiers and the use of peasant villagers as shields in the remote Peten and Quiche regions .</TEXT>
