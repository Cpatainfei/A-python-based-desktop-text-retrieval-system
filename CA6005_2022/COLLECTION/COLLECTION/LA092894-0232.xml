   <HEADLINE> BID TO FREEZE ASSETS OF AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN IS REJECTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal judge Tuesday declined to freeze the assets of U.S. Ambassador to France Pamela Harriman , ruling that there is little risk of her hiding funds or fleeing from a complicated legal fight with other heirs of the estate left by her late husband , financier and former New York Gov . W . Averell Harriman . In a case that offers a window on the monetary affairs of the wealthy , three generations of Harriman ' s heirs contend that Mrs . Harriman and prominent Washington lawyers Clark M . Clifford and Paul C . Warnke were &quot; grossly negligent &quot; and committed &quot; professional malpractice &quot; in violating the terms of limited partnership agreements and trusts . Harriman ' s daughters , grandchildren and great-grandchildren claim that nine trusts going_back to 1935 were squandered by the defendants on ill-conceived investments -- mainly a troubled 560-room New Jersey resort and conference_center . The former governor and veteran diplomat died on July 26 , 1986 , leaving an estate valued at about $ 65 million . The heirs charge that trust_funds once worth about $ 25 million have dwindled to $ 3 million . But U.S. District Judge John S . Martin Jr . ruled that Mrs . Harriman , a prominent Democratic_Party fund-raiser who helped President Clinton ' s election campaign , still has assets of more_than $ 30 million -- more_than enough to satisfy any eventual judgment in the case . &quot; Plaintiffs have not sufficiently established that there exists a real threat to their ability to enforce a judgment against Harriman and Clifford and that drastic action is required , &quot; Martin said in his written opinion . Veteran trust and estate lawyers said that unless a settlement is reached , the case could go_on for years , with issues to be litigated including whether Harriman ' s widow was a figurehead and decisions were made by others , whether investments were reasonable and what knowledge advisers had when they decided to allocate money . Pamela Harriman , who once was wed to Winston Churchill ' s son , Randolph , married Averell Harriman in 1971 when he was 79 and she was 51 . She quickly became one of Washington ' s premier hostesses and Democratic Party fund-raisers . When Harriman , who served as ambassador to the Soviet_Union and Great Britain , died in 1986 , he left her $ 33 million of his $ 65-million estate , according to court papers . The will also named her executor of his estate , with some responsibility for administering trusts Harriman set_up in 1935 for his daughters and their children . The will left only $ 4 # 000 in cash to each of his two daughters , &quot; not for any lack of love and affection for them but because I know them to be otherwise well provided for. &quot; Two years before he died , he asked Clifford , who was secretary_of_defense under President Lyndon B . Johnson , and Warnke , who served as President Jimmy_Carter ' s chief arms negotiator , to serve as unpaid trustees of the trusts . After his death , the trusts were consolidated in an investment pool , administered by a New York lawyer , William Rich III , who is also a defendant in the suit . At first the trusts did_well , growing to about $ 25 million . But when investments turned from the stock_market to real_estate , the results were hardly stellar . According to court papers , there was little diversification of assets . The Seasons Resort and Conference_Center in Vernon Valley , N.J. , where the trusts were heavily allocated , proved to be a financial sinkhole . According to the lawsuit , by 1993 the resort had gobbled_up $ 21 million of the trusts ' funds . Harriman ' s heirs charge -- and the defendants deny -- that the extent of the investment in the resort and other troubled ventures was concealed . Lawyers for the heirs had argued before Judge Martin that Harriman ' s widow was liquidating real_estate in Washington and Barbados and was giving other assets away or transferring them overseas . But the judge ruled &quot; none of the purported transfers of assets plaintiffs have highlighted raise any inference of an attempt to evade potential judgments , and Harriman has provided reasonable explanations for all_of them. &quot;</TEXT>
