   <HEADLINE> VISIONS OF A BILLION SALES DANCE IN THEIR HEADS ; TRADE : FOREIGN PRODUCTS ARE DOING_WELL IN CHINA . BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING_FORWARD TO MORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talk_of selling to China and that magic_number soon comes_up : 1 billion . Just imagine one sale for every man , woman and child in China , goes the foreign business person ' s perennial refrain . J . Michael Jardine of the Walt Disney Co . ( Hong Kong ) says it has already been done . Disney ' s Donald Bubble_Gum , made under license in China by a U.S.-Chinese joint_venture , sold more_than a_billion pieces last year , he said . &quot; I would hazard a guess that they are the first foreign-brand product to sell a_billion of anything in China , &quot; Jardine said . True , we ' re talking_about 1 1 / 4-inch pieces of bubble_gum priced at less than a penny apiece . But the achievement dramatizes how far foreign products have come_in China since the 1980s , when soft_drinks and cigarettes were virtually the only foreign-brand items in shops outside a_few major cities . Prospects of reaching at least the 300 million urban residents among China ' s 1.2 billion people are_better than ever . That explains why U.S. business people are nervously awaiting President Clinton ' s scheduled announcement in June on whether he ' ll renew China ' s low-tariff trade status of &quot; most favored nation &quot; for another year . He has threatened to cancel it if China fails to improve its human_rights record . Cancellation would close many business opportunities to Americans , although U.S. companies that already manufacture in China hope to be somewhat insulated from any tariff war . Foreign investment in China totaled $ 25.7 billion last year and could top that this year . Much of the investment is directed at making consumer goods for_sale inside China . Imports are also climbing , but high tariffs keep imported consumer items beyond the reach of most Chinese -- except when the goods are smuggled in , another growth area . It is now possible for a Chinese man or woman who has never gone abroad to start the day by shampooing with Head and Shoulders ; dress in an Anne Klein or Ermenegildo Zegna suit ; bicycle to work_on a Schwinn 12-speed ; sip instant Maxwell House coffee while working_at a Compaq computer ; lunch at Pizza Hut ; head for a health club and don Reebok exercise clothes ; then go_home to watch videos on a Toshiba television while snacking on M &amp; Ms or Planters Peanuts . There are even foreign stores that sell exclusively or predominantly foreign-brand products . Japan ' s Yaohan chain has a department_store in Beijing , and Seibu opened one last year in Shenzhen , adjoining Hong Kong . &quot; Chinese sports shoes don ' t look well , but the main thing is quality , &quot; said Han , a young_man in jeans and T-shirt who was buying Nike sports shoes at the Beijing Yaohan . The price was $ 60 , more_than most Chinese earn in a month , but Han said , &quot; I can wear these shoes three , four years. &quot; Disney has licensed more_than 60 children ' s boutiques in_stores around China , with clothing and toys featuring &quot; Mouse Mi &quot; -- Mickey_Mouse -- and &quot; Old Duck Tang &quot; -- Donald Duck . &quot; It will become the most important Asian market to us within 10 years , &quot; Jardine predicted . The factors behind the foreign invasion are many . Western and Japanese companies facing sluggish economies at_home are pushing harder at new markets and are applying lessons learned about China from less successful efforts in the 1980s . China has also let_down some barriers to foreign companies and products . Foreigners used to be barred from retailing ; now , joint-venture stores are allowed_in some cities . Turning Chinese renminbi into hard currency used to be impossible ; now it ' s merely difficult . Limits on advertising have been relaxed , allowing foreign companies to build name recognition . Jardine said the Donald bubble_gum manufacturer plastered ads on Shanghai buses , which would not have been allowed_in the 1980s . Local authorities , competing to attract foreign capital , have become more flexible in interpreting regulations . &quot; Practice is moving ahead of regulation , &quot; said Anne Stevenson-Yang , Beijing representative of the U.S.-China Business Council . &quot; You can do a lot more in the way of promoting , distributing and servicing your product than you could a_few years ago. &quot; Most important , three straight years of strong economic_growth have given many city residents more disposable_income . If China gains entry this year to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the world trade body , more barriers to foreign products and services could fall . &quot; No , you ' re definitely not looking_at 1 billion &quot; buyers , said Philip Shen , general_manager of Kraft General Foods International ' s joint_venture in Canton , which makes Maxwell House coffee . He said coffee is too expensive for most Chinese . &quot; But whatever figure you end_up with from a base like that , it ' s still going_to be quite significant. &quot; There ' s no significant competition from domestic coffee companies . Other products such_as prepared baby foods , disposable razors and dandruff shampoos didn ' t exist in China before foreign companies introduced them . Chinese companies have been quick to imitate and challenge . Daniel Loeb , general_manager of Nike International Ltd. ' s China operation , said local makers of Nike look-alike sports shoes have the advantage of lower prices and fewer distribution hassles . Foreign companies have to go_through local distributors , and many stores have limits on how many foreign brands they can stock . They also often have to pay more_than Chinese companies for electricity , staff wages and services . Bank credit is hard to get . This is where veteran foreign businessmen interrupt with tales of how they overcame far worse problems in the 1980s . One likes to tell how he bought tons of frozen shrimp for export in_order to get dollars to import equipment . If there aren ' t really 1 billion potential customers out there , is it worth it ? &quot; No question about it , &quot; said Loeb . &quot; You have to play the game. &quot;</TEXT>
