   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS : A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : OSCAR HUBBUB ; AND NOW , FOR A NOT-SO-SUBTLE VOTING REMINDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fine Line Features would like to remind academy members that Madeleine Stowe from &quot; Short Cuts &quot; was the National Society of Film Critics ' choice for best supporting actress of 1993 . The independent distributor took_out a recent ad extolling Stowe ' s award in the Hollywood trade papers . But hers is just one of 22 ensemble performances in the three-hour-plus Robert Altman-directed film that the company believes is Oscar-caliber . The film interweaves several Raymond Carver short_stories and boasts featured speaking parts for Stowe , Lily Tomlin , Lyle Lovett , Tim Robbins , Matthew Modine , Jennifer Jason Leigh , Tom Waits , Bruce Davison , Jack Lemmon , Julianne Moore . . . and on and on . As such , Fine Line has found itself in the rather costly position of having to mount an Oscar campaign for the entire cast , in addition to promotional ads for Altman and his technical crew ( editing , cinematography , music ) . To avoid having to shoulder the expense of promoting each actor individually , the New York-based company will list all actresses in one trade ad , actors in another , and the entire cast in a third one . The ads will run this week as the Oscar nomination deadline approaches . The usual practice is to promote one or two actors per movie , whether that be a critics ' favorite , such_as supporting actor Ralph Fiennes for &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; or longshots who don ' t stand a chance to win . &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; however , appears to be in a category all its own . &quot; What can we do ? &quot; asks Ira Deutchman , president of Fine Line . &quot; We didn ' t have any choice but to support all_of them . To choose among them would be impossible ; the performances are uniformly amazing. &quot; Deutchman jokes that one solution would be for the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences , whose members vote the Oscars each year , to adopt a new award category : Best Ensemble Acting in a Motion_Picture . Fearing that Fine Line might not promote him , Davison , previously nominated for best supporting actor in &quot; Longtime Companion , &quot; said his agent at William Morris paid_for an ad on his behalf . And Moore is said to have independently hired the manager of best supporting actress winner Marisa Tomei ( &quot; My Cousin Vinny &quot; ) to handle her campaign . So far , in the critics ' polls , &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; while considered by most reviewers one of the top five movies of the year , has yet to win any major U.S. awards , though in several categories has been a runner-up and was the best picture winner in the Venice Film Festival . It received one Golden Globe nomination , for best screenplay. *</TEXT>
