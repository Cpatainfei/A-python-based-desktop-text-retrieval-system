   <HEADLINE> PREP VOICES ; ON CAMPUS ; Q : HOW MUCH EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON WINNING AT THE HIGH_SCHOOL LEVEL ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; It may be politically incorrect to encourage competitive sports and emphasize winning because it is insensitive to the feelings of the loser . Wrong ! To compete and try to win is to risk losing . that ' s healthy . We must teach our young people that it is necessary and worthwhile to risk failure to make an attempt at success . An excellent lesson of competitive sports is that if you lose today , you go_back , strengthen your weaknesses , and try to win tomorrow. &quot; Joel Bruce Santa Ana * &quot; The obsession with winning is at the core of what ' s wrong with the world today . People don ' t see the relationship between competitiveness and the violence which pervades this society from top to bottom . &quot; In the world of sports , we ' re not interested in_playing or even watching a game just because we love the game , except for a_few great ( athletes ) . How many times have you seen someone switch the channel or leave the stadium because the score was 87-57 with three minutes to play . We don ' t care about the game anymore , just who wins . &quot; In life we have Watergates and Whitewaters and gang-bangers and jealous husbands and wives killing each other for the same reasons : They want to win at all costs , or because they ' re humiliated by losing . We see life as a struggle to be won or lost . &quot; Winning is not the only thing , just the final result . What we need to do is begin to look_at life and sports like music . You don ' t listen to a symphony or a single song just to hear the last note . In fact , the last note is no more important than any of the others. &quot; Waayl Salih Rancho Santa Margarita * &quot; What ' s wrong with winning ? Winning at all costs is not right ( i.e. illegal recruiting , ineligible players ) . Winning because you have a good program , good athletes , fine coaching and a winning tradition is right . No one likes to lose , period . Losing is not good . &quot; My son plays_on a winning high_school football_team , with a winning tradition , with good coaching and good athletes . We enjoy winning . I am proud that we are winners rather than losers. &quot; James Santoro Yorba Linda * &quot; The original Olympic Games ground to a shuddering halt due_to the introduction of professionalism . Does the victory of our ' Dream Team ' professionals at Barcelona ring a warning bell ? &quot; Joe McGuigan Laguna Beach * &quot; There are certain conditions as_to how much emphasis should be put_on winning . Coaches who have teams that are young and inexperienced should use practice and game time to teach fundamentals that are necessary to win games . It should not be a time for scolding and pushing kids into something that may_not be tangible at the time . Constructive criticism is the key . &quot; On the other hand , coaches who have teams with talent , experience and the desire to win should be able to push their kids to the next level of play. &quot; Scott Enrico Assistant football_coach Sunny Hills * &quot; Yes , winning is everything . But only if winning is defined in a much larger sense , both on and off the court or the field . The definition of winner must include the development of balance and perspective as well as humility , camaraderie , loyalty , respect for self and others and grace under pressure . Yes , it ' s lots of fun to take first place . But the real winner does his or her best at all times . More narrowly defining the term winner -- to refer only to the guy with the most points -- makes us all losers . The obsession with getting_ahead , no matter what the cost , weakens that sense of cohesion that is the essence of community. &quot; Karen Evarts Newport Beach * &quot; Winning is the key to success and will be the foundation of many things yet to come . It is important to our society to be the best you can be . We all must pitch_in to make winning the No . 1 priority for the kids ' sake. &quot; Abhishek Jain Esperanza freshman * &quot; Vince Lombardi ' s quote should be changed to , ' Striving to win isn ' t everything , it ' s the only thing. ' That should be the most important objective of participation . Winning will be a result of striving to win . The problem we have is that too many people are focused_on winning as opposed to the efforts to get there. &quot; Allan Pollack Santa Ana * &quot; Winning is everything , but what is winning ? In my mind , winning is mentally and physically being ready for the game and giving it all you ' ve got. &quot; Jade Jamison Marina junior * &quot; Many coaches and athletes say they are just playing sports for a good time , but it ' s a totally different story when game time comes_around . They are not out there to have fun with their opponents , they are out there to win . &quot; Without this love of winning , sports lose their pizazz and attraction , and athletes lose interest . The bottom_line is that without the will to win , sports are nothing. &quot; Jeff Hui Esperanza freshman * &quot; Winning at the high_school level should be secondary to learning the fundamentals of a sport and having fun . Winning is a byproduct of executing those learned skills . High_school should be an arena for preparing student-athletes for college or professional careers . The ultimate goal of winning as a primary emphasis should be reserved for the professional level. &quot; Eric Johnson Huntington Beach * &quot; With school choice now a reality , parents will be more likely to elect a school based on what they perceive to be the more successful sports program . Sadly , and often , the only measure of success is a school ' s win-loss record . Great athletes rarely transfer into losing programs . The successful sports program realizes that winning is not always synonymous with success , for the successful program continually meets the goals of the individual athletes , and for each the goals may be different. &quot; Jack Houston Mission Viejo * &quot; Being a member of a sports team in high_school is a realistic learning experience which educates students athletes on life itself . It offers opportunities to discover truths , such_as : -- You will receive only what you invest . -- The need and respect for authority . -- Cooperation among teammates is essential for success . -- Life isn ' t always fair . -- Everyone respects a winner . &quot; If one wants to be above average , it takes extra_time and effort . As long as integrity isn ' t compromised , winners should be held_in high esteem. &quot; Bonnie O ' Neil Newport Beach * &quot; In Indiana Coach Bob Knight ' s words , ' The will to win is not nearly so important as the will to prepare to win. ' Aside from Knight ' s periodic lapses in personal conduct , his words express the greatest lesson to be learned from competitive spots . &quot; Vince Lombardi , Mike Ditka , John Wooden and Knight all insisted on discipline and focus , without shortcuts , to achieve their goals . That applies beyond sport. &quot; Bill Seckler Corona * &quot; It ' s the spirit with which we participate in games -- as in life -- that counts far more_than winning at any cost . As long as our society keeps insisting that there is only one winner in any game -- implying that everyone else is a loser -- we will always be that ' Ugly American ' to the world . Let ' s open our eyes and see the damage we are doing ourselves. &quot; Sam Sumanth Placentia * &quot; The most important argument against focusing_on winning is that it takes the fun out of the game . Athletes should concentrate_on developing teamwork and sportsmanship . High_school players should be taught how to accept defeat gracefully . It ' s knowing that you ' ve tried your best and given it your all is what sports should be all about . There is nothing wrong with wanting to win , but not at the expense of having fun. &quot; Harmeeth Singh Uppal Esperanza freshman * &quot; Winning teaches kids to work hard to get what they want , but at_the_same_time , they should be reminded that winning isn ' t everything . Losing teaches them to work harder the next time to win . A competitive attitude should be emphasized because you need to be competitive in_order to succeed in anything you do_in life. &quot; Sabiola Nunez Huntington Beach * &quot; There ' s way too_much emphasis on winning in high_school sports . We ' re in high_school to get a education . The reality is that not many of us will be successful in sports after high_school . Kids are being falsely led to believe they ' ll be stars in pro sports just because they are in high school. &quot; Geoff King Tustin junior * &quot; High_school athletics should be a learning experience where athletes can get the fundamentals and improve themselves through play , hard work and practice . Winning games is great , but it ' s not that important at the high_school level because you ' re still improving , trying to be the best that you can be. &quot; William Martinez Fullerton * &quot; The desire to win needs to be replaced with the desire to play , learn and perform to the highest level possible at the time . Working hard at something , concentrating and improving skills should be the emphasis . When we play to our highest level , a win generally follows in sports , school and life. &quot; Marvin G .
