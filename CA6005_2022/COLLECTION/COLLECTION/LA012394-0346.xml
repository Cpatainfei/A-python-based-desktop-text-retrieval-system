   <TEXT> Fancy tying the knot with an Italian twist ? Grand Luxe International Inc. specializes in custom weddings in Italy . Founder Lisa G . Habicht of Allendale , N.J. ( who also owns Cuendet U.S.A. , which offers rental property throughout Italy ) , says she can deliver on any dream , be it an intimate ceremony in a castle in Tuscany or an elaborate party in a grand hotel . &quot; The largest wedding we ' ve done involved a bride and groom who lived_in Washington , D.C. , but had relatives all_over the world , &quot; Habicht says . &quot; The bride was from the Middle_East and the groom from Denmark . So they decided to get_married in the middle -- in Tuscany. &quot; Grand Luxe will make the usual wedding arrangements -- reception , photographer and flowers -- along with the unusual , including gondolas and 17th-Century costumes . that ' s the easy part . More important -- and far more complicated -- is cutting_through the Italian red_tape . The Italian Government Tourist Board in Los Angeles will send Americans who are considering a wedding in Italy three pages of convoluted rules and regulations . Those who have done_it themselves shudder at the memory . It takes Habicht ' s staff of three in the United States and delegates in Italy to make arrangements . Fees range from $ 500 to $ 1 # 000 , which cover faxes , telephone_calls , documentation and leg work . She prefers to have at least six months , but &quot; we ' ve done_it in four weeks. &quot; To contact Grand Luxe , call ( 201 ) 327-2333 .</TEXT>
