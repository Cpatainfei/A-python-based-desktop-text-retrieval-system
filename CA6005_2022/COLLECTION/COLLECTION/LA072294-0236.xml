   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; TIM MCGRAW : STEADY DIET OF COUNTRY CORN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tim McGraw fit right in as an attraction at the Orange County Fair . The newly minted country star ' s show Wednesday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre offered a midway ' s worth of musical junk food , but dang if the flash , the barker-blarney and the swirl of enthusiasm didn ' t make you want to swallow at least some of it . McGraw ' s 95-minute show included enough sugary fluff and drippy molasses to start his own cotton-candy and candy-apple franchises . Fortunately , his sharp , sturdy , and delightfully motley-looking backup band , the Dance_Hall Doctors , made_sure that there was some healthy protein in the diet . One of the biggest hits on the menu , &quot; Don ' t Take the Girl , &quot; was a treacle-coated corn dog of a ballad that the overflow crowd of about 9 # 000 swallowed in a gulp . McGraw sang this mechanical , bathetic potboiler about young love and young death in a stricken , fervent voice , and many of the fans sang along . Another remarkably awful ballad was &quot; Not a Moment Too Soon , &quot; the title track from McGraw ' s breakthrough album , of which millions ( two , anyway ) have been sold , just like cheeseburgers . It will be instructive to quote the entire chorus of this marvel of song-craft . Like certain fair delicacies , it consists_of almost 100 % unadulterated fat -- the cliche being the verbal equivalent of the fattiest junk food . For hack songwriters concocting commercial confections , cliches are a main ingredient , like so_much butter and cream . For critics , they are sheer heart_attack . Not a moment too soon ( cliche No . 1 ) Without a minute to spare ( 2 ) You touched my heart ( 3 ) When I didn ' t have a prayer ( 4 ) In my darkest hour ( 5 ) With my world filled with gloom ( not quite a cliche ; OK , so they put_in half an ounce of lean ) Your sweet love saved me ( 6 ) Not a moment too soon ( I think I ' m having chest_pains ) If the FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ) won ' t put warning labels on this stuff , maybe the MLA ( Modern Language Assn. ) will . The crowd sang along on this one , too . Cheeseburger , cheeseburger . Which brings us to McGraw ' s breakthrough hit , &quot; Indian Outlaw. &quot; This buffoonish ditty , a pointless , incoherent jumble of ridiculous cliches about Native_Americans is the musical equivalent of &quot; F Troop. &quot; Some Native_American groups have taken offense and called it bigoted ( the Cherokees of Southern California and the American_Indian Movement sponsored a small protest outside the fair ' s main entrance Wednesday evening before the show ) . But &quot; Indian Outlaw &quot; is too dim and scattered a work to qualify as mean-spirited . A bigot would have an opinion about Indians . To have an opinion , you have to be able to think . There is no evidence that the two Nashville songsmiths who wrote &quot; Indian Outlaw &quot; put any thought into it at all . Mindlessly , unintentionally insulting ? Yes . Bigoted ? Doubtful . Congratulations to the protesters , though . Maybe the next songwriter will remember the fuss they made and pause to think . As historical dues go , Native_Americans have paid in full and earned the right to be taken seriously , without exceptions . Novelty-seeking wags should look elsewhere for ethnic flavor . McGraw is of Irish-Italian extraction . If he wants to stay_on the same level with his next album , perhaps he can give us drunken leprechauns or a spaghetti-twirling fat man exclaiming , &quot; Mama mia ! &quot; McGraw served_up &quot; Indian Outlaw &quot; at the end of his set , without commenting on the controversy . It lifted a delighted house out of its seats . And , in fact , the live version was boisterous enough to elevate the song into the &quot; Achy Breaky &quot; category of idiocy that is kind of fun . The band threw_in some riffing from the Eagles ' &quot; Witchy Woman , &quot; as if to point_out that McGraw isn ' t the first paleface to capitalize on musical cliches culled from Hollywood oaters . * As if to set the record straight , McGraw had Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders ' 1971 pro-Indian hit , &quot; Indian_Reservation ( The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian ) , &quot; played over the sound_system just before the show started . The song is briefly quoted at the end of &quot; Indian Outlaw , &quot; but for no discernible reason . In other PC news , McGraw had an interpreter on stage to translate his show into sign_language . But since she was a long-tressed , tight-jeaned , hip-shimmying lovely who also functioned as a go-go girl , he only gets half-credit in the political-correctness department . McGraw gets full credit for effort : One had to admire his eagerness to get_across and stir_up the crowd in any way he could . He entered rump first , turning and waggling his fanny at the crowd before he ' d sung a note . But he avoided the Billy Ray Cyrus trap and kept that kind of excess in check . To get a rise , the chatty McGraw did coyote howls , led the crowd in back-and-forth yells , even trotted_out the rappers ' exhortation , &quot; Somebody scream. &quot; He didn ' t need to do all that extraneous stuff : Keeping_up a high-energy performance is enough , and the wiry , fundamentally likable singer in the too-big cowboy_hat managed that consistently -- except for a dawdling band-intro segment that temporarily stalled the show . McGraw involved the band in some of the showmanship , and an interesting cast they were . Balding , bespectacled fiddler-guitarist Bob Minner turned_up in a white shirt and a tie , looking as if he ' d just come from an office day job and hadn ' t had time to change for the gig . Opposite him was keyboards player Jeff McMahon , trailing long blond hair of Afghan_hound proportions and looking_like a refugee from a late- ' 80s Sunset Strip glam-metal band ( actually , McGraw introduced him as an ex-member of Prince &amp; the Revolution ) . Lead guitarist Darran Smith had the stocky , stubbly , seedy look of a character_actor in a crime drama , the sort of fellow the cops haul in_for interrogation , trying to get him to turn informer . All were capable players , allowing McGraw to incorporate honky-tonk , Western swing , country-rock anthems and a good , authoritatively rocking version of Earl Thomas Conley ' s 1982 hit , &quot; Somewhere Between Right and Wrong &quot; into the mix . Smith and drummer Denny Hemingson ( introduced as an Orange County resident ) leaned a bit too_much toward the rock side , but their forcefulness was_on balance a help . McGraw , who hails from Louisiana ( and is the son of one of baseball ' s biggest hams , colorful former relief_pitcher Tug McGraw ) , sang in a thin if pleasant voice with a pronounced nasal_twang . There was a bit of John Anderson in some of his sliding phrases , but he lacked the easy playfulness and depth of passion mustered by that exemplary country veteran . * McGraw sang a_couple_of new songs , one a sappy lovelorn ballad called &quot; I Didn ' t Ask And She Didn ' t Say &quot; that the audience instantly loved . Sounds like radio-ready fodder from here . The truly disheartening thing about McGraw isn ' t that he became a star by finding the lowest common_denominator of line-danceable beats and schmaltz-laden balladry . It ' s that his 1993 debut album , &quot; Tim McGraw &quot; ( from which he drew four of the set ' s 20 songs ) offered far more substantial and tasteful stuff , and flopped . It featured lots of fine picking ( often acoustic ) , and if the songs weren ' t exactly daring and poetic , most of them made believable emotional points with a measure of grace . For &quot; Not a Moment Too Soon , &quot; McGraw returned with the same producers but a far different menu of songs . Cheeseburger , cheeseburger -- more_than 2 million sold . Don ' t think he ' ll be serving that health_food again soon .</TEXT>
