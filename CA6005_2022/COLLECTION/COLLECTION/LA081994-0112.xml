   <HEADLINE> TREE RING STUDIES SUGGEST TREND OF GLOBAL COOLING SINCE 4800 BC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tree ring studies from the bristlecone_pine , the oldest living tree species , suggest that the Earth has been cooling for at least 6 # 800 years , Caltech researchers say . In a study to be published today in the journal Science , two Caltech scientists said measurements of chemical ratios in the trunks of trees grown in the White Mountains of California show that temperatures declined about 5 degrees since 4800 BC . &quot; This is consistent with other studies , such_as the ice cores , and suggests that the cooling may very well have been global , &quot; said Samuel Epstein , lead researcher in the study . But he said the research cannot be related to current theories that the Earth is warming because of the so-called greenhouse_effect caused by an increase of carbon_dioxide in the atmosphere . Epstein said the bristlecone_pine record of ancient temperatures cannot be related to any mathematical model of future changes because &quot; the modern climate is much more unpredictable. &quot; &quot; In modern times , there seems to be some mechanism that is not well understood , &quot; he said . &quot; When the climate gets a little warmer , the models go a little haywire. &quot; In the study , Epstein and a Caltech graduate_student , Xiahong Feng , measured the ratio of two chemicals , deuterium and hydrogen , in the annual growth_rings of bristlecone_pine trunks that are known to be up_to 8 # 000 years old . It is known that the ratio of deuterium and hydrogen increases in tree rings as the climatic temperature rises . A single tree ring is created annually by growth of a wood layer in the trunk . Based on measurements in 50-year intervals from three trees , the researchers found that temperatures climbed slightly until about 6 # 800 years ago and then started a long cooling slide . The trend flattened_out from 2 # 000 to 400 years ago , and then another cold period started . The coldest period was between 1700 and 1900 , with a slight warming at the end of the measured period . Epstein said the last measured season was in 1950 , the time at which the trees were cut . Wood from the trees has been preserved for scientific study because the bristlecone_pine is thought to be the longest-lived tree on Earth . Ice cores drilled from Devon Island in far northern Canada also have given long-range temperature trends , but some experts have said this data may have been influenced by the ocean or local effects . Epstein said the bristlecone_pine temperature measurements are in_general agreement with those of the ice cores , suggesting that the cooling trends recorded by the two methods may have been worldwide .</TEXT>
