   <TEXT> Bob Gallo ' s black address book is filled with crossed-out names -- the names of the dead . It has been 10 years since the controversial cancer researcher proudly announced to the world that he had found the virus that causes AIDS , a discovery for which he now shares credit with French scientists . It was a heady time for Gallo , and he was flush with optimism , confident that soon there would be a drug or a vaccine to cripple the galloping plague . &quot; Find the bug , find the drug , &quot; the theory went . Now , over a glass of lager in the oak-paneled bar of New York ' s Plaza Hotel , Gallo broods about what might have gone_wrong . He contemplates the destructive swath of a disease that , like a familiar enemy , he and countless others have spent too many years trying to outwit . He did not expect it to be this way . Villages in Africa are being wiped_out . AIDS is racing through Asia , where more_than 10 million infections are expected by the year 2000 . In the United States , 92 people die of the disease each day . For Gallo , who trained as a doctor before turning_to research , there are faces to these numbers . He recalls having dinner last year with Jesse Dobson , a well-known AIDS activist . Two weeks later , Dobson was dead . Another name crossed_out of the black address book . &quot; I feel_like we should have solved problems sooner , &quot; the virologist said somberly . &quot; Would ' ve , should ' ve , could ' ve. &quot; But didn ' t . Thirteen years after AIDS made its first_appearance in this country and a decade after &quot; the bug &quot; was found , just a handful of drugs that directly attack the virus -- AZT and three others -- are_on the market . None of them work very well , and doctors are confused about how to use them . Other new medicines have either been slow to emerge from drug_company laboratories or abandoned altogether . The prospects for a vaccine are equally dim . The wizards of genetic_engineering have been unable to work their magic into a shot that prevents AIDS neatly and efficiently . The most promising candidates have flunked laboratory tests , and six volunteers who got the high-tech injections became infected anyway , prompting the government to abandon plans for large-scale studies . The best hope for a vaccine , many scientists now say , lies_with an old-fashioned method that uses a weakened but live form of the human_immunodeficiency_virus -- a method that paradoxically may be too dangerous to test in humans . This formula worked with polio . But HIV is not that simple . It is a retrovirus , meaning it inserts its own genes into the cells of the person it infects . And it mutates rapidly , raising fears that a vaccine containing live virus could transform itself to infect the person it was supposed to protect . It is no wonder then that the days of talking_about a cure for AIDS are long gone . There isn ' t a cure in_sight . Instead , as scientists gather_in Yokohama , Japan , for the 10th annual International AIDS Conference this week , most use words such_as crisis to describe the state of AIDS research . Among researchers , a consensus has emerged : After 10 years , it is time to go_back to the drawing board . &quot; Over the past decade , ever since the discovery of the virus , there was a great_deal of effort put_in place to see if we could quickly hit a home_run , &quot; said virologist David Ho , director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Institute in New York . &quot; I think , in retrospect , that strategy is not going_to work , and did not work. &quot; Indeed , the silver bullet Gallo once hoped for has not materialized . And although government and drug_company scientists have spent the last decade trying to find one , they have yet to answer some of the most fundamental questions about HIV . Those answers may hold important clues to developing just what everyone wants -- better treatments and a vaccine . &quot; We probably know more about this virus than we do most other viruses , &quot; said AIDS researcher Steven Wolinsky of Northwestern University ' s Medical_School . &quot; But many of the basic issues are still begging to be answered. &quot; New York AIDS activist Mark Harrington puts it a bit more bluntly . &quot; We are standing , &quot; Harrington said , &quot; at the edge of a scientific black hole. &quot; Researchers do not fully understand how the AIDS virus crosses the body ' s mucous_membranes -- the linings of the mouth , vagina and anus -- to infect cells . They do not know precisely how HIV spreads inside the body . Nor do they know if certain strains of the virus are more deadly than others , nor why some people die quickly while others live for years . Also lacking is a good animal model that scientists can use to study AIDS -- a monkey , perhaps , or a chimp that could be infected with HIV and would develop the disease just as humans do . However , in Yokohama , UC San Francisco researcher Jay Levy is expected to report that he has solved this problem by using baboons . These issues are the nitty-gritty of AIDS research . If AIDS had been cured by now , there would be no need to address them ; after all , who cares about the intricacies of a disease that can be rendered powerless with drugs ? But that is not the case . And so , researchers say , they will have to learn a lot more about HIV -- perhaps the cagiest , most formidable of viruses -- before they come_up with a way to conquer it . To that end , the federal_government is shaking_up its AIDS research machine . Officials are planning to revamp the $ 1.3-billion annual AIDS budget to devote more money to laboratory studies -- basic research , in the lexicon of science -- and less to clinical research to test new treatments . It will be a plodding process , and -- barring any silver bullets -- it will probably take decades . The Activists Faced with this grim outlook , AIDS activists -- once spitting_out fire and rage -- are downtrodden , more tired than angry . Most of the movement ' s fathers are dead , and their work has been turned_over to a younger generation . Marty Majchrowicz typifies this new breed -- articulate , well educated , more realistic than optimistic . The first time he heard about AIDS he was in the eighth grade and already aware of his sexual identity . He saw the disease featured on the cover of Time magazine , saw pictures of people dying . He remembers feeling scared . He remembers thinking : &quot; I am going_to die from this one day. &quot; That was in 1981 , when AIDS was still called &quot; gay cancer. &quot; Majchrowicz obtained an undergraduate degree from USC and a master ' s degree in public health from UCLA . He puts his knowledge to good use , working as a treatment advocate at AIDS Project / Los Angeles . The slender , fair-skinned activist gives advice from a dimly lit office in APLA ' s cavernous Hollywood headquarters . Sometimes he thinks the approved AIDS drugs -- AZT , DDI , DDC and D4T -- are no better than herbal remedies ; the only difference is that these nucleoside analogues , designed to cripple the virus by keeping it from copying its genetic blueprint , have been tested . Looking_back , he said , maybe the activists themselves are to blame . &quot; We forced them into a corner , &quot; Majchrowicz said , referring to scientists and politicians . &quot; We told them , ' We want a drug. ' They gave us AZT . They put the fastest thing on the market that they could . We pushed them again and we got DDI . So here we are screaming , ' We need drugs , we need drugs , we need drugs. ' We screamed for something and we got_it . But it wasn ' t good enough. &quot; Although the expected survival time for someone diagnosed with AIDS has doubled since 1986 -- to 24 months -- this falls_short_of the five-year survival rate by which most diseases are measured . Rather , the longer survival time is mostly the result of better treatments for the various infections , such_as pneumocystis_carinii_pneumonia , that kill people whose immune_systems have been destroyed by AIDS . By contrast , government tests have failed to demonstrate conclusively that the nucleoside analogues prolong life for more_than a_few months , alone or in combination with one another . They work for only so_long and then people develop resistance . One day , Majchrowicz knows , he will have to turn_to these medicines . Like so many AIDS activists , he is HIV-positive . He is especially hopeful about an up-and-coming class of drugs -- &quot; protease inhibitors , &quot; which attack a crucial enzyme that enables HIV to reproduce inside the body . It has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration . Still , he worries that his adolescent nightmare , that he is &quot; going_to die from this one day , &quot; may come true before his own work does him any good . &quot; I feel old , &quot; he sighs . He turned 26 in March . The Researchers In a sense , the story of AIDS research is a product of a uniquely American belief : Science can do anything . Doctors have all_the answers . &quot; For decades , and maybe even half a century , the American medical machine has tried . . . to put a myth over the public that everything is within our ability to control , &quot; said Dr. Michael Wilkes , a UCLA professor of medicine . This myth has been debunked before , but faith runs deep . When President Richard Nixon declared a &quot; war on cancer &quot; in 1971 , some said the cure would be found within five years . And when , with a beaming Gallo at her side , U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler announced in 1984 that the AIDS virus had been isolated and a vaccine would be produced within two years , people believed that too . Today , significant strides have been made in preventing and treating certain types of cancers . Some childhood leukemias , for instance , have a cure rate of more_than 80 % . The advances have come as doctors learned how to put seemingly ineffective drugs together to work wonders . Even so , cancer remains the nation ' s second-leading cause of death . Nobody expects there will be a single &quot; cure for cancer &quot; anymore . Many scientists think AIDS may follow the same pattern . Among them is Dr. Harold Varmus , the new director of the National Institutes of Health . With an annual budget of $ 11 billion , NIH is the seat of medical research in this country . Its 17 institutes and six scientific centers and divisions are spread_over a hilly campus in Bethesda , Md . Varmus , a soft-spoken , slightly rumpled man who favors Oxford-cloth shirts and argyle socks , has been in_charge for eight months . He speaks thoughtfully and candidly when asked about AIDS . &quot; Right now , &quot; he said , &quot; it ' s hard for me to be optimistic about feeling that AIDS will disappear in 20 or 30 years. &quot; But , he adds , &quot; I do think that we will have drugs that are reasonably effective and that people who develop the disease AIDS will live a lot longer than they live now , but I think it is fair to say that it won ' t be so different than ( cancer ) . &quot; But there is a crucial distinction , he notes , between the two diseases . The causes of cancer , with the exception of environmental factors such_as smoking , diet and radon , are largely unknown . But there is nearly universal agreement that HIV causes AIDS . &quot; If you could eliminate the virus , you could eliminate the disease , &quot; he said . Translation : &quot; Find the bug , find the drug &quot; should have worked . &quot; That , &quot; Varmus said , &quot; is haunting us. &quot; Under his watch , NIH is shaking_up its AIDS bureaucracy . Four months ago , Varmus ousted the well-known scientist who has been the government ' s point_man on AIDS since the epidemic began -- Dr. Anthony M . Fauci -- and brought_in Dr. William E . Paul to head NIH ' s Office of AIDS Research . Paul is a highly regarded immunologist , but he has no experience in AIDS . &quot; I was looking_for somebody who would inspire a lot of confidence , who would do new things , who was_well liked , &quot; Varmus said . &quot; I was very much attracted by the idea of his being somebody who was interested in AIDS but not in the middle of it. &quot; Paul has a big job ahead . He is re-creating the Office of AIDS Research from the ground up ; the tiny agency never had any real power until last year , when -- in one of the many remarkable twists that characterize AIDS research today -- Congress reconstituted it at the urging of activists who charged that the federal research program was a mess . A Litany of Complaints This was nothing short of a revolution . It was orchestrated by a tiny band of activists / dissenters in New York . Their leader was a 33-year-old former Wall_Street bond trader named Peter Staley . Several years ago , he and his friends broke_away from ACT_UP , the group known for in-your-face protests . Figuring they could accomplish more from the inside , they formed their own group , Treatment Action Group , or TAG . They buddied up_to researchers , read grant abstracts and learned about funding streams . Then they issued three reports that caught the attention of Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and his colleagues in Congress . The reports contained a litany of complaints : Money was being spent on studies that were redundant or failed to bear fruit . No one person was in_charge of the federal AIDS budget . Top scientists in immunology and virology -- fields that have relevance to AIDS -- were not encouraged to join the fight . Promising young researchers were staying away . The AIDS Clinical Trial Group , the arm of the NIH that tests AIDS drugs , had studied AZT and the other nucleoside analogues nine ways to Sunday and had yet to come_up with good guidance for doctors , the reports said . ( The best AZT news to come_out of the government studies is that it helps prevent transmission from pregnant women to their infants. ) The research effort , the group asserted , lacked coordination and direction . &quot; It ' s written_off as , ' Well , that ' s the way science works , &quot; Staley said . &quot; I don ' t see why it has to be that way. &quot; To Staley ' s astonishment , Congress agreed . A New Game_Plan As a result , for the first time , one central authority -- the Office of AIDS Research -- controls federal AIDS research purse_strings . With this new power , Paul is drafting a plan that will put more money into basic research and less into clinical trials . The NIH spends about twice as much on clinical tests as it does on basic science . About 42 % of the government ' s AIDS budget is spent developing and testing new drugs , and 9 % is spent on vaccine research . Just 25 % is devoted to basic laboratory work . ( The remainder goes toward prevention , education and other activities. ) Paul ' s plan has not been made public , and in an interview , he declined to provide specifics , although he may do so in Yokohama . But he and Varmus acknowledged that change will take time . Much of the government ' s AIDS budget is locked_up , committed through grants that will remain in place for the next three to five years . In the meantime , he is struggling to build_up his staff -- a job fraught with obstacles because of an NIH hiring freeze -- and to familiarize himself with the disease he is supposed to help conquer . He has sought counsel from the great minds of science , among them Dr. Bernard Fields . Fields is a Harvard_University virologist who was a candidate for Paul ' s job but withdrew for health reasons . Like Paul , Fields has no experience in AIDS . At 56 , he has spent three decades studying reovirus , a member of the family of viruses that causes diarrhea . He never got_into AIDS , he said , because he did not want to abandon an established career . In May , Fields published a commentary in the scientific journal Nature that brought the crisis in AIDS research to public attention . Titled &quot; AIDS : Time to Turn_to Basic Science , &quot; the piece reads like a blueprint for Paul to follow . Ten years ago , Fields said , it was reasonable for AIDS researchers to shoot_for the moon -- a drug , a vaccine , a cure . After all , it worked with polio : The first vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk long before scientists fully understood the virus that causes the disease . With a vaccine in_hand , basic research into polio was all but abandoned . It wasn ' t necessary anymore . That approach , Fields said , hasn ' t worked for AIDS . He argues that it is time to broaden AIDS research . Scientists must learn general principles about the immune_system , he said , if they are to fully understand how AIDS attacks the body . And the way to glean such insights , Fields said , is not necessarily to study HIV . Other viruses -- rotovirus , which infects the intestines , herpes_virus and perhaps even reovirus -- might yield equally important nuggets , helping scientists to understand , for instance , how antibodies and other molecules work together to regulate immune_responses . He notes that it is easier to get grants for AIDS than any other disease . At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious_Diseases , which conducts most of government-funded AIDS research , 14 % of basic research grant requests in AIDS are approved . Only 8 % of grant requests in other diseases are funded . The Skeptics Not everyone thinks Fields , Paul and the Treatment Action Group activists are_on the right track . Dr. Robert T . Schooley is the incoming chief of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group . He thinks the criticisms of the AZT studies are too harsh . He worries that his program will be gutted just when it is_on the verge of studying new and better classes of drugs , as well as gene therapy and other innovative approaches to treating AIDS . &quot; If they kill this system . . . we may end_up killing trials that many of us think have a lot of potential , &quot; Schooley said . &quot; Then , three years from now you ' ll have people saying , ' Why didn ' t we study this ? ' &quot; Schooley is also skeptical of Fields ' argument that AIDS money should be given to scientists who don ' t work with HIV . &quot; Bernie Fields is a reovirologist , &quot; he said . &quot; Bernie ' s thesis all along has been reovirus is a great model for AIDS . Well , HIV is a great model for AIDS . Reovirus is reovirus . I worry a lot about this back to the basics ( philosophy ) coming from people who would like to have funds used on what they were doing all their professional_lives . . . . I think a lot of this is kind of self-serving. &quot; Larry Kramer is another skeptic . The playwright and AIDS activist wrote a prologue to one Treatment Action Group report , calling it &quot; one of the most important documents about the AIDS plague. &quot; Now he is furious with the organization and other activists , saying they &quot; have become so bureaucratized as_to be embarrassing. &quot; Kramer is pushing for a &quot; Manhattan_Project &quot; for AIDS -- a highly focused scientific effort like the one used to develop the atomic_bomb . Cloister the nation ' s best minds out_in the desert , this argument goes , and they will undoubtedly come_up with the answer . He calls the appointment of Paul &quot; a bad joke &quot; and said the NIH is unfit to guide scientific_research . Although many AIDS researchers -- with the notable exception of Gallo -- think the &quot; Manhattan_Project &quot; is unworkable and unnecessary , they do worry that the public will begin to think_of AIDS as a chronic , incurable problem that goes_on the back burner . And with it , they fear , will go the urgency -- and funding -- that characterized the first decade of research . &quot; This has to be viewed_as a national emergency , &quot; said Ho of the Aaron Diamond institute . &quot; Everyone senses there is a complacency setting_in , a willingness to accept the situation . But this is a transmissible disease that could get_worse if we take that attitude. &quot; An Insider ' s View Standing outside the fracas , watching with bemused detachment , is the consummate AIDS insider : Anthony Fauci . He has played several crucial roles in the battle against AIDS . He is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious_Diseases , which conducts 40 % of government-funded AIDS research . ( The remainder is spread_over the other institutes. ) He is a respected laboratory scientist who performs the kind of basic research Paul advocates . Thanks to Fauci , the theory that the AIDS virus was inactive after infecting people has been debunked . His research proved the virus can &quot; hide &quot; for years in the lymph_nodes , multiplying rapidly before waging its ferocious attack . And , until Paul ' s appointment , Fauci headed the Office of AIDS Research . If anyone can take the long view of the epidemic , it is Fauci . The walls_in his spacious office are covered with photographs that speak_to his spot in the AIDS limelight . There is Fauci with George_Bush , who once hailed him as a hero . There he is with Elizabeth Taylor , well known for her AIDS fund-raisers . And there he is peering from behind a collection of test_tubes , in People magazine , which named him one of the &quot; 25 most intriguing people of 1990. &quot; In the business of laying blame for the failures of AIDS research , Fauci has become an easy target . Staley , the founder of the Treatment Action Group , calls him &quot; a brilliant scientist and a miserable manager. &quot; Gregg Gonsalves , a founding member of the Treatment Action Group , said : &quot; When Tony walks in the room , you feel_like the king is here . It ' s like Frank Sinatra , the chairman_of_the_board . Bill Paul is very collegial . Tony never pulled_in people and said , ' OK , tell me what ' s wrong and how we should fix it. ' He was stubborn and driven . . . . ' This is my epidemic and what I say goes. ' &quot; Fauci has heard the criticism before , and he shrugs it off . &quot; There is a natural tendency to blame , &quot; he said . &quot; You blame the Reagan_Administration , you blame the Bush_Administration , and now people are blaming Bill_Clinton . Except that I have been at it longer than all_of them. &quot; He said he pushed years ago for more basic science . But nobody wanted to hear it . &quot; I wish someone would go_back to my congressional testimonies when I was saying that we need to do more to understand how the virus works , and I was getting beaten_up by the activists as well as the congressional committees . . . . Now those same people are . . . saying , ' Ah , I have seen Jesus . What we really need is more basic research. ' No kidding. &quot; Slow Progress As these debates continue , science grinds forward , step by agonizingly slow step . On the drug frontier , pharmaceutical manufacturer Hoffman-LaRoche is seeking FDA permission to market its protease inhibitor under a special program that allows AIDS drugs to be made available to patients before they are proven effective . The Treatment Action Group is fighting against the approval , arguing that it is unfair to put another drug on the market until the company can show that it works . Although tests of another new class of drugs -- the &quot; tat inhibitors &quot; -- have been shelved permanently , some scientists believe it will be possible to develop yet another type , called &quot; integrase inhibitors. &quot; All these drugs , like AZT , are antiretrovirals , designed to stop the AIDS virus from multiplying inside the body . Each targets the virus at a different stage of its replication process . Meanwhile , research continues on more innovative therapies . Among the most promising work is that being conducted by UC San Diego researcher Flossie Wong-Staal , who is exploring the possibility of gene therapy . In San Francisco , a think_tank called Project Immune Restoration is bringing scientists together to examine ways of repairing HIV-damaged immune_systems . At the National Cancer Institute , Gallo and his colleagues are studying everything from the composition of HIV ' s genes to new treatments for Kaposi ' s sarcoma , a cancer that is common among AIDS patients . He is also working_on an HIV vaccine that is being tested in France -- one of 29 vaccines in various stages of experimentation here and in Europe . There is no telling where this effort will lead . The miracle breakthrough , the magic_bullet , may still be just around the corner . Then again , it may_not . Gallo puts it this way : &quot; You could know everything about the Himalayan mountains -- evolution , caves , grounds , geography -- but you might not be able to climb them until somebody developed a new technique called a helicopter . Knowing everything there is to know about AIDS may_not make us solve the problem . It may be unsolvable . I don ' t believe that , but that is possible . Maybe we need a whole new technological development from elsewhere , maybe not even from biomedical_science . God knows from where . &quot; For some things , knowing everything may_not be enough. &quot; In the meantime , Gallo is planning his annual fall lab meeting , a seven-day retreat that functions as a mini-AIDS conference and is attended by the world ' s greatest scientific minds . The title of the opening talk , to be given by Nobel laureate and molecular biologist David Baltimore , is &quot; AIDS Research in Crisis. &quot; Each year , Gallo also invites a guest lecturer , someone from outside the scientific community , to deliver a provocative speech . This year ' s speaker is Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes . He wrote &quot; The Making of the Atomic Bomb , &quot; the definitive book on the Manhattan_Project . NEXT : The deadliest virus of all .</TEXT>
