   <HEADLINE> REISSUES : OUT OF THE VAULT AND INTO THE BIN GO OLD TREASURES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Record companies continue to exploit the treasures in their vaults , releasing scores of selections recorded as far back as the ' 20s and ' 30s . This is good news for buyers who are new_to the musical form as well as those customers looking_for a regular fix.This column looks_at several recently reissued albums . HANK CRAWFORD &quot; Heart and Soul &quot; Rhino / Atlantic Jazz Gallery * * * * A tone that communicates like someone speaking directly into your ear , a style that places emphasis on emotional warmth and blues essence -- these aspects are at the matrix of the alto saxophonist ' s ouevre . This two-CD set documents Crawford ' s 40-year career , which despite many highs , has never made Crawford a star . The first CD begins with tracks recorded with Ray Charles -- his employer in the ' 50s and early ' 60s -- then segues into cuts from several excellent small-band albums he made_for Atlantic . &quot; Misty &quot; is a nonpareil rendition of that lovely Garner ballad , phrases darting here and there , then slowing , like schools of fish in an aquarium tank . &quot; The Peeper &quot; is one of many back-beat blues , with crisp-as-a-new-dollar-bill phrases that make you want to shout . Later material , which lacks some of the do-or-die urgency of his best work , is also included -- drawn from recordings for KuDu and Milestone . The album closes with Crawford accompanying B.B. King and Etta James , the latter on the Charles classic , &quot; Night Time ( Is the Right Time ) . &quot; Albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good , recommended ) , four stars ( excellent ) . Five-star ratings are reserved for classic reissues . ZAN STEWART</TEXT>
