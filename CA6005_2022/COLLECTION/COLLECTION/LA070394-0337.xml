   <HEADLINE> SUPREME COURT ENDS TERM WITH SOUTER LEADING WAY ; JUDICIARY : HE HELPS STEER A MODERATE-TO-LIBERAL COURSE . CONSERVATIVES USUALLY FIND THEMSELVES IN DISSENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Supreme Court Justice David H . Souter , nearing the end of his court opinion that struck_down a New York law carving out a separate school district for a Hasidic sect , paused to reply to a ferocious dissent filed by his more conservative colleague , Antonin Scalia . &quot; Justice ( Benjamin N. ) Cardozo once cast the dissenter as ' the gladiator making a last stand against the lions. ' Justice Scalia ' s dissent is certainly the work of a gladiator , but he thrusts at lions of_his_own imagining , &quot; Souter said dryly . It may be hard to imagine the soft-spoken New Hampshire jurist as a lion-tamer , but perhaps the most significant trend in the court term that ended last week was Souter ' s rise to challenge the hard-charging conservatives on his right and his success in pushing them aside in most of the key cases . The result was a court increasingly likely to fashion moderate-to-liberal rulings , with Souter quietly emerging as its new leader . Lawyers on both sides of the ideological spectrum point to Souter as a growing force , a surprise for a little-known judge who was derided as the &quot; stealth candidate &quot; when then-President George_Bush nominated him in 1990 . &quot; Souter is emerging as the liberal leader in the post-Blackmun era , &quot; said Clint Bolick , counsel to the conservative Institute of Justice , referring to Justice Harry A . Blackmun , who retired after 24 years on the high_court . &quot; His stature , competence and confidence seems to grow from term to term . He is becoming a real leader , &quot; said Steven R . Shapiro , national legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union . Thanks in large part to Souter , the just-completed term was a &quot; surprisingly successful &quot; one for civil_liberties , he added . In the term that ended last Thursday , the justices interpreted the Constitution to say that religious groups may_not be given political power , that potential jurors may_not be excluded because of their gender , that the government cannot seize a home_in a drug case without a hearing , that cities cannot bar a homeowner ' s display of a protest sign and that prison officials can be forced to pay damages if they deliberately ignore a clear risk to the health of their inmates . In cases involving federal laws , the justices made_it easier for victims of sexual_harassment to win damages from their employers , said abortion protesters who use violence can be sued under an anti-racketeering law and ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 does not apply to cases that were pending before it was enacted . For conservatives , the biggest victories came_in the area of property_rights . The Constitution does not allow officials to demand a piece of property in exchange for a building_permit , the court said on a 5-4 vote , unless they can prove this exaction is closely linked to the burden imposed by the expanded development . In addition , the court insisted that state judges examine a jury ' s punitive-damage award to make_sure the amount is not excessive . Souter ' s growing strength may be especially important as the court undergoes transition . Thursday marked the last_day for the 85-year-old Blackmun . If all goes as expected , he will be replaced in October by President Clinton ' s second nominee , Judge Stephen G . Breyer of Boston . In May , White_House Counsel Lloyd N . Cutler boasted that Breyer had the experience and skill to be a coalition builder on the high_court . But privately , some Administration attorneys admit that Souter is likely to be a stronger , more effective voice in behalf of civil_rights and individual liberties . In her first term , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg followed a moderate-to-liberal approach similar to Souter ' s . Along with Breyer and veteran John Paul Stevens , the four could form a solid coalition . Just a_few years ago , it looked as though the rapid succession of new conservative appointees could push the high_court sharply to the right . Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush said they wanted to see the court reject the right to abortion , permit prayer in schools and cut_back on the rights of criminal defendants . In William H . Rehnquist , they had a chief_justice committed to those goals . But several Reagan-Bush appointees have disappointed conservatives : Souter in particular and Anthony M . Kennedy to some degree . In June , 1992 , they stunned their conservative colleagues by joining with Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor to strongly reaffirm the Roe vs . Wade ruling on abortion rights and to strike_down a public_school graduation prayer that was led by a cleric . Since then , the court has steered a mostly center course , if anything moving slightly left . More often than not , the strict conservatives -- Scalia , Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas -- find themselves in dissent . Scalia , 58 , has only one real follower : Thomas , who turned 46 last week . They vote together in nearly every significant case . Lacking a following , Scalia revels in firing_off vitriolic dissents that deride the majority_opinion as being illogical and unfaithful to the Constitution . Where Scalia is fond of writing long , historical opinions that bolster his conservative stands , Souter counters with equally detailed historical examinations , but with a different conclusion . In the past two years , for example , he has authored opinions citing 18th-Century history to show that the framers of the Constitution did indeed seek a separation of church and state , not just a ban on official state churches , as Scalia and Rehnquist maintain . Last week ' s ruling in the Hasidic case renewed the fight . In dissent , Scalia devoted 23 pages to slamming Souter ' s majority_opinion : his &quot; manipulation &quot; of the facts , his &quot; steamrolling &quot; of key distinctions , his &quot; facile conclusions &quot; and his ultimate judgment &quot; disfavoring religion. &quot; In two pages , Souter rebutted him with a deft touch . Scalia ' s stand would be easier to accept , he said , if his &quot; position had prevailed with the framers and with this court over the years. &quot; Calling Scalia &quot; blind to history as well to precedent , &quot; Souter said the court will continue to insist that &quot; singling_out a particular sect for special treatment &quot; violates the Constitution . Scalia had the votes of Thomas and Rehnquist , while Souter spoke_for the six-member majority . Four years ago , most predicted Souter would join the conservatives . Not only was he a Bush appointee , but he had been recommended highly by Bush ' s conservative Chief_of_Staff John H . Sununu , a former New Hampshire governor . But ex-clerks and friends note that Souter takes seriously his role as replacing Justice William J . Brennan , the longtime champion of the Bill of Rights who retired in 1990 . The two lunch together often , friends say . To be sure , Souter is no Brennan-style liberal . Where Brennan opposed capital_punishment as flatly unconstitutional , Souter usually votes to uphold death sentences so_long as the rules were followed . Souter , unlike Brennan , also favors carefully nuanced decisions . For example , faced with a lawsuit filed by a transsexual prisoner who had been sexually assaulted behind bars , Souter rejected both the liberal and conservative approaches and then set_forth a middle-ground standard . Wardens cannot be responsible every time an inmate gets hurt , he said , but neither can they be absolutely immune from liability when they knowingly and deliberately place an inmate in grave danger . In March , he authored an opinion for the court that balanced the rights of a copyright holder against those of an artist who wrote a parody of a popular song . Adopting a step-by-step approach , Souter explained the four factors that determine when a work is a &quot; fair use &quot; and when it goes too far and violates a copyright . There are no sounds_bites in a typical Souter opinion . He can be turgid writer , and sometimes both sides claim victory after reading his decision . But his careful approach also draws the support and respect of his fellow justices . Only Thomas dissented in the prisoner ' s case , and the opinion in the copyright case was signed by all nine members . Soon after he arrived in the fall of 1990 , Souter seemed overwhelmed by the job . But as a bachelor with few social friends in Washington , he was able to plunge wholeheartedly into the work of the court . While not exactly a young bachelor at 55 , Souter is just coming_into his prime years on the court . But already , he has proven to be far more_than first advertised . Says Carter Phillips , a Washington attorney who practices before the court : &quot; This was a guy who came_in as an unknown from nowhere . But ultimately , I think he will prove to the most important one up there. &quot; Key Supreme Court Rulings Here are some of the key rulings during the 1993-94 term .
