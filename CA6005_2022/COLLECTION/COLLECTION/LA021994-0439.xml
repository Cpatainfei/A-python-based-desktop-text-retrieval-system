   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; SUSPENSEFUL , HISTORICAL ' RACE TO FREEDOM '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Race to Freedom : The Underground_Railroad &quot; is terrific TV for young viewers unfamiliar_with the United States ' pre-Civil War racial history . And for older audiences familiar_with the saga of blacks escaping to Canada and outwitting the clutches of the repugnant 1850 Fugitive Slave Act , this production is as suspenseful , if not as lavish , as historical drama on TV usually gets. ( It airs at 8 tonight on two cable outlets -- the Family Channel and BET. ) Following in the tradition of &quot; Roots &quot; and &quot; The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman , &quot; &quot; Race to Freedom &quot; is the story of four slaves fleeing a North Carolina plantation for Canada , the &quot; promised land , &quot; where bounty hunters can ' t legally touch them . Traveling_by night on the so-called underground_railroad -- in_essence a network of friendly , above-ground shelters identified by candles burning in the windows -- the runaway slaves beat a desperate path to the Ohio_River , where they encounter the underground_railroad ' s real conductor , Harriet Tubman , who puts them on a genuine train for the Canadian border , where more trauma awaits . Shot in Ontario and co-starring Janet Bailey as a young plantation housekeeper reluctant to face the perils of freedom and Courtney Vance as her gritty fiancee , the movie is tightly directed by Don McBrearty from a compelling teleplay by Diana Braithwaite , Nancy Botkin and Peter Mohan . Sure , the creators take some romantic license but hardly enough to tarnish the project . Bailey shines in her growth from docility to heroism , and the movie features flinty supporting performances ( among them Dawnn Lewis ' powerfully etched runaway , Glynn Turman ' s chilly bounty hunter and executive producer Tim Reid ' s Frederick Douglass . The show resourcefully captures the 1850s with minimal production sophistry , and it ' s enriched by Melba Moore ' s soaring off-screen vocal motif of &quot; Oh , Freedom. &quot;</TEXT>
