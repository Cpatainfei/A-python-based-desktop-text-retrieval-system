   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; BRITISH VISITORS PICK HOLLYWOOD ' S BRAIN ; FILM : DESPITE A FLOOD OF LOCATION WORK , U.K. INDUSTRY IS SHRINKING . GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO TURN THINGS AROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the country where Shakespeare flourishes , movies don ' t . Despite an overwhelming number of Oscar nominations last year for such critical successes as &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; and &quot; The Remains of the Day , &quot; and a current flood of big-budget period films set_in the United Kingdom , the_British film_industry is flagging at best . As indigenous investment in its movies continues to decline , British film is shrinking in the shadow of Hollywood productions that are luring away its actors , directors and production crews and eating_up the lion ' s share of its growing theatrical market . In a new effort by the_British government to hunt_down the Grail of a profitable film business , several members_of_Parliament paid a quiet visit to Los Angeles last month to pick Hollywood ' s brain . During the visit , which sharply contrasted with Prince Charles ' recent whirlwind tour of Los Angeles , the group held a tightly scheduled week of private meetings with many of the industry ' s most influential players -- including director Steven Spielberg , International Creative Management Chairman Jeff Berg , MCA Chairman Lew R . Wasserman , Motion_Picture Assn . of America President Jack Valenti and digital wizard George Lucas in San Rafael . The agenda : to learn about everything from movie financing to production and distribution . &quot; The group was meeting people in the industry and trying to find the best way to revive the U.K. both as a producing country and a country of locations and facilities , &quot; said Peter Rawley , head of the international department at ICM and a chief organizer of the visit , which was timed to coincide with the two-month UK / LA festival of British Arts that ends next Monday . Michael Fabricant , one of the seven visiting members of the_British National Heritage Select Committee , whose other tasks include steering the future of the_British Broadcasting Corp. , said he considered the trip a success . &quot; It was a very , very good and worthwhile visit , &quot; he said . &quot; It gave us a huge insight into the working of cinema in Los Angeles. &quot; * The group will formally present its findings to the_British government early next year . Ironically , the trip comes as Britain is enjoying a boom in location work with the filming of such big-budget movies as the independent production &quot; Judge Dredd , &quot; starring Sylvester Stallone ; TriStar Pictures ' &quot; Mary Reilly , &quot; co-starring Julia Roberts and John Malkovich , and Columbia Pictures ' &quot; First Knight , &quot; starring Sean Connery . Those films will help boost the total investment in British movies to a projected $ 656 million in 1994 , more_than an 80 % increase over 1993 , according to the London-based British Film Institute . But observers say the figure is merely a temporary surge due_to current interest in period films . Another drag_on the industry is the fact that most of the financing for British films comes from U.S. or other foreign investors , which means the_British economy sees very little return . In 1993 , U.S. or other non-British financing was either &quot; significantly &quot; or entirely behind 37 of the year ' s 69 British films , representing 82 % of the year ' s $ 361.5 million in film production , according to figures from the_British Film Institute to be released this week . One such film was last summer ' s blockbuster &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; which PolyGram says took_in $ 225 million in international box_office revenue . The film , hailed as a big British success , was actually financed by the German unit of Dutch-owned media giant PolyGram , so a significant percentage of the revenue went_to Germany . &quot; Part of the problem is that people in the U.K. have never really taken the film_industry too seriously , &quot; Fabricant said . &quot; I think a major part of our task is to create a financial environment wherein the financial industry in England realizes that filmmaking isn ' t just glamour , it can be made into a major export earner. &quot; Such skepticism in the London financial market has meant that film success has been sporadic . The occasional box_office hit hasn ' t led to further investment , causing critics to scoff at the idea that an &quot; industry &quot; even exists in Britain . &quot; Steven Spielberg said to us , you ' ve got all this talent . . . . You ' d have a marvelous industry if you had an industry , &quot; Fabricant said . The aim , Fabricant said , is to &quot; get_away from the idea of producing a series of one-offs . We have to produce a portfolio of films just like a stockbroker produces a portfolio of shares. &quot; The building of a healthy indigenous industry is at least a_few years off . But the parliamentary committee ' s fact-finding trip has spurred some hope . &quot; I would expect to see some positive action by the ( British ) government within the next two years , &quot; said ICM ' s Rawley . &quot; I think the visit shows a willingness by the government to look_at the problem seriously. &quot;</TEXT>
