   <TEXT> Even in a land where heated dipsticks , thermal underwear and glove liners are routine , this has been a winter to remember . The Coast Guard has broken more Great Lakes ice so far this season than in the last three winters combined . All-time low_temperatures have been recorded in 16 American cities . So_much snow has fallen_in both the Midwest and the East that salt_mines are operating 24 hours a day , seven days a week , to supply road crews with the ice-melting mineral . &quot; Our people have had only four days_off since Thanksgiving , &quot; said Bruce Higgins , manager of an Akzo Salt Inc. plant that mines deposits under Lake Erie . His is important work . In the metropolis where a mayor who couldn ' t keep the streets clear lost his job in 1979 , a Chicago Tribune headline writer declared a &quot; salt crisis &quot; Thursday . While aldermen complain about the cost of replenishing stockpiles , Mayor Richard M . Daley proved he knows his history . &quot; The people want their salt , &quot; he told reporters . The state of Pennsylvania even sent its National_Guard to a mine in Upstate New York to speed the precious stuff on its way . Stunning in its breadth , tenacity and severity , this wicked weather has put one question on millions of frozen lips : How are we ever going_to get_through this ? If nothing else , the winter of ' 94 is good for the art of conversation . For years to come , the local raconteurs will tell of the &quot; igloo effect &quot; in Bethlehem , Pa. ; the run_on groceries in Louisville , and the practical man in Antioch , Ill. , who robbed a bank and escaped by snowmobile . The winter of ' 94 was the season a Chicago woman was found frozen , kneeling , but alive , on her floor . Temporary dams of ice chunks on rivers in West_Virginia and Ohio created frigid floods -- there will be more , hydrologists promise , with the advent of the thaws . More_than 100 deaths , from snow-shovelers ' heart_attacks to cases of exposure suffered by the homeless , have been blamed on this year ' s onslaught . &quot; This was a bad shot of cold air . . . nothing more_than chaotic random nature , &quot; said John Christy , an atmospheric scientist at University of Alabama in Huntsville . But as he spoke , he gazed out his office window at an ice-entombed tree . &quot; I don ' t know how to get home , &quot; he sighed . Some portions of the country have actually enjoyed milder weather than usual . The Pacific Northwest , for example , is in the midst of its second warmest winter ever . Temperatures in the West and Southwest have been pleasant as well . But for the last month , a goodly section of the nation has been shivering , slipping and sneezing . On Thursday alone , the storm line stretched from the Gulf Coast to New England , with ice-slick roads delaying the proceedings in two widely-publicized Texas cases : the Branch Davidian cult trial in San Antonio and selection of a jury in Ft . Worth to hear the ethics charges against Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison . Up to four inches of ice coated north and east Texas roadways , virtually paralyzing the Dallas-Ft . Worth area and snarling traffic as far south as San Antonio and Houston . New York City feels particularly beleaguered , with 11 snow storms so far . ( The Northeast winter is the third coldest in history , as well ) . The Dakotas have been hit hard too . As for the future , Weather Service meteorologist David Miskus forlornly predicts &quot; no real letup this month. &quot; He expects temperatures near normal on the East Coast but below normal in the Midwest and Upper Midwest . The worst freeze hit in mid-January , when a reading of 27 degrees below zero_in Indianapolis broke a record set_in 1894 . That may sound impressive , particularly to Californians . But at Devil ' s Lake , N.D. , technically two degrees warmer , the torrents of whipping air made_for an inhuman windchill reading of 92 below . The town of 9 # 500 is 100 miles west of the state border with Minnesota and close to the geographic center of North_America . But it felt more like the furthest reaches of the Arctic . At the_Devil ' s Lake fire_station , Chief Bill Oehlke took it all_in stride . &quot; It ' s not a big hassle , &quot; he said . &quot; Everyone knows what to do here. &quot; That day , responding to a water_main break , firefighters mummified themselves inside face_masks , Air Force-style flight suits and Gore-tex parkas . The freeze rendered their water_gauges inoperable . &quot; The nice thing about having to go_out in this kind of weather , &quot; Oehlke said , &quot; is you don ' t hang_around the scene once you ' re finished. &quot; In relatively more temperate climes , no one was nearly as blase . Washington , D.C. , shut_down for several days last month , as the federal_government told all non-essential employees to stay home . Power_companies in the East , unused_to the huge demand for heat , struggled to keep_up . Maple Glen , an affluent subdivision north of Philadelphia , was one place where the electric utilities failed . On two different weekends , Sue Klauder , her husband and her 3-month-old felt_like pioneers . Their house has gas heat -- but electric thermostats . They went_through half a cord of firewood in a_few days , but the blaze kept only their living_room warm . They had a kerosene_heater , &quot; but my husband had to drive four places to get kerosene , &quot; Klauder said . With the refrigerator out_of_commission , they stored their meat in coolers out_in the snow and their milk and eggs in the ground . At night , retrieving the makings for a meal , they could watch blue flashes -- power surges -- spark from the transformer boxes_in their neighbors ' yards . At one point , 600 # 000 out of 1.5 million Philadelphia Electric Co . customers were blacked_out . The weather problem in Bethlehem , further north , was dubbed the &quot; igloo effect. &quot; When cook fires are built_in the ice domes , water begins to drip down the interior walls . Similarly , when houses are buried under ice , warmth penetrates attic insulation . Water from melting snow and ice , blocked from running_off the roof by more snow and ice , sinks through the roof and into the house . Leon Murphy thought one of his water_pipes had burst and called a plumber . &quot; He told me we needed a roofer , &quot; Murphy said . Water had picked_up the shingles on his seven-year-old roof , buried under 18 inches of snow . He had to drill_holes in his ceiling and walls to let the moisture out . His roofer told him to call_back for repairs after the snow was all gone . That is why , all_over town , hand-scrawled signs now advertise : &quot; Will Shovel Snow Off Roofs. &quot; Last month , Louisville reeled from an 18-inch snowfall . It was not the first time ; 16 inches dropped on the city in 1978 . But the region was unprepared nonetheless . Normal car_traffic was impossible . With most supermarkets closed , customers besieged any outlet where they could find basic supplies . &quot; We had 300 calls_in one day asking if we were open , &quot; said Larry McCandless , who owns a gasoline_station and grocery on Louisville ' s west_side . &quot; They completely ravaged our store , took everything -- bread , milk , chips , you name it . We did four times the amount of business we ' ve ever done_in a single day. &quot; In Antioch , Ill. , a man on a snowmobile pulled_up to the drive-in window at a bank on Tuesday , displayed what appeared to be a pipe_bomb , and demanded cash . He roared_off into blizzard conditions after scooping_up an undetermined amount_of_money put_in the drawer by the frightened teller . By the time police negotiated snowbound roads in response to the alarm , the robber was long gone , his tracks disappearing under new snow . &quot; He was just an opportunist , &quot; groused Lake County Sheriff ' s Lt . Chet Iwan . In Chicago , a bastion of cold_weather , the veterans of winter are_better equipped . Letter_carrier Kevin Henaghan trudged his 13-block route through the western suburbs swaddled in every piece of clothing the U.S. Postal Service issues except the summer shorts . He wore long thermal underwear , pants , a shirt , a lined jacket , a down parka , regular socks , thermal socks , lined boots and a regulation ski_mask . All that could be seen of his features were pale blue eyes through puffs of frozen breath . On his rounds on a recent day where the windchill plunged to minus-60 , he declined the coffee that his customers kept offering . Like his car , which he ' d left running , he said , &quot; If I stop , I won ' t start again. &quot; All around Chicago , hardware_stores know to stock a variety of gadgets to combat the freeze . Starting fluid to thaw out engine_blocks . Gasoline anti-freeze to keep the fuel_lines clear . Electrically heated dipsticks -- plug them in and keep them in the crankcase overnight to keep the engine oil from sludging up . Lock de-icer is a staple . Plastic double-face tape keeps the chill from creeping past the window ' s edge . At Dressel ' s Ace Hardware_store in Oak Park , Ill. , owner Ron Rogers watched the merchandise move with satisfaction during the worst of the cold . Behind the steamed-up windows , a cashier near the door wore gloves while she worked the register . &quot; So_much , &quot; Rogers said , &quot; for the greenhouse effect. &quot;</TEXT>
