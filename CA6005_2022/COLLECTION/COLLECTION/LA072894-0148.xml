   <HEADLINE> POSTCARD : ST . PETERSBURG ; BELLS SOUND REBIRTH OF LUTHERAN_CHURCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a walk down this city ' s million-ruble mile , Nevsky Prospect , one cannot help but notice , just behind the Koff beer garden , a magnificent early 19th-Century Lutheran_church with two bell_towers and a cross that dates_back to , oh , about June 29 . From this church once emanated some of the world ' s most inspiring music , played_on a famous organ that since has disappeared . The sound one hears now is of jackhammers . A look inside reveals an Olympic-sized swimming_pool . One also sees a lot of dust as construction workers labor to remove the pool and convert the main floor back into a chapel . This is being financed by the World_Council of Lutheran_Churches , which , in its pleas for donations , calls the project the &quot; Reconstruction of the Swimming Pool Church. &quot; The original name , St . Peter ' s Lutheran , might have been more reverent , but let ' s face it , it does not get your attention like Swimming Pool Church . According to the church ' s youth pastor , Markus Eisele , German laborers who were recruited to help Peter the Great build this city in 1704 established the first Lutheran_church in St . Petersburg . St . Peter ' s was built_in 1838 and at one time had 17 # 000 members . But religion was discouraged after the 1917 revolution . In 1938 , St . Peter ' s pastor , the last of the Lutheran faith in St . Petersburg , was deported , and his church became a warehouse for fruits and vegetables from nearby collective_farms . Twelve years later , it was converted into a swimming_pool that , over the next three decades , served as the site for numerous national and international competitions . The pool , however , eventually fell_into disrepair , and in 1991 , with the fall of Communism , the building was returned to the Lutherans . Eisele , of Heidelberg , Germany , said they found a_few faithful in the city as the religion was surreptitiously kept alive by their parents and grandparents . They also found that the four bells in the towers sounded as joyful as ever , perhaps more . They were the only ones in the city that were not melted_down for munitions during World_War_II . &quot; We like to think it was because of the Grace of God , &quot; said Mike Byerley of Houston , one of 93 Lutherans here from Texas to assist with the reconstruction . On June 29 , when the church was reopened for daily prayer_services in a small room off the foyer and the new cross was erected , the bells were heard throughout the city for the first time in seven decades .
