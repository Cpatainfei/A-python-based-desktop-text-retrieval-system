   <HEADLINE> ISRAELIS CHEER JORDANIAN KING ' S FIRST PUBLIC VISIT ; MIDEAST : AT A CEREMONY IN GALILEE REGION , HUSSEIN AND RABIN SIGN RATIFIED COPIES OF PEACE PACT . A NEW BORDER CROSSING IS OPENED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A beaming King Hussein , making his first public visit to Israel , stepped_out of a helicopter Thursday into a throng of cheering schoolchildren waving Israeli and Jordanian flags . Surrounded by a phalanx of security men , the Jordanian monarch walked several hundred yards here at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee alongside Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , down a road lined with hundreds of ecstatic children and watchful soldiers . &quot; Hussein ! Hussein ! &quot; the children shouted . Some sang &quot; Havenu Shalom Aleichem , &quot; a popular Israeli song of welcome and peace . Buffered by the security men , Hussein had little physical contact with the children . But his less tightly guarded brother , Crown_Prince Hassan , earned squeals of delight from the children when he reached_into the crowd to shake hands . &quot; It ' s like a dream come true , &quot; said Betty Fessler , 50 , who immigrated 12 years ago from Pasadena to Kibbutz Massada , half a mile from the Jordanian border . &quot; Hussein is a very , very sensible leader , very pragmatic . I think he is probably even happier about this than we are. &quot; &quot; We ' ve been looking_for this moment for a long_time , &quot; said Tali Tal , a teacher who lives_on a cooperative farm in the Galilee region . Tal brought her two daughters , 15-year-old Hadar and 10-year-old Zohar , to see the king . &quot; I was 10 years old in 1967 , and I remember the war then , &quot; Tal said . &quot; There were bombs dropping all around , and we were in a hole in our garden . &quot; To come from there to here , &quot; she said , shaking her head in disbelief . &quot; All my life , I have wanted peace . It is very easy for me to welcome the king . There are no hard feelings. &quot; Hussein ' s contact with non-official Israelis was brief . His short walk led to the manicured grounds of Beit Gabriel , a cultural center_on the shores of the Sea of Galilee built by Geta Sherover , a wealthy philanthropist . &quot; Mrs . Sherover had a vision , &quot; said Anat Fonarov , general director of Beit Gabriel . &quot; She thought that one day , we will host here our neighbors . Now , we are waiting for ( Syrian President Hafez ) Assad to come. &quot; At a gilt-edged table on the lakeside , in the mellow glow of a late afternoon sun , Hussein and Rabin signed ratified copies of the Israeli-Jordanian peace_treaty first signed Oct . 26 in the Arava desert , with President Clinton as a witness . The Jordanian Senate ratified the treaty Wednesday . Thursday morning , four hours before Hussein and Rabin met , the two nations opened a new border crossing over the Jordan_River about 60 miles north of Jerusalem . The Jordanians call the crossing the Sheik Hussein Bridge ; the Israelis call it the Jordan_River Bridge . Citizens of the two nations will be able to obtain visas and cross freely in another week . Ambassadors are expected to be exchanged within a month . A team of senior officials from the Israeli Foreign Ministry plans to travel next week to Amman , the Jordanian capital , to search for a site for the Israeli Embassy and to finalize arrangements for issuing visas . &quot; I thank God the almighty for blessing us both with the ability to see our long and objective march through to its conclusion , &quot; Hussein said in a brief speech after the ratification . Stepping to the podium after the king , Rabin turned toward the monarch as he spoke . &quot; I believe our aspiration is to achieve a comprehensive peace , for the purpose of having an entirely different Middle_East , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; You led your country with courage , imagination and vision . You led your country and your people under difficult times . It is a day when we celebrate together. &quot; Rabin said he hoped that Syria and Lebanon will soon follow Jordan in making_peace with Israel . The two leaders then held a brief working meeting but no news_conference . Hussein wanted to keep the session low-key , according to Jordanian officials , because the treaty continues to draw criticism in Jordan . Islamic fundamentalists there and elsewhere in the region say the treaty failed to secure Jordan ' s rights and that it grants Israel too many economic advantages in trade with Jordan . Other Jordanians also have criticized the accord . Ahmed Obeidat , a former prime_minister and staunch supporter of the regime , resigned from his Senate seat -- to which he was appointed by Hussein -- on Wednesday to protest the treaty . The Israeli-Jordanian pact also has been criticized by Palestinians , who fear that Israel and Jordan are making decisions without their participation that ultimately will affect the 1.2 million Palestinians living_in the West_Bank and East Jerusalem . Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat -- who has been_on bad terms with Hussein for months -- reached_out to the king Wednesday night , telephoning him for the first time since Arafat moved to Gaza in July to head the self-governing Palestinian Authority there . &quot; It was decided that contacts between them would continue , &quot; said Nabil abu Rudeineh , a spokesman for Arafat . Palestinian officials said Arafat may travel_to Amman soon to meet with Hussein . The two have publicly sniped at each other recently over who should protect Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem , and over the nature of future ties between the Palestinian-run territories and Jordan . It was no accident , Israeli analysts said Thursday , that Hussein decided to make his first visit to Israel one to an obscure site in the north . He stayed far away from Jerusalem , where Palestinians are sharply critical of him and might have publicly protested his visit .</TEXT>
