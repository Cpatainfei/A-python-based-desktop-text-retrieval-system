   <TEXT> * We are the United States of America . Even though we have the right to speak our ancestors ' languages and practice their religions and traditions , it is our duty to learn to communicate in the tongue of our adopted country .

Please learn English before the next disaster . JAY STOVALL Woodland Hills</TEXT>
