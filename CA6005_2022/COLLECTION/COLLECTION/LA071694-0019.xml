   <HEADLINE> IN PUZZLING MOVE , N . KOREA POSTPONES KIM FUNERAL ; SURPRISE : SOUTH IS ASTONISHED . NORTH SAYS RITES DELAYED TWO DAYS TO COPE WITH THE LARGE_NUMBER OF MOURNERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move that astonished and puzzled South_Korean leaders , North_Korea today abruptly postponed a state funeral for President Kim Il Sung from Sunday to Tuesday . Radio Pyongyang , monitored here , said the decision was made to cope_with an increasing number of North_Korean mourners who wish to pay their respects_to the only leader the Stalinist nation ever knew in its 46-year history . Kim , 82 , died of a heart_attack July 8 . Kim ' s body , encased in a crystal casket surrounded by flowers , has been lying_in state in the presidential palace in Pyongyang since Monday night , when his son and heir_apparent , Kim Jong Il , 52 , led top officials to pay the first round of respects . Lee Hong Koo , South_Korea ' s minister of unification , said North_Korea may have postponed the funeral &quot; to maximize the feelings of ( the North_Korean people who want to ) cherish the memory of their late leader to smooth the succession of power. &quot; But he added , &quot; We have no intelligence reports that the transfer of power to Kim Jong Il is in trouble. &quot; He spoke after South_Korean Cabinet_ministers met to discuss North_Korea . The North_Korean Central News_Agency said the move reflected the &quot; ardent feelings and demand of the people &quot; to pay respects . &quot; The number of mourners is ever increasing. &quot; Mourners will be allowed to pay respects through Monday , Radio Pyongyang said . The news_agency said the funeral organizing committee , headed by Kim Jong Il , decided to stage a large memorial rally the day after the funeral . The postponement only a day before the funeral promised to cause major logistic trouble in Pyongyang . No details have been announced about plans for the funeral , but the Communist nation always held extravaganza-proportion celebrations of Kim ' s birthdays in which tens of thousands of North_Koreans staged performances . The move came a day after the Japanese government , in a white_paper on defense , for the first time called the development of North_Korean weaponry a grave threat to Japan . Japan ' s Cabinet approved the long-planned annual defense_policy paper eight days before Socialist Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama is to visit Seoul . The report said North_Korea is believed to have acquired chemical and biological weapons and is suspected of developing nuclear bombs to go_along with a proven missile capacity . &quot; The situation on the Korean_peninsula has become a grave destabilizing factor for the security of East Asia , including Japan , &quot; the report said . It noted that in May , 1993 , North_Korea successfully test-fired a missile with a range of 620 miles , meaning the device would be capable of striking Osaka , Japan . Pyongyang also is believed to be working_on a longer-range version that could reach Tokyo and most of the rest of Japan . &quot; If the development of nuclear_weapons is matched by the development of missiles , this could pose a more dangerous situation , &quot; the white_paper said . Hirotsugu Ota , counselor at the Defense Agency in Tokyo , said Japan &quot; would have to consider measures in the future if North_Korea went_ahead with its missile development. &quot; He did not elaborate , but his statement apparently referred to the development of an anti-missile system . The United States has offered to work with Japan to produce weapons capable of shooting_down incoming missiles . Earlier this year , the Japanese government declared that Tokyo would not seek a nuclear arsenal of its own even if North_Korea developed nuclear_weapons . Pyongyang , meanwhile , resumed propaganda attacks on South_Korea by condemning Seoul for ordering a military alert immediately after the announcement last Saturday of Kim ' s death and for banning its citizens from offering condolences . It compared the alert order with &quot; rashly igniting a fire at a funeral home. &quot; &quot; Far from sharing sorrow at the unexpected misfortune on the threshold of North-South summit talks , the South_Korean authorities abused ( Kim ' s death ) politically and provoked their fellow countrymen ( in the North ) who have lost the leader of the nation , &quot; the North_Korean Central News_Agency commented . It said that South_Korean President Kim Young Sam , who had been scheduled to meet the North_Korean dictator July 25-27 in Pyongyang , &quot; cannot be called a human_being , still less a politician. &quot;</TEXT>
