   <HEADLINE> EXXON SPILL ENDS_UP TARNISHING IMAGE OF SCIENCE ; ECOSYSTEM : AS THE LITIGATION WORE ON , SCIENTISTS WATCHED IN SILENCE . NOW THEY STAND BAFFLED OVER WHAT STEPS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT ALASKA ' S FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alaska ' s 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill left a little-noticed but costly residue : tarnished scientific reputations and a mass of uncoordinated data that will be of scant use in measuring the spill ' s long-term effects on the ecosystems of Prince William Sound . Scores of science projects were launched to prove or disprove damage claims . While lawyers battered each other with carefully selected facts , scientists watched in silence , forbidden to communicate their work to the public or even to each other . The stakes -- and the payoff -- were astronomical . On Sept . 16 , an Anchorage , Alaska , jury levied a $ 5-billion punitive judgment against the Exxon Corp . The company already had paid_out $ 2.8 billion in cleanup costs , criminal penalties and civil damages to state and federal agencies , fishermen and Alaskan natives . &quot; Many well-known scientists who did outstanding work before the spill now find that their reputations have been tainted -- that they were used as mouthpieces , &quot; said Gary Shigenaka , a marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ' s ( NOAA ) biological assessment team in Seattle . The team is at the midpoint of a 10-year study of the sound . &quot; We can never go_back to the days when scientists exchanged information , &quot; Shigenaka said . &quot; Exxon Valdez is the template for things to come . Now we will have science by press conference. &quot; * How selectively the facts were used was demonstrated in August , when a jury heard scientific testimony that disastrous pink salmon harvests in 1992 and 1993 were possibly due_to the oil spill . As jurors deliberated , they were not permitted to learn that a harvest of almost 37 million fish was in_progress -- the third largest in Prince William history . &quot; We have real misgivings about applying data on oil to salmon , &quot; Shigenaka said . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s a salmon scientist out there who ' d rest his case on an oil injury to salmon. &quot; NOAA is charged with providing unbiased scientific information to assist spill-response organizations in handling emergencies . Frequently , the agency winds_up in the middle . &quot; We performed a study of subsistence seafood utilized by native populations -- a major effort -- and found that salmon and halibut were free_of hydrocarbons , &quot; Shigenaka said . &quot; Most hydrocarbons were found in Kodiak Harbor , from diesel_fuel . Nevertheless , a jury awarded $ 20 million to Alaska natives for damage to their food supply. &quot; That was only slightly more_than the $ 18.3 million Exxon spent to rehabilitate 222 oil-drenched sea_otters -- about $ 80 # 000 per animal . A different set of facts applies to Prince William Sound herring , a commercial species whose population has plummeted for three straight years , from an estimated biomass of 300 # 000 tons to 17 # 000 tons . Biologists believe the fish will remain at low levels for at least two more seasons . &quot; Herring populations are being depressed by a marine virus or bacterium -- one they normally carry with no ill effect , &quot; said Ted Cooney , a University of Alaska marine biologist . &quot; But the organism is triggered by stress , such_as temperature or lack of food -- and the oil spill was certainly one of the biggest stress factors around. &quot; This year , a trustee council established to administer Exxon ' s court-ordered $ 1-billion restitution fund began a five-year , $ 25-million ecosystem assessment of the sound , concentrating first on salmon and herring . &quot; Too_bad it didn ' t start five years ago , &quot; said Cooney . &quot; Alaskan science has come_away with a bad name because we spent huge amounts of dollars , but no results were made public . And if there were another spill tomorrow , I doubt if it would be any different. &quot; Can science find a better way to clean_up its environmental act ? Administrators at the U.S. Interior_Department hope so . On Oct . 27 , the department will reveal an elaborate computer model that will calculate damages from a given spill by analyzing a vast database drawn from hundreds of thousands of existing research studies . &quot; This is unique -- trying to predict injury and damage . For the first time , we have tied biology and economics with the fate of chemicals in water , &quot; said Deborah French , a biological oceanographer who is part of a team at Applied Science Associates of Narragansett , R.I. , which has labored for five years to compile the ambitious program . In a_few months , after a required review period that probably will produce some changes in the program , it will become an official government method of calculating damages from future spills . But spillers will have the option of asking_for a real-time assessment -- and paying government_agencies for costly on-site research . &quot; Most spills we ' ve test-run so far calculate damages in hundreds of thousands , not millions , of dollars , &quot; said French . One of the model ' s most sensitive measurements estimates loss of aesthetic values . &quot; Essentially , we try to answer the question , ' How much is a duck worth ? ' &quot; said David Rosenberger , of Interior ' s Office of Environmental Affairs . &quot; So we collect data on shore facilities , on what an average tourist spends to visit a site , either to hunt or fish , or just enjoy aesthetic value . &quot; This model represents the best available science , done_in a nonpolitical time , &quot; said Rosenberger . &quot; Politically , I think , there ' s no chance this program would be used in an Exxon Valdez-size spill . But in smaller spills , we hope we don ' t have to go_to court every time. &quot; To Doug Helton , head of NOAA ' s damage-assessment and response team in Silver Spring , Md. , the furor over oil is environmentally counterproductive . He sees a paradox : &quot; The amount of gasoline and diesel_fuel used in the Exxon Valdez cleanup exceeded the volume of the spill . And , in many ways , the cleanup created longer-term damage than the oil . &quot; But the sad fact is that it ' s easier to file a lawsuit than to do scientific_research . And when the two camps go_to_war , the public loses. &quot;</TEXT>
