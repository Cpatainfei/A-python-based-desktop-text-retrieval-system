   <HEADLINE> RADIALS GO RADICAL IN THEIR 2ND LIFE ; ENVIRONMENT : ONE TIRE IS TOSSED EACH YEAR FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY , MORE THAN 250 MILLION NATIONWIDE . BY THE END OF THE CENTURY , THEY ALL MAY BE PUT TO USE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This country throws_out enough tires each year to more_than girdle the globe . that ' s if they were set side_by_side upright . End to end , lying_down , they ' d be four deep around the Equator . By the end of the century , they all may be put to use , the tire industry says . The Environmental Protection Agency agrees . But there ' s an if . While states try to clear_away anywhere from 1.5 billion to 3 billion tires already piled on roadsides , dumps and vacant_lots , about 175 million a year are added_to the heaps . The EPA estimates that one tire is tossed each year for every man , woman and child in the country , more_than 250 million nationwide . There are markets for 75 million to 80 million . The rest are piled_up , shredded and stockpiled , or -- where it ' s allowed -- put into landfills . Most states no longer let landfills take whole tires , because they can capture gas and squeeze up through the other garbage , even breaking_through the heavy layer of clay used to cap the landfill . A few states ban tires entirely . The rest require them to be cut or shredded . That saves space , since tires are large pockets of air encased in rubber . It also keeps water from pooling in the tires and creating a breeding place for mosquitoes , algae , germs and other undesirables . Uses for recycled tires are as varied as imagination . Strips of rubber are cut_into shoe soles or welded into mats for erosion control or temporary roads . Bales of compressed tires support a golf_course and create its drainage_system . Crumbled rubber becomes part of hockey_pucks , roads , horse_racing tracks , NCAA tracks . Most go_up in smoke , creating power for cement plants , paper factories and homes . Anyone who ' s ever been downwind of burning rubber will doubt the pollution claim . &quot; If you ' re talking_about a tire fire , there are an awful lot of pollutants that get released , &quot; said Hope Pillsbury of the recycling section in the EPA ' s office of solid waste in Washington . &quot; But high-temperature incineration is a different story . &quot; Tires burn in the same ballpark as coal . If you ' ve got high-sulfur coal , it probably burns dirtier than tires . Plus you ' ve got a lot of pollution-control equipment. &quot; The prediction that all scrap tires could be recycled by the end of 1998 comes from John Serumgard , chairman of the Scrap Tire Management Council and vice_president of its parent organization , the Rubber Manufacturing Assn . But his equation depends_on the federal law requiring states to use rubber mixed with asphalt on their roads . If the law is enforced , up_to 70 million tires a year could go_into highways . But there ' s no enforcement money in this year ' s budget , and no telling when there will be . Among other things , not everyone agrees that the rubber-asphalt mix is a good thing . Asphalt can be recycled . Rubber-asphalt , or RUMAC , cannot . Still , Serumgard said , rubber recycling has come an incredible way in less than a decade , especially in the last few years . &quot; In 1985 , the EPA estimated that less than 6 % of all scrap tires were used in any positive way , &quot; he said . &quot; By 1990 , it was 10.7 % . &quot; Now , about one-third of all tires are recycled . &quot; We would estimate that probably 5 million are going_into ground-rubber applications , probably another 5 million are going_into civil-engineering applications , &quot; Serumgard said . &quot; The balance , about 70 million , are going_into fuel uses. &quot; The growth of the industry can be tracked in the pages of Scrap Tire News , which Mary Sikora and her family first published eight years ago . The inaugural issue was four pages . It now runs 20 pages a month . January ' s special issue comparing the laws of all 50 states took 36 pages . The Scrap Tire Users Directory , also published by the Sikoras , has grown from 1 # 200 listings to 2 # 000 over three editions . Which is not to say that tire recycling is a fail-safe business . Kenny Stewart added $ 175 # 000 worth of shredders and conveyor_belts to his Riverside Recycling plant after Louisiana decreed that every tire sale must include a $ 2 fee to pay_for clearing away old tires . He sold the business 15 months later . &quot; We couldn ' t compete with someone who is working_out of the back of a pickup_truck and throwing them out into a back alley or abandoned lot , &quot; Stewart said . About six months later , the woman who bought Stewart ' s tire equipment called to tell him she was selling_out too . Louisiana has recycling rules but just proposed a new set_in February because the current ones , approved in 1992 , don ' t work . When new tires are sold , the seller takes_in an extra $ 2 . Half goes_to the state_Department of Environmental Quality to enforce the law . The other half is supposed to cover the cost of proper disposal . Tire dealers take the lowest bid -- often under $ 1 -- and the lowest bidder sometimes dumps tires , said Michael Vince , program manager for recycling in the DEQ ' s solid waste division . Many other states have similar laws , but none has been able to stop &quot; tire jockeys &quot; from dumping tires on vacant_lots or roadsides . &quot; As far as I know , in the state of Connecticut , we are the only ones with a permit , yet there are beaucoup tire jockeys in Connecticut , &quot; said Bruce Hayn , general_manager at Oxford Tire Supply in Plainfield . His company collects 100 # 000 tons of tires a year -- about 13.75 million -- from Connecticut and 11 surrounding states . About 20 % are in good_enough shape to sell for reuse or re-treading . The remaining 11 million are fuel for Oxford ' s sister company , Exeter Energy Co . &quot; that ' s 300 tons a day -- approximately 30 # 000 tires a day , seven days a week , &quot; Hayn said . &quot; It works_out to approximately enough electricity for 30 # 000 homes , or about one tire per day per home. &quot; Oxford Tire is paid about $ 1 for every car_tire it collects , although large tires from front-end loaders and other heavy equipment fetch as much as $ 200 . Exeter ' s plant produces 30 megawatts a day . It uses about 1.5 megawatts itself , and sells the rest to Northeast Utilities for 6 to 8 cents a kilowatt . &quot; The facility in Connecticut can utilize 10 million tires a year , &quot; Serumgard said . &quot; You say 10 million isn ' t much compared to 250 million scrap tires . Let me tell you , 10 million is an awful lot of tires if you have to bring them to one particular spot. &quot;</TEXT>
