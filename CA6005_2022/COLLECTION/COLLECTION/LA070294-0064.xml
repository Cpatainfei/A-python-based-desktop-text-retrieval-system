   <HEADLINE> U.S. SCRAMBLES TO ACCOMMODATE HAITI REFUGEES ; CARIBBEAN : UP TO 1 # 000 PEOPLE A DAY ARE ARRIVING_AT TEMPORARY PROCESSING CENTERS IN JAMAICA AND CUBA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Haitian teacher Prophet Guerrier , his pregnant wife , Yolette , and their five children , Friday had a happy ending . After 24 hours aboard a white U.S. Navy hospital_ship where he had recounted the harrowing murder of his parents and years of living in fear in his native_land , U.S. immigration authorities said &quot; yes. &quot; The Guerriers are coming_to America . &quot; We are happy because we knew we could not go_back to Haiti , &quot; said Guerrier , 37 , as he and his family sat in a Jamaican shuttle_bus whose side was painted with the words : &quot; Smile With Pleasure Tours. &quot; The children were wide-eyed and silent as the bus took them from the ship to a military transport plane bound for the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Their parents , a week after leaving Petite Goave in a small_boat , looked stunned with fatigue and good_fortune . In what is fast becoming one of the largest , most complex emergency immigration operations in U.S. history , the tide of refugees continued to build Friday . Since June 15 , the U.S. Coast Guard has picked_up more_than 7 # 000 Haitians fleeing a country in the grip of economic sanctions designed to drive its military rulers from power . It is a migration fueled by oppression , poverty -- and much-improving odds of winning asylum in the United States . As_many as 1 # 000 Haitians a day are making the trip to a processing center , either here aboard the hospital_ship in Kingston Harbor or a rapidly expanding tent city at Guantanamo . So far , about 30 of every 100 Haitians interviewed have been judged to have a well-founded fear of persecution , a huge increase over the five in 100 who had been granted asylum before last month . After a complete physical exam at Guantanamo , where they will be tested for tuberculosis and AIDS , all those granted asylum will be permitted to enter the United States . The large_numbers of immigrants sent military officials at Guantanamo scrambling to accommodate them . Working around the clock to build shelters , they warned that they could not absorb the current flow of migrants for long . By noon Friday , 1 # 956 Haitians had arrived , including 1 # 081 on Thursday alone , and there is space for only 12 # 500 . Base officials are providing refugees with meals and clothing while constructing tent villages . They are determined not to repeat the mistakes of 1992 , when Haitians flooded the base , exceeded the capacity of facilities built for them and threatened to riot . &quot; If there was any lesson learned , it ' s that you ' ve got_to show these people that there ' s some kind of flow-through , &quot; said Col . Michael Pearson , a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Army who heads the joint operation at the base . But Pearson said he does not expect to begin processing the migrants , who must be interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization Service adjudicators , until next week . Refugees who pass INS screening must wait at the base until the State_Department finds a U.S. family or group to sponsor them . Pearson repeatedly underscored the need to process refugees before they fill the facility to overflowing . &quot; They ' ve got_to move_on , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve got_to assume the flow_out of Haiti is going_to remain fairly constant. &quot; And if the stories the migrants are telling are any indication , he is correct . A 29-year-old man wearing a gray Honolulu surfing T-shirt said that Haitian military_officers jailed and beat him after he protested the coup that ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Army death squads are still seeking him , he said , and he left when President Clinton announced that the United States would begin processing migrants . He would not give his name , saying that he feared retribution from the military . Approved for refugee status , he said that he hopes to find a job in Florida . &quot; Anything I find will be better than Haiti , &quot; he said . Another man , wearing a faded light blue T-shirt and sandals , said that soldiers shot at him as he ran to a boat leaving Haiti . He had arranged to rendezvous with the boat elsewhere in case of trouble , he said , and managed to escape . Others were not so lucky . &quot; Thirty people were shot down trying to get_on the boat , &quot; said the man , who gave his first_name as St . Hubert . He spent three days on a 17-foot vessel with 62 other people before a Coast Guard cutter intercepted them , he said . Many of the refugees collected by Coast Guard cutters are now being taken directly to Guantanamo , but earlier refugees were taken_to Jamaica . Aboard the hospital_ship , Haitians are put into an assembly_line that processes asylum claims around the clock . New arrivals are given surgical masks in case they have tuberculosis , a computer chip identification bracelet and a promise that their stories will be heard . &quot; These are people who need to be treated delicately and given a careful interview , &quot; said Bo Cooper , an INS attorney . &quot; There is no quota on the number granted asylum . We know conditions in Haiti are bad , but each case is different. &quot; The majority of Haitians are still shuttled to Port-au-Prince , the Haitian_capital , either because they are deemed to be lying or because they cannot prove that they would be in fear of persecution back home . With a multi-agency staff of 1 # 100 , the floating processing center here can handle several hundred migrants a day . But Friday almost 1 # 000 Haitians were aboard and many would wait 24 hours before sitting for their first interview . Times special correspondent Clary reported from Kingston , and Times staff writer Leeds from Guantanamo .</TEXT>
