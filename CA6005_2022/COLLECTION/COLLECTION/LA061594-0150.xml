   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : WORLD CUP IS HERE -- BUT DO WE CARE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My car is parked just outside Gate 1 at Anaheim Stadium , long after sundown , long after the final out , and it won ' t start . A dead battery at an Angels ' game . Symbolism hangs heavy in the air . I am_on the phone with a tow-truck dispatcher , providing the requisite information . Name , make of vehicle , location of vehicle . &quot; Anaheim Stadium ? &quot; the dispatcher says . &quot; Was there a game today ? &quot; &quot; Yeah , &quot; I tell him . &quot; The Angels beat the Brewers. &quot; Silence on the other end . Dispatcher apparently is stunned . &quot; You know , &quot; he finally replies , &quot; I ' m really detached from sports right now . All I ' m waiting for is the World Cup. &quot; Soon , I am standing at a pay phone in a pitch_black , otherwise vacant parking_lot , discussing the prospects of the United States advancing out of Group_A , the crazy antics of Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos and the horrible goal Rene Higuita allowed against Cameroon in the second round of the 1990 World Cup . The dispatcher says he is glad Colombia has replaced Higuita with a different goalkeeper for this World Cup . He says he likes Colombia ' s chances much better now . He says a tow truck will be there within 45 minutes . * &quot; Do you have any soccer magazines ? &quot; I ask the vendor at the Westwood sidewalk newsstand . &quot; Are you Americans ? &quot; the vendor asks . Vendor apparently is stunned . Yes , I tell him . We are American journalists , assigned to cover the World Cup , and we have to become lifelong experts in the next six days , so we ' d better start reading now . &quot; I am going_to the June 19 game , &quot; the vendor says enthusiastically . &quot; Sweden-Cameroon . A tough game for us . Cameroon is all offense . They don ' t care about anything else , just offense. &quot; Our vendor ' s name is Karl , he ' s from Sweden and he ' s a big fan of Tommy Svensson , the new Swedish coach who is going_to turn the thing around . &quot; Write this down , &quot; Karl says . &quot; Sweden 2 , Brazil 1 . That is the score . We will have trouble with Cameroon , but we will beat Brazil. &quot; He finishes ringing_up our order . &quot; Sweden beats Brazil . You see if I am right. &quot; * Scenes from a World Cup host who couldn ' t care less ? We are not worthy , that ' s what the rest of the soccer-playing world tells us . We are not interested , that ' s what a Harris Poll tells us . Seventy-one percent of Americans don ' t know the World Cup is being held_in the United States . Fifty-six percent have no interest in watching any of the games on television . Sixty-two percent don ' t even know the World Cup is a soccer tournament . Yet the games are selling_out , everywhere except Dallas , and that ' s a problem World Cup officials could solve in three seconds if they changed the wording on their advertising from &quot; Group_B and C Round-Robin Competition &quot; to &quot; 1994 Cowboy Placekicker Tryouts. &quot; Foreigners can ' t be buying all_the tickets . Who ' s snapping_up the others ? The so-called American soccer underground -- you know , the unshaven , vertical-stripe-shirted loners you spot from time to time in the corner of an international bookstore , breathing heavily over the latest copy of &quot; World Soccer &quot; ? This seems unlikely , in that scalpers are asking $ 1 # 100 for World Cup tickets and many members of the American soccer underground have jobs as tow-truck service dispatchers . That leaves the curiosity seekers , the gawkers , the I ' ll-try-anything-once types with money to burn and a burning desire to brag to the guys at_work , &quot; I actually saw a goal . No kidding . Look , I even took photos. &quot; To get them to try it twice -- that ' s the real goal of this World Cup . And for that to happen , this World Cup has to sweep aside two hoary and petrified perceptions mainstream America has about soccer . 1 . There ' s not enough scoring . 2 . We ' re no good at it . No . 1 is going_to be a bear , because the rest of the world loves soccer just the way it is . Poetry is written after 0-0 ties while a 5-4 final is dismissed as an act of shoddy rank amateurism and both goalkeepers had better be_on the first rail out of town in the morning if they know what ' s best for them . Some minor tinkering has been approved for World Cup ' 94 -- the ball has a slicker surface , supposedly to cut_down on air drag , and shoe toes have been flanged to provide a steadier shot -- but when the United States also proposed larger nets and moving the games inside hockey rinks , FIFA decided to draw_the_line . As for No . 2 , our only hope is that the scores remain 0-0 , 1-0 and 1-1 . If you spot the United States playing any 5-2 games in the first round , you can pretty much bet_on no United States games in the second round . Bora Milutinovic ' s team has one prayer in its group -- flood the defensive zone , keep the score as low as possible and hope for a fluke at the other end . Against Colombia , this is highly unlikely . Colombia , with its Valderrama-to-Asprilla goal production_line , is expected to grind the United States into thin lines of fine white powder . Romania , too , is supposed to be too rich for our blood , though the Romanians are noted for their waning attention_span against lesser opponents . That leaves Switzerland , Saturday ' s Cup-opening opponent for the United States . Consensus holds that since this is the game the Americans have_the_best chance of winning , this is the game the Americans must win . Tie it and the scramble is_on . Lose it and the home crowd goes_back to its morning box scores . Win it , however , and it will be Miracle On Ice Revisited . The shot heard round the world ? Once ESPN and CNN get their hands on it , the winning goal will be the shot seen and seen and seen around the world and back . So there won ' t be too_much pressure on Bora and his boys as they step inside the Pontiac Silverdome on Saturday . Just the future of soccer as a legitimate sport in the United States , riding_on every move they make . One way or another , we ' ll know in a hurry .</TEXT>
