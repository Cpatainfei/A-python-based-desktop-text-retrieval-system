   <HEADLINE> DECISION IN MEXICO ; WINNER INHERITS THORNY COLOSIO CASE ; PROBE : FOR MANY , THE MUDDLED INVESTIGATION OF THE MARCH ASSASSINATION SYMBOLIZES PROFOUND DOUBTS ABOUT RULE OF LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Ernesto Zedillo claims victory in Mexico ' s presidential election , he moves toward a challenge that could prove the ultimate test of his promises for change : the Colosio case . Although Mexico ' s next president will enter a dramatically altered political landscape bristling with difficult tasks , perhaps none is as politically and personally delicate as the unresolved assassination of ruling party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . Colosio ' s killing at a Tijuana campaign rally in March catapulted Zedillo , the slain candidate ' s campaign manager , from technocratic obscurity to the pinnacle of power . With the election race in_full_swing in July , angry Mexicans rejected the government ' s conclusion that the alleged killer , Mario Aburto Martinez , acted alone . A new special prosecutor was appointed to probe allegations of a conspiracy , notably the increasing accusations of a plot involving hard-line leaders of Zedillo ' s Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) and powerful drug cartels . Zedillo inherits both a muddled investigation and a weary citizenry left cynical by generalized lawlessness and a string of unsolved murders linked to drug corruption . For many Mexicans -- according to Mexican officials , journalists , human_rights activists and other analysts -- the Colosio case has come_to symbolize profound doubts about the rule_of_law . &quot; The question is whether the Mexican judiciary system works , &quot; said Jorge Mancillas , a UCLA professor and adviser to the alleged gunman ' s family , which accuses the government of involvement in a plot . &quot; The Colosio case is a litmus test of whether any of the major political_parties understand the issue or just inherit a system of government based on patronage and corruption. &quot; Many conspiracy theorists share Mancillas ' fear that the crime will simply fade into memory and myth , becoming Mexico ' s version of the assassination of President John F . Kennedy . &quot; Zedillo isn ' t going_to do anything , &quot; scoffed a young official in Baja California , a state run_by the opposition National Action Party . &quot; He has too many debts and connections . The main suspects are the ' dinosaurs ' ( old-guard politicians ) , who are very powerful in his own party. &quot; But there is another school of thought : that either Zedillo or lame-duck President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who will rule until December , could make the case top priority in a bold , risky attempt to demonstrate true reform . Recalling how Salinas sought to legitimize his questionable victory in 1988 with attacks on high-level corruption , one analyst said Zedillo would benefit from an aggressive investigation of the Colosio case . &quot; Even if the intellectual authors turn_out to be people close to the system , this could become a strategy to purge the PRI and symbolize a new era , &quot; said Tonatiuh Lopez Guillen , a political_scientist at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana . The assassination was not a prominent theme in Zedillo ' s campaign . But he declared on several occasions that he and his party wanted justice done . Regardless , the law_enforcement and political obstacles remain formidable . Critics say that former special prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia came_up with thin evidence , neglected potential leads and lurched from a conspiracy theory -- he filed charges against five alleged plotters -- back to the lone gunman scenario . The result : confusion and suspicion among the public . Moreover , the trail has grown cold after five months . It seems more difficult than ever to establish whether Aburto ' s mysterious conduct and self-proclaimed political connections were indicative_of a plot or of a deluded lone assassin . &quot; Resolving the case necessitates reconstructing the chain of events , &quot; said Gerardo Albarran de Alba , a political reporter for Proceso , a respected national weekly . &quot; That will be difficult . . . . Even if the opposition won , it would be difficult to break the blockage of information within the police apparatus , to totally renovate the judicial system. &quot; The main development recently has been the emergence of a potential new witness , Eduardo Valle Espinosa , a former top aide in the attorney_general ' s office who headed an elite unit investigating powerful drug lords . A colorful , tough-talking former student leader and journalist known as &quot; The Owl , &quot; Valle quit his post in May and denounced the corruption that he says has turned Mexico into a &quot; narco-democracy. &quot; More recently , Valle has offered to testify about his suspicions that the assassination was related to infiltration of the Colosio campaign by drug-trafficking interests ; he has also implicated two former police commanders who worked as Colosio aides , and named top government officials with alleged drug ties as well . Valle told journalists that he tried to warn Colosio of the dangers shortly before the candidate ' s death . Valle has moved to Washington for his safety . Investigators are preparing to take his testimony at an as-yet undesignated Mexican consulate in the United States , spokesman Miguel Angel Sanchez de Armas said Monday . Since the appointment in July of special prosecutor Olga Islas de Gonzalez Mariscal , authorities have taken 64 statements from previous witnesses and new ones , he said . &quot; Nothing has emerged that has enough relevance to change the direction of the initial investigation , &quot; Sanchez said . Although Valle ' s allegations remain uncorroborated , his statements , coming from a knowledgeable former law_enforcement official , add credibility to assertions that Colosio fell victim to the fearsome mix of drugs and politics ; and a high-ranking official of the Baja state_government said in an interview that , before the assassination , he learned that men with purported criminal connections were part of the Colosio campaign . &quot; I was very surprised to see the kind of people who were around Colosio , &quot; said the Baja official , who suspects a conspiracy involving some of the most powerful politicians in Mexico . But pursuing the &quot; narco-politics &quot; thesis would pose considerable danger if the case remains open when Zedillo takes_office . It could bring him into conflict with PRI &quot; dinosaurs , &quot; who were instrumental in his apparent victory . Experts question whether the president would have the strength or desire for this clash amid the multiple challenges of resolving the conflict with Indian rebels in Chiapas , negotiating with powerful opposition parties and putting_together a viable government . Similarly , although Salinas ' image would benefit from an investigative bombshell before he steps_down , he may_not have the power to strike such a blow . &quot; It ' s hard to foresee serious progress coming from an initiative led by the present government before Dec . 1 , &quot; when it goes_out of power , Mancillas said . So Zedillo could end_up ordering investigators to determine conclusively whether or not Aburto acted alone , then trying to persuade the Mexican people of the correctness of the outcome . At stake would be the credibility of the justice system as well as who killed Colosio . &quot; Certainly , Zedillo like no one else will feel pressure to resolve the case with the truth , &quot; said Albarran of Proceso . He added that , if the narco-politics thesis is valid , &quot; Zedillo is doubly obligated -- because the next president will have to fight drug trafficking to_the_point that is politically and humanly possible in_order to heal the democratic life of this country. &quot;</TEXT>
