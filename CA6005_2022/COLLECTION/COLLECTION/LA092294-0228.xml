   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; U.S. AND JAPAN AGREE TO OPEN NEW TRADE TALKS ; COMMERCE : NEGOTIATORS RUSH TO MEET SEPT . 30 DEADLINE . NEITHER SIDE RELISHES SANCTIONS , OR CAPITULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senior U.S. and Japanese negotiators opened trade talks Wednesday , racing to strike a deal ahead of a month ' s-end sanctions showdown . Arriving for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said he was optimistic that an agreement would be reached before the Sept . 30 deadline . &quot; I will make every effort to reach agreement in Japan-U.S. trade talks . I have an impression that the U.S. is also willing to reach agreement , &quot; Kono said . Kono , also expected to meet with President Clinton , added : &quot; I cannot set a time_limit at this moment but I do hope we are going_to make a deal as soon as possible. &quot; Tokyo faces a stark ultimatum : open your markets or risk sanctions on everything from car parts to flat glass . And while neither side fancies a trade war , nor can either stomach the thought of capitulating in this , the home stretch . Asked what sanctions course he might pursue , Kantor replied , &quot; We have made no decision on any of that . We are waiting to see what Minister Kono has to say , and we will have our discussions ( Wednesday ) and in the next number of days. &quot; Kantor said he did not know if the Japanese were bringing new proposals . Asked if he had anything new_to offer Tokyo , Kantor replied , &quot; Our position is quite clear. &quot; In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee , Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said that history suggested that the talks would go_down to the wire . &quot; I can ' t say there has been great progress thus far ; there has some been some , &quot; he told the committee . Kono ' s deputy , Sadayuki Hayashi , kicked_off the day ' s meeting with Kantor ' s top Japan aide , Charlene Barshefsky , while Brown was expected to be in close telephone contact with his Japanese counterpart , Ryutaro Hashimoto . In short : the heat is finally on . The negotiators last met early this month on the site of international trade talks in Los Angeles . While those talks helped improve the often sour tone of transpacific economic relations , administration officials said they forged little concrete progress . At issue : how best to cut Japan ' s ballooning trade surplus and open its markets to more foreign goods . Despite months of fitful negotiations and plenty of promises to make &quot; best efforts , &quot; the two-way trade picture remains bleak . On Tuesday , the Commerce_Department reported a staggering 21.6 % jump in July ' s U.S. trade_deficit , with Japan accounting_for half the shortfall at $ 5.67 billion . The news -- much worse than expected -- was gobbled_up in financial markets , which are increasingly fearful of a costly confrontation between the world ' s biggest economies . &quot; This is going_to go_down to the wire , &quot; said economist Christopher Rupkey at Mitsubishi Bank . &quot; The two parties are trying to negotiate ( a trade truce ) and they won ' t reveal their hands until the final minute. &quot; On Tuesday , Clinton met a clutch of top advisers to mull trade strikes should the last-ditch negotiations fail to broker a deal by Sept . 30 , Administration sources said . The sources said &quot; all options &quot; were under review as the two sides make one last stab at averting a sanctions showdown . Sanctions proposals are running_on two tracks . First , Washington is pushing Tokyo to play fair when it awards government contracts_in telecommunications and medical technology . Without a breakthrough , it will face retaliatory sanctions under so-called Title VII . Second , Tokyo could face accusations of discrimination on a range of fronts as part of the Super 301 law , which would trigger months of negotiations under the threat of sanctions .</TEXT>
