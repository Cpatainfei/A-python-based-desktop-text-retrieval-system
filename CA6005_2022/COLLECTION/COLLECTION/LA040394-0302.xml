   <HEADLINE> WHEELS TURNING AT MOBILE_HOME PARKS IN O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among the residents of Sierra Mobile_Homes Estates , Gerie Kirkpatrick is known as the Rose Lady . In front of the blue-and-white home that Kirkpatrick and her husband bought_in 1982 , she cultivates 18 rose bushes that bloom in yellow , pink and white . Scissors hang from a small wooden sign hand-painted with the words , &quot; Help yourself to a rose. &quot; Her neighbors at the 230-home park often do -- and no one steals the scissors . Kirkpatrick , now a widow and retired , owns her Huntington Beach mobile_home , but she doesn ' t own the rose garden . And because of escalating rental rates for spaces in the park , she says , keeping the home itself is becoming difficult . &quot; We thought we did such a smart thing when we moved_in here , thinking it was a good , affordable place to retire , &quot; Kirkpatrick said . &quot; Then we were hit with rent increases . People are walking away from their trailers , and they are going_back to the banks. &quot; The rent on Kirkpatrick ' s space in Sierra Mobile_Homes Estates has climbed to $ 488 a month from $ 220 six years ago , she said . That is in addition to her monthly payment of $ 429 on her home . Squeezed_by such increases , a growing number of California ' s mobile_home dwellers , estimated to total more_than 1 million , say they are being forced_out . Facing that prospect , many are taking_advantage of state laws that encourage them to band_together and buy the property on which their homes sit . Besides gaining control of rental rates , residents who own their parks can set policies and regulations , pool their money to improve common areas and build equity that they can cash_in if they decide to sell their mobile_homes . Local_governments are getting involved , too , especially in urban_areas like Orange and Los Angeles counties , to preserve mobile_home parks as affordable housing for elderly people such_as Kirkpatrick who live_on fixed incomes and for young , lower-income families . California ' s mobile_home population has changed dramatically in the past 30 years . During the 1960s , most park residents were elderly people who bought homes for as little as $ 15 # 000 , often paying_cash for them after retiring and selling conventional houses . During the real_estate boom of the 1980s , working families priced out of the housing market began moving_into the parks . Driven by consumer demand , mobile_home prices soared . In the economic downturn and housing_industry slump that followed , however , many of those working people lost their jobs . At the same time , the value of their mobile_homes sank because of depreciation and the real_estate decline . Homes for which families had paid between $ 50 # 000 and $ 80 # 000 were bringing only $ 20 # 000 to $ 30 # 000 as resales , according to the Manufactured Housing Educational Trust , a trade group based in Orange County . At the same time , rent on spaces in parks began increasing . Sites that rented for $ 250 a month in the mid-1980s now range as high as $ 1 # 000 in coastal areas and average about $ 500 , according to the trade group . As early as 1986 , the state launched a program that made low-interest loans available to park residents . Of the estimated 4 # 000 mobile_home parks in California , only about 120 so far have converted to resident-owned parks -- knows as ROPs . But interest is increasing sharply , said John Tennyson , chief consultant with the state Senate Select Committee on Mobile_Homes . &quot; Rents are going_to continue to go_up , &quot; said Tennyson , whose committee has published a pamphlet titled Guide to Mobilehome Park Purchases by Residents . &quot; that ' s the biggest issue driving the trend toward park ownership. &quot; This month , an intergovernmental agency created by the California State Assn . of Counties and the League of California Cities will mail_out brochures for a new program called &quot; MuniHome. &quot; Under the program , the agency , which has sold various types of bonds since the 1980s , will offer tax-exempt revenue_bonds for cities , counties or nonprofit groups such_as mobile_home residents who can then use the proceeds to buy the parks . New York investment bank Lazard Freres &amp; Co . has been chosen to sell the bonds , which will be paid_off with park operating revenue . &quot; We want to help cities and counties who are interested in preserving existing low-income housing stock , &quot; said Dan Harrison , assistant director with the cities league in Sacramento . &quot; It ' s a tough decision for a city or county to acquire a mobile_home park . We ' re not saying they should . But if they make that decision , we want to help them do_it well. &quot; Beyond seeking to ensure affordable housing , local_governments are sometimes getting_into the mobile_home park market after being drawn into disputes between park owners and tenants . In the Ventura County , which has 23 # 136 mobile_home residents , the Santa Paula City_Council was besieged two years ago by angry tenants who alleged rent gouging by park owners . City voters subsequently passed a measure that tightened rent-control laws already in_effect . But the owner of one mobile_home park then sued the city , alleging that the new regulations interfered with his ability to make a profit . James Taylor , owner of the Santa Paula West Mobilehome Park , withdrew his lawsuit after agreeing to sell the property to the residents for $ 9.2 million . The city has agreed to supply housing redevelopment bond money , but the purchase has not been finalized because park residents say the price is too high . Interest by either a city or a residents ' group in buying a park does not guarantee a done deal . In some cases , park owners are simply not interested in selling . Gene Pica , an owner of Sierra Mobile_Home Estates where Kirkpatrick lives , said the Huntington Beach property is profitable , and &quot; our rents are right where they should be . We ' re just a mile and a half from the ocean. &quot; &quot; If we do sell , we ' ll give them first choice , &quot; Pica said of the park ' s residents , who have formed a nonprofit group , the Sierra Residents Corp . State law , in fact , requires park owners to notify residents first before putting the property up for_sale . But for now , Pica said , &quot; we ' re just not selling. &quot; Other park owners complain that tenant groups who want to buy them out are either poorly organized or cannot obtain financing . &quot; The ideal buyer is the tenant , &quot; said Richard Hall , a Costa Mesa businessman who is a part-owner of Orange County ' s largest mobile_home park : the 29-acre Treasure Island Mobile_Home Park on the oceanfront at Laguna Beach . &quot; But they don ' t have their act together. &quot; Other park owners say they feel pressured to sell once residents announce their interest in buying . &quot; I think if an owner wants to sell to the residents , that ' s fine , but they shouldn ' t be forced to , &quot; said Norman McAdoo , a partner with Busch , Carr , McAdoo in Garden Grove , which owns five mobile_home parks in Orange County . &quot; Everyone wants to live_in Orange County -- it ' s California ' s paradise . ( Park ) residents are complaining about rents , but nowhere else in Orange County could you get a decent place to live for those prices. &quot; Such different viewpoints can be an obstacle when residents sit_down to negotiate a purchase , said Gerald Gibbs , a lawyer with Gibbs , Dunham &amp; Gibbs . The firm , based in San Clemente , specializes in resident-owned parks . &quot; In many parks , the residents are pitted against the owners over issues like rent and rent control , &quot; he said . The owners &quot; resent the fact that these homeowners have banded_together and screamed and yelled and got the city to go_along with them in terms of financing. &quot; Despite the obstacles , at least two Orange County cities , Garden Grove and La Habra , have already bought mobile_home parks with money raised by issuing a total of $ 35 million in tax-exempt bonds . In Los Angeles County , which has nearly 105 # 000 mobile_home dwellers , the city of Lancaster has used redevelopment funds to purchase two parks and is negotiating to buy several more of the 33 parks within the city_limits . Several deals have been completed in recent months , too , by nonprofit residents ' groups . In December , for example , the 268 dwellers in the Bayside Village Mobile_Home Park in Newport Beach purchased a 279-slip marina and the 56 acres under their homes from the Irvine Co . for $ 12 million . Other park purchases are being negotiated . In January , mobile_home owners in Lake Forest asked that city to co-sign a $ 6-million loan so they can buy the lease on Kimberly Gardens Mobile_Home Park , where 1 # 300 people live . Industry consultants and even park owners foresee an increasing number of the state ' s mobile_home communities being run as nonprofit entities . &quot; The whole status of mobile_home parks in California is going_to change in the next decade , with most of them becoming owned by tenants and cities , &quot; said Laguna Beach park owner Hall . &quot; Thirty years ago it was a good idea to buy your mobile_home and set it up_on someone else ' s land . that ' s not true today. &quot; Indeed , though the name &quot; mobile_home &quot; suggests otherwise , owners cannot simply move to a new park where rents are lower , lawyer Gibbs said . &quot; The industry has changed since 1955 -- it ' s not Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz hooking_up their trailer to their car , &quot; he said . &quot; These things don ' t move today . Some have stucco walls and tile roofs. &quot; That is all_the more incentive for park dwellers to become landowners . Homeowner Kirkpatrick , who paid $ 42 # 000 for her home , says she has spent at least $ 15 # 000 on improvements . She estimates that she could sell her home , though , for no more_than $ 25 # 000 , partly because the value of mobile_homes has depreciated rapidly in the Southern California real_estate downturn . David Hennessy , president of the Golden State Mobile Homeowners League in Garden Grove , said Orange County , which has more_than 53 # 000 mobile_home residents , is especially ripe for purchase by park dwellers . The reasons are high housing costs in_general and a lack of any form of rent control , said Hennessy , whose nonprofit group represents 100 # 000 mobile_home owners in California . Still , park owners ' groups question the fairness of state and local backing for purchase of parks by residents . &quot; Should a city make a gift of public funds to help a_couple_of hundred people buy property ? &quot; asked Vickie M . Talley , executive_director of the Orange County Manufactured Housing Educational Trust , a mobile_home park owners association . &quot; Just like any other homeowner , they should have to come_up with the down_payment and make the payments. &quot; Consultant Tennyson of the state Senate Select Committee on Mobile_Homes argues that park residents , though , are in a special situation . Mobile_homes are the only affordable housing available to many lower-income people , he said , and thus should be protected . &quot; Mobile_homes are something the state should be involved in , &quot; he said . &quot; Many of these people are seniors on fixed income . If they are economically forced_out of their homes , they will end_up on the streets , and the taxpayers will eventually be supporting them. &quot; Among mobile_home residents who have succeeded in buying their parks , the consensus is that they made a wise decision . Ben Hetherington , 64 , a former Pasadena police_officer who owns a mobile_home in the Shorecliffs park in San Clemente , said he and his neighbors are delighted with their $ 12.8-million purchase , completed in September , 1992 . Each resident obtained a separate bank loan to buy his or her individual parcel_of_land , and now the 192-home park operates much like a condominium association . It is governed by a seven-member board of directors , of which Hetherington is one . &quot; You don ' t pay rent , you control your own park , and you have a say in what work is to be done , &quot; Hetherington said . &quot; You don ' t have to go_to someone else and ask_for something . We have the security to know we can stay here and control our future. &quot; Profile of Mobile_Home Parks * Number of parks in Orange County : 214 * History : The majority were built during the 1960s and ' 70s . The county ' s newest park was built 10 years ago . Most are_on leased land . * Typical space rental fee : $ 375 to $ 500 a month * Average price for a new mobile_home : $ 50 # 000 * Average resale price : Varies widely according to condition and location . Recent sales ranged from $ 8 # 500 to $ 89 # 900 , with an average of $ 37 # 700 . * Glossary : Trailer_parks offer little more_than a space to park a travel trailer . Mobile-home parks are larger communities with more space between homes and feature recreation facilities such_as pools , open spaces and sites for organized activities . HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN MOBILE_HOMES ? According to the 1990 census , 3.6 % of Orange County ' s population lived_in mobile_homes . In inland counties , the rate is much higher .
