   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; ANALYSIS ; TAYLOR NEVER LIT FLAME FOR U.S. TEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What does_it say , when the caliber of play in the Olympic hockey tournament is at an all-time low , and the competition more even , that the U.S. team has slipped from fourth place two years ago to no higher than seventh here ? That an American team has not won a medal since 1980 , its longest drought in Olympic competition ? It says that the United States , even though it is producing more skillful players than ever , still can ' t match the deep talent pools available to Russia , Sweden , Canada and Finland . And it says there ' s something lacking at the coaching level , too . From Lou Vairo , who could barely stand on skates when he misled the 1984 team to a seventh-place finish at Sarajevo , through the rude defensiveness of Dave Peterson in 1988 and 1992 to Tim Taylor , who was incapable of moderating his team ' s emotional temperament , U.S. coaches have failed at the Games . Perhaps not even the most brilliant strategist could have compensated for all_the talent lost to the NHL , and maybe the skill just isn ' t there on defense . But the shortcomings behind the bench made a difficult situation worse . Taylor is intelligent , articulate , loyal to his players and idealistic . Maybe too idealistic . When Canada ' s offense proved punchless in pre-Olympic play , Coach Tom Renney sifted through half_a_dozen players until he found a mix that produced goals and chemistry . Finland added nine new players after a 6-2 loss to the United States at the Izvestia tournament two months ago and crushed the U.S. here , where it mattered , 6-1 . Russia sifted through two teams before compiling a squad that ' s in the tournament semifinals . Aware all along that his team was young and impetuous and might react badly under Olympic pressure , Taylor still made only two late changes . The addition of forwards Ted Drury and Peter Ciavaglia was planned well in_advance , but in Drury ' s case , it didn ' t help the team ' s maturity or add the on-ice leadership . The team never improved , never peaked . To some extent , Taylor was limited by his meager resources . But he has to take responsibility for not being able to read or change his team ' s personality . The players took their emotional cues from him . And Taylor stood there , barking commands without expression , arms folded across his chest . After taking a 1-0 lead over a good Swedish team in their fourth preliminary-round game , the U.S. players should have been flying . When they went flat instead , Taylor did nothing to rekindle the fire . And his assistant , John Cunniff , also a clever strategist but as emotionless as Taylor , kept his hands in his pockets . The players lost their edge -- and the game . This team began dropping_out of medal contention in its opener , when it couldn ' t hold leads of 1-0 and 2-1 over a bumbling French team and needed a late , two-goal rally to pull_out a tie . Rallies against Slovakia and Canada continued to deplete the emotional resources of the U.S. team . &quot; I think ( France ) was the key game , &quot; Ciavaglia said . &quot; Instead of getting a big win and starting off in a confident way , it got us off balance and kept us off balance a little bit . The whole tournament , with the exception of the one game against Italy ( a 7-1 victory ) , never went the way we had diagramed it. &quot; Taylor didn ' t do enough to turn the tide of undisciplined play , although the players ' lack of self-control might have been one reason they were available to the Olympic team and not in the NHL . But the suspicion lingers that he simply didn ' t make the most of what he had , and that ' s the real pity . After a 5-3 loss to the Czech Republic on Thursday night , which means the United States can finish no better than seventh , Dave Ogrean , the executive_director of USA Hockey -- the sport ' s national governing body -- said the organization does not fault Taylor . &quot; I don ' t think there should be any second-guessing , and there certainly is no second-guessing internally , &quot; Ogrean said .</TEXT>
