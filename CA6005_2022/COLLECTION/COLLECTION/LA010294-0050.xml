   <HEADLINE> FIRST AND FOREMOST ; FOR SOPHISTICATED AND AUTHENTIC TRATTORIA COOKING , PRIMI IS SECOND_FIDDLE TO NONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Italy , I can go_back to the same restaurant or trattoria two , three , even 10 years later and expect to find the same waiter , the same cooks and the very same menu at_the_same_time of year . Here , restaurants change -- their names , their owners , their cuisines -- virtually overnight . Chefs change places as fast as in a game of musical chairs , and everything seems to be in season year round . In 1986 , when Piero Selvaggio opened a second restaurant on Pico Boulevard , this consummate Italian restaurateur had a startling idea : deconstruct the sacrosanct Italian sequence of courses and zero_in on the most interesting part , the primi , or first courses . In the early days at Primi , $ 25 bought a series of 10 little dishes orchestrated to change with the season and the whimsy of the chef . This was high-class grazing , Italo-Los Angeles style . And a meal at Primi resembled an album of vivid snapshots collected from all_of Italy . Seven years later , Primi is different . The menu has reverted to a more traditional format . Now you can order from a menu that reads antipasto , primi -- and yes , secondi or main_courses , some very substantial ones , I might add , like the lamb alla cacciatora braised with a red-wine reduction or the succulent falling-off-the-bones osso_buco served in a rough-textured sauce with soft pillows of gnocchi on the side . But it also offers a particular American flexibility in picking and choosing your way through the menu . In Italy , you might have to work_up the courage to insist on no main_course . Here , I assure you , the waiter is not going_to raise an eyebrow . that ' s because at Primi , the casual sidekick to his more formal restaurant , Valentino , Selvaggio encourages his customers to eat exactly what they want to eat . And after the thrill of Primi ' s initial premise wore_off , what they wanted more_than a parade of brilliant , small tastes was sophisticated trattoria cooking , traditional dishes &quot; revisited , &quot; along with a_few surprises from the talented young chef Enrico Glaudo thrown into the mix . If you feel_like a classic insalata caprese of tender mozzarella , fresh tomato and basil leaves followed by a bowl of the deep and seductively flavored brodetto of baby octopus -- no meat , no dessert -- no problem . Or if you want grilled chicken or shrimp on top of a Caesar_salad or some_other such concoction , the cooks may groan , but they ' ll do_it . Risotto made without butter ? that ' s for the very brave to request . ( Such an idea cuts a northern Italian chef to the quick. ) When you order pasta at Primi now , instead of four or five exotically stuffed tortellini or ravioli , you get an entire plate of hand-pleated green and white farfalle or dusky garganelli infused with squid ink , perfectly cooked and sauced . The pasta special one night , penne sauced with mascarpone , peas and shreds of prosciutto , doesn ' t sound exciting , but it was faultlessly executed and immensely satisfying . I had just about despaired of finding pasta in this country treated with such respect and simplicity . At lunchtime , it can be hard to get a table because the restaurant functions as the de_facto commissary for the 20th Century Fox studio down the road . Everyone arrives in a rush at 1 p.m. Manager Donato Poto seems to know every_other party and whether they prefer the main dining_room or the garden room . The first offers a mirrored ceiling ( beware , those of the artfully concealed thinning hair ) and a view of the cooks at_work behind a wooden sculpture the staff has dubbed &quot; osso_buco &quot; for its resemblance to a veal shank . The garden room somehow manages to be considered hip despite its resemblance to a parking_lot set with tables and partially covered with a quilted cloth roof . At lunch , every_other table seems to be splitting the straightforward Caesar_salad of torn romaine tossed_in a pungent , balanced dressing . But grilled scallops on a bed of salad drizzled with olive_oil would make more sense with darker , more assertive greens . The soup of beans , barley and corn tastes as if it was hastily assembled , the flavors barely developed . It becomes evident that few people actually order more_than one course when the waiter clears_away everything after our primi . There is a long gap before our main entrees come ; the kitchen is overwhelmed with orders . When the old-fashioned lasagna with Bolognese sauce arrives , it is gummy and overcooked , but the handmade ravioli stuffed with porcini and tossed with a lightly fragrant tomato-and-basil sauce is quite wonderful . And the thick , grilled tuna steak in a sauce flecked with tomato and hot_pepper is accompanied by chewy grains of couscous , a reference_to the Arabic influence in Sicilian cuisine . The real virtues of the restaurant ' s Italian cooking are_best appreciated at dinner , when the pace is less frenetic , the lights are dimmed and the atmosphere is relaxed and informal . Each of my evening meals has been beautifully paced and we ' ve ended_up lingering for hours . Among the best dishes on the dinner menu are the antipasto of duckling crespella , a tender crepe filled with sumptuous duck meat and glazed with sweet and sharp Cremona mustard , and the warm branzino ( sea_bass ) carpaccio in a creamy light tomato_sauce studded with corn . The rustic soup of bitter chicory stirred into a rough puree of vegetables and fava_beans is terrific . A couple of times , we had the time -- and the appetite -- for the secondi : an enormous platter of shrimp and scampi cooked in their shells ( heads on ) in brandy sauce and a breaded pork chop in a boldly tart lemon sauce . The taste of the food is so authentic that it ' s easy to see why Italian winemakers on_tour head straight for Primi , where they know they ' ll finally get some food that really tastes like home . Having eaten my way through most of the menu at Primi , I feel the same way . Piero Selvaggio and Enrico Glaudo have won my heart -- my Italian heart -- and next time I won ' t even open the menu ; I will ask the chef to make whatever he wants . Primi , Un Ristorante , 10543 W . Pico Blvd. , Los Angeles ; ( 310 ) 475-9235 . Open for lunch Monday through Friday , for dinner Monday through Saturday . Valet parking . Major credit_cards accepted . Lunch for two , food only , $ 25 to $ 40 ; dinner for two , food only , $ 60 to $ 80 .</TEXT>
