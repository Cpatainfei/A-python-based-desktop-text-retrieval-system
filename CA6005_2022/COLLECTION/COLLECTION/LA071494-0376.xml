   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON REPORT BLAMES HUMAN ERROR IN COPTER TRAGEDY ; MILITARY : DEFENSE CHIEF ORDERS MAJOR SHUFFLING OF OPERATIONS OF AWACS AIRCRAFT . HE CONCURS THAT TWO OFFICERS SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF THEIR DUTIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Pentagon said Wednesday that the downing of two Army helicopters by U.S. fighters over Iraq last April was caused by a wide range of avoidable human error and it announced a sweeping overhaul of military flight procedures to prevent further accidents . Calling the mishap &quot; a tragedy that never should have happened , &quot; Defense_Secretary William J . Perry approved recommendations that a general and another officer be relieved of their duties and told top commanders to decide whether others should face punitive action . He also ordered a major shuffling of the operations of Air_Force AWACS radar surveillance planes , which an investigative report Wednesday blamed as a major factor_in the tragedy in which 26 people were killed . The 21-volume report was the result of thousands of hours of analysis and interviews with more_than 130 witnesses , including the pilots of the two F-15C fighters who fired the missiles that downed the two helicopters . It clearly stunned the Defense_Department leadership . Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , told reporters at a press_conference that the investigation showed &quot; there were a shocking number of instances in which individuals failed to do their jobs properly. &quot; The general relieved of his duties was Air_Force Brig . Gen . Jeffrey Scott Pilkington , who had been co-commander , along with a Turkish officer , of the U.S.-led operation to enforce the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone in northern Iraq . Pentagon officials said that the &quot; senior missions supervisor &quot; for the AWACS operation also was relieved of his duties but they declined to disclose his name , pending further investigation . There was no indication whether he might be disciplined in the case . Much of what was contained in Wednesday ' s report by a board of inquiry already had been disclosed , either in previous remarks by Pentagon officials or by the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers in recent weeks . The document showed , for example , that the lead F-15C pilot mistook the two U.S. helicopters for Iraqi planes , and that his wingman , who was piloting the second fighter , did not try to prevent the shooting even though he could not confirm the identification . The report also confirmed earlier speculation that the transponders carried by the two helicopters to identify them as American did not transmit the proper coded signals -- though it said investigators have been unable to determine why the devices apparently malfunctioned . But the investigators meted_out the lion ' s share of the blame for the tragedy to the crew of the radar-surveillance plane , which it said failed to warn the F-15Cs and the Blackhawks of each other ' s presence , even though it had both sets of aircraft on its radar screens . And it cited &quot; a breakdown in command_guidance and supervision &quot; throughout the entire &quot; no-fly &quot; zone enforcement operation in northern Iraq , from a failure to integrate fighter and helicopter activities to a laxity in updating rules by which the F-15C fighters are permitted to attack an enemy . The document said that the AWACS crew erroneously believed that it was not responsible_for monitoring helicopter flights or for coordinating them with fighter operations and did not take a series of routine steps that could have prevented the tragedy . And it said the mission crew commander of the AWACS squadron , who had flown only one sortie in the three previous months , &quot; was not currently qualified in accordance with Air_Force regulations. &quot; Ominously , the report said that both the senior mission commander and the controller in_charge of the area declined to testify on the advice of their lawyers , leaving investigators unable to tell whether they had activated a key warning_device . The report said that the investigators also were missing a four-minute segment of videotape from the AWACS plane , which was lost when a crew_member recorded something else over it . But it said the slip appeared to be inadvertent and authorities were able to reconstruct the information . Perry said Wednesday that the Pentagon already has changed flight procedures to help prevent such incidents in the future -- including consolidating air-control for helicopter and fighter flights and tightening the conditions under which a U.S. jet can fire upon another plane . But he also made clear that he had become very much displeased with the way the Air_Force was operating its fleet of AWACS planes , which until now had been regarded_as elite units . He ordered a major overhaul of procedures and training for AWACS crews throughout the Air_Force , particularly for joint operations involving the Air_Force and other services . Such operations have become more common in combat situations . And he directed the Pentagon ' s four-service &quot; joint staff &quot; to develop new guidelines for interservice operations that take_account of lessons the military has learned from the April 14 incident . The accident was the second tragedy this year in which errors by Air_Force controllers were a critical factor . The other , a collision between an F-16D fighter and a C-130 transport over a North Carolina base in March , killed 23 and injured 100 . * WIDOW ' S QUESTIONS : Aviator ' s widow finds officer ' s explanation unhelpful . B1 BACKGROUND The &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over northern Iraq was established by the United States and its allies just after the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War to prevent the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from raiding and killing Kurdish tribesmen who lived_in that part of the country .</TEXT>
