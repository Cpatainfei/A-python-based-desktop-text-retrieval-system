   <HEADLINE> THE FALL COLLECTIONS / MILAN ; LAYERING IT ON ; COMBOS OF JACKETS OVER ( TUNICS AND DRESSES ) AND UNDER ( TOPCOATS ) TAKE TO THE RUNWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even Giorgio Armani seems flummoxed by the season . The Italian master of cool restraint put_on a show Wednesday night that left one wondering whether he saw women as men , with hair greased flat against their heads , or as goddesses whose beaded gowns appeared too imposing for anything more_than a polite handshake . How strange too for Armani to dwell_on layers of jackets and tunics when last season he made his clothes look so light they might well have been weightless . Now , for fall , he seems hung_up on the disproportion of a longer blouse or tunic under a jacket , which looked cumbersome when the tunic was the length of a skirt and the model had_on pants . It came as a relief , then , when another model appeared in a gray bird ' s-eye tweed jacket over a fluted short dress in semi-transparent gray jersey . At least she did not have to bear the extra meter of inconvenience . The pleasure of watching an Armani show is seeing how he solves problems by the shortest route possible . But in this collection , he seemed to create more obstacles than he eliminated . If showing tunic-like dresses softens wardrobes thick_with jackets , why add heavy leggings with built-in boots ? Likewise , there are only so many ways in which the jacket can be reinvented , but if one of the tenets of modern dressing is deconstruction , why then add rippling lapels to a jacket that otherwise looked as unstructured as a cardigan ? So it was hard to get a handle on this collection . There were plenty of jackets in fabrics with textures that ranged from waffle to herringbone , chenille to plush , and some very fine separates , including loose crepe blouses with open collars and taut T-shirts made of what appeared to be sheer wool . But the prints ( vaguely ethnic ) looked passe , and the color register barely got above dusty pinks and blues . In a season crying_out_for color , even a single spot of red would have helped to clarify all_the beige . As for the evening_clothes , there was hardly_a gown or pants ensemble that didn ' t have a clacking swish of beads . It ' s hard to believe that such dresses , if they ever get produced , will make a woman feel that she is more_than just a pretty object on a pedestal . At Fendi , nothing was quite as it seemed . Karl Lagerfeld sent_out a torrent of coats and practically defied his audience to tell which were made of wool , suede , fur or fake fur . Some were actually double coats with an interior of fur and a removable outer shell of opaque nylon that looked_like a protective bag . Many were traversed with mohair or Angora cross-stitching , giving the coats a kind of primitive feel , as though they had been stitched together in the caves of various Ugs and Ergs . For some time now , Lagerfeld has been treating fur as an anti-status object , even to_the_point of slicing pelts with holes or , this season , piercing them with rings and letting the sleeves hang down below the fingertips , the way fashion people do with their shirt cuffs . The attitude for fall is less destructive , and the furs ( mink , sable , mole and weasel ) drape and lap around the body with the same insouciance as an old flannel shirt with a sweater tied around the waist . The difference , of course , is incomparable technique , and for that Lagerfeld has the excellent Fendi workrooms . Occasionally you get some sense of the inanity of fashion in the face of Sarajevo and Hebron when designers try to turn a runway into a world peace summit . The Complice show Wednesday added_up to a U.N. stockpile of Red Army coats , subcontinental saris , Nordic knits and Third_World fake fur . This was Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana mimicking Jean Paul Gaultier and Martin Margiela , but with the commercial mentality of a Benetton store . So you got navy blazers finished_off with a maxi-length of tartan , orange down jackets over transparent black dresses , velvet track pants with sneakers , and distressed leather jeans with unfinished shearling coats . Item by item , many of the pieces worked ; the rusted effect of the leathers and the surplus style of the army coats were at least thoughtful . But the rest didn ' t require any more insight than what can be gleaned on a morning at the flea_market . The object of Gianni Versace ' s desire on Tuesday evening seemed to be schoolyard , with its egg-cream colors played_out on fabrics with that E-Z Kleen shine . There was , to be sure , something rather kinky about violet and pink empire dresses that looked as though they had been recently hosed_down . And the sight of Helena Christensen in nothing but a shiny-black bibbed overall skirt made one wonder if maybe she weren ' t working the wrong street . But , clearly , Versace was in his element , and while the clothes may have looked as slippery as a biker bar , the message was an unvarnished statement about women . Behind the plastic-coated skirts and leggings , the silver bomber_jackets and collegiate turtlenecks sparkling with Lurex , there was the shape of fashion to come . Lagerfeld set the course last fall with his spare schoolgirl suits and paint-box colors , and now Versace has applied his own formula of frank sex_appeal to this essentially innocent look . By next year , when the glamour pusses cross their legs in the lobby of the Four Seasons , they ' ll be encased in mint green and gunmetal . By comparison , Jil Sander ' s Tuesday show amounted to a whisper in dark . The German designer took refuge in the somber clothes for which she is known -- the streamlined pantsuits , fluid overcoats and spare skirts that for fall will come_in hues of cocoa , charcoal and berry-brown . A year ago , she had succeeded in whittling_down her clothes to a bare minimum of construction ; now , in double-faced wool and knit jersey , they looked positively cut_to the bone . There was also something redundant about the collection , and it may be that other designers have simply caught_on to her small-shouldered jackets , her lean lines and the cool frankness of her monochromatic palette . What looked new , apart from the gored double-faced wool suits , were coats and pantsuits in black velveteen . A zippered stadium parka opened over a simple black georgette dress , setting_up a more subdued contrast between two matte surfaces . The designer tried to make a similar play with gowns made of vertical or asymmetrical pieces of chiffon and georgette , but these peek-a-boo effects seem to have played_out . Likewise , a passage of ivory mohair knits left no impression other_than that they might be irritating . Perhaps , in the end , what was missing from this show was the element of surprise : a burst of color , a treasured vest , a little something to give these clothes juice .</TEXT>
