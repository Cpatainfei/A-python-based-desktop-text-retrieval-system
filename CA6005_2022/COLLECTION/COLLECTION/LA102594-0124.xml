   <HEADLINE> GTE TO PROVIDE QUICK-CONNECT 411 SERVICE ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : PHONE_COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH LOCAL CELLULAR FIRMS TO OFFER DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE THAT DIALS NUMBER FOR THE CALLER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With characteristic quietness , GTE of California in the past few months has snapped_up lucrative contracts to provide new directory-assistance services for cellular_phone companies in the state . It ' s a tiny business for GTE of California in Thousand Oaks , a unit of giant GTE Corp. , which is the nation ' s largest independent phone_company , with $ 20 billion in annual revenue . But operator services generally are highly profitable for local phone_companies , and GTE ' s new operations stand to benefit from the explosive growth of the cellular_phone industry . In California , GTE won the contracts over other providers of directory services , including Pacific Bell . The new services allow a cellular subscriber to call 411 for a phone_number , then the option of being directly connected with that number . These so-called quick-connect directory services are being introduced around the country , and they save customers from having to hang_up and dial the number -- something thought to be particularly appealing when the caller is driving a car . Another feature of the new cellular 411 services provided by GTE is that callers anywhere in the Los Angeles area do not have to dial an outside area_code , then 555-1212 , to obtain a number in a different area_code . A caller in the 818 area_code , for instance , could dial 411 and obtain a phone_number in the 714 area_code . GTE is providing these directory-assistance services for AirTouch Communications Inc. , L.A. Cellular and GTE Mobilnet , the cellular arm of GTE Corp . That means when subscribers of these cellular_phone companies dial 411 , a GTE operator answers and has the ability to put the call through . GTE initially offered to provide the services to cellular operators in California and Hawaii , but is now hoping to expand the business nationwide , said Jay Burrell , product manager for wireless services at GTE Telephone Operations in Irving , Tex . Providing new services to cellular operators is being aggressively pursued by GTE and others because the cellular_phone industry is expected to grow 30 % a year . What ' s more , local phone_companies increasingly are forced to seek new revenue sources because of regulatory and pricing changes in their traditional business , and the likely opening of local phone markets to competition from cable TV and long-distance phone_companies . Providing new services to cellular_phone companies &quot; is such a natural fit &quot; for GTE , said Burrell . &quot; We ' re spending a great_deal of effort to be the best out there. &quot; Other 411 services that might soon be offered include theater listings and directions to certain destinations , Burrell said . Also in the near future , GTE plans to provide all these services in Spanish . The directory-services business has &quot; pretty good growth prospects , &quot; said analyst Robert B . Wilkes at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York . Witness , he said , the announcement earlier this month by long-distance phone_company MCI Communications Inc. of its new service allowing callers to dial a single toll-free number to find just about any published phone_number in the United States or overseas . MCI will also offer to automatically dial the number for no extra charge . But 90 % of directory-assistance calls are for local numbers . And that business stands to expand with the increasing use of cellular_phones . The first local cellular company to go on-line with the new 411 services was GTE Mobilnet , which debuted the services in April in its California markets , including five area_codes in central and Northern California . All cellular callers to 411 are now automatically connected to the numbers for 60 cents per call . A regular 25-cent directory-assistance call without the direct-connection feature now requires dialing a number other_than 411 . David Avirom , marketing manager for GTE Mobilnet in California , said that , although GTE is providing the new services for its cellular arm , bids from other companies were also considered . Avirom said that usage of the call completion feature among cellular subscribers so far is nearly 100 % . AirTouch began its new 411 services in the Los Angeles area in June . GTE has in the past provided 411 services for AirTouch within the local calling areas that GTE serves . But &quot; this is a very different animal than what we did before , &quot; said Melissa May , an AirTouch spokeswoman . The changes required &quot; a whole new contract &quot; with GTE . Although AirTouch was spun_off in April from the parent of Pacific Bell , May said AirTouch chose GTE for the new services over a competing bid from Pacific Bell because GTE offered &quot; better service at a better price. &quot; An AirTouch 411 call costs 33 cents , and if the customer pushes a button to be automatically dialed through , there is no additional charge . The new services are in_effect throughout Los Angeles , Orange , Ventura , San Bernardino and Riverside counties . The company hopes to expand them statewide in early 1995 , at which time a cellular customer could call 411 for a number anywhere in California . Pacific Bell previously provided L.A. Cellular ' s 411 services , said Mike Cymbrowsky , senior marketing manager for L.A. Cellular . But earlier this month , under a new contract with GTE , L.A. Cellular also began offering customers the ability to make a 25-cent 411 call , and for an additional 50 cents be connected with the number . A customer need only dial 411 for any number in the company ' s service_area of Los Angeles , Orange , San Bernardino and Riverside counties . GTE ' s Burrell would n ' t say , but it ' s a good bet that GTE is also hoping to win a contract to provide similar services to the remaining major cellular_phone company in the state . McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. , which operates in various parts of California as Cellular One , is planning to add new directory services within the next several months , said Sylvia Schnopp , marketing coordinator for Cellular One ' s south coast district .</TEXT>
