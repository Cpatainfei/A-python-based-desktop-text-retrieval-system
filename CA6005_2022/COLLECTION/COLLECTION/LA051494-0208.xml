   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN RULING PARTY TAKES SOME STATIC DURING FIRST NATIONAL TELEVISION DEBATE ; DEMOCRACY : POLLS SHOW PRI LOSES SEVEN POINTS BUT STILL LEADS . OPPOSITION CANDIDATE CARDENAS DROPS TO THIRD PLACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This nation ' s ruling party took a historic step toward opening the Mexican political_system by participating in the first nationwide televised debate among presidential candidates -- and found Friday that the move was costly . Flash polls showed that the Thursday night debate trimmed up_to seven points from the impressive lead of Ernesto Zedillo , the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI . But the Yale-educated economist remained in first place , with 38 % of those questioned saying they would make him president , according to polls conducted immediately after the 90-minute encounter . Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , the reticent candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party , or PRD , appeared to have suffered the most . He dropped from second to third place in flash voter polls in major cities . Cardenas , who refused to wear makeup for the cameras , is known for a deadpan style that appeals_to rural voters . Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , candidate of the right-wing National Action Party , or PAN , clearly won the debate , up_to two-thirds of those questioned in four polls said . Viewers said they found him clear , convincing , knowledgeable and realistic . He was also responsible_for the debate ' s few moments of humor , such_as when he told Zedillo , &quot; You are a good boy with high grades , but in democracy , you flunked. &quot; Fernandez , who gained a reputation as a debater when in the Mexican Congress , more_than doubled his support , moving from third place to a solid second in the presidential race , based on a poll conducted by the independent newspaper Reforma . The newspaper surveyed a focus group , not the electorate at_large . And its quick results , like those of all flash polls , contain significant margins of error , especially since the election is still months away , analysts cautioned . But Thursday ' s debate offered the most visible sign of the nascent democratic reforms that are growing increasingly evident here as Mexico approaches its Aug . 21 presidential elections . &quot; The debate . . . is a great step_forward in Mexico ' s democratic life and reflects the new political culture that our great nation is experiencing , &quot; President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said . &quot; This change . . . is also the product of the electoral reforms that have been achieved through dialogue with the various political factions in our great country. &quot; Reforms providing_for citizen observers at voter precincts and turning control of the Federal Electoral Commission , which runs elections , over to citizens from the political_parties were passed_by Congress late Thursday . The government this week also asked the United Nations to advise Mexican election observers and to issue a report on the computerized electoral_system . Citizens have been invited to audit voter rolls and to inspect the computer center where ballots will be counted . All these measures are a clear attempt to avoid charges of fraud that marred the 1988 presidential election and many other votes before and since . Thursday ' s televised candidate confrontation played an important role in promoting a democratic image for Mexico . &quot; The debate had the enormous challenge of restoring confidence in the political_system , which it succeeded in doing , &quot; media analyst Raul Trejo said . &quot; It exceeded expectations. &quot; Fernandez and Cardenas , who many Mexicans believe was cheated out of a victory in the 1988 presidential election , attacked 65 years of rule by a single party , the PRI . While Cardenas largely ignored Fernandez , the PAN candidate energetically criticized Cardenas , a former PRI governor , who he said is obsessed with becoming president . &quot; You have one face in the opposition and another in the government , &quot; Fernandez said . Fernandez promised an end to the near-dictatorial powers of the presidency by strengthening the judicial and legislative_branches of the federal_government as well as state and municipal_governments . Cardenas , meantime , took a page from former President Ronald Reagan ' s debate book , charging , &quot; No one is_better off than in 1988. &quot; He promised an economic_policy that takes people into account and a convention to revise the much-amended Mexican constitution . Analysts said that in trying to counteract a radical image , Cardenas looked as if he lacked fervor ; he lost support as a result . Zedillo , a former education minister , emphasized his campaign promises of turning economic_growth into jobs , improving schools and reforming the criminal justice system to eliminate corruption and insecurity . The debate took_place in an atmosphere of increasing political awareness among Mexicans . More_than 90 % of the voting-age population -- 43 million people -- have registered to vote and picked_up their photo identification . That awareness is expected to increase as a result of the debate , which an estimated 30 million television viewers saw , besides Mexicans who listened on the radio . &quot; The debate is . . . very important , &quot; said Jose Angel Gurria , PRI ' s secretary of international affairs . &quot; It will have the salutary effect of interesting people in the process. &quot;</TEXT>
