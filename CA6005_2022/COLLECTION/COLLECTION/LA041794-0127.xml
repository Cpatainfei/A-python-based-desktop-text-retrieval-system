   <HEADLINE> A REPUBLICAN COULD BEAT CLINTON IN ' 96 -- BUT WHO ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Who says you can ' t beat somebody with nobody ? One recent poll asked Americans to choose between Bill Clin ton and &quot; the Republican_Party ' s candidate for President. &quot; Result ? Clinton got 43 % of the vote . The ghost Republican beat him with 50 % . Clinton ' s 43 % may sound familiar . It ' s exactly what he got_in the 1992 election . Clinton has kept his support . But he hasn ' t expanded it . And he can ' t win a two-way race unless he expands it . You can win a three -way race with 43 % of the vote , of course . that ' s what Clinton did_in 1992 . What happens today if you throw Ross Perot into the mix ? Amazingly , Perot still gets_about 20 % -- the same vote he got_in 1992 . Perot may have disappeared from the news since the catastrophic debate over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement last November . But he has kept his support . With Perot in the mix , Clinton edges out the unnamed Republican by three points . Just as he edged out George_Bush by five points in 1992 . Perot has not been too friendly to Clinton , and his followers aren ' t either . Take Perot off the ballot and his supporters go_for the unnamed Republican 3 to 1 over Clinton . Bottom_line : Democrats had better hope Perot runs in 1996 . They need him to split the anti-Clinton vote . Notice something interesting about these poll results ? Nothing much has changed since 1992 . As bad as that is for the Democrats , it ' s even worse for the Republicans . They lost in 1992 . And they have no &quot; man to beat &quot; for 1996 . The &quot; man to beat &quot; is an important title in U.S. politics . Whoever holds that title is the leader of the opposition . Right now , the title is vacant . This is surprising because , as the poll shows , the 1996 GOP nomination may be worth having . But the field is wide open . When Republicans were asked which of 14 potential candidates they favored for the ' 96 presidential nomination , Sen . Bob Dole of Kansas topped the list -- at 20 % . Next came two men who may_not even be Republicans -- retired Gen . Colin L . Powell and Perot . The only other contender to earn double_digits was former Vice_President Dan Quayle ( 11 % ) . It ' s unusual for a party not to have a &quot; man to beat &quot; two years before a presidential election . How does someone get that title ? For a party out of power , the title often goes_to the most recent vice_president . After the 1964 Barry M . Goldwater debacle , former Vice_President Richard M . Nixon was the Republicans ' man to beat for 1968 . After the Democrats got wiped_out in 1980 , Jimmy_Carter ' s vice_president , Walter F . Mondale , became the man to beat for 1984 . So the title ought to go_to Quayle . He is doing what he can to raise his stature . He did a potato-chip commercial . He ' s writing a book . He ' s building bridges to the religious right . But let ' s face it . It is rarely said of Quayle , as it was of Julius Caesar , that &quot; he doth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus , and we petty men walk under his huge legs. &quot; In the past , the &quot; man to beat &quot; often went_to losers -- candidates who were nominated before and lost . Thomas E . Dewey was nominated by the GOP in 1944 and lost to Franklin D . Roosevelt . After Roosevelt died in 1945 , Dewey became the GOP front-runner for 1948 . Adlai E . Stevenson lost to Dwight D . Eisenhower in 1952 . Then the Democrats nominated him again , in 1956 , just to make_sure . The record holder in this category is William Jennings Bryan . The Democrats nominated Bryan in 1896 . He lost to William McKinley . They nominated Bryan again in 1900 . He lost to McKinley again . The Democrats figured_out that maybe this wasn ' t such a good idea -- Bryan was kind of radical -- so they nominated Judge Alton Parker , a conservative , in 1904 . He lost , too . In 1908 , it was back to Bryan , who lost a third time . Nixon lost in 1960 , then lost for California governor in 1962 . In 1968 , he was resurrected from the political dead and won the presidency -- twice . Then he went_on to prove what the country should have learned the first time . Once a loser , always a loser . The last time a loser became the &quot; man to beat &quot; was Edmund S . Muskie before the 1972 election . Muskie had been the Democrats ' vice presidential nominee in 1968 , and vice presidential candidates are rarely blamed for the party ' s loss . In fact , Muskie was such a formidable &quot; man to beat &quot; that the Nixon White_House broke_into the Democratic National Committee ' s offices at the Watergate looking_for material on him . These days , however , losers don ' t become the &quot; man to beat. &quot; They become the man to forget . Like &quot; what ' s his name ? &quot; , the Massachusetts liberal the Democrats nominated in 1988 . Or Bush . Has an incumbent President ever lost the White_House and then gone_on to win it back ? Yes . Once . Grover Cleveland , a Democrat , in 1892 . Bush is probably immersed in Cleveland ' s biography right now . But here ' s a clue : That was 100 years ago , and it ain ' t gonna happen again . Another way to become the &quot; man to beat &quot; is to run_for the nomination , lose to someone else and then watch your party go_down to defeat . That gives you a powerful message : &quot; I told you so. &quot; Ronald Reagan became the GOP ' s &quot; man to beat &quot; for 1980 , after he lost the nomination to Gerald R . Ford in 1976 . Gary Hart became the Democrats ' &quot; man to beat &quot; for 1988 , after he lost out_to Mondale in 1984 . Now let ' s see , who would be the GOP ' s Mr. &quot; I told you so &quot; in 1996 ? Answer : Patrick J . Buchanan . Never mind . The &quot; man to beat &quot; is often a figure of stature in the party . that ' s what Robert Taft was for the Republicans in 1952 and Nelson A . Rockefeller was for the GOP in 1964 . They both lost the nomination . On the Democratic side , Edward M . Kennedy was the &quot; man to beat &quot; for 1976 and Mario M . Cuomo was the &quot; man to beat &quot; for 1992 . They both declined to run just before the campaign started . Figures of stature have a big problem . They are usually Washington insiders or identified with the party Establishment -- like Taft , Rockefeller , Kennedy and Cuomo . that ' s death in this populist era . Who is the GOP ' s current figure of stature ? Why Dole , of course . Dole is Mr. Washington , the consummate insider and the quintessential Establishment figure . He ' s also a senior statesman ( he ' ll be 73 in 1996 ) . And he ' s been around the track a_few times -- once for vice_president ( 1976 ) and twice for President ( 1980 and 1988 ) . Great credentials for a leader of the opposition . Not so great as the Republicans ' hope for the future . What about Jack Kemp and William J . Bennett and Dick Cheney and Lamar Alexander and Carroll A . Campbell Jr . and William Weld and Pete Wilson and James A . Baker III and Phil Gramm ? All worthy souls and good , patriotic Americans . But none is the &quot; man to beat. &quot; Even the GOP factions have no leaders . Conservative Republicans do not have a champion ; the first choice of self-described conservatives for the GOP nomination is Dole , at 20 % . Moderate Republicans do not have a champion ; the first choice of moderates for the GOP nomination is Dole , at 20 % . Even the religious right has no champion , which is why Quayle keeps showing_up at their forums . In short , it looks_like the Republicans face a wide-open brawl in 1996 , just like the Democrats did_in 1976 and 1988 . But there ' s one big difference . The primary season used to be an epic drama . Now it ' s a miniseries . Two thirds of the delegates will be chosen in the first five weeks -- before the California primary on March 26 . That kind of foreshortened nominating season is tailor-made for a &quot; man to beat. &quot; Only there isn ' t one . So a candidate is likely to emerge from the pack quickly ( in New Hampshire , as usual ) and then sew up the nomination in record time ( in New York , as usual ) . Then the party will have seven months to figure_out who they ' ve nominated. *</TEXT>
