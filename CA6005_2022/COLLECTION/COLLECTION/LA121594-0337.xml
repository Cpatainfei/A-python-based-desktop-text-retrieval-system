   <TEXT> Prime_Minister John Major declared Wednesday that Northern_Ireland has reached an optimistic &quot; turning point &quot; in its future as he announced about $ 100 million in new business investment that will create 300 jobs for the troubled province . During an overnight visit to Belfast , the capital_of_Northern_Ireland , Major said there are few days when one can say with confidence , &quot; I can see the future. &quot; He said Wednesday was one of those days . Major told a meeting launching one of the new projects , British Telecom ' s $ 46-million offices in Belfast , that there is a general atmosphere of optimism in the province now that the paramilitary groups there have observed a cease-fire for several months . The gathering was part of a two-day international business conference . &quot; If we can keep the political talks successfully on track and economic development rolling as it is now continuing to roll , &quot; Major said , &quot; then the prospects for Northern_Ireland are very bright indeed , not just in the short term but in the long term . &quot; The peace process that is now unfolding is not yet certain , but it is developing in a way few people would have envisaged just a_few months ago. &quot; Major said news_reports on the province have too long been dominated by &quot; the troubles &quot; -- the violence that racked Northern_Ireland for 25 years -- when in fact it has become an attractive place for business investment . About 250 delegates attended the Belfast conference , which was marred only by the walkout of six delegates from Sinn Fein , the political arm of the_Irish Republican Army , and representatives from Belfast and Londonderry over the_British Northern_Ireland Office ' s refusal to increase the size of their delegation . Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , leading an American delegation , said that U.S. firms &quot; will take full advantage of the dramatically improved climate &quot; in Northern_Ireland .</TEXT>
