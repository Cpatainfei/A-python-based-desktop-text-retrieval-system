   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; GENETIC TESTING : CAN WE KNOW TOO MUCH ? ; UC IRVINE PROFESSOR FORESEES ETHICAL DILEMMAS AS IT BECOMES EASIER TO PREDICT BIRTH_DEFECTS , BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To UC Irvine Prof . John J . Wasmuth , it is not speculation . It is a certainty . Three years from now a woman who suspects she is pregnant will go_to her physician for tests . The physician will scrape a_few cells from the 10-week-old fetus and send them off for genetic analysis . It will be routine ; the results will come_back in only a_few days . The baby will be male . He will not have any of the more common , catastrophic birth_defects . So far , so good . He will be prone to colon_cancer in midlife . that ' s good to know . We can watch for that and treat it . And he will be 20 times more likely to be severely schizophrenic or psychotic before he ' s 20 years old . We can ' t say it will happen , only that it is much more likely to happen . Does the woman abort ? This is social dynamite , and the fuse is already burning . Though genes that cause disease are being discovered , on average , about once a month , that rate will accelerate rapidly , Wasmuth says . Yet measures to prevent or treat these disorders will lag many years behind . Although Wasmuth , a professor of biological chemistry , has worked more_than a decade to discover or help discover these genetic defects and the simple tests to diagnose them , he says he knows that gene testing can lead -- will lead -- parents into agonizing dilemmas . * Aborting a child certain to die within a_few months of birth may_not seem a difficult decision to some , but what about a child with a 50-50 chance of a life made miserable by incurable disease ? * What about a healthy , mentally intact child who will suffer from society ' s prejudice ? Dwarfism can be detected now in fetuses , and some researchers speculate that detecting the tendency toward homosexuality may be in_store . * More_than diseases will be discerned from gene analysis . The genes controlling intelligence and body size will be discovered sooner or later . Will some parents abort children too small for football or too dim for college ? Wasmuth says he has seen the effects of such discoveries on others and on_his_own family . After locating the gene that causes the most common form of dwarfism , he discovered a case in which a dwarf wanted his pregnant wife to be tested . If the child was not going_to be a dwarf , the father wanted an abortion . &quot; He wanted a ' normal ' child , and to him , a dwarf is normal , &quot; Wasmuth says . &quot; This is just the other side of the coin . These are not simple issues. &quot; And they are very emotional , too , as Wasmuth discovered when his daughter became pregnant last year . Early ultrasound tests showed something in the fetus that might indicate a mind-destroying defect . Gene tests would settle the question , and Wasmuth ' s daughter sought his advice . Wasmuth , to his surprise , advised against testing . &quot; To anyone else , I ' d have said : ' It ' s the smart thing to do . Have the test . You can rule_out the disease , at least . &quot; But this was my daughter , and it was very scary , &quot; Wasmuth says . &quot; I ' d been doing this research for 15 or 20 years , and now it was like it brought my daughter down into my world . It was right in my face . &quot; My first inclination was , ' The chances of this happening are so slim , don ' t worry about it . Forget about it. ' I admit , it was a backwards reaction on my part , but this was my daughter. &quot; But his 28-year-old daughter , Michele Bones , a computer_programming instructor , came from her home_in San Diego to UCI for the gene tests , &quot; and we had to wait for two weeks . She handled it better than I did ; I was a basket case. &quot; The tests proved negative , and Wasmuth ' s perfectly normal grandson was born in November . But he concedes that &quot; this influenced me more_than anything else. &quot; Now , Wasmuth says , he ' s worried about how the discoveries he and other genetics researchers are making might be misused . &quot; Once you find the mutation that causes the genetic_disorder and you put the information out there , people can use it any way they want , and I guess that ' s what bothers me . You hope it will be used to the benefit of everyone , but you know that certainly is not always going_to be the case . &quot; We haven ' t been very good at long-range planning , have we ? We had no idea of the implications of splitting the atom . Now we can have the information that would allow us to substitute our personal selection for natural_selection . &quot; What should be tested for , and should we test everybody ? If we test everybody , what disease do you eliminate through abortion and what disease do you sort of just let alone and say let natural evolution take its course ? We may be really changing the evolution of the entire species in some way we don ' t understand . that ' s a little far-fetched in some cases , but I think in a lot of cases it ' s not out of the question. &quot; Cystic fibrosis is a powerful example , Wasmuth says . The disease , produced when a child gets a defective gene from each parent , affects the lungs and is invariably fatal , usually before age 12 . &quot; Natural_selection always has , and probably always will , select out such a catastrophic defect . If it did nothing good , you ' d expect it to be gone forever by now . But it ' s not ; it ' s amazingly common . One in every 20 Caucasians carries it . &quot; So there ' s a good possibility that this gene is involved in something beneficial that we don ' t know about . Personally , I believe the disease is a side_effect of something else , something important , that we haven ' t found_out about yet . &quot; It seems obvious at first -- just get_rid_of this horrible defective gene -- but I ' m worried that we won ' t have the insight to manage such things wisely. &quot; For the power to reach_into human genes and change them &quot; is not that far off , &quot; Wasmuth says . &quot; It can be done_in mice right now . If it can be done_in mice , it won ' t be too long before it can be done_in humans . Ethically and legally it ' s not going_to happen for a long_time , but technically it could be done fairly soon. &quot; These are relatively new worries for Wasmuth , he concedes . &quot; When I first started , I hadn ' t even considered it. &quot; He started in Greenville , a small farming community in southern Illinois . Born in 1946 to a grocer and a registered nurse , he developed a passion in high_school for sports and science . They turned_out to have more in common than he thought . &quot; In science , being competitive makes a lot of difference , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a competitive world , more_than most . No one ever remembers who made a discovery second. &quot; No one in Wasmuth ' s family had ever earned a college degree . &quot; The people I knew there either didn ' t go_to college and stayed in town or they went_to college and didn ' t come back. &quot; Wasmuth joined the latter group and set_off for Southern Illinois University with medical_school in mind . The path led through Purdue University and the Baylor College of Medicine , where a genetics professor took Wasmuth under his wing . Not surprisingly , medical_school was eclipsed by an increasing interest in the clinical aspects of genetics , Wasmuth says . By then he had married Judy Schwierjohn , &quot; a real , bona_fide German . Her parents were farmers in Illinois , and we had been high_school sweethearts. &quot; They have been married 30 years and now live_in a large house overlooking Lake Mission Viejo . His wife works for a firm that auctions real_estate . His introduction to genetics at Baylor changed his life , Wasmuth says . Until then he had envisioned a teaching career &quot; at some reasonably sized college . It would be a nice , sedate way to make a living , I thought . But the more I got_into genetics , the more I liked research , and that means a high-powered university. &quot; In 1977 , Wasmuth was hired at UC Irvine to teach biochemistry to first-year medical_students and to conduct the research of his choosing . &quot; I ' m really not sure how I wound_up here , but once I got here , everything really sort of fell_into_place . UCI was a good career move . There was not much genetics being done here. &quot; Wasmuth began basic genetics research , shifting in the 1980s to intensive research into gene defects that cause disease . In 1993 , he established UCI as one of the 16 universities with a Human Genome Center , a part of the National Institutes of Health ' s long-term effort to map the location and purpose of every human gene . It ' s a monumental task , Wasmuth says , &quot; probably the most difficult yet most interesting thing in biology. &quot; It appeals_to him , he says , for the same reason mystery_stories appeal_to him . &quot; You have clues all along the way , and you really have to think_about them . To me , this is just the biggest mystery of all. &quot; Gene-mapping is literally code-breaking , for the string of molecules in a gene is eerily like computer_code . No one knows the method this genetic code uses to instruct its cell in how to form and what to do , but the code itself can be read . Laboratory equipment can take sections of genes and print out their sequences as a string of letters . The genetic alphabet has only four letters -- A , C , G and T -- each representing one of the four kinds of coding molecules . The sequence carries the meaning . Just as ..- means U but -.. means D in Morse_code , A-T-G means this is the beginning of a gene sequence but T-A-A means this is the end . What lies between may be a string of 1 # 000 molecules , but it may also be as_many as 1 million . There are 3 billion coding molecules in a complete set of human genes , and just one misplaced molecule can cause immense changes in human development . Researchers like Wasmuth search for that molecule by meticulously comparing the genes of afflicted people with the genes of normal people . Find the sequence in all_the afflicted that is never seen in the normal , and you ' ve solved the mystery . You have also laid a foundation for future research , for if your gene causes , say , dwarfism , it must be in a gene that affects bone growth . Those seeking the genes for other genetically induced bone disorders are sure to search that region once your results are published . This is the reason the pace of discoveries is accelerating , Wasmuth says . Disease-causing genes are being discovered about once a month now , but the rate could easily reach once a week by 1999 . The pace will probably slow as the causes of more complex , multi-gene disorders are sought , he says . Theoretically , every aspect of human physical development could eventually be determined by examining the genes of a person born or unborn . But practically , how much do people want to know ? A decade ago , people with a family history of Huntington ' s disease , a disorder that sets_in at midlife and slowly drags its victim toward dementia and death , were asked if they would like to be tested for the disease if a test were available . About three in four said yes , Wasmuth says . Yet when a test became available , enthusiasm waned . About half said they did not want to be tested . &quot; When it is sort of a theoretical thing , people say , ' Sure , I ' d do_it , &quot; ' Wasmuth says . &quot; But when it ' s time to sit_down and do_it -- you ' re 35 and we ' re going to test you to see whether you have 10 instead of maybe 40 good years left -- well , you just don ' t know what you ' ll say until you ' re there . Is ignorance bliss ? &quot; And knowledge will be even more painful when it is not certain , Wasmuth says . Most reports will not be yes or no with 100 % certainty . They will be probabilities , like odds in a casino -- one chance in five that your baby will be a lifetime burden rather than a blessing . &quot; I think uncertain answers will cause more anxiety than no answers at all . Having an uncertain answer and the option to abort ? Right now people say no , I don ' t want to know . It happens . &quot; I know a lot of people who had a prenatal diagnosis where the child clearly was going_to have Down ' s syndrome and they go_ahead . They wanted the child , and they have the child . Others abort . Neither one can understand the other one . It ' s a very personal decision , and no one can make the decision for anybody else. &quot; Wasmuth was raised a Catholic , a religion dead_set against abortion , but he says he has modified his thinking and is no longer a practicing Catholic . &quot; But it ' s something you don ' t get_rid_of , and so I think_about all this in that context also . But for me , this is apart from religion or anything else . It ' s sort of like how I view things . &quot; Imagine someone who grew_up in a teeny , tiny town in southern Illinois who can actually find something abnormal in genes and develop a test for it . In some ways it ' s a little bit frightening , because you don ' t exactly know 10 years from now how the information will be used . &quot; But in the long_run , it does much more good than harm . Finding the defective gene is the first_step to preventing or curing the disease . I ' m not going_to quit what I do . It ' s too important , and I love doing it. &quot; John Jacob Wasmuth Age : 48 . Background : Born in Greenville , Ill. , now lives_in Mission Viejo . Family : Married 30 years to Judy Schwierjohn , with whom he has a 28-year-old daughter , Michele Bones of San Diego , and a grandson , Connor , 10 months . Passions : Mystery_stories , any sport and breaking genetic codes . On the simplicity of genetic testing : &quot; The test for achondroplasia ( a form of dwarfism ) can be done_by a high_school biology_lab with one piece of equipment and $ 100 worth of chemicals . Four reasonably intelligent high_school students could do 100 tests in a month . Tests aren ' t all that simple , but a lot of them are , and they ' re getting simpler all_the time. &quot; On the future of genetic repair : &quot; For the most part we ' re still playing with Tinkertoys , but for the last five or six years people have been able to stick genes into mouse embryos and correct genetic defects . If you can do_it in mice , you can do_it in people . It ' s just a matter of not being efficient enough at this time. &quot; On genetic discoveries : &quot; Once you get familiar_with the playing_field , with human genes , a lot is intuition . You see something , but it may_not hit you that day . Maybe two weeks later you ' re thinking , ' Something about that bothers me. ' But sometimes it ' s a genuine , all-out aha ! &quot;</TEXT>
