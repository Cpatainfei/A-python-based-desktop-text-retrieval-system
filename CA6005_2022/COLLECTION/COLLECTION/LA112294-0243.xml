   <HEADLINE> HOUSING , RELIGIOUS RIGHTS CLASH IN RENTAL DISPUTE ; LAWS : STATE HIGH_COURT TO REVIEW CHICO LANDLADY ' S REFUSAL TO RENT TO COUPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE UNMARRIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gail Randall and Ken Phillips fell_in_love with the Chico duplex . It had pale yellow clapboards trimmed in brick , a high , steep roof , hardwood floors and a fireplace . The tree-shaded home reminded Randall of a gingerbread house . But there was a hitch . The landlady , a conservative , devout Christian , refused to rent to unmarried couples . When she learned Randall and Phillips lived together outside of marriage , she canceled the rental agreement and mailed back their deposit . &quot; It was real disappointing , &quot; said Randall , 31 . The couple filed a complaint against the landlady , sparking a constitutional dilemma over the competing rights of religious freedom and fair housing , property and privacy , and , peripherally , over what constitutes sin . Backed by onetime presidential candidate and television evangelist Pat Robertson , the landlady maintains that her religious convictions entitle her to discriminate . She and a handful of other landlords around the nation have been prevailing in courts with the help of a legal aid group started by the conservative preacher . California Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren , the state ' s top law_enforcement officer , recently refused to continue representing a state fair housing agency against the Chico woman . Lungren said he supported a Court of Appeal ruling in her favor , forcing the state agency to obtain a private lawyer . The California Supreme Court agreed to review the dispute even though it had failed to reach a decision in a similar Southern California case . The justices , who rarely drop a case after voting to accept it , were believed to have been deeply torn . Now the case is considered the most important constitutional test on the issue because most other state high_courts have avoided ruling directly on the religious freedom issue . &quot; If it means the homosexuals and the fornicators can ' t find a place to live , &quot; said Evelyn Smith , 62 , the Chico landlady , &quot; well , I am sure there are enough sinners who would rent to them . I am not saying people should be homeless. &quot; The ruling , expected next year , could have widespread ramifications , allowing the deeply religious to discriminate against gays and heterosexual couples in housing , employment and other business transactions . About 500 # 000 unmarried couples live together in the state , and the majority of people who married in Los Angeles County in 1993 lived together previously . Discrimination on the basis of marital_status is barred by California ' s Fair Employment and Housing Act , which also prohibits discrimination by race , color , religion , sex , national origin , ancestry , disability and familial status . Landlords who rent rooms in their homes are exempt . About 11 % of the housing complaints lodged_in California in 1992-93 alleged discrimination because of marital_status . The bulk of the grievances came from renters who believed they were denied housing because of race or because they had children . Chico , nestled near the Sierra_Nevada foothills north of Sacramento , is an eclectic community best known as the home of Chico State , which Playboy magazine once christened the top party college in the nation . But the predominantly white , middle-income town also shares the conservatism of the rest of Butte County . Farmers tend almond and walnut orchards , and retirees from elsewhere in the state are attracted by Chico ' s mild winters , its two well-regarded hospitals and a relatively low cost_of_living . Smith , who raised her family in Chico , lives in a different neighborhood from her rental units . The widow said most prospective tenants go_away quietly if they do not like her rules on &quot; hanky-panky. &quot; She once explained her feelings to a gay_man who wanted to rent from her . &quot; He said , ' I respect you for that , ' &quot; and decided not to pursue the vacancy , she said . But Randall and Phillips were indignant . He was 28 at the time , she 24 . They had lived together for about three years after meeting in her hometown of Atascadero in San Luis Obispo County . She went_to school and worked with Phillips in his landscaping business . When Phillips called Smith about the vacancy seven years ago , she told him she preferred to rent to married_couples . &quot; That shouldn ' t be a problem , &quot; Phillips , now 35 , remembered replying at the time , and now says , &quot; which it shouldn ' t be . It was a bit of spin control on my part. &quot; Before meeting Smith later that day , the Chico landscaper called the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and was told that such discrimination was illegal . But the couple continued their pretense when they met Smith at the duplex , in a neighborhood where the couple had long wanted to live . She accepted a deposit , and the couple signed a rental agreement . Neither Randall nor Phillips wanted to continue the charade . Phillips called Smith later that day and told her the truth . She put their deposit in the mail and canceled the agreement . Randall , an aspiring nurse who goes_to school at night and works two jobs , said she was &quot; tired_of the issue coming up. &quot; She and her boyfriend had previously rented from a landlord who assumed they were married , and rather than risk losing their home , let him believe as he wished . She did not like the subterfuge . &quot; We didn ' t like being put_in the position of having to lie , &quot; she said , &quot; and we certainly did not want to keep_up the lie every month. &quot; Smith remembers the couple as &quot; absolutely thoughtless , careless young people. &quot; The mother of three grown children , Smith rents_out two duplexes to supplement the pension of her late husband , a mail_carrier . She wears a crucifix around her neck , has a Christian bumper sticker on her car and marches in an anti-abortion rally once a year . After the unmarried couple filed a complaint against Smith with the state housing commission , her friends put her on &quot; the prayer chain , &quot; so that many people would be asking God to send her an attorney . Jordan Lorence , who was representing a conservative Christian group at the time , took the case . He now is being paid by Pat Robertson ' s Virginia-based American Center for Law and Justice , which has represented landlords in similar cases . At a hearing of the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission , a representative of Smith ' s church , the Presbyterian_Church ( U.S.A. ) , testified that she would not be committing a sin if she rented to an unmarried couple . Smith is still riled about that . &quot; This man can ' t tell me how I am going_to get_to heaven , &quot; she said . A representative of the Orthodox Presbyterian_Church testified that the Bible supported her views . The judge ruled for the tenants and ordered Smith to pay them $ 900 and to post a notice on her units that she had unlawfully discriminated . The commission later reduced the fine to $ 454 . &quot; There is no way in the world I am ever going_to rent to fornicators , &quot; Smith said , and appealed the decision . The California Court of Appeal , ruling_in her favor , cited &quot; the state ' s interest in promoting the marriage relationship. &quot; Courts in Minnesota and Illinois also have sided with landlords , but unlike California , those states have laws that prohibit fornication . They cited those laws in their rulings . A Wisconsin court held that unmarried couples did not fall_under a local ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital_status . Massachusetts ' highest_court told the state it had to show compelling reasons for forcing a landlord to rent to someone in violation of his religious_beliefs . Bucking this trend , the Alaska Supreme Court ruled_in favor of the tenants in a dispute with a religious landlord . The U.S. Supreme Court on Oct . 31 declined to review the case , leaving Smith ' s as the pivotal test of the issue . Smith ' s lawyer noted that unmarried couples are treated differently from married_couples under the law . State colleges , he said , are exempt from the anti-discrimination regulation and can reserve housing for a single sex or for married_couples . &quot; So the state is prosecuting Mrs . Smith for what the state is doing &quot; in public colleges , Lorence complained . Beyond college , some men share lodgings with women without being romantically involved . Lorence confessed that he did not know how religious landlords would treat such couples , but he added the situation probably was rare . Marian Johnston , a private attorney who has been representing the state commission since Lungren withdrew , said people who do business in California must comply with the state ' s regulations . &quot; If she doesn ' t like the way the state tells her to run her business , &quot; Johnston said , &quot; she shouldn ' t be in the business. &quot; A victory for Smith would allow landlords and employers to use religion as an excuse to discriminate in all kinds of ways , she said . &quot; I am sure there are religious groups that don ' t believe_in interracial couples , &quot; she said . &quot; I would hate to think the state is required to accept discrimination against an interracial couple in the name of freedom of religion. &quot; Gays would be particularly affected by the court ' s ruling , said Los Angeles lawyer Thomas F . Coleman , who is representing Phillips . &quot; Some employers may_not want to employ homosexuals , &quot; he said . &quot; It is against the law , but they can use this theory that it is a sin in their mind. &quot; Smith said she told her husband on his deathbed eight years ago that she would try to join him in heaven . She fears she might not get there if she rents to sinners . &quot; I am not saying everybody who rents to fornicators is not going_to go_to heaven , &quot; she said . &quot; But my God won ' t let me do it. &quot; Randall and Phillips no longer live together , but remain friends . Like Smith , they plan to attend the California Supreme Court ' s oral arguments in the case , which have not yet been scheduled . Phillips said the episode with Smith upset him because he felt she was intruding_into the privacy of his sex life . But he did not think_of the rejection as discrimination until many months later , when he saw a television_program about landlords who refused to rent to African Americans . &quot; Being a white male , I don ' t think_of these things that often , &quot; he said . &quot; Usually I am not the victim of them -- usually. &quot;</TEXT>
