   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; LABOR WARS HIT_HOME IN DECATUR ; CAUGHT IN THE CROSS-FIRE OF THREE MAJOR DISPUTES , THE ILLINOIS PRAIRIE CITY IS AN UNWITTING SYMBOL , SOME SAY VICTIM , OF THE GLOBAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN BIG BUSINESS AND BIG UNIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On this city ' s northeast side , where strip shopping_centers give_way to smokestacks and cornfields , 22nd Street is the demarcation_line for a global battle on three fronts . It ' s where 4 # 000 workers -- 7 % of the local work_force -- have set_up picket_lines to protest their treatment by three multinational employers : one Japanese , one British and one American . On this 100th anniversary of Labor_Day , Decatur -- a farming and manufacturing center that calls itself the &quot; Pride of the Prairie &quot; -- stands as unwitting symbol , and some say victim , of the long and evolving struggle between big business and big labor . Workers are_on strike against Peoria-based Caterpillar Inc. and Japanese-owned Bridgestone / Firestone Inc. , while their soul_mates at A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co . -- a home-grown concern bought several years ago by the_British conglomerate Tate &amp; Lyle -- have been locked_out for 14 months . It ' s a triple jolt this central Illinois town of 90 # 000 people -- just now recovering from the ' 80s downsizing and the last recession -- doesn ' t need , and the international economic forces at_work have triggered some predictable xenophobia : Picket signs bash both the_British and the Japanese . The angry pickets and mass demonstrations may seem a throwback in an era of reputedly weak unionism . And the actual disputes today are less about wages than about workplace changes that corporations argue must be made to make Decatur ' s products competitive in today ' s tough global markets . But labor is making a stand_in Decatur . &quot; It ' s our solidarity against theirs , &quot; said Larry Solomon , president of United Auto Workers Local 751 , which struck Caterpillar in June . &quot; If we fall here , you will feel the waves to California and beyond. &quot; And although Decatur has a long labor history and a memory of bitter strikes , the current struggle is creating greater community discord than most residents can remember . &quot; There is a growing polarization , &quot; said Mayor Eric Brechnitz . &quot; This is an epic struggle in which both sides are dug_in and we are suffering as a result. &quot; The confluence of labor strife in Decatur is largely happenstance , local officials say . Two of the disputes are nationwide actions , and this happens to be the only U.S. city with both a Caterpillar and Bridgestone / Firestone plant . But labor experts say that what is unfolding in Decatur represents a microcosm of the bigger drama being played_out by labor and management on a global scale . &quot; It may be a coincidence you have three major strikes involving three multinational companies in the same town , &quot; said Michael LeRoy , labor professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . &quot; But there are synergies developing between these disputes. &quot; The overlapping labor actions have driven union solidarity to unusual lengths . The confluence of interests was displayed at a recent coalition meeting of about 25 members of the auto , rubber and paper workers union , as well as transportation and teachers union officials . Such meetings , rare in the past , are held weekly . There is talk_about media coverage . There is talk_about fund raising and helping families make ends meet . And there is talk_about court injunctions , demonstrations and political action . A UAW bargainer outlines a plan to change Decatur ' s form_of_government . He proposes a petition drive to replace the City_Council with aldermen , hoping it would be easier to elect officials from districts more sympathetic to labor . It ' s a collaboration instigated in part by Ray Rogers , a jeans-wearing , charismatic labor strategist from New York who is blamed by some local officials for the strident tone of the disputes . Hired by the Staley union local , he is a controversial figure in_labor circles . Some mainstream union leaders complain that Rogers uses labor disputes to push a social-reform agenda . But he has helped to galvanize workers here . &quot; We want the workers to understand that they have more tools in their arsenal , &quot; Rogers said . Staley When Tate &amp; Lyle acquired Staley in 1988 for $ 1.5 billion , the international sugar conglomerate was buying a Decatur institution . Augustus Eugene Staley , an evangelist and merchant , founded the company in 1906 to turn the corn produced by nearby farms into starch and syrup . The company ' s plant just northeast of downtown grew_into a huge industrial complex , a maze of 100 buildings spread_over 450 acres and connected by pipes and tanks that cook and process tons of corn a day . The paternalistic Staley was proud_of the work he provided Decatur and in 1929 built a monument to his success -- a 14-story headquarters made of Indiana limestone topped with a gold-crowned dome . It was dubbed the &quot; castle in the cornfields. &quot; Today , the castle is under siege . Members of the United Paperworkers International Union , Local 7837 , have been picketing since June , 1993 , when Staley ' s new owners locked them out . The labor dispute was touched_off the previous year when Staley proposed a radical new contract with major work-rule changes . The company wanted to implement rotating 12-hour shifts , cut health_care benefits and ultimately eliminate two-thirds of the 760-member work_force . While the Decatur facility is profitable , Staley officials said the changes were needed to make the plant as efficient as its other U.S. factories . &quot; We aren ' t asking_for anything that is not standard in the industry , &quot; said J . Patrick Mahon , Staley ' s executive_vice_president . &quot; This isn ' t about wages but about having a plant that is competitive. &quot; When the union balked , Staley unilaterally imposed its contract . The union retaliated with a &quot; work-to-rule &quot; strategy inside the plant , scrapping labor-management teamwork efforts and slowing production . In June , 1993 , the union held a one-day strike over alleged plant safety violations . A week later , the company locked the workers out , citing vandalism of equipment and products . Staley quickly hired about 300 temporary replacement workers . The plant has been operating with non-union workers and supervisors . The company says production , safety and quality are at all-time highs . The lockout has hit the union_members hard . The local provides them just $ 60 a week ; if they take another job or collect unemployment they get nothing . About 100 workers have left town or taken permanent jobs elsewhere . &quot; You can see the strain in people ' s faces , &quot; said Local 7837 President David Watts . &quot; There are lots of divorces . People are losing homes and cars. &quot; George Austin , 47 , was divorced and began drinking heavily in the wake of the strike . He occasionally mows lawns to make a_few dollars and collects food_stamps . &quot; This has been the worst year of my life , &quot; Austin said , sitting on the picket_line outside Staley ' s main entrance . &quot; I thought my job was rock solid . It ' s disheartening. &quot; Despite 60 meetings between the union and company since 1992 , there has been no progress in the talks . Caterpillar At the Caterpillar plant , about 1 # 800 workers walked_out in June when the United Auto Workers called the second nationwide strike in three years against the world ' s largest maker of earthmoving equipment . The new strike is a vestige of the previous one , an especially bitter five-month walkout in which the outcome was widely perceived as a big setback for the UAW and organized labor . Caterpillar insisted on a cheaper labor_agreement than the industry-standard pact signed at Deere &amp; Co . The strike ended when Caterpillar threatened to permanently replace the union_members with other workers . Since then , the UAW has filed about 100 charges of unfair labor practices against the company . Those charges became the basis for the new strike against 12 plants in three states . Caterpillar has continued to operate its plants with supervisors , some new hires and union_members who have crossed the picket_lines . But the Decatur plant has had fewer workers cross the line than any other Caterpillar plant . Congress failed to pass a bill this summer that would ban the use of permanent replacements , and the threat of being permanently replaced still hangs over the Caterpillar workers , most of whom are in their 40s and 50s . Caterpillar continues to advertise for new workers and is waging a major public relations campaign . One local television spot features a replacement worker who talks glowingly about the need for labor-management teamwork and global competitiveness . Caterpillar says its main competitor isn ' t Deere -- which has a much narrower product_line and is not a major exporter -- but Komatsu Ltd . Therefore , it must bring its costs in_line with foreign competitors like Komatsu , said Cat spokesman Terry Thorntenson . But the UAW ' s Solomon said : &quot; They are trying to make union a dirty word. &quot; Bridgestone / Firestone On the picket_line outside the Bridgestone / Firestone plant , members of United Rubber Workers Local 713 wave to passing drivers who honk their horns_in support . On July 12 , the URW struck five Bridgestone / Firestone facilities when the union refused to accept a contract that proposed significant changes in work rules and cutbacks in benefits . The URW has also struck facilities operated by Sumitomo Corp. , Yokohama Rubber Co . and Pirelli in the United States . But the strike against Bridgestone / Firestone , the world ' s leading tire producer , is the biggest and potentially most damaging . It comes against a company that has boasted of good labor-management relations . After it purchased Firestone in 1989 for $ 2.6 billion , relations were so good that the company didn ' t resist the URW ' s organization of two new plants . &quot; There is an irony here that a Japanese company world-renowned for model labor-management relations is involved in a hardball confrontational dispute with an American union , &quot; said Harley Shaiken , a visiting labor professor at UC Berkeley . The company ' s sudden aggressiveness is not lost on the striking workers . A sign posted outside the aging , red-brick factory reads : &quot; 1941 , Japan Attacks Pearl_Harbor ; July 12 , 1994 , Bridgestone / Firestone Attacks American Workers. &quot; As in the Caterpillar strike , a major issue is pattern bargaining , the establishment of similar labor_agreements across whole industries . The URW wanted Bridgestone / Firestone to sign a contract similar to one negotiated with Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co . But Bridgestone / Firestone claims that its U.S. plants are less efficient than its competitors ' and wants a contract to help it narrow the gap . &quot; A Goodyear-type settlement would severely damage our competitive position , &quot; said Charles Ramsey , Bridgestone / Firestone vice_president . But the union said the offer -- asking_for 12-hour rotating shifts , health_care co-payments , and reduced vacation time and overtime -- is unacceptable . &quot; There is no end to what they are trying to take_away , &quot; said URW Local 713 President Roger Gates , who represents 1 # 270 striking workers . For Decatur , the labor strife has been about as welcome as a prairie tornado . The area is just recovering from the devastation of the ' 80s , when recession and foreign competition racked the Rust Belt and Decatur lost a third of its factory jobs and nearly 10 % of its population . The trend has reversed itself in recent years as the city has attracted new light-manufacturing and high-tech industry . Still , the area ' s jobless rate stands at about 7.5 % , compared with less than 6 % for all_of Illinois . And city officials fear that the labor strife will curb business expansion and dissuade other companies from moving here . &quot; It ' s a negative which could impact our ability to attract new business to the community , &quot; said Richard Lutovsky , president of the Decatur Metro Chamber_of_Commerce . Merchants say the disputes -- carving a weekly payroll of up_to $ 3 million out of the economy -- have also begun to hurt businesses . &quot; Purchases of big-ticket items are being put_on hold , &quot; said Ed Markgraf , manager of the local Sears store . &quot; I ' m cutting_back inventory for the fall. &quot; Even the opening of the Decatur Celebration , an annual summer festival , was disrupted when striking workers repeatedly interrupted a speech by the mayor , a stockbroker whom union_members regard_as anti-union . Brechnitz also complains that the city ' s police_department has been stretched thin by the labor actions . While many residents are sympathetic to the workers , others are perplexed that they would risk jobs that pay $ 17 an hour , among the area ' s highest wages . &quot; Some wives don ' t understand why their husbands are out there , &quot; Markgraf said . The tensions are visible in the billboards and picket signs -- some planted in residential lawns -- placed throughout town . In mid-July , about 120 union workers , carrying U.S. flags and wearing red T-shirts , demonstrated in a staid , upper-middle-class neighborhood where many Staley executives live . A demonstration at Staley in early June resulted in the arrest of 47 union supporters , including a local minister . At another rally , police sprayed the crowd with pepper gas to maintain control . And there are more demonstrations to come . At last week ' s joint meeting of leaders from the three unions , they huddled with Rogers and George Lakey , an expert in civil_disobedience tactics . The union_members talked_of their concerns about being arrested in peaceful demonstrations . Local officials worry about what the unions may have up their sleeve for Labor_Day . The unions have said only that they plan to march en masse in red shirts down Main_Street to the statue of Abraham_Lincoln outside the county_courthouse . But given the militancy of recent demonstrations , uneasiness is understandable . &quot; There is a chemistry for disorder to get_out of hand here , &quot; said LeRoy .</TEXT>
