   <HEADLINE> TV PIONEER , ENTERTAINER DINAH SHORE DIES AT 76 ; SHOW_BUSINESS : FRIENDS REMEMBER WINNER OF 10 EMMYS , PEABODY AWARD FOR HER CHARM AND GRACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dinah Shore , the durable and phenomenally successful entertainer who moved gracefully from radio and recordings to television , cookbooks and her own celebrity golf tournament , capturing and keeping America ' s heart along the way , died Thursday in her Beverly Hills home . She was 76 . Miss Shore died of cancer , with her former husband , film_star George Montgomery , and their two grown children , Melissa Ann Hime and John David Montgomery , at her side , publicist Connie Stone said . Over the long span of her career , the golden-haired Southern belle garnered nine gold records , 10 Emmys -- more_than any other performer in television history -- and her most cherished award , a Peabody , which included the inscription , &quot; What TV needs , obviously , is about 100 Dinah Shores. &quot; In observance of her death , the Hollywood Chamber_of_Commerce placed flowers on one of Miss Shore ' s three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , awarded to her for outstanding achievement in radio , recording and television . &quot; We have lost one of the voices that defined an era for us , &quot; said Hollywood billionaire and former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis , who , with his wife , Barbara , was a friend of Miss Shore . &quot; In many ways Dinah Shore set an example for us all to follow , not least in the areas of charity and fund raising for the less fortunate . Dinah was a joy to be around , independent and humorous . We should not mourn her death but rather celebrate her life. &quot; Miss Shore reigned over television for four decades from its infancy in the 1950s until the 1990s with a succession of shows built around her husky , sentimental voice , Southern comedic charm , cooking talent and ability to cajole celebrities to join her for whatever they wanted to say or do . Her string of enviable successes on the small screen included the 15-minute musical program , &quot; The Dinah Shore Show , &quot; from 1951 to 1957 ; the Chevrolet-sponsored Sunday night hour , &quot; The Dinah Shore Show &quot; from 1957 to 1963 ; the 90-minute talk_show &quot; Dinah ! &quot; from 1974 to 1980 ; &quot; Dinah ' s Place &quot; from 1970 to 1974 ; &quot; Dinah and Friends &quot; from 1979 to 1984 , and from 1989 to 1991 , a half-hour talk_show on the Nashville Network , &quot; A Conversation With Dinah. &quot; Even Miss Shore was a little nervous when she expanded her original television_program from 15 minutes to an hourlong show on Sunday nights in which she sang &quot; See the USA in your Chevrolet &quot; and blew a huge kiss to TV viewers . But Times entertainment editor Cecil Smith called that 1957-58 season &quot; the year of Dinah Shore &quot; and said Miss Shore &quot; waltzed into the big color shows with the casual grace and warmth of a talented neighbor dropping_in from next door to sing a little and show_off some brilliant friends . &quot; And , &quot; Smith added , &quot; she won the nation ' s Sunday-night hearts. &quot; Miss Shore also won her Peabody , an Emmy , and the Sylvania Award , and was named Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year . Over the decades , she was amused by attempts to describe the character of her various shows and analyze their success . &quot; What we are is a ' Do ' show , &quot; she told The Times in 1972 when she was holding forth on &quot; Dinah ' s Place. &quot; &quot; Almost everyone who comes_on has something they want to do . Ethel Kennedy played the piano , Joanne Woodward did some beautiful needlepoint . Burt Lancaster did a perfect Italian spaghetti sauce. &quot; With a sports enthusiasm based in a childhood bout with polio , Miss Shore became the first woman to earn the Entertainer of the Year Award from the President ' s Council on Physical_Fitness and Sports . The 22nd annual Nabisco Dinah Shore Golf Tournament , one of the richest on the Ladies Professional_Golf Assn . tour , will be played in March at the Mission Hills Country_Club in Rancho Mirage . Jim Webb , deputy commissioner of the association , said Thursday that he was &quot; shocked . . . deeply saddened . . . . We ' ve lost a great friend and tremendous supporter of not only the LPGA but golf in_general . It is like losing one of your very best friends. &quot; Miss Shore , with her well-known penchant for humor , recalled for The Times in 1992 how reluctant she had been to involve herself in the tournament two decades earlier : &quot; The Colgate Co . was sponsoring my television_show , and I was a tennis_player . I didn ' t play golf . However , the powers that be decided they were going_to sponsor a golf tournament . I said make_it tennis ; I didn ' t want to look_like a dummy in two sports . . . . I took a crash course in golf. &quot; But in no time , even Miss Shore was describing herself as &quot; a real golf bum. &quot; The brown-eyed natural brunette who had been known for her honey-blond hair since 1942 was often on best-dressed lists and was known for her robust health , energy and verve that made her appear far younger than her actual years . She once described her formula for living as being able to &quot; forget everything that happened yesterday and live_in the present. &quot; Former President and Mrs . Ronald Reagan , friends with the singer for 40 years , called her &quot; a dynamic individual . . . talented , energetic ( with ) a sincere spark for life. &quot; &quot; Dinah was five-star in every way , &quot; said former President Gerald Ford , a neighbor of Miss Shore in Rancho Mirage . &quot; Betty and I have lost a very dear friend , one of the finest , most generous and thoughtful persons we have been privileged to know. &quot; Actor Burt Reynolds , who had a celebrated love_affair with Miss Shore in the early 1970s , said : &quot; Hollywood has lost its greatest and only real angel . Dinah is what God meant when he strived to make perfection . &quot; She was the sunshine in my life and millions and millions of others , &quot; Reynolds said . &quot; She is the only person I ever knew who had nothing bad to say about anyone. &quot; Jack Valenti , president of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , called Miss Shore &quot; the kindest and the gentlest and the most enduring of all_the talented folks in our world. &quot; &quot; It ' s going_to be hard to face tomorrow , &quot; he said , &quot; without Dinah. &quot; The multitalented Miss Shore , whose paintings have been exhibited at the California Museum of Science and Industry , was born Frances Rose Shore on March 1 , 1917 , in Winchester , Tenn . Stricken with polio when she was 18 months old , she credited the experience with giving her an inferiority_complex and for pushing her into sports and entertainment . &quot; That early experience made me shy and ambitious at_the_same_time , &quot; she said in 1972 . &quot; I wanted to run faster than anyone else , and jump higher . I knew I had to do something to prove myself . &quot; I wanted to act , &quot; she said , &quot; but there weren ' t any Tennessee Williamses around in those days and it wasn ' t easy for a girl with a Southern accent to get work . Luckily , I could sing. &quot; She started singing at Hume Fogg High_School in Nashville , Tenn. , giving_up voice lessons to become a cheerleader . Nevertheless , she was soon singing on Nashville radio_stations WSM and WLAC . After graduating from Vanderbilt University with a degree in sociology , Miss Shore sold her camera and radio to finance a two-week job hunt in New York . It didn ' t take that long . She auditioned for disc_jockey Martin Block at radio_station WNEW , singing &quot; Dinah. &quot; In a historic lapse of memory , Block announced that &quot; Dinah Shore &quot; had won the audition . Disliking her own given name , she carried that one to fame . Miss Shore worked as a fill-in singer at NBC radio on such shows as &quot; Chamber_Music Society of Lower Basin Street , &quot; and found steady work_on Eddie Cantor ' s show . By 1943 she had her own radio show , and was recording with such famous bandleaders as Xavier Cugat . She sold 1 million copies of &quot; Yes , My Darling Daughter , &quot; and that recording success was followed quickly by &quot; Blues in the Night , &quot; &quot; Shoo Fly Pie , &quot; and &quot; Doin ' What Comes Naturally. &quot; Other hits were &quot; Buttons and Bows , &quot; &quot; Dear Hearts and Gentle People , &quot; &quot; It ' s So Nice to Have a Man Around the House , &quot; and &quot; I ' ll Walk Alone. &quot; A favorite on radio and jukeboxes and with GIs as America went_to_war , Miss Shore eventually got her chance to act . She didn ' t like it . She was in such films as &quot; Thank Your Lucky Stars , &quot; in 1943 , &quot; Up in Arms , &quot; &quot; Follow the Boys , &quot; and &quot; Belle of the Yukon &quot; in 1944 , &quot; Make Mine Music &quot; and &quot; Till the Clouds Roll By &quot; in 1946 , &quot; Fun and Fancy Free &quot; in 1947 , &quot; and &quot; Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick &quot; in 1952 . &quot; I hated it , &quot; she said years later . &quot; Making ( movies ) was so boring . You sat around interminably . And I never thought I was photogenic . I thought I looked horrible on the Technicolor screen. &quot; She said the experience also terrified her , and that she was afraid people would learn that she didn ' t read music well . Miss Shore found the small screen far more to her liking . &quot; I don ' t know how to be afraid of that old red eye . It ' s one person to me , &quot; she told Associated Press in 1989 . &quot; I don ' t visualize large_numbers of people out there . I ' m comfortable with it. &quot; In 1941 , Miss Shore fell_in_love with Montgomery ' s image when she went_to see his film &quot; The Cowboy and the Blonde &quot; 15 times . Two years later , when she was playing the Hollywood Canteen , he attended the show and confessed that he was a fan of hers as well . They were married in Las Vegas Dec . 5 , 1943 , and after one of Hollywood ' s storybook marriages , were divorced May 9 , 1962 . &quot; In the end , &quot; she said , &quot; we just drifted apart. &quot; Miss Shore married Palm Springs contractor and tennis_player Maurice Fabian Smith on May 26 , 1963 , but that marriage lasted less than a year . She began her romantic liaison with Reynolds after he appeared on her television_show . An enthusiastic cook , Miss Shore wrote three best-selling cookbooks , &quot; Someone ' s in the Kitchen with Dinah &quot; in 1971 , &quot; The Dinah Shore Cookbook &quot; in 1983 and &quot; The Dinah Shore American Kitchen &quot; in 1990 . She continued to give concerts , often benefiting her favorite philanthropies -- the March of Dimes , Boys and Girls Clubs of America , and Junior Achievement , on whose national board she served . In recognition of her business acumen and wide popularity and experience in entertainment , Miss Shore was appointed to the board of directors of MGM / UA Entertainment Co . in 1985 -- one of the few women entertainers , including Mary Pickford and Grace Kelly , ever to serve on motion_picture boards . Although she broke important ground for women in entertainment and sports and by opening_up country_club memberships to single women , Miss Shore spoke out against &quot; women ' s liberation in the early 1970s . &quot; It ' s always been a man ' s world , &quot; she said in 1972 , &quot; and it probably always will be . I don ' t want to change that . All of my career , on radio , in recording_studios , in films and on television , men have made the decisions for me , and they ' ve usually been the right ones. &quot; Among the accolades of a lifetime before microphones were nine Gold Medal Photoplay Awards , the Downbeat Pop-Jazz Award , the Golden Globe , and frequent listing on Gallup Poll ' s 10 Most Admired Women in the World . In addition to her children , Miss Shore is survived by three grandchildren , Jennefer , Adam and Alexander . * APPRECIATION , In Calendar</TEXT>
