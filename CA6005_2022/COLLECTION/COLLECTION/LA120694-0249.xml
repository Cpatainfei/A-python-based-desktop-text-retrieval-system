   <HEADLINE> HIGH_COURT SHOWDOWN ON HOMELESS ISSUE NEARS ; SHELTER : STATE JUSTICES TO HEAR ARGUMENTS THURSDAY ON A SANTA ANA LAW THAT FORBIDS CAMPING ON PUBLIC_PROPERTY . THE DECISION IS LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT FOR CITIES ACROSS THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. attorney_general , a trio of retired state Supreme Court justices and some of the country ' s most prestigious constitutional law professors are throwing their weight behind the homeless here . But more_than 90 city attorneys from throughout California and several conservative legal foundations are standing behind the city of Santa Ana in a legal showdown scheduled for Thursday , when the state Supreme Court will begin its review of a city ordinance that prohibits camping or the storing of belongings on public_property . The law , which critics say effectively expels the homeless from Santa Ana , was enacted in 1992 but overturned by a state appellate_court that derided it as an unconstitutional &quot; punishment for poverty. &quot; Now , the attention of cities throughout California and the nation is riveted on the Santa Ana case , which legal_experts say could eventually prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to help resolve the issue of anti-homeless ordinances . &quot; There ' s no doubt that whether or not the regulations on the books in many cities will be allowed is going_to depend_on this case , and if this is allowed , there ' s no doubt that many cities are going_to adopt similar ones , &quot; said Erwin Chemerinsky , a constitutional law professor at the USC School_of_Law . Indeed , increasingly frustrated by growing homeless populations -- and the crime , public health hazards and eyesores that can accompany life on the street -- many cities have passed laws to push the homeless off public_property . Miami , Dallas , Baltimore , San Francisco and Seattle all have landed in the courts after adopting ordinances directed at the homeless in recent years . But homeless advocates say Santa Ana ' s case marks the first time the U.S._government has filed a brief on behalf of the homeless . And with the state ' s top court required to rule on the_matter within 90 days of Thursday ' s oral arguments , legal_experts say the opinion will be the first in the country from a court of this level on the constitutional questions raised by anti-camping laws . In addition , the breadth of the Santa Ana law -- which bans camping at all times on all public_property -- also lends significance to a ruling . Proponents of the law say the appellate decision overturning Santa Ana ' s ordinance tied cities ' hands in their efforts to govern and wrongly created a constitutional right to live_on public_property . &quot; If homeless people are given a constitutional right to camp , what does_it do to the quality_of_life in our cities ? What does_it do to our liability ? &quot; asked Santa Ana Assistant City Atty . Robert Wheeler , who will argue the city ' s case in front of the state ' s highest_court . Orange County Deputy Dist . Atty . E . Thomas Dunn Jr. , who also will ask the court to overturn the appellate ruling , said the city &quot; ought to have a right to keep ( public areas ) clean for the rest of us . There ' s no reason why there ought to be a Republic of the Homeless , like an abdication of a piece of territory to those who are above the law. &quot; But those arguing on behalf of the homeless say there are many ways cities can keep public areas clean , including passing less restrictive laws banning camping in parks or forbidding people to erect shelters or tents -- both laws already on Santa Ana ' s books . &quot; By making_it a crime to use sleeping bags and blankets in every public area of the city at a time when the city has a substantial population of people who have no place to house themselves , Santa Ana is essentially making_it a crime to be homeless in the city , &quot; said Harry Simon , an attorney with the Legal Aid Society of Orange County , who will argue the case for the homeless with two other attorneys . &quot; We ' re not claiming that the homeless are some sort of protected class . What we ' re saying is that this is a pretty transparent attempt to drive the homeless from the city , &quot; Simon said . If the court upholds the law , homeless advocates warn , cities will scramble to enact similar ordinances for fear of becoming the enclave into which other cities force their poor . Orange and Fullerton enacted similar laws after Santa Ana ' s but have not enforced them , under threat of litigation . Five other Southern Californian cities -- West Hollywood , Long_Beach , Santa Monica , Beverly Hills and Santa Barbara -- passed anti-homeless ordinances in the same 18-month period , said Maria Foscarinis , executive_director of the National Law Center_on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington . Advocates for the homeless contend that Santa Ana ' s law violates the state and federal constitutions by punishing people because of their &quot; status &quot; as homeless and restricts their right to travel . Defenders of the ordinance say it legally punishes the conduct of living in public places , not the status of being homeless , and that many people choose to sleep outside . The Santa Ana ordinance prohibits camping , use of camping equipment -- including sleeping bags or blankets -- or storage of any personal items on public_property . By the time the city adopted the sweeping ordinance in 1992 , hundreds of people had set_up camp in the Civic Center area , erecting tents and shelters . According to the city ' s own estimate , there are 3 # 000 homeless people in Santa Ana and only 330 shelter beds . Ninety California city attorneys endorsing Santa Ana ' s position joined a friend_of_the_court brief drafted by San Francisco Deputy City Atty . Michael E . Olsen . Several conservative legal groups also are siding with Santa Ana , including the Pacific Legal Foundation and Criminal Justice Legal Foundation , both based in Sacramento , and the Washington , D.C.-based American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities . &quot; If you accept the basic premise from the court of appeal , then where do you draw_the_line ? On a bad_weather night , I suppose you ' d have to make the argument that you have to open your public buildings to the homeless , &quot; said Anthony Caso of the Pacific Legal Foundation , which predominantly defends the rights of property_owners . &quot; Simply because an individual has a need , that ' s not converted into a right to be fulfilled at public expense. &quot; The stakes are high enough that the U.S._government argued in its 24-page brief , filed just last week , that the Santa Ana ordinance violates the 8th Amendment by &quot; criminalizing homeless_persons ' sleeping in public even when no shelter is available. &quot; The federal_government has &quot; a clear responsibility . . . to engender respect for the human dignity of the homeless , &quot; said the brief .</TEXT>
