   <TEXT> Eight days after suffering a concussion at New Orleans , quarterback Chris Miller still complains of headaches and &quot; isn ' t clear about everything. &quot; But Miller would n ' t rule himself out from starting Sunday against Denver , and Coach Chuck Knox on Monday would n ' t commit to starting Miller or Chris Chandler . Chandler appears to have the inside_track on the starting job , with Tommy Maddox backing him up . Chandler took most of the snaps in practice Monday . &quot; I would say right now that Chandler is the starter because he is getting all_the work , &quot; Knox said . &quot; I don ' t know what the situation would be Wednesday . Our doctors are monitoring Miller ' s progress , and we ' ll go from there. &quot; Miller plans to throw_in informal workouts today and return to practice Wednesday . &quot; I ' m sure I could play , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' ll be the doctor ' s call to see how I react to practice and putting a helmet on . I ' m just going day-to-day right now . I rode the exercise_bike hard and I just feel my equilibrium is a little out of whack. &quot; Miller got the concussion when he was tackled by New Orleans ' Ernest Dixon in the first_quarter . He didn ' t know he had a concussion and played the rest of the first_half , throwing a touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce . He complained of dizziness at halftime , and was replaced by Chandler at the start of the second_half . Miller said he doesn ' t remember any of the second_half of the game . A CAT scan and MRI exam showed no brain damage , but team doctors held Miller out of workouts during the bye week for precautionary reasons . &quot; With all_the stuff going_on , and the stories that have been talked_about , you become a little more leery of those types of things , &quot; Miller said . &quot; And I was kind of messed_up to begin with anyway . &quot; I ' ve got concerns . I get headaches all_the time , and I have a hard_time reading an article in the paper , it starts getting fuzzy . It should start clearing_up . Doctors say it sometimes takes a couple weeks and so hopefully , it will be sooner than that. &quot; Chicago running back Merril Hoge retired recently because of Post Concussion Syndrome , which also forced former Jets wide receiver Al Toon out of the game . Miller said he has had concussions four or five times in his career &quot; this is the one that has stuck_with me the longest. &quot; &quot; I got knocked unconscious for a brief period_of_time in college ( at Oregon ) , &quot; he said . &quot; This one has just been hard for me , to get my head clear . It has kind of stuck_with me. &quot; Because of two knee surgeries and a variety of other injuries , Miller has never played a full season in his eight-year NFL career . He has been sidelined this season with a sore abdominal muscle in the exhibition_season , and sore rib cartilage and shoulder injury in the regular season . He has completed 51.2 % of his passes with seven touchdowns and eight interceptions , and the Rams are 2-4 with him as their starter . Chandler ' s sprained left ankle still isn ' t 100 % , but he said he ' s approaching this week as though he ' s the starter . &quot; It ' s not exactly what I want , &quot; said Chandler , who injured his ankle Oct . 2 against Atlanta . &quot; I would need a lot of time_off to get_it perfect but I ' m playing with it and I ' m used to it. &quot; * Steve Novak , general counsel with the Rams the last six seasons , will leave the team at the end of the week to become counsel for Fox Network . . . . Right tackle Darryl Ashmore , who returned last week from a knee injury , worked_at right guard , backing_up starter Leo Goeas . Rookie Wayne Gandy continued to work with the first-string at right tackle , with veteran Jackie Slater , back from a torn triceps muscle , as the backup . Slater ' s return allowed Ashmore to move to guard , where the Rams have no depth behind starters Goeas and Chuck Belin . Ashmore , who was involved in a fight during training camp , helped break one up Monday between defensive tackle D ' Marco Farr and practice squad player Brad Fichtel . . . . Wide receiver Richard Buchanan re-pulled a hamstring muscle during punt protection drills . Defensive end Robert Young ( knee ) expects to return to practice Wednesday . Linebacker Shane Conlan ( pinched nerve ) also missed Monday ' s practice but expects to be ready later in the week . MIKE REILLEY</TEXT>
