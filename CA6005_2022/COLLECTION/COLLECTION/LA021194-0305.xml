   <HEADLINE> FASHION ; SUPPORT FOR MOMS ; SPECIALTY BRAS FOR PREGNANT AND NURSING WOMEN HAVE PROLIFERATED . BUT GETTING THE RIGHT FIT IS STILL TRICKY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Agood friend who recently delivered a nine-pound baby had shaken her head in disbelief early in her pregnancy . &quot; It would n ' t surprise me if the same company that made maternity underwear also made trash bags , &quot; she said , holding_up a nursing bra . A few months later , it fit perfectly . So it goes when you ' re trying to decide what to buy_in the way of &quot; foundations &quot; -- nursing bras and other specialty garments -- to get you through pregnancy and beyond . &quot; Hormonal changes cause most women to begin changing bra sizes within the first few months ( of pregnancy ) , &quot; said Patty Villarreal , a registered nurse and director of the South Texas Lactation Center in San Antonio . &quot; Not only will the cup size increase , but a pregnant woman ' s chest wall expands , changing both ( letter and number ) measurements , &quot; she added . The options for pregnant and nursing women have proliferated in recent years , said Liz Wallace of A Pea in a Pod , a national chain of maternity stores . Prenatal and nursing bras now come_in a wide variety of styles , including front closure and underwire , as well as versions for jogging and sleeping . But &quot; a bra need not be labeled ' prenatal ' &quot; to be practical , said Carol Anne Friedman , a lactation consultant and owner of Mothers With Style , a Glendale maternity shop . &quot; Any good-fitting , supportive and comfortable bra will work as a prenatal bra. &quot; But Friedman endorses nothing but 100 % cotton . &quot; Frilly nylon bras aren ' t functional , &quot; she said . &quot; When you ' re nursing a baby , you want comfort and functionality. &quot; Villarreal agrees . She also suggests that moms-to-be put_off shopping for a nursing bra until the last trimester so the bra can be worn before and after the baby arrives . &quot; Women should opt_for a fabric that allows the skin to breathe and a fit that leaves room for growth -- and nursing pads , &quot; she said . Wallace measures clients around the bust line and the chest , then uses a conversion chart to determine cup size . &quot; If the bra fits you perfectly , it ' s the wrong bra , &quot; she explained . &quot; It should be loose through the nipple going_up to the bust line . This will accommodate for milk and pads. &quot; Villarreal cautions against choosing underwire styles for postpartum wear because they may impede circulation . She added that you should be able to unhook the breast flap with one hand . &quot; ' Practice unhooking the cup while in the dressing room , &quot; she said . The experts also emphasize the importance of wearing a bra day and night . &quot; Many women find they cannot go without one , &quot; Wallace said , adding that sleeping bras in lightweight , breathable cotton offer comfort and support . Nursing moms who go without will probably regret it , Villarreal said . &quot; The long-term effect is the stretching of muscles that support breast tissue. &quot;</TEXT>
