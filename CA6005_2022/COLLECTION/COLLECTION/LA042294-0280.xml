   <HEADLINE> PARENTING ; OUT OF HARM ' S WAY ; * HOME SAFETY DEVICES HELP PROTECT ADVENTUROUS CHILDREN . BUT THERE ' S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A WATCHFUL ADULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thirty seconds . That was all it took_for Mark Zeolla of Calabasas to get Popsicles from the garage freezer for 3-year-old Christina and 13-month-old Ciara . Thirty seconds was all it took_for Ciara to drink from the oil-filled lamp on the living room table . When Zeolla returned , Ciara was gasping for breath . A year later , she ' s fine . But , Zeolla remembered , &quot; it was traumatic seeing my daughter almost die in my arms. &quot; He and his wife , Cindy , consider themselves safety-conscious . They had installed a gate at the entrance to the living room . But on the day of the accident , the gate was inadvertently left unlatched . &quot; Child-proofing can give a false sense of security , &quot; said Daryl Gregory of Mr. Baby Proofer , a Van Nuys safety device installation service . &quot; The key to protecting your child is supervision. &quot; While safety gadgets are no substitute for a parent ' s watchful presence , they do cut_down on the potential for disaster . For a curious child exploring the world , the potential is considerable . The National Safety Council reports that in 1991 about 2 million injuries and in 1992 more_than 2 # 000 deaths of children under 5 years were_due to home accidents . And the dangers arise early . Child-proofing should begin before a baby can crawl -- usually when the child is 6 months old . At that point , it ' s wise for parents to inspect rooms thoroughly from the little one ' s perspective -- on_hands and knees -- to eliminate potential booby_traps . Experts in the field single_out the following devices and products , which address the most common hazards around the home : * Cabinet , drawer , garbage pail and appliance latches keep sharp utensils , cleaning solutions and other dangers inaccessible to small explorers . * Plug inserts for unused outlets , outlet shields , wire covers , lamp cord shorteners and VCR guards reduce electrical accidents . * Window_shade / blind cord shorteners help avert strangulation accidents . * Window_locks / guards keep children from falling_out . * Security gates block_off stairways and rooms . * A locked fence around the pool is a must . Children require constant supervision around water , and safety advocates caution against reliance on flotation_devices or bath support rings for security . * Toilet locks , which prevent children from falling_into the bowl , can protect against drowning . * Rubber mats , non-skid appliques and cushion covers_for faucets and spouts add_to bathtub safety . Anti-scald devices offer extra protection . * Table-edge cushions and corner bumpers prevent injuries , as do interlocking mats on hardwood floors and wall braces for heavy furniture . * A choke tester is a handy device when older siblings play with small toys . If a toy fits entirely within the tube , it ' s a hazard to babies . * Stove-knob covers and range guards protect youngsters against burns . Even more important , advised Keith Noren , co-owner of Safer-Baby , a retailer of safety products in Studio City , adults should &quot; discourage play in the kitchen and bathroom. &quot; Gregory suggests creating a safe room where a supervised child can explore without risk . &quot; But there are rooms that should be off-limits , including the office and exercise rooms , &quot; he said . * Door locks and knob covers keep young ones from entering forbidden rooms or wandering away from home . Safety devices are available at Safer-Baby , Toys R Us , baby furniture stores , home-improvement stores and self-service stores , such_as Target . They can also be ordered from catalogues , among them Perfectly Safe ( 1-800-837-KIDS ) and The Safety_Zone ( 1-800-999-3030 ) . Noren and Gregory agree that products made outside the United States aren ' t as durable as some domestic offerings . Brands they recommend include First Years , Gerber , Kinderguard , Playskool , Mericon and Totlock . Above all , say experts , parents should be aware of_their_own habits and example . It ' s inadvisable , for instance , to take medicine in front of copy-cat kids , or leave plastic dry-cleaning bags around . If responsible parents inoculate their children against disease , they might consider child-proofing as just another way to ensure that a youngster grows_into a healthy adult .
