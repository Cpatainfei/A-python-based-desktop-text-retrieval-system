   <TEXT> A nuclear_reaction will reach a self-sustaining level next Tuesday in Japan ' s controversial &quot; fast-breeder &quot; nuclear_reactor , officials said Friday . The fast-breeder reactor uses highly toxic plutonium as a base substance to generate electric_power . Other industrialized nations have dropped plans for fast-breeders because of the hazards associated with plutonium , leaving Japan as the only country actively pursuing the technology as an energy source . The plant , located in Tsuruga , 200 miles west of Tokyo , is named Monju , after the Buddhist deity of wisdom , and has a capacity of 280 megawatts . A group of anti-nuclear activists on Tuesday submitted a petition demanding closure of the reactor . But officials lauded the start-up of the $ 5.9-billion Monju as a great benefit to an energy-dependent nation .</TEXT>
