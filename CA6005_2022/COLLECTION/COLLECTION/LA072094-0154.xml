   <HEADLINE> UKRAINIAN LEADER TAKES OATH , VOWS RUSSIA TIES ; POLITICS : LEONID KUCHMA , THE NATION ' S NEW , MOSCOW-LEANING PRESIDENT , ALSO CALLS FOR CHANGES TO AVERT ECONOMIC DISASTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With one hand on a 16th-Century Bible and the other on Ukraine ' s 1991 Declaration_of_Independence , Leonid Kuchma was sworn_in Tuesday as this nation ' s second president . It was the first peaceful transfer of executive power in Ukraine ' s turbulent modern history . But even as he took_over from outgoing rival Leonid Kravchuk , Kuchma called_for &quot; essential changes in Ukraine ' s economic and political course &quot; to avert economic disaster . In a short inaugural_address , Kuchma , 55 , vowed to reform the country ' s devastated economy , cut taxes , fight crime , liberalize foreign-exchange controls and sign a comprehensive treaty for closer economic ties with Russia . In an interview on Russian television Sunday , Kuchma suggested that the way to renew those ties is through the creation of Ukrainian-Russian corporations for the production of weapons , space launchers and other high-tech equipment . Kuchma ' s pro-Russian tilt appears to have placated Russian-speaking separatists in the Crimea , where Kuchma won almost 90 % of the vote_in the July 10 elections . In a symbolic move that would have been unlikely had Kravchuk won , Crimean President Yuri Meshkov joined other regional leaders in the marble-walled chamber of Parliament to watch Kuchma swear &quot; to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine. &quot; &quot; A normal man has come_to power , and the political climate has improved , &quot; Meshkov said after the ceremony . &quot; We won ' t be so tough in our positions now. &quot; Kuchma differs from his predecessor in his approach to ridding Ukraine of the 176 strategic nuclear missiles left on its territory when the Soviet_Union collapsed . He took a significantly less strident position in the Russian television interview than he had previously , saying , &quot; The sooner we get_rid_of these missiles , the better for Ukraine. &quot; But on previous occasions he has opposed signing the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty until it is amended to accommodate Ukraine ' s &quot; inheritance &quot; of nuclear_weapons . &quot; The treaty is up for renewal next year , &quot; Kuchma said at a post-election news_conference with a shrug that suggested Ukraine might wait until then before signing . Kuchma promised Tuesday that one of his first acts_as president will be to propose legislation giving the Russian language official status alongside Ukrainian . The pledge drew cheers from some lawmakers but is likely to raise nationalist hackles . As a peasant boy , Kuchma grew_up speaking Ukrainian but spent decades in the exclusively Russian-speaking world of Soviet aerospace , eventually rising to head Ukraine ' s largest missile factory . He took a_few lessons to polish his rusty Ukrainian before the presidential campaign began . Kuchma ' s most daunting task will be to revive an economy in shambles . Kuchma estimates that four in 10 Ukrainians are unemployed . Official statistics released Monday show a 40 % drop_in production in the first six months of this year , and output of some consumer goods has plunged 80 % . &quot; The economy ' s reserves left over from the Soviet_Union are totally exhausted , &quot; Oleg Soskin , the deputy head of a Kiev think_tank , told Reuters news service . &quot; Kuchma has no more_than two months to get his reforms going. &quot;</TEXT>
