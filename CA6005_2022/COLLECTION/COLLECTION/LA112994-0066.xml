   <HEADLINE> HOW DO YOU SAY ' BOFFO ' IN CHINESE ? ' THE FUGITIVE ' ; MOVIES : THE FIRST RECENT HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER TO BE SHOWN IN CHINA IN YEARS HAS GIVEN A BOOST TO THE COUNTRY ' S FALTERING MOVIE_THEATERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the central Chinese city Chongqing , the movie_theater manager said that audiences love the scene when Harrison Ford , cornered by Tommy Lee Jones , jumps several hundred feet into a roaring river . &quot; Some people have even come_back to see the film three , four or five times , &quot; said Fu Diaqi . In Shanghai , Zhang Yongliang , manager of the Guotai Cinema , said that viewers were thrilled by the film ' s sound_effects and &quot; strong sensory stimulation. &quot; Reports from other cities were the same . For the first time in 40-plus years , a recently produced American movie , Warner Bros. ' &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; is being shown in Chinese theaters in_general release . Except for a minor glitch here in the capital city , where the film became ensnared in a political rivalry and was pulled after only one week ' s release , &quot; The Fugitive &quot; is a runaway hit . &quot; A great success in major Chinese cities , &quot; reported the official New China News_Agency . In Shanghai alone , according to Li Guoxing , manager of the Shanghai Film Distribution Co. , more_than 700 # 000 people are expected to see the film in 36 theaters where it is showing this month . Scalpers outside the packed theaters , Li said , were getting double the $ 1.25 ticket price . All of this is good news to Warners , which took a significantly smaller-than-usual cut of the proceeds to be the first major studio to bring one of its recent releases into China . Until now , the foreign movie fare here has consisted_of decades-old American films such_as &quot; Spartacus &quot; and &quot; Love_Story , &quot; limited releases of U.S. films as well as extremely popular Hong Kong comedies and martial_arts action movies . American movie executives see this breakthrough as an important opening to the world ' s biggest potential entertainment market : China ' s population of 1.2 billion . The opportunity came earlier this year when the Ministry of Radio , Film and Television revised its longstanding limitations on foreign imports and agreed to allow &quot; the 10 best foreign movies &quot; into China each year . Promoted as a cultural opening , it is more like a desperate cry_for help to Hollywood from the beleaguered Chinese cinema industry . The traditionally conservative ministry changed the rules_in response to the steep decline in_attendance at Chinese movie_theaters . According to the New China News_Agency , cinema ticket sales dropped to just 9.5 billion in 1993 from 23.9 billion in 1979 . The overseas successes of famous Chinese film directors such_as Chen Kaige , whose &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; won international acclaim , have no meaning here . Most of their films are banned in China for political reasons and are not popular_with mass audiences who , like audiences everywhere , generally prefer action movies laden with special_effects . Rather , the decline in movie attendance is directly linked to the explosion of alternative public entertainment -- television , karaoke , video rental and private video showing rooms -- that has changed the face of China in recent years . The pace of the development of the new entertainment_industry is staggering . Only 15 years ago , there was just one &quot; cabaret &quot; in China , at the Dongfang Hotel in Guangzhou . Today , according to the People ' s Daily newspaper , there are hundreds of cabarets as well as at least 200 # 000 karaoke bars and 60 # 000 &quot; video viewing rooms &quot; -- private rooms that can be rented to watch movies on videocassettes and laser discs . With so many choices available today , China ' s filmgoing legions quickly abandoned the dreary menu of propaganda films produced by state-run studios . The thriving rental market in pirated videos only hastened the decline in the Chinese industry . Piracy is so widespread here that U.S. film executives touring a laser-disc factory in southern China discovered a unit manufacturing laser discs of Disney ' s &quot; The Lion King &quot; even before the video has been released in the United States . Despite the competition from other sources , however , the arrival of a recent American film this month was enough to perk_up business in theaters in the six Chinese cities where &quot; The Fugitive &quot; was shown . &quot; In our cinema , &quot; said Li Yangeng , manager of the Da Guangming Cinema in Shanghai , &quot; we have 1 # 554 seats and showed the film four or five times a day for eight days . More_than 50 # 000 people saw the film here . Most people said they hadn ' t seen a film like this for a long , long_time . They enjoyed every minute. &quot; But not everything went perfectly . Here in Beijing , two rival film distribution units got_into a row over the rights to proceeds from &quot; The Fugitive. &quot; According to sources , representatives on the losing faction , the Beijing Film Distribution Co. , took the_matter to the Central Propaganda Department , claiming that the film violated Chinese political mores . Reportedly , the losers told propaganda officials that showing the film was the equivalent of &quot; using socialist money to fatten the capitalist pig. &quot; The propaganda ministry dutifully canceled the film midway in its scheduled two-week run . There were also a_few other signs of alte politik still present in the land . On Nov . 21 , China ' s culture ministry ordered nightclubs and karaoke bars to buy patriotic laser discs containing 55 patriotic songs . Meanwhile , the nine other foreign films in the &quot; Best 10 &quot; import group are undergoing censorship review . The next release is expected to be &quot; Drunken Master , &quot; a first-run martial_arts movie released by Golden Harvest Co . of Hong Kong . But more Hollywood films are in the offing . Now that the door to foreign films has been opened , it is unlikely that it will be closed , particularly given the enthusiastic response to &quot; The Fugitive. &quot; Despite the long hiatus and hassles with the Communist regime , Hollywood will find it already has a loyal audience to its products , thanks to the thriving pirate video market in China . Several people attending the &quot; The Fugitive &quot; said during its abbreviated run in Beijing that they had come because they were already familiar_with Harrison Ford ' s work in the &quot; Indiana Jones &quot; series . A young couple standing in the ticket_line at Beijing ' s Dizhi Li Tang Theater revealed the sophistication that many younger Chinese already have about American movies , thanks to the pirated versions that cost only 40 cents to rent . Said Zhang Dong , 21 , a college_student : &quot; I like American movies , especially action films , because they are_better made . Their quality is generally better than the Hong Kong movies. &quot; But his girlfriend , Wang Ling , also 21 , disagreed : &quot; American films are too violent , bloody and horrible. &quot;</TEXT>
