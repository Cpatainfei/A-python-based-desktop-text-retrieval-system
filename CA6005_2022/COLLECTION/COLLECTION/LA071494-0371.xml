   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; IN EARLIER ERA , CLINTON TRIP WOULD HAVE BEEN TRIUMPH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In different times , President Clinton ' s just completed eight-day trip through Europe would have been a sure-fire triumph . As the leader of the globe ' s lone remaining superpower , the youthful President chose four countries that must be among the most pro-American anywhere -- Poland , Germany , Italy and the tiny Baltic_state of Latvia . He had spectacular backdrops -- the Warsaw Ghetto memorial , the 17th-Century Palazzo Reale in Naples , Berlin ' s history-laden Brandenburg Gate -- and warm , sunny weather to accentuate them . But as the President completed his third trip to Europe this year , he left_behind him few concrete results and a set of mixed emotions that fell far short of euphoria . &quot; It was a fantastic act of goodwill , but he committed himself to very little , &quot; said Michael Stuermer , director of the Ebenhausen Institute , a German government-financed think_tank near Munich , commenting on the German leg of the trip . Clinton ' s pledge of $ 200 million in new U.S. aid to Poland , made in Warsaw , was more a gesture of solidarity than meaningful assistance ; his decision to duck the dollar crisis completely at the Group of Seven economic summit in Naples diminished his credentials as presiding over the fastest-growing economy of the world ' s seven leading industrial nations . But the failure to ignite much genuine emotion on his visit had little to do with the President himself . Indeed , Europe ' s polite but uninspiring response to Clinton had far more to do with factors beyond his control -- such_as the Continent ' s preoccupation with internal problems , the fall from grace of almost an entire political class and transatlantic ties that have irrevocably changed with the Cold_War ' s end . For better or worse , Clinton is the first President since World_War_II who is not the guarantor of Western Europe ' s freedom and prosperity . And this change has altered the view toward him at virtually every level of European society . At the grass roots , this shift in thinking was nowhere more visible than during Clinton ' s visit Tuesday to Berlin and his speech in the shadow of Brandenburg Gate , barely a_few yards from where the city was divided during much of the Cold_War . Three decades ago , when President John F . Kennedy traveled_to West_Berlin and uttered his famous &quot; Ich bin ein Berliner &quot; message of solidarity to the beleaguered city , his words fell on a_people who knew that their very existence depended_on him . The majority of those West_Berliners had experienced both the horrors of war and the benefits of the massive American aid delivered under the Marshall Plan . While a number of old-timers showed_up to hear Clinton on Tuesday , the President ' s appearance had more the feel of a pep_rally than a serious political event , many analysts observed . Numbers also tell the difference . According to Berlin city archives , about 400 # 000 people crowded into the square in front of the West_Berlin City_Hall to hear Kennedy ; estimates of those who showed_up for Clinton ranged from one-quarter to one-tenth of that . Observers believe the President also suffered from the diminished standing of politicians , in_general , on a continent mired in a seemingly endless series of political scandals and other controversies . The approval rating of Polish President Lech Walesa hovers around 5 % , much of the Italian political Establishment has been swept_away by charges of wrongdoing and Chancellor Helmut Kohl was booed as he rose to speak in Berlin . Because most of Clinton ' s major foreign_policy problems have come outside of Europe , he faced little overt ill_will directed at him personally . &quot; There ' s a kind of skepticism and disillusionment of how leaders everywhere are performing , &quot; said Jack Spence of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London . &quot; I didn ' t detect any great increase in warmth for him. &quot; Still , there were some self-inflicted wounds along the way . In Naples , Clinton ' s plan to push immediately for a new round of global trade liberalization in areas such_as financial services and intellectual property_rights was immediately shot down by most other G-7 leaders as a threat to the most recent world trade agreement , which still faces ratification fights in several countries . Clinton ' s staff had promoted the plan as a test of the President ' s leadership . The President ' s unrestrained endorsement Tuesday of Germany as America ' s partner in leadership also visibly unsettled Germans , who were quick to stress they wanted to lead no one . &quot; Partners in responsibility , &quot; stressed Kohl in his remarks . Minutes after Clinton finished speaking , former German President Richard von Weizsaecker was emphatically telling a British Broadcasting Corp . reporter that Germany had no wish to act_on its own with America , wanting instead to work together with all its allies . Germany ' s neighbors , however , seemed far more relaxed at the President ' s remarks . &quot; Clinton acknowledged that Germany is the most powerful country in Europe , &quot; noted Belgian Foreign Ministry spokesman Patrick Renault . &quot; that ' s neither good nor bad . It ' s a simple fact. &quot;</TEXT>
