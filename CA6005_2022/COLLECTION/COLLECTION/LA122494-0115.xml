   <HEADLINE> LEBANON RAIDS MARK UPSURGE IN FIGHTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli warplanes rocketed guerrilla positions in South Lebanon on Friday after Muslim militants killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded seven in attacks on Israeli outposts , the army confirmed . The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah said it shelled the Israeli army positions in revenge for a car bombing that killed four people -- including at least two Hezbollah members -- in Beirut on Wednesday . Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for the car bombing , but Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin denied that Israel was involved . The upsurge in fighting on Israel ' s only active front came as talks continued in Washington between senior Israeli and Syrian military_officers , who were said to be exchanging views on the security needs each nation has_on the Golan Heights . Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have bogged down over Syria ' s demand that the Israelis withdraw completely from the strategic plateau , which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War . Syria has 30 # 000 troops deployed in eastern Lebanon , and Israel regards it as the chief powerbroker in that troubled nation . Israel has repeatedly accused Syria of using Hezbollah to put pressure on Israel at the negotiating table . Hezbollah recently stepped_up both shelling and ground_attacks on posts held by Israel and its allied militia , the South Lebanese Army , in Israel ' s self-proclaimed security zone -- a belt of land above Israel ' s border with Lebanon that the Israelis and the SLA jointly patrol . Twenty-one Israeli soldiers have died this year in South Lebanon . This month alone , six Israeli soldiers have died in South Lebanon and 18 have been wounded . The mounting casualties there have provoked a debate within the government and the Knesset , the Israeli Parliament , over whether the army should break_out of the security zone and unleash an all-out assault on Hezbollah . Rabin has warned that a large-scale attack could endanger the fragile negotiations with Syria under U.S. auspices or trigger Hezbollah attacks on Jews living outside Israel . Touring the northern border to speak with soldiers and their officers Friday night , Rabin again indicated that Israel ' s response to Hezbollah would be limited . &quot; We have to remember that we ' ve tried in the past to eliminate terrorism by means of a total war , &quot; Rabin said , referring to the June , 1982 , invasion of Lebanon launched by Israeli Prime_Minister Menachem Begin ' s right-wing government , an invasion that took the Israeli army all_the way to Beirut in a war against the Palestine Liberation Organization . &quot; We managed to eliminate the Palestinian terrorism in Lebanon , and instead we got a much more vicious , harsher terrorism and one that is for the most part authentically Lebanese , not foreign , &quot; Rabin said . He said the Israeli army ' s response to Hezbollah attacks in the security zone will , in_general , be confined to that area . &quot; Any attempt to . . . expand the security zone will force us to commit more forces , to allow them greater geographic mobility , and the number of casualties will rise without changing anything for ( the security of ) residents of the north , &quot; Rabin said . Nonetheless , Israeli planes and helicopter gunships attacked Hezbollah targets north of the security zone Friday after Hezbollah ' s morning attack on the Israeli positions . Reports from Marjayoun , in Lebanon , said that a Lebanese police_car was struck by one rocket outside the village of Jbaa , burning alive two Lebanese policemen . The army made no comment on that report . Hezbollah leaders had warned Thursday that the Shiite Muslim group would strike back at Israel for the Wednesday car bombing . Early Friday morning , Hezbollah started shelling Israeli positions in the eastern part of the security zone . Israel Radio reported that dozens of rockets , missiles and mortars fell on its posts at Suweida and Dabsheh . All the Israeli casualties reportedly occurred during an attack on a post at Ali Taher heights , an army spokesman reported . About 1 # 000 Israeli soldiers and about 2 # 500 SLA troops patrol the 440-square-mile zone , which Israel carved out_in 1985 to protect its northern towns from rocket attacks and cross-border guerrilla raids .</TEXT>
