   <TEXT> In 1986 , John G . Thomas volunteered for the first Santa Barbara Film Festival , a relatively modest four-day affair that met with some success . On Friday , eight years later , his film &quot; Healer &quot; opens the ninth annual festival , a 100-film , 10-day event with nine world_premieres expected to attract 25 # 000 people . Thomas , for one , couldn ' t be happier . &quot; Being the opening_night is a wonderful thing for us , &quot; said the 46-year-old director , who hopes to get his film , which examines themes of_aging through the eyes of two paramedics , picked_up for distribution . &quot; Hollywood comes_up there ( and ) the Santa Barbara Festival is very important because of it. &quot; This year ' s program will include sections titled &quot; Australian Horizons , &quot; &quot; Best of the_British , &quot; &quot; Contemporary Chinese Cinema , &quot; &quot; El Cine en Espanol , &quot; &quot; Made in Canada &quot; and &quot; U.S. Independents , &quot; as well as categories for world cinema , documentaries and shorts . To close the festival on March 13 , festival artistic director Phyllis de Picciotto chose Gramercy ' s &quot; Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould , &quot; a Canadian film consisting_of 32 vignettes about the iconoclast pianist that won four Canadian Genie Awards . Other highlights of the festival include world_premieres for : &quot; . . . and the earth did not swallow him , &quot; a film about the experiences of Chicano migrant workers based on the book by Tomas Rivera ; &quot; Chuppa : The Wedding Canopy , &quot; a film about Holocaust survivors who finally have a Jewish wedding ; &quot; Latin Legends , &quot; a documentary about Latino professional boxers featuring Edward James Olmos ; and &quot; Living With . . . , &quot; a documentary about a Santa Barbara home for people with AIDS . The festival will also pay special homage to actress Alfre Woodard and early screen star Buddy Rogers . &quot; It ' s become relatively easy to look good , &quot; said de Picciotto . &quot; I look_for honesty , I look_for fun , I look_for entertainment , I look_for a fresh perspective. &quot; She ' s especially excited about &quot; . . . and the earth did not swallow him &quot; and &quot; Latin Legends , &quot; two &quot; landmark films of Hispanic content. &quot; Canadian filmmaker Aaron Kim Johnston is giving his film , &quot; For the Moment , &quot; its U.S. premiere at the festival . He first came_to Santa Barbara in 1991 , looking_for distribution for his film &quot; The Last Winter. &quot; He didn ' t find it , but he ' s coming_back in March to look_for distribution for his new film , which tells the story of a World_War_II romance in Canada between an Australian pilot and a young Manitoba woman . He also finds Santa Barbara to be &quot; an acid_test for American sensibilities. &quot; Of course , the main goal of the city is to attract tourists . Besides locals , the festival attracts a mix of California weekenders , Los Angeles industry types and vacationers looking_to take_advantage of the festival and Santa Barbara ' s weather and beaches . The city promotes the festival as the ideal winter getaway , and even filmmakers aren ' t immune to the appeal . Johnston added that , &quot; when you live_in Winnipeg , Santa Barbara is a very attractive place to go_in March. &quot; * For a complete screening schedule or more information , call the film festival hot_line : ( 805 ) 689-INFO . Festival headquarters will be at the Graphics Gallery , at 1220 State St. , Santa Barbara , and will be open 1 to 6 p.m. daily during the festival .</TEXT>
