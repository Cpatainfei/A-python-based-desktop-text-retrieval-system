   <HEADLINE> DOCTORS : SENNA DIDN ' T DIE AT SCENE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Doctors who treated Ayrton Senna after he crashed during the San Marino Grand Prix have denied allegations that the Brazilian driver died at the Imola track . Senna ' s brother , Edoardo , and some news_reports suggested the 34-year-old Formula One star died at the scene Sunday , and that it might have been covered_up to avoid the summoning of a coroner and an immediate investigation , causing the race ' s postponement . Grand Prix organizers must pay heavy penalties to commercial sponsors and television networks if a race is not held_on schedule . Senna , a three-time Formula One champion , was pronounced dead at 6:40 p.m. at Maggiore Hospital in Bologna , about four hours after he crashed at about 180 m.p.h. Hospital director Giuseppe Guerra said in a statement that medical_reports &quot; unequivocally show that Senna died at 6:40 p.m. Sunday when his heart stopped beating. &quot; &quot; Speculations about the truthfulness of what was reported by the doctors is injurious to their professionalism , &quot; Guerra said . In a related matter , a 16-year-old Senna fan fatally shot herself in Curitiba , Brazil , the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported . &quot; I ' ve gone_to meet Ayrton Senna , &quot; Zuleika da Costa Rosa said in a note .</TEXT>
