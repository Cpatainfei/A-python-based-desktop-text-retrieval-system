   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE CREW LAUGHS ITS WAY TO ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT LIFTOFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frustrated by problems that have delayed their space shuttle mission , astronauts Tuesday turned_to jokes and disguises , hoping that Friday ' s scheduled Endeavour launch succeeds . Flight_engineer Dan Bursch donned a Groucho Marx nose and glasses as he arrived in Florida.He told reporters that the rest of the crew had asked him to fly in disguise to ensure the shuttle gets_off the ground this time . The mission ' s first launch , set for Aug . 18 , was aborted only 1.9 seconds before liftoff because of an engine problem . &quot; Another recommendation somebody made was , click my heels three times and say , ' There ' s no place like space , ' &quot; said Bursch , the only astronaut who has experienced two aborted launches . He was also aboard Endeavour in August , 1993 , when the shuttle was only able to take_off after four tries . NASA started a routine countdown Tuesday , a_few hours after a jet carrying Bursch and his five crew mates landed at Kennedy . Once in Earth orbit , the six astronauts will tend a pair of remote-controlled radars in the shuttle cargo bay and conduct a variety of small science experiments for 10 days .</TEXT>
