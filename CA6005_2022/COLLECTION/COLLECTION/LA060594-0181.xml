   <TEXT> Lawrence ( Ed ) McCarthy of Camarillo knew it was going_to be a big mission when he heard they were serving steak and eggs in the officers ' mess on the morning of June 6 , 1944 . * Bedridden at a military_hospital in Bodney , England , with what doctors feared was an appendicitis attack , the 22-year-old U . S . Army Air_Force first_lieutenant missed the breakfast . But McCarthy promised himself that he wasn ' t going_to miss this mission . The long-awaited time for the D-day invasion had finally come . &quot; I was in the hospital and heard over the radio that all able-bodied men were to report to their units , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; I wasn ' t in the pain I was the day before , so I talked to the doctor and he agreed to release me . I had a sense of what was about to happen and I didn ' t want to miss it. &quot; A_few hours later , McCarthy was at the controls of his P-51 Mustang fighter , skimming_over the turbulent English_Channel at just over 300 m.p.h. He and his fellow members of the 328th Fighter Squadron -- known as the Blue Nosed Bastards of Bodney -- were headed for Normandy . Assigned to a divebombing mission designed to prevent the Germans from reinforcing their beachside positions , McCarthy had no idea how big the invasion force would be . But as he approached the_French coastline at an altitude of about 500 feet , he was awe-struck at what he saw in the water below him . &quot; It almost looked_like you could walk across the ships , there were so damned many out there , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; It was nothing short of amazing. &quot; McCarthy said that as he was approaching the invasion site , his thoughts were focused_on the location of the Allied troops beneath him , the weather and his low altitude . &quot; We were given a 20-by-20-mile sector to cover , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; We were told that if anything moved within that area we were to take it out . We did. &quot; On D-day and the weeks that followed , McCarthy flew roughly twice the number of sorties he normally flew in support of the Allied invasion force as it advanced through France and into Germany . &quot; It was the custom that if you completed a mission you could get a ration of two ounces of what we called combat whiskey , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; But at that time we were practically living_in our flight suits . We ' d come_back , eat and then sleep . We didn ' t have the time or the energy to drink. &quot; More_than 153 # 000 American and Allied soldiers combined to strike at five separate beaches on the Normandy coast that morning , backed_up by an armada of 5 # 000 ships and more_than 12 # 000 aircraft . In all , the Allied invasion was the largest amphibious_assault force the world has ever known . And , the losses suffered during the invasion were staggering . Nearly 6 # 600 American soldiers died during during the first 24 hours of the attack , half of them during the first few hours of the invasion at Omaha Beach . By the time Paris was liberated in August of that year , 37 # 000 Allied soldiers died in the conquest of Hitler ' s &quot; Fortress Europe. &quot; And for McCarthy and other Ventura County veterans of D-day , the sights , sounds and smells of the invasion will be forever burned into their memories . Norman Elton of Ventura remembers the invasion like it happened yesterday . For Elton , then a 24-year-old British Army staff_sergeant , the invasion was memorable not only because of its strategic importance , but also because it marked his first mission flying a glider into enemy territory . The gliders in Elton ' s squadron were made of plywood , had an 88-foot wingspan and were capable of carrying either 30 fully outfitted troops or two jeeps . They were towed by aircraft until a_few miles before their target and then released . Junked after a single flight , they were capable of landing anywhere and needed no airstrip . On the morning of D-day , 250 British gliders were launched . Elton and his co-pilot had a cargo of two jeeps . Released by his tow plane five miles offshore from Normandy , the Ventura veteran marveled at the armada massing below him . &quot; It was the most magnificent sight , &quot; Elton said . &quot; For miles you could see in every direction nothing but Navy ships. &quot; At his intended landing site , a_few miles inland from the beaches of Normandy near the river Orne , Elton was supposed to deliver the two jeeps to help Allied units protect their eastern flank . As they were landing in a field , they saw a German tank . But the tank suddenly turned and retreated from the area , removing the threat as the glider landed . &quot; He could have done a tremendous amount of damage had he stayed , &quot; Elton said . &quot; The Germans weren ' t quite sure what was going on. &quot; Elton , now 74 , says the_British glider squadrons took a beating that morning . His squadron lost 34 men and 17 gliders . &quot; If you saw a church_tower or a steeple , 10 to 1 there ' d be a German sniper in it , &quot; Elton said . But most of the gliders carried_out their missions and their role in the invasion was viewed_as a success . &quot; It was the first time we had used such a big concentration of gliders . I think we took them by surprise. &quot; When the landing_craft carrying Bob Tanner of Camarillo lowered its main door , he expected to find the sand of Omaha Beach under his feet when he stepped off the craft . Instead , like many of his comrades that day , the 22-year-old U . S . Army staff_sergeant found himself nearly waist deep in the waves and struggling to stay upright with his 70-pound pack as German defensive fire from 88-millimeter cannons and machine_guns sprayed all around him . Tanner , who was with the 1st Infantry Division -- the Army_unit known as the Big Red One -- carried a silver_dollar good-luck charm with him on D-day . And he still believes that is why he wasn ' t killed . &quot; Of the 192 men we had in my company , 57 were killed and 24 wounded within the first hour of the invasion , &quot; Tanner said . &quot; I guess you could say that my lucky buck worked. &quot; Tanner , who participated in the Allied invasions of North Africa in 1942 and Sicily in 1943 , said that his company was warned that Normandy would be rough . But he adds that none of his comrades could have expected what they encountered that morning on Omaha Beach -- the bloodiest of the five Allied landing beaches at Normandy . &quot; I think our company had a bit of a cocky attitude because of the first two invasions , but Omaha was a meat_grinder , &quot; said Tanner , now 72 . &quot; The first thing you wanted to do was to get_away from the landing_craft . You had to have a tough attitude that you were going_to get_through despite the fact that guys you were just talking to were dying in front of you . You just had to keep moving. &quot; Tanner said that his company landed at Omaha at 6:30 a.m. and that it was 12:30 p.m. before members of his unit were able to get_off the beach . The Omaha assault required the invaders to cross nearly 200 yards of open beach before reaching a concrete seawall at the base of some bluffs . It took at least five more days before his ears stopped ringing from the constant sound of mortar and machine-gun fire . &quot; I ' m proud_of what we did there , &quot; Tanner said . &quot; But we all paid a heck of a price . A lot of good friends of mine didn ' t make_it out of there . They ' re the heroes , not me. &quot; Tanner said that his division lived_up_to its battle-hardened motto that day -- &quot; No mission too difficult , no sacrifice too great , nothing in hell can stop the 1st Division. &quot; For Vincent A . Transano , the command historian of the Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center , the invasion was a test of courage for the Navy Seabees who braved German gunfire as they prepared a safe path for the landing_craft . Transano said the first Seabees ashore were members of the Naval Combat Demolition Units , which had the job of blasting holes through German defenses on the beach so that the first assault wave could land . Later during the first day of the invasion , Seabees built harbors , breakwaters , bridges and causeways off the five Normandy beaches where no natural harbors or shelters previously existed . &quot; The Seabees played a pivotal role in the landings at Normandy , &quot; Transano said . &quot; They did all_of this critical work_at breakneck speed , and all_the while under enemy fire from the ground and the air. &quot; Edward J . Marolda , a military historian associated with the Naval Historical Center in Washington said that while other battles during World_War_II saw far more casualties , the landing at Normandy was the critical element in the effort to wrest Europe from the clutches of Germany . Marolda added that Operation Overlord -- the invasion ' s code name -- was made_possible only by the success of U . S . Navy forces in the Battle of the Atlantic , where sea_lanes from the United States to England were made safe for the shipping of war material and troops . As a result , the Navy , Coast Guard and Merchant_Marine were able to move more_than 1.5 million men and their equipment to D-day staging_areas along the southern coast of England . &quot; D-day represented the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany , &quot; Marolda said . &quot; Had we not succeeded there , the prosecution of the war would have been delayed months and thousands more American and Allied soldiers would have died taking_back Europe. &quot; But despite the risks , the exhilaration and the fear that came_with being a part of one of the most famous assault forces in history , Camarillo ' s Lawrence McCarthy eschews the idea that he is a hero . &quot; I ' m proud_of my contribution , but I ' m not a hero , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; My country was at war and she needed me . I ' m pleased to be a small part of history , but that wasn ' t my objective nor was I thinking_about it at the time . I was just doing the best job I knew how. &quot; Times correspondent Phyllis W .
