   <HEADLINE> GAY FILM FEST DIRECTOR MOVING_ON ; MOVIES : AFTER PRESENTING MORE THAN 1 # 400 FILMS AND VIDEOS TO AN AUDIENCE OF MORE THAN 210 # 000 , LARRY HORNE LOOKS_BACK ON 12 YEARS WITH THE ANNUAL EVENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the 12th edition of the Los Angeles International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film &amp; Video Festival opens tonight at the Directors Guild , its founder-director Larry Horne will be stepping_down to become a producer . At 37 , Horne can look_back at having presented more_than 1 # 400 films and videos to an audience of more_than 210 # 000 during the festival ' s 12-year history . In 1982 , there were 29 films presented from seven countries ; this year , there will be 242 offerings from 29 countries . The box-office take has grown from $ 6 # 780 to last year ' s $ 105 # 000 . &quot; It ' s been personally a highly gratifying activity -- my passion , &quot; said Horne in an interview at his Beverly Boulevard office last week . &quot; My driving_force has been in having an impact upon people ' s lives , and I ' ve been almost maniacal about it . But now I ' m ready to move_on , to try_for even more access on a different level. &quot; Morgan Rumpf , of Arts Inc. , a nonprofit organization that provides technical assistance to nonprofit arts organizations , will succeed Horne on Aug . 8 . Then , Horne will be able to devote all his energies to launching , with a group of friends , Out Entertainment Group , an independent production and distribution company that will develop gay- and lesbian-themed material for video and cable as well as the big screen . It has already optioned for filming James Baker ' s &quot; Tim and Pete , &quot; which Horne enthusiastically describes as &quot; a gay ' Thelma &amp; Louise ' -- smart , sassy and mid- ' 90s. &quot; * Horne said he has witnessed a tremendous change in attitude over the years toward the festival , both on the part of distributors and the public . &quot; I went_through a long period of constantly defining what we were , a festival featuring mainly independent productions and foreign films , &quot; he said . &quot; We were such an unknown_quantity , people would actually ask if a gay and lesbian film festival was devoted to pornography ! &quot; Horne used to complain loudly about the difficulty of getting distributors to contribute gay- and lesbian-themed products for the festival . But now , he said , &quot; films have been easier to get_in the last couple of years. &quot; Four or five years ago , when the festival requested &quot; Waiting for the Moon , &quot; the Gertrude Stein-Alice B . Toklas movie , Horne says , &quot; we got an outright no &quot; from the film ' s distributor , Skouras Pictures . &quot; We didn ' t get ' My Own Private Idaho ' or ' The Crying Game , ' but I got pretty far with ' Philadelphia , ' ( however ) it went_to the APLA for a benefit premiere . We now get nicer ' no ' s , ' not just bull. &quot; There could scarcely be a better indication of the festival ' s coming of_age than its landing of this year ' s Cannes Film Festival sensation from Australia , &quot; The Adventures of Priscilla , Queen of the Desert , &quot; a giddy , hilarious yet poignant comedy about the experiences of three drag performers traveling across Australia ' s rugged outback in a gaudily decorated bus . The film has a real &quot; La Cage aux Folles &quot; crossover potential , and according to Horne was &quot; easy to get. &quot; Gramercy , the film ' s distributor , told Horne &quot; it wanted it in the festival. &quot; &quot; Once distributors feared that their gay-themed films would be pigeonholed by being in the festival , but now some of our films , the non-threatening ones , attract some straights , &quot; Horne said . &quot; There ' s no way of measuring this , but I do know last year straights came_to see ' Grief ' and ' The Living End , ' especially. &quot; Horne was a UCLA graduate_student in film history when he and a classmate , John Ramirez , now a professor of film at Cal State Los Angeles , returned from San Francisco ' s 1981 gay and lesbian festival , thinking it was time L.A. had its own event . With another classmate , Claire Aguilar , now KCET ' s manager of broadcast programming , they approached UCLA Film and Television Archive director Robert Rosen and head film programmer Geoffrey Gilmore , who offered immediate support . * The late Gary Essert , co-founder of Filmex and later the American Cinematheque , lent crucial help , and the late Vito Russo , gay activist and pioneering historian on the representation of gays and lesbians in films , appeared at the first festival and provided early moral support . In its initial three years the festival was held at UCLA , moving_on to the Four Star Theater in 1985 and finally to the Directors Guild in 1988 . &quot; We made a lot of noise to have Christopher Street West -- which presents the Gay Pride Parade and Festival every year -- support us , and a group we formed in 1985 under their auspices got almost $ 20 # 000 , &quot; Horne said . &quot; They didn ' t want to do_it again because we broke_even instead of making a profit . So in 1986 we formed a nonprofit organization , Bob Rosen signed_on to the board and lined_up other directors for us. &quot; By 1989 , Horne -- who had worked_at the UCLA Film and Television Archive , at KCET ( as a special programs director ) and at the AFI ' s Preservation Center -- was able to work full time for the festival . Horne said he was grateful to Four Star proprietor Louis Federici for his modest rental fees but feels the festival didn ' t come_into its own until ending_up at the Directors Guild . &quot; It was in 1988 that the festival really took_off , &quot; Horne said . &quot; We had a larger impact , bigger audiences and growing awareness of our existence . People feel secure in coming_to the DGA and more_than ever people are interested in discovering what gay culture is all about. &quot; * The 12th annual Los Angeles International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film &amp; Video Festival continues at the Directors Guild of America , 7920 Sunset Blvd. , Hollywood , through July 17 .
