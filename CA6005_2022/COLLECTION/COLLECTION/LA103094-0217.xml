   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / MINIMAL MOVIES : ANDY WARHOL ' S DREAM FACTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1963 , Pop artist Andy Warhol , then the reigning enfant_terrible of the avant-garde , got a movie_camera and began turning_out films at a furious pace . Shot largely at his studio known as the Factory , an avant-garde petri_dish where the grooviest people on Earth gathered to take drugs , party and keep the wheels of Warhol ' s art mill running , these wildly unfettered films broke the boundaries of conventional cinema in every way imaginable . Life at the Factory changed dramatically , however , in June , 1968 , when Warhol was shot in the stomach by a deranged woman named Valerie Solanas . No longer a free_zone where weirdos of every stripe could wander in and out at their leisure , the Factory took_on the aura of a fortress , and other things changed as well . Warhol took all his existing films out of circulation , believing that their unavailability would increase their value . After completing &quot; Blue Movie &quot; ( a film that was withdrawn from theaters the following year when it was declared obscene by New York ' s Criminal_Court ) , he handed the directorial duties on all future films_over to one of his assistants , Paul Morrissey . Warhol settled into the producer ' s chair at this point and began creating such movies as &quot; Andy Warhol ' s Dracula &quot; and &quot; Andy Warhol ' s Frankenstein &quot; -- films widely seen as Warhol ' s attempt to go Hollywood . &quot; Andy had this dream he was really gonna end_up in Hollywood -- they say it ' s the only dream he could never fulfill , &quot; says Ronald Tavel , who scripted a dozen of Warhol ' s films in the ' 60s and appeared in several more . The hundreds of films Warhol shot between 1963-68 have been largely unseen for decades . Now , through the combined efforts of the Warhol Foundation and New York ' s Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum , they ' re being restored and released at a rate of approximately six per year ( 24 films have been released so far ) . Los Angeles will get its first look_at films whose years of absence have bathed them in a mythical glow Thursday through Sunday when &quot; Warhol Weekend : The Films of Andy Warhol &quot; comes_to the Pacific Design Center . A benefit for the local film collective Filmforum , the program includes a dozen films , among them &quot; The Velvet Underground and Nico , &quot; &quot; The Chelsea Girls &quot; and four films featuring the ill-fated debutante Edie Sedgwick . Curated by critic David Ehrenstein , the benefit includes an opening-night party , appearances by Tavel and actress Susan Bottomly , and the projection of &quot; Empire &quot; -- Warhol ' s eight-hour film of the Empire_State Building -- on the exterior of the Pacific Design Center . Often described as the first Deconstructivist director , Warhol breaks film down into four rudimentary components : fixed images , movement , sound and behavior ( one is reluctant to use words like plot or story in_regards_to his rigorously Minimal films ) . Drawing freely from both Hollywood and the avant-garde , Warhol dreamed of a never-ending , all-inclusive movie , and saw film as a medium that could ultimately reveal everything about its subject . Toward those ends he completed everything from a film that ran_for 25 hours ( &quot; Four Star &quot; ) to hundreds of &quot; screen_tests &quot; that were nothing more_than Warhol ' s training his camera on people who struck his fancy . Needless to say , mainstream moviegoing audiences of the ' 60s found Warhol ' s early films taxing at best , but chances are good that ' 90s film historians are going_to find much that ' s worthwhile in this long-lost body_of_work . &quot; The most widely held misconception about Andy ' s films is that they ' re purely conceptual , and that if somebody describes them to you , you don ' t have to see them , &quot; says Tavel , who met Warhol when he was a young poet reading in New York cafes in the early ' 60s . &quot; The other big misconception is that any mistakes that occurred were fine with him -- his films were much more thought through and calculated than people realize. &quot; In addition to the contribution Warhol ' s movies made to the lexicon of film , they provide a fascinating record of the social phenomena of the ' 60s , when the nuclear_family began to disintegrate , the sexual revolution erupted and drug use was rampant . Looked_at today , when we know the wages of drugs and casual sex far too well , those idyllic Factory days seem a_million light_years ago ; oddly , Warhol ' s people seem almost innocent in their decadence . Even more fascinating is the alchemy of personality that occurred under the watchful gaze of Warhol , who had an intuitive feeling for combustive combinations of people . One could make the case that human behavior is the only subject of his films , and he shows it with an unflinching candor that verges on cruelty . Obsessed with the cultural virus known as fame , Warhol redefined the concept of movie_star , creating his own category of performer that he dubbed &quot; superstar &quot; -- anyone who could carry a film on the strength of personality alone . In fact , many of Warhol ' s performers do nothing more_than turn_up the volume on_their_own personalities ; several of his films amount to little more_than very long_shots of one of his superstars killing time in some hotel_room or apartment . &quot; Andy didn ' t actually direct anybody in his films , and words like auteur and director don ' t really apply to him , &quot; says Tavel , who wrote &quot; Vinyl &quot; and &quot; The Life of Juanita Castro , &quot; which are included in the Filmforum program . &quot; He was more an entrepreneur whose aesthetic controlled the films . In fact , he didn ' t like to work directly on most of the films -- all_the art he made revolved to a degree around the act of removing himself. &quot; &quot; Andy didn ' t actually do anything -- that was the essence of his talent , &quot; observes actress Mary Woronov , who met Warhol when she was a 20-year-old art_student at Cornell and appeared in seven of his films made between 1964-68 . &quot; I remember a scene in one film where I was_on a bed with ( poet ) Ed Hood and Andy kept saying ' Do something , Mary , do something. ' He couldn ' t think_of anything for me to do , so he just kept saying ' Do something. ' My most vivid memory of Andy is of him standing there with his white , white skin complaining bitterly in this little whine. &quot; In reading the history of Warhol ' s activities as a filmmaker , one is struck by the fact that his collaborators tended to come and go rather quickly . Described by some as a psychic vampire -- someone who drained the vital juices of whoever crossed his path , then moved_on to new talent -- Warhol seemed to attract self-destructive people , and a surprising percentage of the ' 60s Factory people are now dead . Sedgwick , a lovely young_woman who died of an overdose less than 10 years after meeting Warhol , is the best known of the Factory fatalities , but there were many_more like her . &quot; Andy had lots of different interests and didn ' t care to repeat himself -- those people weren ' t professional actors anyway , &quot; says rock singer Lou Reed of the rapid overturn of personnel at the Factory . &quot; Andy didn ' t have a destructive influence on those people -- he gave people great opportunities -- he certainly gave me one ( Warhol sponsored the Velvet Underground ) , and I always found him to be incredibly fair , generous and brilliant. &quot; Counters poet Gerard Malanga , who met Warhol when he was a 20-year-old student at Cornell and was hired by the artist as an assistant silk-screener : &quot; Andy had a destructive effect on people in that he created a dream world some people bought_into , and that dream was never fulfilled . Some of those people thought they had a legitimate career in the movies working with Andy -- which was a very naive thing to think . &quot; I never considered myself an actor , and appeared in the films as a way of drawing attention to my work as a poet , &quot; adds Malanga , who will publish a book of poems , &quot; Mythologies of the Heart , &quot; next year , and who can be seen this weekend in &quot; Vinyl &quot; and &quot; The Chelsea Girls , &quot; a 3 1 / 2-hour split-screen opus considered by many to be Warhol ' s greatest film . &quot; The people in Andy ' s world were self-destructive to begin with , and the case can be made that the creativity he allowed those doomed people was the happiest time of their life , &quot; says Ronald Tavel , who presently lives in Taiwan where he teaches screenwriting . &quot; But did he care about people ? I don ' t think he did , nor did he expect people to stay a long time. &quot; &quot; Warhol was always looking_for the new thing , and many of those people went crazy because they took lots of drugs and were heavily into amphetamines -- everything was fast with them , &quot; adds Woronov , who continues to act and also has a career as a painter . &quot; Working with Andy was the high point in many of their lives . &quot; Those people are dead for the simple reason that you can ' t live like that -- it ' s too close to the sun , &quot; she concludes . &quot; Andy took risks and he put the people around him at risk , and there was a direct relationship between how destructively they were living and their brilliance . When you take risks like that with your body and your mind you get someplace , but eventually you go_over the top. &quot; For program information , call Filmforum at ( 213 ) 466-4143 .</TEXT>
