   <HEADLINE> EDUCATION SUMMIT OFFERS HUGE RANGE OF IDEAS ON SCHOOLS ; LEARNING : SHEER VOLUME AND DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS AT CONFERENCE SHOWS IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO REACH CONSENSUS ON OVERHAULING STATE INSTITUTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the education summit here was meant to be a marketplace of ideas on public_schools , Tuesday ' s opening session was the main bazaar where hawkers sought attention for their intellectual wares . Groups from the California Business Roundtable to the California Teachers Assn . unveiled ambitious shopping lists for school reform . Others sought to use the gathering of 500 business , education and political_leaders to get their own ideas out for public consumption . Assembly Speaker Willie Brown , who convened the meeting and led the panel sessions Tuesday , called the exercise a &quot; think-tank session. &quot; Its aim , he said , was to write an agenda for overhauling California ' s schools . But the sheer volume of divergent ideas and priorities bandied_about at the Westin St . Francis Hotel indicated that building consensus will be not be easy . For example , Republican Gov . Pete Wilson said , &quot; before we do anything else we must . . . make our classrooms safe again. &quot; Senate leader Bill Lockyer , a Democrat from Hayward , called_for &quot; re-examining the strictures of Proposition 13 , &quot; which slashed local school funding almost a generation ago . State Sen . Gary K . Hart ( D-Santa Barbara ) , longtime chairman of the Senate Education Committee , said the gathering of so many opinions under one roof was a rare opportunity to hear a broad spectrum of thought on education . &quot; My initial feeling was this is all PR , &quot; Hart said . &quot; But as I look_at it and think_about it , I think it ' s very helpful. &quot; After these sessions , he said , legislators might try to look_at the big picture when writing policies for local schools in the halls of Sacramento . He also had his own idea : Bring California back_up to the national average in per-pupil spending within five years . &quot; Everybody has a wish list , &quot; said business_leader Sanford Sigoloff , who was recently forced by opposition in the Legislature to withdraw as Wilson ' s nominee to head the state_Department of Education . Wilson subsequently appointed him to the State Board_of_Education . Some observers said the summit was most likely to produce consensus in areas in which there already is broad agreement that something needs to be done , such_as reducing campus violence , eliminating vast portions of the cumbersome Education Code and increasing schools ' access to technology . On Monday , for example , technology got a pre-summit boost with Pacific Bell ' s announcement that it will provide $ 100 million to begin wiring the state ' s public_schools and libraries with the equipment they need to be able to tap into outside resources via computers and phone_lines . Most participants Tuesday gave the schools credit for implementing some reforms while confronted with more and needier students and with a budget-depleting economy . All agreed that the schools need to do_better but can improve only with the help of political and business_leaders . Wilson called the schools ' performance record erratic , noting that some are among the nation ' s finest but &quot; too many are forced to confront problems not of_their_own making. &quot; The tightly orchestrated program frustrated some participants , who were given no more_than seven minutes each to make their points , but it ensured that no one group or ideology dominated the conference . Groups hoping for more attention distributed summaries of their proposals . Among them was the California Teachers Assn. , which touted its plan as the only one put_together by &quot; those who know students and education best &quot; -- teachers and parents . It called_for more education money to be spent in the classrooms . It also called_for involvement by teachers organizations in refining the state ' s fledgling efforts to broaden parents ' choices among public_schools , and to give charters to schools that allow them to operate with full autonomy . The association , the state ' s largest teachers union , initially opposed these programs . Among its other proposals were_full federal funding to send all needy youngsters to preschool , partnerships with businesses and more participation by parents in their children ' s schooling . The California Business Roundtable , made_up of leaders of the state ' s largest corporations , renewed its call_for an &quot; interlocking web of education and training &quot; from preschool through college and beyond . Holding schools accountable for student achievement , improving the transition from school to workplace and integrating technology with classroom instruction were some of the executives ' other proposals . Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) pushed a plan to set_up military-style charter schools for young troublemakers . The union that represents 300 # 000 non-teaching school employees wanted college-level instruction provided to school aides at their jobs so they can earn teaching credentials . The Assn . of Calif School Administrators called_for more attention to the stressful living conditions of today ' s students . The summit also blended policy and politics , as some of the nation ' s foremost education reformers and child advocates , including psychiatrist James P . Comer of the Yale_University Child Study Center and Marian Wright Edelman of the Children ' s Defense Fund , shared the spotlight with leading candidates for governor and state superintendent of public instruction . And it featured the re-emergence of Bill Honig , the education-reform leader who was forced to resign as state superintendent a year ago upon being convicted of felony conflict-of-interest charges . Beginning with an appearance at a pre-summit reception Monday night , Honig handed_out copies of a treatise he wrote_on reform efforts under way in California and elsewhere . Greeted warmly by many participants , Honig had a chance to promote his new Center for Systemic School Reform . The privately funded center is based at San Francisco State University , where Honig has been teaching since shortly after receiving his sentence to perform community service work . Brown said he expects corporate donors to pick_up most of the estimated $ 200 # 000 tab for the summit . Any balance will be paid from his campaign funds , he said .</TEXT>
