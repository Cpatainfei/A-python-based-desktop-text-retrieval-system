   <HEADLINE> SUICIDE FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Death Emerges as a Civil Liberty , &quot; by Derek Humphry , Commentary , Dec . 1 : Humphry ' s view that everyone has the right to suicide and the right to call_in members of the medical_profession as executioners is way off base . As nurses , we work hard every day to ensure physical and psychological comfort for our patients facing terminal illnesses . Adequate pain control , recognition and treatment of depression , family support services , hospice , etc . are but some of the tools we have to ensure a dignified and meaningful death for our patients . There is no dignity in being killed . It is false to portray euthanasia as a choice between a painful death prolonged by medical technology or a quick , painless death by lethal overdose . Pain relief does not prolong death but rather enhances the quality_of_life at its end . Refusal of futile or burdensome medical treatment is a well-recognized and ethical right of everyone . Ethical health_care professionals reject both unnecessary treatment as well as euthanasia . Our society has long provided suicide prevention programs out of the recognition that killing_oneself is a tragic mistake . We do not accept financial difficulties , failed relationships and the_like as justifications for suicide . How callous and discriminatory it would be to now tell terminally ill people that we don ' t really care if they kill themselves . Euthanasia is not about suicide or personal choice but rather about abandoning vulnerable people and requiring doctors and nurses to suspend the most basic_principle of the healing professions : &quot; Do no harm. &quot; GERMAINE WENSLEY RN , President California Nurses for Ethical Standards Los Angeles * Every living thing will die ! The question is when ? How ? Where ? In many cases it is a question of mercy and love and kindness ! My father died a_few months ago . We buried what was left of him . . . about 75 pounds of bone and skin . For about two years he lay_in his own bed , blind , and cared_for by a loving wife and a full-time care person to tend the bedsores , feed and change him much like a helpless baby . The prostate cancer nibbled away at his body like invisible maggots until he was too weak to move . The morphine stopped the pain in his body , but this once-proud and independent spirit became twisted and tormented , for the clarity of his mind made his situation unbearable . Twice I ' ve made the choice to put my dearly loved dogs out of their misery when there was no hope for recovery . I held them close_in my arms while the veterinarian administered a painless shot and they drifted_off to a final rest . How I wish my father had been given this choice -- a right not to end life but to shorten the agony of the dying process . I will fight to have this most basic of freedoms for myself .
