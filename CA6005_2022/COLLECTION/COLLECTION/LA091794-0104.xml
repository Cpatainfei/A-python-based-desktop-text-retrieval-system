   <HEADLINE> ALAMO GETS 6-YEAR TERM FOR FEDERAL TAX_EVASION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in his years of trouble with the law , flamboyant evangelist Tony Alamo was sentenced to prison Friday , a six-year federal tax-evasion term that has Los Angeles prosecutors wondering whether they need to follow_through on his scheduled child_abuse trial . Alamo , winding_up a three-day hearing in a federal_court in Memphis , asked_for probation or some_other alternative to prison . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , you could deport me to Israel and that would be just fine , &quot; he said . The 59-year-old evangelist , who once ran a religious commune in Saugus and proselytized throughout the Los Angeles area for converts to his Holy Alamo Christian_Church , has been at_odds with the law for many years . He was a fugitive for almost three years after he disappeared in 1989 as Los Angeles County authorities investigated allegations that he gave telephone instructions to four men to strike an 11-year-old boy 140 times with a large paddle at the Saugus commune . He was captured in July , 1991 , and is still awaiting trial on the child_abuse charges in Los Angeles . The federal judge in Memphis on Friday imposed the maximum possible prison_term on Alamo and fined him $ 210 # 000 for his June 8 conviction on charges of filing a false income_tax_return in 1985 and failing to file tax_returns for the next three years , Internal Revenue Service spokesman Dan Boone said . He has been in jail since his conviction . Alamo , whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman , was scheduled to return to Los Angeles to stand trial on state charges in the alleged beating of a young boy , but the federal prison sentence has local prosecutors wondering if the effort would be worth it . Deputy Dist . Atty . John Asari said his office must now consider how much of the federal sentence Alamo will serve , and weigh the trauma to the alleged victim of putting him on the stand against the additional prison time Alamo might receive if he is convicted of child_abuse . &quot; At this point we ' re prepared to go_to trial , &quot; Asari said . &quot; But this gives us something to think_of in terms of settling the case. &quot; A hearing on the state case is scheduled for Sept . 26 . Alamo gained fame and fortune when he and his wife , Susan , founded the Holy Alamo Christian_Church in the 1960s , taking young dropouts and drug_users off the streets of Hollywood and providing them with food , shelter and anti-Catholic religious sermons . Communes and church-owned businesses staffed with free labor by hundreds of followers in California , Arkansas and Tennessee earned millions in the 1970s and 1980s , particularly off the production of glitzy rhinestone-studded denim jackets Alamo designed , which sold in exclusive boutiques for as much as $ 600 each . The IRS eventually stripped the Alamo Foundation of its tax-exempt status . IRS officials claim the Alamos shortchanged the government an estimated $ 10 million in taxes on income earned from a variety of businesses , using the tax-exempt Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation and later the Music Square Church . Alamo argued he owed no taxes because he had no salary . He said the businesses financed his ministry and the church simply supported him as its spiritual_leader . During Alamo ' s tax-evasion trial in Memphis , the government accused him of controlling the private lives of his followers and said he has married eight of his followers since early last year , including two 15-year-old girls .</TEXT>
