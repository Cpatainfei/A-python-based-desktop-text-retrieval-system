   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 188 ; TOBACCO_INDUSTRY USES NEW TACTIC IN ADS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Portraying their initiative as an anti-smoking measure , the tobacco_industry is airing radio spots in which a woman identifying herself as a school vice principal claims that Proposition 188 will keep children away from cigarettes . But California ' s top health official , and other critics of the measure on the Nov . 8 ballot , call the ad one more ruse to sell the initiative to California voters . They say Proposition 188 will repeal far stronger laws already on the books that limit minors ' access to cigarettes . &quot; I ' m hard-pressed to see how 188 is a stronger approach to this very difficult problem , &quot; said California Health Director S . Kimberly Belshe . The new Proposition 188 radio spot features a woman ' s voice claiming to be a vice principal . The voice describes Proposition 188 as the &quot; best way to keep cigarettes away from kids. &quot; &quot; I ' ve been working with kids for 24 years , &quot; the voice says . &quot; I know what motivates them , and I understand the way they think . I want to stop kids from smoking . Proposition 188 will help do that. &quot; The commercial is the first to be broadcast in the campaign over the tobacco_industry initiative , and represents a key component of cigarette makers ' campaign to persuade voters that Proposition 188 is not merely an underhanded attempt to make_it easier for smokers of their products to light_up . &quot; The tobacco_industry ' s claim of cracking_down on kids ' access to cigarettes is misleading at best and fraudulent at worst , &quot; said Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , one of the harshest critics of Proposition 188 . Several other provisions of the measure also purport to restrict smoking . But for each one of the proposal ' s components , there are local ordinances or state anti-smoking laws that are tougher on smoking in public places . If passed , Proposition 188 would repeal all local smoking ordinances and knock other state smoking laws off the books . Proponents say 188 contains all_the restrictions necessary , and present the new ad to pitch that message . The ad describes the initiative as a &quot; common_sense approach to help keep tobacco away from minors , &quot; and concludes by saying that the spot was sponsored by Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions -- which is funded by tobacco companies . &quot; It is an important piece of the initiative , and an important part of the campaign , &quot; Lee Stitzenberger , strategist and spokesman for the pro-tobacco initiative , said of minors ' access to cigarettes . He said the speaker in the radio ad is a public_school vice principal , but would not name her or say where she works . She was not paid , he added . Stitzenberger previously said he had no plans to air radio or television ads . But with Proposition 188 leading among likely voters in a recent Times poll , that strategy has changed . Stitzenberger has reserved commercial time on television and radio_stations statewide . A second radio spot features restaurant owners saying they support 188 because they want the right to decide whether to permit smoking . These campaign spots and others in the works are going unanswered by the initiative ' s foes , a struggling coalition of health groups and anti-smoking activists . Jack Nicholl , consultant to the No on 188 effort , said he hopes to air radio ads late in the campaign . Nicholl called the vice principal ad , which plays_on people ' s desire to stop children from smoking , &quot; the ultimate in cynicism. &quot; The initiative would increase penalties for selling tobacco to minors , allowing_for fines of up_to $ 2 # 000 . However , the initiative also is worded so that business owners can avoid fines by posting signs saying cigarette sales to minors are illegal , and having their employees sign statements saying they know it is against the law to sell cigarettes to children . Belshe said she believes the initiative may repeal a tough new law aimed at stopping cigarettes to minors . The law , set to go_into effect Jan . 1 , would increase penalties to $ 6 # 000 , authorize civil lawsuits against businesses that sell cigarettes to minors , and permit the Department of Health Services to join the enforcement effort . Carried by Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , the bill was signed into law by Belshe ' s boss , Gov . Pete Wilson . Wilson and his Democratic challenger , Treasurer Kathleen Brown , oppose Proposition 188 . Hayden said he wrote the bill to ensure that the initiative would not overturn it . But if Proposition 188 passes , there is likely to be a court fight to determine whether Hayden ' s law will stand . Although the impact on Hayden ' s bill is unclear , the initiative repeals 150 local ordinances that ban or significantly restrict cigarette vending_machines , a major source of cigarettes for minors . The initiative would prevent local_governments from passing new vending_machines restrictions .</TEXT>
