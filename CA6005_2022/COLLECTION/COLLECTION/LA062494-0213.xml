   <HEADLINE> FRENCH UNITS MOVE INTO RWANDA , VOW NOT TO PROVOKE REBELS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> French marines and Foreign Legionnaires headed into the chaos of Rwanda on Thursday to try to stem the ethnic slaughter that has horrified the world . They pledged not to pick a fight with rebel forces who view them as enemies . The commander of the small U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda said he hoped the_French would stay_away_from front_lines between troops of Rwanda ' s Hutu-dominated government and the mainly Tutsi rebel movement . A small group of French soldiers in armored vehicles met no opposition and was welcomed by locals after advancing several miles into western Rwanda , a military spokesman said in Paris . The Rwandan army is believed to control the western third of the small Central African_nation . The rebels have won control of the eastern two-thirds since the war resumed April 6 after a suspicious plane crash killed Rwanda ' s Hutu president , who had reached a power-sharing accord with the Tutsi minority . About 40 Foreign Legion paratroopers protected by helicopter gunships crossed the border from Bukavu , 60 miles south of Goma , the military said . Their goal was to secure a refugee camp near Cyangugu to protect 8 # 000 Tutsis from the widespread slaughter being inflicted on the tribe by Hutu militias . The United Nations and aid groups estimate that hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have died in the past two months , most of them civilians . A reconnaissance team of French marines also headed from Goma for the northwestern region of Gisenyi , French state radio reported , quoting an unidentified government source . &quot; The role is only to protect refugees , &quot; said Col . Andre Schill , a French spokesman in Goma . He said French troops would use their weapons only if threatened or to protect refugees . &quot; We are not out here to make a new war , but to protect people . We are not here to shoot , &quot; he told reporters . The French government said it is sending about 2 # 500 soldiers and marines for the two-month mission that was authorized Wednesday by the U.N. Security_Council as a stopgap until a larger , all-African peacekeeping force can be deployed . Schill said 500 French soldiers already were in Goma , including marine infantrymen , supply troops and combat engineers . About 250 paratroopers were in Bukavu , he said . French troops are turning the airport at Kisangani , Zaire , into an air_base to support the mission , dubbed &quot; Operation Turquoise. &quot; In Kigali , Rwanda ' s capital , Maj . Gen . Romeo Dallaire , the Canadian commander of the 450 U.N. peacekeepers , said he had not been contacted by the_French force but expected them to stay_away_from confrontation zones . Dallaire cautioned against intervening in a civil_war &quot; when you do not have the consent of both sides. &quot; He said he took seriously rebel threats to attack French troops . Although the_French government says the operation is a strictly humanitarian mission , the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front is suspicious because French intervention blocked a rebel offensive in 1990 . &quot; We have no doubt whatsoever that their intentions are far from being humanitarian , &quot; Theogene Rudasingwa , secretary_general of the Patriotic Front , told journalists in Paris . The rebels ' representative in Paris , Jacques Bihozagara , said rebel forces would not seek_out French troops . But he warned the rebels would &quot; treat them as invaders &quot; if they did make contact . French Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur said Wednesday that he could not exclude the possibility of fighting , but his conditions for the operation indicated that French troops would not deploy near rebel areas .</TEXT>
