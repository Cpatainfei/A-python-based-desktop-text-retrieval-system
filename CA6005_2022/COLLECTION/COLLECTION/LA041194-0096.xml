   <HEADLINE> NATO AIR STRIKE BACKS WORDS WITH ACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sunday ' s air_attack by two U.S. F-16C fighters on Bosnian Serb forces outside the besieged Bosnian city of Gorazde crossed a line from which Western political_leaders had tiptoed away from for two years : It suddenly escalated the role of the United States and its European allies in the intractable Balkans warfare . The bombing_run had only a limited military purpose , but its political message packed a wallop . After two years of idle threats to halt Serbian aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina , the West at last supported its words with deeds . &quot; We had said we would act if requested to do so , &quot; President Clinton said . &quot; We have now done so and will do so again if we are requested. &quot; A former Air_Force intelligence_officer who was at the Pentagon as the raids were being carried_out said later in an interview : &quot; You ' ve crossed a divide here . Finally , finally , they ran in U.N. troops and said , ' If you fire on them , we ' re going to bomb you. ' The Serbs tested them , and NATO passed the test. &quot; U.S. aircraft had tangled briefly in February with six Bosnian Serb airplanes that violated a &quot; no fly &quot; zone , and four of the Serbian planes were shot down . And U.N. forces threatened air strikes to enforce a call_for Bosnian Serb forces to pull their heavy artillery back from the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo . The Bosnian Serbs complied before any strikes were ordered . Before Sunday , North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization forces had not been involved in close air support directed at protecting U.N. troops hemmed_in on the ground by Bosnian Serbs -- a role similar to that performed by U.S. Air_Force fighters bailing_out ground troops under_fire a generation ago in Vietnam . Pentagon officials made the point of differentiating between Sunday ' s mission , intended to quickly give 12 U.N. observers some breathing room , and formal air strikes , which are often planned well in_advance and are intended to destroy an enemy ' s weaponry . The air_raid came_after a week of mixed signals from senior Clinton_Administration military and foreign_policy officials as Gorazde , a largely Muslim community designated as a haven from Serbian attack , came under increasing military pressure . A week ago , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry ruled_out the use of U.S. troops to prevent Bosnian Serbs from capturing additional territory as Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Gorazde , in eastern Bosnia , where 65 # 000 people were trapped . Asked whether the United States would consider air strikes or armed intervention to prevent the fall of Gorazde , Perry said : &quot; We will not enter the war to stop that from happening. &quot; A day later , Clinton pledged that NATO would provide air support for U.N. peacekeeping troops about to be dispatched to Gorazde . On Thursday , Anthony Lake , the President ' s national security adviser , said the Administration would not be willing to use U.S. air_power to stop Serbian attacks on the city before U.N. troops arrived there . But he also said neither the President nor his advisers &quot; rules_out the use of NATO power to help stop attacks such_as those against Gorazde. &quot; Then on Sunday morning , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said on the NBC news_program &quot; Meet the Press &quot; that if the U.N. commander in Bosnia , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , asked_for NATO air support , &quot; we ' re going to be paying a lot of attention to that and responding. &quot; Within an hour , the F-16Cs had struck . The request for the air support went_up the NATO chain of command and , in sharp contrast to an incident last month , approval was granted within 25 minutes . When French peacekeepers asked_for air support in March , authorization was granted more_than three hours later , and by then the Bosnian Serb forces had already taken cover . Sunday ' s raid was conducted by aircraft from the NATO base at Aviano , Italy . &quot; This was a picture-perfect one , &quot; said Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , during an interview on CNN . The Pentagon said the two fighters were under the direction of a U.N. forward air controller -- a soldier on the ground near the site of the target . The former Air_Force intelligence_officer took this to mean that the West had been planning a low-scale message-sending operation for at least several days , because of the time it takes_to place a skilled air controller on the ground . NATO Strikes Dispatched by NATO , two U.S. F-16C fighter planes struck Bosnian Serb targets near the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde . * Use : Multipurpose tactical fighter-bomber * Top speed : Over 1 # 000 m.p.h. * Weapons : Can carry 12 # 000 pounds of nuclear or non-nuclear weapons Source : Associated Press</TEXT>
