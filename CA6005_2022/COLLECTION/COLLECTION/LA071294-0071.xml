   <HEADLINE> GETTING INVOLVED : MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY ; FIGHT AGAINST AIDS DRAWING NEW RECRUITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Often , those who offer to help the AIDS Healthcare Foundation have lost someone to AIDS -- a family member , a friend , a co-worker . But increasingly , some volunteers have had no contact at all with people who have contracted the disease , such_as a college_student who either took a course or read a magazine_article , said Karen Dale Wolman , the foundation ' s director of volunteer resources . &quot; They realize how devastating it is , and they want to be involved with people who have AIDS , &quot; she said . Wolman , once a volunteer , got involved with the foundation through her work_on lesbian issues and because she has lost close friends to AIDS . Rather than trying to help someone you know with AIDS , she said , it is sometimes easier to help strangers as a volunteer for a group such_as the foundation . The organization , which runs two hospices and four outpatient clinics , provides help to AIDS patients regardless of their ability to pay . Its newest clinic opened in Sherman Oaks in November and has recently started looking_for volunteers for daytime office work . The new clinic especially needs bilingual volunteers . Although AIDS has devastated the homosexual population in the San Fernando Valley , the disease has been spreading to heterosexuals , including undocumented minorities , in greater numbers , said Joe Silva , the case manager for the Sherman Oaks clinic . Zanaida Vasquez , the clinic ' s office manager , remembers one case in which a woman was in the final stages of the disease . She had not gone_to the clinic because she was an undocumented resident . Finally , she went_to Olive View Medical_Center in Sylmar , where she died . &quot; They think we are going_to turn them in , &quot; said Vasquez , who added that the clinic closely protects the confidentiality of its patients . &quot; We need more education and outreach , &quot; Silva said . &quot; We want people to know we are here. &quot; Reaching heterosexuals with AIDS is also difficult because of the lingering stigma attached_to the disease . Because many see AIDS as only a gay disease , the denial among heterosexuals may run deep , Wolman said . &quot; We have residents ( dying ) in hospices who don ' t admit that they have AIDS. &quot; The foundation promises that no phone_call to its clinics will be ended until the person calling receives the help he or she needs , or a referral somewhere else in the network of agencies that deal with AIDS . &quot; Our philosophy is to provide one-stop shopping , &quot; said Wolman , explaining that the foundation ' s goal is to have as_many services as possible available through one site . The organization also is starting a free legal-service program within the next month , which will include help with wills , immigration , family issues and discrimination . For more information or to volunteer , call Vasquez at ( 818 ) 981-0041 or Wolman at ( 213 ) 462-2273 . The Burbank Tournament of Roses is looking_for volunteers to help with the construction of its &quot; Reach for the Wind &quot; float , which will appear in the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year ' s Day . Burbank is one of only six cities that build floats entirely with volunteer labor . Float work_parties are_on Wednesdays and Saturdays .
