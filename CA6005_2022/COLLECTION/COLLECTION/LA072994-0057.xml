   <HEADLINE> IS MOTION TO SEEK EVIDENCE IN SIMPSON CASE TOO BROAD ? ; LAW : DEFENSE WANTS INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP CLIENT . PROSECUTORS WILL ARGUE THAT THE REQUEST IS TOO SWEEPING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thirty-one years ago , the U.S. Supreme Court laid_down the law : Prosecutors have to give defendants any information that could help exonerate them . Since then , &quot; Brady motions &quot; -- named after the landmark Brady vs . Maryland decision -- have become a central element in criminal_law in the United States . Thousands are filed every year but none so widely watched as the one scheduled to be heard this morning in the O.J. Simpson murder case . At issue is Simpson ' s defense_lawyers ' sweeping request that the district_attorney ' s office immediately disclose any exculpatory investigative leads . It will be up_to Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito to determine the breadth of the prosecution ' s obligation . Brady motions are filed routinely and some are mere fishing expeditions . But in several important cases they have led to stunning outcomes : Charges have been dropped and convictions reversed when defense_lawyers could show that prosecutors failed to turn_over critical information -- even if it was a good-faith mistake . In the Simpson case , the defense is asking_for a lot : six months worth of police reports on prowlers or burglaries in the Brentwood neighborhood where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were murdered ; &quot; all police reports of unsolved similar murders in California in the past year &quot; ; all investigative leads concerning the backgrounds of associates of the victims ; any records of people who were treated for cuts or dog_bites at nearby hospital emergency_rooms in the 24 hours after the murders ; a computer match of any unidentified fingerprints found at the murder scene , and any other potentially exculpatory leads . Simpson ' s attorneys also are seeking personnel records of the detectives in the case , in part to determine whether there has been any disciplinary action taken against them and in part to establish whether any of them had reasons to bear a grudge against Simpson . One piece of information that would appear to fall within the scope of the request is a Jan . 19 , 1989 , letter by LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman , who discovered a key piece of evidence in the Simpson case . The letter , a copy of which was obtained by The Times , details a previous meeting Fuhrman had with the former football star and Nicole Simpson , then his wife . In his letter , Fuhrman said he had responded to a family dispute at Simpson ' s home_in late 1985 . When he arrived , Fuhrman said , he found O.J. Simpson in the driveway and his wife sitting near a car and sobbing . According to Fuhrman , she told him her husband had bashed in the windshield with a baseball_bat . Upon hearing this , Simpson said : &quot; I broke the windshield . . . . It ' s mine . . . . There ' s no trouble here , &quot; according to Fuhrman ' s letter . When he testified during the preliminary hearing in the current case , Fuhrman said he had been to the Hall of Famer ' s house in 1985 , but he was not asked to elaborate . The 1989 letter was apparently written at the request of the city attorney ' s office , which was then preparing a case against Simpson in connection with a Jan . 1 , 1989 , allegation of abuse -- one to which he eventually pleaded no contest . &quot; It seems odd to remember such an event , but it is not every day that you respond to a celebrity ' s home for a family dispute , &quot; Fuhrman concluded in his letter . &quot; For this reason this incident was indelibly pressed in my memory. &quot; Because the letter indicates that Fuhrman knew of Simpson ' s troubled relationship with his ex-wife , it could help defense_attorneys who tried during the preliminary hearing to show that detectives believed Simpson was a suspect when they went_to his home . Fuhrman and the other LAPD detectives said they did not suspect Simpson at that time but merely went_to his home to tell him that his ex-wife had been killed and that his children were at the police_station . Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of Simpson ' s attorneys , said the Fuhrman letter raises questions about whether the detective was lying when he said he did not consider Simpson a suspect when he and other investigators went_to Simpson ' s estate hours after the murders . &quot; Believe you me , I think you ' ll find that we will be pursuing that , &quot; Cochran said Thursday . In addition to its formal discovery request , the defense also has made a lengthy informal discovery request to prosecutors . In it , Simpson ' s lead lawyer , Robert L . Shapiro , asked_for records of any statements made by police to Simpson or others to encourage the former Heisman Trophy winner to cooperate with authorities . That request seems to indicate that the defense may attempt to challenge the admissibility of a statement Simpson made to the police the day after the murders . In California , a section of the Penal Code delineates information that must be disclosed by the prosecution -- including statements made by defendants , all relevant evidence obtained as part of the investigation , the existence of a felony conviction of any key witness , experts ' reports and the results of scientific tests . The Brady doctrine applies not only to the conduct of attorneys , but also to police_officers and others working with them . For example , in 1992 , 17 years after being convicted of murdering a deputy_sheriff , two Los Angeles men -- Clarence Chance and Benny Powell -- were released from prison after investigators discovered that the two may have been framed by overzealous investigators for the Los Angeles Police_Department . Among other things , the investigators found that during a 1975 trial , the police had withheld from prosecutors and the defense information that a jailhouse informant who testified against Chance and Powell may have been lying and had implicated others in the crime . &quot; It was a classic Brady violation , &quot; said Los Angeles lawyer Sandra E . Smith , one of the attorneys for the pair . &quot; It ' s just as egregious to have exculpatory information withheld when the prosecuting attorneys don ' t know , as when they do. &quot; The Supreme Court decision involved John L . Brady , who was sentenced to death for robbery and murder . When he appealed , his lawyers found that prosecutors failed to disclose that an accomplice had confessed to the murder . Brady ' s conviction was upheld , but his death sentence was overturned . The basic standard that has evolved since Brady is that if the prosecution withholds information requested , a conviction must be reversed -- or a penalty annulled -- if the information is deemed &quot; material , &quot; meaning it might have affected the outcome of the trial . Interpretation of the word &quot; material &quot; is hotly debated , though . In September , 1990 , a Los Angeles federal judge dismissed payola and racketeering charges against record promoter Joseph Isgro of Glendale and two other men after learning that a veteran Justice_Department lawyer concealed information that cast serious doubts on the merits of the case . U.S. District Judge James M . Ideman ruled that a prosecutor had violated Isgro ' s rights by failing to disclose that a key witness had , in an earlier case , provided testimony that flatly contradicted his statements in the later case . An appeals court reversed Ideman , saying Isgro ' s rights had not been materially prejudiced because the information had been discovered before the witness testified and thus it could be used to impeach him . In the Simpson case , defense_attorneys contend that the prosecution ' s obligation is very broad and should include disclosure of information that has even the slightest potential of clearing Simpson . That is particularly important , the defense_team said , in a case where &quot; the prosecutor ( Marcia Clark ) has publicly committed herself very early in the investigation to a theory of the evidence which excludes the possibility of innocence , &quot; and therefore &quot; the exculpatory potential of evidentiary leads may be cursorily dismissed. &quot; Deputy Dist . Attys . Clark , William Hodgman and Cheri Lewis acknowledge in a response motion their duty to turn_over relevant , helpful information to Simpson . For example , they say &quot; if and when &quot; any fingerprints found at the crime scene are matched by computer , &quot; we will provide that information to the defense as soon as a match is made. &quot; But the prosecutors contend that the rest of the defense request is much too broad , is not specific enough and fails to provide legally adequate grounds for the material it seeks . In regard_to the request for information about &quot; similar murders &quot; the prosecutors ask , &quot; All double homicides ? All domestic violence murders ? &quot; And in_order to comply with the defense request for dog_bite records , the prosecutors said they would have to trample on the privacy rights of hospital patients . Moreover , Clark said , the California Supreme Court has ruled that there is &quot; no general duty on prosecutorial officials to serve as defense investigators. &quot; Loyola Law_School professor Laurie Levenson said that is a critical_point . &quot; While we consider it a fundamental requirement of due_process_of_law for the prosecutor to give the defendant information that would tend to exonerate him , that does not mean the prosecutor has to take_over the role of the defense_lawyer or one of his investigators. &quot; Indeed , numerous state and federal cases during the past 30 years have shown that the Brady decision does not require the disclosure of all evidence requested by the defendant , Levenson said . Cases have held that the government does not have to disclose speculative evidence , evidence available to the defense from other sources or evidence the prosecutor does not possess . Perhaps most significant is that prosecutors are not required to open their files for &quot; an open-ended fishing expedition , &quot; in search of Brady material , Levenson added . Several other legal_experts said they believed the defense request was too broad . Prominent defense_lawyer Harland W . Braun questioned the demand for information on the victims ' associates . &quot; that ' s too sweeping , &quot; Braun said . &quot; Does that mean reports on every person who worked_at Mezzaluna where Goldman was a waiter ? Does that mean reports on every person who worked_out at the gym Nicole went_to ? &quot; USC criminal_law professor Charles Weisselberg said several of the defense requests would have to be more narrowly tailored and buttressed by a theory about how the murders occurred to have a chance of success .
