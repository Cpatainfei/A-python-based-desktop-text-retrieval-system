   <HEADLINE> ANNUAL MUTUAL_FUND REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK ; SELECTION OF INVESTMENT ' HEDGES ' LOOKS A BIT SCRAWNY ; SAFEGUARDS : GOLD FUNDS PERFORMED WELL IN ' 93 , BUT QUESTION OF CONTINUED DEMAND CLOUDS FUTURE PERFORMANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With U.S. and global stock_markets at or near record highs , many investors are beginning to ask the simple question : What if things go_wrong when markets seem to be priced for everything going right ? That has sparked the search by some investors for a &quot; hedge &quot; -- an investment that might go_up , or hold steady , if stock funds suddenly go_down because of a jump in inflation and-or interest_rates , or some international calamity . The problem is that hedges are hard to find for small players . Gold funds were obviously a favorite hedge in 1993 . The average gold fund rocketed 80.9 % for the year , even though the price of gold bullion rose just 17 % . If inflation does surprise everyone in 1994 , gold will probably get an additional lift , says Victor Flores , manager of the United Services Gold Shares fund in San Antonio . Likewise , gold should benefit , at least temporarily , from any unforeseen international turmoil . But Flores said he believes gold bullion has been moving_up not on inflation fears , but on simple supply and demand : Third_World consumers and investors have been boosting their gold holdings ( often merely via jewelry purchases ) at a time when gold mine production has been waning worldwide . Thus , if demand should trail off , and inflation doesn ' t materialize as a major problem in the United States and Europe , Flores says , the gold-mining shares_in gold funds could be vulnerable . &quot; The stocks are expensive , but they ' ve been expensive all along , &quot; he says . He figures that North_American gold-mining shares ' prices now anticipate a gold price of about $ 450 an ounce , compared to the current price of about $ 394 . &quot; Either you get gold to that price or the stocks come_down , &quot; Flores says . Two other classic hedges , at least against inflation , are real_estate and commodities . While there are stock funds specializing in equities in those fields , their use as hedges is limited , experts say . Natural_resources funds , the category closest to qualifying as a commodity investment , are usually heavily invested in energy stocks . The problem there : While other commodity prices have been rising recently , oil ' s price has plunged . Likewise , real_estate funds could be helped if inflation returns and investors ' appetite for real assets surges . But higher inflation would also mean higher interest_rates . And many real_estate funds own real_estate investment_trust shares , which are viewed_as bond substitutes and thus get whacked when interest_rates jump . In short , for the average fund investor , there is no great universal hedge , says Michael Lipper of fund tracker Lipper Analytical . Except for plain old cash , that is . If you ' re really worried about stock prices , Lipper says , just cut_back somewhat on your stock funds and keep an above-average portion of your assets in money funds . Non-Gold Hedge_Funds ? Funds that specialize in natural_resources and real_estate might be ways to hedge against a return of inflation , but some experts say they ' re imperfect hedges at best .
