   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON TEAM TO FIGHT D.A. ' S USE OF GRAND_JURY AT HEARING ; COURTS : DEFENSE SAYS ANY EVIDENCE GATHERED BY PANEL SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED . EMBATTLED POLICE_DETECTIVE ASKS JUDGE TO DENY REQUEST FOR PERSONNEL RECORDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito on Thursday granted O.J. Simpson ' s lawyers an emergency hearing today in which they will try to block prosecutors from gathering more evidence against the former football great during a grand_jury inquiry of Simpson ' s longtime friend Al Cowlings . Meanwhile , a police_detective whom the defense has claimed is racist and possibly corrupt , fought_back Thursday by asking Ito to deny a defense request for his personnel records . Lawyers for Detective Mark Fuhrman are expected to argue that issue before Ito on Monday . At the closed emergency hearing this afternoon , Ito is expected to hear arguments on whether Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti is improperly using the grand_jury to glean information to further implicate Simpson in the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and Ronald Lyle Goldman . In court papers , the defense argues that Garcetti should be sanctioned because such use of a grand_jury is improper and that any evidence that the panel has produced against Simpson should be suppressed . The lawyers also asked that Ito dismiss the murder case against Simpson . The papers assert that the &quot; grand_jury is not empowered to conduct roving investigations , or assist the district_attorney in conducting his own roving investigations. &quot; The defense_team ' s constitutional expert , Gerald F . Uelmen , cites in the papers remarks Garcetti made Wednesday to reporters in which he said he was using the grand_jury for &quot; strictly investigatory purposes &quot; in the Cowlings case . Suzanne Childs , a spokeswoman for Garcetti , declined to comment on the defense contentions , saying &quot; we will respond in court. &quot; The grand_jury inquiry of Cowlings , Garcetti said Wednesday , is aimed at determining whether enough evidence exists to charge him with trying to help Simpson flee from police June 17 , the day that Simpson was to surrender to authorities on the murder_charges . Instead of turning himself in , Simpson and Cowlings fled from the Encino home of another Simpson friend , Robert Kardashian . Cowlings and Simpson later led authorities on a nationally televised chase in a white Ford Bronco before winding_up at Simpson ' s estate . The district_attorney ' s office last month declined to charge Cowlings with aiding a fleeing felon , but reserved the right to do so later . Donald Re , Cowlings ' lawyer , has said that if a grand_jury investigating Cowlings happens_upon evidence relevant to the Simpson case , the prosecutors could use it . On Thursday , Southwestern University School_of_Law professor Robert A . Pugsley agreed . Pugsley noted that Garcetti has said he wants to investigate not only Cowlings , but everyone who had been at Kardashian ' s house the day Simpson fled . That being the case , he said , &quot; the grand_jury can legitimately remain in session for as long as it takes_to follow up the necessary leads to see if there is any basis for indicting any of those other people. &quot; As the defense scrambled to block the prosecution ' s use of the grand_jury , Fuhrman sought to block the defense from gaining access to his Los Angeles Police_Department personnel records . The defense wants access to any documents involving citizens ' complaints against Fuhrman related to racial and other prejudices , falsifying evidence or civilian misconduct . The defense hopes to attack the credibility of the detective , who has testified that he found a bloody glove behind a guest house at O.J. Simpson ' s estate . That glove is an apparent match of a bloody glove found at the murder scene . Defense sources have been quoted as saying Fuhrman may have planted the glove on Simpson ' s property . Widespread media attention also has focused_on a 1989 interview that Fuhrman had with a psychiatrist in which he allegedly used a racial slur when referring to black people . Simpson ' s lawyers also have obtained an affidavit from a woman who said Fuhrman once made derogatory remarks to her about interracial couples and black people in_general , an allegation that Fuhrman has denied . The defense_lawyers also cite a lawsuit in which a man contends that Fuhrman in 1987 took a knife from one location and placed it at his feet after Fuhrman and another officer shot him . In court papers filed Thursday , Robert H . Tourtelot , Fuhrman ' s lawyer , argued that the defense request for the personnel records is &quot; stuffed to the gills with irrelevant evidence that could only be calculated to harass Detective Fuhrman and taint potential jurors. &quot; Simpson ' s lawyers do not begin to establish a link between any alleged improper conduct by Fuhrman and the personnel records they seek , Tourtelot said . In another development Thursday , a woman who spoke_to Simpson ' s house_guest Brian ( Kato ) Kaelin the night Nicole Simpson and Goldman were killed disputed a magazine_article suggesting that she and Kaelin may have perjured themselves during court testimony . Rachel Ferrara labeled as false an Aug . 29 Time magazine_article that said she had told friends that Kaelin saw Simpson outside his guest house moments after Kaelin was startled by a loud_noise at the rear of the structure . The bloody glove was later found near the spot where the noise originated . If Time ' s account were true , prosecutors could place Simpson in the area where the glove was found . Ferrara insisted that the magazine is wrong . A Time spokesman contacted Thursday stood_by the article . Times staff writer Robert Lopez contributed to this story .</TEXT>
