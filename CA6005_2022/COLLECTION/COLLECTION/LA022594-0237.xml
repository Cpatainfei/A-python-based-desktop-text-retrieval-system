   <HEADLINE> INSURANCE_FIRMS WIN REVIEW ON ROLLBACK ; COURTS : EX-GOV . DEUKMEJIAN , ARGUING BEFORE JUSTICES HE APPOINTED , PERSUADES PANEL TO TAKE_UP ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE MANDATES FOR CONSUMER RATE RELIEF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the urging of former Gov . George Deukmejian and the insurance industry , the California Supreme Court agreed Thursday to review a case that tests the Legislature ' s ability to exempt certain insurance_companies from voter-approved rate rollbacks . Deukmejian , who appointed most of the court ' s justices , urged them to review the case on behalf of a surety insurance_company whose owner contributed heavily to his political_campaigns . The company wants the high_court to overturn a lower court decision striking down a state law exempting part of the insurance industry from the rollbacks imposed by Proposition 103 . Insurance reform advocates contend that four of the six Supreme Court justices have a conflict_of_interest in the case because Deukmejian appointed them . Chief_Justice Malcolm Lucas is a former law partner of Deukmejian , and Justice Marvin Baxter served as his appointments secretary . The seventh seat on the high_court has been vacant since Justice Edward Panelli retired earlier this year . &quot; I think it is gravely disturbing that the insurance industry was able to convince the court to take this case by using the influence of the governor who appointed a majority of the court , &quot; said Harvey Rosenfield , the chief author of Proposition 103 . Rosenfield said his group , the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project , is considering &quot; options &quot; to ensure the case gets an impartial review . &quot; I think the public is going_to be revolted by this , &quot; he said . Voting to review the case were Justices Lucas , Baxter , Joyce Kennard , Armand Arabian -- all Deukmejian appointees -- and Justice Ronald George , who was appointed by Gov . Pete Wilson . Deukmejian represents Northridge-based Surety Co . of the Pacific , which is supporting the main litigant in the case , Amwest Surety Insurance Co . Neither Deukmejian nor Surety Co . could be reached for comment . The high_court will review a 2-1 decision by a Court of Appeal striking down a 1990 state law , signed by Deukmejian , that exempts surety companies from the rollbacks required by the 1988 insurance initiative . Surety companies provide bonds to contractors , movie studios and others so they can guarantee that their projects will be completed . The surety industry could be liable for as much as $ 100 million in rebates . A spokeswoman for the high_court , asked about a potential conflict_of_interest , noted that the governor has been a principle litigant in other cases before it . She said the court has no official comment on the conflict-of-interest charge .</TEXT>
