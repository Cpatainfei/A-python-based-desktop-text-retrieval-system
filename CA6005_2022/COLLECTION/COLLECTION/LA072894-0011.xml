   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON AFRICA ; CHARITY AND PEACE BEGIN AT_HOME ; AFRICANS WANT AN END TO THE CRISES INFLICTED BY AND ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE . HOW TO HELP ? STOP AID TO MILITARY REGIMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rwanda evokes visceral reaction from Africans living here in the United States . &quot; I don ' t want to think_about it ; it ' s a disgrace to Africa and it ' s too close to home , &quot; says Anita Shirima , a graduate_student from Tanzania . &quot; Rwanda is one more proof that the military is out of control in Africa , &quot; declares Reminglus Kintu , president of Uganda Democratic Coalition . &quot; The complicity of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni should not be overlooked in the Rwandan crisis , &quot; he adds . &quot; Where is the Organization of African Unity ? What are African governments doing to resolve the Rwandan crisis ? &quot; asks Jide Osikomalya , the Nigerian publisher of Africa Forum . Well , the OAU and African governments did something . At the OAU ' s 30th summit in Tunis on June 15 , Secretary-general Salim Ahmad Salim declared : &quot; Africa must assume its responsibility. &quot; Indeed , it produced a cease-fire agreement between Rwandan warring factions that bore no signatures . It also appointed -- of all people ! -- President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as the mediator . Zaire itself is_on the brink of total collapse , wracked by civil strife and carnage . Virtually all formal institutions in Zaire have crumbled . Unpaid Zairean soldiers have been rampaging and pillaging villages . The business_communities in Kivu and Lower Zaire decided to pay the salaries of soldiers there to prevent further looting . Zairean soldiers have even been robbing the Rwandan refugees encamped at Goma . The frustrations of Africans over the hopeless incompetence of the OAU and African governments on Rwanda seldom receive play in the Western media , which prefers quoting politicians ' trite alibis for African inaction and gratuitous blaming of the United Nations and the U.S._government for acting too slowly . But most Africans are tired_of these crises , the incessant blame and &quot; parachute journalism. &quot; Year after year since 1985 , Western journalists have hopped from one African debacle to another , parading grisly pictures of emaciated bodies of famine victims on television to appeal for humanitarian assistance : Ethiopia ( 1985 ) , Angola ( 1986 ) , Mozambique ( 1987 ) , Sudan ( 1991 ) , Liberia ( 1992 ) , Somalia ( 1993 ) , Rwanda ( 1994 ) . Many Africans are enraged by television images that deprecate their pride and dignity . Africa , it seems , is synonymous with famine , death and destruction . The horrific pictures also convey the mischievous notion that Africans are incapable of feeding themselves or solving their own problems . With a bowl in an outstretched hand , they are always begging foreigners for food . The responsibility for feeding Africans rests with African governments , not foreigners . Yet every year there is a fete of massive relief for Africa . Back in 1985 , it was Band_Aid for Ethiopia and U.S.A. for Africa at a cost of over $ 1.6 billion . In 1992 , it was &quot; Operation Rescue &quot; for Somalia , costing more_than $ 2.6 billion . The Rwandan mission has passed the $ 250-million mark . And more African_countries are standing_in line , ready to blow_up . The United Nations Development Program has targeted 10 on the brink of social disintegration : Algeria , Angola , Burundi , Egypt , Liberia , Mozambique , Nigeria , Sudan , Zaire and , of course , Rwanda . It would make more sense to spend a little money now to help prevent these crises , rather than waiting for them to explode , sending refugees streaming in all directions . Refugees and famine victims must be helped ; it is humanitarian and noble to do so . But African humanitarian relief should be coupled with a search for permanent solutions , or at least acknowledge the efforts that Africans themselves are making to find such solutions . Racism , colonial borders and legacies , American imperialism , the Cold_War and ancient tribal rivalries are irrelevant in the analyses of these crises . Take Ethiopia , Liberia , Nigeria , Rwanda , Somalia and Sudan : All have been devastated by the adamant refusal of military coconut-heads to step_down or share political power . Africa has too many dictators -- more per capita than any other region in the world . Only 13 of the 54 African_countries are democratic . The least the international community could do to help Africa find permanent solutions to its crises is to aid only democratic countries and deny aid to any African_country that spends more_than 5 % of its government budget on the military . ( African governments spend more_than $ 12 billion a year on the importation of arms and the maintenance of the military -- an amount equal_to what Africa receives in aid from all sources. ) On Rwanda , it is tempting for the international community , anguishing over the bloodletting and embarrassed by its apparent helplessness to halt the slaughter , to embrace and recognize the government formed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front . This government , boasts RPF leader Paul Kagame , is &quot; broad-based , &quot; with two moderate Hutus , Faustin Twagiramugu and Pasteur Bizimungu , as prime_minister and president . Although the RPF earned distinction by its remarkable display of discipline in battle and committed fewer atrocities , an RPF government is not viable . First of all , recognizing a group that shoots its way to power undermines the ideals of democracy that most seek to establish elsewhere in Africa . Furthermore , Africa ' s protracted experience with civil_wars shows that a vanquished faction simply does not evaporate . It flees into exile , regroups and returns with a vengeance to wreak mayhem . Says Labislas Habyatinana , a defeated Hutu soldier who fled to Munigi , Zaire : &quot; I ' ve killed at least 80 Tutsis with grenades . . . . I ' m still young , I can fight again soon , then again and again until we win_back Rwanda. &quot; This is exactly what the Tutsi rebels did , fleeing into exile after being routed in 1959 . Despite assurances by the RPF that it will not seek revenge against the Hutus , it is unlikely that the 3 million Hutu refugees in Tanzania and Zaire will return anytime soon to Rwanda . Africa is a place where promises by governments have as much value as a 5-million Zaire note -- less than a cent . Rather than leave it to suffer the fate of Somalia -- abandoned to the whims of armed vultures -- Rwanda should be recolonized from within Africa . An interim , two-year transitional multinational government should be established , with representatives drawn not only from the remaining Hutu and Tutsi populations but also from groups organized along class , economic and religious lines to weaken the ethnic factor_in government . The Rwandan military should be disbanded . And neighboring countries -- Burundi , Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda and Zaire -- should have seats in the interim government , with the right to veto legislation . The neighboring countries , after all , have received huge numbers of Rwandan refugees , putting a severe strain on their meager social_services . As such , they ought to have a say in the internal affairs of Rwanda . But there is a more cogent reason for the involvement of neighboring countries : Their own domestic situations mirror those of Rwanda . Burundi , Kenya , Uganda and Zaire are themselves sitting on the keg of ethnic explosion . An involvement in Rwanda may have a deterrent or therapeutic effect by impressing upon its neighbors the ravages of unremitting civil strife . It is time to send a strong message to African governments : If they do not handle their internal affairs well , they will be recolonized or invaded by their neighbors . Perhaps the United Nations could take the lead instead of the OAU and establish an African-administered trusteeship over Rwanda and Somalia . Admittedly , this proposal is not fail-proof . But as a Tanzanian proverb advises : &quot; We start as fools and become wise through experience. &quot; Making excuses for the OAU and African governments hardly gives them the incentive to make a start .</TEXT>
