   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; HONG KONG MOVIE COMPANY ' S IPO DRAWS INVESTOR GOLD_RUSH ; FILM : MOGUL RAYMOND CHOW RAISES $ 29 MILLION IN THE OFFERING FOR GOLDEN HARVEST ENTERTAINMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Raymond Chow is too modest a man to say so himself , but he has lots to boast about these days . The man who introduced kung_fu star Bruce Lee to America and transformed Jackie Chan from an actresses ' stunt double to a millionaire martial_arts performer has another hit . The initial_public_offering of stock in Chow ' s Golden Harvest Entertainment Ltd . was a smash last week , with many eager investors shut_out as the offering was 52 times oversubscribed . Chow raised $ 29 million in the offering . Investors are expected to quickly bid up the stock ' s 25 cents-per-share offering price when trading begins on the Hong Kong Stock_Exchange next week . The stock is popular because Golden Harvest is_well positioned to sate Asia ' s hunger for entertainment . In this fast-developing region , a movie ticket is something most people can afford , and despite the growth of cable and satellite TV , the theater provides an escape_from crowded households and steamy weather . Hong Kongers see almost as_many movies as Americans -- at least six a year -- and cinemas in Golden Harvest ' s key markets of Singapore and Malaysia are in the world ' s Top 10 moneymakers per screen . &quot; If you believe that the leisure sector is going_to take_off in Asia , this is the sort of company you want to bet_on , &quot; says Nikhil Srinivasan , a vice_president at Baring Securities in Hong Kong . Analysts give the company good ratings for its regional network , established reputation and exclusive distribution_agreements with several of Hollywood ' s major studios . Movie moguls in Hong Kong only half-jokingly refer to the territory as &quot; Hollywood East. &quot; Hong Kong holds second place in the world for movie exports , and it cranked_out 276 films for domestic distribution last year . Golden Harvest controls more_than a quarter of the market . The company boasts the kind of vertical_integration that American studios grudgingly gave_up in the 1920s and 1930s because of antitrust regulations . Different arms of the company produce films , then distribute them to company-owned theaters . Golden Harvest also handles distribution in Hong Kong and Vietnam for Universal Studios , MGM and Paramount , whose movies make_up a third of Hong Kong ' s foreign film market . &quot; There just isn ' t any other large-scale , well-organized film distribution company with a regional network , &quot; Chow says . The closest competitor is Shaw Bros. , which Chow worked for until he broke_loose in 1970 to found the tiny family-owned company that has become a regional powerhouse . Chow , the 67-year-old chairman of Golden Harvest , learned from Bruce Lee how to break boards with his feet . It takes that kind of finesse and tenacity to establish a pan-Asian network -- and to deal with its pitfalls , from piracy to government monopolies and censorship . Golden Harvest plans to use most of the money raised in the initial_offering to build more multiscreen theaters in Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Vietnam and someday China . China ' s 1.2 billion people may represent the biggest potential audience , but the nation also represents the biggest challenge because of government control . It is also among the most risky for piracy . Theaters in Chinese cities will split a cinema in half , show a government-sanctioned film on one side and a pirated laser disc on the other . &quot; It ' s multiplex in its crudest form , &quot; says Steve Stine , an analyst for Kagan World Media . Golden Harvest and Time Warner are the only foreign companies allowed_in China . The terms are strict , and profits are &quot; nothing to brag about , &quot; Chow says . Though Chow doesn ' t shy_away_from any particular pictures , he says his people know how to pick what will be popular and how to anticipate problems . &quot; I don ' t believe_in slipping politics into films , &quot; says Chow , noting that the American government ' s hands-off policy has resulted in some of the world ' s best movies . Golden Harvest distributes some American record setters such_as Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; but overall , Chinese-language movies are the most popular . Action comedies with titles such_as &quot; Drunken Master &quot; &quot; Justice , My Foot &quot; and &quot; Fight_Back to School &quot; beat_out American hits like &quot; Terminator II &quot; and &quot; Basic Instinct. &quot; For now , Golden Harvest is keeping the volatile film production arm and its coveted Chinese movie library private .</TEXT>
