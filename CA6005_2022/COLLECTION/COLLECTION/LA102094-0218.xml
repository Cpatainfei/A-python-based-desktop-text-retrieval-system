   <HEADLINE> FASHION / INSIDE OUT : DESIGNER ' S DAYTIME LOOK HAS THAT FREUDIAN TOUCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> British designer Bella Freud , whose father is artist Lucien Freud and whose grandfather was Sigmund Freud , popped_up here after her London show to interest buyers in her spring collection . We would n ' t have even seen Freud had we not been prowling the corridors of our idiosyncratic-but-well-located hotel in search of junk food . A sign led us to a tiny room where four rolling racks of polished , youthful suits and dressy tops caught our eye . Freud , who for years worked as Vivienne Westwood ' s assistant , said she designs dressy daytime looks_for a fantasy girl &quot; who ' s a little wild. &quot; Fantasy has replaced Freud ' s original fashion heroine , Claudine , from the Colette books . Asked about her line ' s label , which bears a drawing of a silly dog whose tongue hangs_out , she said matter-of-factly : &quot; My dad did_it . He ' s kind of handy that way. &quot; * Fun Couple : Model Janice Dickinson and Vogue publisher Ronald A . Galotti were gushing over each other here as she taped a fashion segment for TV ' s &quot; American Journal. &quot; &quot; This is college for me , &quot; she said , sprawling at the end of the runway where the Hermes show had just taken_place . Post-graduate work , said the dark-haired beauty and former Sly Stallone flame , will be hosting a style show on the Disney Channel . &quot; I ' m gonna put Minnie Mouse in Lagerfeld , &quot; she boasted . ( Hadn ' t &quot; the Kaiser &quot; dreamed_up Miss Mouse ' s cartooney get-up in the first place ? ) Dickinson admitted that covering the fashion shows made her nostalgic for the runway . &quot; But more_than modeling , I miss that time of my life. &quot; We , too , yearn for those madcap days of yore . * Young Blood : What are the signs that a young designer ' s star is ascending ? In the case of John Rochas , there are quite a_few . Director Jim Sheridan ( &quot; The Commitments &quot; ) was in the audience of Rochas ' Paris debut last week , working_on a documentary about the designer . And singer Sinead O ' Connor took_to the runway to model the clothes . Ah , the luck of the_Irish . * Missing in Action : Black models fairly dominated the runways in the mid- ' 80s , but the list of well-known names who worked this season ' s Paris shows was short : Tyra , Naomi Campbell , Beverly Peele , Brandi and Chrystele . Has the influx of Eastern European talent driven_away models of color ? Or were they discouraged by fashion ' s short-lived fascination with waifs ? More important , will the dearth continue at the American designer shows in New York at month ' s end ? We hope not . * Meanwhile , Back in L.A. : We battle sluggishness with toxic chemicals like caffeine and sugar , but Evelyn Lauder ' s Rx for superhuman energy is a health drink made of low-fat yogurt , bananas , strawberries and carrot_juice . At a press breakfast last week for the cosmetics exec ' s landscape photography book , &quot; The Seasons Observed , &quot; she directed the Four Seasons ' kitchen to make_up enough for everyone , whether they needed it or not . She certainly did -- with just 24 hours to spend in L.A. last week , Estee ' s daughter-in-law squeezed in a cocktail_party , TV appearance , press breakfast and book signings at Neiman Marcus and Bullock ' s . ( Her book royalties go_to the Breast_Cancer Research Foundation. ) This left barely enough time for her to reapply her persimmon lipstick , which matched her Chanel boucle jacket , before racing off to do more of the same in Santa Barbara . * Party Animals : Rodeo Drive was crawling with party hoppers Thursday night on the stretch between Gucci and Fred . Gucci ' s benefit for the California State Summer School for the Arts was co-hosted by Kelsey Grammer and Peri Gilpin of &quot; Frasier. &quot; &quot; ( The character ) Daphne and I aspire to Gucci , &quot; said Gilpin , who plays Roz . &quot; Frasier would wear it , but Niles would n ' t -- it ' d be too risque for him. &quot; Grammer , though , begged to differ : &quot; If you lowered the price , either brother would wear it. &quot; This particular evening he settled for a tweedy blazer , boldly patterned cafe shirt , black jeans and cowboy_boots . . . . Over at Fred Joaillier , real diamonds ( to the tune of millions of dollars ) were under glass , while cubic zirconias filled Absolut vodka bottles during an exhibition of the 40th Annual Diamonds-International Awards Collection . Everyone knows -- or at least we do now -- that you can ' t put cut diamonds together in a jar without scratching them . &quot; Only other diamonds cut diamonds , &quot; says the Diamond Information Center ' s Cri Cri Solak-Eastin , who modeled Japanese winner Yuko Nakajima ' s autumn leaf brooch made of acrylic , platinum and 427 diamonds . Actress Faith Ford wore American designer Janis Savitt ' s leather and platinum choker set with five pear-shaped and 66 square-cut diamonds . The award winners used more_than 790 carats worth of diamonds , and the event raised thousands of dollars for AIDS Project Los Angeles . * Cable News Time : Sculptor / jeweler David Yurman stopped by Neiman Marcus last week for a 10-year retrospective of his work and prototypes of his new cable watch collection -- or &quot; bracelets that tick , &quot; as he likes to call them . They ' re to be worn with his popular cable bracelets . While in town , the designer -- who apprenticed 30 years ago with artist Jacques Lipchitz ( whose sculpture tops the Music Center ' s plaza fountain ) -- told of his Angst over moving from fine_art into jewelry . &quot; I went_to an analyst for five years to get_over my fear of setting stones. &quot; * Inside Out is published Thursdays .</TEXT>
