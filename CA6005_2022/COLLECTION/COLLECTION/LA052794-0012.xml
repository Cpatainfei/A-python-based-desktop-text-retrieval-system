   <HEADLINE> A SERVING OF JUSTICE AT DENNY ' S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unprecedented legal agreement , African American customers who were refused service , asked to pay in_advance , seated in segregated areas or subjected_to other hostile treatment because of their race will share_in a $ 54-million settlement from Denny ' s , the restaurant_chain . That is the largest nationwide settlement in any public accommodations case since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . &quot; These settlements . . . put corporate America on notice that discrimination in public places will be just as costly as discrimination in housing and discrimination in employment , &quot; Deval Patrick , the new head of the Justice_Department ' s Civil Rights Division said . He said the department is investigating 20 such cases . Denny ' s admits no wrongdoing , but attorneys who initiated class-action lawsuits against Denny ' s , including some from the Public Interest Law_Firm in San Jose , cited many examples . The most notorious incident involved six black Secret_Service agents who were refused service for nearly an hour at a Denny ' s in Annapolis , Md . They were in that state to provide security during a visit by President Clinton . While they were forced to wait , 14 white agents and a black agent who sat with them were quickly served . The Annapolis incident happened on the very day that a federal judge in California ordered Denny ' s to stop discriminating against black customers . That case started when 18 black high_school and college_students who had attended an NAACP college information program went_to a Denny ' s restaurant in San Jose and were required to prepay for meals or pay a cover_charge before they were seated . That incident led to a class-action suit alleging 3 # 000 racial incidents at Denny ' s restaurants in Los Angeles , Costa Mesa , San Diego , Sacramento and elsewhere in California . Denny ' s has also agreed to hire a civil_rights monitor , retrain all its employees , run racially diverse advertisements and conduct random tests for discrimination at its restaurants . Racial discrimination in public places has long been against the law . But laws are meaningless without strong enforcement . The Denny ' s settlement is a welcome sign that Washington once again intends to vigorously enforce civil_rights laws .</TEXT>
