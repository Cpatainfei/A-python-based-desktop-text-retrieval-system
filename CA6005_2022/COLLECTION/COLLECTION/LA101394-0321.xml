   <HEADLINE> RECORD CROPS FORECAST FOR CORN , SOYBEANS ; AGRICULTURE : THE GOVERNMENT PREDICTS A STUNNING REBOUND FROM 1993 ' S FLOODS AND DROUGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s farmers are posting a stunning recovery from last year ' s floods and drought , harvesting record crops of corn and soybeans . The U.S. Agriculture_Department on Wednesday forecast the corn harvest at 9.6 billion bushels and soybeans at 2.46 billion bushels . Nearly ideal weather throughout the Midwest caused both crops to mature early and stay hardy . The bumper crops will knock_down prices received by farmers , raising the prospect of higher government spending to maintain farm income . But the bulging bins should have no major effect on consumer prices , because raw goods make_up such a small part of retail prices . By keeping a lid on animal feed costs , the heavy harvest should hold_down already-low meat prices , said Paul T . Prentice , president of Farm Sector Economics in Colorado Springs , Colo . Despite the gloomier price picture , some growers are pleased at the bounty . &quot; It gives you a good feeling to know you ' ve got a good crop_out there , &quot; said Scott Durbin , who grows corn and soybeans on 750 acres near Owaneco in south-central Illinois . &quot; It may_not be worth what you ' d like for it to be , but at least , by golly , you ' re going to have a crop_out there to harvest. &quot; Durbin was reporting some corn yields in excess of 200 bushels an acre and soybeans at 50 bushels or more . Yields like that in a major growing state such_as Illinois helped push the nation ' s forecast yields to a record 133.8 bushels of corn per acre and 40.5 bushels for soybeans . In parts of the Corn_Belt , some grain was already being piled on the ground because elevators are_full to bursting , said Rod Gangwish , a Shelton , Neb. , farmer and president of the National Corn Growers Assn . But the self-professed optimist says it ' s often better to have more to sell cheap than too_little at a higher price . Wednesday ' s report , based on Oct . 1 field conditions , marks the second straight month the department has raised its forecast . Harvest is still under way for both crops . The previous record corn crop was 9.48 billion bushels in 1992 . For soybeans , the record was 2.26 billion bushels in 1979 .</TEXT>
