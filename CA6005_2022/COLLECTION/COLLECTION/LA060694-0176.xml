   <HEADLINE> METHODS TO FIX HIGH-RISE STEEL FAIL STRESS_TESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Costly retrofitting methods already being used to fix steel-frame buildings cracked in the Northridge earthquake have failed strength tests , leaving officials baffled about how to mend broken welds and beams in dozens of Los Angeles high-rises . Tests conducted at the University of Texas at Austin found that the repair methods recommended by Los Angeles city building officials failed when subjected_to simulated 7.0 magnitude earthquakes , researchers said over the weekend . The connections broke easily and were only one-sixth to one-third as strong and flexible as they should be , they said . &quot; There are some very fundamental things here that we don ' t appear to understand , &quot; said University of Texas professor Michael D . Engelhardt , a leading steel expert who conducted the study for the American Institute of Steel Construction . &quot; We can now report what doesn ' t work . &quot; But we still don ' t know what does_work , &quot; he said . &quot; Even with improvements , there were cracks early on in the tests . It ' s very discouraging. &quot; The test results were so poor , he said , that five remaining simulations have been halted . The initial results will be presented to Los Angeles building officials today , so they can discuss other possible retrofitting methods . Steel-frame mid- and high-rise office_buildings , designed to bend with enormous earthquake forces without breaking , were considered among the safest to ride_out an earthquake . None of these modern buildings came_close to collapse in the Jan . 17 quake , engineers said . But in a development that rattled experts , widespread cracking has been discovered in the welded connections of the beams and columns of at least 90 buildings , most in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside . Up to 90 % of the connections in some buildings cracked . Results from the Texas tests -- the main effort to find a solution to the problem -- are of particular concern because the welding methods and design changes tested are currently being used in the city ' s high-rises . Officials are requiring their use in the retrofitting of quake-damaged buildings and in new construction . &quot; Construction is going_on with processes that may_not work , &quot; said Los Angeles structural engineer Thomas Sabol , who serves on the city panel studying the problem with steel-frame buildings . &quot; They are wasting their money. &quot; Such retrofits cost $ 800 to $ 2 # 000 per joint , so repairs could run_into the millions of dollars in large buildings with hundreds of cracked joints . The owners of 30 steel-frame commercial buildings already have taken_out permits to conduct repairs , and about half of the repairs have been completed , said Richard Holguin , assistant chief of the city ' s building bureau . The city ' s recommendations to steel-frame building owners after the Northridge quake were based on engineering simulations conducted before the temblor . These showed that joints reinforced in certain ways -- usually with steel_plates -- performed better than those built to the current code . &quot; It appears that the fixes we have been proposing do not seem to work , &quot; Holguin said . &quot; We ' re not sure what the next step is . At this point , we don ' t have a clue. &quot; U.S. Borax Inc. is completing repairs on its four-story headquarters in Valencia , where 80 % of the 700 building connections cracked or were damaged . The tab : $ 5 million . Reconstruction supervisor Andrew Lisowski said the company used several retrofitting techniques in consultation with experts and conducted its own stress_tests to find a solution . &quot; I don ' t think we will have to redo this , &quot; he said . Like many other businesses with cracked steel-frame buildings , U.S. Borax has had to operate in temporary quarters . The company has temporarily dispatched staff to work in offices from Wilmington to London . Previous city building_codes were based largely on specifications recommended by the Structural Engineering Assn . of California . Derived from the best available earthquake simulation test data and engineering calculations , these specifications were thought to be rigorous enough so that steel-frame buildings might sustain structural damage in the largest expected earthquake , but never collapse . Some engineers now believe , however , that those tests may have been based on an underestimation of how flexible the building joints really are . The Texas tests sought to measure how far steel could be stressed without snapping . Life-sized columns and horizontal beams were welded together in California . Then the mock-ups were shipped to the University of Texas , where a hydraulic arm was used to shake the beam up and down , simulating an earthquake . The steel frames were strengthened in various ways . Welds were reinforced . Previously bolted parts were welded . And the connections were buttressed by additional steel_plates welded to the top and bottom of beams . Nonetheless , some connections broke after the beam had been shaken_up and down just once . &quot; It just snapped . This was nothing less than shocking , &quot; said Engelhardt , adding that such connections had held_up in previous , less sophisticated tests . Researchers , Engelhardt added , have not even begun examining why in some buildings the steel columns themselves cracked . &quot; Finding answers to all this could take some time , &quot; he said . Engineers and city officials are still unclear as_to what magnitude earthquake it takes_for the connections to crack . But some say further study is needed to determine whether a limited number of these buildings could collapse in an earthquake stronger and longer-lasting than the Northridge temblor . But engineers can point to only one steel-frame building that has collapsed in an earthquake -- in Mexico_City -- and they emphasized that even now steel-frame buildings are considered safer in an earthquake than non-ductile , or brittle , concrete buildings . Manufacturers of steel-frame homes say they have not had problems with connections cracking . Cracks in the steel frames of government and commercial buildings occurred as far from the epicenter of the Northridge quake as East Los Angeles . City officials estimate that nearly a quarter of the 400 steel-frame buildings in the Valley and Westside were affected . The tallest is an unidentified 23-story tower in the Valley , which is unoccupied . City officials have been urging the owners of steel-frame buildings to conduct inspections for cracks . They also are pushing a proposal , now before the City_Council , that would require inspections of the steel-frame buildings in the Valley and on the Westside . The California Seismic Safety Commission in April issued a public advisory about steel-frame office_buildings , urging that owners who observed even cosmetic damage to their buildings have them inspected by engineers and other experts . &quot; I really don ' t have any instinct on how to solve this . This is a puzzle to us , &quot; said Paul Fratessa , an Oakland structural engineer and member of the seismic commission . &quot; I still have a lot of confidence in steel , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m not panicked , but I am concerned that we move rapidly to get an answer. &quot;</TEXT>
