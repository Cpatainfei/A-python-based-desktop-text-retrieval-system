Forgetting the mechanical check Americans in near-record numbers are expected to visit auto showrooms this car-buying season to replace aging vehicles that have limped through the recession . J.D. Power Associates , the automotive research firm , estimates that more_than 15.5 million cars will change hands this year . That would make 1994 second in car sales to 1986 , when 16 million cars were sold . If you ' re among the recovery-charged car-buying masses , the good news and bad news can be compressed into one simple sentence : Buying a car hasn ' t changed much over the years . Aside from a_few dealerships -- mostly those selling Saturns -- where haggling over prices is out , getting a good_deal on a car still boils_down to the ancient art of negotiation . If you ' re a good bargainer , you can save thousands of dollars , but if you fall_into one of several car-buying traps , you will pay dearly . Here are 10 of the most costly pitfalls : 1 . Not knowing the dealer ' s price The starting point of any price negotiation should be what the car actually cost the dealership . Generally , that cost bears no relation_to the sticker price on the window . How do you learn the dealer ' s price ? There are essentially two sources : The Kelly Blue_Book or a service , such_as Consumer Reports ' New Car Price Service . The advantage of the Blue_Book is that it is comprehensive and can usually be found in any public_library . You can check the invoice prices of several cars all at once -- and all for free . The Consumer Reports service , on the other hand , costs roughly $ 10 a car . ( The price drops if you order reports on several cars. ) What this service has that the Blue_Book doesn ' t are tips on dealing with the dealers and information on factory rebates . These rebates , which can range from a_few hundred dollars to several thousand , in_effect lower the dealer ' s cost below his invoice price . The Consumer Reports package also includes information about the costs and advisability of various factory options and option packages . The service can be reached at ( 800 ) 933-5555 . A number of organizations , such_as auto clubs and credit_unions , offer similar services , but they may be available only to members . 2 . Getting pushed into a lease A lease can be great if you ' re the right type of driver -- someone who drives only late-model cars , doesn ' t drive a lot and is good at math . If you drive cars until they expire , drive more_than 15 # 000 miles a year and don ' t have a present-value calculator -- or a clue as_to how one works -- leasing could cost you a fortune . Nonetheless , leases are popular . They accounted_for roughly 25 % of the new-car turnover in 1993 . Customers are lured into them by the promise of low monthly payments , but many buyers don ' t realize that there are several other balls in the air -- among them financing costs , mileage limits , wear_and_tear on the car , the lease term , the &quot; residual &quot; ( the amount you ' d pay to buy the car at the end of the lease ) and the down_payment , usually called a &quot; capital reduction. &quot; And leasing companies often require you to buy high-coverage auto insurance , which can add hundreds of dollars to the annual cost of the car . ( See Trap No . 6. ) Keeping your eye on all these variables can be difficult if you ' re not exceptionally well-prepared when you walk into the dealership . And unless you ' re planning to lease when you walk in , you ' re unlikely to be prepared . If you plan to buy , don ' t get sidetracked into a lease . If you plan to lease , brush_up on your algebra . You ' ll need it . 3 . Negotiating car price and financing in one package Unless you ' ve got a lot of cash , you ' re going to need to finance the car , either through the dealer or a financial_institution . Shopping for auto loan rates can be as easy as checking the newspaper , but many people fail to do_it before they car-shop . The end result is they get snookered . How ? &quot; You want a lower price ? Sure , &quot; the dealer says . &quot; I ' ll give you this $ 8 # 000 car for $ 7 # 000 , with 12 % financing over five years. &quot; A great_deal ? Not really . Assuming you ' re a good credit risk , market auto loan rates are currently in the 8 % range . That higher dealer interest_rate would eat_up any &quot; savings &quot; on the sale price . In this case , the dealer ' s deal would cost you about $ 156 a month , or $ 9 # 360 over the five years , not including tax or license fees . What if you say , &quot; I ' ll take the $ 7 # 000 price , but I ' ll get my financing elsewhere ? &quot; At an 8 % rate , you ' d pay $ 142 a month , or $ 8 # 520 over the life of the loan . This isn ' t to say that dealers always offer bad financing rates . On the contrary , sometimes you can get a great_deal with dealer financing , but you should first negotiate the car ' s price . Then negotiate the financing separately . Wrapping them together can obscure the price of one or the other , and that can cost you . 4 . Shopping in the showroom You need a new car . You want it to be red . But the model ? Not so sure . So you decide to visit a_few dealerships and shop -- just as you would for electronics or shoes . Big mistake , says Harry Snyder , co-director of Consumers Union ' s San Francisco office . A car is the average consumer ' s second-biggest lifetime purchase , following only a house , he notes , and the transaction therefore warrants preparation . Luckily , there ' s plenty of material to help you prepare . Consumer Reports ' April car-buying issue or its annual Car Buying Guide , both available in public_libraries , can get you started . And as long as you ' re in the library , consult the newspaper files or on-line services for articles reporting J.D. Power ' s customer satisfaction ratings for various makes and models . All this reading has two points . First , it helps you determine which cars have good track records , reasonable repair and maintenance costs and hold_up well in a crash . Second , your research can help clarify what kind of car you really need . Is it a family car ? A pleasure vehicle ? How will it serve your driving needs and patterns ? That shiny two-door sedan may look great in the showroom and on the freeway , but it would be a curse with a passenger and a child seat -- or when it was your turn_to ferry around the Little_League team . Buyer remorse tends to hit in the weeks following delivery , says Larry Peterson , president of Consumer Automotive Resource Services in Eugene , Ore . By then , your new car is a used car , worth thousands of dollars less than what you paid_for it . Choose a_few likely models first . Then head to the showroom for a test_drive . 5 . Falling_in_love A good salesperson can see the twinkle in your eye when you ' re enchanted by a particular car , says Peterson . And that twinkle will cost you ; a clever vendor will work_on your emotions . &quot; You ' d look great in this car , &quot; the dealer will say . &quot; A lot of successful people buy this car . It ' s a sign that you ' ve made_it . A symbol of your success . Sure , it costs more , but most valuable things do. &quot; And off you float into Freeway Dreamland , where other drivers enviously eye your personalized plates as you pass . Snap out of it ! You don ' t need a V-6 engine in bumper-to-bumper traffic . And any woman who dates you for your car will dump you just as quickly when she finds_out what the car payments are doing to your bank balance . Bring along a reasonable friend -- one who is good at pulling you back to reality -- on your car-buying excursions , suggests Consumers Union ' s Snyder . Failing that , simply go_for a cup of coffee before you buy , says Peterson . You may see the car differently if you step away for a moment . 6 . Flunking the insurance test Do you know how much more it will cost to insure a Chevrolet Camaro than a similarly priced Ford Taurus ? Depending_on your age and driving record , the answer may astound you , says Morey Stettner , author of &quot; BuyerBeware : An Industry Insider Shows You How to Win the Insurance Game. &quot; The actual cost will depend_on your age , driving record and ZIP_Code . But to get an idea , consider Sarah , a 35-year-old teacher who lives_in Santa Monica . A standard policy with State Farm Insurance will cost her $ 1 # 624 annually on a new Taurus , compared to $ 2 # 668 for the Camaro -- a whopping $ 1 # 044 difference . If you are young and have a checkered -- or limited -- driving history or poor grades in school , the difference could be substantially more . And if you are leasing , your leasing company may require you to carry more insurance , with lower deductibles , than most states ' insurance laws -- or most moderate-income drivers -- would require . The company doesn ' t want to take the chance that you ' ll get_in an accident and not have the money to pay_for repairs . Obviously , the boosted coverage will cost more ; the difference will vary widely with the type of car , your address and driving record . However , it ' s safe to say you could spend $ 200 to $ 1 # 000 more on insurance each year if you lease rather than buy . 7 . Buying_off the lot Car_dealers like it when you buy cars off the lot , for the simple reason that it reduces their inventory , which cuts their costs . And , of course , an immediate sale means an immediate commission , which is enough to warm any salesperson ' s heart . But for the buyer , buying_off the lot can be problematic for the simplest of reasons : It ' s unlikely that the exact car you want is there , in the right color and with just the right options.When you buy_off the lot , you usually get some things you don ' t want , and the car might be missing other options you do want . You can have the missing options added at the dealership , but beware : The warranty may_not cover a dealer-added option . And of course , you ' ve got_to pay_for all_the options -- even if they weren ' t what you had_in_mind . Dealers often say they ' ll give you a great_deal if you buy a car off the lot , and some do . But if the car comes loaded with a lot of unwanted options , that good_deal still may cost hundreds of dollars more_than the car you wanted . If you know what you want and it ' s not there , keep shopping -- or order it . You may have to wait a while , but console yourself with the knowledge that you can buy something nice with the savings . 8 . Loading_up on options Have you stopped to figure_out exactly what you ' d like on your car and how much you can afford to pay_for it ? that ' s a surprisingly important question , considering that the cost of a car can rise as much as 50 % when it ' s loaded rather than stripped . Some options -- automatic_transmission , for example , or three-point seat restraints -- are worth having for reasons of safety , resale value and insurance costs , says Snyder . But upgraded sound_systems , special seats , alloy wheels , tinted glass and special coatings on the paint or seats usually don ' t pay_off . If they mean a lot to you , go_ahead and buy them . But realize that you ' re paying merely for your enjoyment . Peterson suggests making a list of the options you want and things you ' d buy if the price were right -- and then sticking_to the list . 9 . Buying the extended warranty The car you buy ought to come_with a good factory warranty guaranteeing that if anything goes_wrong during the first year or two , the manufacturer will fix it for free , says Snyder . Extended warranties , which cost $ 200 a year or more , are frequently a waste_of_money , Snyder says . They generally force you to get service at a particular location . They often become invalid if you fail to maintain regular maintenance . And if the company that provided the warranty disappears or goes bankrupt , there are few , if any , ways to enforce the contract . 10 . Forgetting the mechanical check If you ' re buying new , you don ' t need a mechanical check because you ' ve got a warranty . But many people who buy used cars make the mistake of trusting the seller ' s assurances that the car is in good_condition , says Peterson . One woman recently bought a $ 5 # 000 pickup that drove like a dream at the dealership . The next morning , when the truck was cold , the gear shift would n ' t budge , Peterson says . The pickup had been &quot; doctored &quot; for_sale -- something a good mechanic would have detected in a flash . The buyer hadn ' t checked . Another serious problem with used cars is odometer tampering . that ' s when somebody turns_back the mileage meter to indicate the car has been driven , say , 40 # 000 miles when the real mileage is approaching 100 # 000 . Those miles are the difference between buying a used car and a relic . Odometer tampering can be hard to detect , but a good mechanic can give you an opinion as_to whether the mileage reading appears to be accurate . You have to ask , however ; it ' s not a standard part of a mechanical check .
