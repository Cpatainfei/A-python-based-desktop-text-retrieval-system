   <HEADLINE> 15 NAMED TO COUNCIL SET TO RULE PALESTINIANS ; MIDEAST : NEW AUTHORITY COULD TAKE_OVER NEXT WEEK FROM ISRAELIS . TEN MEMBERS MUST STILL BE APPOINTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 15-member authority was appointed Thursday to become the Palestinians ' first government of_their_own in Jericho and the Gaza Strip , and Palestinian leaders said the new council could assume power with the last Israeli troop withdrawal on Wednesday . Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat conveyed the names to Israel under an agreement that the remaining 10 members of the 25-person authority , whose appointments have been delayed because of political turmoil within the Palestinian ranks , will be named later . Arafat will head the authority , which includes two women , two former deportees , members of the PLO Executive Committee and some of the most influential Palestinian leaders within the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , including Hanan Ashrawi , Faisal Husseini and Saeb Erekat . &quot; It ain ' t easy , &quot; Nabil Shaath , chief PLO negotiator , said of the delay in naming the Palestinian Authority . &quot; This is the first Cabinet the Palestinian people have ever had to run their affairs in their country. &quot; In the occupied territories , Palestinian police completed their initial deployment in the town of Rafah on the Egyptian border , the largest town so far to come under Palestinian control . The first 23 Palestinian police arrived in Jericho , the West_Bank town that will be the seat of government of the new Palestinian Authority . But 300 more officers were held_up on the Allenby Bridge at the Jordan border in a delay PLO officials expected would be resolved overnight . The arduous process of getting a new Palestinian government in place -- delayed after many Palestinians expressed reluctance to serve because they oppose the peace plan and Arafat ' s single-handed management style -- mirrors the halting deployment of Palestinian police ; both have been beset with severe logistic and economic problems in the days since the peace agreement was signed May 4 . Shaath said arriving Palestinian forces were halted for days by Yemen ' s raging civil_war and had to travel_by bus and truck from Libya ' s southern border near Chad . Further , PLO officials in Egypt were left drastically short of cash for the police deployment , prompting Shaath to send an urgent cable to Arafat over the weekend begging for more money . Shaath told Arafat he had sent $ 60 # 000 , secured through personal_loans and guarantees , to finance the entry of the first police . &quot; I cannot do more . . . . I cannot perform miracles , &quot; Shaath told the PLO leadership . At a news_conference Thursday in Cairo , Shaath said he was trying to finance the initial deployment with only a $ 2-million grant from Norway in_hand -- less than half the first month ' s salary for the 9 # 000-member Palestinian police_force . &quot; We really had very , very tough financial problems last week , &quot; he said , adding that forthcoming grants will ease the crunch . A $ 5-million grant from the United States to fund the police deployment is_due to arrive on Tuesday ; $ 8.6 million from the European Union is_due in two to three weeks ; Germany has recently pledged $ 350 # 000 and France $ 2.4 million worth of communications_equipment . Japan has agreed to provide $ 10 million for building 300 housing units for incoming police . Shaath said the naming of the initial contingent of the Palestinian Authority will allow normal business to be conducted . &quot; With the naming of the first 15 names , which will be in place soon , we will be able to constitute the Palestinian Authority on the ground very soon , &quot; he said . &quot; The normal business of governing will start , and then the tougher questions will have to be answered. &quot; There was no indication of what persuaded some West_Bank leaders , unenthusiastic about the peace agreement and with a history of strong disputes with Arafat over his leadership style , to serve . But Shaath , who is among those named to the authority , said all_of those serving expect it to represent a genuine voice of democracy in the fledgling Palestinian homeland . &quot; In my mind , blinded rulers don ' t see that democracy is the best way a ruler has to go get cooperation and acceptance from his people , &quot; he said . &quot; Democracy is the best way anybody has ever discovered to marshal people ' s efforts without edict. &quot; Ashrawi , the Palestinians ' spokeswoman in peace talks with Israel in Washington , is joined on the authority by another woman , Intisar Wazir , popularly known as Om Jihad , widow of slain PLO official Abu Jihad . Shaath said he expected that several other women would be appointed when the full 25-member list is finalized . The list is weighted with Arafat ' s Fatah faction but includes at least two smaller PLO factions in an attempt to assure broad-based backing for the new government . Earlier Thursday in Cairo , delegates from 40 nations , discussing the plight of Palestinians around the world , announced that donors have pledged more_than $ 50 million since October to help refugees who will not immediately benefit from the autonomy plan . But they said it will be at least two to four weeks before Israel and its neighbors begin deciding on readmission for an estimated 800 # 000 Palestinians displaced from the West_Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle_East War .</TEXT>
