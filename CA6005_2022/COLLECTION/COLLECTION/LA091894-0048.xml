   <HEADLINE> ON THE RECORD : KODALY , THE OTHER HUNGARIAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inevitably , Bela Bartok ' s is the name mentioned first when discussing Hungarian compos ers of the 20th Century . Zoltan Kodaly , his friend , colleague and contemporary -- although he outlived Bartok by 22 years -- is usually &quot; the other guy. &quot; Outside Hungary , at any rate . While there can be little doubt that Bartok was the innovative genius , Kodaly is hardly any less important as a national father figure -- he showed equal contempt for fascism and communism , surviving and prevailing over both regimes -- and as an ethnologist and educator . The so-called Kodaly Method , which promotes universal musical literacy through group singing , has found wide acceptance in many countries . Kodaly ' s assimilable , tuneful and superbly crafted compositions are paradoxically much less familiar than Bartok ' s more abstruse , dissonant ones . Kodaly ( 1882-1967 ) , the younger_man by one year , was a populist , like the Copland of the ballets , a situation that confounds the programming mavens : Do you put him on pops programs or is he too &quot; foreign &quot; for that ? Then again , is he too easy for &quot; serious &quot; programs ? * The result is that we rarely hear Kodaly ' s orchestral music in concert at all , while his much less audience-friendly chamber_music is neglected perhaps because it isn ' t by Bartok . The world seems capable of embracing only one Hungarian composer at a time . And so , the Lord created recordings , with some of the best ones of Kodaly ' s music being of very recent vintage , a list headed by a collection of his major orchestral works_on a small , classy Danish label , Kontrapunkt ( 32153 / 4 , two CDs ) . The set offers polished and quite stunningly idiomatic performances from an expatriate Hungarian conductor named Janos Furst , who directs the Helsinki Philharmonic -- not normally a glamour ensemble but giving a convincing impression of one during these rewarding two hours . Furst and his sensitive engineers see_to_it that the scores make their pungent rhythmic points and that Kodaly ' s colorful orchestration is not only clearly but realistically projected . The most familiar work is the composer ' s own enduringly clever suite from his folk opera &quot; Hary Janos , &quot; and it is given its due here . Even more impressive , however , is the stirring and neglected ( by conductors and by the big labels ) &quot; Peacock &quot; Variations , which hasn ' t sounded this sumptuous since the memorable mid-1960s edition by the London Symphony conducted by the tragically short-lived Istvan Kertesz . Lovely and lovable as well is the present version of the Dances From Galanta ( 1933 ) , its melting clarinet solos played with soaring grace and dollops of authentic Magyar rubato by the Finnish orchestra ' s uncredited principal . The present artists also offer eloquent readings of the sweetly beguiling &quot; Summer Evening , &quot; begun in 1906 but not reaching its final form until 1930 , when the composer dedicated it to Arturo Toscanini , and the rather wan , three-movement Symphony , started in the 1920s and not completed until 1961 , again dedicated to Toscanini , this time in memoriam . K odaly ' s chamber works tend to be tough nuts , although still a long way from Bartok ' s in terms of dissonance and rhythmic complexity . The most ambitious of them is the First String_Quartet , completed in 1909 -- at the height of his folk-music collecting partnership with Bartok -- and rarely heard , even on recordings . One strike against it is its three-quarter-hour length . But granting the excesses of youth and the lingering Romantic notion that bigger is better , it remains a fascinating , often gorgeous beast , shot through_with Eastern exoticism and the Debussy-like shimmer found in the roughly contemporaneous &quot; Bluebeard ' s Castle &quot; by Bartok . The Second Quartet , written nearly a decade later , is briefer , darker emotionally and more consistent in its working of the folk idiom into a coherent structure , if not quite as charmingly effusive as its predecessor . Both are presented with rhythmic punch and lyric expansiveness by the excellent Copenhagen-based Kontra Quartet , comprising a Hungarian first violinist and three Danes ( BIS 564 ) . *</TEXT>
