   <HEADLINE> REEL LIFE / FILM AND VIDEO FILE ; WARNER BROS . STUDIO STORE TO MAKE ITS DEBUT ; THE SHOP , ONE OF 60 LAUNCHED SINCE 1991 , WILL BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS FRIDAY AT THE OAKS SHOPPING CENTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looney Tune locals who want a Sylvester and Tweety letterman ' s jacket or a Road_Runner golf shirt no longer have to cross the county_line . On Friday , Warner Bros . will open a studio store at The Oaks shopping_center in Thousand Oaks , one of 60 such stores launched since the first opened in Beverly Center in 1991 . The store at The Oaks will have some stuffed animals and about a couple dozen Looney Tunes titles on videocassette for the kids , but like the sly and ironic cartoons themselves , much of the store ' s merchandise has been created for adults . Animation graces everything from coffee_mugs to golf_bags to sequined jackets that sell for several hundred dollars . For around $ 10 # 000 , you can even get original animation cels from such greats as Tex Avery , Friz Freleng and Wile E . Coyote creator Chuck Jones . Warner execs say that the overall response has been tremendous and that they expect to open 50 more stores this year as they heat_up the challenge to steal a piece of the entertainment merchandising pie from Disney . The enterprise is not without pitfalls . How long can it be before Warner is named in product liability suits for its ACME line of rocket-powered roller_skates , hang_gliders , etc ? * Construction starts Wednesday on the Edwards Camarillo Movie Palace , a huge 12-plex cinema slated to open on Thanksgiving . The theater is touted as having &quot; state-of-the-art everything &quot; from Dolby Stereo Surround Sound to cup-holder armrests . One innovation leaves us puzzled , though . A press_release promises that the popcorn stand will feature &quot; Real Butter &quot; topping . We ' re not sure how this differs from real butter ( without capitals or quotation_marks ) , and the Edwards spokesman was unavailable to explain whether the distinction is chemical or simply typographical . * The Ventura College Theater wraps_up its Travel Film Series today with a presentation of Hal McClure ' s &quot; Istanbul. &quot; McClure was a reporter for the Associated Press and spent almost five years in Istanbul as the correspondent there . McClure shows Turkey ' s strong links to its biblical past . The film visits Tarsus , hometown of St . Paul , early Christianity ' s leading publicist , and Ephesus , where the_Virgin Mary is believed to be buried . Also on the tour is Myra , hometown of St . Nicholas , who was elected bishop there in the 4th Century before he was tapped as the folk legend Santa Claus . Ventura College is at 4667 Telegraph Road . Show time is 7:30 p.m. Admission is $ 7.50 in_advance , $ 9 at the door . For information , call 654-6459 .</TEXT>
