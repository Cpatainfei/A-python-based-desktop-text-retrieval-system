   <HEADLINE> THE COURAGE OF HIS COMPROMISE ; RABIN DEMONSTRATES COMMITMENT TO PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What was Baruch Goldstein , the murderer of 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque , trying to kill ? Was his target solely those Palestinians ? Perhaps no one ever will know what compelled him to this atrocity . But it is possible to imagine that Goldstein also had_in_mind Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the &quot; Declaration of Principles &quot; that Rabin signed last September with Yasser Arafat , head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization . The Israeli right_wing has vilified Rabin -- a war hero and a man who enjoys a unique level of public_trust in his country -- as a traitor because of that agreement . All that was necessary to sabotage the agreement , many on both sides believed , was for Israel to miss the April 13 target date for the withdrawal of its troops from the Gaza Strip . If that first , visible step could be halted , then the entire political transformation intended to follow it could be sabotaged and Rabin could be brought_down . If that in fact was what was_on Goldstein ' s mind , then there was indeed method in his madness . This is why so many Israeli leaders have refused to characterize him as an isolated crazy . If his massacre did not have the prior approval and sponsorship of Jewish extremists in Israel , it clearly had their posterior endorsement . A pilgrimage to his grave on Thursday by at least 10 # 000 Jewish militants has made that grimly clear . Goldstein ' s gambit -- their gambit -- almost worked . The mosque rampage touched_off horrendous violence in the streets of Gaza , a mini- intifada with foreseeable answering violence by the Israeli army . It looked_for a week or two as if Goldstein ' s act indeed had blasted the April 13 withdrawal date off the Israeli-Palestinian peace calendar . But that was not the case . Peace talks suspended after the Feb . 25 attack have been resumed . A marathon effort by the negotiators is being matched by a logistic prodigy on the part of the Israeli army , which will have left Gaza by April 13 . Israel has made its apology for the mosque murders in the most painful and convincing way possible , by acknowledging and accepting a U.N. resolution of condemnation . Steps are rapidly being taken toward organizing a Palestinian police_force for newly autonomous Gaza . And in the most important symbolic step of all , Israel has consented to the presence of international observers in Hebron , where Goldstein ' s attack took_place . The presence of international observers often suggests that the affairs of more_than one nation are concerned . By strong implication , this move underscores that the Palestinians ' interests are true national interests . Goldstein has lost . Rabin has won . And under Rabin ' s leadership , Israel is staying the course to the only kind of victory that can last : a victory built_on peace .</TEXT>
