   <HEADLINE> BRITISH COLA BOASTS ' ORIGINAL AMERICAN TASTE , ' BUT IS IT REAL THING ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britain ' s biggest supermarket chain this week took_on Coca-Cola Co. , the world ' s most famous trademark , by launching its own brand of soft_drink in what the country ' s media have dubbed a cola war . J . Sainsbury unveiled the look-alike Classic Cola in its 341 stores nationwide alongside familiar Coca-Cola cans from the U.S. soft-drinks giant . Sainsbury ' s brand boasts of &quot; original American taste. &quot; The cola rivalry came as some of the world ' s top-brand owners pressed for an additional clause in a Trade Marks Bill being debated by the_British Parliament to ban retailers from marketing look-alike , own-label products . Food and consumer product giants such_as Swiss-based Nestle and America ' s Procter &amp; Gamble say they invest heavily in advertising to establish their branded goods only to see own-label copycat products packaged in a similar way . Sainsbury ' s cola is now out on the shelves in similar red-and-white packaging to Coca-Cola , threatening to dent Coca-Cola ' s leading 60 % share of Britain ' s 670-million-pound ( $ 1-billion ) cola market . &quot; We believe it matches the leading brands , &quot; Sainsbury spokeswoman Louise Platt said . She disputed suggestions that her company ' s cola was designed to look_like a counterfeit Coke , at a price of about 38 cents per can , contrasted with 48 cents for Coke . &quot; The lettering ' s different , &quot; Platt insisted . But the white word Coke on the red can of Coca-Cola appears quite similar to the word Cola on the Sainsbury version , both in size and style . Both cans have pictures of bottles that look_like old Coke bottles . The red-on-white cans of Diet Coke and Sainsbury ' s Diet Classic Cola also could be mixed_up by someone who fails to look closely . About two-thirds of Sainsbury turnover is now in own-label products , which are cheaper than main-brand alternatives . Importantly for Sainsbury , Britain ' s most profitable supermarket chain , its own brands have no hefty advertising budgets and are more profitable than major brands . Coca-Cola is not taking the challenge lying_down after it saw its share of the North_American cola market come under heavy fire from own-label Canadian manufacturer Cott Corp. , the group also behind the production of Sainsbury ' s Classic Cola .</TEXT>
