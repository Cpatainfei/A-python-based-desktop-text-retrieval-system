   <HEADLINE> RISKS BLOCKED HYPERBARIC CHAMBER USE ; MEDICINE : COMPLICATIONS IN LAKIN ' S FIGHT AGAINST ' FLESH-EATING BACTERIA ' MADE USE OF OXYGEN THERAPY UNWISE , FRIENDS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While funeral plans for the respected chancellor of Ventura County ' s community_colleges were completed Tuesday , family friends and a doctor moved to quell the controversy about the medical treatment Thomas G . Lakin received for a &quot; flesh-eating bacteria &quot; infection . Dropping blood_pressure and potential nerve damage prevented doctors from treating Lakin in a hyperbaric_chamber in the hours before he died , friends close to the educator ' s family told The Times on Tuesday . Lakin , who died Sunday at Los Robles Regional Medical_Center from necrotizing fasciitis , could not undergo treatments in the pressurized oxygen tank because physicians were more worried about stabilizing his blood_pressure , the friends said . Physicians did not identify the bacteria until they operated_on Lakin ' s infected leg Saturday night . After complaining of a sore_throat for days , the chancellor went_to the Thousand Oaks medical_center emergency_room on Friday , but was sent home hours later after initial treatments . Lakin returned to the hospital on Saturday , complaining of continuing soreness in his throat and severe swelling and pain in his right leg . Doctors on Sunday lost an all-night battle to save his life . J . B . Wilmeth , director of the hospital ' s hyperbaric unit , has questioned why Lakin was not treated with the technology , which has been used successfully on five patients with the same ailment this year . On Tuesday , Wilmeth declined comment except to say his previous statements were not a criticism of how the Lakin case was handled , since he had no firsthand knowledge of the circumstances . &quot; You know more about the case than I do at this point_in_time , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m just not making any more comments . There are some obvious reasons from my standpoint . It ' s just not worth getting_into anymore. &quot; Family friends said that employing the hyperbaric_chamber , which uses oxygen to kill the bacteria and prevent it from spreading , was not a medical option available for Lakin . &quot; There was an extremely low blood_pressure , and the medical team was focused_on maintaining the blood_pressure to help him survive , &quot; said one close friend , who asked not to be identified . &quot; The decision not to use the chamber was consistent with his condition at the time. &quot; * Basing their decision on doctors ' advice , the Lakin family opted to fight the fast-moving infection by amputating Lakin ' s right leg and administering large doses of antibiotics , friends said . Lakin was anesthetized , and the surgery was performed late Saturday . During the procedure , nine doctors struggled constantly to keep the chancellor ' s blood_pressure high enough for him to survive . Meanwhile , friends said , Lakin began exhibiting signs of potential nerve damage that could have permanently affected his motor skills even if doctors had been successful in removing the bulk of the infected tissue . After the leg was removed , doctors found that the bacteria already had spread to Lakin ' s chest and left arm . A short time later , he was placed on life-support systems , where he remained for more_than 12 hours before dying Sunday afternoon , friends said . One of the physicians brought_in to treat Lakin as his condition worsened Saturday defended the care given the 50-year-old educator , particularly the decision not to use the hospital ' s hyperbaric_chamber . &quot; It ' s not as easy as that , &quot; he said , speaking on condition that he not be named . &quot; The primary treatment for that is surgery . There are a_million other things that can be done , ( but ) surgery and antibiotics are the primary care. &quot; The family friends and physician commented Tuesday to quiet a controversy begun Monday , when Wilmeth questioned why he was not summoned to help treat Lakin . Wilmeth said he has treated five other Ventura County patients afflicted with the bacteria over the past six months , and that each had survived . Hospital officials have declined to discuss details of Lakin ' s treatment , citing a request for privacy from family members , who will not speak publicly about the case . Jeff Marsee , a vice-chancellor of the Ventura County Community_College District who has served as the Lakin family spokesman since the tragedy , said it is unfortunate that questions about treatment have interfered with their privacy . &quot; The family ' s desire for privacy is focused entirely on protecting the small children , &quot; Marsee said , referring to Lakin ' s two young daughters . &quot; It was not intended to reflect the competency of the physicians or the medical center. &quot; Medical experts outside Ventura County on Tuesday said the decision to use surgery and antibiotics was the appropriate treatment . * Carol Peterson , a physician in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services acute communicable_disease control division , said she has seen little information about using hyperbaric_chambers to fight necrotizing fasciitis , the scientific name for the infection that destroys living tissue . &quot; I can maybe recall one publication where it was suggested , &quot; she said . &quot; Intuitively , it seems like it might help , but this organism is not one of the ones we might call an oxygen-hating bacteria. &quot; For funeral services , Lakin family members and friends will gather_in the chapel at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills at 9 a.m. Saturday . College district officials have scheduled a separate memorial service for the chancellor at 10 a.m. Monday on the lawn between the district office and the H . P . Wright Library on Day Road in Ventura . &quot; It ' s going_to be a chance for the employees of the district and residents of the county to join together and honor Thomas ' memory , &quot; district official Barbara Buttner said . Times staff writer Mary F . Pols and correspondent Matthew Mosk contributed to this story .</TEXT>
