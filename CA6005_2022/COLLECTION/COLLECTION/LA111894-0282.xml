   <HEADLINE> LEADER OF PROP . 187 EFFORT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY ; FUNDS : MOST OF RONALD S . PRINCE ' S DEBT IS FROM THE INITIATIVE . BECAUSE HE ' S SEEKING COURT RELIEF , THE CAMPAIGN can ' t RAISE FUNDS FOR THOSE COSTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ronald S . Prince , the Proposition 187 campaign co-chairman , has filed for personal bankruptcy , with most of his $ 313 # 700 debt made_up of expenses from the successful anti-illegal immigration initiative . Among Prince ' s unpaid creditors , according to the Chapter 7 petition filed_in U.S. Bankruptcy Court , is former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Alan C . Nelson , who is listed as being owed $ 36 # 000 . A campaign finance report filed earlier this year showed Nelson billed the campaign $ 26 # 000 for consulting services , which included co-authoring Proposition 187 . The largest single creditor reported in Prince ' s bankruptcy petition is Yorba Linda campaign consultant Robert Kiley , who is owed $ 170 # 000 . Prince states in his petition that his assets -- including a 1986 Buick , $ 200 cash and other personal items -- total $ 3 # 950 . Supported by his family and living rent free in a Tustin home , Prince said his income during the past three years was in the form of gifts totaling $ 3 # 500 . Not mentioned in the petition is a $ 32 # 000 lawsuit settlement he was awarded in March , 1993 , as a result of a Bankruptcy Court dispute with a Canadian immigrant who was his friend and construction partner . The settlement agreement is contained in the files of the old Bankruptcy Court case . Prince could not be reached for comment Thursday . But his court action appeared to catch some by surprise . Campaign treasurer Betty Presley said she did not know details about Prince ' s bankruptcy or why he assumed much of the campaign ' s debt . &quot; I don ' t know anything and I kind of would just as soon not know , &quot; Presley said . &quot; I don ' t know anything about his personal debts. &quot; Kiley , meanwhile , refused to comment . Campaign finance experts said it is not unusual for a campaign official to take_on a committee ' s financial liability in_order to secure contracts with vendors . &quot; It may very well be that at the time that he contracted for these services , he held himself to be personally liable as well , &quot; said Jeanette Turvill , a spokeswoman for the California Fair Political Practices Commission . However , now that Prince is seeking relief through Bankruptcy Court , the campaign cannot raise funds to repay those debts , she said . The last campaign finance report filed before the Nov . 8 election by the Proposition 187 campaign committee showed that it had raised $ 484 # 188 and spent $ 582 # 352 , with an outstanding debt of $ 297 # 691 . Early on in the Proposition 187 campaign , finance reports listed Prince as the donor of a $ 20 # 000 loan to the campaign . However , caught_up in a legal battle with his former attorney who was seeking payment for a $ 9 # 600 legal bill , Prince told an Orange County Superior_Court judge last month that he had no assets and that the $ 20 # 000 loan was actually made by his father , Downey businessman Leland Prince . The younger Prince ' s petition to settle his debts through asset liquidation was filed Monday , a day before he was_due back in Superior_Court to show proof that the $ 20 # 000 campaign loan was made by his father . The attorney who received a judgment against Prince , William Baker of Santa Ana , had argued in Superior_Court last month that if Prince could lend money to the Proposition 187 campaign , then he had the means to pay his legal bill , which has since gone_up from $ 9 # 600 to $ 18 # 000 . In the bankruptcy petition , Prince stated he owes his father $ 20 # 000 for a &quot; personal_loan &quot; made this year , plus another $ 14 # 000 that the elder Prince lent to his son in 1992 . In addition to Nelson , Kiley and Leland Prince , other creditors included in the bankruptcy petition were : * American Petition Consultants of Rancho Cordova , the firm that gathered signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot . The amount due is $ 28 # 500 . * Freeway Commerce Center of Tustin , which is owed $ 600 in rent for the campaign headquarters . * James Maryea of Westminster , who is owed $ 25 # 000 . Maryea handled the direct mail and campaign literature for Proposition 187 . * John Lunetta of Corona , who now holds the $ 18 # 000 legal bill that Prince owed Baker , his former attorney . * United Parcel Service , which is owed $ 1 # 600 . The bankruptcy record states that Prince , an unemployed accountant , is supported by his family . His petition stated that the house he lives_in is owned by a Tustin couple , but he holds a $ 48 # 633 note on the house secured by a deed_of_trust . The owner &quot; has exchanged free rent in property for note . . . ( Prince ) has received no cash , &quot; according to the petition . Prince also stated in the court record that he paid $ 300 to a paralegal firm in Huntington Beach for assistance in preparing the bankruptcy petition .
