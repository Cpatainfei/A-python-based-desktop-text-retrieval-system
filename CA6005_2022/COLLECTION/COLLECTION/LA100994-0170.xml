   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; BEHIND MEXICO ' S VIOLENCE : THE RISE OF MIDDLE-MAN DRUG CARTELS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once again , the assassination of a politician is raising troubling questions about the power and influence of Mexico ' s drug cartels in the country ' s politics . In August , a for mer deputy to the Mexican attorney_general warned that drug_traffickers have forged links with prominent members of the government and police and may have been behind the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . Now , the slaying of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the deputy leader of the ruling party , seems to add credence to the earlier warning : His brother is deputy attorney_general for drug investigations and he was apparently killed by a gunman hired by an in-law of a top lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel . Both assassinations struck_down close associates of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , whose approach to political reform seems to have put his allies at risk . The power of Mexico ' s traditional political_leaders -- from labor boss to regional and local cacique of the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- is eroding . Meanwhile , shake-ups in the attorney_general ' s office have put the heat on drug_traffickers , who once could count_on a free hand by bribing government officials . With common enemies , and often common interests , corrupt politicians in the PRI ' s old_guard and police commanders are making common cause with the drug cartels to block Mexico ' s transition to democracy . Underlying the growing political violence is a revolution in the structure of drug trafficking . Before Salinas , the Mexican drug business was largely a domestic affair . Marijuana and opium_poppies , grown in the Mexican Sierras , was the primary exports . During the administration of President Miguel del la Madrid ( 1982-1988 ) , the Mexican army routinely staged spectacular incinerations of impounded marijuana . Yet , no serious attempts were made to seize the drug lords . As illustrated in the case of Enrique Camarena , the Drug Enforcement Agent murdered by Rafael Caro Quintero ' s Guadalajara Cartel , collusion between influential members of the government and drug_traffickers was widespread . At the beginning of Salinas ' administration , a number of changes radically altered the drug picture . For one , Salinas moved against the drug kingpins . Quintero was apprehended and imprisoned , along with several lesser-known traffickers . Second , a transformation in the drug business itself was under way . Colombian traffickers , who had relied primarily on Caribbean routes to deliver cocaine to the United States , began shifting their operations westward . With their links in Cuba and the Bahamas under increasing scrutiny , they began focusing_on the U.S.-Mexican border . The outcome was the rise to prominence of new cartels , consisting chiefly of middle men engaged in transshipment . At one end of the U.S.-Mexico border , the cocaine trade fed the rise of the Tijuana Cartel , led by the Arellano Felix brothers . At the other end , in Tamaulipas , it fueled the Gulf Cartel , under Juan Garcia Abrego . The Colombian connection has , in turn , introduced new elements into the relationship between the government and drug_traffickers in Mexico . The switch to cocaine has multiplied the amount_of_money involved by several orders_of_magnitude , leaving greater sums with which to secure the cooperation of corruptible officials . By raising the stakes , it has also led to the introduction of heretofore unimaginable violence . In the past , hits were confined to rivals and nosy journalists . Now , as in Colombia , the circle of violence has been extended_to government officials who are perceived to be threats to what is now Mexico ' s most profitable -- albeit illegal -- business . The Arellano Felix brothers are wanted in the murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo of Guadalajara . Humberto Garcia Abrego , brother of the Gulf Cartel kingpin , has been arrested in connection with the assassination of Ruiz Massieu . Significantly , neither the Arellano brothers nor Juan Garcia Abrego have been caught . Earlier this year , an attempt to nab a lieutenant of the Tijuana Cartel ended in disaster when a team of federal judicial police was ambushed by state judicial police . The team leader was killed , the mobster escaped . The incident underscored the extent to which traffickers have infiltrated the police . The fact that no serious attempt has been made to seize the Arellanos themselves suggests they may have friends in high places . Salinas ' reluctance to pursue wider political reforms limited his ability to confront the threat of drug_traffickers allied_with corrupt PRI politicians . Most notably , he abided_by an unwritten rule of Mexico ' s political elite : under no circumstances may present and former members of the Cabinet be investigated for corruption . Such impunity has two dangerous consequences . One , it makes_it easier for drug_traffickers to buy protection from officials who have much to gain and little to lose by collaborating . Second , it enhances the power of well-placed enemies of reform , providing them greater latitude to sabotage change . All of which confronts the new president , Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , with a vexing problem : How to outmaneuver the increasingly dangerous adversaries of reform without jeopardizing the stability of the country . The PRI ' s old_guard and the drug cartels are , in_effect , offering him both a carrot and a stick_to slow_down reform . The carrot is the vital support provided Zedillo in a difficult campaign . The stick is the implicit message delivered by recent assassinations . In the past year and a half , three men at the pinnacle of church and state have been killed : a cardinal , a virtual heir to the presidency and a congressional leader . If these could be hit , anyone could . Zedillo thus cannot afford to hold_on to his predecessor ' s compromise . If he is to root_out the web of corruption that enables mobsters and crooked party_bosses to play politics , he will have to end the policy of impunity for Cabinet members . Measures that only affect subordinates just increase the danger to reformers . By investigating and , where necessary , indicting corrupt ministers , Zedillo can simultaneously remove key adversaries , reduce the influence of the drug cartels and deliver a powerful warning to all government officials about the costs of breaking the law . True , this risks splitting the party that carried him to the presidency , but he now has a broader mandate : that of political reform conferred by Mexicans of all political persuasions. *</TEXT>
