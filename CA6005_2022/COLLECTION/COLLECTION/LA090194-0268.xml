   <HEADLINE> VATICAN STEPS UP ATTACKS AGAINST CAIRO CONFERENCE ; POPULATION : DELEGATION WILL FIGHT DRAFT RESOLUTION THAT ENDORSES ABORTION RIGHTS , LOWER GROWTH_RATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fighting from a script written by Pope John Paul II , the Vatican on Wednesday fired a new broadside against a planned U.N. population conference , attacking the United States in_general and Vice_President Al Gore in particular . A 17-member Vatican delegation leaves today for Cairo , carrying papal instructions to oppose unflaggingly a draft resolution for the Sept . 5-13 conference that endorses abortion on demand and takes a liberal view of human sexuality . Supported by the United States , other governments and feminist groups around the world , such proposals are , nevertheless , seen by John Paul as a blatant assault on the sanctity of life , which he says begins at the instant of conception . On Wednesday , papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro , a member of the high-level delegation , took_issue with Gore , who will head the American delegation and has said that the United States does not seek to proclaim a universal right to abortion . &quot; The draft of the document , which has the U.S. Administration as its principal sponsor , in reality contradicts Mr. Gore , &quot; Navarro told reporters at a Vatican briefing . The Clinton_Administration would allow American funds to flow to international groups that support abortion , reversing the policy of Republican predecessors . Decrying what he called the document ' s attempts to pass_off &quot; social engineering under the guise of human_rights , &quot; Navarro said Vatican delegates to the once-a-decade conference would seek to modify ambiguous language , clarifying draft phrases such_as &quot; reproductive rights &quot; and &quot; sexual health. &quot; In one of its fiercest , most outspoken international diplomatic initiatives in recent years , the Vatican has repeatedly attacked the 118-page draft , which explores ways for slowing rapid population growth that it portrays as a brake on economic development . The Pope himself has spoken repeatedly against draft proposals , which he says would encourage promiscuity and homosexuality , erode moral values and undermine the family . John Paul , above all , wants the conference to ban abortion as a means of population_control . It would also be disastrous , he believes , to assert that abortion is a woman ' s fundamental right . &quot; Should ( the conference ) give further legitimacy to the legal practice of abortion , humanity would suffer another great failure of rights and justice , &quot; the Pope said in a recent attack on the U.N. proposals . The Vatican sees efforts by planners , economists and aid donors to limit population in developing countries as &quot; biological colonialism. &quot; It decries it as an effort to impose First World moral values -- or the lack of them -- on poorer and often more traditional Third_World societies . In attacking the conference , the Vatican has found common cause with some Islamic countries also opposing the thrust and content of the U.N. draft . On Wednesday , top Islamic scholars in Saudi_Arabia called_on all Muslims to boycott the Cairo conference . The Supreme Council of Ulemas , or religious scholars , said in Riyadh that the &quot; immoral and heretical &quot; draft document encourages abortion , contraception , premarital sex and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases . After four days of deliberations , the scholars concluded that policies proposed by the document would transform Islamic society into &quot; one of disease-ridden sex perverts without morals. &quot;</TEXT>
