   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ASSAILS OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS ; FAMILIES : IN ADDRESS TO BLACK BAPTIST GROUP , HE CALLS THE INCREASE IN ILLEGITIMACY A ' DISASTER. ' HE STRESSES THAT GOVERNMENT CANNOT ENFORCE MORALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , in a lengthy address to a Baptist group on the themes of_values and personal responsibility , called the growing rate of out-of-wedlock births in the United States a &quot; disaster. &quot; &quot; It is wrong , &quot; the President said in his first major speech since returning from a 12-day beach vacation . &quot; You shouldn ' t have a baby before you ' re ready , and you shouldn ' t have a baby when you ' re not married . You just have to stop it. &quot; Clinton has spoken before of the societal costs of illegitimacy , but Friday ' s remarks were his most direct and forceful . He said that aid programs can be changed to stop rewarding welfare recipients who bear children out of wedlock and that government programs can be revised to reduce welfare dependency . But he stressed that government cannot enforce morality or teach responsibility . &quot; I ' ll try to do my part , but this is not a government deal , &quot; he told an estimated 12 # 000 members of the National Baptist Convention USA , the nation ' s largest black denomination . &quot; This is the way people are behaving , as if there were no respect for themselves and no future . We have to stop. &quot; Clinton ' s remarks were warmly received . &quot; You are among some of your best_friends , &quot; convention President T . J . Jemison told him . The President was careful not to portray births outside marriage as an African American problem but a nationwide crisis . The rate of white out-of-wedlock births has nearly matched the black percentage and nearly half of all children born in the United States are now born to never-married women , he said . &quot; I don ' t think we ought to give_up on families , &quot; Clinton declared as members of the audience shouted words of encouragement . &quot; Somebody ' s got_to love these children. &quot; Clinton ' s appeal followed several weeks of personal reflection about the direction of his presidency , and marked an effort to rise above the slough of partisan politics and proclaim a moral vision for the nation . While he touched_on the recently passed crime bill and mentioned in passing his efforts to reform the nation ' s health_care system , Clinton deliberately avoided much specific discussion of his legislative agenda . The President has concluded in recent weeks that he has devoted too_much of his time to policies and programs and too_little to articulating a message of renewal for the country . He returned from vacation a year ago with a similar resolve to surmount the mundane . His first major appearance after returning to Washington then was at an interfaith breakfast . He used the occasion to preach on the themes of faith and family . Friday ' s New Orleans address was one of what will be several attempts again this fall to detail what Clinton and his presidency stand_for , aides said . And in the 42-minute speech , Clinton touched all_the bases -- the sanctity of work , the centrality of family , individual responsibility and community involvement . Friday ' s speech came a day after former Vice_President Dan Quayle spoke on the country ' s &quot; poverty of_values , &quot; hitting particularly hard on the obligation of men to assume responsibility for the children they father . &quot; If children grow_up never knowing their father , they ' re bound to assume that fathers are irrelevant and that males are not accountable , &quot; Quayle said Thursday in San Francisco , returning to the scene and subject of his notorious &quot; Murphy Brown &quot; speech in 1992 . &quot; Raising a child is not just a mother ' s responsibility , it is a father ' s responsibility too , &quot; Quayle said . A White_House official said that the timing of Clinton ' s speech and its similarity to Quayle ' s message were &quot; a coincidence. &quot; In Friday ' s appearance , Clinton mused aloud about why Americans are not happier -- and he more popular -- given that the nation is at_peace , the economy is generally healthy and unemployment is falling . Clinton said that the nation is jittery because it is going_through a period of profound change . He compared the insecurity of the post-Cold War era to the years immediately after the two world_wars . He described the current era as a time of hope and fear intermingled . The President also decried what he sees as rampant cynicism about public institutions and public_servants , fueled by a hostile media and a culture of pessimism . &quot; We live_in a time which almost seems to glorify the negative , the cynical , don ' t we ? &quot; Clinton said . He said that many people preach about a decline in values , but warned : &quot; We should not let the voices of despair make our insecurities deeper . That is wrong. &quot; And he also said that discouragement about the current state of the nation should give Americans energy , not paralyze them . &quot; So to all those who preach that we need to return to the values of our faith , I say we do . But the real issue is , what are we going_to do about it . Not what are we going_to say about it but what are we going_to do about it ? &quot; Clinton said . &quot; The saying is important , for we in words come_to visualize the future , and we need the vision so that we do not perish , &quot; he said . &quot; But we must act_on the vision and that ' s where all_the problems come. &quot; After listening to the President ' s remarks from a front-row seat on the stage , the Rev . Jesse Jackson , a leading civil_rights figure , scolded him for ignoring that &quot; economic desperation among blacks is substantial. &quot; &quot; One would expect him to come here and speak_of economic stimulus and jobs and economic development , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; Instead we are getting moral lessons on how to live . And they are good moral lessons . But we must fight welfare and crime with jobs and economic development. &quot; While in New Orleans , Clinton also attended a fund-raising luncheon with about 60 guests and met with the executive board of the National Conference of Black Mayors .</TEXT>
