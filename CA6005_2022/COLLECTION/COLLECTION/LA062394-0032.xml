   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPHS OF A BEAUTIFUL WORLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like the more interesting Conceptual artists of the 1970s , Post-Conceptualist Christopher Williams refuses to acknowledge a mind-body split . His art addresses the senses , as well as the part of the brain that questions cultural codes , layered references , catalogues of inconsistencies and ideologies -- recalcitrant and otherwise . At Margo Leavin Gallery , a new body_of_work titled &quot; For Example : Die Welt ist Scho n ( Revision No . 3 ) &quot; looks_like a suite of photographs by a flighty perfectionist . There are heavily saturated color portraits of Japanese women ; crisp architectural studies of the headquarters of L.A. ' s Department of Water and Power and straight images of museum collectibles that are transformed into exquisite , surreal icons before our eyes . Though the title of the exhibition asserts that &quot; the world is beautiful , &quot; Williams ' work is not strictly about beauty . It is rather about how beauty is constructed by the aestheticizing glance of the camera . Williams borrows his title from a 1928 book of photographs by Albert Renger-Patzsch and August Sander , in which those German Modernists attempted to document all_the beautiful things of this world ( plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , etc. ) . In restaging this Utopian , if Sisyphean , project , he frames the politics of Modernism . Williams demonstrates how the styles and genres of Modernist photography create various classes of objects and subjects . Ethnographic photography turns artifacts into curiosities ; architectural photography transforms living spaces into ruins ; nature photography evacuates the natural . The result is a world not merely beautiful , but regulated : processed , labeled , colonized and contained . The political critique implicit here has been explicit in Williams ' earlier work , most notably in &quot; From Angola to Vietnam &quot; and &quot; Supplement. &quot; Postmodern obliqueness is deployed to challenge Modernist claims of objectivity . However , in the end we are left precisely where we started , with a disparate group of beautiful photographs . This isn ' t a bad place to be , but neither is it the place where Williams ' art is most important . * Margo Leavin Gallery , 812 N . Robertson Blvd. , ( 310 ) 273-0603 , through July 9 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Shackelford ' s Synthesis : In his first one-person exhibition at Ace Contemporary Exhibitions , Stephen Shackelford reveals not only a good working knowledge of recent art history but an impressive synthetic imagination . Stirred into one , big , aesthetic melting_pot is a less bombastic take_on Dennis Oppenheim ' s mechanized operatics , a more playful reading of David Ireland ' s Duchampian ethics , a diluted version of Robert Morris ' hard-line threats and a satirical barb at Matthew Barney ' s absurdist athletics . The latter shows_up in &quot; Fly Chair , &quot; a bright orange chair suspended from the ceiling ' s rafters by a network of bungee_cords , with a large propeller bringing_up the rear and a motor crafted from a weed whacker in the front . During performances , Shackelford pilots this low-tech , anti-futuristic , but apparently efficient vehicle . During the exhibition , it remains empty , less an index of the artist ' s physical derring-do than a mark of his smart-alecky nature . If this piece is still , nothing else in the room is . Everywhere are buzzes , whizzes and blasts . In one corner an amplifier magnifies the sound of an electric_guitar repeatedly striking the wall , in a surprisingly rhythmic kind of head-banging . Elsewhere , a punching_bag spins in circles , its tinker-toy propeller moving so quickly it ' s as dangerous as a buzzsaw . Box_springs and a clean , white pillow look more inviting , but as soon as your head touches the pillow , heavy-metal music blares . Like second-prize winners at a science fair or elegant solutions to non-problems , Shackelford ' s devices are provocative but somewhat beside the point . Not so a large installation in which a silent , pitch-black room is suddenly transformed into a firefly-filled night sky . The viewer ' s body triggers a motion sensor that causes a legion of mechanized , buzzing objects to swarm overhead . In turn , Shackelford triggers in us a dramatic shift in perception , as well as the vertigo we crave from science , technology and ( come_to think_of it ) art . * Ace Contemporary Exhibitions , 5514 Wilshire Blvd. , ( 213 ) 935- 4411 , through July 28 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Stouthearted Men : What is it to be a man ? This is the question Daniel Kaufman asked 75 men , aged 11 to 92 , including Guardian_Angels , retired lumberjacks , attorneys , dry_cleaners , gang members and Zen priests . Their handwritten statements , along with photographic self-portraits each shot with the aid of Kaufman and a 30-foot cable-release cord , are now on view at Newspace . It is interesting that Kaufman insists each subject control his own portrait , choosing the context , props , lighting , etc . Control is , of course , among the most stereotypical of masculine attributes . &quot; Being a man , to me , means being in control of my life . . . sometimes of other people ' s lives , &quot; notes one individual clad in black leather and studs . More interesting , however , is that , despite everything , so few of these men actually seem to be in control . One , who identifies himself as &quot; proud and gay , &quot; photographs himself in his closet . Another , a fireman pictured in uniform clutching a squirting hose , notes that masculinity is &quot; showered &quot; on men , seemingly unaware of the irony . An up-and-coming corporate type with a fat cigar between his teeth writes that &quot; a man is firm ; a woman is soft. &quot; Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar -- but not here . Though the so-called men ' s movement represents a valid interest in redefining ( or at least interrogating ) masculinity , Kaufman ' s survey doesn ' t go very far in that direction . On the whole , his is a pedestrian effort whose sum never adds_up to more_than its individual parts . This may be because Kaufman himself seems to be the only man involved who is interested in ceding control . For the artist , however , this is a dangerous position to take . Allowing 75 different people to have a voice may be exemplary , especially in light of the myth of the solitary , masculine artist-genius . Here it results in little more_than a lot of noise . * Newspace Gallery , 5241 Melrose Ave. , ( 213 ) 469-9353 , through July 2 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Splashy Sarcasm : Does spirituality exist in a world where pilgrims trek to Las Vegas as if it were Mecca ? What might a consumerist mandala look_like ? When ignorance masquerades as populism , who benefits ? In new work_at Rosamund Felsen Gallery , Karen Carson asks serious questions , though her tongue is planted so firmly in her cheek that they occasionally come_out garbled . With signage that looks as though it were picked_up ready-made at the hardware_store , lettering as easy to read as names on the shirts of gas_station attendants and graphic images that might have been snatched off pinball and slot_machines , Carson ' s large , vinyl banners play_at a familiar , down-market vernacular . Less plebeian are the messages her splashy standards spell_out , which concern birth and death , the body and the soul , the self and the other . Translated into either / or propositions , these mimic the structure of Western metaphysics , the format of a late capitalist opinion poll , the appeal of fundamentalist religion and the all-or-nothing mentality of a gambler . Such juxtapositions are intriguing , though their power is muted by a marked sarcasm . This strategy usually works for Carson , but here her tendency to play it for laughs interferes with larger plans , suggesting that this project is not quite finished . * Rosamund Felsen Gallery , 8525 Santa Monica Blvd. , ( 310 ) 652- 9172 , through July 2 .
