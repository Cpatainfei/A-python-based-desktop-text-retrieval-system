   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / JONATHAN CLARKE : ONCE AGAIN , THE HELPING HAND IS ALL THUMBS ; THE U.S. MUST BACK OFF ITS PLEDGE TO SUPPORT UKRAINE ' S ' TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the nation girding itself for a possible invasion of Haiti , it may seem somewhat distracting to direct attention across the Atlantic to the small territory of Crimea on the Black_Sea . In fact , the inauguration of Leonid Kuchma as president of Ukraine last week brings the Administration an opportunity to extricate itself from a disaster of its own making . As the Bosnian tragedy unfolded in 1991 , many mistakes were made . One of the most serious was Western insistence on the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia at a time when the country was irretrievably falling_apart . Underlying this approach was concern that disintegration in the Balkans would unleash an uncontrollable implosion in the Soviet_Union . But its effect was to encourage the federal Yugoslav army , essentially the Serbs , to roll back the secession of Bosnia . Is it too_much to expect that their unhappy experience in Yugoslavia would caution American policy-makers from maladroit interventions in other , equally poisonous ethnic brews ? Apparently it is . This Administration ' s incurable habit of wading into complex situations on the basis of facile analysis is setting the stage for a second Bosnia in Crimea . Crimea contains 2.5 million people , 70 % of whom are ethnic Russians . For 200 years after its liberation from Ottoman domination , it was part of Russia . In 1954 , in a gesture of friendship to mark the 300th anniversary of Ukrainian union with Russia , Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine . This year , the Crimean people , after having initially voted for separation from Russia , have in a series of plebiscites changed their minds -- mainly because of the disastrous performance of the Ukrainian economy -- and now wish to reaffiliate with Russia . In Kiev , the Ukrainian parliament fiercely opposes these aspirations . After their Balkan misadventures , American policy-makers would have been_well advised to stay in the background , offering their good offices as mediators if required , but studiously avoiding taking sides . This would have recognized that the core U.S. interest in Crimea is not whether it forms part of Ukraine or Russia , but that it does not cause war between them -- a war that Russia would win unless the West massively supported Ukraine . Alas , the temptation to meddle was not resisted . In May , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher sent a letter to Leonid Kravchuk , then president of Ukraine , stating that &quot; the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its present borders is something that the U.S. has consistently affirmed. &quot; How ominously Christopher ' s statement recalls the June , 1991 , words of his predecessor , James A . Baker III : &quot; We support the territorial integrity and preservation of the unity of Yugoslavia. &quot; A stable and independent Ukraine certainly constitutes a strong American interest . Unfortunately , like so many other areas of the Clinton foreign_policy , this interest has fallen victim to policy by sound_bite -- in this case , a pronouncement from former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski that Russia can be &quot; either an empire or a democracy ; it cannot be both. &quot; Like other mellifluous catch phrases about Russia ( &quot; shock versus therapy &quot; comes_to_mind from the economic debate ) , this remark sounds good , but it reduces the complex issue of Russia ' s future orientation to false alternatives . Kuchma ' s election changes the political equilibrium in Ukraine . Unlike his predecessor , he will emphasize economic regeneration , which in turn depends_on close economic ties with Russia . This may lead him into conflict with Ukrainian nationalist elements who put strict sovereignty above economic welfare . This is where American policy needs to stand_back and resist the urge of rhetorical meddling . At present , believing that the United States is_on their side , Ukrainian nationalists may seek to court popularity by putting pressure on Crimea , for example by withholding foodstuffs ; this in turn would inflame pro-Russian passions in Crimea , leading perhaps to an appeal for Russian intervention , as is happening in Georgia . If this materialized , the United States would face a fearful dilemma between supporting Ukraine and confronting Russia . At some stage , this confrontation may be necessary , but Crimea is not the right issue . If Christopher is wise , he will see America ' s contribution being to cool passions . Rather than taking sides , he should signal to the Ukrainians , Russians and Crimeans that he will be content with any solution -- including territorial transfer -- that they devise , so_long as it is peaceful .</TEXT>
