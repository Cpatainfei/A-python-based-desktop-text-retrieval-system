   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; WILSON ASSAILS BROWN ' S TIES TO FATHER ON DEATH_PENALTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson chided Democrat Kathleen Brown on Thursday for basing her opposition to the death_penalty in part on her father ' s experience applying capital_punishment when he was the state ' s chief_executive nearly 30 years ago . Wilson , escalating what has become an increasingly personal debate between the two candidates on the sensitive issue , questioned his opponent ' s explanation and three times quoted her father , former Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown , who wrote a book about his personal turmoil over the state ' s ultimate criminal sentence . &quot; She says that her opposition to the death_penalty is a result of what she learned from her father , &quot; Wilson told reporters at a Capitol news_conference . &quot; But I think her explanation to date indicates that if she may be a dutiful daughter , she would not be a good governor. &quot; Wilson added : &quot; With all respect_to Pat Brown , however people may remember him fondly for other reasons , I don ' t think he was greatly admired as governor because of his performance on the death penalty. &quot; Kathleen Brown , at the White_House for a meeting with President Clinton , was informed of Wilson ' s remarks and lashed back at the governor . &quot; That is typical Pete Wilson , &quot; she said . &quot; If Pete Wilson wants to ridicule me and my father and my family values , I would say Pete Wilson has a problem with his values. &quot; Brown , who is seeking to follow her father and her brother , former Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown , into the state ' s highest office , returned to the old Governor ' s Mansion on Tuesday to explain how she came_to oppose the death_penalty . There , in the same room in which her father had pondered the fate of 59 condemned criminals -- and had decided to send 36 to the gas_chamber -- the younger Brown said her position was not based on logic or philosophy , nor on arguments over the death_penalty ' s effectiveness as a deterrent . She described her reasoning as a &quot; gut thing , &quot; based on her family and religious values . Brown added that even though she personally opposes the death_penalty she would carry it out if called_upon to do so , appoint judges who supported it , and not stand_in the way if lawmakers wanted to put a measure on the ballot to expand it . &quot; I oppose it because my father taught me it was wrong and the religious experiences I had reinforced that , &quot; she said . Wilson said he did not think Brown ' s statement was &quot; much of an explanation &quot; and in clear terms spelled_out his own position . &quot; In my case , &quot; Wilson said , &quot; I believe the death_penalty is a deterrent , I think it is an entirely legitimate form of punishment , I think it answers the requirements of justice. &quot; Wilson quoted extensively from Pat Brown ' s book , &quot; Public Justice , Private Mercy , a Governor ' s Education on Death Row. &quot; In weighing one case , Brown wrote : &quot; I was trying to move beyond legal limits as I looked_for reasons to commute &quot; an inmate ' s death sentence . In another case , the elder Brown commuted the sentence of a killer who had not yet formally requested clemency . &quot; I couldn ' t see , &quot; Brown wrote , &quot; how sending him to the gas_chamber would deter some future frightened would-be robber from panicking and striking out at his victim. &quot; Wilson ' s point : If Kathleen Brown says she is following the example of her father , then her father ' s reasoning and actions are fair_game for criticism . And the record , Wilson said , shows that Pat Brown , as time wore_on , leaned more toward granting clemency than denying it . &quot; We know clearly what Pat Brown brought_to these deliberations , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; He was , I think , a good man but he agonized and was ambivalent and through life his attitude changed . More and more he was able to find excuses for granting clemency . I would not have found those excuses. &quot; Wilson also criticized an Assembly committee for bottling_up two bills to expand the death_penalty to cover killings committed in connection with carjackings or drive-by_shootings . Wilson aides have suggested that Democrats blocked the measures so that Brown would not have to defend her opposition to them during the fall campaign . * Times staff writer Glenn Bunting in Washington contributed to this story .</TEXT>
