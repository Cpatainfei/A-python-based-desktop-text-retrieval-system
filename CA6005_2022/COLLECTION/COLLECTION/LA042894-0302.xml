   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S POLITICAL WOES DRIVE THE DOLLAR DOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and the German mark Wednesday , as German short-term interest_rates were cut and political gridlock continued in Japan . Scott Gallopo , chief dealer at Chemical Bank , said the dollar ' s slump against the yen may have to continue before intervention occurs . The U.S. currency has been trading at the low end of a narrow range against the yen for a month . &quot; If the dollar gets_down near the 100-yen level , then I think we ' ll see the G-7 nations coming_in to break the dollar ' s fall , &quot; he said , referring to the Group of Seven , the world ' s largest industrial nations . The dollar was again stymied by Japan ' s uncertain political situation . New Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata is facing the prospect of ruling without a majority in Parliament . The United States has been pressing Japan to open its markets to help narrow the trade_gap between the two nations , but talks between the two countries are stalled and unlikely to resume until the Japanese government is more secure . If trade talks fail completely , many traders think the Clinton_Administration will support a higher yen . In New York , the dollar fell to 102.30 yen , down from Tuesday ' s 102.83. The dollar also slipped against the German mark after the Bundesbank lowered its repurchase rate 0.11 percentage_points to 5.47 % . The rate is charged to banks that borrow from the central_bank . The dollar closed at 1.672 German marks in New York , down from 1.676 on Tuesday . Earlier in Europe , the dollar fell to 1.671 marks from 1.680. A drop_in foreign rates usually strengthens the greenback because it makes U.S. investments , which are bought with dollars , more attractive . Meanwhile , foreign stock_markets closed generally higher . Mexico ' s Bolsa index rallied after Mexican short-term interest_rates declined for the first time in a month . The IPC index closed_up 48.65 points , or 2.13 % , at 2 # 332.78. German share prices closed_off the day ' s highs but higher than the previous day , as DAX futures prices bounced off lows and demand for Daimler and chemical stocks propped_up the market . The DAX-30 index ended at 2 # 253.57 , up 10.37 points . Tokyo stocks also ended firmer on index-linked buying by investment_trusts just before the close , although the rise was exaggerated by very thin volume . The Nikkei 225-share average closed_up 100.22 points at 19 # 729.15. London shares firmed , with the Financial Times 100-share average closing_up 24.7 points at 3 # 150.0 .</TEXT>
