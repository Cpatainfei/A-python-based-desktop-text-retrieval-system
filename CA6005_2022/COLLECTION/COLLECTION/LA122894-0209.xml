   <HEADLINE> POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; TINKERING ON THE INTERNET ? HERE ' S HOW TO STOCK YOUR TOOLBOX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It doesn ' t take much beyond a computer and a modem ( and perhaps a capacity for wasting_time ) to have fun in cyberspace . But just as homeowners over the years acquire a number of tools they couldn ' t live without , on-line veterans typically have several items that make exploring cyberspace more rewarding , less painful or both . we ' ll assume here that you want to roam beyond , say , America Online to try smaller bulletin_board_systems ( BBSes ) and the Internet . Perhaps you even want to dial into the computer at_work , or the computer_system at the offices of your clients . Here ' s a rundown on some of the basics you ' ll find useful . Exploring cyberspace shouldn ' t bankrupt you , so almost everything recommended here is free or cheap . Perhaps the first thing you need is a decent telecommunications program . Windows users -- that ' s probably most of us these days -- already have Windows Terminal , and it actually works . But it lacks many features you ' ll want sooner or later , particularly the ability to capture everything coming_across your screen , so get something better . Several shareware packages offer terrific value in this department . WinRamp Lite , for example , has an impressive array of features that includes floating toolbars that can be customized , Zmodem for fast and easy file transfers , multiple simultaneous terminal windows , RIPScrip support for BBSes that use this graphics system , and more . If you keep the program , registration is just $ 35 . For more information , e-mail info.vironix.com. Speaking of file transfers , you ' ve probably noticed that many of the files you want to download have the &quot; .zip &quot; extension . that ' s because they ' ve been compressed to save on storage and transfer times , using a program named Pkzip . In order to use these files , you first have to &quot; unzip &quot; them . The Pkzip package for zipping and unzipping is available all_over cyberspace as pk204g.exe. It ' s a self-extracting zip file , meaning you just run it and it unzips itself . You can also find shareware Windows shells for Pkzip , which is a DOS program . Now let ' s say you ' ve created a nifty Word for Windows template for writing screenplays , and you want to send it to someone in New York . Trouble is , you ' re on America Online and your friend gets e-mail via MCI Mail , so you can ' t just attach the file to a message . What the two of you need is uuencode and uudecode , a free pair of DOS utilities that make_it possible for binary_files to be posted all_over the Internet . Both are widely available on the major on-line services and the Internet . Let ' s consider your WinWord template . To send it to your friend , you simply uuencode it . This creates a sort of text image of the file while leaving the original intact . Then you paste this &quot; text &quot; into your e-mail message and send it off . When it arrives , your friend can uudecode it , which translates the &quot; text &quot; back into a binary_file . It ' s really easy . Binary_files are uuencoded all_over the ' Net , which is how it is possible for Internet newsgroups , which can carry only text , to contain so many pornographic images . Photos , after all , are binary_files . Good Internet newsreading programs -- such_as tin -- will ask if you ' d like to uudecode any files you are saving . If you plan to do a lot of uuencoding , there ' s even a shareware telecommunications program called WinTel that has uuencode / uudecode built_in , along with &quot; .gif &quot; and JPEG viewers . Indeed , viewers should be a part of every wanderer ' s tool_kit . You need something for looking_at . gif , JPEG and other formats . Good shareware products for this purpose abound , but for Windows you might want to consider a shareware product called Drag &amp; View , which will view almost anything -- including , say , a WordPerfect file , even if you don ' t have WordPerfect . A similar commercial product is Eclipse Find , whose main role is indexing your hard_drive for fast searches . As a Windows user , I ' d find cyberspace a pain without a good clipboard collector . ( For non-Windows users , the clipboard is where Windows stores the last item that you ' ve copied or cut. ) They ' re everywhere as shareware , and I use a cheapie ( because I am a cheapie ) called Yet Another Clipboard Collector . For top-of-the-line clipboard control , try ClipMate , also shareware . * Basically these handy little devils give the clipboard the ability to hold more_than one thing at a time . A good clipboard collector will store up everything you cut or copy and let you to go_back and choose which one you want to paste . ClipMate even lets you combine several clips into one large one . Thus , if you see http : / / www.onramp.net / shopping in ( a pretty cool World Wide Web shopping site , by the way ) and then see the gopher address una.hh.lib.umich.edu , you can just copy them to the clipboard one after the other and keep going . And by copying and pasting , rather than writing them down and typing them in again , you eliminate the chance of errors . Finally , if you do a lot of e-mailing , you might want to consider an off-line reader . If you use a BBS for your e-mail , you ' ll want one with &quot; .qwk &quot; support . This enables you to quickly retrieve all new mail and forum postings , log_off , and respond off-line , where you can read everything at your leisure . More Computer News * The TimesLink on-line service includes a large selection of articles and information about computers and technology in its Business section . Sign_on and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; Computer News. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4 ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Mailing Sights , Sounds in Windows To ease the task of e-mailing pictures , sounds , word-processor files and other binaries , try a clever little Windows utility called WinCode . Besides handling uuencoding and uudecoding with aplomb , the program will zip or unzip the file as well , without forcing you to do any work_at the DOS command_line . It supports drag and drop , too ; just click a file from File Manager and drag it over to the minimized WinCode icon . If you want , WinCode will even hook itself into another Windows application , creating a menu item in your telecommunications program , for example , so WinCode is always there for you . Uuencoding and uudecoding are built_in , but you ' ll need to get pkware on_your_own . Most impressive of all , WinCode is free , but without the usual Help file . If you want that , it ' s $ 5 , but the program comes_with a good help text_file , so it ' s not crucial . WinCode , from Snappy Inc. , is available on CompuServe , America Online and elsewhere .</TEXT>
