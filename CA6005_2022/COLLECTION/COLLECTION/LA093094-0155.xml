   <HEADLINE> LAX ARRIVALS WARNED ON SIGNS OF PLAGUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It seemed a bit out_of_place against the backdrop of modern-day jets , but passengers coming_to Los Angeles International Airport from India received warnings Thursday to watch_out for signs they had been exposed to plague , the deadly disease that ravaged Europe during the Middle_Ages . Federal health officers handed_out &quot; plague alert &quot; notices to passengers arriving on the one flight a day from India , a Delta Air Lines jet . It warned them to seek medical treatment if they develop plague-like symptoms , including nausea , vomiting and fever . Immigration officers also were issuing the warnings to Indian immigrants arriving on other flights . As is always required , flight_attendants on all international_flights have been instructed to notify health officials of all on-board illnesses . So far , there have been no reports in Los Angeles or any other U.S. city of any passengers with symptoms of the disease , according to health officials . Pneumonic plague -- a strain of the bubonic_plague or &quot; Black_Death &quot; that killed an estimated 25 million people , or one quarter of the population of Europe during the 14th Century -- has killed at least 48 people in India since last week . Dr. Shirley Fannin , director of disease control for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services , said earlier this week that she alerted hospital emergency_rooms to be_on the lookout for the disease . She also is preparing a contingency plan in the event of an outbreak here . The bubonic form of the disease is spread to humans by fleas that have bitten infected rats ; the pneumonic form is transmitted from one human to another . Both forms of the disease have been reported in India , the health warning says . People who are infected with the pneumonic form suffer high fevers , vomit blood and their lungs fill with fluid . Death occurs within three to four days . Despite its deadly reputation , plague can be cured if a victim is treated promptly with antibiotics . The notice says that the incubation_period of plague is usually two to seven days and advises anyone arriving from India who develops a fever to consult a physician .</TEXT>
