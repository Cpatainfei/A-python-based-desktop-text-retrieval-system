   <HEADLINE> HERO ROLE IN RIOTS PUSHES ACTOR ONTO A LARGER STAGE ; HUMAN RELATIONS : ' I can ' t BE A BYSTANDER ANYMORE , ' SAYS GREGORY ALAN-WILLIAMS . HE WRITES OF LIFE-JOLTING CHANGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Los Angeles during the riots two years ago , he saved a Japanese American man from being beaten to death . In New York last month , on_tour to promote his book about those moments , he saved a hotel bellman -- mostly from the bellman ' s own worst impulses . &quot; I can ' t be a bystander anymore , &quot; said Gregory Alan-Williams , explaining why he invited the black bellman , spouting anti-Semitic theories on the cause of the Holocaust , into his hotel_room for a chat . &quot; He was a very smart man who was a bellman -- that was part of his frustration . He was looking_for a scapegoat. &quot; Alan-Williams is a professional actor who walked into the real_world during the riots and finds he cannot go_back . Everything in his life has changed since he waded into the violence of Florence and Normandie -- a black_man acting &quot; under cover of darkness , &quot; he quips -- to rescue the badly beaten Takao Hirata from an angry mob . He dragged the dazed and profusely bleeding man on an almost Biblical trek from front lawn to front lawn , seeking refuge and being turned_away by residents gripped with fear or anger . After trusting a concerned motorist to take Hirata to a hospital , Alan-Williams emerged from the intersection a hero whose life was jolted out of its routine . His two-year marriage dissolved . He even parted ways -- amicably -- with his talent agency . But his biggest metamorphosis was into book author . He secretly toiled at his word_processor during the filming of &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; in which he played one of Clint Eastwood ' s fellow Secret Service agents . &quot; A Gathering of Heroes -- Reflections on Rage and Responsibility &quot; ( Academy Chicago Publishers ) exhaustively covers Alan-Williams ' day at Florence and Normandie ( there ' s even a map of his movements in the intersection ) , but more important , it chronicles the people -- the &quot; heroes &quot; of the title -- and events of_his_own past that compelled him to be more_than a bystander at the intersection . In the slender book , Alan-Williams , who still keeps_in occasional phone contact with Hirata , recalls being victim and victimizer . He talks_about being a young black boy in a predominantly white Des Moines , Iowa , junior_high_school , the kid who got whacked in the face after band practice while the other kids stood around and laughed . He also recalls himself as a young Marine recruit who joined others in his platoon in a brutal nighttime assault on a fellow Marine they considered inept and disgraceful . That image haunted him as he drove toward the riot flash_point , drawn by radio accounts of violence : Those who beat Rodney King , those who battered the people at Florence and Normandie , and those like me who participated in the beating of Private Ladieu -- we had all abandoned principle and decency in the self-serving name of order and justice . Even his sense of his vocation has changed since that day . In the wake of the book , now trickling into stores , he has found a new calling as a public_speaker . Whether he is talking at a Catholic high_school in Chicago or a community forum in Pasadena , where two_dozen people showed_up at small bookstore for an informal Saturday night chat with the author , he is blissfully in his element . &quot; I talk_about myself as a victim of intolerance and violence , as perpetrator , as bystander , and as rescuer , &quot; says Alan-Williams , whose sonorous voice has won him lucrative voice-over work and made_it easy to write a one-man theatrical show for himself , &quot; The Life and Times of Deacon A . L . Wiley. &quot; He plays a turn-of-the-century former slave sharing his life experiences and talking_about taking_control of_his_own destiny . He makes his living playing a beach cop on &quot; Baywatch , &quot; the syndicated television_show . It offers a pleasant working environment -- the beach -- but it ' s not about him ; it ' s about blond girls and David Hasselhoff . Few of Alan-Williams ' acting roles so far have fulfilled him . &quot; You do_it , you see it , and there ' s nothing left , &quot; he says . &quot; It leaves you very empty . that ' s why all this other ( book tour ) work is very welcome . . . . You can address issues. &quot; He sits in the den of his rented Hollywood hillside apartment , the drone of the freeway coming_through the open patio doors . At 37 , he is considering moving_back to his home state of Iowa for the summer and commuting for acting jobs or speaking engagements . ( &quot; I never liked L.A. , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a pit. &quot; ) The accolades have not erased nagging problems : Financial difficulties caused him to fall_behind in support_payments to three children by two different women . He struggles to pay the money back and uses the experience of unwed fatherhood in his speeches as a cautionary tale . ( &quot; I talk to young black_men about this all_the time. &quot; ) His divorce is bitter . His estranged wife , B . Sylestine Williams , a hairdresser , doubts his selflessness . &quot; He saved Tak Hirata ' s life . I ' m OK with that , &quot; she says , but &quot; he went there for his own self-aggrandizement. &quot; Alan-Williams ' former talent agency didn ' t see how his need to travel as a speaker dovetailed with its need to have him auditioning in L.A. The speaking trips also strained his marriage . &quot; I was away a lot , and I couldn ' t always bring my wife . I think there was a lot of fear . She saw me moving beyond . . . . As you can probably tell from the book , we ' re very different people. &quot; In the book , he recounts arriving home after the riots , covered in Hirata ' s blood , and his wife ' s observing his cut finger and his bedraggled condition : She took my hand in her lap . &quot; Is that his blood on you ? &quot; &quot; Yeah. &quot; &quot; Don ' t you think you oughta get checked ? &quot; &quot; Checked ? For what ? &quot; &quot; Hepatitis . . . HIV. &quot; . . . Syleste and I argued back and forth for a while . I told her that her concerns were cynical and ridiculous . She was getting_on my nerves . &quot; Do you think God would let me get_away with what I got_away with out there and then let me get AIDS ! &quot; I yelled . Legions of publishers turned_down his manuscript . And the small company that did pick it up found some bookstores uninterested , particularly in riot-weary Los Angeles . For one thing , the author ' s interpretations did not seem politically correct to those who viewed the riots as a righteous rebellion , years in the making . By the second day of the Los Angeles Riots , I was absolutely livid with rage . I had witnessed firsthand . . . the consequences of intolerance and unchecked anger . Yet folks were running_around screaming about uprisings and revolutions -- seemingly unable or unwilling to make distinctions between legitimate protests against systemic injustice , and terrorism . His publisher sent him on a book tour that largely skipped Los Angeles . &quot; I got the vibe that people think it was a revolution and a good thing , &quot; said Paul Bennett , the publisher ' s marketing director . Alan-Williams shrugged it off . &quot; I told Paul early on , ' First of all , don ' t nobody want to hear about them riots , ' &quot; he said . &quot; And secondly , everybody writes a book . This is a very cynical town. &quot; Esowon , one of the city ' s most prominent African American bookstores , declined to carry the book . &quot; When I read the little synopsis , it just didn ' t sound very interesting , &quot; says co-owner James Fugate . He added wearily , &quot; The local authors always feel the local bookstore should sell their book. &quot; Midnight Special , a Santa Monica store specializing in political social_science , agreed to a book-signing only after Bennett pleaded with them . ( &quot; I was desperate , &quot; he recalls. ) In the end , Alan-Williams had to cancel -- he was filming an episode of &quot; L.A. Law. &quot; &quot; I had a lot of reservations about whether we would get folks to it if we did , &quot; says Cynthia Cuza of Midnight Special . &quot; I think he misses the point . . . . The folks that were at the intersection of Florence and Normandie have had years of legitimate complaints and it was a spontaneous uprising. &quot; But she relented , she says , because &quot; part of what we do is give first-time authors an opportunity. &quot; Other stores had no problem with the book . The Black and Latino Multicultural Center in Pasadena held a book-signing . Book Soup ordered 10 copies . So did Dutton ' s in Brentwood . Crown Books bought 250 to spread around its 68 L.A.-area stores . &quot; I did read the book , I loved it , &quot; said Miriam Bass , Crown ' s assistant vice_president for merchandising on the West Coast . &quot; I moved here when I was 7 . I love reading about the city , problems and all. &quot; When Alan-Williams speaks , he doesn ' t mince words preaching self-discipline and control of one ' s own destiny . His listeners can be just as blunt . &quot; Why , &quot; one disgruntled black_man wrote after Alan-Williams gave a talk in Brookline , Mass. , at the invitation of a human relations group , &quot; do you keep bringing_in these Uncle Clarence Thom-as niggers ? &quot; That hurt , Alan-Williams said . &quot; My question to him would be , ' Why didn ' t you say that when I was there ? I invited dialogue . Why are you such a punk that you won ' t even write the letter to me ? You write it to the white people. ' &quot; During the Reginald O . Denny beating trial , Alan-Williams was asked on the witness_stand to identify Damian Williams , later convicted of attacking Denny , as one of Takao Hirata ' s assailants . He couldn ' t . In the madness , he said , he had never had a good look_at any of the suspects ' faces . While he was_on the stand , Damian Williams winked_at him . He winked back . &quot; I had been wanting to make a connection with Mr. Williams , &quot; he says . &quot; We were kept so separate . In the public_eye , in the eye of the prosecution , these were monsters and I was a hero . They wanted to cut me off . And this is what black folks suspect about my book -- they don ' t think I understand that this is how people are separated from one another : You are good . They are bad . We love you . We don ' t love them . I love them . And I love Hirata . Because I love Hirata doesn ' t mean I have to stop loving them. &quot;</TEXT>
