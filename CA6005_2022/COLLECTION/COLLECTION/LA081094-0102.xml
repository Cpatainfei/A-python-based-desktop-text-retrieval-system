   <HEADLINE> THE FAMILY FILE : ' 90S FAMILY ; REFILLING THE EMPTY NEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An increasing number of grandparents are being forced to cope_with the fact that their empty nests are being filled by grandchildren for whom they must care . More_than 3.3 million children live with grandparents who are their primary caregivers or legal_guardians , a 41 % increase over 1980 , according to Census_Bureau figures reported in Good Housekeeping . While many older people provide day_care for their grandchildren to assist working parents , growing numbers of grandparents seek custody of the children because the parents neglect them , suffer from mental or emotional problems , abuse drugs or alcohol , or -- in the case of teen-age pregnancies -- are too young to assume child-care responsibilities . Raising grandchildren can mean delaying or giving_up long-awaited retirement_plans . &quot; One day , they ' ve remodeled their house or purchased a motor_home -- the next day they ' re child-proofing cabinets or planning a child ' s birthday_party , &quot; said Margaret Platt Jendrek , a Miami University professor studying the issue for the American Assn . of Retired Persons . Preventive Education Early learning experiences , which for many children can determine school success or failure , are the focus of the new Task_Force on Learning in the Primary Grades , formed by the Carnegie Corp . of New York . The task_force , made_up of leaders in education , business , government services and the media , will study the education of children 3 to 10 . Conclusions and recommendations will be reported within two years . &quot; Our premise is that the causes of educational failure for most children are largely preventable , &quot; said Dr. David A . Hamburg , the corporation ' s president . &quot; Given high-quality , developmentally appropriate activities at school or at_home and in the larger community , most children will succeed up_to their ability . The question is how to create the conditions for educational success on a large-enough scale to reach virtually all children. &quot; Gay_Men Rate Love Over Sex Gay_men are more interested in romance and long-term relationships than in sex , according to a survey by a gay-oriented magazine . The results from the survey by the Advocate came from 13 # 000 responses received from its readers . The survey found that 80 % of gay and bisexual men would rather live without sex than without love . Seventy-one percent also said they prefer long-term monogamous relationships to other arrangements . &quot; Popular images of gay_men emphasize the quest_for sexual gratification and underplay the quest_for romance and companionship , but the results of this survey contradict that image , &quot; said Janet Lever , associate_professor of sociology at Cal State University , Los Angeles , who analyzed the results . Picking Names Instead of Burdens In Child magazine , Albert Mehrabian of Los Angeles , author of &quot; The Name Game , &quot; and Dr. H . David Stein , an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons , offer new parents these pointers for choosing a winning name : * Steer clear of names with ugly or sexual connotations . * Try not to choose names that rhyme . * Be wary of names with strange or difficult spellings . * Test each name by saying it aloud or using different permutations to make_sure it ' s not problematic , such_as Kristal Chandelier . * If you must use a name because it is a family tradition but it seems a bit outdated or burdensome , allow your child to choose a middle name or a nickname to use every day . * Seek names that can be a source of pride or that sound friendly , outgoing , savvy or intelligent .</TEXT>
