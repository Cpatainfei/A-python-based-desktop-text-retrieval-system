   <HEADLINE> BUFFALO SHUFFLE OFF ; REMAINING BISON AT OLD IRVINE THEME PARK SITE SOLD TO MAKE_WAY FOR ROAD REALIGNMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> His name is Happy and he ' s a 1 # 600-pound American_bison . On Sunday , he was chomping on alfalfa strands while an auctioneer ' s rapid-fire cadences pierced the air here . The auctioneer , standing on a bale of hay , sang , &quot; $ 2 # 000 , $ 2 # 000 , do I hear $ 2 # 100 ? &quot; Happy took a_few more bites , then shook his head with such force that dried mud flew off his furry mane , creating a ring of dust around his head and horns . When the auctioneer finally announced , &quot; Sold for $ 2 # 000 ! &quot; Happy and fellow bison Lucky and Rainbow were rolling in the muddy pasture , unaware that they had just been sold , unaware that a long tradition in Orange County had just ended . To make_way for the realignment of Ford Road , the remaining buffalo at the Buffalo Ranch , a defunct 1950s theme park that has been an office complex for years , were sold by owner William Lange with all proceeds going_to local charities . John R . Cogorno , a Westminster criminal defense_attorney and part-time rancher , bought the burly bison for his 10-acre ranch in Lancaster . Cogorno said he is fulfilling a dream to own a true American original and to start his own herd of buffalo . &quot; I ' ve always loved the West and am happy to be buying and preserving a part of it , &quot; Cogorno , 48 , said . He said he wants to breed the animals , then move them to a larger ranch in Wyoming . The sale of Happy , Lucky and Rainbow ends the long role in local history buffalo have played_at MacArthur Boulevard and Ford Road . In the mid-1950s , innovative entrepreneur Gene Clark imported 100 bison from Kansas and released the herd onto 100 acres of the hilly terrain he rented from the Irvine Co . Hoping to create one of Orange County ' s first theme parks , Clark added a kiddie train ride_on the property , set_up an Indian village , kept livestock in a barn and sold buffalo burgers and handicrafts from his newly named &quot; Buffalo Ranch. &quot; People paid per carload to drive across a winding road on the property in a Lion Country Safari-type experience . Newport Beach Historical Society President Bill Grundy , 70 , remembers taking a carful of kids through the ranch when it was in its prime . &quot; We had a Ford convertible at the time , and I remember once there was a big bull on one side and the herd on the other . I drove_in the middle and the bull got so close to the car , I could see it frothing . I said , ' Look , kids , ' but they were_on the floorboard , hiding behind the seats , &quot; Grundy said . The Buffalo Ranch was short-lived . In a_few years , all that remained was an empty red barn and adjoining silo . Clark sent all_the buffalo back to Kansas . The buildings sat unused until architect William L . Pereira drove past the facility in 1960 while working_on the master development plans for the city of Irvine . Pereira , whose works included the Transamerica Building in San Francisco and Los Angeles International Airport , fell_in_love with the barn ' s rustic charm and he moved_in drafting tables to create a satellite office of William L . Pereira Associates . He later added several smaller barrack-style buildings to the site . In 1983 , Pereira sold the buildings to William Lange , who has since headquartered his real_estate business at the site . Five years later , Lange brought two buffalo from Colorado to a corral behind the five-acre property to revive the buffalo ' s heritage at the site and to give his young children a taste of the country , Lange said . The Irvine Co. , which still owns the land , will not extend Lange ' s lease when it expires this month . Instead , Lange is moving his offices to a newer building in Newport Beach , and the land will be used for the realignment of Ford Road , which will eventually connect with the 15-mile San Joaquin Transportation Corridor . The red ranch-style buildings have been designated as historic structures and are protected from demolition . An Irvine Co . spokeswoman said the firm is still deciding what to do with the land . When he decided to sell the buffalo , Lange wanted to make_sure the animals would be kept alive . To qualify , bidders first had to guarantee that no bison would be slaughtered . &quot; I would ' ve taken $ 500 , if it was the only bid which I knew for_sure the bison would be taken_care of , &quot; Lange said . Cogorno said he would never consider entering the lucrative buffalo meat market . &quot; I can ' t imagine killing something so beautiful , so American , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
