   <HEADLINE> POLICE , CITY TO USE MEDIATOR IN NEGOTIATIONS ; LABOR : FRIDAY IS SET AS TARGET FOR ACCORD . UNION AGREES TO SUSPEND JOB ACTIONS AND NOT TO GATHER INFORMATION ON COUNCIL_MEMBERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what is considered a major breakthrough in the stalled labor negotiations between Los Angeles police and the city , both sides agreed Monday to bring a mediator into the talks and to set Friday as the target date for reaching a contract agreement . Union officials said the agreement Monday would mean a suspension of any job actions by police_officers , such_as the &quot; blue flu &quot; sickout last week that disrupted staffing throughout the city and that officers threatened to repeat during the upcoming World Cup soccer matches . Also to be eliminated , the union said , is the &quot; information gathering &quot; on City_Council members that was threatened late last week by union officials . City_Council members likened the threat to blackmail and a number of civil_rights organizations joined forces Monday to denounce it . The compromise , reached shortly before 5 p.m. Monday , came as the city said it was about to declare an impasse in the talks . The police union reversed its position and agreed to the mediator late in the day , only a_few minutes before Mayor Richard Riordan was to read a statement declaring the talks deadlocked . As a concession to the union , the mediator will be called a &quot; neutral third_party settlement adviser. &quot; The union ' s acceptance of a mediator was seen as an important step_in the stalled talks , coming just days after union leaders rejected a similar offer . The union had said previously that it would agree only to binding arbitration , not a mediator or settlement judge who would not have the legal_power to resolve the_matter . Danny Staggs , president of the Police Protective League , said in a prepared statement that an impasse would have been counterproductive for both sides . &quot; We have agreed that both parties will be committed to the outcome , &quot; he said . &quot; I believe negotiating is a form of give_and_take . I believe the City_Council and the mayor took a step_forward by saying they would be committed to it. &quot; Monday had its share of drama , as the negotiations reached critical_points at which they could have broken_down . The city was prepared to declare an impasse at 10 a.m. That decision was then put_off until 2 p.m. Finally , at 4:55 p.m. , five minutes before the city was to announce the deadlock , the union agreed to accept a mediator . In the course of Monday ' s negotiations , the union demanded that the city meet 11 conditions before a mediator was accepted . These ranged from amnesty for those who participated in the sickout to confidentiality for all future negotiations . But the city would agree to only two of the demands -- that the talks be held at a neutral site and that they remain confidential . The city also insisted that the union denounce any protests by officers that target City_Council members . The mediator will be chosen jointly . Staggs said he expected that an agreement on a new contract could be reached by the Friday target date , presuming both sides quickly agree on the settlement adviser . &quot; We ' re looking_for people who have experience in that field , &quot; he said . Earlier in the day , a coalition of civil_rights groups , led by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , directed highly critical remarks toward the police union negotiators , characterizing their threat to dig_up dirt on City_Council members as &quot; strong-arm tactics. &quot; In reply , union spokesman Geoffrey Garfield said the threat to release embarrassing information about council_members was nothing more_than &quot; opposition research &quot; designed to push_forward the negotiations that have been stalled for two years . The group of seven civil_rights representatives said they were troubled by the threats , which included the suggestion that the police might picket council_members ' homes and purchase billboard space to draw attention to the protracted negotiations . The concern about the gathering of embarrassing information on council_members was reflected in Riordan ' s prepared statement of impasse -- one he did not issue -- in which he referred to &quot; unprecedented threats made by league board_members against the mayor and individual members of the city_council and their personal privacy. &quot;</TEXT>
