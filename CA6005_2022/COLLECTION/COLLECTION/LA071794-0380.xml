   <HEADLINE> BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN ; HOW IT IS THAT ' SCIENTIFIC ' SURVEYS ' RESULTS CAN BE POLLS APART</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> George H . Gallup , an inventor of modern opinion polling , idealistically believed that surveys of the public would enhance democracy by providing leaders with a true picture of peoples ' attitudes and concerns . Sixty years have gone_by , and polls are now as common as Big Macs on the American landscape . But their effect remains dubious at best , as does the effect of the burgeoning number of studies of all types that are now part of every public policy debate . In theory , research using the scientific_method tries to measure a phenomenon ( such_as public_opinion , health risk or environmental impact ) in the most objective manner possible . Of course , nothing is ever completely unbiased . But good researchers strive for that goal . There ' s ample room for their efforts . Public policy debates abound with myths and ideology , often based on nothing but hearsay . Good research can cut_through these shibboleths and keep the press and policy_makers from making wrong assumptions . Lately , for example , careful polling has shown the lack of evidence for the existence of an angry , alienated Generation X , that mythical group of twentysomethings so beloved by scores of feature writers . Unfortunately , an increasing amount of research is being conducted to support particular myths rather than to seek objective answers . In her new book &quot; Tainted Truth : The Manipulation of Fact in America , &quot; Wall_Street Journal writer Cynthia Crossen chronicles the ominous rise of this &quot; tactical &quot; or &quot; advocacy &quot; research , in which groups wanting to advance their agendas commission supposedly objective studies that almost always end_up supporting their positions on an issue . Crossen cites numerous examples , including a research battle between advocates of cloth and disposable diapers , in which each side weighed in with impressive environmental impact studies showing diametrically opposite results . According to Crossen , advocacy research is &quot; contributing to the steady degradation of social discourse on the major political , economic and environmental issues of the day. &quot; Anyone listening to media debates on health_care , illegal immigration , abortion or the North_American Free_Trade Agreement could agree . Each side seems to have its own ready-made version of statistical reality , one the total opposite of the other . When tactical research is identified as sponsored , the observer can at least consider the source and tread warily . More insidious , perhaps , are the occasions in which advocates manipulate independent findings or cite only selected research results to advance a cause . Such a charge was recently leveled at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , which has been accused of using some questionable techniques to determine that secondhand cigarette smoke is a Class A carcinogen . The EPA ' s actions drew a not-surprising attack from the tobacco_industry . But they also earned criticism from the Congressional Research Service , which has raised doubts about some of the methodology . Nonetheless , this research remains the basis for the government ' s goal to ban smoking in virtually all workplaces . A different but equally worrisome trend is the growing use of unscientific &quot; gimmick &quot; studies , primarily for promotion , publicity or &quot; just for fun. &quot; Evidence of this is the recent revival by CBS and NBC news_programs of the long-discredited 900-number call-in technique . Such call-ins produce biased , unrepresentative findings , and can be manipulated by interest_groups manning phone banks . Both networks maintain top-notch polling units that can deliver sound scientific surveys in hours . But these lack the dramatic allure of letting the audience vote during the program . The result is the airing of scurrilous data that misleads rather than informs . In the same sphere are the new so-called on-line &quot; polls , &quot; in which subscribers to on-line computer_systems log_in their views to a question and the system reports the results . These are particularly skewed : Computer on-line systems are currently used by only a fraction of the country , yet findings often are reported as if they represent America as_a_whole . The public -- and much of the press -- has a hard_time discerning that fact . One might expect journalists to sound the alarm about the pitfalls of bad research . Many -- such_as Crossen -- are doing just that . But the industry as_a_whole does a woefully inadequate job . Impressive-looking studies are treated as breaking news . And competitive pressures often push news people to &quot; go_with it now and ask questions later. &quot; Although much good research is being done , we are a long way from George Gallup ' s dream of survey-assisted democracy . On the contrary , it is the average citizen who must be_on guard to judge cautiously the dizzying array of statistics coming his or her way .</TEXT>
