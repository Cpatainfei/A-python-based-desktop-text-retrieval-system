   <HEADLINE> WITH U.N. APPROVAL , SHIP BRINGS FUEL TO HAITI ; EMBARGO : AUTHORIZED DELIVERY IS MEANT TO EASE THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON THE POOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A faded red tanker slipped into Port-au-Prince ' s harbor at dawn Friday and unloaded 400 # 000 gallons of gasoline and diesel_fuel in an officially sanctioned violation of the economic embargo of Haiti ' s military dictatorship . The shipment was authorized by the United Nations under pressure from the United States , which is concerned that public revulsion over the deadly impact of the sanctions on Haiti ' s desperately poor majority could ultimately weaken the Clinton_Administration ' s effort to force the military out of power . Haiti has been under an international boycott since mid-October , when the military reneged_on an agreement to permit the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who has lived_in exile in the United States since his violent overthrow in 1991 . Rather than force the military to accept Aristide ' s return , however , the embargo , particularly against the importation of fuel , has all but destroyed the country ' s economy and infrastructure and has pushed much of the impoverished majority to -- if not over -- the edge of starvation . That situation led the United States to ease the embargo and permit enough fuel in to allow such groups as CARE , Catholic Relief Services and others to restore deteriorating feeding programs . The tanker , named the Eupleta Douglas and accompanied by a destroyer sent by the United Nations , was tied_up to the petroleum dock for no more_than nine hours in hopes of avoiding threatened efforts to prevent either its docking or unloading . The day passed without incident , unlike the events of Oct . 11 , when a U.S. military cargo_ship , the Harlan County , was prevented from landing and unloading unarmed Army_engineers and road-building equipment by a rampaging mob sponsored by Haiti ' s military_leaders . Despite threats to repeat the Harlan County episode , no attempts were made to keep the Eupleta Douglas away from the unloading pipe or to interfere with the pumping operation . But the danger is not over , according to diplomats , even though the military high_command has pledged not to interfere with the distribution of the fuel -- 300 # 000 gallons of which is dedicated strictly to non-governmental humanitarian agencies . &quot; The great fear now , &quot; one diplomat said , &quot; is when they ( the humanitarian groups ) come_to get the gas . There is no way we can protect them ; they will be_on their own. &quot; Various groups , all virulently anti-Aristide , have threatened to stop trucks trying to pick_up the fuel or even to steal it on grounds that the distribution is not truly equitable . According to U.N. spokesman Erik Falk , starting Monday approved agencies will be allowed to buy specified amounts of fuel for $ 1.20 a gallon , with smaller groups getting 100 gallons and larger ones , such_as CARE , as much as 20 # 000 gallons . With 100 # 000 gallons being kept_in reserve for emergencies , the remaining 300 # 000 is supposed to last two months . According to Douglas Greene of Catholic Relief Services , the fuel will permit his organization to resume two feedings a day for the 170 # 000 people it serves in Port-au-Prince and nearby cities . Officials of CARE , which normally provides daily meals to about 600 # 000 people , mostly in the impoverished northwest , said they had been forced by a lack of fuel to cut_back to feeding only 200 # 000 on some days . The new shipment , if it holds together , will enable CARE to restore its program at least until mid-February . One segment of Haiti that has survived is the bull ' s-eye of the embargo target : the military . According to diplomats and other sources close to the army high_command , the military has about 200 # 000 gallons of fuel in storage and is smuggling in enough from the neighboring Dominican_Republic to resell at a large profit . &quot; The border is leaking like a sieve , &quot; one foreign military expert said . &quot; The military is selling it to the country ' s electric and telephone_companies and then using part of the profits to pay its soldiers . &quot; They don ' t care about the people , and as far as I can tell they have no plans to deal with , let alone solve , the conflict with the world. &quot;</TEXT>
