   <TEXT> A car_bomb exploded Sunday evening outside an office belonging_to Sinn Fein , the political wing of the IRA , in the Roman_Catholic Falls Road area of Belfast , and a Protestant extremist group took responsibility . Police said no one was injured in the explosion , which could be heard across town and which blew_out nearby windows . The outlawed Protestant extremist Ulster Volunteer Force said it was responsible_for the blast . Sinn Fein denounced the bombing as an attempt to provoke the IRA into breaking a cease-fire announced last week . It was the first bomb attack since Irish_Republican_Army guerrillas , campaigning to oust Britain from Northern_Ireland , announced the cease-fire Wednesday . On Thursday , another outlawed Protestant group , the Ulster Freedom Fighters , shot a Catholic man to death . Police say both groups are stepping_up attacks and could be targeting Catholics to assure supporters they will not endorse any British government concessions to the IRA .</TEXT>
