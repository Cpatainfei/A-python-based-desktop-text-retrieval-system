   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO ISSUE VISAS TO GAY GAMES PARTICIPANTS WITH AIDS VIRUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration will allow foreigners with the virus that causes AIDS to attend the Gay Games in New York in June . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno approved a waiver Tuesday to the rule barring people with the AIDS virus from entering the United States . Visas granted under the waiver will allow stays of up_to 10 days . The Gay Games take eight days . Two additional days were allotted for travel . Reno acted after the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention advised her there was no public health reason to prohibit the brief stay , and the Department of Health and Human Services determined that visits up_to 90 days would not harm public health . &quot; This is good news for people with AIDS and for people who oppose discrimination , and we are very , very happy , &quot; said Gregory King , spokesman for the Human_Rights Campaign Fund , a gay lobbying group . Between 10 # 000 and 15 # 000 athletes and spectators from more_than 40 countries are expected to attend the Gay Games , from June 18-25 , according to a State_Department cable obtained by the Associated Press last month . The games overlap related events that week , including the 16th annual International Lesbian and Gay Assn . world conference and Stonewall 25 , a celebration of the 25th anniversary of a gay customer-police confrontation at the Stonewall Inn , a bar in Greenwich_Village , New York . &quot; Short-term visits present minimal risk , &quot; said Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner , who recommended the waiver on the basis of the HHS determination . Waivers have been used in the past to permit HIV-infected foreigners to attend academic and scientific conferences , obtain medical treatment , visit family members and complete temporary business . Those seeking visas would not be required to state their HIV status but must show proof , such_as tickets , of their intent to attend or participate in the Gay Games IV and Cultural Festival , said Justice spokeswoman Ana Cobian . U.S. policy denies visas to anyone with a communicable_disease of public health significance , including HIV , which causes AIDS . That restriction led planners to move the annual International Conference on AIDS from Boston to the_Netherlands in 1992 .</TEXT>
