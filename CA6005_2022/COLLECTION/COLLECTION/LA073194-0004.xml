   <TEXT> Although Katy Butler might have made more clear why Gary Romona won in the landmark repressed-memory trial , she did clarify the issues ( &quot; A House Divided , &quot; June 26 ) . But she failed to challenge the now conventional wisdom in the debate -- that there are only two options regarding those memories : They are either true or false . A third option should not be ignored , one that is associated with Freud . These memories may be remembered fantasies , part of the childhood dream world , inspired by the natural attraction of children for the parent of the opposite sex . Repression of fantasies occurs when the child senses that the fantasies and the feelings they spring from are too threatening . ( The child feels that the parent of the same sex would harm him or her if he or she knew. ) That option would account_for the difficulty of retrieving the memories . Few remember fantasies easily , but those who were in fact victims of childhood sexual abuse never forget it . It also would account_for the connection between the memories and later emotional and even physical problems , since those can be caused by the repression of such a basic part of the self as sexual feeling . DOUGLAS M . PARROTT Riverside * In trying to strike a balance between the stories of Ramona and his daughter , Butler forgot the journalist ' s most important role : to report the truth . Commentator Edward R . Murrow did not try to strike a balance between Joe McCarthy and the senator ' s falsely accused victims . Was there a balance between the so-called witches of Salem and their accusers ? Butler cites one scientific study that &quot; proves that some instances of recovered memory are credible. &quot; Yet , a closer review shows that the study was not about recovered memory at all . The child-abuse hysteria , beginning with the McMartin day-care case a decade ago , has lasted longer than any other episode of hysteria in American history and destroyed thousands of American families . If you don ' t know the major role The Times has already played in promoting this hysteria , I suggest a review of its admitted misreporting of the McMartin case . The Times has a special responsibility to get this story right . Too_much is at stake for the true victims of this hysteria . ROBERT LIGON La Crescenta * The most chilling statement in Butler ' s article was : &quot; In July , Holly will complete work_on her MA in clinical_psychology at Pepperdine University ; she wants to work with abused children. &quot; Neither experts nor Holly can figure_out what did or did not happen to her . Her history of problems has left her confused , angry , distraught and troubled . That Holly could possibly get_into a position where she can influence the mental_state of young , hurt and easily manipulated children is unthinkable . MARILYN ANITA DALRYMPLE Lancaster * While Butler does a good job at placing the Ramona trial in its historical context and discussing the issues underlying its great interest , she also showed a subtle bias and a rather naive acceptance of unsubstantiated claims about traumatic memory . One example of bias was in the description of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation , which was formed , Butler says , when &quot; there were enough agonized fathers protesting their innocence to spawn a support group . . . . &quot; What she neglected to say was that the foundation was formed by a group of families and professionals who were concerned about questionable therapeutic practices . She omits the fact that the foundation ' s Scientific Advisory Board includes some of the most prestigious memory researchers in the country and the world . Butler frames her discussion in terms of &quot; fathers , &quot; leaving_out the information that 40 % of the accusations of abuse are against mothers . As for unsubstantiated claims about traumatic memory , Dr. Lenore Terr ' s testimony that a person ' s dislike of bananas and whole pickles is a sign of past sexual abuse has no validity . And while the Linda Meyer Williams research is an advance in the methodology of studying memories of past sexual abuse , it in no way can be said to provide &quot; scientific support for the proposition &quot; that there is any special mental mechanism that operates in traumatic situations . If Butler would read the Williams study with greater_care she ' d note , for example , that a majority of the 38 % of women did not say that they had not been abused , but rather they told about abuse situations other_than the particular one the researchers had_in_mind . Butler also neglected to mention that both the American Psychiatric Assn . and the American Medical Assn . have said that in cases of recovered memory &quot; there is no completely accurate way of determining the validity of reports in the absence of corroborating information. &quot; PAMELA FREYD EXECUTIVE_DIRECTOR FALSE MEMORY SYNDROME FOUNDATION Philadelphia * Butler replies : Thanks to Pamela Freyd for setting the record straight . Among the members of her foundation accused of sexual abuse , a significant percentage are mothers . Although sociologists say the majority of reports of child sexual abuse involve men , I should have spoken_of &quot; accused parents , &quot; not &quot; accused fathers. &quot; Turning_to Freyd ' s assessment that I show &quot; a subtle bias &quot; and a lack of knowl edge of memory research , I suggest that what is unknown about the workings of memory , by everyone , far outweighs the known . Neuroscientists , clinicians and cognitive psychologists all describe small pieces of the puzzle in their own specialized languages , but a specific consensus on facts , models and precise neural mechanisms does not exist . There are , however , many anecdotal reports from clinicians , as well as research by Terr and Elizabeth Loftus that trauma produces distortions of memory . Terr is a nationally respected researcher who studied children who suffered the publicly acknowledged trauma of the Chowchilla kidnaping . Many of those children suffered distortions of memory , remembering , for example , a female or a black kidnaper rather than three young white_men . I stated that Terr ' s assessment of Holly was based on her entire clinical picture , including her physical symptoms , fears , nightmares , sexual and social functioning , psychological test responses and other factors . To reduce her assessment to a single , easily parodied reference_to &quot; bananas and whole pickles &quot; seems unfair . Regarding the Williams study , Freyd is correct that of the women who did not recall the child sexual abuse that brought them into the study , 68 % told of other sexual_assaults ( involving different perpetrators and circumstances ) experienced in their childhood . However , any report of abuse by the offender whose actions had brought the women into a city emergency_room as children was counted by Williams as remembering the abuse , even if it involved different dates and circumstances .</TEXT>
