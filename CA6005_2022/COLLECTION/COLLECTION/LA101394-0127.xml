   <HEADLINE> EYE ON THE PRIZE ; GLEEFUL OFFICIALS AND FACULTY HOPE USC ' S FIRST NOBEL WILL HELP THE CAMPUS FINALLY SHED STEREOTYPE AS AN ACADEMIC LIGHTWEIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Across the USC campus the news that chemistry professor George A . Olah brought the university its first Nobel Prize was greeted Wednesday with joy and grateful relief . There is , it seems , nothing like the first time . USC has lots of Heismans in its trophy_case but desperately wanted a Nobel . &quot; It was , &quot; one USC official commented dryly , &quot; like an unscratched itch. &quot; Never again would USC face the indignity of being left_off the list of major California institutions with Nobel laureates on their faculties . Stanford has won 14 Nobel prizes , Caltech 12 . Even cross-town rival UCLA boasts three . And now , the 114-year-old University of Southern California . &quot; Certainly , this university has wanted a Nobel winner for some time , &quot; USC ' s president , Steven B . Sample , exclaimed Wednesday in something of an understatement . The prize , said faculty and students , gives USC powerful ammunition against old and annoying jibes about its image as the University of Spoiled Children , or worse , the University of Second Choice for serious academics . Although it is unlikely that Olah will ever be more famous than USC alum O.J. Simpson , the Nobel was welcomed as a deserved dose of academic acclaim for a school better known for its gridiron exploits . Olah joined USC in 1977 , already renowned in the chemistry field for work that led to cleaner-burning gasoline and advances in oil refining . Sample said he was pleased that the prize was awarded the year after a $ 120-million gift from Walter B . Annenberg for communications programs at USC , one of the largest grants in the history of higher education . Combined , the Nobel and the Annenberg grant &quot; will have a synergistic effect . That will be very helpful in student recruitment , fund raising and faculty recruitment , &quot; USC ' s president said . Not surprisingly , perhaps , USC ' s dean of admissions and financial_aid , thought ahead to this Saturday ' s football game with Stanford when he savored the prize . Why not , said Joseph Allen , have the USC marching band spell_out the word &quot; Olah &quot; on the playing_field ? After all , the Stanford band has taunted USC ' s academic reputation in the past by forming the average SAT scores of Trojan freshmen , which traditionally lag behind Stanford ' s scores . &quot; It ' s wonderful to have this new symbolism , &quot; Allen said of the Nobel . &quot; It ' s strong evidence that this is a place that has improved its academic quality and is committed to keeping that going. &quot; David Merkowitz , public affairs director of American Council on Education in Washington , agreed that the Nobel will boost USC ' s national reputation . &quot; Having a Nobel laureate on the faculty is a sign of enhancement , &quot; he said . &quot; And I ' m sure they will use it for good measure in terms of recruiting and marketing. &quot; In recent years , USC has been pushing for admission into the big_leagues of national and international research universities . The school , whose main 150-acre campus is located south of Downtown , ranks about 20th among American universities in the amount of federal research aid it receives , $ 225 million annually . Five years before UCLA was admitted to the Assn . of American Universities , USC won entrance in 1969 to that premiere organization of research institutions , whose membership now totals just 56 schools . More recently , the university has been seeking to bolster the reputation of its undergraduate programs , which long have been the butt -- justified or not -- of in-house criticism and jokes from rivals Stanford and UCLA . Slightly more_than half of USC ' s 27 # 864 students are undergraduates . The current crop of USC freshmen averages SAT score totals just over 1100 , a rise of about 100 points over a decade ago although still well below Stanford ' s or UCLA ' s . And counter to the image of an overwhelmingly affluent student body , 60 % of USC students receive some financial_aid to help with tuition and living costs that can total more_than $ 22 # 000 a year . Olah alluded to USC ' s changing image in remarks to his chemistry_department colleagues hours after getting the phone_call from Sweden on Wednesday morning . &quot; I think you should have a balance in any institution , and USC is maturing , combining a first-class science and medical research effort with a successful athletic program , &quot; he said . Later in the day , several hundred faculty , staff and students gathered for a champagne reception at which Olah was applauded for more_than a minute as he stood at the podium . &quot; I am so excited I am speechless , &quot; said Katherine B . Loker , an alumnus who in 1990 donated $ 7 million to Olah ' s research . &quot; When we first met him , I knew he was a Nobel Prize individual. &quot; Ironically , the Nobel may have its most important effect in Southern California , USC officials said Wednesday . In some respects , the university is more respected out of state than locally , partly because of the cross-town shadow cast by UCLA and Caltech . &quot; In some ways , it ' s harder to be recognized in your own back yard , &quot; said Morton Schapiro , an economist who is USC ' s dean of letters , arts and sciences . He forecast future Nobels for USC faculty , a game usually played by those other local schools . &quot; It ' s good to get your first , but there will be other ones , &quot; Schapiro said .</TEXT>
