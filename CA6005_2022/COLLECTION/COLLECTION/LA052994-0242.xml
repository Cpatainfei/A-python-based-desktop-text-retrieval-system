   <HEADLINE> SUPERCOMPUTER ' S FORECASTS ARE A BREEZE ; TECHNOLOGY : WEATHER SERVICE ' S CRAY C90 DOES 15 BILLION CALCULATIONS PER SECOND . IT PREDICTS CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It analyzes upper air wind two weeks ahead . It can calculate and compare 42 different weather_forecasts at once . It can do 15 billion math operations per second . But to someone standing in front of the National Weather Service ' s new Cray C90 computer , the machine seems disarmingly simple . A screen that says it ' s running , and a_few buttons , the main ones labeled &quot; start &quot; and &quot; stop. &quot; Shouldn ' t it be a little more complicated than that , Cray President John Carlson was asked . &quot; When you push start , it knows what to do , &quot; he replied . It lets National Weather Service meteorologists flex their numerical muscles with blinding speed . The C90 can slice the country into bits , analyze the weather and calculate how it will change . It ' s the fastest such computer in_service anywhere , Carlson says . &quot; We have , in_effect , stepped into a new era , &quot; said Commerce_Secretary Ron Brown after snipping a ribbon in front of the computer . &quot; Each day in this country there are hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions , of decisions made based on the weather_forecast , &quot; explained Ronald D . McPherson , director of the National Meteorological Center . Those decisions range from whether to send a child to school with a raincoat to planting rot-resistant seed to permitting barge traffic on the Mississippi_River , he said . &quot; The information on which those decisions are based comes from the Cray C90 , &quot; McPherson said . The $ 45-million machine joins a Cray Y-MP8 computer , purchased in 1990 , which could only do 2.5 billion calculations a second . The older model will concentrate_on research now , with the new one handling the daily forecasts for the National Weather Service . The national weather_forecasts , which local offices use as the basis of city and area forecasts , are based on complex sets of calculations that use mathematical formulas to mimic the behavior of the atmosphere . These are called numerical models . Some models look_at the atmosphere as a series of waves -- waves of wind , waves of heat , waves of pressure . Others use grids to divide the world into squares . They measure the weather and try to predict what it will do next . The faster computer lets the work be done more quickly and also permits the computer to look_at the nation more closely . For example , the old computer was able to look_at the country in squares about 50 miles across . The new one reduces the squares to less than 25 miles , and officials hope to reduce them even more . The new computer is already calculating changes in upper air winds -- at about 30 # 000 feet where airliners fly -- out_to 16 days in the future . The old one looked 10 days ahead . Besides hurrying or slowing planes , those winds help steer weather movements . Another forecasting technique is to run the models several times , with slightly different conditions at each start , to see how the results differ and how they are similar . It ' s a method that helps meteorologists decide which models are more accurate for a given situation . The old computer provided 14 model runs ; the new one will do 42 , said Anthony J . Mostek of the Weather Service . The more that results cluster together , the more likely the outcome , he said . National Weather Service Director Elbert W . Friday noted that the new computer is but one part of the agency ' s $ 4-billion modernization . The program also includes new satellites , measuring equipment , radars and other changes . &quot; I ' ve been in operational meteorology for 34 years and this is the most exciting time I can remember , &quot; Friday said .</TEXT>
