   <HEADLINE> OPEN-PRIMARY INITIATIVE PUT_ON ' 96 BALLOT ; POLITICS : MEASURE WOULD ALLOW DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR CANDIDATES OUTSIDE THEIR PARTIES . LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES CRITICIZE THE IDEA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An open-primary initiative designed to allow Democrats to help select Republican nominees and vice versa has qualified for the March , 1996 , ballot , but spokesmen for both major political_parties are criticizing the idea . A leading proponent , Sen . Tom Campbell ( R-Stanford ) , calls_for the open_primary as a political reform measure . He says it would give voters wider choices , increase voter_turnout and swing more votes to middle-of-the-road candidates who represent most Californians . Regarded_as a moderate Republican , Campbell is the kind of politician who might benefit from the open_primary by drawing votes from both major parties . Running only within his own party , Campbell narrowly lost the GOP nomination for U.S. senator in 1992 to conservative Bruce Herschensohn . Another supporter of the initiative , political consultant Ron Smith , who helped qualify it for the ballot , said , &quot; Many , many voters feel neither party represents them now , and they will be able to vote for the best person , regardless of party , under the open-primary system. &quot; Smith served as Campbell ' s U.S. Senate_campaign manager . Bob Mulholland , a campaign adviser for the state Democratic Party , replied , &quot; Primaries are for party members to vote for their own candidates . It ' s absurd to let non-members participate . I know the Lions Club doesn ' t let the Kiwanis Club vote_in their elections , or vice versa. &quot; State GOP Executive_Director John Peschong called the initiative a &quot; bad idea &quot; and questioned whether it would result in the best possible nominees . Under the initiative , all primary_election candidates would appear on a uniform ballot provided to all registered voters . They could vote for any candidate , regardless of party affiliation . The top vote-getters in each party represented on the ballot would appear on the November general_election ballot for a final_decision by the voters . California now uses a similar system in special elections to fill state legislative vacancies . Acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller said the open-primary initiative might not survive a court challenge if it is approved by the voters . &quot; The courts have held that political_parties have extensive control over how they conduct their business , &quot; Miller said , &quot; and it is unclear whether this measure would survive judicial scrutiny . &quot; Should this measure not be ruled invalid by the courts , the impact that this change could have_on the political process is immense , although difficult to measure at this point , &quot; he said . A Miller spokeswoman said she did not know how many other U.S. states conduct open_primaries . More_than 426 # 000 registered voters signed petitions to qualify the initiative for the ballot . Silicon_Valley industrialist and GOP campaign contributor David Packard supplied $ 202 # 000 to help collect the names . Campbell ' s own campaign committee furnished a $ 25 # 000 loan . California ' s 1996 primary_election will be held_in March instead of June because of a new state law that moved it up_to give the state more clout in picking presidential nominees .</TEXT>
