   <HEADLINE> LOCKYER DELAYS ACTION ON BUDGET DIRECTOR NOMINEE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer on Monday sidetracked the nomination of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s state budget director while a Senate committee investigates charges that false testimony was given on a proposed Mojave_Desert nuclear waste dump two years ago . The Democratic lawmaker ' s motion to send the pending confirmation of Russell Gould back to the Rules Committee , which had previously approved him , occurred without dissent amid renewed controversy over the safety of the Ward Valley site . While the committee conducts its election-year investigation , Gould will remain on_the_job as director of finance . Earlier , Gould had been in_charge of the state agency that licenses nuclear dump sites . A spokesman for Wilson said Gould , in his present job , has &quot; absolutely nothing to do with Ward Valley now or will he ever . We are confident ( the senators ) will come_to the conclusion that Russ Gould is the best person for the job. &quot; The Ward Valley issue was reignited last week when U.S. Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) charged that the state_Department of Health Services had deliberately suppressed information about the types and amounts of nuclear wastes that would be dumped there , including plutonium-239 from nuclear_power plants . State health officials have denied that they changed their estimates of the amount of plutonium intended for Ward Valley . They said a so-called worst-case scenario involving plutonium was merely a theoretical projection required by the federal_government in a license application . Monday ' s action was the second time the Senate delayed advancing Gould because of concerns that dumping nuclear waste at Ward Valley could contaminate the nearby Colorado_River . Gould was Wilson ' s nominee for secretary of health and welfare in 1992 , when controversy first erupted over the safety of the site . As secretary , Gould had administrative authority over the Department of Health Services , which is responsible_for nuclear safety licensing and enforcement in California . The confirmations of Gould and of Molly Coye , the governor ' s nominee to direct the Department of Health Services , were delayed until the Senate satisfied itself that safety issues would be properly addressed by the two officials . Coye left the Administration last year . Coye and Gould both testified as witnesses before the committee that the site posed no danger to Southern California , which draws some of its drinking_water from the Colorado_River . Gould later was promoted to state director of finance , the most powerful fiscal post in Wilson ' s Administration . He was unanimously recommended for confirmation by the Rules Committee last September , but a final vote by the Democratic-controlled Senate has been_on hold ever since . Lockyer said Boxer , an outspoken foe of the Ward Valley site , told him officials of the department &quot; intentionally misled the Legislature about the nature and extent of the radioactive materials that would be deposited at Ward Valley. &quot; &quot; It is a serious charge and ought to be resolved before we act_on Gould ' s confirmation , &quot; Lockyer told reporters . The Democratic senator said the investigation would look_into whether Gould , Coye and other state officials knew whether &quot; the waste stream description was different from that which they told us &quot; two years ago . He said it was uncertain when the committee would hold new hearings on Gould and when the investigation would conclude .</TEXT>
