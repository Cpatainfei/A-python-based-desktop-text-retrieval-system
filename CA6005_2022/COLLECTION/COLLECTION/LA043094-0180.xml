   <HEADLINE> FED STEPS IN TO BOLSTER DOLLAR ; STOCKS GAIN , BUT BONDS WEAKEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The battered dollar plunged toward its post-World War II low against the Japanese yen Friday before the federal_government unexpectedly intervened and carried the greenback to a small gain by the end of the day . But the dollar still fell against major European currencies . Meanwhile , stocks closed mostly higher , helped by the government ' s intervention in currency markets and Ford Motor Co. ' s strong quarterly earnings_report . However , concern about the dollar helped drive Treasury_bond yields_up , as some traders worried that a weak U.S. currency would lead to greater inflation . The Federal_Reserve_Bank of New York ' s decision to buy dollars , announced in a brief statement by Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , marks the first time since August that the government has intervened to prop_up the dollar against the yen . The dollar , which had been threatening to fall below 100 Japanese yen for the first time , closed_in New York at 101.50 yen Friday , up 0.15 yen for the day . It had fallen to 100.65 yen earlier in the day , just above a postwar low of 100.35 set_in August . A week ago , the greenback was at 103.26 yen , and it began the year at 111.85. The dollar had been pushed lower Thursday after the government reported slower-than-expected first-quarter economic_growth . A weak economy generally leads to a weaker currency , in part because slow growth usually means lower interest_rates , which make a nation ' s bonds less attractive to foreign investors . So far this year , however , short- and long-term U.S. interest_rates have been rising , not falling . Yet that has failed to bolster the dollar . Some analysts said the currency ' s weakness has been exacerbated by the selloff in_stock and bond markets this year , leading both foreign and domestic investors to question the value of the dollar . Indeed , the Treasury ' s decision to intervene Friday , via the Fed , was aimed in part at calming investors , analysts said . &quot; The Treasury wanted to show investors that it ' s still safe to invest in U.S. stocks and bonds , &quot; said Ezra Zask , head of Ezra Zask Associates , a hedge_fund in Norfolk , Conn . Other analysts said the decision to halt the dollar ' s decline signaled a change in the Clinton_Administration ' s trade_policy toward Japan . Since February , the Administration has allowed the dollar to decline versus the yen to make U.S. exports cheaper in Japan and Japanese exports more expensive here , an effort to force open Japan ' s markets and shrink its trade surplus with the United States . With the dollar poised to fall below 100 yen , however , the psychological impact on U.S. investors and on Japan may have been judged too extreme by the White_House , some experts said . &quot; If the Fed buys dollars for yen again , the market will get the message that the Administration isn ' t being as tough on Japan , &quot; said Earl Johnson , foreign_exchange adviser at Harris Trust &amp; Savings . In any case , the Fed ' s intervention failed to stop the dollar ' s fall against the German mark Friday . The greenback closed at 1.654 marks in New York , down from Thursday ' s 1.663. At the start of the year , a dollar bought 1.738 marks . &quot; The Fed broke the dollar ' s free fall , that ' s all , &quot; said David De Rosa , trader at Swiss Bank Corp . In Tokyo , the Nihon Keizai newspaper said today that the Bank_of_Japan will step_up efforts to boost the dollar against the yen . The bank will buy about $ 3 billion in the market a day , compared to $ 1 billion currently , the paper said . The U.S. stock_market , meanwhile , appeared to take_heart from the government ' s support for the dollar . The Dow Jones industrials added 13.38 points to 3 # 681.69 on Friday , and broader market indexes generally posted bigger gains . On the Big Board , winners topped losers by 13 to 9 . &quot; We have a market that is trying to stabilize , &quot; said Jonathan Dodd , analyst at Dean Witter . The Dow rose 33.01 points for the week . Stocks ' gains Friday were all_the more remarkable given another bad day in the bond market . The yield on the Treasury ' s benchmark 30-year bond , which had shot from 7.10 % to 7.26 % on Thursday , rose Friday to 7.30 % . The bond market had been spooked Thursday when the government reported that a key measure of inflation had risen in the first_quarter , even as the economy slowed . Rising inflation causes bond investors to demand higher yields to compensate . The weak dollar added fuel to the fire on Thursday and Friday , because a falling currency raises the risk of more inflation by boosting prices of_imported goods . Strength in gold , oil , lumber and other commodities also hurt bonds . The Commodity Research Bureau ' s price_index rose nearly 1 % on Friday . Among Friday ' s stock highlights : * Ford Motor ' s healthy earnings_report boosted its shares and helped sentiment toward other industrial shares . Ford gained 7 / 8 to 58 3 / 8 , Illinois Tool Works added 1 to 41 3 / 8 , ITT jumped 1 3 / 8 to 89 3 / 4 , Scott Paper surged 1 5 / 8 to 42 7 / 8 and machine_tool builder Acme Cleveland leaped 2 7 / 8 to 15 1 / 4 . * Transportation issues also jumped_on reports of a tentative settlement in the Teamsters strike and renewed interest in airlines . Consolidated Freightways rose 1 1 / 4 to 27 1 / 2 , Union Pacific gained 1 1 / 8 to 59 and Delta Air Lines soared 2 1 / 4 to 47 1 / 2 . * Other strong stock groups included electric utilities , retailers and golf-related issues . Overseas , London ' s FTSE-100 index ended the week at 3 # 125.3 , off 4.6 points . Frankfurt ' s DAX index eased 5.24 points to 2 # 245.98. Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index fell 27.13 points to 2 # 294.1. The Tokyo market was closed for a holiday .
