   <HEADLINE> LONG TRAIL OF A MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though Hansen ' s disease has existed since ancient times , it wasn ' t until the early part of this century that treatment other_than quarantine was discovered . Named for the Norwegian physician who pinpointed the bacteria in 1873 , Hansen ' s disease attacks body tissue slowly , and symptoms can take several years to appear . Left untreated , it can cause skin sores and discoloration , pain , blindness and accidental mutilation caused by loss of feeling in the limbs . It is still not completely understood by scientists . Despite its reputation as highly contagious , scientists now believe it can be transmitted only by repeated , long-term , human-to-human contact with a carrier . But evidence that Hansen ' s also can afflict armadillos may suggest unknown transmission routes , according to researchers . Treatment is still developing , said Dr. Thomas Rea , a dermatologist who heads the Hansen ' s disease clinic at Los Angeles County-USC Medical_Center . In the 1950s , the drug dapsone stopped the spread of the disease by halting the bacteria ' s ability to multiply . But it did not kill the bacteria that already existed , and scientists soon found patients who were resistant to dapsone . In the 1970s , multi-drug therapy was recommended by the World_Health_Organization . This worked so well that the organization declared a goal to cure Hansen ' s disease worldwide by 2000 . But Rea doubts the goal will be reached . Belgian scientist S.R. Pattyn released a study recently showing a 20 % relapse rate after 10 years of multi-drug therapy , Rea said . &quot; Even the most die-hard optimist would admit that ' s not acceptable , &quot; he said . More effective drugs were discovered in 1990 , but Rea said they are expensive and have not yet been proven safe . Though most cases are imported into the United States -- Rea said he has never seen a case originate_in California -- stopping the inflow has proven difficult . Patients are supposed to receive treatment before entering the United States , said Dr. John Trautman of the National Hansen ' s Disease Center , but the long incubation_period and lack of a simple detection method makes the disease hard to spot . Said Trautman : &quot; The best way to control it in the U.S. is to control it worldwide. &quot; GLEN JUSTICE</TEXT>
