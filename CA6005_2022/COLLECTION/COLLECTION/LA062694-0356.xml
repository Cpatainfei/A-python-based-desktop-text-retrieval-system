   <HEADLINE> RECORD BORROWING FOR BUDGET EXPECTED ; LEGISLATURE : DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE WANT TO ADOPT A PLAN THIS WEEK TO AVOID ANOTHER 1992-STYLE IMPASSE . UNIQUE POLITICAL DYNAMICS , DEFICIT COMPLICATE THIS YEAR ' S SITUATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the start of the next fiscal_year only days away , legislators and Gov . Pete Wilson will try this week to adopt an election-year budget that is almost certain to be propped_up by the biggest borrowing in the state ' s history . Still smarting from a public relations drubbing they took two years ago , when the state went 64 days without a budget and paid its bills with IOUs , the Republican governor and the Democrats who control the Legislature seem to want nothing more_than to get a budget -- any budget -- done on_time . Despite their partisan differences , Democratic and Republican budget negotiators have agreed on some basics : funding for public_schools , higher education and local_government . They are near an accord on how much to boost spending for the state ' s fast-growing prison system . Still in_dispute is how deeply to cut welfare grants -- a reduction of some kind is inevitable -- and the fate of two tax issues , one that affects the poor and one of concern to the state ' s wealthiest residents . No matter how these issues are resolved , the eventual budget is expected to rely_on a record $ 7 billion in borrowing over the next two years . The political dynamics at play in this year ' s negotiations are unique . With the Republican governor and 100 of the 120 seats in the Legislature on the ballot in November , the aim of most of those in the Capitol is to have a budget in place by Friday , the first day of the next fiscal_year . Yet the state ' s two top fiscal officers -- Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Controller Gray Davis -- are the Democratic nominees for governor and lieutenant_governor and have not been as willing as their colleagues in the Legislature to accept some of Wilson ' s assumptions . Wilson has proposed a two-year deficit financing plan that anticipates the receipt of $ 763 million this year and $ 2.8 billion next year from the federal_government for the cost of providing services to illegal immigrants . Few Democratic legislators believe these estimates are realistic . They are willing to go_along with Wilson because plugging those numbers into the budget spares them from having to raise taxes or make more painful spending_cuts . They can simply postpone the day_of_reckoning for another year . Brown , in contrast , wants to restructure the state ' s debt into a five-year note , which she would repay by cutting services and raising taxes . So far , her proposal has been all but ignored . Davis can block Wilson ' s proposed borrowing if he is not satisfied the state will have the cash on_hand in two years to repay the debt , and he has said Wilson ' s hope for a $ 2.8-billion bailout from the federal_government is unrealistic . As a result , he has demanded that legislators and the governor adopt a stand-by mechanism that would prompt budget_cuts or tax increases if the state ' s cash runs behind projections . Under the plan , the controller could declare a cash shortage at certain points between now and mid-1996 . If the controller did so , the governor would be required to propose a plan to fix the problem . If the Legislature failed to adopt the governor ' s plan or an alternative , across-the-board reductions would be triggered in every program not protected by the state Constitution or federal law . The Assembly has scheduled a vote on the budget_for Monday but the tally is expected to produce no more_than a partisan showdown , with Republicans voting against it . Assemblyman John Vasconcellos , the Democratic chairman of the budget-writing Ways and Means Committee , said the Republicans ' opposition to higher taxes is jeopardizing basic services on which Californians depend . &quot; If we don ' t begin to understand , the public and all_of us , how much the most precious institutions of education and health_care are at risk at this point_in_time , then we all ought to forsake any notion of California ever again being a decent place to live , work or study , &quot; Vasconcellos said . But a spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte said few of Vasconcellos ' fellow Democrats support higher taxes . He predicted that negotiations would continue even amid partisan posturing and that a final product that is acceptable to the required two-thirds of the members would be complete by week ' s end . &quot; Traditionally the Democrats have always proposed a budget that they would wish for but which the Republicans cannot support , &quot; said Phil Perry , Brulte ' s press secretary . &quot; But after these budgets go_down to defeat the negotiations continue and real progress can be made. &quot; So far , the negotiators have agreed to give elementary and secondary_schools enough money to keep_up with enrollment , though they will still lose ground to inflation . Community_colleges , meanwhile , would get an increase of about 4 % . The governor wants to boost fees from $ 13 per unit to $ 20 , but so far has met resistance in the Legislature . Higher education is in_line for modest increases . The University of California will get a 2 % increase , while the California State University system seems set to receive a 3.2 % boost . Both systems plan to increase student fees by 10 % . For local_government , lawmakers are set to approve Wilson ' s proposal to shift $ 500 million in property_tax revenues away from the counties . This is money the state tried to take a year ago . But because of a quirk in the law , the counties were able to avoid doing what the Legislature thought it had ordered . The state also appears ready to take $ 285 million away from county health programs -- another Wilson proposal . This cut is expected to force further reductions in_services to the poor . On prisons , Wilson proposed an increase of about 10 % to handle the rising population of inmates . Democrats had hoped to cut that growth in half but may give the governor what he wants because Brown , the Democratic nominee , has endorsed Wilson ' s figure . The situation on welfare is similar . Wilson wants to reduce grants 10 % immediately and another 15 % after six months for able-bodied adults still on the rolls . The combined reduction would leave a mother and two children with a monthly cash grant of $ 464 . They currently receive $ 607 each month . Democrats were insisting on no reduction in the grant , which has already dropped nearly $ 100 since Wilson took_office . But Brown , in her own budget proposal , called_for a 5 % cut , making_it more difficult for Democratic legislators to maintain their opposition . The other major dispute is over taxes . Republicans want to eliminate the $ 60 renters tax_credit , which has been suspended for two years but is scheduled to come_back on the books in 1995 . Democrats would like to preserve the credit , which goes mostly to low-income tenants . Democrats , meanwhile , want to maintain a temporary surcharge on personal_income taxes paid by the wealthy . The surcharge , enacted in 1991 and scheduled to expire at the end of 1995 , boosts the top rate from 9.3 % to 10 % or 11 % . The 10 % rate applies to incomes over about $ 100 # 000 , while the 11 % rate affects individuals earning more_than about $ 200 # 000 .</TEXT>
