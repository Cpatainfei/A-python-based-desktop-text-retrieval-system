   <HEADLINE> CROSS COLORS ; INTERRACIAL DATING IS NOT NEW , BUT HOW COUPLES GET TOGETHER HAS CHANGED . FROM 900-NUMBERS TO SPECIALTY MAGAZINES , THERE ARE ASSORTED AVENUES TO WANDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looking_for love ? Or , at the very least looking ? Well , if of late you ' ve strolled , well-worn china marker in_hand , through the jumble of newsprint personals , you just might have noticed an emerging theme : &quot; A Pelican Brief : Seeking Julia Roberts / Denzel Washington chemistry . Successful professional SBM , 28 , ISO attractive SWF for adventure romance , friendship &amp; positive relationship. &quot; Or the local female who quite specifically outlines the object of her desires : &quot; Let ' s start a romantic revolution ! Intell. , tall , blnde , 43 sks So . Amer. , Carib. , or Ethiopian prof . 30-40. &quot; Some of these passion_plays are downright outrageous , pointed and purposely testing all limits ; others are romantic anachronisms -- carefully plotted , lush , production-designed daydreams waiting to spring to life . What all share , however , is the desire for companionship , with a twist -- crossing often historically indelible lines of race , ethnicity and culture . In Los Angeles -- celebrated Ellis Island West and noted trend and style capital -- many taste-making factors come_into play . From proximity and bare-bones curiosity to simply the fallout of big city living , singles who feel isolated , marginalized or simply lonely confront days that are top-heavy with work , not play . Add growing sociological and psychological concerns -- such_as the common kaffeeklatsch complaint about the shortage &quot; of good ( fill_in the blank with any hue ) men. &quot; And communication breakdowns that keep men and women from embarking_on , let alone completing , even the simplest dialogue . Although interracial coupling is certainly nothing new , how people are meeting is definitely changing . From personal ads and highly specialized dating services to cross-cultural mixers , 900-numbers , special-interest support groups and magazines , those interested in dating outside their race have a plethora of avenues to wander . * To call this a complex issue would be like saying Los Angeles has had a &quot; spot of trouble &quot; the last couple years . Words don ' t adequately capture the candor and volatile potential of even broaching the subject of interracial dating -- not to mention the public display . Forget that the &quot; Thin White Duke &quot; himself , David Bowie , and Somalia-born model Iman provide a highly photogenic paparazzi moment , that Connie Chung and Maury Povich can publicly trade a fond smile and kiss , or that it ' s easy to discern the hottest black super-model by keeping close tabs on who is_on Robert DeNiro ' s arm . As open as_many believe the &quot; crossing &quot; climate is , opposition still awaits those who go_against this rigid yet often unspoken social norm . Yet , the trend is growing . Although data is often difficult to come_by , and not always complete or easily interpreted , Dan Hollis , co-editor of New People magazine , says that the U.S. Census shows a &quot; fourfold increase &quot; just in black-white interracial marriages from 1970 to 1990 -- to more_than 200 # 000 in the latter year . Perhaps part of this increase , some say , can be attributed to media broadening the purview . Dr. Lawrence Tenzer , author of &quot; A Completely New Look_at Interracial Sexuality : Public_Opinion and Select Commentaries , &quot; cites a 1991 Gallup Poll , which found that 64 % of people 18-29 approve of marriages between blacks_and_whites , while only 27 % of those older than 50 concur . &quot; that ' s pretty astounding if you think_about it , &quot; he says . &quot; But young people today are growing with TV , seeing blacks as professionals as opposed to what their parents saw -- mammies , servants . In my opinion , media set the standards . And it is the sole factor affecting change right now. &quot; Toni Burrell agrees that media have had tremendous influence on altering mood and softening the stigma . In her two years as a personals ad representative at L.A Weekly , she ' s noticed a marked increase in singles open_to searching for mates outside their racial or ethnic_groups . &quot; I think people are becoming less selective about physical attributes when they are looking_for someone to date , &quot; she says . &quot; And if you look_at the media , they show interracial couples in everything from Levi ' s ads to music videos , so it is not a novelty or taboo anymore. &quot; Burrell also notes that it isn ' t so_much about quenching the thirst of a fantasy as some people might think . Singles she serves , mainly between ages 25-40 , &quot; are people who are looking_for serious relationships and are not satisfied by the quality of people that they are meeting , so they are expanding their horizons . . . . that ' s why they say ' race unimportant ' . . . because they realize that there are a lot of quality people that they may_not meet if they are closed. &quot; Burrell , who is African American , met her fiance , Randall Schlesinger , who is white and Jewish , through an ad she placed in the paper ' s personals three years ago . She suggests , however , answering ads -- any ad -- with caution . And with those of the cross-cultural variety , she says , there are other signs to look_out for , signals to explore : &quot; You can kind of tell by the way they ' re written . . . . They build them up as a fantasy thing , like ' Vanilla looking_for chocolate fantasy ' or ' Vanilla looking_for chocolate topping ' . . . rather than someone being open_to dating a lot of people . So I say ask questions , ask a lot of questions. &quot; * Just a_few hours after sunrise , Kymberly Jean takes long , brisk strides down Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice . The president of Opposites Attract , an interracial introduction service she launched four years ago , Jean apologizes for her casual attire . That includes full makeup , pressed black jeans , boots , newsboy cap turned backward , and baggy flak-jacket festooned with swatches of African cloth , shells and buttons made to look_like coins . An alarm-red sports_car screams out of an alley , interrupting her stroll . It misses Jean by inches , and the driver , flustered and arms flailing , mouths a dramatic apology . She turns_to absolve him with a short nod . Pausing , she turns again , time enough to take_in the rugged face and tousled sandy-brown hair . Two more steps and she stops again , turns and flashes a brilliant smile . Kymberly Jean -- matchmaker for the ' 90s -- logs_in little downtime . From a mere $ 500 to a cool $ 5 # 000 ( &quot; depending_on the difficulty of the match &quot; ) , Jean hopes to quite possibly send you on your . . . er . . . married way . This whole caldron of a career began , she explains , with a nocturnal image : &quot; I was sleeping and I was awakened about 3 or 4 in the morning with this clear vision . Like somebody just whispered in my ear. &quot; For the most part , her service works like others : &quot; I ask you some questions . . . . ' Tell me a little bit about you ? . . . What do you have to offer a person ? ' Then I give a homework assignment . . . ' cause 80 % of the time people don ' t know what they are looking_for . They say : ' Just somebody nice. ' And I say . . . ' Let ' s get a little specific here. ' &quot; Jean digs for cogent details about the client ' s background : &quot; How you got_into dating interracially ? Why is that a preference , or is that a fad ? Will you date someone of your same race ? &quot; Quickly , she develops a profile . And those who inadvertently communicate dubious intentions , who have their heart set_on capturing a fantasy based on racial-ethnic stereotypes ? &quot; I send them on their way , &quot; she says . Jean says she can ferret those out pretty quickly , as well as singles who are simply trying to slip out of a bad dating cycle as if it were a blouse , hoping a different shade may change their luck . &quot; Sometimes they ' ll say , ' Well I ' ve never done_it , but I ' m curious ' cause I hear white guys are really nice . . . they ' re really generous. ' Well , &quot; says Jean , her smoky voice turning steely , &quot; they ' re not all nice and they ' re not all generous and this is not a toy . Or a game. &quot; Some people , she has observed , are naive about what crossing racial borders entails . When differences within their relationships crop_up or tension brews from outside , Jean says , the couples are often ill-prepared to handle the sometimes blusterous attention : &quot; People think it ' s a bed of roses , but it ' s not . I mean when I started dating interracially , people would walk up_to us all_the time and throw bottles . . . shout things . It ' s not the piece_of_cake that people think it is . Now it ' s a little better , especially here in L.A. &quot; Reasons for crossing vary almost as widely as the choices available to singles in a city that has become a veritable cultural smorgasbord . And Jean hopes to explore some of those reasons in &quot; The Meeting Room , &quot; her half-hour show on Century Cable . &quot; Personalities , the differences , ethics , economics , education , &quot; she notes . &quot; I cannot hide the fact that with some people it is sexual . Some people do_it for business . Like some guys will marry a certain race of woman because it will make him look better in the law firm. &quot; Making matches that reduce a person to an object or symbol creates a whole set of tangled issues to consider . &quot; I have a problem with doing_it for the wrong reason -- period , &quot; she says . &quot; And if the reasons aren ' t good_enough , I have every right to refuse people. &quot; Still , Jean admits , &quot; It happens all_the time. &quot; * Sam , who met his wife , Sharon , through Opposites Attract , wasn ' t experimenting . &quot; It wasn ' t something new , &quot; he says . &quot; I had my first interracial relationship with a black_woman in 1986. &quot; Although Sam , 32 and of Italian descent , says he didn ' t date black_women exclusively , the attraction eventually emerged as preference ; the appeal , he notes , is a sense of inner strength . &quot; I was always raised that color never really meant anything , that it was the person on the inside , not the color on the outside , &quot; he adds . Sharon , 44 , says she decided to look_into the service after seeing Jean on &quot; Oprah. &quot; What gave her pause , however , was the stigma that surrounds that brand of matchmaking in_general . ( And because of that , neither Sharon nor her husband will allow their last_names to be used. ) &quot; You don ' t realize the social supermarket when you are in school , &quot; she says . &quot; You just think that life is like that . That new people will come along. &quot; Sharon says she chose Opposites Attract because &quot; ( Interracial dating ) was what I was used to . . . . Where I grew_up , we were the only black family in town . . . . I hadn ' t been exposed to many black_men through my work , where I lived . . . and I thought this might be a way to meet people who are open-minded. &quot; Matchmaker Jean , who has dated interracially for more_than 10 years , has come under_fire -- from the raging talk-show three-ring to threatening calls and letters -- for providing an outlet for people who prefer to date out of their race or ethnicity . &quot; People accuse me of committing genocide , &quot; she says . &quot; When I started this , it was not my intention to hurt anybody , to create any problem. &quot; In this supply-and-demand culture , and as an ambitious entrepreneur , she simply recognized a need , Jean explains : &quot; Now it ' s ' in ' to be interracial . . . . More women . . . are saying I need a mate . Regardless of color. &quot; * Michael James , national sales manager for a firm that provides voice-mail service for about 400 publications nationwide and in Canada , believes that the voice-personal phenomenon provides a safe_harbor in this tenuous territory that a face-to-face meeting cannot . &quot; It ' s doing a little something to break_down an image of a person ( one ) likes to date . . . . Maybe that ' s one of the reasons why there is more interracial dating going_on with voice mail services . . . . By hearing someone , you don ' t picture this person as being Asian , Hispanic , black or white . . . you have to listen to what they are all about. &quot; With dating services , says Dr. Jonathan Brower , a Westlake Village psychotherapist , &quot; there are the same pros and cons . . . as there are when people meet in_general . On the surface it saves a lot of time , it seems as if there is less hit or miss . &quot; But the problem is that people have , no pun intended , these great expectations that the dating services will lead them to their true love . And when they don ' t , they feel betrayed and angry. &quot; Whether you ' re looking specifically for a cross-cultural connection or not , Brower suggests , the approach is not as mysterious as one might think . He believes_in a more conventional route : &quot; Do things they enjoy . And there they will come_across someone who they have something in common with , get_to know one another , spend time together -- and see what happens. &quot; But heady with the thrill of finding a soul_mate , some couples often are astonished and emotionally ill-equipped when problems roll into view . &quot; People have a very idealized notion of what love can and cannot do , &quot; Brower says . &quot; They look_at it as magic . That can ' t be sustained . There are people who are attracted to other racial groups and ethnicities because they need to be rebellious . . . . That is not a good foundation for a relationship . But it doesn ' t mean that a couple can ' t work_through that. &quot; Deborah Cook , an L.A. marriage and family therapist , warns that some people are trying to multiculturize without looking_at historical factors : &quot; There are a whole set of_values that accompany this thing called race and color. &quot; Although sometimes emotionally strenuous and often thankless work , the efforts that interracial couples make to dismantle the walls by the simple act of living their lives , Cook says , are invaluable for the future . &quot; There is an exciting piece to it , &quot; she says . &quot; These folks are_on the cutting edge . . . they are the first drop of water in a stream . Whether we like it or not , people are mixing and they are paving the way for other people to. &quot; * Magazines such_as Atlanta-based Interrace and New People , in Detroit , want to increase that dialogue . Candy Mills , 29 , launched Interrace in 1989 , with very little support . &quot; Not even my husband ' s , &quot; she says with a laugh . What prompted her to put her money and energies into such a herculean project was her frustrating search for resources , advice and direction . As a young wife in an interracial union and the mother of a biracial child , Mills says there was really nowhere to look_for answers to her specialized needs . &quot; And when the mainstream did , it was something that exploited rather than edified . Spiced_up in_order to sell papers or get ratings , &quot; she says . &quot; There was no balance . I don ' t have a problem with examining or reporting on dysfunctional interracial families or children . They do exist out there , but there was nothing about those that were functioning quite normally. &quot; Now published eight times yearly and with a circulation of 25 # 000 , Mills and her husband , Gabriel Grosz , 43 , want to promote cultural understanding , not necessarily sanction interracial unions . &quot; I hope Interrace examines the fears of those in interracial relationships . . . as well as those who point fingers and judge from the outside , &quot; she says . &quot; I think there is more of a tolerance , but there is no such thing as acceptance when it comes_to interracial couples . If that were to happen , we ' d have no racism. &quot; Yvette Walker-Hollis , 32 , and her husband , Dan Hollis , 35 , hope to do their part to dismantle some of those fears come August . New People , their 4-year-old , 2 # 500 circulation magazine , will host a convention in Dallas under the banner , &quot; No More Fear , &quot; with workshops addressing the range of topics surrounding interracial marriages and relationships . Hollis says they plan to send a strong and resonant message : &quot; Anybody black or white or whatever . . . who has a problem , might as well accept us , because you ' re not stopping us. &quot; The couple started the magazine fueled by Mills ' same sense of isolation . &quot; We became a clearinghouse and support mechanism , &quot; Walker-Hollis says , &quot; for people who don ' t have friends to turn to. &quot; Both magazines traverse the same universe , publishing advice columns for newlyweds and young parents of biracial children , and discussions about transracial adoptions . They also serve as rotating bulletin_boards of sorts for support and advocacy groups , as well as providing personal listings and advertisements for dating services . Although both couples have seen growing interest in interracial relationships through correspondence to the magazines , both Mills and Grosz say many dating services find it difficult to survive . &quot; They are often run_by people who don ' t have training in management , &quot; Mills says . Be careful , she warns , suggesting that before you join any dating service , try to get verifiable written references . &quot; Everyone starts_out with good intentions , and it ' s a great idea , &quot; Grosz says . &quot; There is a population out there who wants an interracial connection . . . and I think that there is a need for these dating services . We get more and more ( personal ) ads from people who are afraid to approach someone of a different race or culture. &quot; Grosz would like to further expand such opportunities and , with today ' s climate , he ' s thinks the possibilities could be limitless : &quot; If someone were to start an interracial night club , where people are not afraid to approach people and aren ' t worried about being turned_down on the basis of race , they would really be_on to something. &quot; Dating Rules When Race Is Unimportant The following is excerpted from &quot; Interracial Dating Turn-offs , &quot; by Sandy Cirillo , Interrace magazine , January / February , 1993 : 1 . Racial slurs : If you think words such_as China Doll or Chief are harmless , cute or funny , you should think_twice about crossing the color_line . The use or slip of just one racial slur has the power of altering an interracial relationship forever and can often lead to its termination . 2 . Imitating / impersonating a different race : There are many people who purposely and very obviously attempt to sound like , walk like , dress like a particular group of people unlike themselves in_order to fit_in . If you are not black , you don ' t have to &quot; act black &quot; to date a black_man or woman . Likewise , if you are not white , you don ' t have to &quot; act white &quot; to date a white_man or woman . Be yourself ! 3 . Assuming stereotypes are true for all : It is unwise to get_into an interracial relationship based primarily or solely on stereotypes , whether they be positive or negative . We date individuals , not a race of people . Thus every person should be appreciated and treated on an individual basis , especially when it comes_to dating interracially . 4 . Secret relationships : Don ' t get involved in an interracial relationship if you are planning on hiding or denying to friends and family that you are in one . It is demeaning and unfair to everyone , including yourself . 5 . Shock effect : Crossing the color_line is not a game . If you think the attention , the stares and comments , and the novelty of crossing the color_line will make no difference to you and thus jump into an interracial relationship without regard_to what interracial dating entails , you need to brace yourself for a hard landing . 6 . To have fair-skinned children : As sad and bizarre as this may sound , not only is this a painfully honest reason why some people become interracially involved , but it also seems to be more acceptable than interracial couples are . 7 . Wild erotic sex : The color of a person ' s skin has nothing to do with how &quot; sweet &quot; he or she is in bed . 8 . Status symbol : How emotionally and psychologically damaging it has to be to your partner ' s self-esteem to know that the only reason he or she was chosen was because their skin was darker or lighter . We are much more_than color . Don ' t short change yourself into thinking that any human_being can be used as a status symbol for long . Don ' t give_away your identity to a person of a different race . Only you can make yourself acceptable to others . 9 . Self-hatred : If you think an interracial relationship can fill your emptiness , it will only serve to make things worse for you . First you must confront why you hate yourself , why you look down on_your_own people . Then step back . Now you must fix yourself by yourself ( as opposed to being in a relationship ) . Only then do you have a chance in building a healthy , happy interracial relationship . 10 . Being afraid to commit : It is imperative that you don ' t commit to an interracial relationship that you may_not be able to handle . Only you know how much outside pressure you can take . Discuss this with your partner so he or she isn ' t left holding your baggage .</TEXT>
