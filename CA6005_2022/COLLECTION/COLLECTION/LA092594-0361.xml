   <TEXT> I chase history . I ' ve been running after it for 30 years , half my life . I ' ve chased it into rare-book shops , manuscript dealerships , antique stores , estate sales , rummage_sales . Chased it across the ocean to Europe . Chased down more_than 6 # 000 books , paintings , films , toys , pamphlets , letters and slave documents , all_of it to tell the story of 300 years of the African-American experience . It torments me and terrifies me and leaves me trembling with joy . It also makes me wonder : Why me ? Why is a man who spent much of his life as a disc_jockey , screaming his heart out during the golden_age of rhythm and blues music -- a man whose most famous words are &quot; Burn , Baby , Burn ! &quot; -- why does a man like me become ordained to preach history ? Why do I feel as compelled to explain the majesty of the Black Eagle ( stay tuned ) as_to rhapsodize about Sam Cooke ? Why am I chasing history when , for so_long , history was chasing me ? The name is Montague . One word : MONT-a-gyew . When I was_on the radio , when I was spreading the music of James Brown , Otis Redding , the Temptations , Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett , when I was turning an R &amp; B music show into a sweet soul church_service , commanding my listeners to put their hands on the radio and touch my heart , listeners from L.A. to Chicago to New York knew me as Magnificent Montague . Even today , a quarter-century later , it ' s not uncommon for them to recognize me . They ' ll hear my voice , or maybe spot my name on a piece of mail , and suddenly I ' ll be hearing their reminiscences about being 16 and listening to my show on a school_bus . And , inevitably , the question will be asked : Why aren ' t you back on the radio , Montague ? Lord knows they need you to bring some fire to the air . And I ' ll shake my head and smile . For my time on the radio was indeed a time of fire . It was a time when music and society and race and technology all exploded like a bomb , a time when black DJs made R &amp; B erupt out of that old marketing niche of &quot; race music &quot; and changed the way young Americans -- white as well as black -- saw their world . To live_in that vortex was to touch America ' s soul and be touched by it . MY YEARS WERE 1952 TO 1971 , AND THE HOTTEST YEAR of all was 1965 , the year Watts burned . I had arrived_at KGFJ , a black-oriented AM station on Melrose Avenue , early that year , bringing with me a slogan I ' d developed on the air in New York at WWRL -- a harsh cry of delight I often shouted during a record I particularly enjoyed : &quot; Burn , baby , burn ! &quot; My fans would call_in on the radio every morning before they went_to high_school and yell it back at me -- same way Rush Limbaugh ' s crowd calls_up these days to say &quot; Ditto , &quot; only with soul . Just a way of signifying that rare , glorious , sanctified moment in which a record , or anything else , had taken its art to a new level . Out on the playground , a young_man might make a twisting , Elgin Baylor , hang-in-the-air shot , and you ' d hear it from the brothers on the sidelines : &quot; Burn , baby ! &quot; It infected the lexicon like a virus , and to my horror , when Watts went_up in flames that August , when people began setting buildings and cars afire on Imperial Highway and Avalon Boulevard and Main_Street , they triumphantly screamed the most evident and analogous and hip thing at_hand : &quot; Burn , baby ! &quot; Back then , as the city reeled , I didn ' t know what to say in response . For the first two days of the riots I kept using &quot; Burn , Baby , Burn ! &quot; on the air , like I always did . It was my slogan , not the rioters ' . And the people in power who were demanding that I stop saying it -- people like the mayor , Sam Yorty , and the police_chief , William Parker -- had no right to take it away from me . Only as the years went_by and my hobby of collecting turned_into an obsession with black history did_it dawn on me that the right rhetorical response to &quot; Burn ! &quot; would have been a tired but true cliche : &quot; Learn , baby. &quot; Learn about the forces that are controlling you . Learn to dominate them . Learn that your people in America have always struggled against oppression and always will . Learn , in ways that will astonish and inspire you , that they have often won despite odds much greater than those you face . Learn , for example , about the Black Eagle . Come_along with me on the chase for him . Feel my adrenaline pump and my goose bumps rise . From time to time there ' s a manuscript dealer I telephone . Last time must have been five years ago . &quot; Anything for me ? &quot; I ask . She says , &quot; No , nothing. &quot; One morning a_few months ago , I ' m doing my daily exercise workout near my apartment in Mid-Wilshire -- and I see her on the street with another lady . I call_out , in mock defeat , &quot; I ' m not gonna get anything from you , am I ? &quot; And she answers , &quot; I think I have something for you , but I ' m not sure where it is. &quot; Her files are like that . &quot; What is it ? &quot; I ask . &quot; The Black Eagle. &quot; Well , my heart about stopped . I had been fascinated with the Black Eagle since I first read about him in the ' 60s . His name was Hubert Fauntleroy Julian , and you can pick your description of him : soldier_of_fortune , stunt_pilot , diplomat , rum runner , bodyguard , foreign correspondent , mercenary . The crown_prince of black aviation . He was born in Trinidad in 1897 , was raised in America and ran_into the wall of segregation when he tried to become a military pilot in the 1930s . Blacks did not fly for this nation until the 332nd Fighter Group -- the Tuskegee Airmen -- was formed in 1942 , a year after Pearl_Harbor . So in 1936 , Julian volunteered to fly for Haile Selassie ' s Ethiopian forces , which were under_attack by Italy . He became a colonel . The Black Eagle was a spectacular man . Six feet tall , 200 pounds , striding through life in a derby , cutaway coat , striped trousers and spats . I had never been able to obtain a shard of the man ' s life . But now my friend , the dealer , was offering me a piece . It was a letter that showed me yet another side of the Black Eagle . Dated Sept . 6 , 1940 , and written_on stationery identifying Julian as a captain in the Finnish Air_Force , it described how Finland , which had been attacked by Germany five months earlier , had asked Julian to broker the purchase of 10 air ambulances . Julian had arranged for a Delaware aircraft company to build the planes and for Finnish pilots to fly them back to their homeland . The Black Eagle would pocket 10 % of the $ 529 # 000 cost . I had known none of this . Now I did . I had never been able to touch the Black Eagle . Now I could . And so I slipped him into an acid-free folder and put him to sleep_with the rest of the people whose glory and foibles I pursue , the people who one day will come_alive inside what I will call the Montague Museum of African-American History and Culture . This is the vision that drives me , that keeps me cataloguing and indexing . I am one day going_to build this museum for the ages , particularly for the youngsters , this show-me generation that needs history to live and breathe , that needs to hold men and women like the Black Eagle in its hands . I started collecting in the 1950s , rummaging through used-book stores at first , then became obsessed in the ' 60s . Never expected to get interested in black history because I didn ' t grow_up thinking_of myself as black . Oh , I was black , but not black-black . I didn ' t feel black . I felt_like Montague . THE RADIO BUSINESS CHANGED THAT . Growing_up in New York in the ' 40s I was a radio junkie . I loved the voices I heard , the great radio voices of people like Gabriel Heatter , the newsman , and Martin Block , the pioneer disc_jockey . I got the bug . I had no style , but I knew what styles to steal and meld , and at 16 I just picked_up , headed north and managed to sell enough advertising time on a little low-frequency station in the Boston suburb of Brookline , to get a half-hour show . That job folded after a_few months , and I hitched a ride with a music promoter down to Texas . that ' s where I found_out I was black . Houston , KCOH , 1953 . Texas City , KTLW , 1954 . &quot; You got sponsors , boy ? OK , you can have air time to play records , but please don ' t come_into the station . You do your shows from nightclubs or restaurants , got_it ? Stay out of the building. &quot; It was a bitch . And what made_it even harder was the fact that I started to develop a style of broadcasting aimed at women . Looking_back , this was a no-brainer . You couldn ' t get_on the air if you didn ' t find sponsors for your 15- or 30-minute show , and women held the purse_strings But I pushed the envelope until it popped . I started to draw a surprising number of white female listeners . Here I am , confident as all hell , reading my poetry on the air , dedicating it to my &quot; darlings , &quot; telling them not to let their men treat them like dogs , vilifying the male species . Didn ' t have to be a genius to figure_out who that was going_to upset . One day some men in white sheets visit the station . The manager calls me inside and introduces me to the representatives of the Ku Klux Klan . &quot; By God , you been makin ' love to white ladies , boy , &quot; one klansman complains . Boy this , boy that . Uppity , uppity . Manager jumps in to save his own scalp -- &quot; Montague , didn ' t I tell you to stop that ? &quot; I ' m dead , I know it , when in walks J . P . Richardson , later to be known as the Big Bopper , the singer who died with Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens in the historic 1959 plane crash . He stood_up to the klan and the station manager and saved my job . . . and , for all I know , my skin . These kinds of raw encounters scraped away my naivete . Later on down the road , fans would hear me scream with glee over Ray Charles ' &quot; Drown in My Own Tears , &quot; Stevie Wonder ' s &quot; Uptight , &quot; James Brown ' s &quot; Lost Someone , &quot; the Miracles ' &quot; Shop Around &quot; and Otis Redding ' s &quot; Mister Pitiful &quot; and assume I was a soul brother off the block , blown onto the air from the corner of some mythical ghetto intersection . &quot; Back it up and gimme four more bars ! &quot; I ' d yell at the end of a record I wanted to promote , and then I ' d play the last 30 seconds again and moan over it lovingly . Truth be told , I didn ' t know squat about R &amp; B or the blues until I went_down to Texas . I started learning on Sundays , when I ' d fill_in once in a while on &quot; The Little Green Church on the_Hill , &quot; a show for shut-ins . Bible reading and preaching . New to me , brother . My people in New York weren ' t fire_and_brimstone ; I was raised Holiness , Pentacostal , but none of it hit me , you understand ? This thing about &quot; blacks all got soul , &quot; that ' s a lie . I didn ' t have no soul . But there was a black preacher whom I shared time on the air with , and I started picking_up on how black preachers operate . I started to mock him : &quot; And the L-o-o-o-r-d said . . . . &quot; that ' s how I developed . I got my radio personality from a lot of unknown black preachers and artists of the South . Those fierce blues singers in Chicago . Those resolute Black Muslims of Harlem . Influences . I ' m part and parcel of all_of them . I want to be honest . Without them , there ' d be no Magnificent Montague . Those preachers , they had the timing . I mean , I didn ' t know how to dance , man . And some of that blues music , I didn ' t understand what they were shouting about . What allowed me to develop my persona as a young_man was that all kinds of black music filtered through Texas : Bobby Bland , Howlin ' Wolf , Muddy Waters , Louis Jordan , gospel stars like the Soul Stirrers and their new star , Sam Cooke , doo-wop . Meeting them , doing my daily show from clubs , record_hops , living and breathing with the listeners , the fans , the advertisers -- something inside me started to bubble_up . I fled Texas for Chicago by 1955 . Had to . Southern segregation was too stifling . A prominent black DJ in Chicago on WAAF died , and I beat_out 150 other jockeys for his job . I became , unknowingly , part of a huge migration of Southern blacks to northern cities , the same way I ' d become , in the mid-1960s , part of another huge migration of blacks to Los Angeles . When I was_on the air in Chicago , listeners who ' d moved there from Texas would sometimes telephone their families and hold the receiver next to the radio , sending a nostalgic blast of Montague down South . I understood none of the historical significance of these demographic shifts . I was too busy hustling , working the edges , trying to convert a $ 50-a-week radio salary into a living wage , cutting deals with sponsors and record stores and record companies and record promoters and advertisers . Example : You get 100 extra promotional copies from a record company and give them to a liquor_store owner ; then he gives the beer brand that sponsors your show better shelf position . Over the years , I stuck my fingers into every crevice of the music business . I became a songwriter , a publisher of more_than 150 singles and albums and a record producer . I built my own studios wherever I was a DJ and used them to record new talent . Managed artists , booked weekend shows . What else was I going_to do , protest my lousy radio pay ? There wasn ' t anybody to protest to . Working in these racially charged environments , driving through so many cities in an era in which highways still let you see local commerce , and being the kind of person who likes to soak_up a variety of influences , I spent more and more time looking_for materials defining black history . There wasn ' t a lot of competition for memorabilia . Negroes were still relatively invisible in America . As any collector can tell you , you develop an addictive love of pursuit . You see a fragment and it fits because of a dozen other seemingly isolated fragments that you ' ve bought over the years . You imagine or crave a certain work , and then one day , out of nowhere , you behold it . Better yet , you are occasionally confronted with material that transcends your imagination . I was in a rare-book shop in New York once , leafing through the Civil War section . Man at the counter says , &quot; Look , I don ' t have nothing. &quot; I keep browsing , and I see the spine of a thin book , the title so old I can ' t make_it out . Now , I have a rule : Whenever I can ' t understand the printing on the spine , I always look . I open it up . It ' s in mint condition . The title is jarring : &quot; Our Nig. &quot; I notice the date , 1859 . I notice the subtitle : &quot; Sketches From the Life of a Free Black. &quot; that ' s enough for me . Without reading further , I buy_it and put it away for 15 years . Only when I read an article saying that Harvard had a copy of the first novel ever written by a black_woman , and that someone there was bragging about it , did I check my file , and I smiled : It was the same book , written by Harriet E . Wilson , whose name was buried in small type on an inside page . But see what happens when you ' re consumed by collecting ? Sometimes your instincts jump too quickly for your own good . I had assumed that I ' d bought a white writer ' s biography of a black . Only now did I recognize that I ' d purchased something far more valuable . Some of what I own , I have never seen another copy of . An example is my thick 1895 book recording all written and spoken tributes after the sudden_death of Frederick Douglass , America ' s leading Abolitionist -- and that scares me more_than it delights . If I hadn ' t found that book , it might well be consigned to oblivion . Imagine : What happens if &quot; Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil &amp; Wicked Traffic of the Slavery &amp; Commerce of the Human Species , &quot; written in 1787 by Attobah Cugoano , an African taken_to England , is never read ? What happens if a tiny , elegant pincushion with an engraving of a black_man in chains , called &quot; A Colored Man in the City of New York , &quot; made in 1835 by Patrick Henry Reason , a black artist who worked for Abolitionists , is never seen ? What happens if Frank Sapp ' s magnificent 1944 painting of Haitian Gen . Toussaint L ' Ouverture astride a horse , symbolizing the ability of black_men and women to throw_off colonial chains , is never viewed ? Conversely , what happens if you allow people to experience these works , and hundreds like them , in the course of a day ? I ' ll tell you . You throw your so-called contemporary role_models in the trash_can . You proclaim that these are our role_models . The more I collected , and the longer I remained a DJ , the more my professional_life bled into my fascination with the black experience . I was working_at KSAN in San Francisco in 1957 when the station decided to jump into the violent struggle to integrate Central High_School in Little_Rock , Ark . A delegation of us , including the station ' s white owner , the Rev . Norwood Patterson , flew to Providence , R.I. , where Arkansas Gov . Orval Faubus was attending a weekend governors conference , along with President Eisenhower . The week before , Faubus had barred nine black children from entering Central High . I squeezed into a Saturday press_conference the governor was holding and burst_out on behalf of one of the black children , Elizabeth Eckford , whom we planned to fly out_to San Francisco Sunday for a rally . &quot; Governor ! &quot; I yelled . &quot; That little_girl says she ' s scared but she wants to go_back to school . Why don ' t you give the kids a chance to learn , let them go_back to school Monday , and if there ' s any trouble , then call_out the National_Guard to protect them ? &quot; &quot; Why do you try to crucify me ? &quot; Faubus replied . &quot; I ' m the most liberal governor in the South. &quot; &quot; Do you call pointing guns at children ' liberal ? ' &quot; I shouted back . Now , what the hell was I doing ? I didn ' t have the political sophistication to be carrying_on a debate with a minor-league politician , let alone Faubus . But at a time when blacks had no power base beyond their churches , this was the role that black DJs had begun to play in the ' 50s . Whites owned the stations and the unions . We DJs labored in electronic sweat shops , sweltering studios with noisy electric_fans , one microphone and two turntables and heavy headphones . Your on-air nickname might be Jockey Jack , but if you messed_up they ' d fire you and put another Jockey Jack on the air tomorrow , and it would be as though you never existed . Barely up from slavery . Yet despite these hardships -- in fact , because of them -- successful black DJs enjoyed astonishingly strong , direct communication with a mass audience , a feeling of solidarity that was unprecedented in commercial broadcasting . We were de_facto mayors and weekday preachers , masters of a private universe . We were the equivalent of movie_stars , the sole link between listeners and the music . No way that happens today . You ' ve got stations being routinely sold for tens of millions of dollars , programming their music on the basis of demographic and &quot; psychographic &quot; studies . The DJs are along for the ride . In my day , radio was a seat-of-the-pants business . You worked by your gut . Tell you a story from 1961 . I ' ve left San Francisco for a brief stop in L.A. and then a year in St . Louis , and now I ' ve hit New York , home at last , on WWRL . I ' m so popular that in addition to my 1 to 3 p.m. show , the station adds another three-hour shift , midnight to 3 a.m. ( Thousands of parents eventually wrote the station to complain that their kids ' schoolwork was suffering because they were staying_up too late. ) Atlantic Records , the giant of R &amp; B , has purchased a song called &quot; If You Need Me , &quot; intending to have it recorded by one of its popular artists , the great Solomon Burke . But somebody has slipped me a copy of an unreleased &quot; demo &quot; of the song , recorded by a then-unknown artist named Wilson Pickett . I love it and begin playing it , and the request phone_line starts jumping_off the hook with calls from listeners who feel the same way . I call_up Jerry Wexler , Atlantic ' s guru , to let him know . He ' s speechless . You ' re playing the wrong record , he complains . Didn ' t matter_to me . I didn ' t need any market research to know a hit . Until recently , I had forgotten a lot about those days . I ' m a stubborn kind of fellow , short and wiry and steel on the inside . I hate losing , and I pride myself on not looking_back . After Watts burned , I reluctantly let &quot; Burn , Baby , Burn ! &quot; slip out of my repertoire . It was stained . The Los Angeles Times had a front-page story the fourth day of the riots explaining that the &quot; hep &quot; slogan had been &quot; borrowed &quot; from the radio , but that wasn ' t enough to salvage it . &quot; Magnificent Montague will ' burn ' no more , &quot; the black-owned L.A. Sentinel proclaimed . I told the kids , if you want to call KGJF and scream a dedication , scream , &quot; Have Mercy ! &quot; And they did , and I did , too , and my show on KGFJ continued through 1966 , the greatest_year R &amp; B music ever saw , an endless sweaty parade of Otis Redding and Sam and Dave , Stevie Wonder and Eddie Floyd , Johnnie Taylor and Wilson Pickett -- music so simultaneously hard-edged and tender , rhythmic and melodic , lurid and sacred , gospel and gutbucket that an hour of my show could leave you slumping over your car ' s steering_wheel , gasping for breath . Soul music , we called it , a brief but glorious marriage of R &amp; B at midnight and church on Sunday morning . But my fascination ebbed . Radio was getting too profitable to be left to the DJs . Programming gurus were already institutionalizing the Top 40 format , playlists were replacing the instincts of the jocks , FM was replacing AM . I left KGFJ in 1967 , broadcast for a_couple_of years on L.A. ' s legendary XERB with Wolfman Jack , then set my sights on producing records and developing new radio_stations . Meanwhile , &quot; Burn , Baby , Burn ! &quot; was adopted by protesters of all races . In New York , black demonstrators , angered by a murder acquittal , yelled it as a threat . In Berkeley , flag-burners screamed it on the eve of a Supreme Court decision . In South Carolina , capital_punishment advocates chanted it outside execution sites . I didn ' t care . Then , nine years ago , on the 20th anniversary of Watts , I got a call from a white guy at The Times named Bob Baker , pitching a what-happened-to-you ? story . I would n ' t talk to him . He wrote me a letter , told me that 20 years ago he ' d been a fan , that in some weird way soul music had rescued him . I gave_in . He drove down to Palm Springs , where my wife and I owned and ran an easy-listening FM station . After a_couple_of hours of talking , I started to think_about what had happened to me , where my life fit . All those crazy times . Spinning Sam Cooke ' s &quot; You Send Me &quot; for six straight hours from midnight till dawn while broadcasting out of a furniture store in L.A. in 1958 . Refusing to sit in a blacks-only section at a Bobby Darin concert in St . Louis in 1960 and instead -- at Bobby ' s demand , once he heard about the nonsense -- introducing him onstage . Watching Johnny Ace shoot himself to death playing Russian roulette backstage in Houston in 1954 . Having Malcolm X come_to my apartment in New York in 1962 and use my black history collection to research those riveting street-corner speeches he gave on 125th Street . Making public introductions during the L.A. mayoral campaigns of a man I ' d first met when he was a cop , Tom Bradley . I began to recognize that the black experience wasn ' t merely something that I ' d collected . It was something that I ' d lived , something that I ' d helped shape . If history was chasing me , maybe I ' d let it catch_up . See , I want stories like mine , bigger than mine , in the black history museum I ' m going_to develop . I want hundreds , thousands of them . I want to take my collection out of storage in a warehouse and lay it out_in a place where history can leap_out at you . Where you can walk the path of my people . Where you not only listen and read about the pain and the glory but you feel it . Where the video screens roll the images and the speakers burst_forth , and the greats , the Booker T . Washingtons and the Frederick Douglasses , share the podium with the anonymous strugglers . I want you to hold_in your hand the 12 1 / 2-cent pamphlet written in 1850 by fugitive slave Henry Watson . I want you to watch the silent_movies of 1916 by the black-owned Lincoln Motion_Picture Co . of Los Angeles . I want you to sing along to &quot; It Pays to Serve Jesus &quot; by the Pace Jubilee Singers . I want to overwhelm you with the power of contralto Marian Anderson ' s Negro_spirituals and classics . I want to bombard you with computerized special_effects to make you well_up with tears at the sheer brilliance of Dr. George_Washington Carver . We have the technological power now to show the course of a man ' s life in the span of five minutes : a sickly Alabama slave child , stolen from his mother , repurchased by his owner for the price of a horse , miraculously rising to earn a master ' s degree in agriculture , inventing the economic miracle of crop rotation by alternating cotton with peanuts , then developing more_than 100 peanut byproducts . Behold a replica of his laboratory , his letters , an original painting he did with peanut_oils . Behold this inspiration -- inspiration for all Americans . Step inside my museum and touch my heart . That is my dream . I want to tell these stories to reach the youngsters who have the energy and the intensity to succeed but don ' t know their history . I don ' t want to tell it to them . I want to show it to them . These gang members , these rappers -- once they understand their history , there ' ll be no holding them back . I will give them something more powerful than their AK-47s . I will give them their BHDs , their black history degrees . I will show them how to soar , like the Black Eagle .</TEXT>
