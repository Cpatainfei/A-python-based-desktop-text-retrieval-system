   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON BOSNIA ; RUSSIA STEPS INTO THE FRAY . . . ; WHILE THE WEST IS RIGHT TO BE WARY , A BALKAN SETTLEMENT THAT INCLUDES MOSCOW HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF ENDURING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the West paid almost no attention , Balkan politics underwent a major shift of terrain last week : Russia has just weighed in_for the first time on the Bosnian fray , an event laden with implications for the future of NATO policy , Russia ' s world role and Russian internal politics . First , while NATO and Washington express pleasure that &quot; their &quot; Bosnian policy is beginning to work -- with the Serbs ' apparent pullback from their brutal siege of Sarajevo -- it is in fact due_to the Russians that such an event has come_about . The Russians have overnight become a key player in the politics of the former Yugoslavia , where they had been shut_out ever since the end of World_War_II . Russia is the first external player to have any clout with the Serbs , so its role could well fill a gap in a useful way . To those deeply suspicious of Russian imperial intentions , however , this is bad news , for it could indicate that the Russian bear has now &quot; extended its claws &quot; into Eastern Europe for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall . It is vastly premature , however , to make any call about &quot; the Russian bear. &quot; While Russian democracy is far from perfect and Russia is indeed in economic turmoil , there is no real evidence of reversion to the old Cold_War ideological split or a Russian challenge to the West in the old sense . There are wild imperialists in Russia -- Vladimir Zhirinovsky being the most flagrant example . But Russia is a great_power , and it will certainly have great-power interests in its neighborhood and beyond . The question is , what kind of a Russia will it be ? Will its motivations be reasonably compatible with those of the West ? So far , these interests of Russia cannot be described as incompatible , even in NATO and Washington eyes . That could change , however , if Russian politics should lurch into ultra-nationalist visions and authoritarian methods . Boris N . Yeltsin has probably strengthened his domestic position by this stunning decision to weigh in on Bosnia . He has been under pressure from the right to go beyond simple pursuit of &quot; me-tooism &quot; policies that agree with the West on all major issues . He has probably restored some element of Russian pride . Many Russians -- hardly all_of them zealots -- believe that Russia should have elements of an &quot; independent &quot; foreign_policy , based on its own unique interests . But what are those interests ? Serbia shares with Russia both Eastern Orthodox Christianity and a Slav tradition -- although Croats and Bosnians are Slavs , too . Is this enough ? Is Serbia really of critical interest to Russia ? Can Serbia outweigh economic interests or relations with Germany or good economic ties with the Czechs and Hungarians ? Does Russia merely want to champion a client , or to play a broader and more constructive game in the region ? The likely answer is that Russia still is casting_about in foreign-policy confusion following the collapse of its empire and finds that this is at least one area where it still has clout . Russians want to be perceived as a significant player -- and they can now do so for the first time in East European politics . Washington and NATO have thus been delivered a fait_accompli in Bosnia . Russia ' s role may be positive ; done right , Russian activism in Bosnia and the Security_Council could be constructive . A Balkan settlement that includes Russia may be harder to reach , but it may also be more enduring if Russia can influence the key players , the Serbs , and as long as Moscow ' s purpose is not simply to blindly check Western policies . We are likely to see significant other new departures in Russian foreign_policy , gradually revealing the face of the new Russia -- and , it is hoped , demonstrating policies different from those during the Cold_War . These developments do not have to be bad news for the West , but the West will not be wrong in feeling ambivalence about this important event .</TEXT>
