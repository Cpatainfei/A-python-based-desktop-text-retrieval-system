   <TEXT> Reacting to election-year public ire over crime , the Senate on Monday night unanimously approved an Orange County lawmaker ' s bill that would slap first-time child_molesters and some rapists with sentences of 25 years to life . The Senate voted 33-0 to send the so-called &quot; one-strike &quot; legislation carried by Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) to the Assembly . Bergeson began carrying the bill at the behest of Gov . Pete Wilson , who has made the rape measure a centerpiece of his election-year fight on crime . She portrayed the measure as the strongest effort to deal with sexual predators in years . &quot; Three strikes is too many -- their first strike should be their last , &quot; Bergeson said , adding that &quot; it is time to portray rapists and child_molesters for what they are -- dangerous felons who should not be allowed to repeat their crimes. &quot; When first proposed , the bill called_for a blanket sentence of life without the possibility of parole for nearly all sex offenses . That tough stance drew broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups , including some district_attorneys and women ' s organizations , who said the measure was so harsh it might actually hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to kill their victims . After an abortive attempt to push the measure through committee in April , Bergeson redrafted the bill to delete all references_to sentences of life without parole , substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for most serious offenses . As now drafted , a rapist or child_molester could get the maximum sentence of 25 years to life only if one of the following circumstances applied : The victim was kidnaped ; he or she suffered great bodily injury ; the rape was committed during a burglary ; a deadly weapon was used ; multiple victims were attacked , or the rapist had a previous felony conviction for a sex offense . Under current law , the penalties for various sex crimes range from three to eight years in prison , but most prisoners are paroled after serving about half their sentences . Bergeson ' s measure could face tough scrutiny in the Assembly ' s Public Safety Committee , a longtime burial_ground for tough anti-crime legislation . Her bill also will be competing against one sponsored by Assemblyman Bob Epple ( D-Cerritos ) , who chairs the Assembly Public Safety Committee . Epple ' s measure would apply a life sentence only when rape was committed during a kidnaping or residential burglary at_the_same_time that a weapon was used or a victim suffered great bodily harm .</TEXT>
