   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' AUTRY OF THE WEST ' : A PLEASANT NOSTALGIC TRIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of its weekend Film Preservation Festival , American Movie Classics is tipping its 10-gallon hat to cowboy star Gene Autry in the hourlong videography &quot; Gene Autry : Melody of the West. &quot; And a nice piece of nostalgia it is , too . Narrated by singer Johnny Cash , the program takes a fond look_back at Autry ' s remarkable life and career , and the audiences who took the singing cowboy to their hearts . It ' s almost a saga . Autry was born in 1907 in Tioga , Tex. , and was reared in Oklahoma . He witnessed firsthand the closing of the Western frontier and even saw some outlaws firsthand -- he was robbed at gunpoint while working as a railway_station clerk . It was_on that same job that he was discovered -- by Will Rogers , no less . Autry began singing cowboy songs on the radio in 1928 and by 1934 had worked his way to Hollywood , where he appeared in a Ken Maynard Western . He next starred in a Mascot serial , &quot; Phantom Empire , &quot; which featured Autry ' s singing , and the rest is movie history . He went_on to make 58 Westerns at Republic and another 34 at Columbia , starred on radio for 16 years and on television for five , and sold more_than 50 million records , including the second biggest-selling single of all time , &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. &quot; &quot; Gene Autry : Melody of the West &quot; does an especially nice job of taking_notice of some of the people who contributed to his career , including Gail Davis , his most frequent leading lady ; Smiley Burnette and Pat Buttram , his longtime sidekicks ; and Yakima Canutt , who performed many of Autry ' s stunts in the early years . Curiously , there is only one mention of Roy Rogers , the singer who got his start in an Autry movie and went_on to become the biggest singing cowboy star of them all . Nor is there any mention of Autry ' s business acumen , of the broadcasting empire he built , or of his frustrated ownership of the California Angels . But maybe his younger fans would regard that as soft stuff , like kissin ' the pretty girl . * &quot; Gene Autry : Melody of the West &quot; airs at 10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. Sunday on cable ' s AMC channel . The morning showing will be preceded by screenings of Autry ' s only two color Westerns : &quot; The Big Sombrero &quot; at 7:30 a.m. and &quot; Strawberry Roan &quot; at 9 a.m .</TEXT>
