   <TEXT> The fuzzy delight of bringing into the family a kitten or puppy for the holidays has been made a lot more affordable , thanks to the Mercy Crusade , a nonprofit animal care corporation . Dogs , puppies , cats and kittens can be adopted Tuesday through Thursday for $ 10 plus licensing_fee at the Agoura animal shelter and the other five county shelters . Adoptions usually cost at least $ 40 , according to Bob Ballenger , executive assistant , Los Angeles County Animal Care and Control Department . Mercy Crusade donates the money for all spaying , neutering and shots to allow families that may_not otherwise be able to afford a pet to have one . Last year , more_than 400 animals were adopted by families through the Mercy Crusade program . MAKI BECKER</TEXT>
