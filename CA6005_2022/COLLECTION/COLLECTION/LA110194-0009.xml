   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; GOTHONI IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEBUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> According to his biography , Ralf Gothoni , the 48-year old Finnish musician who took the 1994 Gilmore Award -- a potentially career-making , cash-and-engagements prize worth &quot; in the neighborhood of $ 500 # 000 , &quot; its sponsors say -- is a solo pianist , a conductor , a composer , a chamber musician , a &quot; lieder pianist &quot; and a festival director . How the reserved , young-looking Gothoni carries_off his other musical endeavors , one can only guess . In his debut piano recital Sunday night in Schoenberg Hall Auditorium at UCLA , the observant listener could admire Gothoni ' s undoubted versatility , his clear perspective and his effortless , if not comprehensive , technique . Nevertheless , this event was not an occasion for rejoicing . Gothoni may get_around the keyboard with ease , but the sounds of the sensible music he regularly makes often prove unpleasant . Above mezzo-forte , in the dynamic area where most of his playing takes_place , he abuses the instrument and his listeners ' ears consistently . The tone he makes at that level is metallic and ugly . Spending 90 minutes in his pianistic presence is not necessarily a treat . The more rewarding half of this event involved Schubert ' s monumental B-flat Sonata , one quarter of which Gothoni played with deep concentration and a mostly becalmed sound . Many if not all_of the beauties in the seraphic opening movement emerged persuasive and contexted -- even , on occasion , legato . His rhetoric proved convincing -- he gives good pause -- and he took , surprisingly and admirably , the repeat of the exposition . This was cherishable piano-playing . The rest of the sonata fell_short_of these ideals . The Andante sostenuto lacked color and nuance , and too often became glib . The quickish Scherzo failed of clarity and eschewed the composer ' s asked-for delicatezza entirely . The finale , raw and over-exuberant , asked the musical question : How can a 48-year old professional pianist play with so little polish ? The first_half of the recital used a charming Aria by Domenico Zipoli as prelude to Liszt ' s exposing B-minor Sonata . Though laid_out cannily and with strong understanding , Gothoni ' s playing of the sonata told us nothing new about it , and too_much about his hit-and-run approach to the piano .</TEXT>
