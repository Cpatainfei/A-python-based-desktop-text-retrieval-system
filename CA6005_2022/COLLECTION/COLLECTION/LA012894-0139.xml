   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN GOVERNMENT , 8 POLITICAL PARTIES SIGN REFORM PACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Mexican government and eight political_parties signed an agreement Thursday calling_for sweeping and unprecedented electoral reforms in an attempt to end a peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas . The agreement took a giant step toward meeting one of the central demands of the Zapatista National Liberation Army , which launched a New Year ' s Day insurgency calling_for indigenous rights and political empowerment through clean and just elections . It also held_out the prospect of loosening the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ' s grip on Mexican politics . The party has dominated the government for 64 years , often through the use of electoral fraud . The agreement calls_for , among other things , independent electoral authorities , an end to the use of government funds by any political_party and a prosecutor to pursue those accused of electoral fraud . It also calls_for fair treatment of all parties in the Mexican media , which traditionally have given most of their coverage to ruling-party candidates . Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo MacGregor , announcing the agreement , said special_sessions of the Mexican Congress will be called if necessary to change laws to codify the reforms .</TEXT>
