   <HEADLINE> 3 VENTURA COUNTY DEATHS LINKED TO VALLEY_FEVER ; HEALTH : TWO MORE NAMES ARE ADDED TO EARLIER REPORT OF A MAN WHO SUCCUMBED TO THE QUAKE-RELATED ILLNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal disease officials confirmed Tuesday that three Ventura County residents died of valley_fever , an airborne fungus carried_on clouds of dust kicked_up by the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake . Initially , the Centers_for_Disease_Control reported that a 71-year-old Simi Valley man died in March in an unprecedented outbreak of 203 cases of the flu-like illness that followed the earthquake . But after further investigation , the agency attached two more deaths -- a 56-year-old Oxnard man in May and a 71-year-old Newbury Park woman in June -- to the valley_fever outbreak , a CDC epidemiologist said . The three deaths will be outlined in a report that the CDC plans to forward in two weeks to the Ventura County Public Health Services_Department , said the CDC ' s Dr. Eileen Schneider . * Schneider and other federal researchers began investigating the connection between valley_fever and the earthquake after Ventura County logged four times more cases in a_few weeks than it had reported in all_of 1993 . Schneider would not name the people who died , citing their families ' right_to_privacy . The Newbury Park woman died of valley fever-related pneumonia about two months after she was diagnosed with the illness , Schneider said . The Oxnard man , who had suffered diabetes and other medical problems , also died about two months after being diagnosed , she said . &quot; It ' s not unusual that people die of valley_fever , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; It ' s rare , but it does occur. &quot; Valley_fever is actually a fungal_infection scientists call coccidioidomycosis . The fungus lives in the earth , but the Jan . 17 earthquake and hundreds of aftershocks threw it into the air in tan-colored clouds of dust , researchers believe . And hundreds of people -- particularly in Simi Valley and eastern Ventura County -- inhaled the spores . * In about 60 % of cases , the infection produces no symptoms . But within about two to five weeks of inhaling the spores , some people experience flu-like exhaustion , coughing , high fever and even pneumonia . The illness usually hits older people the hardest . More_than 120 of the 203 earthquake-related cases of valley_fever afflicted Simi Valley residents , while about 40 were found in Thousand Oaks and even fewer in Westlake Village and Camarillo . Last year , before the earthquake , there were only 52 cases of valley_fever diagnosed in all_of Ventura County . The earthquake-related cases were noted on a map in the county public health department , which showed that valley_fever spores might have spread_out southwesterly from Simi Valley toward Thousand Oaks on seaward breezes before thinning_out over the Oxnard Plain . The magnitude 6.8 earthquake was centered in the San Fernando Valley , but health officials there have reported little change in the numbers of people infected there : Only 46 cases had been reported there by late August .</TEXT>
