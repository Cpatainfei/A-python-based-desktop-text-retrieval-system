   <HEADLINE> DRIVE TO BRING WORLD CUP TO U.S. BEGAN ON FATEFUL DAY IN ' 84</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all intents and purposes , the World Cup Soccer Tournament started coming_to America sometime in the early afternoon of Thursday , Aug . 9 , 1984 . Alan Rothenberg , the man who would eventually lead the effort to get the World Cup here , and who is now the CEO of World Cup USA , was in a quandary that day . He was the soccer commissioner for the ' 84 Olympics , and he had been looking_forward to a calm before the storm of the soccer final two nights later at the Rose Bowl . All he had_on his plate that day was the third-place game , matching Yugoslavia and Italy . The Rose Bowl then held about 100 # 000 for soccer and Rothenberg and his crew expected half that for the consolation game . Being American , he knew how U.S. sports fans reacted to games that were for something other_than the championship . They ignored them . Shortly after noon , he received word that the Rose Bowl parking_lots were swarming with people lining_up to buy tickets for that night ' s game . And there was nowhere near enough tickets . Rothenberg and his associates , fearing a riot , had additional tickets rushed in . That night , Yugoslavia beat Italy , 2-1 , in front of 100 # 374 people . And the rest of the world , especially those who pay close attention to soccer , couldn ' t help but notice . The seed had been planted . Maybe soccer could come_to the richest country in the world for its quadrennial showcase . Between that day in August , 1984 , and 1989 , much was happening behind the scenes on the international level . But Rothenberg knew he needed to make a move_on the national level . The U.S. Soccer Federation , to most observers , lacked the sophistication to pull_off the hosting of a World Cup . It was a disjointed organization that was still raising some funds with bake sales . As the time for election of the head of the U.S. Soccer Federation neared , Rothenberg moved_in with a well-organized campaign befitting the well-respected Los Angeles lawyer . In 1990 , he was elected president and all who followed his quick ascent understood that , not only would the World Cup in the United States take_on the organizational attributes of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committeebut that he would expertly maneuver his hometowninto the central role . On July 17 , the World Cup_finals will be played_at the Rose Bowl . It will be just 23 days shy of 10 years since 100 # 374 fans shocked Rothenberg and showed the world this might be a good place for a soccer tournament after all .</TEXT>
