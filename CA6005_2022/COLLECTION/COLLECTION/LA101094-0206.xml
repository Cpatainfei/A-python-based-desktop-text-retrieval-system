   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : FRONT ROW SEAT ON JAPAN-U.S. TRADE ; COMMERCE : RYOZO YANAGIUSHI , WHO RUNS CYPRESS COMPLEX OF ELECTRONICS GIANT MATSUSHITA , HAS WATCHED THE ACTION FOR 35 YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When trade disputes rage , the distant thunder can be heard in the quiet industrial_parks of Cypress . Here , behind manicured lawns on gently rolling slopes , are titans of Japanese industry like the Western headquarters of Matsushita Electric Corp . of America . It is a name that would mean nothing to the average person until you roll_off the brands it represents -- Panasonic , Quasar and Technics . Matsushita sold $ 6.5 billion worth of electronics , from laptop_computers to camcorders , in North_America in its most recent fiscal_year . So when the United States and Japan talk trade , Matsushita has more_than a passing interest . So , too , does Ryozo ( Ricky ) Yanagiushi , the vice_president who oversees the company ' s sprawling 25-acre complex in Cypress . An unassuming , gracious 58-year-old , Yanagiushi is also chairman of the Orange County chapter of the Japan Business Assn . of Southern California , a trade promotion group . He watched as the United States and Japan announced a breakthrough trade agreement a week ago that could make_it easier for American manufacturers to sell medical and telecommunications_equipment to the Japanese government , and for makers of flat glass to enter a market that has been virtually closed to them . But the agreements stopped short of American negotiators ' largest goal : a bigger piece of the automotive parts business , which accounts_for two-thirds of the nation ' s $ 60-billion annual trade_deficit with Japan . For Yanagiushi , these events are only the latest chapter in a struggle he has seen unfold over a 35-year career at Matsushita from both sides of the Pacific . In an interview late last week , Yanagiushi shared his thoughts on the latest trade talks and U.S.-Japanese relations in_general : Question : What do you think the trade agreements will ultimately mean ? Answer : My general feeling is that this event , as reported , is a very happy ending to the series of negotiations . Those key issues have come_to an agreement , except for auto parts . Those three areas ( agreed upon ) will set a basis for future agreements . * Q : Are Americans closing the quality gap ? A : In electronic parts imported to Japan , this quality gap became the key issue in the last 10 years . We were enthusiastic about importing from the States . We did really extensive study and negotiations with U.S. vendors . There had been a rather large gap in quality , which was not accepted in Japan . It ' s a fascinating game you have to go_through . And one by one , it can be changed on both sides . * Q : How can it be changed ? A : ( Japanese ) quality-minded manufacturing systems want ( American parts ) as equal in quality to their own domestic parts as possible . The robotization , or automatic manufacturing system ( in Japan ) , is very precise . U.S. suppliers had to adjust themselves to feed into those systems . * Q : Are Japanese customers ready to buy American goods ? A : I think that , especially last year , American automobiles have been gaining popularity . The total number of cars sold is small , but the rate_of_growth is high . * Q : What kind of Japanese customer would want to buy an American car , the ones who want to stand_out ? A : Those who want to stand_out is one segment . That has been there for many years , but that did not support the numbers of cars being sold from the States now . These days it ' s because American cars are reasonably priced . * Q : Is the quality of the cars better ? A : Consumers in Japan feel that American cars are up again in quality . * Q : Why would n ' t the Japanese government , then , not want American auto parts sold in Japan ? A : I can appreciate the government ' s attitude of not being able to force the private sector to buy them . Japan ' s system is not that way . They have a certain limit of guiding the private sector . * Q : And that ' s good ? A : Yes . The trend shows that American components coming_into Japan have more room for growth because Japanese auto_manufacturers are eager to expand the import portion of their components . Therefore , I think U.S. suppliers who are there and successful are not complaining . But since there are varieties of auto parts manufacturers in the States who want to sell in Japan , they want to see easier access . * Q : Do you think the progress being made in trade talks is a result of the Japanese government ' s fear of sanctions ? A : Of course . * Q : Is that good , that the United States should be acting through threat rather than mutual cooperation ? A : I , of course , would like to see more dialogue in front-line talks that can be the basis for any negotiations . The talk will reflect the political situation of both countries . * Q : Is the Japanese government protectionist ? A : They are not protectionist at all . . . . Newcomers have to learn ( how to break_into Japanese business ) . For the government to satisfy foreign suppliers , they have to lower the bar for everybody . . . and that takes time . * Q : Given how low prices are for the same products here as they are in Japan , particularly rice , isn ' t that proof that Japan has kept the barriers too high ? A : Well that hasn ' t been set artificially . When we look_around and see the ( price ) difference , particularly with the States , we came_to know that it is quite a big difference . There is an effort to make_it narrower . * Q : How about the United States ? In your experience as an importer here , have you encountered trade_barriers ? A : Punitive tariffs are imposed on color_TVs . That has really worked for the United States . There are no complete color_TVs coming_in today from the outside . Manufacturers like us are manufacturing here . * Q : It ' s been said that the United States was shortsighted in adopting such a policy because it virtually guarantees that foreign manufacturers will set_up plants here and forever be shipping the profits back to their home countries . Your assessment ? A : I think it ' s a good thing that the plants were built here . Perhaps it ' s not as good for our colleagues in Japan , because there are fewer jobs . But we are a multinational operation and we consider it positively . We want to be a real corporate citizen . . . . For us , it is good if the trade agreements encourage global activities so that good things produced in certain places can be supportive of other areas . Today , we are exporting American-made color_TVs to Japan -- built_in Illinois -- and microwave_ovens to Europe . * Q : As more Japanese plants open overseas , won ' t it eventually mean more unemployment in Japan ? A : We will be able to keep new things . We will be able to take_care of ourselves . * Q : How are relations overall between the United States and Japan ? A : We feel a lot easier than last week ( laughs ) . * Q : Are the Japanese people thinking better of the United States these days ? A : I think so . The Japanese people are more cost-oriented . The economic recession has hit everyone , and they are looking_for something better . They are price conscious and value conscious . When the economy peaked , people thought they could reach for anything . They wanted luxury . Not today . Today , they want reasonable price , which is a good thing . The same thing has taken_place in the States . * Q : Are American workers still viewed_as lazy ? A : I think those kinds of extreme views are diminishing , and they are not popular at all .</TEXT>
