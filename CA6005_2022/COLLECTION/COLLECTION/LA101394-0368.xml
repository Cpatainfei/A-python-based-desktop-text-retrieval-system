   <HEADLINE> ' DREAM TEAM ' TRIO OUTLINE PLANS FOR STUDIO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Describing themselves as Hollywood ' s version of the &quot; dream team , &quot; entertainment executives Jeffrey Katzenberg , Steven Spielberg and David Geffen on Wednesday confirmed plans to launch a company from the ground up that will compete with the major studios . The unnamed company will be financed by the three partners in the early stages -- although sources said other investors from the communications world may eventually sign_on . It will focus_on five major areas : movie and TV production , animation , music and multimedia . &quot; We ' re all going_to do what we ' ve been doing , &quot; Spielberg said at a packed Beverly Hills news_conference Wednesday morning . &quot; We ' re just going_to hopefully do_it better. &quot; News of their plans rocked the Hollywood community . Katzenberg , Spielberg and Geffen are the most powerful creative executives to combine forces behind a new entertainment company in recent memory -- perhaps the most powerful since Charlie Chaplin , Mary Pickford , Douglas Fairbanks and D . W . Griffith combined to form United Artists at the birth of the industry . If the trio prevails , theirs will be the first studio successfully launched in more_than a decade . They may also help to transform the way business is done_in Hollywood , since the company is structured as a streamlined alternative to its competitors . &quot; If they can really pull this off , it will change the face of the industry , &quot; said filmmaker Bob Zemeckis , a friend of Spielberg and collaborator on such hits as the &quot; Back to the Future &quot; film series and &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? &quot; Zemeckis , whose &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; has grossed more_than $ 270 million at the box_office , added , &quot; They are a unique mixture . We haven ' t seen anything like this since the old UA days . These are three guys are passionate about movies. &quot; Katzenberg , the former Walt Disney Studios chief who had hits such_as &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Pretty Woman &quot; to his credit before a falling_out with company Chairman Michael D . Eisner , is expected to manage the day-to-day operations of the company . Spielberg , the most successful director in Hollywood history ( &quot; Jaws , &quot; &quot; E.T. , &quot; &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; ) will fold his Amblin Entertainment into the company after fulfilling existing commitments , but will still take directing jobs with other studios . Geffen , who created Asylum and Geffen Records , will launch a record label there . Initially , at least , they said they will focus_on quality over volume . Spielberg said the company would be &quot; about ideas &quot; and a happy &quot; playground &quot; for creative talent . Katzenberg added that there will be no limit on budgets or the level of talent they will work with . The executives said they intend to be very hands-on at the company , but sources pointed_out that not everything they touch has turned_to gold . Katzenberg suffered through years of live-action losers at Disney , including &quot; Blank_Check &quot; and &quot; Cabin Boy. &quot; In addition to his many hits , Spielberg has had his name on disappointments such_as &quot; Always &quot; and &quot; Empire of the Sun. &quot; And Geffen has distanced himself from the operations of his record company in recent years , leading some to question whether he can build another label . Egos may also become a factor as the company moves forward , since the partners are known as three of the most controlling executives in Hollywood . Speaking of their futures , Katzenberg said : &quot; We ' re looking_at this as a lifetime commitment for the three of us. &quot; Said Spielberg : &quot; We ' re interested in creating a company that will outlive us all. &quot; Added Geffen : &quot; I ' ve always been_on my own , but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with partners . . . . I haven ' t had this much anxiety in 20 years. &quot; Nor has Hollywood seen such an ambitious new company born in many years . Barbra Streisand , Sidney Portier and Paul Newman created First Artists Production Co . in 1969 -- and failed . Director / producer Francis Ford Coppola also failed with his filmmaker-friendly American Zoetrope studio in the 1980s . Orion Pictures , formed in 1978 , had a run of success until a string of bad movies led to a bankruptcy filing in 1992 . TriStar Pictures , formed by CBS , Home Box_Office and Columbia Pictures in 1983 , lives on as a subsidiary of troubled Sony Pictures Entertainment . And Savoy Pictures , the most recent entry , is still establishing itself . Katzenberg , Spielberg and Geffen hope to get a leg up by making their company leaner , faster-moving and more financially creative than the competition . Breaking Disney ' s virtual lock on animation is one goal . Spielberg and Katzenberg said feature animation will be a cornerstone of the company . &quot; Jeffrey and I have been horrendously competitive for years , and my appetite for animation has not diminished , &quot; said Spielberg , who made &quot; Roger Rabbit &quot; for Katzenberg at Disney . TV is another area where the company is expected to be aggressive and innovative . Sources say that it will be willing to offer more favorable financial terms to the networks than its competitors . Katzenberg is known to have strong ties to executives at Capital Cities / ABC . Moreover , the partners have not ruled_out a bid for a network . Multimedia is a special_interest of Spielberg ' s . The director already has a deal with Knowledge Adventure , a multimedia software company . But he said that would not preclude him from working_on separate projects for the new company . A typical problem for start-up companies is financing , since it takes years to build_up the libraries that see established studios through the lean times . But competitors say the Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen team will probably clear that hurdle too . &quot; They ' re a powerful force because the three of them are all so unique and so good at what they do , &quot; said Robert Daly , Warner Bros . co-chairman . &quot; They ' re starting from scratch , so this won ' t be something you ' ll see tomorrow . But are they a major competitor ? Absolutely. &quot; Added Paramount Pictures Chief Sherry Lansing : &quot; It ' s the most amazing combination of geniuses . . . I think they can do anything they set their minds to. &quot; &quot; This is as if Babe_Ruth , Lou Gerhig and Joe DiMaggio got_together , &quot; said Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein . &quot; It ' s the entertainment hall_of_fame of all time. &quot; Details about the new company are sketchy , because it was pulled_together very quickly . But sources say it is likely to align itself initially with Universal Pictures parent MCA Inc. , where Spielberg and Geffen have long-running ties . Spielberg ' s company is based there , in an adobe complex built for him after the success of &quot; E.T. &quot; Geffen , who sold his record company to MCA , works there under a contract ending this year . Sources said that any ties between the new company and MCA are predicated on MCA Chairman Lew R . Wasserman and President Sidney J . Sheinberg remaining in place . Both are in the midst of contract discussions . Sources said the new company could use MCA for everything from theatrical distribution and merchandising services to video and pay TV deals . There was even speculation that Katzenberg , Spielberg and Geffen eventually will try to purchase a controlling stake in MCA from its parent , Matsushita Electric Industrial Co . &quot; I would hope MCA would continue to have a relationship with this entity if it ' s considered appropriate by them and us , &quot; said Sheinberg , who was attending an MCA management retreat . &quot; We would look_forward to being able to do that and I think they would too. &quot; Katzenberg described the new company as a &quot; sovereign state. &quot; But it was one that was formed very quickly . The contracts were signed only three days ago , and it was only six weeks ago that Katzenberg was forced_out at Disney after an unsuccessful bid to be named president of the parent company . Katzenberg ' s career campaign resulted in a very public feud with Eisner , whom he had worked with for 19 years , beginning at Paramount Pictures . After exploring three options -- fixing a troubled company , expanding an existing successful company or starting his own enterprise with partners -- Katzenberg decided on a new company , telling one confidant : &quot; At the end of the day I asked myself , ' Do I want to get involved in somebody else ' s creation ? ' . . . This is getting_up on the high_wire and literally putting ourselves at risk with the challenge and rewards of trying to build something from scratch. &quot; Spielberg and Geffen are Katzenberg ' s two best_friends . The entrepreneurial Geffen had been pushing Katzenberg to go_into business with him . Spielberg , who had always resisted overtures to form his own company , also was open_to the idea of teaming_up . He and Katzenberg are already partners in DIVE ! , a restaurant venture that ' s designed to become a national chain . Actor Tom Hanks on Wednesday jokingly told Spielberg they should call their new venture &quot; DIVE ! -- the Studio. &quot; Spielberg relayed a story at the news_conference about how he and his wife , actress Kate Capshaw , were visiting Zemeckis and his wife at their vacation house in Jamaica when he learned that Katzenberg was leaving Disney . According to Zemeckis , Katzenberg suggested at that time that Katzenberg and Spielberg should start a studio . &quot; I don ' t know if it was a joke or if Jeffrey was half kidding , but I think the seed my have been planted , &quot; Zemeckis said . Katzenberg said Eisner called all three to congratulate them on the new company Wednesday morning . He added that his rift with Eisner is healing &quot; and that the hurt ' s behind us. &quot; However , Katzenberg has retained lawyers to negotiate a settlement of his contract with Disney , and many people expect the multimillion-dollar disagreement to end_up in court . Wednesday ' s news_conference not only drew one of the largest media crowds covering an entertainment related announcement , but an uncharacteristically large collection of Hollywood power_brokers including Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer , whose Creative Artists Agency represents Spielberg , International Creative Management President Jim Wiatt and United Talent Agency partner Jim Berkus and several of Katzenberg ' s still-loyal Disney executives . The new company still lacks headquarters and a staff , as well as clear , long-term financing . Sources familiar_with entertainment funding said it will need $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion in capital to go_forward with its ambitious plans . No one believes that the partners will foot the entire bill , even though Spielberg and Geffen are personally capable of doing so . Katzenberg said the company will not go public . Sources agreed that the three executives can raise all_the money they need from private sources , and that a public offering would expose them to more scrutiny than they ' re likely to be willing to put_up with . &quot; I would think that Katzenberg would very much want to avoid the public forum , &quot; one source said . &quot; The results are too publicly known . He needs to keep his aura about him. &quot; Should they change their minds , raising money publicly will also be easier once the company is up and running , sources say . Getting a movie into theaters from scratch can take as long as 18 months , but the new company could accelerate that timeline by acquiring existing projects other studios have soured on . Amblin and Geffen Films also have projects in the works . Sources pointed_out that Disney , which has said that it plans to scale back production , could find a willing buyer for its orphaned projects in Katzenberg . Given their recent bad_blood , however , Eisner may_not be anxious to jump-start Katzenberg ' s company . &quot; One significant question is whether Eisner allows anything to go_to Katzenberg , &quot; said one source . &quot; If I were Eisner , I would n ' t put anything in turnaround. &quot; * FORMIDABLE RIVAL : Deal ' s impact in Hollywood . D1 Merger of the Moguls The new company , yet to be named , would be the first studio to be formed in more_than a decade . It initially will be funded by the partners and they plan to eventually raise as much as $ 2 billion for film , TV and record production . WHAT IT MEANS * The new company will create more competition for the major studios . * It is expected to become heavily involved in feature animation . * It will create a new record label through David Geffen . * It will explore opportunities in new media . * It may partner with other private investors . OTHER STUDIO STARTUPS Paramount : 1912 Universal : 1912 20th Century Fox : 1915 United Artists : 1919 Walt Disney : 1923 Warner Bros. : 1923 MGM : 1924 Columbia : 1924 Orion : 1978 Tristar : 1982 * CAREER CHANGES Katzenberg : New venture gives him a company to run after resiging from Disney . Spielberg : Amblin Entertainment , his production company , will be folded into new studio . Geffen : He plans to leave MCA Inc. ' s Geffen Records to work exclusively for new entity .</TEXT>
