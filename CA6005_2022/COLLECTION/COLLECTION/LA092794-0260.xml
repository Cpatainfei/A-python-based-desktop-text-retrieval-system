   <HEADLINE> OUTBREAK OF PLAGUE IS NOW UNDER CONTROL , INDIA SAYS ; HEALTH : EPIDEMIC HAS KILLED 41 IN WESTERN CITY , CAUSED MASS EXODUS . SOME FEAR SPREAD OF DISEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Health officials reported Monday that India ' s first outbreak of plague in nearly three decades is firmly under_control , but they were still hunting carriers of the deadly bacillus who , they said , had become as dangerous as &quot; human bombs. &quot; As of Monday , 41 deaths from pneumonic_plague had been registered in the western city of Surat near the Arabian_Sea coast , and 453 cases of the highly contagious_disease were suspected in the city . The officials called those numbers encouraging proof that the spread of the dreaded illness , which has already killed 12 million Indians this century , had been checked . &quot; It is down . It is under_control , &quot; said Dr. N . J . Kar , chief medical_officer at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi . No new deaths had been reported in the previous 24 hours , officials of the Health Ministry said Monday . Health Secretary M . S . Dayal had already given assurances that &quot; there is going_to be no large-scale outbreak. &quot; But others feared that the panicky exodus that had led to the outflow of up_to 400 # 000 of Surat ' s 2 million people since the epidemic was announced Thursday could spread the plague to the rest of India . Anyone carrying the bacterium might transmit it through a cough or sputum , medical officials said . Dayal and other Indian government officials flatly denied that any cases had been registered so far outside Surat , saying tests of all suspected victims had proven negative . But the Press Trust of India news_agency reported Monday that in Dhule , 120 miles east of Surat , a man who had fled the epidemic and was being treated for plague had died . In Rajkot , 150 miles northwest of Surat , one of several hundred people receiving treatment for plague-like symptoms died in a hospital , the agency said . In Ahmedabad , 120 miles north of Surat , six patients with similar symptoms were being kept_in isolation . In Bombay , 160 miles south of Surat , local health authorities quarantined 21 suspected plague victims in an isolation ward , United News of India said . Twelve were from Surat . Pneumonic plague is one of the three forms of the feared pestilence known in the Middle_Ages as the &quot; Black Death. &quot; In the 14th Century , plague killed an estimated 25 million people , or one-quarter the population of Europe . Plague is spread to humans by fleas that have bitten rats infected with the bacillus Pasteurella pestis . In its pneumonic form , the infection leads to high fever , the vomiting of blood and the filling of the lungs with fluid . Death occurs within three to four days . India ' s last plague cases were registered in 1966 , Kar said . Surat residents blamed their leaders for the resurgence of the disease . &quot; Municipal authorities allowed the garbage to pile_up in the city after the recent monsoon floods , &quot; said Pradip Saroi , who escaped over the weekend by taking the train to New Delhi . &quot; They did not take any preventive measures , nor was DDT sprayed. &quot; The precise toll may never be known , since people in Surat ' s poorer neighborhoods are believed to have cremated suspected plague victims without reporting their deaths . At least 93 people died this month while undergoing treatment for symptoms of malaria , dengue_fever , typhoid and cholera . Doctors said many of those deaths may have been caused by plague . Despite its macabre reputation , plague can be cured if a victim is rapidly given antibiotics . Over the weekend , 1 # 200 members of a medical &quot; strike force &quot; handed_out 1.2 million tablets of tetracycline in Surat as officials rushed in millions of additional doses . Around the Civil Hospital , paramilitary troops were deployed to prevent the hundreds who had been hospitalized from leaving . According to Dayal , 57 people fled the hospital during the first two days of the epidemic when they saw other people die . A senior Health Ministry official called the infected escapees &quot; human bombs , &quot; and police sent teams into infected neighborhoods to track them down . The plague returned to India for the first time in 28 years when a village in the Beed district of the neighboring state of Maharashtra reported its first case of bubonic_plague last month . The outbreak was blamed on a surge in the rat population drawn by relief food meant to help victims of last year ' s destructive earthquake . More_than 90 people were infected , but the bubonic outbreak was brought under_control by insecticide spraying and antibiotics . Bubonic plague constitutes about three-quarters of all plague cases , and it is less infectious and often milder in its symptoms than the pneumonic variety . Other nations took steps to guard against spread of the plague , and the United States , Russia and Japan offered to help fight the disease . U.S. officials were reported monitoring airports to watch for passengers arriving with the plague . Hong Kong , Pakistan , South_Korea , Thailand and the United Arab Emirates said they would examine travelers from India .</TEXT>
