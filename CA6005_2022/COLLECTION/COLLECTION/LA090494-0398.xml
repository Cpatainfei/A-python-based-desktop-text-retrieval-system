   <TEXT> One muggy August evening in 1978 , Maria Garcia tearfully kissed her two young daughters goodby in a small , Mexican town and boarded a bus bound for Tijuana . In the scraggly brush_on the outskirts of the city , a station_wagon waited to whisk her over the border and into the United States . Within hours , she was_on a plane to Chicago to join her husband . &quot; Our plan , &quot; she said , &quot; was to stay long enough to save some money , then go_back home. &quot; But despite several attempts to make ends meet in Mexico , the Garcias -- whose real names are not used because they risk deportation if identified -- were never able to return to their native_land . Today , home is Huntington Beach , where the couple eke_out a meager existence -- she cleaning_houses , he working as a mechanic ' s helper . They now have four children , all born in Mexico , who live with them . Ages 12 to 19 , all have attended Orange County public_schools . Now the lives they have established here face a new threat : Proposition 187 , which , if implemented , would put Garcia ' s children among the 400 # 000 youngsters statewide whom critics say would be kicked_out of public_school because they are in the country illegally . Though it flies in the face of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that grants all children , regardless of citizenship , the right to a public education , Proposition 187 would require school officials to verify the citizenship of all children . Those found to be undocumented would be expelled and reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service . The radical set of measures contained in Proposition 187 -- many of which also conflict with existing federal law -- would exclude illegal immigrants from non-emergency medical_care , welfare and other publicly funded social_services . The new law also would require officials at hospitals and social_service agencies to report to the INS anyone they suspect of being illegal immigrants . Backers of the measure -- also known as the &quot; Save Our State &quot; or &quot; SOS &quot; initiative -- assert that their ultimate goal is to save billions of taxpayer dollars and spark a national revolution in immigration policy . While opponents agree that something must be done to curb illegal immigration , they argue that the initiative is a shortsighted , misguided solution that will create far more problems than it solves . Garcia disputes the notion that the measure would discourage more illegal immigrants from coming_to the United States . &quot; All it will end_up doing is splitting families , &quot; she said . &quot; A lot of the men will come_over and work and the children will stay behind. &quot; In Orange County alone , thousands of children would be drummed_out of school if the initiative were implemented , opponents say . Left to roam the streets , they contend , these uneducated youngsters would likely compound the juvenile crime problem . The county ' s top public health official fear that the initiative would discourage illegal immigrants from seeking treatment for infectious_diseases -- a public health hazard for the entire community . Some social_services agencies receiving most of their funding from private donations defiantly assert that they would refuse to comply with the reporting requirement , even if it meant losing the state grants they also depend_on . &quot; The impact is just scary , &quot; says Gladys Hall-Kessler , president of the Santa Ana Educators Assn. , which represents 2 # 000 members . &quot; I hope Californians wake_up and vote ' no. ' &quot; But even if Proposition 187 passes , it will have to overcome major legal obstacles before it ever becomes state law . In a 1982 ruling , the U.S. Supreme Court held that every child , regardless of citizenship , is entitled to a free public education . For Proposition 187 to be implemented , the high_court would have to reverse that decision . Orange County public_school officials say implementing Proposition 187 would be an administrative nightmare . By Jan . 1 , 1995 , schools would be required to begin verifying the citizenship of students enrolling for the first time . By Jan . 1 , 1996 , all students and their parents would have to be checked . At Santa Ana Unified , Orange County ' s largest school district , that would entail determining the legal_status of nearly 50 # 000 children in kindergarten through 12th grade . In Los Angeles , the task would be even more daunting . There are 640 # 000 children in the Los Angeles Unified School District alone . The initiative does not specify how officials are to determine citizenship , stating only that they should exclude anyone whom they &quot; reasonably suspect &quot; of being an illegal immigrant . &quot; How are we supposed to verify citizenship ? &quot; asks Hall-Kessler , who has taught elementary_school in Santa Ana for 20 years . &quot; The only thing teachers can tell you is how many fluent English speakers are in their class . But that doesn ' t tell you anything . There are people born in Santa Ana who don ' t speak a word of English . &quot; And what do they think is going_to become of all these kids turned_out of the schools ? &quot; Hall-Kessler added . Statewide , an estimated 500 # 000 of the 5.3 million children in grades K-12 are illegal immigrants , according to the INS . The state Senate ' s Office of Research puts the figure at 400 # 000 , and the initiative ' s authors say it is closer to 300 # 000 . The initiative would exclude all_of them from public_school , for a savings , of $ 1.2 billion , backers argue . Other supporters speculate that if the measure passes and is implemented , children already in the school_system might be allowed to remain in the schools , but newcomers would be screened_out and excluded . &quot; Right now , any kid who is 5 can get a 12-year education for free , just by getting_over here , &quot; says Harold Ezell , chairman of Americans Against Illegal Immigration and a former western regional commissioner for the INS . &quot; We can ' t afford it , and it ' s not fair. &quot; Garcia , however , is angered by depictions of immigrants as a drain on the economy . She says she and her husband work hard to earn a living for their family . Although they are not legal residents , they pay income_tax . The initiative , she said , &quot; is very unjust . We do the most difficult jobs that other people don ' t want to do for the least amount of money. &quot; Immigrants rights groups also note other hardships the initiative could cause . What would happen , they ask , to illegal immigrant parents whose children are U.S. citizens by virtue of having been born here ? Initiative supporters say parents could choose between taking their children with them or leaving them here with a guardian . But opponents say that is not a realistic solution . &quot; The likelihood that these families would leave the country is minimal , &quot; says Rigoberto Rodriguez , vice_president of the board of directors of the Orange County Alliance for Immigrant Rights . &quot; These families already have a life here . They have roots here. &quot; The provision that would prohibit hospitals and clinics from treating illegal immigrants , except in emergencies , would put doctors in a &quot; horrible &quot; ethical and moral position , according to Orange County Medical Assn . President Peter Anderson . &quot; Number_one , I can ' t treat you , and number two , I ' m going_to report you to the INS ? I can ' t imagine , &quot; said Anderson , who is chief of emergency medicine at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical_Center . &quot; They never taught us that in medical school. &quot; Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for MediCal , the medical program for the poor , except to pay_for emergencies or prenatal care . Under Proposition 187 , prenatal care would no longer be covered . Dr. Hugh Stallworth , the county ' s director of public health , fears that the initiative would hinder his efforts to reduce the spread of contagious_diseases . It is largely through the services offered at the county ' s 14 medical clinics that public health officials keep tabs on the overall health of the population , he said . The county offers immunizations , prenatal care and programs to fight sexually transmitted diseases . &quot; With many of the infectious_diseases , they don ' t cause a lot of pain . So people can live and function even if they don ' t feel that great , &quot; Stallworth said . &quot; A lot of people would rather feel a little bit sick rather than risk confrontation with the INS. &quot; However , Stallworth says , contagious_diseases would still be spread . &quot; You can ' t just tell bacteria to stay_away_from those people , &quot; Stallworth . &quot; Bacteria don ' t know any nationality. &quot; But Proposition 187 supporters argue that illegal immigration is itself largely to blame for many of the state ' s public health_problems . &quot; Doctors are saying ' we have to treat people or we ' ll have a resurgence of TB , ' but where do they think it ' s all coming from ? &quot; asks Bill King , a retired border_patrol agent from Mission Viejo who is one of the local backers of the initiative . &quot; I ' ve seen people apprehended coming_over the border with TB , hepatitis , and leprosy. &quot; If the SOS measure passes , some local social_services agencies assert that they will refuse to question their clients or report them to the INS . &quot; We think that we would have to give_up ( public funds ) because we feel it ' s unconscionable to accept anything that would deny children polio vaccine and mothers prenatal care , &quot; says Jean Forbath , a board_member of Share Our Selves , a Costa Mesa nonprofit agency that runs a food_bank and free medical and dental clinics . The organization serves 20 # 000 clients a month , Forbath said . About 85 % of its funding comes from private donations , with the rest from the state and county , she said . Far removed from the rhetoric on both sides , the Garcias remain optimistic that the initiative will fail , despite polls suggesting it may be approved by a two-to-one margin . &quot; In my relationships with people here I have found them to be very compassionate , &quot; Maria Garcia said . &quot; This is just politics , the work of people who want to stay in power. &quot;</TEXT>
