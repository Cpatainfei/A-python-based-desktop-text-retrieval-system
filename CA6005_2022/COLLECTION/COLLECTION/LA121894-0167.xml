   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : SPECIAL REPORT / HOT TIPS ; WHAT ' S COMING , WHEN , AND WHY IT ' S A BIG DEAL ; IMPENDING WINDOWS95 MAY BE YEAR ' S MAIN EVENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may be late for an important date , but Microsoft ' s eagerly awaited Windows95 will nonetheless be the computer_industry ' s main event next year , say the pundits who track the nation ' s silicon glens and valleys . And assuming that Intel can quickly squash its floating-point bug and quash the attendant controversy , 1995 will also be the year of the Pentium microprocessor and its ilk . There will be plenty of other developments in the coming year : Will the Justice_Department buck industry consensus and scuttle the merger of Microsoft and Intuit , the champion of personal finance software ? If not , will the joined companies grab control of the emerging market for on-line transactions , as_many bankers fear ? Will the Microsoft Network on-line service , due along with Windows95 , spell doom for rivals such_as America Online and Prodigy , and bolster what some increasingly view_as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates ' stranglehold on the computer_industry ? Will the PowerPC coalition make_headway against the Microsoft-Intel juggernaut ? Running_through these issues like an out-of-control computer virus is Microsoft . &quot; Yes , Bill Gates will be all_over everything , &quot; said William Bluestein , an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge , Mass . Mostly , Gates wants his easy-to-use Windows95 operating system to be all_over the desktop PCs of home and business users . It promises a user &quot; interface &quot; with pictures of rooms and objects rather than the usual icons and menu bars , and it will come_with easy on-line access in the form of Microsoft Network . Microsoft says Windows95 will be shipped to stores by June , but don ' t be surprised if it ' s late again . Propelled by Windows95 , the Pentium and Pentium-style &quot; clones &quot; from Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix , sales of PCs are expected to show a healthy increase next year as prices for big multimedia_systems tumble to $ 1 # 200 from $ 1 # 800 this year . Projections from Dataquest , a San Jose market research firm , indicate that 1994 will go_down as the year the $ 35-billion PC industry reached a stunning 21.2 % growth_rate . The pace of expansion in 1995 , when sales of 20.5 million PCs are predicted , will be a still respectable 14.5 % , Dataquest said . &quot; Barring something outside the normal electronic sphere , it sure looks_to me like it will be another strong year for everybody , &quot; said Les Crudele , a vice_president with Motorola ' s microprocessor and memory technologies group in Austin , Tex . Richard Shaffer , principal of Technologic Partners , a New York-based consulting firm , said he expects to see reasonably strong industry expansion next year . &quot; A lot depends_on the strength of the economy , which looks pretty good , &quot; he said . In 1994 , the hot commodity was multimedia , as consumers barreled headlong into computing to take_advantage of the entertainment and educational opportunities afforded by souped-up machines with sound and video . Next year , the home market will continue to be a force , and growth will also come from the transition of office systems to the Pentium chip -- though what effect the recent brouhaha over a bug will have_on Pentium sales remains something of a wild card . It will also be a critical year for IBM , whose OS / 2 Warp will either become a true Windows rival or head toward extinction . IBM will also bring_out its first PCs based on the PowerPC architecture developed with Apple . A few clones of the Apple PowerMac may also emerge late in the year . Meanwhile , global commerce should create boundless opportunities . Central and South_America , China and Africa represent vast , untapped markets for computers and telecommunications gear . &quot; People are going_to be selling this stuff in every nook_and_cranny of the world , &quot; said Roger B . McNamee , general partner with Integral Capital Partners , a Menlo Park , Calif. , group that invests in technology companies . &quot; By the end of the year , things will be smoking. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) PCs What : Windows95 When : About midyear Why it ' s important : Latest Microsoft operating system will be prettier , easier to use and much more powerful than Windows . Will quickly become a PC standard .</TEXT>
