   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; MOCA ' S CITY SOFAS : A SITE FOR SITTING ; AUSTRIAN ARTIST FRANZ WEST LINES UP ROWS OF COMFY COUCHES FOR ' TEST ' TO EXPLORE THE SENSE OF PLACE IN AN AUSTERE SCULPTURE PLAZA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 28 sofas lined_up in four diagonal rows of seven on the outdoor sculpture plaza of the Museum of Contemporary Art constitute a simple but vibrant gesture . * &quot; Test , &quot; as the new , brightly colored installation by noted Austrian artist Franz West is appropriately titled , means to evaluate the prospects for an authentically public sense of place . At a time when the very concept of a lively , open and disputatious public world has severely atrophied , the installation also wants to establish a benchmark or criterion for public-ness . With flying colors , &quot; Test &quot; passes . Those colors range from shocking pink , yellow and purple to lively polka_dots and multicolored African prints . Sewn into slipcovers and bolsters , the fabrics were chosen by West ' s collaborator , Gilbert Bretterbauer , during forays_into downtown L.A. ' s booming garment district . They decorate sturdy , high-back sofas constructed from welded rebar and steel mesh . The &quot; Test &quot; sofas are related to an earlier installation titled &quot; Auditorium , &quot; which garnered considerable attention at the most recent installment of the international art extravaganza Documenta , mounted in the German city of Kassel in the summer of 1992 . There , in a courtyard off the city ' s main plaza , a slew of West ' s steel sofas -- this time upholstered with rugs -- became an inevitable gathering spot for the show ' s throngs of visitors . The 47-year-old artist is not yet well-known outside Europe . Last year , he showed sculptures of plaster , papier-mache and gauze in a group show at Rosamund Felsen Gallery , a solo show at Burnett Miller Gallery and in New York at David Zwirner Gallery . At MOCA , &quot; Test &quot; is West ' s first site-specific museum installation in the United States . A merger of materials familiar from heavy-duty urban construction sites and domestic living_rooms suggests the playfully disconcerting nature of the sofa installation . Conventions that divide industrial and domestic , outdoors and indoors , public and private slyly intermingle . The sculpture plaza , which is surrounded by office and apartment towers , a hotel and two wings of the museum , is a formally austere urban space . The formality of the site is acknowledged in the sofas ' structural design , whose durable simplicity recalls that of an ordinary park_bench . West has arranged the sofas in a linear , side-by-side configuration of two double rows . They run diagonally across the plaza , quietly animating the passageway . But these are cushy sofas after all , not park_benches . Their upholstered pads are made of foam_rubber , they ' re long enough to lounge_around on and they even have pillows . Comfortable , the sofas endow this public place with a startlingly casual informality quite alien to the decorum of such locales . People gather , hang_around , loll , chat , eavesdrop . The sculpture plaza is transformed into a cozy urban back yard . The plaza seating isn ' t exactly European in bearing , although a consideration for enhancing the sociality of public places is typical of cities based on a modern European model . ( It definitely isn ' t American in tone. ) West pointedly inserts a domestic motif into a public place , in the process giving an edge to what we mean by private . Private suggests that something is personal , secret or withheld from public view . Often , it also means something is determined by commercial values . In the United States , where the town square has been definitively replaced by the shopping_mall , the dream of a free and open public world has been constrained by relentless privatization . Slip-covered construction materials wittily imply an effort to humanize our shared urban environment . But West ' s installation goes_deeper than simple surface conceits . He ' s purposefully fashioned sofas for a convivial public living_room , in which any and all are recognized as members of a communal family . The location of &quot; Test &quot; on a museum sculpture court is not essential to its artistic success . It would be as physically comfy , conceptually invigorating and just plain sportive in any of the dreary malls or public plazas that are today routinely built . But the museum site is also unusually resonant . A museum , after all , is a public institution that collects art , while West ' s is public art that collects people . His deft reversal illuminates an enlightened role for a cultural venue -- especially these days , when the concept of a functioning public world seems increasingly bereft . * Museum of Contemporary Art , 250 S . Grand Ave. , ( 213 ) 626-6222 , through July 10 .</TEXT>
