   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP E PREVIEW ; REBIRTH OF A NATION ; AFTER 1990 WORLD CUP BAN , MEXICO SEEKS REDEMPTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is nothing subtle about the pressure on the Mexican World Cup team . As the team left Mexico_City for the United States and its quest to reclaim its country ' s soccer pride , Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari addressed the team : &quot; I am sure that you rely_on the confidence that comes from having prepared well and , fundamentally , you count_on the aid and enthusiasm of all Mexican fans. &quot; After the political niceties , Salinas let the team know his expectations : &quot; Take_heart , and onward to victory ! &quot; Easy for him to say . Salinas and the rest of Mexico realize this is the country ' s best chance to re-establish its reputation as a soccer power -- with a new coach and a young and disciplined team . Although this is the 10th time Mexico has played in the World Cup_final , Mexico ' s soccer fans are most eager to erase the memory of sitting home_in 1990 . The Mexican soccer federation was hit with a two-year ban for using over-age players in a youth tournament in 1988 and was not allowed to compete in the last World Cup . This one is for revenge . &quot; We don ' t want to promise anything but our effort and dedication , &quot; Coach Miguel Mejia Baron said . It ' s a typically understated comment from Mejia Baron , who is credited with taking Mexico ' s national team from the category of talented but disappointing to its current status as one of the tournament ' s eight-best teams . Mejia Baron is the architect of Mexico ' s new look , which emphasizes teamwork and organization over the selfish , ball-hogging style formerly favored by Mexican teams . Their look-at-me flair was undeniably appealing , but yielded only sporadic results . Enter Mejia Baron , who left a flourishing dental_practice to take_over the national team after the abrupt departure of Argentine Cesar Luis Menotti in January of 1993 . Mejia Baron had been a player for the powerful Pumas club of Mexico_City through the ' 60s and ' 70s . He brilliantly guided Mexico through World Cup qualifying -- his team was the first to qualify for the finals and won five of its last six qualifying matches . Mejia Baron earned the respect of his players when he supported them in a threatened strike over free_agency in the Mexican professional league last season . Mejia Baron needed the resulting good_will to convince the players to accept the discipline of his system . Mejia Baron was intent_on doing one thing -- driving the Mexican offense forward . His system takes a common 4-4-2 and converts it to a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 on the attack . Swift midfielders make the whole_thing possible as does Mexico ' s most unusual weapon , the keeper / sweeper : Jorge Campos . Menotti was fond of calling Campos &quot; the goalkeeper of the 21st Century &quot; for his penchant for coming well off the line to make saves and then press forward on the attack . His position well in front of the penalty area discourages counterattacks . His confidence as a field player is_well earned . Campos plays as a forward for his club team , Pumas , and in 1989 he led the team in scoring . Last summer when Mexico played the U.S. national team in the Gold Cup_final in Mexico_City , Campos played the first_half in goal and the second as a forward . Campos , who grew_up in Acapulco and had dreams of becoming a professional surfer , is a self-effacing man whose steely presence on the field has a calming effect on his team . While he was in goal , Mexico went 9-2-1 in qualifying and Campos had seven shutouts . &quot; I don ' t feel special , &quot; Campos said . &quot; I just try to not to make a mistake . Nobody is special . We are all_the same on this team. &quot; His ability to control the ball with his feet gives Mexico an added field player , hence the keeper / sweeper description . Like Rene Higuita of Colombia , Campos ' style can also be risky . Although he uses his quickness to recover and get_back , it is inevitable that Campos will give_up a goal while out of position . The approach has its critics , but Mejia Baron is comfortable with Campos ' style . &quot; Football ' s a game of risk and we accept the risk Campos takes , &quot; he said . &quot; He has the backing of his team and the coach. &quot; Old questions about Mexico ' s consistency arose in the months before the World Cup . First came a tie against Bulgaria . An embarrassing 5-1 loss to Switzerland followed in January , and a 4-1 loss to Russia a week later . Critics acknowledged that Mexico had talent but that its players crumpled under pressure and reverted to their old , individualistic habits . That , plus the fact that Mexico ' s smaller players might be manhandled by Group E World Cup opponents -- Italy , Ireland and Norway -- could make things difficult . When the added pressure of being , as some would argue , the second &quot; home &quot; team in the World Cup is factored in , Mexico ' s expectations of reaching the semifinals would seem fanciful . But not if the team can crank_up its offense to the levels of World Cup qualifying . Luis Roberto Alves , known as Zaguinho , equaled the world_record for goals in a full international , scoring seven times against Martinique . In Alves , Mexico might have found a young , more mobile version of the venerable Hugo Sanchez . Born in Mexico_City but raised in Brazil , Alves took his soccer-playing father ' s nickname , Zague , meaning zig-zag . Zaguinho means little Zague . At 18 he joined his father ' s old team , Pumas , and scored the winning goal in his first game . Alves gained attention on the national team during last summer ' s CONCACAF Gold Cup , when he scored 11 goals in five matches . Yet , during the Copa America , Mejia Baron benched Alves in favor of Sanchez . Only when another player was injured was Alves added_to Mexico ' s roster . Alves came_on in the second_half of the opening game against Colombia , replacing Sanchez , and scored . Alves started every game after that . Mexico , performing beyond expectations , lost the final to Argentina . Mejia Baron has convinced Alves to offer midfield support to bolster his system of complex passes that begins from the back . &quot; What we have to do is take the battle to them by playing the ball on the ground , which is what we are best at , &quot; Mejia Baron said recently . &quot; And , of course , keep the ball moving_around , because that ' s the key to beating the European players. &quot; The coach has assembled players who embrace his philosophy of attack . Defensively , Ramon Ramirez is often brought_up to join the attack . Like Campos , Ramirez plays forward for his club team . Ignacio Ambriz and Alberto Garcia Aspe are candidates at midfield . Up front are Luis Garcia -- who plays in Spain for Athletico Madrid -- and the Mexican league ' s top two scorers from last season , Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Salvador .</TEXT>
