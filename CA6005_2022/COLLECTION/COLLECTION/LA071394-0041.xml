   <HEADLINE> LET BOSNIA BE THE STARTING PLACE ; WAY IS OPEN FOR NEW GERMAN RESPONSIBILITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Literally the whole world has united to force us to accept what they want , &quot; Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic complained Tuesday . Let ' s hope he is right . The &quot; whole world &quot; is , effectively , a coalition whose members are the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Russia . The five have called_on the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croat federation to accept a peace plan assigning 49 % of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Serbs and 51 % to the Muslims and Croats . Muslim-Croat acceptance is likely , Serbian acceptance much less so . Momcilo Krajisnik , speaker of the secessionist Bosnian Serb parliament , has said that the Serbs , who now control 70 % of the country , are unwilling to accept a peace map that requires them to give_up so_much . &quot; The strain of economic sanctions , &quot; Krajisnik said on Tuesday , &quot; cannot be compared to the supreme sacrifices we have made in liberating Serbian land. &quot; Krajisnik was alluding to the apparent willingness of Slobodan Milosevic , president of Serbia , to see Serb-held territory within Bosnia sacrificed if , in exchange , the economic sanctions still imposed on his country were to be lifted . With impressive unanimity , the five major_powers threaten that if the Bosnian Serbs reject the peace plan , the arms embargo against Bosnia may be lifted and the U.N. forces may withdraw . The five powers should maintain the economic sanctions against Serbia with comparable unanimity , for Milosevic , by making the Yugoslav dinar convertible with the German mark in a_few months , took a great gamble . Now may be the very worst moment to ease the pressure . Milosevic is , by any measure , a gifted politician , skilled at making and unmaking coalitions and playing_on hopes and fears inside and outside his country . His public coolness to Karadzic may be no more_than a tactical_maneuver , the prelude to later solidarity and further aggression . Before lifting the sanctions , the group of five should demand not just unequivocal acceptance of the peace plan but demonstrated compliance with it and with the cease-fire that was renewed on Tuesday . If and when all that can be achieved , an enlarged U.N. force will still be necessary . Happily , Germany ' s highest_court has now freed Germany to contribute troops to international peacekeeping missions . Having pressed for the early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia , Germany bears some responsibility for the collapse of European collective_security in the former Yugoslavia . On Monday , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said to the visiting President Clinton that Germany &quot; cannot simply sit_back and let others do the work. &quot; Let that work begin in Bosnia .</TEXT>
