   <HEADLINE> TASTE OF TRAVEL : FRANCE : VINTAGE ALSACE ; THROUGH HILLS BLANKETED WITH VINEYARDS , THEY SEARCHED FOR WINE FINDS ALONG THE RHINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We had just pulled over to snap a picture of a centuries-old stone gateway marking the tiny wine village of Wangen , in northeastern France , when Eugene Kratz rolled_out of the brush_on a tractor even more weathered than his tattered cap . Spying our camera he dismounted from his perch , took our arms and led us across the narrow pavement to his modest timbered home overlooking the valley below . He smiled like a proud father at the vineyards blanketing the nearby hills . Wine is the very soul of Alsace , he said in German-accented French , adding , as he patted his broad chest , &quot; I made some of the very best. &quot; Kratz , 82 , then disappeared into his house , retrieving half_a_dozen brightly colored labels for Riesling , Tokay , Gewurztraminer and other wines that were bottled under his name before he retired in 1985 . Over the next few days , touring the entire 75-mile-long Alsatian Route du Vin that borders the Rhine_River , we began to understand the wine heritage of which Kratz is so proud . As a bonus , we discovered that Alsace is home to marvelous food and among the most visually captivating regions in the country . Beginning in the tiny hamlet of Marlenheim , a stone ' s throw from Kratz ' s vegetable_patch and about 15 miles west of Strasbourg , near France ' s border with Germany , we tracked every inch of the regional wine road that wends south from near Strasbourg to Thann . En route , we passed dozens of geranium bedecked homes and busy village squares tucked into the dramatic eastern slopes and valleys of the Vosges mountains . In the distance , beyond the broad plains , the Rhine_River sparkled . Nearly everywhere we looked were fields of vines and cellars where vintners insisted we sit_down to sample a choice wine or two . We spent many_an hour in winstubs -- the homey cafes where locals gather for food , drink and gossip . There we sampled traditional dishes such_as tarte flambee topped with fromage blanc , cream , bacon and onions , and choucroute , a mixture of sausages , ham and bacon heaped like firewood on a bed of sauerkraut . In Strasbourg alone there are several well-known and wonderful winstubs loyal to the region ' s cuisine . Among our picks both for their food and their charm are Maison des Tanneurs , Chez Yvonne and Le Clou . In Colmar we also liked the Maison des Tetes . In these and other places we were happy to learn that Alsatian kitchens are also home to escargots and foie_gras -- for which the region is famous -- and that we could find dishes as delicate as sole meunie re or as hearty as duck a l ' orange . In the few days before our departure from Paris where we live , my wife , Diane , and I studied up a bit on Alsatian wines , leafing through books and brochures . But our real education came at the countless wine caves that line the wine route itself , where free samples ( degustations ) are offered , often along with discount prices on bottles and liberal conversation in French , German and , occasionally , English . At virtually every stop , we were told that Alsatian wines are misunderstood . &quot; There is confusion between our wine and the German Rieslings , which are really very sweet , &quot; complained George Lorenz , 31 , whose family has been making wine in the village of Bergheim for six generations . Alsatian wines can be fruity , but remain quite dry , he explained as we sipped several vintage wines with him in the tasting room of his main warehouse last year at this time . And unlike wine from other regions , which take their names from the place where they are produced ( Bordeaux and Champagne , for example ) , Alsatian wines are named for their grapes . We saw and sampled seven primary varieties along the wine road -- Sylvaner , Pinot Blanc , Muscat , Tokay ( or Pinot Gris ) , Riesling , Gewurztraminer and Pinot Noir . All are white except Pinot Noir . Setting_out early one morning from Strasbourg , we drove west toward the Vosges and began our search for the first leg of the Route du Vin -- not as easy a proposition as we had been lead to believe . Guidebooks insist that the route is_well marked , but it really is not and we found ourselves doubling_back several times over the next few days in search of the proper road . We were glad we had picked_up a wine road map at the tourist office in Strasbourg . It clearly identified each village on the route so that we could watch for signs leading us to our next stop , even when we lost sight of the Route du Vin markers , which were often small and sometimes rather low to the ground . The same or a similar map can be found at tourist offices along the route and at some of the larger hotels . Despite false starts and turns , we traveled almost half the wine route the first day , charmed by vast vineyards stretching up the Vosges slopes and the tiny villages decked_out with planters spilling_over with brilliant geraniums , petunias , daisies and other summer flowers . Having followed the road through the town of Barr and far up the slopes of the Vosges , we stopped for lunch at the Hotel Arnold in Itterswiller , poised on a hillside overlooking the vineyards . There we ordered baeck-hoffa , a heaping crock of lamb , beef and pork on a stew of onions and potatoes , and coq au Riesling , a variation on coq_au_vin simmered in the local white_wine rather than in the Burgundies that are more commonly used ( about $ 55 for two ) . We couldn ' t help but feel inadequate as we struggled with the immense portions while an elderly yet surprisingly svelte couple at a nearby table lapped_up equal amounts in record time . About an hour and several miles later on this brilliantly sunny day , we checked_into the 8-year-old Hotel Le Schoenenbourg in Riquewihr . We were surprised that the hotel was only a_few years old . Still , it was fabulously comfortable , reasonable at about $ 65 a night and perfectly located on the edge of the village . We took a short breather on the wood terrace , sipping cold beers and visiting with the manager ' s dog before heading_off to explore the village itself . The walled hamlet of Riquewihr was miraculously spared devastation during the World_Wars and has carefully maintained its historic identity and guarded its enchanting warren of narrow cobbled lanes , flower bedecked water wells and its charming timbered clock_tower . Still , it appeared to have lost its battle against legions of tourists and merchants hawking trinkets at virtually every corner . But any misgivings we felt about the village were quickly swept_away that night , thanks to the culinary artistry of Francois Kiener , chef of the Auberge Le Schoenenbourg less than 100 yards from our hotel . Kiener -- who clopped from table to table in his clogs and chef ' s habit -- was trained in Burgundy and San Francisco and acknowledged that his was not traditional Alsatian cuisine . For about $ 120 for both of us , we dined graciously on a plate laden with foie_gras sprinkled with fresh tarragon , fennel and other herbs ( heaven ! ) , ravioli with prawns and sea_bass with a tomato and basil confit . With the meal , we sipped a Riesling -- Schoenenbourg , grand cru 1990 , made by the Raymond Berschy family whose office was 100 feet down a narrow road from where we sat in the restaurant . Returning to the wine route the next day we passed_by Riquewihr en route to Kaysersberg , a marvelous village about five towns down tucked up in the valley of the Weiss River . Kaysersberg , which has the distinction of being the birthplace of Nobel Prize-winner Albert Schweitzer , was among the most captivating villages we saw and hasn ' t suffered the onslaught of tourists that afflicted Riquewihr . The river courses through the edge of town , weaving among the timbered homes , a 12th-Century tower overlooks the village from a nearby slope and storks , the symbol of Alsace , have nested in several towers and on rooftops . We lunched leisurely on the outdoor patio of the Lion d ' Or restaurant in the center of town and watched the lanky storks wheel overhead . Leaving history behind , we next headed for Colmar , the business capital of the wine region . With a population of more_than 63 # 000 , Colmar boasts a fine 14th-Century cathedral and several worthy museums , including the Unterlinden , which houses a variety of well-known religious paintings . We settled that afternoon at the hostellerie Le Marechal , located in a quarter of the city known as Petite Venise ( little Venice ) , for its narrow streets and canals . Le Marechal is worth a peek even if you don ' t stay there . It ' s a whimsical conglomeration of four 16th-Century homes that have been joined in recent years into a distinguished hotel overseen by the energetic Madame Ingeborg Bomo , her husband , Gilbert , and her intimidating Great Dane , Ferro . Rooms named after various composers ( ours was Handel , about $ 130 per room ; Wagner was the most expensive at $ 240 ) are elegantly decorated , many have air-conditioning and some have whirlpool tubs for the road-weary traveler . Though we were inclined to eat_at Colmar ' s famous Maison des Tetes -- so named because of the busts and sculptures adorning the facade -- Madame Bomo and an appetizer of carpaccio of lamb and wild mushrooms convinced us to reconsider her dining terrace alongside one of the canals , where we dined well for about $ 140 on the capaccio , frog legs , duck breast and , of course , Riesling . Resuming the wine route the next morning , we visited the stone towers perched on the_hills above Husseren and briefly examined a handful of charming villages before acknowledging that as beautiful as the towns were , we were tiring of quaint hamlets , half-timbered homes and bins of geraniums . What better remedy , we thought , than turning toward the mountains we had skirted for so many days . Having made no reservations for this last night , we relied mostly on serendipity and discovered the jewel of our trip : the Residence Les Violettes in Thierenbach , just up the mountains from Guebwiller , on the wine road . Les Violettes is set_in an exquisite valley with a view from virtually every room of the adjacent forested slopes and the onion-shaped bell_tower of Notre-Dame de Thierenbach . Charmed by our modest room on the second floor ( at an acceptable $ 90 per night ) , we returned downstairs and asked if we were too late for lunch . &quot; We might be able to fix you a little something , &quot; we were told , as we were shown to an enclosed dining terrace . We were stunned by the view and the elegance -- crystal goblets , fine china settings and bursting displays of roses . ( If only we had dressed for the occasion , we thought -- an idea that appeared to be shared by some of the better dressed patrons eyeing us over their desserts. ) Inspired , we launched into a midday meal of veal medallions blanketed with morels and a collection of fish_fillets that included salmon , bass and other delights . With it , we ordered one of the more full-bodied Pinot Noirs , a 1990 from Dorpf &amp; Irion , a vintner from Riquewihr . The bells of the church chimed as if on cue . We hardly noticed the $ 85 bill . Eager to make room for dinner , we asked about the many paths that led into the forest behind the hotel and were shown a map of the terrain with instructions simple enough that even we could follow them . Two hours later , we returned to the outdoor patio set_off a_few yards from the main house , where a young waiter took our orders for afternoon cocktails . Knowing that the next morning we would complete our trip down the remaining few miles of the wine road , we threw caution and our checkbook to the wind . For a stunning ( but well-invested ) $ 180 , we dined on frog legs in garlic and duck breast a l ' orange , followed by an assortment of mousses and ices doused with raspberry sauce . Credit for the feast goes_to Jean Pierre Munsch , the owner , chef and main attraction . Taking a_few minutes away from the kitchen , he walked us to a well-camouflaged garage where he keeps many of his 21 vintage cars . Munsch singled_out a blue 1925 Citroen B12 coupe with leather seats . &quot; My parents had one of those when I was young , &quot; said Munsch , now 64 . &quot; Later , when I saw one , I bought_it and repaired it. &quot; But his favorite : a six-cylinder 1931 Citroen Roadster , painted a sky blue , with deep-water blue detailing and a leather canopy that folds back so passengers can enjoy the open_air . He climbed in , pushed a button , fretted with the choke and vroooooom . &quot; C a marche ! &quot; he exclaimed .
