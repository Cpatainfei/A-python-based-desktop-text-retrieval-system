   <HEADLINE> THE SCHOOL_BOARD ' S FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Regarding Christian ideology and the upcoming South County school_board elections , letter_writer M.S. Smith ( Oct . 16 ) makes two erroneous assumptions that bear correction . First , Smith states , &quot; South Orange County is dominated by conservative Christians , so what ' s wrong with a board of similar values ? &quot; Here ' s what ' s wrong with it . Contrary to Smith ' s contention that an extremist and a conservative are one_and_the_same , informed voters realize that what separates a religious right extremist from a mainstream conservative believer is the extremist ' s belief that our government should enforce scriptural law and the extremist ' s willingness to subvert the democratic process to achieve this goal . The stealth election of two religious extremists to the Saddleback Unified School District board has led to two years of contentious and obstruction-riddled board_meetings . Religious right school_board members have proven to be primarily concerned about advancing their dogmatic religious philosophy at the expense of the students and parents they are elected to represent . that ' s why Associate Pastor George Hooper of Shepherd of the_Hills Church in Mission Viejo also has concerns about the Religious Right ' s involvement in local politics . It ' s obvious Rev . Hooper understands the First_Amendment when he says , &quot; . . . when one theological perspective is claimed as the only true Christian perspective on a political issue , it is demeaning to persons of all faiths. &quot; Second , as a public_school teacher beginning his 23rd year , I have had it up_to my plan book with the insulting charge that our schools are failing and that , as Smith writes , &quot; nothing could be worse than what we have now. &quot; I invite Smith and other doomsayers to check_out the numbers for themselves . By any standard_of_measurement -- standardized achievement tests , the SAT , percentage of students graduated , percentage of students attending colleges and universities after graduation -- Saddleback Valley and Capistrano Unified rank among the top school districts in the United States .
