   <HEADLINE> U.S. FIRM MAY BUILD RUSSIAN NUCLEAR PLANT ; ENERGY : GENERAL ATOMICS AGREES TO DEVELOP A FACILITY THAT WOULD BURN WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A San Diego firm has signed a joint_venture agreement with Russia ' s Ministry of Atomic Energy to develop an advanced nuclear_reactor in Russia that would burn weapons-grade plutonium to produce electricity , the firm announced Friday . The agreement by General Atomics creates the first joint_venture by a U.S. company and Russia to find a private-sector solution to Russia ' s plutonium oversupply problem . That nation is seeking to dispose_of its massive stockpile of plutonium without depriving itself of the electrical_power produced by its nuclear_weapons complex and the many jobs in its nuclear establishment . Privately held General Atomics is aiming for leadership of the world market for commercial nuclear_power -- a moribund industry for the past decade that could be revived with new nuclear_reactor designs , company executives said . &quot; We would be the leader in the design and systems integration of these reactors , &quot; said Walter Simon , General Atomics senior_vice_president . By some estimates , the market for such reactors could reach $ 50 billion to $ 150 billion over the next 20 years . Meanwhile , the Energy_Department announced Friday that an agreement to end Russia ' s current plutonium production was ready for signing by Vice_President Al Gore and Russian Prime_Minister Victor Chernomyrdin . The agreement provides_for study of how to replace the power produced by weapons reactors in Tomsk and Kranoyarsk . General Atomics hopes the study , along with parallel efforts at the Defense_Department , will lead the U.S._government to endorse the General Atomics plan for a new reactor . General Atomics , which employs 1 # 400 people in San Diego and another 1 # 400 at a subsidiary in Germany , has long been in the nuclear business . It has produced 70 reactors , mainly for nuclear research . Unlike any existing commercial or military reactor , the General Atomics design relies_on helium to cool the reactor core and drive a high-speed turbine . It is touted as a major advance in efficiency and safety because the reactor would be self-cooling in an emergency and produce little waste heat . &quot; It is the consensus of experts that this is a meltdown-proof machine , &quot; Simon said . The reactor would burn plutonium pellets encased in graphite or ceramic , which would moderate the nuclear_reaction and prevent a runaway chain_reaction . But the joint_venture faces major financial hurdles . A large portion must be underwritten by the U.S._government , but the Energy_Department has made no commitments . So far , General Atomics has underwritten the effort . General Atomics ' Simon estimates the reactor would cost $ 525 million , cheap by nuclear standards , because of Russia ' s low construction costs . The Energy_Department is still considering whether it favors burning or permanently burying about 50 tons of surplus U.S. plutonium . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary is said to be opposed to burning any plutonium in reactors .</TEXT>
