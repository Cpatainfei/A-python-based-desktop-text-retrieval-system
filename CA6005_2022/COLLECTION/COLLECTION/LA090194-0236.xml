   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS : SPOTLIGHT ON MEXICO ; THE MEXICAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its most open presidential election in 65 years just completed , Mexicans are again focusing_on economic development and attempting to build_on the economic achievements of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . The North_American Free_Trade Agreement thus far has mainly increased U.S. exports to Mexico , but the country still needs further industrial development , in part , to slow migration to the United States . Maquiladoras In cities along the U.S.-Mexico border and elsewhere , foreign manufacturers have built plants that produce parts or assemble goods for shipment back to the foreign company under special trade rules . About half a_million Mexicans are employed in such plants , which attracted 70 % of the foreign investment in the nation in the last 10 years . Tourism Mexico ' s lovely coastlines help a large tourism industry attract more_than 7 million visitors a year , mainly from the United States . About $ 3.4 billion was earned in tourism during 1990 . Agriculture Although Mexico has developed dramatically in recent decades , it remains strongly agrarian . According to the 1990 census , 22 % of the labor_force was employed producing food , a sector that makes_up about 8 % of GNP . Industry The industrial heart of the country is Mexico_City , which accounts_for about half the national manufacturing activity and 45 % of that sector ' s employment . Guadalajara and Monterrey are also major centers . Oil The country is the world ' s fourth largest oil exporter of crude_oil , with proven reserves of more_than 45 billion barrels , primarily in the southeast and in the Gulf_of_Mexico . In 1992 , oil_production averaged 2.67 million barrels a day , about half exported . Sources : Bank of America , World Information Services , Europa Publications , Price Waterhouse</TEXT>
