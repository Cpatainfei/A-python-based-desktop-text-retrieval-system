   <TEXT> SUBDUING CONGRESS : Hillary Rodham Clinton was basking in relief Monday that hostilities with Haiti had been averted at the last moment -- with her husband recalling an invasion force of 82nd Airborne paratroopers who had been en route to the Caribbean when the deal with Haitian military_leaders was struck . . . . In a chance White_House hallway encounter , Mrs . Clinton was asked whether the Haiti &quot; victory &quot; would carry_over into her efforts to get a health_care reform bill through Congress . She noted that time was running_out in the current legislative session , then said wistfully , &quot; I wish I had the 82nd Airborne to send up_to Capitol Hill. &quot; * NO APPEAL : The appointment of former Solicitor_General Kenneth W . Starr to investigate the Whitewater affair apparently will not be challenged after all by Sen . Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) . Levin had argued that Starr , an active Republican , should not have been picked by a special three-judge panel because he was too partisan . . . . But the senator has since decided he won ' t quarrel with the appointment . Instead , he will ask the Senate to amend the law governing independent counsels so that the court must select appointees who have no actual or apparent conflict_of_interest -- on political , personal or financial grounds . * STRATEGIC DELAY : The Pentagon , ever sensitive to the politics of defense spending , has quietly postponed until after the November elections any decisions on its proposal to curtail or cancel 10 major weapons programs . Deputy Defense_Secretary John M . Deutch disclosed the move to the Senate Armed Services Committee after senators whose states house large defense_contractors criticized the Pentagon ' s possible cuts . Deutch also said the cuts would not even be proposed formally until January , when the fiscal 1996 budget is sent to Congress and that some of the cutbacks would n ' t have any real impact until the end of the decade . . . . Military officials have been grumbling since Deutch issued a memo in August ordering them to submit proposals for revising the 10 programs -- and replacing them with less-expensive alternatives . The list included the Army ' s Comanche helicopter ; the Air_Force ' s joint primary aircraft training system and a new precision-guided missile system ; the Navy ' s new attack_submarine and the Marine Corps ' V-22 Osprey helicopter , and an advanced amphibious_assault vehicle . Pentagon officials aren ' t saying how many of the programs actually might be axed . * NOVEL TRUTH : Much has been written_about the array of three-ring notebooks in the office of Ira Magaziner , who played a leading role in designing President Clinton ' s massive and complex health_care reform plan . Those notebooks , the senior presidential adviser has boasted , held &quot; all_the answers &quot; that any skeptic could pose about Clinton ' s 1 # 342-page plan . In retrospect , however , some Washington wags note that another book on Magaziner ' s shelves perhaps more accurately describes the Administration ' s now-stalled quest to overhaul the health_care system : a medical thriller by Robin Cook titled &quot; Fatal Cure. &quot; * WORRIED WHITES : The Central_Intelligence_Agency , responding to concerns over actions taken_to correct under-representation of women and minorities in important posts , has formed a study group to look_at the spy agency ' s &quot; worried white male , &quot; CIA Director R . James Woolsey disclosed at a hearing this week . Rep . Julian C . Dixon ( D-Los Angeles ) wondered if it constituted &quot; a support group. &quot; Woolsey replied , &quot; Not yet. &quot;</TEXT>
