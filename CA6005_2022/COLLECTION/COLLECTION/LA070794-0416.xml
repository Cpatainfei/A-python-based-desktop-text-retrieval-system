   <HEADLINE> BACKGROUND HELPED CALLAHAN SHARPEN HIS SKILLS FOR BLADES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mike Callahan thought his hockey career was over . When he moved from Toronto to Southern California six years ago , Callahan packed his skates and stick away . The way he figured , the Los Angeles Kings had a better chance of reaching the Stanley Cup_final than he did of finding a place to play competitive hockey . Six years later , the Kings with star Wayne Gretzky have a Stanley Cup_final appearance under their belts . And Callahan , a Santa Fe Springs resident , is the leading goal scorer for Los Angeles ' professional roller hockey_team , the Blades . Talk_about your L.A. stories . Callahan is not terrorizing goaltenders on a pair of ice_hockey skates , but his prowess on a pair of in-line skates has put him on the cutting edge of a new sport . He has scored 11 goals and has seven assists for the Blades , which are 6-3 and in third place in Roller Hockey International ' s Pacific Division . &quot; My strength is putting the puck in the net , &quot; said Callahan , a 6-foot , 210-pound forward . &quot; that ' s what the team looks_for me to do , and that ' s what I try to get done. &quot; Roller Hockey International is in its second year . The league has 20 franchises in the United States and four in Canada . The Blades , which play home_games at the Forum , will play a 22-game schedule this season , 16 against division opponents Anaheim , San Jose , San Diego , Oakland and Las Vegas . The top four teams from each of the league ' s four divisions qualify for the playoffs . Each team ' s roster has 12 skaters and two goaltenders . Players in the league earn a minimum of $ 6 # 000 for the season . They can make as much $ 20 # 000 for winning the championship . The size of concrete or synthetic roller-hockey rinks vary , but they are roughly equivalent_to an ice_hockey_rink . Many of the rules are the same , but there are some differences . In ice_hockey , for example , there are three lines marking the ice to dictate off-sides and other violations . In roller hockey there is only a center_line . Ice_hockey is played five-on-five with a goaltender for each team . Roller hockey is played four-on-four with a goaltender . &quot; With only four guys out there , there is a lot of room to maneuver on offense , &quot; Callahan said . &quot; And if you lose your man on defense , you ' re in trouble. &quot; Callahan , who owns a credit consulting_firm in Burbank , has had no trouble adjusting to hockey on wheels since joining the Blades for its inaugural season last year . He has been playing ice_hockey since he was 5 , and ascended through various organized leagues in Canada until a knee injury ended his dream of playing in the National Hockey_League . After marrying and settling in Southern California , Callahan hooked_up_with the California Hawks , a semi-pro ice_hockey team based in Anaheim that competes in the Pacific Southwest Hockey_League . Last year , he was invited to join the Blades for its inaugural season , and scored 17 goals in 11 games . In May , he traveled_to Japan with an RHI all-star team . He scored two goals and had an assist during an exhibition before 7 # 000 fans . &quot; Some guys just have an instinct to find the net , &quot; Blades goaltender Brad Sholl said . &quot; With Mike , no matter what he does or where he goes , he manages to get a goal a game. &quot; Last season , the Blades advanced to the semifinals of the playoffs before the team was eliminated by Anaheim . The league has doubled in size this season , but Callahan said the Blades , which play Sunday at_home against San Diego , are capable of winning the championship . Like many of the players in the RHI , Callahan is thrilled to be a pioneer in what he predicts will become an increasingly popular sport . &quot; Last year , no one knew what to expect , but the sport is catching_on , &quot; Callahan said . &quot; When I first moved here , you ' d never see kids out on the street playing hockey . Now , you see them all_over the place on ( in-line skates ) with hockey_sticks . &quot; Gretzky , the Kings and the ( Anaheim ) Mighty Ducks have a lot to do with that , &quot; Callahan said . &quot; And hopefully , the Blades can help take it to another level. &quot;</TEXT>
