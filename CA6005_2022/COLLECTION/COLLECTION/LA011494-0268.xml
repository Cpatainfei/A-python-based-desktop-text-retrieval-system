   <HEADLINE> STANTON MOBILE_HOME PARK RESIDENTS SEEK RENT CONTROL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 100 angry residents of the city ' s mobile_home parks attended the City_Council meeting this week to demand rent control . Many said they are_on fixed incomes and are in danger of losing their homes . There are about 1 # 200 mobile_homes in the city at 10 mobile_home parks , planning manager Mark D . Lloyd said . Voters narrowly rejected a ballot attempt in 1984 to establish rent control at city mobile_home parks . Residents of the Katella Mobile_Home Park , the city ' s largest , led the protest at the council meeting . They said their rents were improperly raised . City Atty . Thomas W . Allen told the council the rent issue was a private-property matter over which the city has no jurisdiction . But Mayor Sal Sapien said he is concerned about the dispute and asked both parties to work together to resolve it . In a letter to the council , Katella park resident Ginger Jordan said she knew of a family whose rent was raised without the required 60 days ' notice . She also said another family moved_in and then found the monthly rent was $ 50 higher than what they had been told . After presenting her charges to the council , Jordan received loud applause . Park manager Marsha Carter , who attended the meeting , said afterward that new residents are not required to be given 60 days ' notice . She also said she wished that Jordan and other park residents had contacted her before bringing their complaints to the city . &quot; I would have met with them anyway , &quot; Carter said . &quot; They never asked me. &quot; She said rent increases were 4 % in 1993 and 3 % in 1992 and have typically been kept close to cost-of-living increases . Carter pledged to meet with Jordan and other residents . Jordan , at Sapien ' s request , stood_up at the meeting and agreed to talk with Carter about the problems .</TEXT>
