   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO SEEK U.N. OK FOR HAITI ATTACK , OFFICIALS SAY ; CARIBBEAN : ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO LINE_UP AS MANY AS 3 # 000 TROOPS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES FOR INVASION FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has decided to seek a U.N. Security_Council resolution authorizing an invasion of Haiti by a U.S.-led multinational force to topple the military regime , officials said Wednesday . At the same time , the Administration plans to back_up the threat by lining_up units for an invasion force of as_many as 15 # 000 troops -- most of them American , but as_many as 3 # 000 from other countries . U.S. diplomats already have begun seeking commitments from other countries both to support the proposed Security_Council resolution and to offer troops for a &quot; multilateral force , &quot; reporters were told . The aim of the new effort , officials said , is to persuade Haiti ' s military rulers to step_down peacefully rather than risk an invasion this fall . But if Haiti ' s Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras refuses to leave , the U.N. resolution and the multilateral force would make_it easier for President Clinton to order an invasion because he would then have international authority for it . The new U.S. diplomatic effort thus reflects two competing desires on Clinton ' s part : to persuade Cedras that the American threat to invade Haiti is serious but also to ensure that the United States is not left to act alone in any military_action in the island nation . It also reflects what officials have described as an increasing willingness to consider the use of force on the part of U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and some members of the Security_Council , including not only Russia and France but also Argentina and Brazil , Latin_American countries traditionally opposed to U.S. military_action in the Western_Hemisphere . State_Department spokesman David Johnson said the Administration ' s goal is to assemble &quot; a U.N.-sanctioned coalition force with a mandate to establish a secure and stable environment &quot; in Haiti . He said Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff flew to New York on Tuesday and discussed the idea with Boutros-Ghali , who encouraged the U.S.-led effort . Johnson reaffirmed the Administration ' s basic policy of seeking a peaceful end to the impasse in Haiti , where the Security_Council has demanded that the military_leaders who overthrew the nation ' s elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , step_down . &quot; Our strong preference is for this to be resolved by diplomatic means , &quot; he said . But he confirmed that the Administration is moving ahead with plans for multilateral military_action if diplomacy fails to work . Officials refused to say how long it would be before a multinational invasion force is ready . But the diplomatic task of winning a Security_Council resolution would normally require at least two weeks and the job of assembling military_units from several countries longer than that . Earlier this week , American and foreign diplomats in Haiti predicted that no invasion is possible before September because of the time needed to put_together a U.N.-authorized force . U.S. officials have refused to discuss how large a force would be needed to overwhelm the lightly armed Haitian army of about 7 # 000 troops . But Boutros-Ghali , in a report to the Security_Council last week , estimated that 15 # 000 troops would be needed to restore order in Haiti even if Cedras and his supporters left the country peacefully . Johnson and other officials said the Administration is basing its plans on Boutros-Ghali ' s report , which said the initial U.S.-run force of 15 # 000 could gradually give_way to a U.N.-led peacekeeping operation with fewer than 4 # 000 personnel . Administration officials have said they do not expect other countries to contribute large_numbers of troops to the initial invasion force . But if the Security_Council is willing to authorize a largely U.S. force , the need for foreign contingents is viewed_as minimal -- and the task of assembling the force is made easier . Under a likely diplomatic scenario , the United States would circulate as early as this week a proposed Security_Council resolution that would authorize unnamed countries to use &quot; all necessary means &quot; to compel Cedras to step_down . The same phrase was used in the 1990 resolution that authorized the United States and its allies to go_to_war with Iraq to reverse its invasion of neighboring Kuwait . The Gulf War resolution gave Iraq ' s regime a six-week deadline to comply with the United Nations ' demands before allied military_action was authorized . Whether the proposed Haiti resolution will include a similar deadline for Cedras is uncertain . Winning Security_Council approval for such a resolution will be a major test of skill for Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and the Administration ' s other diplomats . In the months before the Gulf War , then-Secretary of State James A . Baker III jetted around the world in a frantic campaign to win support from council_members , including China , with which the United States has prickly relations . Even if Clinton succeeds in winning a strong Security_Council resolution , he is expected to declare that he still retains the option of a unilateral invasion by the United States -- to maximize pressure on the Haitian regime .</TEXT>
