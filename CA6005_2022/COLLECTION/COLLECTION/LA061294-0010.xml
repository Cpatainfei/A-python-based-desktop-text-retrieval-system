   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : A BRAND-NEW BALL_GAME ; WORLD-CLASS SOCCER IN THE U.S. IS A FIRST -- SO IS THE MASS MULTI-LANGUAGE COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a_few weeks this summer , beginning Friday in Chicago ' s Soldier Field and ending July 17 in Pasadena ' s Rose Bowl , 24 nations representing the elite of international soccer will compete in the 15th World Cup . Sports and TV sports coverage in the United States may never be the same . Over the years , the United States has played host to the Olympic Games and to major championships of all kinds , but it has never staged an event quite like this . Soccer played_at the highest level is something American fans have yet to experience in_person . But nine U.S. cities will discover very quickly this summer what passions soccer can arouse . In all , 52 matches will be played , culminating in the championship game at the Rose Bowl in front of a crowd of more_than 91 # 000 and a global television audience that could well encompass half of humankind . Soccer is , after all , the world ' s most popular team sport . The participants include the United States and defending champion Germany , as well as 22 other countries whose national teams survived up_to two years of qualifying competition . A total of 141 nations started down that road ; these are the elite 24 that completed the journey . &quot; Making Soccer History &quot; is the slogan of the tournament and it could well come true . Already , virtually every one of the 3.5 million tickets have been sold ; all 52 matches will be shown on television . ABC Sports is broadcasting 11 of the games , including two of the U.S. first-round matches and the championship final . ESPN will televise the other 41 games , including the other U.S. first-round match , both semifinals and the third-place game . ESPN2 also will carry some games . Twelve-time Emmy winner Jim McKay will be the in-studio anchor for ABC ' s coverage , with Roger Twibell and Al Trautwig handling the play-by-play . Color commentary and analysis will be done_by Rick Davis , a former U.S. national team captain , and Seamus Malin . ESPN will use a dozen commentators and analysts , including several U.S. soccer personalities . Univision , the Spanish-language network , will broadcast all 52 matches , most of them live . Andres Cantor and Norberto Longo will be the commentators . All matches will be shown commercial-free . Commercials will be screened only during the pre-game , halftime and post-game segments , although there will be some small commercial graphics or logos superimposed on-screen during play . An International Broadcast Center in Dallas will coordinate broadcasts for 180 countries . The 1990 World Cup in Italy was watched by a cumulative audience of 26.7 billion . This year , that figure is expected to surpass 31 billion . By contrast , the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona attracted a total 16.6 billion viewers . Germany and Brazil , both three-time World Cup champions , again are favored to win . Italy , another triple winner , will be a serious contender , as will Argentina , which has won the tournament twice before . Other nations that very possibly could reach the Rose Bowl are The Netherlands and Colombia . But surprise is part of the World Cup excitement and 1994 could well be the year of the upset . SOCCER TIPS FOR THE NOVICE VIEWER If you ' ve never watched a soccer game and would n ' t recognize a player if you tripped over him , here ' s an instant guide to help you understand and better enjoy what ' s going_on . The thing to remember is that soccer is a simple game . The 90-minute match is divided into 45-minute halves with no timeouts . There are 11 players on each team and every one of them , in theory , is free to wander anywhere on the field he wants to . Each team is limited to three substitutions . Once a player is taken_off , he cannot return . Use of hands is forbidden , except by the goalkeepers inside their own areas . The referee is in sole charge of the game . The winner is the team that puts the ball in the net most often . There , wasn ' t that simple ? Here , now , is a little more detailed explanation of the four basic player positions and their role , along with some of the stars to watch for during the World Cup . GOALKEEPERS They are the last line_of_defense , the acrobats of soccer who fling themselves about at risk , if not to life , then certainly to limb . They wear gloves and a different-colored jersey to distinguish them from the rest of the players . STARS TO WATCH -- Argentina ' s Sergio Goycochea -- Ireland ' s Pat Bonner -- United States ' Tony Meola -- Italy ' s Gianluca Pagliuca -- Mexico ' s Jorge Campos -- Spain ' s Adoni Zubizaretta -- Germany ' s Bodo Illgner -- Sweden ' s Thomas Ravelli DEFENDERS There are generally at least four of them and they tend to stay back and protect their goal area . Their responsibility is to thwart the opposing attackers by tackling , blocking shots and so on . They are usually physically larger and more aggressive than the other players . STARS TO WATCH -- Italy ' s Franco Baresi -- Germany ' s Lothar Matthaus -- Argentina ' s Oscar Ruggeri -- Mexico ' s Ramon Ramirez -- Norway ' s Rune Bratseth -- Brazil ' s Jorginho -- Ireland ' s Paul McGrath -- The Netherlands ' Ronald Koeman MIDFIELDERS There can be anywhere from two to five of these players , all_of them acting_as linkmen between the defense and offense . Some are primarily defensive ; others are little more_than disguised forwards . The creative midfielders are the so-called &quot; brains &quot; of the team , responsible_for setting_up plays and controlling the action . They function like the hub of a wheel . STARS TO WATCH -- Colombia ' s Carlos Valderrama -- Argentina ' s Diego Maradona -- Germany ' s Andreas Moller -- United States ' Tab Ramos -- The Netherlands ' Frank Rijkaard -- Belgium ' s Enzo Scifo -- Bolivia ' s Erwin ( Platini ) Sanchez -- Romania ' s Gheorghe Hagi FORWARDS Also known as strikers . There can be one , two or three of them . Their duty is to finish what the midfielders create . They must put the ball in the net . Nothing else matters . Usually , they are the fastest players on the field , the most dangerous and the highest paid . STARS TO WATCH -- Italy ' s Roberto Baggio -- Germany ' s Jurgen Klinsmann -- Argentina ' s Gabriel Batistuta -- The Netherlands ' Dennis Bergkamp -- Brazil ' s Romario and Bebeto -- Bulgaria ' s Hristo Stoichkov -- Colombia ' s Faustino Asprilla -- Nigeria ' s Rachidi Yekini</TEXT>
