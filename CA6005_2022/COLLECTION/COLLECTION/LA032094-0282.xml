   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR ' S BIG OSCARS ISSUE ; WHO ' D KNOW BETTER ABOUT THE CREAM OF 1993 ' S ACTING CROP ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> T alent has never been the sole criterion in the Oscar race . Awards have been granted to sentimental favorites such_as John Wayne for 1969 ' s &quot; True Grit &quot; as well as_to industry stalwarts whose body_of_work warranted an award -- even if their nominated performances might not . ( Think Elizabeth Taylor in &quot; Butterfield 8 &quot; or Paul Newman in &quot; The Color of Money. &quot; ) In anticipation of Monday ' s Oscar ceremony , however , The Times asked three prominent acting coaches -- Howard Fine , Janet Alhanti and Larry Moss -- to size_up the best actor and actress and best supporting actor and actress categories solely on the basis of the performances . Here are their responses : Best Actress ANGELA BASSETT ( &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; ) Fine : It ' s very difficult to play someone alive and known -- especially someone as raw and passionate as Tina Turner . Bassett made Turner her own not through imitation but by finding those parts of the character inside herself . The major mistake the filmmakers made was showing Turner herself at the end , which reminded us of the differences . Moss : Bassett was a great choice for the role . She has an aliveness as a person , a larger-than-life quality , which rivals the passion of Tina Turner . From the outset , she creates the feeling that her character is pulsating , ready for picking like a big , ripe tomato . She combined great tenderness and vulnerability with a ( expletive ) quality . STOCKARD CHANNING ( &quot; Six Degrees of Separation &quot; ) Fine : The easy choice would have been to &quot; label &quot; the role , to create a superficial one-dimensional East_Side socialite . Channing instead gave us a restless spirit , a woman searching for passion and trapped by comfort . Alhanti : Whenever anyone asks me where the intelligent , witty , sophisticated , vulnerable actresses of the ' 30s and ' 40s are , I point to Channing . She ' s about the only actress working now that has all_of those qualities -- and this part tapped all_of it . Instead of playing the character like a cliche -- a brittle , dislikable society woman -- she gave us someone fighting for her life . This is the best role yet for her on the big screen . HOLLY HUNTER ( &quot; The Piano &quot; ) Fine : One of the first things some actors do is underline the number of lines they have in a script . The more words , they believe , the better the role . In this case , however , Hunter had to communicate without dialogue . Through her eyes and body , she had to make us feel her soul . Hunter has an &quot; animal &quot; essence -- you never know what she ' ll do next . Alhanti : Hunter ' s performance was stark , grim , very pilgrim and gothic , and never really made me care about the character . I didn ' t worry about her , because she was so strong and willful . She was childlike with her daughter , removed from her husband , even wary of her lover . When she finally gave_in to him I breathed a sigh of relief -- it was like letting air in the room . I also never felt her passion for the piano , which was her history , her voice , her womanhood . When she touched those keys , we should have been taken_to another place . I wasn ' t . Moss : Hunter is not a great beauty , but her fierce commitment to what she does makes her very charismatic . This was a brave performance , completely self-absorbed . She wasn ' t afraid of the narcissism of the character , which was a survival technique in a situation beyond her control . I felt Hunter ' s excitement playing the role . Like Shirley MacLaine in &quot; Terms of Endearment , &quot; she knew she was made_for it . EMMA THOMPSON ( &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; ) Fine : Thompson combines the best of the_British vocal school and American emotional gutsiness . Because she ' s as strong as ( Anthony ) Hopkins , so evenly matched , it ' s a pleasure to watch the two on screen . Thompson ' s strength is playing high-moral-fiber characters with complexity . Alhanti : It took a real piece of acting to play a part this restrictive , since Thompson is such a free_spirit . She does performance art . She breathed life into the movie for me and put her own stamp -- that forthright , chin-up approach to the world -- on the part . DEBRA WINGER ( &quot; Shadowlands &quot; ) Alhanti : Winger , herself , is down to earth and unguarded , so there was good marriage between actor and character . My only criticism is that she should have played it more polished instead of with a brashness and an offensiveness that turned people off . Not everyone from the_Bronx talks that way . Moss : Winger faced the considerable challenge of juxtaposing the &quot; bull in a china shop &quot; syndrome -- not caring what people think -- with someone insecure in her value as a poet and a woman . She brought it off beautifully without a trace of sentiment . . . which helped . People don ' t know what to make of Winger , but she knows what she ' s about . Best Actor DANIEL DAY-LEWIS ( &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ) Fine : Played by an inexperienced actor , this character could have been just one thing : an angry guy . But Day-Lewis draws from a caldron of emotions and is so fluid you never know what he ' ll do from moment to moment . Alhanti : If a character is a canvas , some actors stay in the corner , some go_over the top and fall_off , while others , such_as Day-Lewis , paint the entire canvas . Still , I ' ve never seen him cut loose like this . He had to go from a naive , petty thief to a decked-out hippie to a terrified victim to a passionate resistance fighter so , in_effect , was playing four different roles . Moss : Day-Lewis wasn ' t afraid to be cruel in those scenes in prison with his father . He , like Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken , isn ' t one of those actors who need to be loved . If you don ' t like his edge , he suggests , it ' s your problem , not his . LAURENCE FISHBURNE ( &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; ) Fine : The easy trap would have been to play Ike Turner like a villain and to distance himself from Ike ' s essence . Most actors don ' t want to acknowledge that part of themselves . But Fishburne shows us the motor for the behavior . He creates a man unable to cope_with success -- his or Tina ' s . Alhanti : This is a breakthrough vehicle for Fishburne , the most that has been demanded from him as a leading man . Little by little , he keeps exposing more : the violence , the cunning , the need to control . Moss : This movie came_out early in the summer , but Fishburne ' s performance is so indelible you can ' t forget it . He played Ike like a great casting agent , someone who saw Tina as his ticket to success and never tried to pastel or dilute his vicious behavior . Like De Niro in &quot; Raging Bull , &quot; he tapped into the terror of being unconscious of oneself -- and this performance was every bit the equal of that one . TOM HANKS ( &quot; Philadelphia &quot; ) Fine : This isn ' t the tour_de_force Hanks is capable of , because the script doesn ' t permit it . Denzel Washington , more_than Hanks , is given a character with the kind of growth necessary for an audience to stand_up and cheer . Still , Hanks did a wonderful job with what he was given . He creates an immediate likability and empathy and evidences a real vulnerability without falling_into the trap of playing stereotypically &quot; gay. &quot; Alhanti : As an actor and as a character , Hanks projects the sense that he ' s on the side of right . He ' s one of those rare human_beings who have all 52 cards in his deck , and in this case he pulls all_of them out . He broke new ground with this role . That scene in which he danced to a Maria Callas aria was painful , glorious and brave . Moss : I loved Hanks ' wryness and humor , but the strongest part of his performance was his use of physicality . He used himself in a gentle and loving way , conveying a delicacy and sweetness that had nothing to do with cliches . ANTHONY HOPKINS ( &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; ) Fine : This isn ' t a flashy role . An inexperienced actor would have just seen its limitations , but Hopkins plays the character more as a man longing to express himself rather than someone unable to feel . Many actors just want to play the hero , but he picks the scabs and lets the pus run_out . Alhanti : Hopkins was better in &quot; Shadowlands. &quot; In this film , he plays a gentleman ' s gentleman , someone who doesn ' t permit himself the luxury of emotion , and to me , that reserve and stoicism was a little frustrating and overbearing . Though Hopkins is an exquisite actor , someone who realizes the value of doing less , I felt the part controlled him . LIAM NEESON ( &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; ) Fine : It ' s easier to play black_and_white , but Neeson paints Schindler in shades of gray , an Everyman with all his faults who rises to the occasion . We see the building_blocks -- the emotional changes -- as the atrocities occur so that last scene , in which he addresses his workers , doesn ' t come from nowhere . Neeson ' s physical stature works to his advantage , but it ' s his comfort in his own body that gives him the necessary power and bearing . Alhanti : Neeson played Schindler like a super-salesman adept at taking_advantage of any situation . Though by far his most stylized part to date , it was also very subtle . You never sensed any arrogance or the fact that he saw himself as a savior . If a role is like an onion , Neeson did a magnificent job of peeling_off the layers . Moss : The strength of Neeson ' s body was a metaphor for his inner force . You had the feeling he could protect the Jews just by his mass . With subject_matter that devastating , you need a charismatic character to be your guide . Supporting Actress HOLLY HUNTER ( &quot; The Firm &quot; ) Fine : Just as Emma Thompson is so good at making ordinary characters extraordinary , Hunter excels at making outrageous characters believable . Despite her sassiness and strength , this is not a super-woman doing extraordinary things but someone who , like any of us would be , is scared to death taking those risks . Alhanti : No one can play Southern and gutsy , a little coarse , like Hunter can . Hunter is great at comedy , which is the hardest thing to do . It ' s all about timing . . . and some people are tone-deaf . Moss : Hunter was excellent at bringing a slovenly , low-rent sexuality to the part , but this role was a good one , not a great one . The fact that she was nominated when Gene Hackman , who stole the movie , wasn ' t , testifies to how few good_parts there are for women . ANNA PAQUIN ( &quot; The Piano &quot; ) Fine : It ' s refreshing to see a child actress without a case of &quot; The Cutes. &quot; Paquin truly has an old soul . She was also sensitively directed . Instead of playing_on our natural sympathy for children , we ' re allowed to hate her , at times . This is as complete a performance as that given by any of the adults in the film . Alhanti : Paquin was the light in this very dark film . Though she had to be her mother ' s voice , the conduit of communication , she never came_across bratty . Moss : A devilish performance in which Paquin had to walk a tightrope -- playing a mother to her mother and , at_the_same_time , utterly lost . It was an extraordinary performance , almost scary . ROSIE PEREZ ( &quot; Fearless &quot; ) Fine : Perez is an actress with wonderful emotional facility but hampered by her voice production . Emotions have to flow_from ease , and her jaw is always tense . She ' s obviously got the goods , but it ' s grating to listen to her . Moss : Perez brought_to the role a wonderful , sad bewilderment I haven ' t seen in her before . Instead of the tough-talking , got-it-all-together , sexy , impenetrable ladies she usually plays , we ' re given a woman up for grabs with no definition or walls , a woman whose life has been busted open and who doesn ' t know if it will come_back together again . WINONA RYDER ( &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; ) Fine : With the exception of Michelle Pfeiffer , I don ' t think any of the actors in this movie had real blood flowing through their veins . ( Director Martin ) Scorsese played externals -- dishes and scenery -- at the expense of relationships and human behavior . Who wants to watch frosting on a cake ? Alhanti : I regarded this character as a piece of porcelain -- beautiful , pristine and a little removed . Not until the end of the film did I see a full-blown woman emerge . It ' s hard to know whether the problem lies_with the direction , the script or her interpretation of the part . Moss : Ryder plays this part like an iron butterfly -- wily , manipulative , steel-willed . She has a gentle , soft-voiced femininity with a certain meanness underneath . I haven ' t seen her this brilliant in anything else . EMMA THOMPSON ( &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ) Alhanti : This was a very passionate role , and Thompson filled it . She manages to convey a sense of self without ego or arrogance . This is no &quot; best supporting &quot; role , though . If an unknown was cast , I ' m sure she would never have been nominated . Still , it took courage for Thompson to play this part , which caused her real problems in England . Moss : This is a limited role , but Thompson ' s intensity of commitment , her railing and outrage made_it a pivotal one . Her passion -- almost to_the_point of hysteria -- in that last scene helped the film reach a climax . Supporting Actor LEONARDO DiCAPRIO ( &quot; What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape ? &quot; ) Fine : The role of a mentally challenged young_man poses a minefield of problems for an actor . If you don ' t research it adequately , you could base it on your idea of the character instead of on truthful behavior and end_up dead in the water . DiCaprio threw himself into the role headfirst without self-consciousness or going_over the top . He ' s the lifeblood of the film . Alhanti : I worked with handicapped children , and after seeing the film , it was hard for me to believe that DiCaprio wasn ' t retarded . Many actors would have fallen_into the trap of playing the externals , but DiCaprio is a real student of human behavior . He showed the playfulness , the impatience , that typifies a person with problems like these . RALPH FIENNES ( &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; ) Fine : What I love about Fiennes ' performance is that he creates a &quot; body center &quot; in his stomach . He makes his body a fortress through which he hides and protects himself . He ' s both sexual and repulsive at_the_same_time . Though his character commits heinous acts , he shows us his insecurity . You hate him , but you understand him , which makes his behavior all_the more frightening . Alhanti : This was a very clean , precise performance . Fiennes let nothing get_in his way . Many actors tend to put too_much icing on the cake , but he didn ' t do anything not demanded of him . He played a man who was both tortured and a torturer , which is very hard to convey . Moss : Fiennes played the character like an adolescent butcher -- wild , demented , sensual , desperate , lost , childlike and very charismatic . He was oddly touching , which made him more terrifying . TOMMY LEE JONES ( &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ) Fine : Jones did a great job of humanizing a quintessential hard-ass . We see someone who , like Harrison Ford ' s character , is strong-willed , ethical , good at what he does -- and capable of growth . And because Jones &quot; owns &quot; every aspect of himself to an unusual degree -- there are never any apologies -- he always commands our attention . Moss : One of the things that made Jones ' performance extraordinary was his relationship to the men with whom he worked -- his sense_of_humor and affection when dealing with them . This , we saw , was a real living man instead of a cliche -- a blue-collar Everyman with no nuance . Though we hated his actions , we liked the man , which helped to keep the stakes high . JOHN MALKOVICH ( &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; ) Fine : A lesser actor would have treated the part as the nemesis or enemy of Clint Eastwood ' s character , but Malkovich ' s brilliance is that he treats him as a colleague or an intimate -- almost his other half . This is no stereotypical bad_guy , like the ones in James Bond . The line between hero and villain is blurred . Moss : Few people play rage and evil as well as Malkovich . He demands that you be fascinated by him . While you sense his excitement at outfoxing his opponents , you feel the pain behind his twisted ego . Malkovich is integral to the success of the film , which is essentially a love_story between his character and Eastwood ' s . PETE POSTLETHWAITE ( &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; ) Fine : Many actors would have played this character as a spineless victim unable to express himself , but Postlethwaite played the &quot; positive &quot; -- a man who lives cleanly , plays by the rules and is betrayed by the system that he respects . that ' s the true tragedy . We ' re given a limited man trying to maintain his dignity , someone who may have a different set of priorities than we but not someone we ' re likely to dismiss . Alhanti : A wonderful piece_of_work portraying someone who ' s both helpless and heroic . Instead of playing the character like a victim who was submissive and weak , Postlethwaite conveyed the graciousness in the man . The role requires great subtlety but carried the plot .</TEXT>
