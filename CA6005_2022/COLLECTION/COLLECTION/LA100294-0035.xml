   <HEADLINE> LA DOLCE VITA ; STUNNING GELATO AND MODERATE PRICES MAKE ALTO PALATO A SWEET DEAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Italian , to say someone has alto palato -- literally , &quot; high palate &quot; -- is to say that they have impeccable taste . It ' s an expression that could easily describe Mauro Vicenti , the demanding , Roman-born owner of Rex il Ristorante in Downtown Los Angeles , who has given that name to the new West Hollywood restaurant he owns with Danilo Terribili . Actually , it ' s more born-again than brand new , occupying the site of Vicenti ' s old restaurant Pazzia , which he closed_in January . It looks very much like Pazzia -- the same large-scale space , sleek , tapestry-covered chairs and abstract paintings as big as rugs . A few of the waiters are familiar too . But where Pazzia was elegant , formal , expensive , Alto Palato is casual , friendly in feeling and moderate in price . It ' s a good neighborhood trattoria that , instead of taking_up a little storefront , occupies this rather grand room . The partners also added_on a soaring space that fronts La Cienega , where they have installed a bar , gelato display and wood-burning pizza oven , giving Alto Palato entree to a lively new late-night scene along La Cienega . The pizzas , thin-crusted and blistered at the edges , are very Italian , spare by California standards . One has a thin veil of melted mozzarella overlaid with pungent , peppery arugula and silky slices of prosciutto ribboned with fat ; another delicious version is topped with potatoes , rosemary and caramelized onions . One night in the outdoor courtyard , decorated with potted lemon_trees , I watched a large table of young Italians put_away pizza after pizza , folding the slices in half , talking , smoking and , finally , polishing off their informal meal with house-made gelato -- and , of course , tiny cups of espresso . Alto Palato is still a restaurant in_progress , and its menu of salads , soups , simple pastas , fish specials and grilled meats has its ups and downs . You can count_on a decent and varied antipasto plate that has a miniature caprese of tomato , basil and mozzarella , a little bresaola ( air-dried beef ) , salami and prosciutto , and fig and melon , all for $ 7 . A lemon-drenched seafood salad is , depending_on the day , a mix of tender squid , shrimp , scallops and octopus . I like the polpette , meatballs in a simple tomato_sauce , better than the suppli , fried_rice balls . Soups are rustic and filling : there ' s an earthy chickpea soup infused with fresh rosemary , or pappa al pomodoro , a porridge-like Tuscan soup of bread , tomatoes and basil -- very much an acquired taste . Pastas are just as un-fancy : wide pappardelle noodles tossed with a meaty ragu laced with mushrooms and peas , and rigatoni all ' amatriciana , made with Roma tomatoes , pancetta and sharp Romano . You can order your spaghetti tossed with sauteed zucchini weighed_down with cheese , or with ricotta seasoned with lots of lemon_peel , pungent nutmeg and black_pepper -- another acquired taste . To get prices down without compromising on the quality of the ingredients , the owners have excluded high-ticket items like lobster , scampi , duck and game_birds . But they still use good tomatoes , prosciutto , cheese and produce . ( Salad_greens , however , could be a little less ragged. ) Something like the economical rollata di vitello , a roll of veal stuffed with spinach greens , mortadella and frittata , is more interesting than a piece of grilled meat any day . Spezzatino tastes just like what it is , a veal stew , cooked forever , until the meat is soft as old rags . The grilled prime rib is just OK -- for $ 11.95 a person ( for two ) , it ' s not a big surprise . However , the special veal chop offered one night , roasted with rosemary and served in its juices , was remarkable for its deep flavor and tenderness , the best veal chop I ' ve had in town . Searching the uninspired two-page list for an interesting Italian wine to accompany the food is something of a chore . The best you can hope for is Antinori ' s ' 93 Orvieto ( $ 16 ) or ' 89 Chianti Classico Riserva ( $ 28 ) , a ' 92 Bolla Chardonnay ( $ 17 ) or a ' 91 Plozner Merlot ( $ 18 ) . A glass table in the center of the room holds the dessert assortment : an apricot crostata , a traditional open-face fruit tart with a thick , cookie-like crust ; a fine-textured chocolate_cake made with bread crumbs , apples and amaretto ; a rather dry ricotta cheesecake , and straightforward creme_caramel . Given the choice , I ' d pass_up all these sweets for the gelato every time . One of the waiters , Gino Rindone from Turin , makes the absolutely first-rate gelato . The best is the hazelnut , made from fragrant nuts from Piedmont . His chocolate is deep and dark , while fior di latte , produced with eggs and cream ( no vanilla ) , shows_off the pure taste of cream . Sometimes he offers refreshing Sicilian granita di limone ( lemon ice ) and one of summer ' s greatest pleasures , granita di caffe , a rough slush of espresso ice crowned with loosely whipped cream . He also creates perfect espresso and cappuccino , topped with foam soft as clouds . That alone makes Alto Palato worth a visit . Alto Palato , 755 N . La Cienega Blvd. , West Hollywood ; ( 310 ) 657-9271 . Closed Sundays . Bar open until 1:30 a.m. serving pizzas , sandwiches , appetizers and desserts . Dinner for two , food only , $ 30 to $ 60 . Corkage $ 10 .</TEXT>
