   <HEADLINE> GROUP PROTESTS RESTAURANT ' S ' WILD ANIMAL ' MENU SPECIALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To chef Leo Holczer at the Aurora Restaurant , the alligator is a delicacy that ' s best served braised with a slightly spicy tomato_sauce on a bed of spaghetti . To members of Orange County People for Animals , the alligator is an endangered species that should remain off any restaurant ' s list of specialties . Protesting what they consider the illegal commercialization of wild animals , about 25 members of the animal-rights group picketed Holczer ' s restaurant Tuesday , demanding that he remove such exotic dishes as &quot; alligator pasta , &quot; &quot; grilled kangaroo chop , &quot; &quot; elk loin with wild berries , &quot; and &quot; lion roast &quot; from his pricey and ever-changing menu . &quot; We ' re concerned that the restaurant is selling bodies of the kangaroo , antelope and alligator , which are all listed as endangered species under the California Penal Code , &quot; said Ava Park , founder of the 2 # 000-member animal rights group . &quot; We feel that there ' s plenty of animals to eat without including wild animals . Wild animals are a symbol of freedom. &quot; Holczer , standing in front of the restaurant wearing a white chef ' s hat and jacket , disputed assertions that he has violated the law , saying he buys his meat from companies that are licensed to breed animals for commercial purposes . &quot; It ' s all managed through an efficient game system , &quot; said the Swiss-born and trained chef , who has owned the restaurant on Euclid Avenue for 13 years . &quot; Plus , as long as man has been_on this Earth , we ' ve eaten meat . The Bible says this is the way we eat. &quot; Although the state does prohibit the selling of alligators , antelopes , kangaroos and a number of other endangered species , it tends to prosecute cases only if the animal is_on the federal list of endangered species , said Jack Edwards , deputy chief of law_enforcement at the state_Department of Fish and Game in Sacramento . &quot; For example , the feds now allow the commercialization of most types of alligators , kangaroos and antelopes , &quot; Edwards said . &quot; Even though it ' s technically illegal in California , if we write a violation , no district_attorney would file a case because we ' ve lost so many cases in the past. &quot; The animal-rights activists , however , say they are hardly satisfied with the state ' s response to the issue . &quot; As far as we ' re concerned , the law is the law , &quot; said Park , who became an animal-rights activist after she visited a university research lab in 1982 and said she saw cats being tortured as part of an experiment . &quot; And we will go_to the ends of the Earth to see that it is enforced. &quot; Meanwhile , Holczer plans to continue to serve_up such entrees as alligator meat , which he describes in his menu as the &quot; chef ' s specialty. &quot; Although alligator and elk are standard entrees at the restaurant , Holczer offers other exotic meats only as they become available . &quot; I don ' t know why they ' re protesting , because we ' re not doing anything illegal , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just meat , and it ' s available. &quot; While the animal-rights protesters waved signs reading , &quot; Orange County says no to lion dinners , &quot; and &quot; Leave wild animals alone , &quot; customers continued to arrive_at the restaurant . &quot; These protesters don ' t have the foggiest idea what they ' re doing , &quot; said Bob Snow , a Fullerton resident who has dined at the restaurant for 12 years . &quot; It ' s illegal to sell hunted wildlife , but all_of these animals are ranch-raised. &quot; Said fellow diner Earl Salter of Fullerton : &quot; The food here is no different than what you eat_at McDonald ' s . This is not stuff that had been running_around wild . I ' m constantly bringing clients here , and I know they ' ll have a great meal and that they won ' t be disappointed. &quot; Although the Aurora Restaurant serves fish , beef and other conventional entrees , Holczer said it has built its reputation on its more exotic offerings . Every year , the restaurant holds a three-day_event called &quot; Festival of the Hunt , &quot; at which patrons can sample such dishes as &quot; ostrich with cognac plum_sauce &quot; and &quot; moose loin. &quot; &quot; I was horrified when I found_out he was selling these exotic animals , &quot; said Hannah Ryan , communications director of the animal-rights group . &quot; I think he puts it on the menu just for novelty reasons. &quot;</TEXT>
