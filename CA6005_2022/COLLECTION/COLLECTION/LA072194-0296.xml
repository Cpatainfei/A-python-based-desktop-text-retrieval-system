   <HEADLINE> GERMANS MARK GLIMMER OF NAZI RESISTANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the stone courtyard of the Nazi army headquarters where four officers were executed after a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler , the German government on Wednesday celebrated the one day in a year of World_War_II anniversaries in which this country could take_pride . This was to be nothing less than reunified Germany ' s &quot; Shining Day , &quot; as the Berliner Morgenpost called the 50th anniversary of July 20 , 1944 , when a young colonel of the General_Staff , Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg , placed a bomb in Hitler ' s East Prussian headquarters that injured the Fuehrer but failed to kill him . Chancellor Helmut Kohl , excluded from last month ' s Allied D-day ceremonies , personally led the nationally televised commemoration of the &quot; other Germany &quot; -- the courageous individuals who actively opposed Nazi tyranny . &quot; July 20th became the epitome of German resistance against National_Socialist barbarism , &quot; Kohl said solemnly . &quot; The men and women of July 20th helped us Germans to find our way back into the community of free_peoples soon after the war. &quot; Yet , as usual when Germany addresses its tortured history head-on , the shine was off the day long before sunrise , as controversy and passionate polemics overshadowed the celebration . Kohl was accused of exploiting the occasion for his reelection campaign by giving the commemorative speech himself -- instead of allowing the president to do so as on the 40th anniversary -- and by excluding the opposition Social Democrats , who were among those most persecuted by Hitler , along with Jews , Gypsies and Communists . At the same time , on television and in the national press , the country engaged in an intense debate over who should be considered the rightful heirs of German resistance : Could conservative officers be heroes if they had initially supported Hitler ' s Nazism and did not turn against him until the war was all but lost ? What about the Communist opposition -- why should it be included among the honorable resistance if members fought from the safety of exile and turned_out to be Stalinists ? Each side accused the other ' s resistance fighters of having been undemocratic and , therefore , ineligible for hero status . And , meanwhile , there was one sad , indisputable fact underlying this occasion : The resistance had been minute . There was no mass movement against Hitler . Rather , most Germans supported the Nazis or at least went_along with them . Few had the will or courage to fight ; those who did were ineffectual . The &quot; other Germany &quot; is perhaps best illustrated in a sepia-toned photograph at the German Resistance Memorial Center in the old army headquarters . The photo shows row after row of shipyard workers in 1936 with arms raised in a Nazi salute ; hidden among them is a lone soul whose arms are folded across his chest in defiance . To the government ' s credit , the photograph leads its traveling exhibition titled &quot; Against Hitler : German Resistance to National_Socialism , 1933-1945 , &quot; which opened this week at the Library of Congress in Washington . The exhibit will move to Los Angeles in October . &quot; We are not trying to exonerate Germany or to say we were a_people of resistance , &quot; said Ekkehard Klausa , who oversees the memorial for the state of Berlin . &quot; Certainly we were not . But you have to see both sides . July 20th is a symbol of the other Germany . . . . Tens of thousands of people went_to concentration_camps early on ( for their opposition ) , were driven into exile or were members of the resistance. &quot; The center ' s permanent exhibit includes the range of opposition : conservatives and Communists , Protestants and Catholics . Most controversial among rightists is an exhibit on the resistance-in-exile . It includes two photographs of the former East_German Stalinist leaders Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht . But the memorial primarily emphasizes the July 20th attack , which Klausa says was the most important single act of resistance , although those officers also represented a minority . Out of 2 # 000 generals , only 22 were certainly involved in the resistance . On July 20 , Stauffenberg , 36 , who had lost an eye and his right_hand on the Russian front , planted a briefcase full of explosives in Hitler ' s &quot; Wolf ' s Lair &quot; headquarters , where the Fuehrer and officers were gathered for a military briefing . Stauffenberg had time to activate only half of the explosives he brought with him ; the bag was pushed under a solid oak table that protected Hitler from the blast . Four people died and the room was destroyed , but Hitler lived . Stauffenberg rushed back to Berlin to organize a coup , but that effort failed . SS troops soon surrounded the army headquarters , and , shortly after midnight , Stauffenberg was executed along with three co-conspirators . In the attack ' s aftermath , about 200 other people were executed and 5 # 000 were arrested . Some historians have argued that the officers ' plot does not deserve such honor since the men were essentially authoritarians and anti-Semites who believed_in an imperial Germany and supported Hitler until the country ' s defeat at Stalingrad . Two days before the ceremony , unidentified protesters occupied the memorial center saying the tribute to military_officers who had been Nazis fed German nationalist sentiments . Meanwhile , Stauffenberg ' s son , Franz Ludwig , argued that Communists such_as Ulbricht and Pieck should be excised from the memorial because they were &quot; the worst scoundrels of German history &quot; and that his father did not deserve to be in &quot; the ugly company of tyrants. &quot; Organizers of the memorial argue that active opposition or resistance to Hitler alone qualifies Germans to be in the memorial , not their democratic credentials . But Kohl disagreed in the speech Wednesday that is likely to fuel the national polemic . Before a largely conservative crowd , including many German aristocrats , Kohl painted Stauffenberg and his cohorts as forefathers of German democracy , pursuers of truth and justice . And he argued that Communists had no place in the historical resistance memorial . &quot; To entirely understand the lasting meaning of German resistance for the present and future , we may_not limit ourselves to the question of what it was aimed against , &quot; he said . &quot; We have to ask ourselves what the people who took_part in it were for . The inheritance lies_in the what for. &quot;</TEXT>
