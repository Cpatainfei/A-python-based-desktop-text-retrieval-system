   <HEADLINE> BLACK HISTORY MONTH / VALLEY RETROSPECTIVE ; PERSPECTIVES ON THE PAST -- AND THE FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From the African American who owned much of what is now the San Fernando Valley in the 1790s to the high_school student who has devoted himself to keeping his peers out of gangs , people of African descent in the Valley have a long , proud history . In this special report , we look_back at some of that history and -- with the help of several voices from the present -- turn_to the future . * SAN FERNANDO / Past Is Rich but Difficult to Uncover When the students at San Fernando High_School glance at the hallway displays this month , they will see some familiar faces -- Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr. , Malcolm X and other African Americans of national fame . But they won ' t see the face of Nancy Avery , Pacoima ' s postmaster from 1961 to 1984 and the first African American to head a major post_office . They won ' t see Fernando Reyes , a biracial mayor of Los Angeles who in the 1790s owned much of what is now the San Fernando Valley . Though the history of people of African descent in the Valley is a long one , it ' s not well-known or easily accessible . The San Fernando Valley Historical Society ' s files include 11 newspaper_clippings under the heading &quot; Pacoima-Ethnic Groups. &quot; Volunteers can find only a handful of articles relating to African Americans . Itibari Zulu , librarian for UCLA ' s Center for Afro-American Studies , said he knew of no history compilation about African Americans in the Valley . &quot; I don ' t think anybody has written anything , &quot; he said . The history is there for those willing to search , however . From brothers Pio and Andres Pico -- who were of Mexican and African descent -- to the Cal State Northridge students who took_over the campus in 1968 to demand an Afro-American studies department , there is history . &quot; You have to really go and look it up but it ' s there , &quot; said William Huling , a retired sociology professor who taught Pan African studies and sociology at CSUN . &quot; There ' s a huge history of blacks in the Valley that ' s unknown. &quot; Huling discovered some of that history researching a 1978 dissertation titled &quot; Aging Blacks in Suburbia. &quot; &quot; I found it fascinating , &quot; Huling said . &quot; It really opened my eyes. &quot; Huling donated his recorded interviews with African American community leaders -- including Avery , the Rev . Hillery T . Broadous and the Rev . T . G . Pledger -- to the CSUN library , where he hopes they will inspire other scholars to follow his lead . &quot; There are so many others that need to be included , &quot; he said . Perhaps the single deepest source of historical material -- the collection of a former bookstore owner and community volunteer -- may find its way into a small library . The Pacoima Chamber_of_Commerce hopes to use material amassed by 82-year-old Pauline Jenkins -- including minutes of meetings dating to the 1950s -- to chronicle the history of Pacoima , one of the few places where blacks were encouraged to settle in the Valley after World_War_II . Marie Harris , a 32-year Pacoima resident and former honorary mayor of the community , tried to revive interest in Pacoima and its history with the &quot; Back to Pacoima Expo , &quot; but it faded in 1987 after seven years , because of the project ' s expense . The community itself , she said , should take responsibility for preserving its heritage . &quot; I think most of the blame lies_with the Afro-American community for not having honored the people who were trailblazers in our community , &quot; Harris said . &quot; Some of the history that did not get_out was because we didn ' t put it out. &quot; Now , some African Americans fear they will lose touch with even more of their past as they begin to make_up smaller percentages of the populations of old enclaves like Pacoima and Arleta , where African Americans make_up only 9 % of the communities , according to the 1990 census , compared to 17 % in 1980 . &quot; The incentive ( to research the history ) isn ' t there , &quot; said Huling . &quot; But it is history. &quot; REBECCA BRYANT</TEXT>
