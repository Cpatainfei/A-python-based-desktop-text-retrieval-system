   <HEADLINE> QUIRKY DIRECTOR , QUIRKY DETOUR ; MOVIES : BRITISH DIRECTOR ALEX COX IS GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN WITH ' HIGHWAY PATROLMAN , ' HIS FILM ON POLICE CORRUPTION IN MEXICO . FOR ONE THING , IT ' S IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talk_about playing against type . Alex Cox , the iconoclastic British director best known for the funky , surreal &quot; Repo Man &quot; and the gloriously gritty punk bio-pic &quot; Sid and Nancy , &quot; has just released his latest feature : a movie filmed in Mexico , starring Mexican actors , using a Mexican crew , on a subject with a specific Mexican bent ( police corruption ) -- and totally in Spanish , with English subtitles . Cox ' s &quot; Highway Patrolman &quot; ( &quot; El Patrullero &quot; ) , which opened Friday , is the story of rookie officer Pedro Rojas ( Roberto Sosa ) , who sheds his youthful naivete as a fresh cadet stationed in rural northern Mexico , slowly transforming into a smooth operator . The leap from quirky British films to a quirky Mexican film is one that makes perfect sense to the 39-year-old Cox , who actually had his first taste of directing in Mexico with 1987 ' s &quot; Walker , &quot; starring Ed Harris , Pedro Armendariz Jr . and Alfonso Arau ( who went_on to direct &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; ) . &quot; I wanted to go_back to Mexico to make another film , &quot; said Cox in an interview in his Culver City office , peppering his sentences with Spanish . He remembered a conversation with his friend Arau several years ago . Arau wanted Cox to work_on a sequel to his low-budget first film , &quot; Mojado Power. &quot; But Cox had other things in mind . &quot; I said , ' Listen , I will do the film , but you gotta make_it in Spanish , really make_it like a Mexican film , not like something for an American market. ' And Alfonso said : ' Alex , you ' re crazy , because no one is going_to see a film in Spanish. ' &quot; Arau , of course , never imagined the enormous success of_his_own &quot; Like Water , &quot; filmed in 1991 just months after Cox went_to Mexico to do his cop movie . It never occurred to Cox that &quot; Patrolman &quot; could be in any language but Spanish . &quot; I thought it was more correct , &quot; he explained . Cox didn ' t want to repeat what he saw as the mistake of director Luis Mandoki ' s 1987 &quot; Gaby : A True Story , &quot; based on the life of a Mexican paraplegic woman . &quot; It was quite a good film , but they did_it in English , &quot; he said . &quot; And it seemed like , oh , man , like a traicion -- a betrayal -- to do a Mexican story in English. &quot; Cox , who is fluent in Spanish , is married to a Peruvian and traces his interest in Latin_America back to his UCLA Film School_days . There he teamed_up with Peruvian scriptwriter-producer Lorenzo O ' Brien , who had grown_up in Mexico . O ' Brien is &quot; Patrolman ' s &quot; screenwriter . &quot; Highway Patrolman ' s &quot; protagonist emerged after O ' Brien interviewed a series of real Mexican patrolmen . Instead of a typical hunky hero , Pedro is thin , nondescript , always looking_for a bad_guy to prove himself against . In other words , he is painfully real , trying to make the right choices and not always succeeding . * Pedro ' s human flaws are apparent at every turn : He removes his wedding_ring when sleeping_with his mistress , although she knows full well he ' s married . He hesitantly accepts his first bribe , then uses the money to placate his wife ' s anger at his infidelities . And standing at death ' s gate , he ' s visited by the spirit of his father -- something that would never happen in an English-language film , Cox said , because &quot; English cop films don ' t have ghosts in them. &quot; Yet the controversial story would n ' t exactly have been choice subject_matter for Mexican directors either . &quot; The most important thing was to be able to talk_about a reality that we see ( in Mexico ) every day : corruption and abuse of power , &quot; said Sosa , 23 , who won the best actor award at Spain ' s San Sebastian Film Festival in 1992 for his portrayal of Pedro . To prepare_for his role , Sosa trained at Mexico ' s Transit Police_Academy . The country ' s Federal Highway Police refused to allow the actors to train on their premises , wear their uniforms or use their cars . &quot; Police corruption is a taboo topic , something no one wants to talk_about , &quot; said Sosa , who lives and acts in Mexico_City . &quot; And to have a director from outside doing such a film is very important , because a foreigner is showing interest in something that concerns us. &quot; That interest has earned Cox what may be the ultimate compliment from Mexican moviegoers , who seem to agree that the film has a definite Mexican look and outlook . ( The film opened in Mexico last April. ) Cox , whose last directorial effort was &quot; Walker , &quot; considers &quot; Patrolman &quot; to be the strongest visually of all his movies -- a result of the close collaboration between cameraman Miguel Garzon and production designer Cecilia Montiel , who convened before every single shot . Garzon ' s hand-held camera is what ultimately makes &quot; Patrolman &quot; a departure from Cox ' s other movies . &quot; What I managed to do was develop a style , &quot; Cox said . &quot; It ' s not a film that depends_on master shots , long_shots or close-ups . It exists in real time. &quot; Perhaps the movie ' s most powerful example of the use of real time occurs when Pedro ' s car breaks_down on his way to help his partner Anibal , and the camera stays with him as he painstakingly limps up an interminable hill . The camera doesn ' t cut even when he arrives_at Anibal ' s car , but instead keeps following Pedro for several yards till he finally finds his partner ' s body . Because of Pedro ' s appeal , Cox and O ' Brien are already talking_about making the logical sequel featuring Pedro , &quot; El Politico &quot; ( &quot; The Politician &quot; ) . In the meantime , the duo is working_on their next project , Ian McKellen ' s &quot; Richard III , &quot; to be filmed in England -- in English -- with Richard Harris , Anjelica Huston , Jeanne Moreau and Malcolm McDowell . Shooting is scheduled to begin this fall . &quot; We ' re still waiting to hear from the money people , &quot; said Cox , shrugging . &quot; If it doesn ' t go quickly , we ' ll just go_back to Mexico. &quot;</TEXT>
