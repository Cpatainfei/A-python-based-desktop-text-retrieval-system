   <HEADLINE> SHIP SUSPECTED OF CARRYING IMMIGRANTS SEIZED ; SMUGGLING : TAIWANESE FISHING VESSEL WITH 121 PEOPLE ABOARD IS INTERCEPTED BY COAST GUARD OFF THE COAST OF MEXICO . CONDITIONS ABOARD ARE BETTER THAN IN PREVIOUS CASES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A suspected Taiwanese smuggling vessel with 121 people aboard was being escorted toward land by the U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday -- a day after the U.S. officials seized the fishing ship to inspect it , officials said . Although officials would not say where the Jin Yinn No . 1 is heading , two Coast Guard cutters are apparently escorting the ship toward the Mexican coast , as was done_in a similar case last year involving hundreds of undocumented Chinese immigrants aboard three vessels . The Coast Guard had tracked the 168-foot Jin Yinn for about a week after it was spotted as close as 240 miles southwest of San Diego . When the Jin Yinn saw Coast Guard vessels monitoring it , the Taiwanese ship &quot; made a left turn &quot; and headed back_out to sea , said Coast Guard Chief Warrant_Officer John Hollis . On Saturday , about 890 miles southwest of San Diego , Coast Guard law_enforcement teams and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service interpreters boarded the ship and found 10 women , 101 men and 10 crew_members aboard , all_of whom appeared healthy , Hollis said . Officials also found a 10-day supply of food . &quot; The word we get is that conditions aboard the vessel are much better than normally found on these ships , &quot; Hollis said . &quot; It ' s clean . There ' s enough food. &quot; The Taiwanese government gave its permission for the boarding of the Jin Yinn , Hollis said . Last July , the Coast Guard intercepted more_than 650 undocumented Chinese on three ships off the coast of Baja . The boats were allowed to dock in Mexico after some diplomatic discussions , and all aboard were deported to China except two , who were granted asylum in the United States . The U.S._government has been cracking_down on political asylum seekers who , regardless of the merits of their claims , can stay in the U.S. for years while their cases are being settled . But Mexico can repatriate undocumented immigrants immediately . Reuter news_agency quoted State_Department spokeswoman Julie Reside as saying , &quot; Our intention is to return those aboard the vessel to their country_of_origin as quickly as possible , &quot; as &quot; the best means of discouraging future attempts to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States. &quot; Reside would not say whether the ship was bound for a U.S. or Mexican port , according to Reuter . The Jin Yinn was spotted by a Coast Guard aircraft on April 9 , southwest of San Diego . The Taiwanese vessel was trailed for five days before two Coast Guard cutters approached . When the Jin Yinn ' s crew spotted the cutters , it started to flee . The vessel faltered and stopped when an engine ran_out of oil , Hollis said . The Coast Guard provided some oil and the vessel was able to get underway under escort .</TEXT>
