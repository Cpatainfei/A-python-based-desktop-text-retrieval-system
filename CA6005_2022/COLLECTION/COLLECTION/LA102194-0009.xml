   <TEXT> I am compelled to compliment The Times and Dan Morain on his Oct . 10 article , &quot; Tobacco Giant Quietly Pushes Prop . 188. &quot; Morain highlighted the truth behind this devastating and confusing initiative . Philip Morris USA and other tobacco companies are spending more_than $ 7 million to support Proposition 188 , under the guise of &quot; Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions. &quot; The truth is that 188 would preempt or replace local smoking ordinances , replacing them with a more lenient statewide ban that would allow regulated smoking in most places . Proposition 188 is not &quot; a reasonable compromise between smokers and nonsmokers &quot; nor is it &quot; a fair , balanced , reasonable solution. &quot; Let ' s be realistic : Would the tobacco_industry really spend upwards of $ 8 million to &quot; protect &quot; our health ? In California alone , 14 people die every day from secondhand smoke , while hundreds of others suffer its effects in the form of lung_cancer , heart_disease and respiratory infections . If voters take the time to read between the lines , it is clear that Proposition 188 would be the greatest setback to California ' s progressive anti-smoking effort . Your story is a good first_step to clearing the air . TERRI JONISCH Los Angeles If the people of California are stupid enough to pass the tobacco company-sponsored Proposition 188 , then they deserve the consequences of their stupidity . KENNETH MATASSA Santa Ana When the voters approved a 25-cent tax on cigarettes in 1988 to be used for anti-smoking education , I doubt if anyone imagined that the Department of Health Services would use this money for high-priced TV commercials . In your Oct . 14 article , S . Kimberly Belshe , director of the department , states that these ads do not defame Reynolds Tobacco Chairman James W . Johnston . She must_not watch these commercials -- a revolting waste of taxpayer money . If she can ' t find better use for the funds , turn them back to the general fund . MARVIN S . LUNTZ Los Angeles</TEXT>
