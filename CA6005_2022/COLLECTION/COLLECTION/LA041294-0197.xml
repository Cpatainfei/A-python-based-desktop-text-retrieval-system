   <HEADLINE> FIRMS TO UNVEIL COMMERCENET , MARKET IT AS COMPUTER WORLD ' S HOME SHOPPING NETWORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A group of leading Silicon_Valley companies are to announce today that they are bringing their version of the home shopping network to millions of users on the worldwide computer_network known as the Internet . In what is seen as a major attempt to commercialize the ad-hoc network , the companies are launching CommerceNet , allowing users to buy computers , scan catalogues and bid on contracts . &quot; This is going_to be an electronic marketplace emanating from Silicon_Valley , &quot; said Steve Harari , president of Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp . who is acting_as the network ' s project manager . CommerceNet is backed by $ 12 million in seed money , including half from the federal_government , and has attracted such companies as Apple Computer Inc. , Sun Microsystems Inc. , Lockheed Corp . and Bank of America , all_of which are based in or near the Bay Area . The Internet is a 20-year-old collection of computer_networks from around the world that was once the preserve of advanced computer users . It now attracts a variety of personal_computer users -- about 20 million of them . The network is increasingly cited as either a forerunner , or the future backbone , of the so-called information highway . It is envisioned that consumers will shop for thousands of products at_home or the office by scanning huge databases with a computer . Montgomery Securities analyst Betty Lyter predicted on-line shopping will be a major draw for consumers and companies . &quot; Opening an outlet on an electronic shopping service would be analogous to setting_up shop_at the local mall , &quot; she wrote in a report . While a number of the networks are still very much in the planning stages , the Internet is up and running and has a rapidly growing and relatively affluent clientele . Harari said the potential for the commercial network is enormous . &quot; We ' re not sure how it ' s going_to evolve . It could include everything from pizza_parlors to real estate. &quot; He said he expects the service to be backed by 50 to 100 companies by the end of 1994 . Companies offering services on CommerceNet will pay $ 25 # 000 a year for a high-level membership , but lower-priced memberships will also be available . Internet users , after tiring of roaming cyberspace for more serious work , will be able to sign_on to a special address to access CommerceNet . Once logged_on , a computer user can scroll through various company directories . Eventually , a user will also be able to employ special computer &quot; agents &quot; to help scan the database for the best computer chip or the latest sound board . CommerceNet will make available a special computer_program called Mosaic to help the average user navigate the Internet . The system will also employ technology to scramble messages and other methods to ensure orders and protect credit_card numbers .</TEXT>
