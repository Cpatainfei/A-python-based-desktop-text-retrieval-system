   <HEADLINE> U.S. WON ' T USE AIR_POWER TO STOP GORAZDE ATTACKS ; MILITARY : BUT OFFICIALS SUGGEST SOME U.N. FORCES MIGHT ARRIVE AT THE BESIEGED BOSNIA CITY SOON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration said Thursday that it would not be willing to use U.S. air_power to stop Serbian attacks on Gorazde before U.N. peacekeeping troops reach that city in Bosnia-Herzegovina . But officials suggested that some U.N. forces might arrive there soon . White_House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake outlined the Administration position in a rare speech , apparently designed to counter critics ' complaints that the President ' s refusal so far to deploy air_power has effectively encouraged the Bosnian Serbs to continue their siege . Lake ' s remarks largely repeated the Administration ' s longstanding conditions for launching U.S. air strikes -- including the maxim that North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization aircraft would attack only to protect U.N. peacekeeping troops who are threatened . But officials disclosed that the Administration is pressing British Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia , to rush U.N. forces to the city quickly . Lake said a U.N. contingent &quot; should soon be_on its way &quot; to Gorazde . Lake also pledged that the Administration will stand_by its commitment to send U.S. ground troops into Bosnia as part of a U.N. peace-enforcement operation , if the three warring factions sign a cease-fire agreement that includes plans for a long-term political settlement . And he asserted that the United States &quot; has distinct interests at stake &quot; in Bosnia to justify &quot; strong American involvement &quot; -- from the need to help prevent a widening of the war to stemming a flood of refugees across Europe . Key U.S. officials billed Lake ' s address as the Administration ' s first attempt to prepare the American public for the possibility that the United States might send ground troops to Bosnia -- particularly in_view of recent signs that a peace accord may be imminent . Even so , that Lake felt compelled to spell_out the air-strike policy again reflected the Administration ' s difficulty in defending its limited -- and complex -- approach to the Bosnian conflict in the face of the siege of Gorazde . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry set_off a barrage of criticism Sunday when he said that the Administration would not intervene to stop Gorazde from falling to Serbian troops . &quot; We will not enter the war to stop that from happening -- that is correct , &quot; Perry asserted . Almost immediately , State_Department officials reportedly took_issue with his stance , suggesting that Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher believes that military_action must be considered . Although Perry and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , who echoed the defense_secretary ' s views Wednesday , both had left room for air strikes if the situation changed , the Administration again found itself described as sharply divided . But , ironically , while Lake ' s speech Thursday attempted to portray the Administration position as tough , it merely repeated conditions the White_House had set previously -- without directly addressing Perry ' s statements . &quot; Let me be clear -- neither the President nor any of his senior advisers rules_out the use of NATO power to help stop attacks such_as those against Gorazde , &quot; Lake told students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore . &quot; We stand_by that commitment , &quot; he added later . He also asserted that , if the Administration ultimately decides to send ground troops to help enforce a peace agreement , it would be &quot; in sufficient mass to get the job done. &quot; If U.S. forces go_into Bosnia , &quot; they will go_in strong , &quot; he said . But at_the_same_time , Lake said U.S. forces would only launch air strikes if the sorties were specifically requested by U.N. peacekeeping forces in the area and then only as part of a NATO air armada , acting_on behalf of the United Nations . He also warned that , if the United States sends ground troops to enforce a peace accord , it will set a specific date for pulling them out , as the Administration eventually did_in Somalia . &quot; Our mission will not be open-ended , &quot; he told the students . The Administration initially said that it had agreed to send about 25 # 000 U.S. troops to Bosnia -- half of a total U.N. force estimated at 50 # 000 soldiers . More recently , however , U.S. officials have said that the United States would supply &quot; less than half &quot; of a smaller total force . Administration officials have said they imposed the strict conditions on deployment of U.S. troops to avoid a protracted war in the Balkans that neither Congress nor the American public is likely to support .</TEXT>
