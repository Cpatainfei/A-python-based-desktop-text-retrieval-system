   <HEADLINE> DOING BUSINESS ; CANADA MAKES WAVES WITH FISHING RESTRICTIONS ; FACED WITH FALLING CATCHES , OFFICIALS SEIZE FOREIGN VESSELS IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS AND LOBBY FOR QUOTAS TO PRESERVE TURBOT AND OTHER SPECIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This has been a busy year for Canada ' s fish police . Led by a youthful , pugnacious fisheries minister named Brian Tobin , Canada has fashioned a sort of gunboat_diplomacy in pursuit of protecting its dwindling fish stocks . The policy has pushed Canada into a worldwide leadership position on the conservation issue , but it has also brought the country into conflict with the United States on two coasts . Canadian Coast Guard and Fisheries Department ships and planes now patrol the Atlantic beyond the country ' s 200-mile limit . Occasionally they seize foreign-flag boats -- including U.S.-based vessels -- they believe are poaching on Canadian fish , even when the vessels are in international waters . In the Pacific Northwest , Ottawa and Washington failed to reach agreement on revised salmon quotas this summer , and Canada responded by levying steep new fees on American salmon fishermen passing_through Canadian waters . When Sen . Frank H . Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) complained , Tobin dismissed him as &quot; a gnat. &quot; But if Tobin , 39 , sometimes seems to wave a privateer ' s cutlass in one hand , he carries the diplomat ' s briefcase in the other . He lobbies hard at the United Nations and other international forums for tougher restrictions on taking depleted fishing stocks -- and not without success . * In September , the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization , which sets regional fishing quotas for Canada , Europe and other North Atlantic nations , bowed to Canada ' s urgings and for the first time limited turbot catches . There were suggestions that , behind the scenes , Tobin implied that Canada would take unilateral action if the international group did nothing . &quot; We ' ve been compelled to be assertive , some would say aggressive , because the alternative is to , with our eyes wide open , preside over the destruction of the ( fishing ) resource , &quot; Tobin said in a recent interview . His apocalyptic rhetoric and damn-the-torpedoes diplomatic style is founded in the near-collapse of Canada ' s Atlantic fishery , which has wrenched the soul out of his native province of Newfoundland and fissured the economy throughout Canada ' s East Coast . In Canada ' s deteriorating fishing industry , and the country ' s thrashing attempts to save it , are lessons for the rest of the world . For , from the Bay of Biscay off France to the disputed Kuril Islands near Japan , fishermen are in conflict . In the United States , salmon fisheries in Washington and cod fisheries in New England have been closed . Many conditions underlie the spiraling problem -- environmental degradation , enhanced fishing technology , climatic changes , even an increase in the seal population . But it is perhaps most succinctly summed_up by fisherman Lawrence ( Laurie ) Sullivan , speaking in the lilt typical of this part of Newfoundland : &quot; There ' s too many boats and too few fish . that ' s the way I look_at it. &quot; According to a July report by the Worldwatch Institute , a nonprofit , international environmental research group based in Washington , the catch in every fishery in the world outside the Indian_Ocean is in decline . In three areas of the Atlantic and one in the Pacific , the harvest is down more_than 30 % since its peak year . Worldwide , the marine catch has dropped 5 % since 1989 . The continued decline not only portends further conflicts among fishermen and governments , but increased unemployment in marine communities , higher prices for consumers , a disappearing source of low-cost protein in the Third_World and the destruction of traditional fishing cultures , according to the report . Many of these problems have already taken_hold in Canada ' s Atlantic provinces , particularly in Newfoundland at the continent ' s eastern edge . When Italian-born explorer John Cabot entered the waters near St . John ' s under the_English flag in 1497 , the cod schools were so thick his men had trouble rowing their longboats through them . By 1992 , the fish were so few that Canada , in a desperate effort to preserve the species , declared a moratorium on cod fishing off Newfoundland ' s Grand Bank . The province fell_into an economic depression from which it has never recovered . Estimates of unemployed fishermen and related workers run as high as 50 # 000 in Newfoundland and neighboring provinces . One in four Newfoundlanders is_on welfare or unemployment . The government has spent more_than $ 1 billion in Canadian funds ( about $ 730 million U.S. ) on relief and compensation and promised $ 1.9 billion ( $ 1.39 billion U.S. ) more over the next five years . If the fishery ever comes_back here , it is estimated that there will only be enough work for half as_many people as were employed in fishing , processing and related trades when the 1992 moratorium went_into effect . &quot; You ' d have to be overly optimistic to say the future of the overall industry is anything but bleak , &quot; said Earle McCurdy , president of the Fishermen , Food and Allied Workers Union here . &quot; In the long_haul , I can ' t see the amount of fish we had available in the late ' 80s again in my lifetime. &quot; * The decline has not hit everyone in the Atlantic region equally . Lobster fishermen , for example , enjoyed years of record catches before there was a dip this year . The crab season this summer was also strong here . The result is a certain capriciousness of prosperity , depending_on what kind of fishing_license and equipment an individual had when the fishery went_into decline . Sullivan -- with a 45-foot oceangoing boat , a variety of licenses and a working wife -- has survived nicely , he acknowledged . He will fish crab and scallops this year . Last year , it was tuna and flounder . At age 36 , he has been fishing for 20 years , and , as is typical here , his family has fished &quot; as far back as I know. &quot; He acknowledged a certain sense of guilt that his business has survived when so many others have not , but then , turning toward the sea , noted : &quot; You don ' t get nothing out of that ocean easy. &quot; Bill Williams , baseball_cap pushed_back on his head , weather-worn clothes stretched over his barrel chest , chain-smokes cigarettes down to the filter in the kitchen of his small home_in Allendale , Nova Scotia . With the lobster season over , he will tie_up his 40-foot boat in nearby Little Harbor for the rest of the year . There is , he said , little point and no profit in going_out after cod and other bottom-dwelling species placed under greatly reduced quotas in Nova Scotia . &quot; I haven ' t even bothered this year . I can ' t see myself spending $ 300 to gear_up to make $ 50 , &quot; he said . He reluctantly acknowledged that with only a six-month lobster season and no ground fishing , he probably could not make_it without the assistance he gets from the government . &quot; I don ' t think any of us likes it , &quot; he added . Williams is bitter and angry at a government that he believes misread the early signs of a declining fishery , at big companies that are buying_up licenses from small independent fishermen unable to make_it , at fishermen who drag big nets across the ocean_floor , scooping_up fish indiscriminately . &quot; The last four years I ' ve aged more_than I ever have before , trying to beat_down the ocean , &quot; he said . &quot; But when you ' ve only got six months to get a year ' s work in . . . . &quot; Williams ' family has lived_in the area &quot; since 1700-something , &quot; and despite his tribulations in 32 years of fishing , he can ' t imagine leaving . &quot; There ' s nothing else here , and I would n ' t want to do anything else , to tell you the truth . . . . It ' s hard to explain . . . . I ' m here to the end , regardless of how it turns_out . What am I gonna do ? I ' m 51 years old next month . What am I going_to retrain for ? And how many unemployed people are there in Canada ? &quot; U.S. Rep . Barney Frank ( D-Mass. ) was outraged . Two American scallop boats out of New Bedford were tied_up in St . John ' s , Newfoundland , after being boarded in international waters by armed Canadian Coast Guard officers . Canada was claiming those scallops , even though they were outside the 200-mile limit . The boats and crews were eventually released , but Frank had a message for Fisheries Minister Tobin , who ordered the seizure . &quot; You do not resolve international disputes with the use of force , &quot; Frank fumed in a telephone_interview . &quot; You resolve them with negotiations . If Canada is going_to resort_to force , so can we. &quot; * When Alaska ' s Sen . Murkowski came_to the phone for an interview , he had cooled_off a bit since being dismissed by Tobin as &quot; a gnat &quot; for complaining about Canada ' s negotiating tactics on Pacific Northwest salmon quotas . The steep fee levied by Canada on U.S. fishing_boats had been lifted , although the money had not been returned . &quot; He ( Tobin ) is attempting to establish himself as a hard driver and as one who ' s had to deal with Canada ' s situation on the Atlantic Coast , he ' s determined not to allow it to happen on the West Coast , &quot; Murkowski said . &quot; But he ' s not very diplomatic . . . and clearly in violation of international law. &quot; Tobin ' s response is that at least he ' s now got everyone ' s attention . He suggested that a year ago there probably were few people in Washington who could speak with much expertise on the international fishing crisis . A career politician who grew_up on a U.S. Air_Force base in Newfoundland where his father worked as a contract firefighter , Tobin became minister of fisheries and oceans a year ago after the election of the Liberal_Party as Canada ' s national government . He had already gained fame in Parliament as an acid-tongued critic of the Conservative government of former Prime_Minister Brian Mulroney . Tobin and a handful of other Liberal members_of_Parliament became known as the &quot; Rat Pack &quot; for their verbal gnawing on Mulroney . Some of those stung by Tobin ' s aggressive enforcement tactics these days might appreciate the nickname . &quot; In an emergency situation -- and that ' s what we ' re talking_about when some of the ( fish ) stocks are disappearing from the face of the planet forever -- we can ' t agree when someone says , ' Let ' s talk_about this for another year and meanwhile we ' ll keep fishing , ' &quot; Tobin said . &quot; If that ' s the case , I know the kind of solution they ' re talking_about . It ' s called no more fish . &quot; We ' ve proven we can talk ourselves down to the last fish . . . . So , should we be talking ? Absolutely . Should we be cooperating ? Absolutely . Could Canada and the U.S. be a model ( of cooperation ) for the world , as we have been_on other issues ? Absolutely . But I won ' t apologize for protecting resources near the Canada coast. &quot; Tobin ' s tough posture toward foreign fishermen stems in part from domestic politics . It makes the harsh quotas placed on Canadian fishermen more palatable , although Tobin ' s take is that he is not asking fishermen from other countries to do anything he does not demand of Canadian fishermen . &quot; We have brought a new ethic , a new standard to our enforcement issues , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s put us on the moral high ground. &quot; Biography Name : Brian Tobin Title : Canada ' s Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Age : 39 Personal : Spent childhood living_on a U.S. Air_Force base in Stephanville , where his father was a contract firefighter .
