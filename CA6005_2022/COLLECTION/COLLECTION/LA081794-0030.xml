   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON PERSECUTION ; NASRIN : A POLITICAL WOMAN-HUNT ; A BANGLADESHI WRITER , DEMONIZED BY ISLAMIC FANATICS , IS CHARGED WITH ' BLASPHEMY ' IN ORDER TO DIVERT THE OPPRESSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taslima Nasrin , a Bangladeshi author threatened with assassination by zealots for comments perceived to be anti-Islamic , fled to Sweden last week after being officially charged in Bangladesh with offending Muslims . Novelist and critic Susan Sontag addresses a letter to Nasrin in exile . Your case , if that ' s the right word , has often been cited as a new example of the far-reaching , implacable judgment that has obliged Salman Rushdie to live_in Britain under armed_guard , constantly moving from one clandestine residence to another , for the past five years . Salman Rushdie wrote a novel , &quot; The Satanic Verses , &quot; and one of the reviews was a death sentence . Last year you wrote a novel , &quot; Lajja &quot; ( &quot; Shame &quot; ) , which was first published in your country , then swiftly banned ; and after the banning came the calls to prosecute you for blasphemy , the penalty for which is death . There is of course the difference that you have been persecuted and menaced by political forces in the country of which you are a citizen , while the_British citizen Salman Rushdie was first sentenced to death in a country with which he had no connection , Iran . But it is the same charge : &quot; blasphemy &quot; or , in more secular language , that a writer has &quot; offended &quot; the feelings of believers . But there is another element in your situation that I can ' t help being sensitive to , since I am not only a fellow writer but belong_to the same half of the human_race as you . You are not only being judged as a writer . You are being judged as a woman . You are part of a noble tradition of women in the Islamic world of the 20th Century . Perhaps the senior figure is the Egyptian writer ( and , like yourself , physician ) , Nawal El Saadawi , who for decades has been writing books that denounce the exploitation and oppression of women . There is , if I may put it this way , nothing original in the demands you are making . And this is all to your credit . In fact , your ordeal is not about reactions to a book . It is not even about religion . What has happened to Salman Rushdie and to you -- and to other less-well-publicized instances of the persecution and murder of writers and journalists in Algeria , Egypt , Iran , Syria , Iraq and many other countries -- is about politics . Your persecution is an instrument of concrete political struggles taking_place now in Bangladesh , where so many forms of oppression and economic misery are rife . But the political factions that have put your life at risk are indeed similar to the political factions in various countries that continue to send hit teams to Britain to kill Salman Rushdie . In modern mass politics , masses need to be &quot; mobilized , &quot; and the way this is done is with easy , obfuscating slogans . The demonization of individuals , in witch hunts and show_trials , is a cheap way to encapsulate the power and appeal of repressive activism . And the signature element of a repressive society ( or the degree of oppression in a society ) is the oppression of women . Those who persecute you are political opportunists -- manipulating an idea of &quot; blasphemy &quot; to distract oppressed people , men and women both , from understanding what is persecuting and exploiting them . You did not ask_for a revision of the Koran -- as you were charged with doing . ( The charge is grotesque , of course . What could it mean to &quot; revise &quot; the founding book of a great religion ? ) What you did was to recommend certain revisions in the Sharia , a body of laws codifying custom and practice that have developed over centuries , and like all bodies of law , is subject_to revision and reform . As it happens , the charge of blasphemy brought against you is absurd -- though I would want to defend you even if you could be correctly described as a blasphemer . Needless to say , I support your cause for a reform of the Sharia . That is , I support your demands for freedom for the half of the human_race to which we both belong . Bangladesh cannot begin to be a just society , for both women and men , until the situation of women there improves . What has happened to you is not just another instance of highly developed 20th-Century tradition of persecuting dissident writers . It is as well a woman-hunt . As in the witch hunts that took_place for centuries in Europe , the target in many Islamic countries has become , above all , women -- women who are not meek and servile , women who dare speak out , women who are ( or seem ) different . In your name , all women , as well as all writers who dare to think independently , are being persecuted .</TEXT>
