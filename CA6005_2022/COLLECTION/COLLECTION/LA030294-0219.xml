   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : MILKEN CAMPUS SERVICES RELOCATED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most programs offered at the Bernard Milken Jewish Community Campus have been relocated to a former warehouse near Warner Center while earthquake damage at the permanent location is repaired . The 20 # 000-square-foot temporary site on Independence Avenue in Woodland Hills will be used until repairs are completed , said Earl Greinetz , president of the San Fernando Valley Alliance of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles . The campus is operated by the alliance . Most of the damage caused by the earthquake was_due to ruptured water and sprinkler lines indoors , Greinetz said , and the West Hills campus may be reopened as soon as late this year . Even before the earthquake , the 6-year-old campus had been scheduled to close this spring for several months for roof repairs and seismic reinforcement , Greinetz said . &quot; We had begun the relocation process , starting with the children ' s services , &quot; Greinetz said . &quot; Then the earthquake hit and we had no choice but to relocate right away. &quot; The roof and other structural repairs were deemed necessary by a team of private engineers last December . &quot; There were deficiencies in the construction of the buildings , &quot; said Robert Powell of the engineering firm Powell , Mika &amp; Associates . &quot; They weren ' t built according to the plans and would have come under the hazardous building ( designation ) . &quot; As programs such_as the West Valley Jewish Community_Center , the Jewish Vocational Service and the Jewish Family Service of Los Angeles were forced to scramble to a new location , the umbrella group linking them also underwent a major reorganization -- along with a name change , Greinetz said . The San Fernando Valley Alliance of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles , formerly the San Fernando Valley Region of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles , gained control over its own budget and administration , becoming semiautonomous from the rest of the council . &quot; When we were a ' region ' of the larger council , we had to spend money in the way we were told , &quot; Greinetz said . &quot; This is a step toward solving our problems of needing more responsibility. &quot; KURT PITZER</TEXT>
