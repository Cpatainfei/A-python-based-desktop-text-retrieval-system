   <HEADLINE> GIAN MARIA VOLONTE ; ACTOR IN THEATER , SPAGHETTI WESTERNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italian actor Gian Maria Volonte , whose roles ranged from Shakespeare to the bad_guy in the spaghetti western &quot; A Fistful of Dollars , &quot; has died at age 61 . Volonte , who acted in more_than 40 films in a 34-year career , was found dead Tuesday in his hotel_room in the northern Greek town of Florina , where he was to appear in &quot; The Gaze of Ulysses &quot; by Greek director Theodoros Angelopoulos . Italian news_reports said Volonte was believed to have suffered a heart_attack . &quot; The world , not just Italy , has lost a great actor , &quot; said director Francesco Rosi , in whose films &quot; The Mattei Affair &quot; ( 1972 ) , &quot; Lucky Luciano &quot; ( 1973 ) and &quot; Christ Stopped at Eboli &quot; ( 1979 ) Volonte played leading roles . &quot; He had extraordinary sensitivity , an enormous talent to bring_out the personality of a character through a simple gesture , without saying a word , &quot; Rosi added . Volonte , born into a middle-class Milan family in 1933 , attended Rome ' s National School of Dramatic Art and made his theater debut in Shakespeare ' s &quot; Romeo and Juliet &quot; in 1959 . A year later he made his first film appearance with a small part in Duilio Coletti ' s &quot; Under Ten Flags. &quot; But his first major film role was in 1963 in &quot; A Man to Burn &quot; by Valentino Orsini and Paolo and Vittorio Taviani . In the film , he showed the first evidence of an intense realism he would bring_to many roles , playing a Sicilian union leader who threatens to stage an uprising against the Mafia . A militant left-winger , Volonte took_part in protests during the 1960s and 1970s and served briefly in parliament for the Communist_Party . So it came as no surprise that his greatest award , the 1987 Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival , was for a political film , &quot; The Moro Affair , &quot; in which he played Aldo Moro , the Italian Christian Democratic former prime_minister kidnaped and killed by left wing guerrillas in 1978 . He also won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1983 for his role in &quot; The Death of Mario Ricci. &quot; Volonte made his name outside Italy in the 1960s as the bad_guy in Sergio Leone ' s spaghetti Westerns &quot; A Fistful of Dollars &quot; and &quot; For a_Few Dollars More. &quot;</TEXT>
