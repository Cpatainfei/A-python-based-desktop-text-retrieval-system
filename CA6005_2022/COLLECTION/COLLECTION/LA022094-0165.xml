   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES ARE ADRIFT IN A SEA OF BUREAUCRACY ; SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AREAS HAVE DECLINED IN QUALITY BECAUSE OFFICIALDOM can ' t OR WON ' T ACT . COURT ACTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO RESCUE THESE OPEN-SPACE PRESERVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If a poll_taker asked_for a definition of the acronym SEA , most people would have no idea . Yet Significant Ecological Areas are important if one believes that Southern California is_well on its way to becoming wall-to-wall housing tracts and commercial zones . SEAs are designated by Los Angeles County as open spaces of special value for native plants and wildlife that must be preserved from inappropriate development . They were included in the county ' s General Plan in 1980 , five years after a lawsuit alleging a lack of open-space protection in the plan forced the Board of Supervisors to rewrite it . Some of the excellent SEAs are Tujunga Wash , Santa Susana Pass , Chatsworth Reservoir and the Santa Clara River . It sounded wonderful , containing a commitment &quot; to preserve the county ' s ecological resources and habitat areas in as viable a natural condition as possible. &quot; Those of us with affection for canyons , wetlands and woodlands took_heart . Alas , we were soon disenchanted . * The board was controlled by a conservative majority -- Michael Antonovich , Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum -- that never met a developer it didn ' t like . They were unable to get_rid_of SEAs , but they were not obligated to make them work . SEAs are almost all_in private hands . Under the General Plan , homes may be built &quot; at densities compatible with the resource values present. &quot; Who decides what ' s a compatible density ? A technical advisory committee of volunteer biologists , called SEATAC , was set_up to make this judgment . But it was given no real power . It can only advise and suggest . The Planning_Commission and the Board of Supervisors make all_the decisions . Over time , SEAs have gradually declined_in_quality . With increased population and the disappearance of land suitable for homes close to jobs , developers have reached_out to more distant locations , which is where the SEAs are . Permits to build were generously issued until some of the SEAs were so exploited that they lost the values that made them significant . SEATAC cannot monitor the condition of the 61 SEAs because the county refused to pay_for a study . The county can protect an SEA by buying_it , but the supervisors have successfully resisted the temptation . Although federal and state agencies have sought to acquire SEAs -- and had the funds -- they received no encouragement or cooperation from the county . What can be done to stop the eventual destruction of SEAs ? A tough question . Electing a Board of Supervisors that gives_a_damn would help . Changing the General Plan to further restrict development in SEAs might make a difference . Buying them outright would solve the problem . At this time the answer must be : None of the above . What about the courts ? Several lawsuits have been filed recently , and that may indicate a way_out . A strong challenge to the inadequate SEA system is called_for , a test_case that will establish genuine protection for natural habitats . One is in the works . * As you approach Magic Mountain going north on Interstate 5 from Los Angeles , you pass a marvelous stretch of undisturbed valley_oaks . These elegant trees with their wide sweeping branches are surrounded by grassland that rises gently to form low , sensuous hills . Because this habitat is so scarce , 300 acres was designated SEA 64 , Valley_Oaks Savannah . There are about 1 # 200 oaks in the SEA , one of the last two remaining oak savannahs in Southern California . What many people were dreading finally came_to pass . A project was proposed for almost 2 # 000 homes and a golf_course for 200 acres of the SEA . SEATAC , the California Parks Department and even the staff of the county Planning Department opposed the project . But the Planning_Commission and the supervisors approved it anyway . Environmentalists sued , charging inconsistencies with the General Plan and violation of the California Environmental Quality Act . * In June , 1993 , the court agreed that the project would generate excessive air_pollution and overtax school and library facilities . Unfortunately , the judge did not rule on the most important issue : the county ' s refusal to adhere to its own General Plan . The case was appealed . A favorable decision would establish the precedent that the county must honor the spirit of the General Plan . A victory would mean the potential rescue of all SEAs from their inevitable oblivion . Unhappily , a procedural error by the plaintiffs threw the case out and the opportunity was missed . Bad_luck , but not the end of the world . Another lawsuit is in the making for SEA 64 .</TEXT>
