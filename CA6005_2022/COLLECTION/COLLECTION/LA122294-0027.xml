   <HEADLINE> AN ADDICTION THAT AFFLICTS US ALL ; EVERYONE FOOTS THE HUGE BILL IMPOSED BY THE CRACK EPIDEMIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crack cocaine has been around for only a decade , but the cheap , potent and addictive high that it offers has destroyed countless individuals , plus whole families , neighborhoods , communities . The epidemic has also drained public coffers and overwhelmed public safety , public health and child welfare resources . It forces government to choose between improving schools , libraries and recreational_facilities , for example , and stanching the flood of destruction caused by the drug_abuse . It is a no-win choice . The costs and consequences of crack are higher and affect American society more_than is commonly understood , according to the Los Angeles Times_series &quot; The Real Cost of Crack , &quot; by staff writers Rich Connell , Jesse Katz , David Ferrell and John Mitchell . The loss of public dollars reaches_into the hundreds of millions . Total taxpayer cost related to one addicted mother during her 10 years of abuse ranged from $ 250 # 000 to more_than $ 300 # 000 , according to the Times_series . Providing_for her three children in foster care amounted to $ 150 # 000 . From $ 75 # 000 to $ 100 # 000 more was spent on medical_expenses for the birth of one premature &quot; crack baby. &quot; Also add $ 25 # 000 for jail and prison costs stemming from arrests and eventual conviction on prostitution and drug-related charges . And , finally , add $ 15 # 000 for residential drug treatment , the best method of helping addicts recover . And all this is the public cost for only one family . More treatment is clearly needed , particularly residential care . Unfortunately , the most prevalent public-funded treatment addresses not crack but heroin_addiction or alcoholism . The state and county ought to throw_out outdated assumptions and reconfigure priorities . If a crack addict wants to shake the habit , he or she needs help immediately . A state study proves that $ 1 spent on treatment can save $ 7 . Cocaine-addicted babies can ' t escape the child_abuse they suffered in the womb . These tiny victims are often born prematurely and in need of expensive neonatal care . Their ailments strain the public health system . Treating drug-exposed infants at Los Angeles County public hospitals is estimated to have cost $ 22 million in 1991 , the most recent figure available . Children of addicted parents enjoy little sense of family or security . Usually , responsibility for them falls to a benevolent relative , the overburdened foster care system or the county ' s crowded shelter , MacLaren Children ' s Center . A new study by the county Department of Children ' s Services of 613 youngsters in the system found at least one parent abusing crack in 44 % of randomly selected cases . That finding explains why the child welfare caseload has doubled in the last decade , and why the related public spending exceeds $ 200 million . No one can deny the impact of crack addiction on violent crime . Crack-related arrests clog the courts , the jails and the prisons . Interdiction is a federal obligation , but the feds are unable to turn_off the flow of illicit drugs into the country . Because the supply cannot be stopped , demand must be reduced through preventive efforts such_as the DARE program for children and , of course , through widely available residential drug treatment . The devastation of crack touches all Americans in some way . The problem is everybody ' s problem .</TEXT>
