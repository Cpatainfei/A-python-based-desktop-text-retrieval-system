   <TEXT> * Re your editorial &quot; A Forward Move for RU-486 , &quot; March 8 : &quot; That Roussel Uclaf is talking_about U.S. distribution is certainly welcome news. &quot; Well , I know I breathed a big sigh of relief.Now we can abort fetuses in the privacy of_our_own home . I am not a member of either the pro-life or pro-choice movement and do not consider myself fanatic about the issue of abortion -- it ' s much too complicated and sad an issue . I neither condemn those who choose to have an abortion , or those who wish to fight abortion . But let ' s face it , please : Abortion is about ending a human life -- in whatever stage one believes that life to be in . It ' s a very very difficult situation and procedure for anyone . The fact that it has been politicized , fragmented and defined as a &quot; women ' s right &quot; surprises and disappoints me . And to write that this easier technique is &quot; welcome news &quot; makes my heart break . A population that embraces and endorses and practices sexual responsibility and education to prevent the need for many abortions would be very &quot; welcome news. &quot; I think some sensitivity is called_for here .
