   <HEADLINE> PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT ; SOUTH COAST LEAGUE ; MISSION VIEJO REACHES PLAYOFFS BY BEATING SAN CLEMENTE , 24-21</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The drought is over . OK , so it only lasted one year . But that was one year too long for the folks at Mission Viejo . First-year coach Bill Denny gave Diablo fans what they wanted , a 24-21 playoff-clinching victory over San Clemente in a South Coast League game Friday night at Mission Viejo High . That ensures the Diablos ( 4-6 , 3-2 ) of third place and a berth in the playoffs , which Mission Viejo missed last year for the first time since 1977 . &quot; You can ' t ask_for anything more as far as a high_school game . I ' m proud_of these kids , &quot; Denny said . &quot; At the start of the year we didn ' t think wins or losses . We wanted to go_back ( to the playoffs ) . That was our goal. &quot; The Diablos did_it with a big-play offense . Of their four scores , two came_on the first play of the drive and another on the second play . Ryan Ballas started it with a 70-yard touchdown run_on the second play of the game , and Todd Fielding finished it with a 70-yard scoring run with 1 minute 46 seconds remaining in the third quarter . Mission Viejo took_advantage of two turnovers by San Clemente to build a 17-7 halftime lead , then turned_to its defense after the Tritons closed to within three with 7:39 left on a 19-yard pass from Jeff Carlin to Trevor Insley , his second touchdown of the game . San Clemente ( 4-6 , 1-4 ) was stopped twice with less than three minutes remaining . MICHAEL CASEY</TEXT>
