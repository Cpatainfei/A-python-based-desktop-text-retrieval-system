   <HEADLINE> MUSLIM UNREST IN CHINA CONFIRMED ; RELIGION : OFFICIAL NEWS_AGENCY SAYS 22 PEOPLE RECEIVED LONG PRISON_TERMS THIS MONTH IN CONNECTION WITH DEADLY RIOT IN MAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a rare confirmation of unrest among China ' s Muslims , official sources said Sunday that 49 people were killed when paramilitary police units moved_in to suppress fighting between rival religious groups outside a Ningxia province mosque last May . The official New China News_Agency said 22 people , including a prominent Ningxia province political_leader and two Muslim academics , were sentenced to long prison_terms this month after they were convicted on charges that included murder and &quot; unlawfully buying guns and ammunition &quot; in connection with the incident . Chinese authorities claimed they confiscated 5 # 442 guns and 21 homemade cannons after what they described as &quot; gang_fighting &quot; in the city of Xiji , 700 miles southwest of Beijing . The Ningxia incident was the bloodiest in a series of Muslim disturbances that occurred in western China last year . Incidents involving China ' s Muslims -- who number between 20 million and 40 million , according to various estimates -- are a sensitive issue with the Chinese Communist government , particularly in light of Muslim nationalist and fundamentalist movements in the former southern Soviet republics and other regions of Central Asia . On Oct . 7 , Chinese military_forces stormed a mosque in Xining , capital of Qinghai province , and arrested Muslim leaders who the government claimed had &quot; assaulted local party and government_offices , smashed police vehicles and besieged and attacked people and security and armed policemen. &quot; Demonstrations by Muslims protesting the publication of a children ' s book they claimed insulted the Islamic faith were also reported in Gansu , Xinjiang and Sichuan provinces . Ningxia province is the center of China ' s Hui Muslim minority population that converted to Islam when the region was an important destination for Arab traders in the 7th Century . Several times in Chinese history , the Ningxia population has figured in extensive demonstrations against the country ' s authorities . Although the incident in May appeared to involve rival religious groups attempting to win control of a regional sect , Chinese authorities fear any episode that could ignite the scattered Muslim population and threaten to divide the country . According to the New China News_Agency , one of those arrested in Ningxia was a prominent local politician , Ma Liesun , who served on the national committee in Beijing representing China ' s minority populations . He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and stripped of his political rights for four years after his conviction for &quot; intentional murder &quot; and various gun charges . Ma Fuli , associate_professor at the Ningxia Normal College , and Ma Rucheng , described as a farmer , were charged with the same crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment . Ma Jie , a lecturer at the Northwest No . 2 Nationalities Institute , received a sentence of 20 years , also on the same charges . Beginning in May , 1992 , the news_agency reported , the four men &quot; organized gang fighting and revenge despite warnings from the local_government and Communist_Party committee. &quot; Southern Ningxia province , where the incident took_place , has long been a stronghold of Sufism , the mystical school of Islam that has often played a role in revolts against authority in China . In widespread Muslim revolts between 1855 and 1873 , a powerful Sufi leader named Ma Hualong held Qing Dynasty armies at_bay for years . According to sources , the fighting in May was the result of a succession battle in the Sufi Zheherenye sect following the death of the sect ' s imam , Ma Tenghai , in June , 1991 . The sect is reported to have 100 # 000 followers in Ningxia . The contest to replace Ma Tenghai turned_to violence , with rival parties battling outside the Xiji mosque when Chinese People ' s Armed Police were called . Authorities did not say how many of the dead , if any , had been killed by police gunfire .</TEXT>
