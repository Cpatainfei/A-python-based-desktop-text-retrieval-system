   <HEADLINE> KEY BARRIER TO ALASKA OIL EXPORT LIFTED ; TRADE : MOVE COULD CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND HELP REVIVE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY . CONGRESS MUST OK AN END TO THE BAN , WHICH COULD EASE IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN , THE LIKELIEST MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secret negotiations have cleared_away the key obstacle to lifting the ban on export of Alaskan crude_oil , a move that could lead to the revival of California ' s moribund oil_industry and create thousands of jobs in the state . Independent California oil producers estimate that ending the export ban could trim more_than $ 2 billion annually from the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan , the likeliest market for the oil . Until now , U.S. maritime unions -- whose crews by law now tanker the Alaskan oil to U.S. ports in California and the Gulf Coast -- have opposed lifting the ban , effectively quashing congressional action . But the unions have accepted a deal in principle that would send the oil to Asian markets on U.S.-flag ships , sources close to the talks say . That agreement -- reached in recent weeks by the unions and British Petroleum , one of the big Alaskan oil producers -- means that Congress will probably remove the export ban as it extends the Export Administration Act , a measure now under_consideration in the House and Senate , according to officials familiar_with legislative discussions . Independent California oil producers and oil_companies working in Alaska -- principally British Petroleum -- have lobbied long and hard to end the ban , which they say floods the California market with Alaskan crude . That depresses oil prices in the region and makes_it uneconomical to pump oil from California fields , the industry contends . Since 1985 , 32 # 000 jobs and $ 623 million in state and local taxes and royalty payments have been lost , according to estimates by the California Independent Petroleum Assn . The ban is &quot; a relic &quot; of 20 years ago , said Dan Kramer , executive_director of the producer trade group . The export limits -- and the assurance of U.S. control of the shipping jobs -- were embedded in the legislation that authorized construction of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline . At first , most of the crude made the long journey from Alaska to refineries on the Gulf Coast . But in recent years , as West Coast refineries have been modified to accept the Alaskan crude , most of the oil has ended_up making the shorter , less expensive trip to California . That , California producers say , forces an extra 300 # 000 barrels a day of Alaskan crude into the California market . Others estimate that the &quot; excess &quot; oil is about half that . Officials of the Seafarers International Union , headquartered in Washington , declined to comment Friday , and British Petroleum executives could not be reached for comment . But other sources confirmed the outline of the agreement . Most agreed that a pact between BP and the unions would have to be given the force of law by Congress . Howard Marlowe , spokesman for the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil -- a group that opposes lifting the ban -- confirmed to the Associated Press that some coalition members have told BP they would support the deal . Exxon Corp . and Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co. , both big producers in Alaska , use their crude primarily in their own refineries and distribution networks . But BP has long wanted to sell its Alaskan oil to Asian refiners -- sales from which the company can expect higher profits . Diverting the Alaskan crude to Asia would spur production by California refiners and almost certainly raise their prices , which they say are depressed by $ 2 to $ 5 a barrel . In both states , oil experts expect that lifting the ban would increase investment in the industry . But few believe it would significantly affect the price of gasoline at California pumps because retail prices depend largely on world oil prices . BP approached the U.S. maritime unions about a month ago , according to one knowledgeable maritime attorney , asking whether they would drop their opposition to lifting the ban in exchange for the assurance that U.S. ships and sailors would keep their jobs transporting the oil . &quot; And as of about a week ago , maritime labor said yes , &quot; the attorney said Friday . U.S. shipping executives apparently agree . &quot; They think they have a better chance of utilizing existing boats and perhaps building a_couple_of new boats &quot; under such an agreement &quot; than if ( they continue to support ) the dwindling traffic to the gulf , &quot; the lawyer said . Many in the Clinton_Administration have favored ending the ban , but opposition in Congress has been led by the unions and shipping concerns . The U.S. Department_of_Energy has been studying the economic and employment impact of lifting the ban , and Assistant Energy_Secretary William White is scheduled to detail some of the study ' s findings Monday in Monterey , at the annual meeting of the producers association . Earlier industry-sponsored studies held that ending the ban would create 5 # 500 to 15 # 000 jobs in California and increase production in the state by as much as 500 # 000 barrels a day . &quot; If the analysis concludes that lifting the ban would benefit independent producers , domestic production and the state , I would be a strong advocate , &quot; Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said during a visit to California in February .</TEXT>
