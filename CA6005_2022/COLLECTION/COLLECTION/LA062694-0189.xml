THE FILMMAKERS ARE BEING FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK AND THE WORKING-CLASS BLACKS WHO LIVED IN THAT LOS ANGELES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When someone from a movie company says they ' re going to show you Los Angeles on the screen as you ' ve never seen it before , the chance that this statement will turn_out to be not entirely true is a distinct possibility . The filmmakers at the helm of the forthcoming TriStar movie &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; are now repeating those very words , but on the face of it , they seem to have more to promise than most . Adapted from the 1990 Walter Mosley mystery novel of the same title and starring Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals , &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; will show a side of the city that has not been much photographed by Hollywood : specifically , the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles just after World_War_II . The film , which has just finished shooting on locations around the city , is drawn from a story cast in the mold of film noir , but it is film noir peopled largely by working-class African Americans who in 1948 , it will be remembered , were still living_on the far side of the civil_rights movement . &quot; There was an unwritten code for black people at the time , &quot; says the film ' s director , Carl Franklin , who , like Mosley and Washington , is black . &quot; You don ' t go north of Slauson Avenue , you don ' t go_to Venice or Malibu . You don ' t go_to Hollywood at night . You could get picked_up ( by the police ) . The movie we ' re making is set against a very racist milieu. &quot; Washington , 39 , plays the part of Easy Rawlins , a World_War_II combat veteran and aircraft assembly-line worker who stumbles into a new_line of work as a private_detective when a tough-talking white_man offers him money to locate a mysterious white_woman known to frequent black jazz joints . Beals plays the part of the mysterious woman , who bears the noirish name of Daphne Monet . She has a secret , as readers of the novel already know and which the filmmakers would rather not advertise , at least until the movie opens sometime next winter . On a recent Friday afternoon , Franklin and his cast were_on location in a very white neighborhood of Pasadena , using the stately white stone main building of the private Mayfield Senior School as the setting for the foundation offices of Todd Carter , a wealthy businessman in_love with Daphne who , at this point in the story , has disappeared . Mosley , 42 , who grew_up in Los Angeles but now lives_in New York City , was in town to see how things were going and was pleased to discover that the set of Carter ' s office was exactly as he had originally imagined it . &quot; This is beautiful , &quot; said the author , who was wearing a black polo_shirt as he sat in a sun-dappled garden on the baronial school grounds that in the 1940s were the private estate of silk thread manufacturer John Eagle . &quot; I walk into the room and check_out Carter ' s office , and when I went_in there , I ' m looking_at the office that I wrote , right down to the bottle of brandy and the glasses . Pretty wonderful. &quot; Mosley wrote an early draft of the script himself when the movie was in development at another studio , but the screenplay being filmed was written by Franklin . This suits the author just fine . &quot; I ' m not a cinematic thinker , &quot; Mosley confided . Nevertheless , TriStar has retained him as an associate producer . &quot; Basically Carl calls me up and asks questions . He had to change the name of a character the other day and he called me up and we talked_about it . &quot; He ' s cut_out a_few things . A couple of the characters have been combined . But I think he ' s been very true_to the novel as_a_whole . I have no problem with the way he ' s changed it. &quot; When it was published four years ago , &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; drew immediate attention to its young author and attracted movie interest from such actors as Danny Glover , Wesley Snipes and Tim Reid , all intrigued with the possibilities of playing Easy Rawlins , a heroic black protagonist chasing demons through the unexamined racism of post-war California . But a movie did not get_off_the_ground until producer Jesse Beaton happened_upon the book and brought it to Franklin ' s attention about the same time that TriStar-affiliated director-producer Jonathan Demme saw Franklin ' s low-budget critical success &quot; One False Move &quot; and called to say he wanted to work with him . ( Demme is executive producer of &quot; Devil. &quot; ) Then Bill_Clinton got elected President . Candidate Clinton had already told members of the press that Mosley was one of his favorite writers , and the day after the election at least one national newspaper ran a front-page story speculating about what was going_to be &quot; in &quot; once Clinton was in the White_House -- a list that included the Easy Rawlins mysteries . &quot; So we sent that to ( Mike ) Medavoy , &quot; Franklin , 45 , said with a big smile , referring to the then-chairman of TriStar . &quot; I don ' t know exactly how much that had to do with anything , but everything seemed to move a little quicker after Clinton was elected. &quot; Mosley said he had not imagined Easy being played by any particular actor , though he is understandably pleased to see Oscar winner Washington in the role . &quot; A lot of people you talk to , they say , ' Who do you see as Easy ? ' But I come from the theater where if someone tells you Laurence Olivier is going_to play Hercules , you say , ' Gee , I wonder how he ' s going_to do that ? ' that ' s the way I think. &quot; Beals , who was not in the day ' s scenes but had come_to the set to watch , said she wanted the part of Daphne badly since first listening to the book on audiocassette while filming the upcoming &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle &quot; in New York . &quot; Ugh ! Did I read for it ? &quot; she said . &quot; I jumped through burning hoop after burning hoop and watched as they got smaller . I never wanted a part like I wanted this part. &quot; As a clutch of Mayfield ' s Catholic girls waited politely to get her autograph , Beals , 30 , clad in casual black , stepped gingerly around what she called &quot; the truth &quot; about Daphne . &quot; I don ' t know how much I can talk_about it because it should be a surprise. &quot; She did say the role was proving difficult because &quot; a character like this , there ' s no moment where I ' m just sitting over a cup of coffee chatting with somebody . Every moment is a life-or-death situation , so it ' s pretty extreme. &quot; The leading lady of &quot; Flashdance &quot; said the clothes she is wearing in &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress , &quot; as the girlfriend of a wealthy_man running_for mayor , are &quot; very alluring but very tasteful -- pearls . There is one dress that ' s a little more sensual , a little more degenerate. &quot; Daphne , she explained , &quot; has to use the weapons that she has. &quot; One of the changes that Franklin has made in the story is to build_up Daphne ' s romance with Carter ( played by Terry Kinney ) , who in the film is a somewhat younger character than in the book . &quot; I didn ' t want this to be an older guy who ' s got this sweet thing , &quot; Franklin said . &quot; I wanted it to be a situation where he might be losing a very vital love relationship . Especially with Jennifer . Jennifer looks_like she could be the mayor ' s wife . She has that carriage. &quot; At the same time , Daphne ' s romantic fling with Easy in the novel evidently has been toned_down . An erotic bathtub scene involving the two of them will not be in the movie . &quot; It ' s a great scene ; I love that scene , &quot; Beals said . &quot; But no , it ' s not in the script . I ' m not falling_for Easy as much as I was in the book or as I was in the first drafts of the script . There ' s a lot of flirtation and a lot of tension . But who knows ? With Carl , all_of a sudden he could change it back and it would be in there. &quot; Although recognized by some as an actor who had a recurring role on &quot; The A Team &quot; and who made his first films with Roger Corman , Franklin demonstrated in &quot; One False Move , &quot; an interracial crime thriller , that he could handle violence on the screen in a realistic but unspectacular way . &quot; Coming from an acting background , the emotions are more important to me . It ' s the invasion of humanity that I think is important about violence . It ' s not whether we have some neat way of killing somebody. &quot; When things get truly desperate for Easy in the story , he gets some muscular help from an old childhood friend named Mouse ( played by Don Cheadle , lately of television ' s &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; ) . In the novel , Mouse is a key figure but in an earlier draft of the script he had been eliminated , with the thought that some of his action-hero qualities be grafted onto Easy himself . &quot; They wanted Easy to be a stronger character , &quot; Franklin said of another studio ' s creative executives . &quot; But that ' s not who Easy is . Easy ' s dilemma is that he ' s a guy who ' s fighting fear : the basic fears of a black_person in 1948 , problems with the police , being in the wrong neighborhood at the wrong time ; afraid because he ' s been in the war and has killed , afraid of becoming like that again ; afraid of being killed ; afraid of becoming like Mouse. &quot; He said he found a quick affinity for the story of &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; since its background details roughly parallel his own . Easy and many other of Mosley ' s characters are blacks who migrated from Texas and Louisiana during World_War_II to work in California ' s shipyards and defense plants . This is the story of Mosley ' s family and Franklin ' s as well . &quot; Film noir is one of my favorite genres , &quot; the director said , &quot; although I don ' t think you need to approach it as a genre when you do_it . I like the ' 40s , I like detective kind of things . But what I never liked about them is the inaccessibility of the characters . Usually they ' re people that you never run_into in real_life . You know , where does ( Phillip ) Marlowe live ? Who ' s his mom ? Where did he come from ? Same with the Continental Op or Sam Spade . The thing about these people is that they were all people I had seen before . Easy lives in a neighborhood. &quot; The neighborhood is 103rd Street and Central Avenue in the area that later became known as Watts . Filming it as it was then has meant using other parts of the city that have undergone less change from urban decay , vandalism and supermarket make-overs . Some of the filming has been done closer to downtown , near Pico , with buildings and streets in the area doctored to eliminate anachronisms like parking meters . The producers had difficulty even locating many period photographs of Central Avenue to help them reconstruct its look . &quot; We asked everybody involved in the production if they had any_old family photos to bring them to us , &quot; said Jesse Beaton . &quot; This is difficult because it ' s period , &quot; Franklin said , comparing this to his last picture . &quot; It ' s a big film , there are a lot of characters , a lot of locations and it ' s all 1948 . And we want to do_it so that it ' s full of feeling and not just snippets of reality but big vistas . &quot; We ' re getting_it , we ' re getting_it good , and everybody ' s having a good time . Denzel has been real cool to work with . The problem with Denzel is he wants all your research . He ' s just so into it . I ask somebody , where ' s my research ? They say , ' Denzel ' s got it. ' &quot; When the cameras start rolling , Denzel Washington , dressed in 1940s suit and tie , makes his way across the spacious dark-paneled room that is actually the head of school ' s office at Mayfield but on this day is the headquarters of the Carter Foundation . Diego Rivera paintings hang_on the wall . Leather-bound volumes fill the bookcases . The air smells of money . Carter gets_up from his antique desk to greet Easy , whom events have transformed overnight from a lowly aircraft worker into an important black_man standing square-shouldered in an inner sanctum of white power . &quot; Look_at Denzel , &quot; said a member of the crew gathered behind cinematographer Tak Fujimoto ' s video monitor . &quot; that ' s actually a cheap suit he ' s wearing because that ' s what Easy would be able to afford , but on Denzel it looks GQ. &quot; This was true . &quot; Did something happen to Daphne ? &quot; Kinney asks . &quot; The last time I saw her she looked fine , &quot; Washington says . &quot; You saw her ? &quot; &quot; Yeah , last night. &quot; &quot; Is she still in town ? &quot; &quot; She was last night. &quot; &quot; What did she say , what was she wearing ? &quot; &quot; A blue dress and blue heels. &quot; &quot; You know , I ' ve never known a woman who could wear perfume so slight . . . . &quot; Just then Washington takes the measure of this needy millionaire and sees something sad and unexpected . It ' s that moment in a mystery when the hero gives a look that says , &quot; What have I gotten myself into ? &quot; Mosley , who had been looking_on , said , &quot; What genre is this that I ' m writing in ? It ' s harder to say than it seems . Because I ' m packaged as a mystery writer , but I ' m also writing_about the history of Los Angeles . I ' m writing_about black people in America. &quot; He has written three more books following the development of Easy Rawlins -- &quot; A Red Death , &quot; &quot; White Butterfly &quot; and the just-published &quot; Black Betty. &quot; He said he would rather be compared to Dickens . &quot; I ' m trying to write_about a social life , a linguistic life . I think the ( hard-boiled detective ) genre is about corruption . that ' s what Chandler was writing_about : the end of the European man . The sense that his world doesn ' t work anymore. &quot; Mosley seemed to be in a good mood during this film -- financed visit to his hometown , watching his literary creatures come_to_life in a $ 20-million studio feature . But he said he was not ready to move_back to the land of the palms . &quot; I enjoyed ' Boyz N the Hood ' and ' Menace II Society , ' but I think that Hollywood has brought a hip-hop sensibility to black experience that is not true. &quot; &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; presumably will be different ? &quot; My experience with Hollywood is very clean , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t have any expectations . I feel the way James M . Cain did when he was asked how he felt about what Hollywood had done to his novels . He said , ' My novels are right here on the shelf. ' &quot;</TEXT>
