   <HEADLINE> FOR CSUN , BIG WEST COULD BE IN FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reports that Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State might bolt the Big West Conference to join the Western Athletic Conference could boost Cal State Northridge ' s efforts to place its athletic program in an established alliance . Bob Hiegert , Northridge ' s athletic director , said this week that he has informally discussed the school ' s interest in joining the Big West with conference commissioner Dennis Farrell on &quot; a_couple_of occasions. &quot; &quot; Their posture all along has been that expansion is not part of their plans unless something drastic happened in terms of their membership , &quot; Hiegert said . The loss of UNLV and San Jose might be drastic enough . One of the reasons the Big West has been unwilling to accept Northridge is that the Matadors play football on the Division I-AA level rather than Division I-A . The Big West qualifies as a Division I-A conference in football , but with the loss of UNLV and San Jose , that designation is in jeopardy . Without UNLV and San Jose , the Big West would be left with only four football programs . Division I-A teams are required by the NCAA to play 70 % or more of their schedules against like opponents . The College Football Assn . suggests schools meet that requirement within their conference schedule , which would leave the Big West four teams short . Hiegert said he believes Northridge and the Big West would be &quot; a good fit. &quot; He also predicted , &quot; I think the Big West will be looking_at expansion a little differently at its next executive board_meeting in June. &quot; MIKE HISERMAN</TEXT>
