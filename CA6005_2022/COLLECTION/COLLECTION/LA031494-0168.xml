   <HEADLINE> CELLULAR PACT MAY NOT TRIGGER BUY-U.S. SPREE ; TRADE : JAPANESE ARE UNLIKELY TO RALLY AROUND AMERICAN PRODUCTS EVEN IF THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and Japan may have forged an agreement that will intensify competition in cellular communications along the crowded Tokyo-Nagoya corridor . But Americans shouldn ' t expect a big &quot; thank_you &quot; from Japanese consumers . In the latest trade dust-up between the two nations , it is Motorola and America that are the targets of Japanese wrath , not the companies that have been charging consumers rates four to five times those in the United States . &quot; Re-Emergence of Prewar Economic Blockade , &quot; and &quot; Down With Coercive U.S. Diplomacy &quot; were among the anti-American graffiti sprayed on the walls of Motorola ' s headquarters in downtown Tokyo earlier this month after America threatened to impose trade sanctions on Japan . Since the White_House threatened sanctions , &quot; all_of us have come_to hate America , &quot; said journalist Toshiaki Ohno of other Japanese reporters covering telecommunications . &quot; The role of Japanese consumers isn ' t to boost profits at American companies. &quot; The intensity of Japan ' s response to American pressure is a symptom of the economic nationalism that bubbles_up a little more fiercely here each time there is a trade dispute between the two economic powers . It also underscores the depth of the gulf that divides Japan from the West on just what constitutes free_trade and what Japan must do to open its economy . The agreement reached between the United States and Japan Saturday allows Motorola Inc. to compete on equal footing with Japanese companies in providing cellular_phone service in the heavily populated region stretching from Tokyo to Nagoya . Motorola had maintained that its local partner , Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp . ( IDO ) , had thwarted sales in the coveted , 155-mile corridor . Even so , an outbreak of American-style competition among cellular companies in Japan seems unlikely . Delays already have provided Japanese suppliers with the crucial lead time necessary to bring their costs in_line with Motorola ' s . And by the time IDO ' s Motorola network covers most of Tokyo 18 months from now , it will face additional competition from new companies offering digital services -- some of them beneficiaries of a new Japanese government low-interest loan program . In the meantime , the Japanese government is taking steps to prevent cellular_phone prices from falling too rapidly . And Japanese consumers are not ready to fight for lower prices if it means that increased competition will damage Japanese firms that employ family members and friends . The attitude of Tokyo businessman Asahio Goto is typical . &quot; We Japanese are sympathetic to NTT ( the national telephone monopoly ) because they have so many employees they have to support , &quot; he said . Though he would use a cellular_phone if prices fell , Goto is stoic about doing without the luxury : &quot; I make_do with a pager. &quot; Given the unchanging nature of Japanese institutions and attitudes through Japan ' s long effort to catch_up_with the West , some experts doubt the cellular_phone pact will change the Japanese marketplace very much . Japan expert Chalmers Johnson sees such concessions by the Japanese less as progress toward an open market than as a &quot; smoke_screen to buy_time , &quot; doing little to change the ways of the Japanese economy . America ' s hopes for genuine change in Japanese trade practices arose from the fall last July of the Liberal Democratic Party , one of the three sides of the iron triangle that has ruled the country for three decades . But the two other powers -- industry and bureaucracy -- have remained as an even more powerful iron axis that continues to favor industry interests over those of consumers and local producers over foreign producers . It is the bureaucrats who were up late trying to find ways to appease Motorola ' s demands . And it is the bureaucrats who will move the levers of the economy to try and lower Japan ' s attention-getting trade surpluses . That won ' t necessarily mean more American imports . One likely solution : shift the surpluses to Asia , countries by assembling more products in Southeast_Asia and China for re-export to America and the rest of the world . When Japan began offering cellular_phone service 14 years ago , it was bureaucrats in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications ( MPT ) who required that all phones be leased , enabling service providers to set high prices for phone rentals . Today , while American cellular providers subsidize the sale of phones to encourage their use -- allowing stores to sell them for as little as $ 50 -- Japanese companies rent the phones for $ 80 a month and more . Until recently , NTT even required consumers to pay a $ 952 deposit for each phone rented . During Japan ' s economic bubble in the late 1980s , cellular sales grew in spite of the high cost . Image was everything , and there was nothing quite as striking as being seen using a cellular_phone . When the economy dipped in 1991 , however , so too did growth . Under pressure from America and from reformers within Japan , the MPT agreed two years ago to allow cellular_phones to be purchased as of April 1 , 1994 . At the same time , two new cellular_phone carriers will be allowed to enter each market with new , digital technology that makes more efficient use of radio_waves than the Motorola-IDO analog system . In anticipation of the new competition , NTT dropped its deposit requirement in October , and cellular_phone carriers began cutting their prices . Lower prices immediately drove cellular_phone subscriptions up 200 % , triggering a wave of anxiety among Japan ' s cellular firms about &quot; prosperity without profit. &quot; Already , the Japanese government has taken steps to stabilize prices . When a company part owned by Pacific Telesis recently discounted some rates , MPT scolded the firm for acting in a way that might &quot; demoralize &quot; other dealers . Taihei Kurose , an official in MPT ' s Mobile Telecommunications division , said the agency acted to avoid &quot; market confusion. &quot; Explains Phua Lee Kerk , senior analyst at Baring Securities ( Japan ) Ltd. : &quot; Since they have been a protected market , cellular_phones are one of the few areas that have been generating cash . At U.S. price_levels , the Japanese companies can ' t survive. &quot; Even with the agreement between Tokyo and Washington , Motorola has cause to be suspicious of its Japanese partner . IDO is a consortium of such establishment-style companies as Toyota , Tokyo Electric and NEC . When it first began competing with NTT more_than a decade ago in providing cellular service , IDO chose to use NTT technology rather than Motorola ' s , a decision attributed to the influence of Japan ' s old_boy network . &quot; Toyota is the largest shareholder of IDO . They can ' t go_against NTT or it will start buying more of their cars from Nissan , &quot; said analyst Kerk . IDO later agreed to introduce Motorola technology , under pressure from the United States . Less aggressive and less successful than its counterpart in eastern Japan , the IDO system covers less than half of the Tokyo-Nagoya market . Consequently , Motorola has sold only 12 # 000 phones in the region . The new trade pact allows low-cost Motorola to more_than triple its capacity in Japan to 450 # 000 subscribers from about 150 # 000 . As Motorola moves to achieve that goal , it undoubtedly will encounter competition from upstart Japanese equipment-makers funded with special low-interest loans designed to encourage domestic production of cellular_phones . Last month , for example , the MPT initiated a program that would allow any company investing in cellular_phone production facilities to borrow up_to 40 % of the investment costs from the Japan Development Bank , a quasi-government institution , at interest_rates as low as 3.5 % . Although government officials are periodically introducing new measures they say will stimulate the economy and boost imports , measures such_as these could have the effect of discouraging imports . Currently , many of the cellular_phones Japanese companies sell overseas are made in America using American components . The MPT said it wants to encourage Japanese manufacturers to take_advantage of recent market liberalization to boost production . An official said Japanese subsidiaries of American companies would have access to the loans if they were willing to set_up manufacturing facilities in Japan .</TEXT>
