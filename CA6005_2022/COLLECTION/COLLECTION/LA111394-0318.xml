   <HEADLINE> 1 MILLION CONVERGE ON ROME TO PROTEST CUTBACKS ; ITALY : IN THE CITY ' S LARGEST DEMONSTRATION SINCE WWII , MARCHERS OPPOSE PLAN TO SLASH PENSIONS , SOCIAL_SERVICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Factory_worker Eduardo Fumagalli rode all night on a train to help deliver a message that rolled like thunder -- 1 million voices strong -- over a swollen , partisan Rome on Saturday . &quot; We are here to explain that something is wrong . A rich_man ' s government is stealing from the poor , &quot; said Fumagalli , a 48-year-old woodworker from the northern city of Lecco . In what organizers called the largest street demonstration in Rome since World_War_II , labor_unions delivered a stinging rebuttal to plans by billionaire Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi to slash pensions and social_services . It was worker against government , left against right , in the latest round of labor counterattack against belt-tightening by Berlusconi ' s young , conservative government . Workers flocked to Rome for spirited , peaceful protests that overflowed three of the Eternal City ' s most historic public spaces in simultaneous demonstrations -- the Piazza del Popolo , the Circus Maximus and the giant piazza before the basilica of St . John Lateran . &quot; The new budget restricts pensions , health_care and funds for the development of the south . All the cuts are against those Italians who have the least , &quot; complained Fausto Pastori , a 45-year-old valve maker from Legnano , near Milan . In Circus Maximus , the amphitheater where chariots_raced in Roman times , skyscraper cranes dangled giant loudspeakers broadcasting labor ' s outrage across a vast , colorful and good-natured crowd gathered under the flags of unions and left-wing political_parties . &quot; We will not have it ! &quot; screamed a giant banner on the podium where speakers railed against Berlusconi ' s proposed 1995 budget_cuts of $ 33 billion , which would reduce the government deficit by one-third . Berlusconi says he will demand parliamentary approval of the budget in a vote_of_confidence Monday . &quot; You can ' t change the numbers , not with one strike or with 10 strikes . The numbers are there . I found them ; I didn ' t produce them , &quot; Berlusconi told reporters during a nationwide general strike last month that set the stage for Saturday ' s protest . On a cloudless autumn day with just enough breeze to set flags and banners snapping , police agreed with organizers that the three Rome demonstrations drew more_than 1 million people . The atmosphere was festive , but it masked a swelling sense of alarm among Italian workers watching the dismantlement of one of Europe ' s most comprehensive social safety nets . There have been strikes all autumn -- with more to come . &quot; I started work_at 14 with the promise that I could retire after 35 years with a decent pension . The promise is broken and they say I should buy a private pension . Even if I had the money , where would I get one -- from one of Berlusconi ' s insurance_companies ? &quot; asked Mario Lafela , 44 , a metalworker from Milan who brought his wife and teen-age daughters to demonstrate with him . Cabinet spokesman Giuliano Ferrara told Italian television that the disputed budget is &quot; in the interest of future generations &quot; and said Saturday ' s demonstration had turned_into a generalized anti-government protest . Berlusconi , a political rookie , sprang to power last spring from the ashes of a political Establishment destroyed by a corruption scandal . Attempting to balance the books -- government debt equals a staggering 123 % of last year ' s gross_national_product -- Berlusconi has attacked social programs that were sacred_cows for nearly half a century . The new budget proposes spending_cuts in education , defense , scientific_research and health_care , but the biggest cutbacks target a generous pension system often scored for its corruption .</TEXT>
