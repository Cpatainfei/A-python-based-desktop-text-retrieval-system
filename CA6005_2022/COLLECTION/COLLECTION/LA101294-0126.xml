   <HEADLINE> MEXICO REBELS HALT PEACE TALKS , DEFY GOVERNMENT ; LATIN_AMERICA : SALINAS SEEKS TO DEFUSE DISPUTE WITH ZAPATISTAS AMID FEARS OF RENEWED FIGHTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The threat of renewed armed conflict loomed over this crisis-ridden nation Tuesday after Indian rebels in the southern state of Chiapas broke_off peace talks with the government , mined roads to their jungle strongholds and said they had put_up antiaircraft batteries to challenge the Mexican air_force . President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s government tried to defuse the conflict , renewing orders to the Mexican armed forces to fire only if fired upon by the rebels and launching a peace offensive that offered the Zapatista National Liberation Army new concessions . But Roman_Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz , who has acted_as an intermediary in the nine months since the Zapatistas suspended a bloody insurrection that left more_than 145 dead in the impoverished southern state in January , warned both sides that the showdown has &quot; a transcendental gravity. &quot; Analysts voiced concern that the Zapatistas , whose populist crusade for minority rights in Chiapas and throughout the south has been pushed to the margins by two recent political assassinations , escalating drug-related violence and deepening fears for personal safety , are preparing_for a last , desperate act of war . &quot; They are trying to bring themselves back to life , &quot; said Homero Aridjis , a writer and social critic . &quot; There is a real danger that the fighting will resume , given the climate of violence that has overtaken the nation , the bloody surrealism that we are living. &quot; In a 10-point communique signed by Subcommander Marcos , the Zapatistas ' black-masked leader , the group asserted that Mexican government forces were preparing_for combat -- reinforcing positions around Zapatista-controlled towns , buzzing rebel positions with fighter planes and &quot; ostensibly preparing_for . . . an imminent attack. &quot; Marcos accused Salinas ' government of &quot; deception &quot; and operating &quot; a criminal political culture &quot; that lacks a genuine will to resolve the grievances that the Zapatistas and dozens of civilian activist groups supporting them say were behind the January uprising . &quot; Therefore , to respond to the provocations . . . Zapatista troops have completed mining all land access to rebel territory and already have installed antiaircraft units , &quot; the rebels said . There were no details or confirmation on how the poor , guerrilla force had acquired such heavy_weapons as antiaircraft_guns . &quot; We are ready , &quot; Marcos declared , adding , &quot; The Zapatista National Liberation Army will not renew talks for a political solution to the conflict. &quot; Responding to the latest in a series of crises that have marred his final year in office , Salinas denied that the Mexican army has plans for a military offensive . He called_for immediate , direct talks with the Zapatista leaders . The government also ordered the creation of an independent Truth Commission to address the Zapatistas ' grievances in the months since the government declared a unilateral cease-fire after launching a series of military offensives to put_down the insurrection . &quot; It is necessary to declare that the army has orders not to take any offensive military_action and only to fire in self-defense if attacked , &quot; the government declared in its communique late Monday night . &quot; This instruction will be complied with immediately. &quot; Shortly after the uprising began , a similar government peace effort quickly thwarted the growing support that the Zapatistas had enjoyed throughout Mexico . &quot; The revolutionary mood of the country quickly evaporated , &quot; Aridjis said . &quot; They are not likely to regain support from the rest of the country. &quot; Besides revulsion at violence stemming from the political assassinations this year after decades of stability , he said , Mexicans are growing skeptical about the rebels . &quot; The public is accustomed to empty threats from the Zapatistas , &quot; he said . For example , they threatened violence if they did not like the outcome of the Aug . 21 presidential election but did not return to arms then . But Aridjis added that the months between the presidential election and the inauguration -- scheduled for Dec . 1 -- are traditionally a period of instability . That increases concern about the possible effects of a return to fighting in the south , especially considering other recent violence here . The renewed confrontation with the Zapatistas came as the government and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party were still reeling from the second assassination of a key political_leader in seven months . Just hours after the Zapatistas issued the thinly veiled declaration of war , prosecutors attempting to untangle a conspiracy behind last month ' s assassination of the PRI ' s second-ranking official arrested a legislative aide suspected of helping mastermind the plot . Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez -- a technical secretary to a fugitive federal legislator also suspected in the plot in which Francisco Ruiz Massieu was killed -- was taken into custody late Monday by federal police in the Mexican state of Zacatecas . Authorities said they were continuing their manhunt -- backed by a $ 1-million reward -- for Manuel Munoz Rocha , Rodriguez Gonzalez ' s boss and a ruling-party legislator who was reported to be in hiding in northern Mexico or in Texas . Unlike the investigation into the Tijuana assassination in March of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- the ruling party candidate who had been expected to succeed Salinas -- the probe into Ruiz Massieu ' s slaying outside a downtown Mexico_City hotel has grown far beyond a single , crazed gunman . It is now suspected to be a conspiracy that may reach to the highest levels of the Mexican government and the party that has run it for 65 years ; 10 suspects have been arrested since security agents at the murder scene tackled Daniel Aguilar Trevino , who later said he was paid $ 15 # 000 to kill the ruling-party official . The latest assassination investigation , headed by the victim ' s brother , has exposed a web of intrigue . Assistant Atty . Gen . Mario Ruiz Massieu has said it involves either political vendettas between the party ' s reform factions and its Old_Guard or political infiltration by Mexico ' s powerful drug gangs -- or a combination of the two . Against the backdrop of continuing political violence within a party that narrowly won August ' s presidential and legislative elections on traditional promises of stability and security , the showdown with the Zapatistas served only to fuel national insecurity .</TEXT>
