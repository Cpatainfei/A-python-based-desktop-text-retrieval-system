   <TEXT> Saudi_Arabia Slashes Public Spending : Saudi_Arabia , the world ' s largest exporter of crude_oil , has announced it will cut public spending in 1994 to make_up for losses in revenue caused by weakening crude prices . King Fahd projected government spending in 1994 at $ 42.6 billion , down from $ 52.5 billion set for 1993. &quot; The world economic_conditions and surplus oil supplies have affected prices and imports from our country , so the ( oil ) prices dropped , &quot; Fahd said . &quot; We expect the situation to change in the not-too-distant future if all ( oil ) producers sincerely cooperate , which we hope will be attained. &quot; That was a clear reference_to an offer by Saudi_Arabia and its five partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council to lower their oil output if other oil-producing nations did the same . The GCC nations are Saudi_Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , the United Arab Emirates , Oman and Bahrain .</TEXT>
