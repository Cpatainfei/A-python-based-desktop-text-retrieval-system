   <HEADLINE> SENIORS FEARFUL OF LOSING RIDES ; TRANSPORTATION : POPULAR DIAL-A-RIDE PROGRAM IS FACING CUTBACKS . THE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR A TRANSIT SERVICE FOR THE DISABLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an emotional meeting that pitted two vulnerable groups against each other , local transportation officials heard testimony Monday on a plan to eliminate some of the county ' s Dial-A-Ride program for seniors while maintaining a similar program for disabled riders . Several dozen elderly and handicapped_persons crowded inside the Orange County Transportation Authority hearing room , where speakers expressed outrage over the proposal , arguing it is unfair to pit the disabled against seniors in a battle for scarce budget dollars . At issue is the transportation agency ' s plan to phase_out most of its popular Dial-A-Ride program by Sept . 11 so it can fund a federally mandated transportation program for disabled riders . Transit officials call the agency ' s program for handicapped riders ACCESS service . The dispute has it roots in the Americans With Disabilities Act , approved in 1990 by Congress . It requires local transportation agencies to facilitate use of mass transit by the disabled , though the federal mandate came without any funding . At Monday ' s public hearing , frustrated agency board_members said there is not enough money to pay_for both programs . The board will decide the future of the 20-year-old Dial-A-Ride May 23 . Under the proposal , Dial-A-Ride for individuals -- where a single person can call_for same-day transportation -- would be ended . The program would be retained for groups . &quot; The federal_government passes a law but doesn ' t write a check , &quot; said board_member and San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Gary L . Hausdorfer . &quot; We have a federal mandate to solve a problem with limited funds. &quot; Avondle Sharum , who represented a senior services center in Santa Ana , said she was &quot; appalled &quot; by the proposal to end one program in_order to save another . &quot; Disabled persons are now pitted against seniors , &quot; she said . Her comment was echoed by Nora Webb , director of the Roger Senior Center in Huntington Beach , who said it is &quot; a most horrendous thing pitting the two groups against one another. &quot; Several of the 50 speakers who addressed the board during a three-hour meeting expressed the same sentiment . Individual Dial-A-Ride accounts_for about 300 # 000 riders annually and costs the agency $ 5 million , according to OCTA figures . The fare is 90 cents each way per transportation zone , and the program is available to people 65 or older and some persons with disabilities . Group Dial-A-Ride services 950 # 000 riders a year and costs $ 2.2 million . ACCESS would cost about $ 4.5 million annually and would serve some 250 # 000 riders . The fare is $ 1.50 each way . OCTA expects about 4 # 500 people to qualify for the ACCESS program by the end of June . In order to qualify , riders have to prove they have a disability that precludes them from riding a regular bus . According to agency figures , Dial-A-Ride service is subsidized at $ 16 per trip , while ACCESS is subsidized at $ 22 each trip . By comparison , riders on fixed bus_routes are subsidized at $ 1.55 per trip . Both Dial-A-Ride and ACCESS provide door-to-door service . But while Dial-A-Ride offers same-day service , ACCESS currently requires 48-hour notice . Officials hope to reduce that to 24 hours by the end of the year . At the hearing , several seniors said that Dial-A-Ride is the difference in their lives between independence and being a shut-in . The program enables them to travel_to the grocery , bank and doctor without having to impose on friends or family , they said . Marilyn Ditty , executive_director of San Clemente Seniors , Inc. , expressed doubt that the agency would be able to phase_out Dial-A-Ride by September without &quot; disenfranchising an entire group of people. &quot; &quot; They don ' t have a system in place to phase it out so quickly . Seniors are still very transit dependent and OCTA doesn ' t have a system in place to make the transition orderly . We ' re seeing a panic among many seniors who are afraid they are losing their independence come September. &quot; The agency has no plans now to offer an alternative service , officials said . Ditty and other speakers asked the board to delay at least 18 months before phasing_out the taxi service . By that time , the transportation agency could devise an alternative plan to accommodate seniors , they said . While eliminating the program could cut some costs for the transit authority , it could also drive_up costs for other agencies that serve senior_citizens , Ditty said . &quot; If their transportation is cut_off , you ' re going to have more homebound seniors , &quot; Ditty said . &quot; This means that we ' re going to have to bring services to them , like delivering meals to their homes . Nobody has the money to pay_for these services. &quot; The transit agency has until January , 1997 , to comply with the federal law , but the agency is pushing to have it implemented by January , 1995 . Transit officials said the demand from the disabled for the federally mandated program is growing at such a rapid pace that it is necessary to speed_up its implementation to maintain quality service .</TEXT>
