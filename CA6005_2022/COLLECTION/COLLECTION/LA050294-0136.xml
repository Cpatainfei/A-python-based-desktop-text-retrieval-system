   <HEADLINE> NO ROOM FOR ANGER , MANDELA DECLARES ; SOUTH_AFRICA : THE FORMER REVOLUTIONARY IS_ON THE VERGE OF LEADING AFRICA ' S RICHEST NATION . LIFE HAS TAUGHT HIM TO TREAT OTHERS WITH RESPECT , HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He has gone from herd-boy to president-in-waiting , from revolutionary firebrand to elder_statesman , from political_prisoner to a political_leader about to assume power in Africa ' s richest nation . But perhaps the most remarkable and perplexing transformation of 75-year-old Nelson Mandela has been a more personal one . For despite 27 years in prison , most of it cut_off from his family and the world in a dank seven-foot-long cell , he is not angry , bitter or vengeful . In an hourlong interview Sunday , as the ballots were being counted that almost certainly will make him the country ' s first black president , the leader of the African National Congress looked deep into his past to explain why -- and gave rare insights into how he will govern South_Africa for the next five years . &quot; I would like to be angry , and choke somebody for all_the wrong things he has done , &quot; Mandela said . &quot; But to be able to be angry , you must have the opportunity to be angry. &quot; And he never had that luxury when , as a young black lawyer in the 1950s , he fought the brutal indignities of apartheid . His most difficult cases involved the insidious and now-abandoned system of pass laws , which severely restricted where blacks could live and work in the white-run society . &quot; An ordinary clerk in a pass office could change the life of a ( black ) man by saying ( he ) had no right to live_in Johannesburg , &quot; Mandela explained . &quot; That man loses his job , his house . His children who are at school , their future is blighted . You can ' t go_to court , because the law is clear . That little clerk , at a desk in a pass office , has got the power to change the life and the future of that man. &quot; So each time , rather than fighting the system head on , Mandela would go_to the chief pass officer , the clerk ' s supervisor , and say , &quot; Look , here is the situation , it ' s a tragedy for this family. ' . . . Invariably , these leading officials , when you approach them , are touched by human considerations and reverse the decision of the clerk. &quot; Similarly , when he was charged with sabotage , a capital crime equal_to treason under South_African law , and put_on trial for 4 1 / 2 years that ended in the early 1960s , Mandela clearly remembers the &quot; marvelous &quot; cooperation of the legal authorities , who allowed him to keep his legal practice going . &quot; Because the case would be heard from 9 o ' clock to 1 o ' clock , and the afternoon would be free , I was able to arrange with the chief magistrate that all cases in which I was involved should be in the afternoon . And they met me in this regard , prosecutors , policemen and magistrates. &quot; The lesson , Mandela said , was &quot; people respond in_relation_to how you treat them . If you treat them with respect , and ignore the negative aspects , you get a positive reaction . So even before I went_to jail for 27 years , I could not afford to be bitter. &quot; That is a lesson Mandela carries into the halls of power in South_Africa , where he will oversee a country in desperate need of reconciliation and reconstruction after more_than three centuries of white rule and four decades of the brutal segregation of apartheid . He is a man of unfailing grace and dignity , which has endeared him to whites as well as blacks . And he has rock-hard principles , as his willingness to sacrifice his freedom showed . But he is also a pragmatist who knows how to meet his opponents halfway . All those qualities will be crucial as he tries to heal a nation so torn by violence and racial hatred . Unseen and unheard while in jail , Mandela still became a figure of mythic proportions , an inspiration and rallying cry_for the black masses . And since he was released from prison in February , 1990 , he has earned the respect , if not necessarily the vote , of everyone from conservative whites to once-wary business_leaders to President Frederik W . de Klerk himself . That , in fact , is Mandela ' s most important asset . Probably more_than any other leader in the nation ' s history , he has won the confidence and trust of millions of people , from the black ghettos to the white corporate suites . Even now , his time in jail remains the defining period in Mandela ' s life and a large source of his worldwide support . While in prison , the lesson -- to treat people with respect -- was even more important . He and his fellow black political_prisoners on Robben Island , the desolate island prison off Cape_Town , immediately decided to befriend the white warders in_charge of their cells -- &quot; because the big chaps can only persecute you through the warders in your section , &quot; he explained Sunday . &quot; If you say to the commissioner , or the minister of justice , I want three blankets , he looks_at the regulations and just says , ' Well , the regulation says two blankets. ' &quot; Mandela said . &quot; But if you talk to the ordinary warder in your passage , and you say I want three blankets , he just goes_to the storeroom and takes_out an extra blanket and gives it to you . So you learn how to work with the people put_in charge of you. &quot; Once , when Mandela and his colleagues were walking slowly back to their cells from a long day of crushing rocks in the quarry , the prison ' s ambitious second-in-command barked out orders for the warders &quot; to push us. &quot; &quot; They refused , &quot; Mandela said , &quot; because they respected us . . . . We helped them . Drafted letters for them . So they appreciated our friendship . . . . So it became difficult to have any recriminations. &quot; Mandela decided it was smarter to understand his enemies rather than curse them . So while in prison , he learned Afrikaans , the language used by the white rulers . And soon after his release , Mandela won the hearts of many Afrikaners by speaking their language when making speeches to them . &quot; If you speak a man ' s language , &quot; Mandela explained , &quot; it goes straight to his heart and his blood. &quot; During his later years in prison , white warders routinely referred to him as &quot; Mr. Mandela , &quot; a term of respect used for no other prisoners . To this day , Mandela regularly talks by phone with his former prison warders , and he has invited two of the warders he knew best to the presidential inauguration in Pretoria on May 10 . Mandela ' s time in prison left other marks . He still gets_up before dawn and makes his own bed . And he has built a vacation house that is an exact replica of the three-bedroom warder ' s house where he spent his last two years in prison . Mandela said only that it is easier to find his way in the dark in a house he knows . His own family home was in the rolling hills of the Transkei . Born in Qunu in 1918 , Mandela was the eldest son of a chief of the Xhosa-speaking Thembu people in Transkei . His given name , Rolihlahla , was prophetic : it means &quot; stirring_up trouble. &quot; He was raised with the self-assurance of African royalty in the household of the Thembus ' paramount chief . To outsiders , the cluster of whitewashed huts by the Mbashe River was dirt-poor . To Mandela , it was a land of riches . &quot; I listened to the elders of the tribe as they related stories of the old days when we ran our own country , governed ourselves , and the heroes that we had when there was a conflict between white and black , &quot; he said . Once in office , Mandela said he will resume the popular &quot; people ' s forums &quot; he used in his presidential campaign . In dozens of public sessions , voters brought their troubles and questions to him . Each time , he listened patiently , and then responded with advice or admonitions . It is similar to how traditional chiefs operated when he grew_up . Mandela studied at South_Africa ' s Ft . Hare University , where other leaders of independent black_Africa have studied , and was suspended for helping organize a student strike . Still , he said he aspired to be a chief until the fateful day when the paramount chief , his guardian , attempted &quot; a forced marriage and I ran_away from home . And I got under the influence of radicals . . . and I then forgot about chieftaincy. &quot; A striking , athletic man , he went_to Johannesburg in 1941 . He worked as a mine policeman and clerk , and studied at the University of the Witwatersrand . He became apprenticed to a white law_firm before he established his own practice . In 1944 , Mandela joined the ANC , and with other young_men turned it from petitions for redress of blacks ' grievances to protests on a broader scale . When the National Party came_to power in 1948 and began to impose apartheid , the congress launched renewed campaigns of civil_disobedience . Mandela was at first given a suspended sentence for violating the country ' s security laws , then was silenced and curbed in his movements by a government &quot; banning &quot; order . Later , he was detained along with 155 others , charged with treason and , after a trial that ended in 1961 , acquitted along with the other defendants . But it was not long before he was in jail on other charges . In 1964 , he was sentenced to life in prison on charges of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government . The ANC was outlawed amid protests that followed the fatal police massacre on March , 1960 , of 69 unarmed blacks protesting pass laws at Sharpeville . After that , it turned_to sabotage . Mandela was a key figure in this shift , drawing_up plans to establish the congress underground and becoming the first commander of its military wing . The goal was to disrupt the economy and scare_away capital . But to avoid loss of life , terrorism and guerrilla war were ruled_out at the time . Slipping across the border , Mandela visited Ethiopia , Algeria and other African_countries , arranging military_training for ANC members . His secret return to South_Africa and his daredevil underground existence earned him the title of the &quot; Black Pimpernel &quot; and added_to his romantic image among blacks . His own romantic life is more tragic . He separated from his wife , Winnie , after more_than three decades in April , 1992 . In the interview , he said he has no plans to get_back together . But he did not seem especially upset at a recent threat by her to lead her ardent supporters into the streets if his government does not deliver on its promises for social change and economic justice . &quot; If the ANC fails to deliver , there is no reason for it to stay in power , &quot; he said . &quot; And the people would be justified in throwing it out. &quot; * ANC HEADS FOR VICTORY : The latest vote tally gives Mandela ' s party 53 % .
