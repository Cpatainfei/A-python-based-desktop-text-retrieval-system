   <HEADLINE> TOUGH ON CRIME , MURKY ON GENOCIDE ; BOSNIA : THE LACK OF U.S. LEADERSHIP IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE ; HOW MANY ' STRIKES ' WILL CLINTON GIVE BEFORE THE SERBS ARE ' OUT ' ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perhaps it is because I come from a country that benefited from so_much international solidarity when our Solidarity movement was in_trouble that I ' m puzzled by the lack of support for the Bosnians . After all , our fight was merely for freedom and democracy ; the Bosnians ' fight is for life as well . I ask myself why there is no mobilization of public_opinion , why demonstrations in U.S. cities draw so few people to the streets , why there are no 800 numbers on TV networks indicating where blood donations and monetary contributions should go , why American hospitals do not rush with offers of free treatment for the wounded , why there is no plan for accepting Bosnian refugees . I know that Americans are capable of showing compassion , so I am surprised at their passivity this time . Yes , it was easier to show solidarity with Poles who fought by nonviolent means , but Polish communism was relatively nonviolent , too ( the death toll for the whole period of martial_law was roughly equal_to the daily toll in Sarajevo ) . Yes , the struggle between communism and democracy in Poland was easier to understand ; but in Bosnia the choice is between a secular , multiethnic and multicultural state on the one side and an ethnically cleansed and mentally brainwashed totalitarian dictatorship on the other . The choice should be equally easy . But because the American people are constantly misinformed , they see the issue as muddy . It is not the facts that are murky -- the media have done an excellent job in providing daily news from this hell -- it is the U.S._government ' s interpretation . Perhaps this is done on purpose ? Perhaps it is meant to be muddy ? Why otherwise would the Administration continue to describe aggressors and victims alike as &quot; warring sides &quot; ( recently the words civil_war were introduced by the White_House ) . Sadly , President Clinton , instead of correcting this misinterpretation , adds offense to injury . &quot; Until those folks get tired_of killing each other over there , bad things will continue to happen , &quot; he declared after the slaughter in Sarajevo ' s market . I guess if President Clinton had been around during the 1943 uprising in the Warsaw ghetto , he would also have called it &quot; those folks out there killing each other &quot; ( some Jewish combatants , though crudely and sparsely armed , managed to inflict casualties on the Nazis ) . How would he describe the brief armed rebellion in the Treblinka concentration_camp ? But President Clinton does know how to be tough . He has , for instance , supported a stern domestic stance against crime . But isn ' t genocide a crime ? Is it merely a &quot; bad thing &quot; ? He declared war on repeat felony offenders with &quot; three strikes and you ' re out. &quot; How many strikes does he give the Bosnian Serbs and their recidivist leader , Radovan Karadzic ? True , there is not overwhelming public support for action in Bosnia . A CNN / USA Today poll conducted after the Sarajevo marketplace carnage shows 48 % of Americans favoring air strikes and 43 % opposing them . But considering that the Clinton_Administration ' s main policy on Bosnia is to keep it out of the headlines as long as possible , 48 % is a surprisingly high level of support . Bosnia was mentioned only once , in passing , in the State of the Union address ; Clinton chose not to quote from any letter he got_about the atrocities ; he did not invite the editor of the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje ( who was in Washington that day ) to sit in the gallery , although that newspaper is certainly a perfect example of nonviolent resistance . The mortar attack on the market , which took 68 lives , was downgraded in State_Department descriptions from the worst atrocity of the war to &quot; no more horrible or less horrible &quot; than other attacks . Instead of trying to galvanize public support for a tough stance , the President is desperately looking_for excuses to do nothing . All forms of inaction have been tried , but action has not . Perhaps this time it will be . According to the same opinion poll , 65 % of Americans would support Clinton if he did use air strikes . By acting , by keeping his word , he would also save some of his credibility abroad . It may come_in_handy when confronting other warlords and naughty boys of this world . North_Korea ' s Kim Il Sung , Haiti ' s Raoul Cedras , Russia ' s Vladimir Zhirinovsky , Iraq ' s Saddam Hussein and Somalia ' s Mohammed Farah Aidid can all sit in front of their televisions and watch , live , President Clinton ' s handling of the Serbian warlord . So far , they ' ve sighed with relief and proceeded with their plans . My own Gen . Wojciech Jaruzelski watches too , wishing he had had it so easy .</TEXT>
