   <HEADLINE> PLAN TO COUNT IMMIGRANTS IN SCHOOLS FAILS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Capping a highly emotional debate in which the specter of Nazi Germany was raised by angry Democrats , the House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to defeat a proposal to require public_schools to document the number of illegal immigrants in their classrooms . A narrow majority of Republicans joined with Democrats to kill the legislation sponsored by Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) by a decisive 329-78 vote . Offered as an amendment to a $ 12.4-billion education projects bill , Rohrabacher ' s proposal would have required schools receiving federal funds to provide the Department_of_Education with enrollment figures for both their undocumented immigrant students and for lawfully resident pupils whose parents are in the United States illegally . Arguing that the nation can no longer afford &quot; to spend billions of dollars providing free education to people who are here illegally , &quot; Rohrabacher said his amendment would have allowed state and federal authorities to calculate the costs that illegal immigration imposes on the educational system in the United States . In California and elsewhere , &quot; the flood of illegal aliens is breaking the bank . . . and we have to get control of it , &quot; Rohrabacher argued . &quot; It is essential for Congress to know how much it is costing to educate illegal aliens. &quot; But while most lawmakers acknowledged that illegal immigration is a serious problem , they also agreed with Majority_Leader Richard Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) that it made no sense &quot; to turn every school official in this country into an immigration officer , &quot; burdening educators with bureaucratic responsibilities &quot; that are no part of their jobs. &quot; &quot; We don ' t believe it ' s right to have little children in public_schools enlisted to be spies against their parents , &quot; said Rep . William Ford ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee . Although the outcome was never in doubt , the vehemence with which Democrats rose to attack the proposal inflamed tempers as the debate quickly degenerated into a shouting match filled with emotional allusions to Nazi Germany and accusations of racism . Pounding the podium with his fist , Rep . Neil Abercrombie ( D-Hawaii ) , denounced the amendment as &quot; a contemporary ' Schindler ' s List. ' &quot; It was &quot; insane &quot; even to suggest the amendment given &quot; what we learned about Nazi Germany in the period before World_War_II , &quot; Ford added . &quot; This amendment , &quot; thundered Rep . John Lewis ( D-Ga. ) , &quot; was conceived in darkness and born of intolerance and division. &quot; Rohrabacher said afterward that he was upset by tone of the rhetoric used against him . &quot; If I were ever to even suggest that someone had communist sympathies because he opposed something I was pushing , the reaction ( in Congress ) would be outrage . . . . Yet we have to sit there for hours listening to people calling us Nazis because they oppose doing anything about this issue , &quot; he said . &quot; To say we can ' t take_care of everybody is not being mean spirited , &quot; Rohrabacher added . &quot; We just don ' t have the money to provide free education and other services to everybody in the world who comes here illegally. &quot;</TEXT>
