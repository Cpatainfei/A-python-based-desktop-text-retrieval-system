   <HEADLINE> PRIVATE LIVES ; VIDEO ; A HORROR FANATIC ' S SPREE DE CORPSE ; WE ASKED ROCKER AND COMPOSER DANNY ELFMAN , CREATOR OF CREEPY MUSIC FOR COOL FILMS , TO PICK THE BEST MOVIES TO RENT FOR HALLOWEEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ' You realize what you ' re ask ing me to do is next to impossible , &quot; Danny Elfman says when asked to name his 10 favorite movies to rent on Halloween . &quot; I ' m a horror fanatic of major proportions. &quot; Elfman , 41 , who leads a dual life as the singer-songwriter of the Los Angeles band Boingo and the composer of scores for such films as &quot; Edward Scissorhands , &quot; &quot; Beetlejuice &quot; and both &quot; Batman &quot; movies , is somewhat of an expert on horror films , and he thinks Halloween ' s a good time to watch them . One good bet this year , he says , is &quot; Tim Burton ' s Nightmare Before Christmas , &quot; which was recently released on video . Elfman wrote the Grammy-nominated music for the stop-motion animated film and also provided the singing voice of Jack Skellington , the bony Pumpkin King . &quot; I think anyone who might be into the movie would enjoy it on Halloween , &quot; Elfman says . &quot; Of course , I ' m biased. &quot; Elfman himself rarely gets the chance to rent movies on All Hallow ' s Eve -- he ' s busy putting_on Boingo ' s almost-annual Halloween concerts ( for seven of the last eight years ) . This year ' s shows are at the Universal Amphitheatre tonight , Monday ( both sold_out ) and Tuesday ( tickets available through Ticketmaster ) . But for those more inclined to stay home and rent than go_out and rock , here are Elfman ' s favorite flicks for Halloween . He couldn ' t limit it to 10 , though . Here are the lucky 13 , which , he says , &quot; are all worth searching out &quot; : 1 . &quot; The Shining &quot; ( 1980 ) . &quot; That falls_into the adult category , &quot; Elfman says of director Stanley Kubrick ' s film of the Stephen King novel . &quot; It ' s one of the best done of its genre . . . . And , of course , I love it because ( the twin girls ) are saying , ' Hello , Danny , ' so they ' re talking to me . ' Come play with us forever and ever , ' and I ' m always going , ' Uh , OK. ' &quot; 2 . &quot; The Haunting &quot; ( 1963 ) . Elfman enjoys watching this chilling haunted house film because it ' s a &quot; classic ghost movie &quot; that director Robert Wise made all_the more powerful by the absence of on-screen spirits . &quot; It ' s very imaginative the way they put it together , making a scary movie without ever showing any prosthetic makeup or scary images in your face . ( that ' s ) kind of a hard thing to do. &quot; 3 . &quot; The Beast With Five Fingers &quot; ( 1946 ) . This tale about an aging pianist was the film that scared Elfman most -- he was 7 when he first saw it . &quot; It ' s silly , but it ' s really fun , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a classic Peter Lorre performance. &quot; 4 . ( Tie ) &quot; Evil Dead II &quot; ( 1987 ) and &quot; Dawn of the Dead &quot; ( 1978 ) . &quot; Both of these movies make me laugh so hard while I ' m enjoying them , as gore often does , &quot; Elfman says of these funny gross-out flicks . &quot; There ' s something about malls and flesh-eating zombies . Getting disemboweled by zombies in a mall is classic stuff. &quot; 5 . &quot; Bride of Frankenstein &quot; ( 1935 ) . Elfman calls this classic &quot; one of the original great horror movies , &quot; partly because of its Franz Waxman musical_score , which he ranks alongside the score to &quot; King Kong &quot; as one of the best -- and earliest -- scores ever written . &quot; ( But ) ' King Kong ' doesn ' t rank up with ' Bride of Frankenstein ' for Halloween , &quot; he says . 6 . ( Tie ) &quot; Tales of Terror &quot; ( 1962 ) and &quot; The Raven &quot; ( 1963 ) . These Roger Corman-directed movies that featured Vincent Price and Peter Lorre &quot; were my best-loved movies somewhere between the ages of 10 and 13 , &quot; Elfman says . &quot; They ' re still fantastic . They ' re fun. &quot; 7 . &quot; Black Sabbath &quot; ( 1964 ) . This three-part horror film hosted by Boris Karloff is an Elfman favorite mostly because of the middle story directed by Mario Bava . &quot; It ' s a really scary half-hour piece , &quot; Elfman says . &quot; The other stories are OK , but this one ' s a classic. &quot; 8 . ( Tie ) &quot; The Brain That would n ' t Die &quot; ( 1963 ) and &quot; Eyes Without a Face &quot; ( 1959 ) ( also known as &quot; The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus &quot; ) . These low-budget horror flicks revolving around crazed surgeons tie as Elfman favorites in the &quot; low-budget films of my youth &quot; category . &quot; Great , cheesy ( movies ) , &quot; he says . &quot; They can ' t be beat. &quot; 9 . &quot; Repulsion &quot; ( 1965 ) . &quot; Now we ' re moving into the Danny Elfman , young teen-age auteur ( category ) , &quot; he says of this unsettling film directed by Roman Polanski . &quot; This is a perennial favorite . One of my teen-age birthday_parties was spent getting very ( messed ) up , seeing ' Repulsion ' and returning home for a rabbit dinner . If you see the movie you ' ll know why. &quot; 10 . &quot; Eraserhead &quot; ( 1978 ) . &quot; It ' s just one of the best films ever made , &quot; Elfman says of this David Lynch-directed cult favorite . &quot; I think it ' s got enough tie-in with Halloween . . . . There was nothing about it I didn ' t like . It ' s just filled with great imagery. &quot; * * Titles not available at neighborhood or chain_stores can be rented at Vidiots , 302 Pico Blvd. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 392-8508 , or found through Movies Unlimited , ( 800 ) 523-0823 .</TEXT>
