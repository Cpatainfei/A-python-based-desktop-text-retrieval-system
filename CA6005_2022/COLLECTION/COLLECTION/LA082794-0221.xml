   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : MISSION HILLS ; DIET PROGRAM GIVES PREVIEW OF SKINNIER YOU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mirror , mirror on the wall . . . who ' s the skinniest one of all ? You are , if you are looking_into a mirror that would reflect only a skinny you , no matter how much extra weight you carry . This image -- a &quot; skinny &quot; version of you -- is the focus of a weight loss program at a Mission Hills clinic . While many diet plans are known for their limited menus and exercise regimens , the Lindora Medical Clinic ' s approach puts the emphasis on the psychological side of dieting . It incorporates visual imagery , a tool that founder Dr. Marshall Stamper believes has been instrumental in helping more_than 75 # 000 patients reach their weight loss goals . His 30 clinics throughout California admit up_to 80 patients a day . He attributes a large part of their success to his &quot; skinny mirror , &quot; which he encourages patients to look_into several times a day . Stamper created the mirror by altering the reflective glass so patients actually see a thinner version of themselves when they stand four to five feet away from it . He says the &quot; skinny mirror &quot; is an ideal mental_imagery tool , and an essential part of the Lindora diet program . &quot; By putting the skinny image into your mind , you can begin to accept a new you , &quot; said Stamper , who said the mirror also serves as a motivational tool . &quot; Patients get excited when they actually see how they ' ll look once they ' ve lost the weight. &quot; The program , which costs about $ 75 a week after initiation fees , also follows a &quot; fat-burning &quot; diet , where patients are encouraged to eat foods high in protein , low in carbohydrates . Once patients begin losing_weight , they are taught to focus_on metabolic adjustment , where they increase their calorie intake . Patients are required to visit the clinic five days a week to receive frequent supervision by trained medical doctors and counselors . Granada Hills resident Rosalie Black lost more_than 60 pounds in 10 weeks on the Lindora program . She has 24 pounds to go . &quot; I tried every diet in the world and failed , &quot; said Black , who has gone from a size 22 to a size 16 . Black said using the &quot; skinny mirror &quot; contributes greatly to her daily success on the diet . &quot; Every time I look in that mirror I see a thinner me . Today , I ' m smaller than I ' ve ever been. &quot; Jan Hunter , director of Lindora ' s nursing services and clinic operations , believes the program is successful because it first deals with the mental_picture patients have of themselves . &quot; When we put someone in front of the skinny mirror , we are giving their brain a picture of what they can be , &quot; said Hunter . &quot; In their subconscious they are thin . This is what helps them reach their goal. &quot; ALICIA DOYLEWEIGHT REDUCTION PROGRAMS</TEXT>
