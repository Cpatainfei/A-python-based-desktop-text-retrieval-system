   <TEXT> A modified toilet plunger developed at the University of California may work significantly better than conventional CPR to resuscitate heart_attack victims , according to results of a trial reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . The device was developed by UC physicians who treated a man whose son had used a toilet plunger to resuscitate him . It is essentially a suction cup that expands the lungs when it is pulled_away from the chest . Patients treated with the device were more likely to survive than those who were treated with conventional cardiopulmonary_resuscitation in the 130-patient trial . But the results were not statistically significant because the study -- and four others like it -- was terminated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because informed consent was not obtained from participants . Proponents are calling_for a larger study of the device , called the Ambu CardioPump , which is approved for use throughout much of the world , including Canada , England and most of Europe . The new technique is called active compression-decompression CPR . In conventional CPR , intermittent pressure is applied to the chest to stimulate the heart and air is forced into the lungs through the mouth . In the new method , the suction device is pressed to the sternum and withdrawn repeatedly . This action not only stimulates the heart , but inflates and deflates the lungs as well . The trial was conducted in St . Paul , Minn. , said Dr. Keith G . Lurie of the University of Minnesota . Lurie co-invented the CardioPump while he was a faculty_member at UC San Francisco . Over a 10-month period , 77 patients received standard CPR and 53 received the new method . The team reported that 26 % of the patients who received standard CPR were revived and admitted to intensive care units , while 40 % of those who received the new treatment were admitted . The remainder of the heart_attack victims died . But because the study was ended early , the team did not study a large enough number of patients for the results to be ascribed to use of the new method rather than chance , Lurie said . Better results were achieved when the group considered only patients who were treated within 10 minutes of their heart_attack . Among this group , 38 % of those treated by the new method were eventually released from the hospital , compared to 20 % of those treated with standard CPR . &quot; These results are statistically significant &quot; because the differences in results between the two groups is larger , even though a smaller number of people were involved , Lurie said . The study was ended last year by the FDA , which has sharply limited most clinical trials of resuscitation techniques , Dr. Carin M . Olson , a contributing editor of JAMA , wrote in an accompanying editorial . The problem is the difficulty in obtaining informed consent from patients or their families for participation in a clinical trial . In these cases , the patients are too sick to give permission , and family members are either not present or too distraught to give consent in the short time available before treatment must be begun . The researchers obtained permission from relatives after the fact , a concept called deferred consent . But the FDA recently decided that it would no longer accept trials involving deferred consent , Olson said . Considering the potential benefits of the Ambu CardioPump and other potential resuscitation devices and techniques , Olson said , the FDA rules are absurd .</TEXT>
