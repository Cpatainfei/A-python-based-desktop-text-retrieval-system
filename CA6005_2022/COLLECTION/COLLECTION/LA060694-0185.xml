   <HEADLINE> SEVERAL KEY RULINGS WILL FILL HIGH_COURT ' S FINAL DAYS ; LAW : JUSTICES HAVE LEFT SOME OF THE TOUGHEST CASES FOR LAST . DECISIONS ON ABORTION PROTESTS , THE DEATH_PENALTY , TAXES AND VOTING_RIGHTS REMAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a Thursday afternoon in late May , the justices of the Supreme Court gathered_in an ornate conference_room for a music recital . Justice Harry A . Blackmun , who had conceived the idea and invited six distinguished musicians , said he thought listening to music together would have a salutary impact on his often-combative colleagues . The recital and the reception that followed would &quot; increase the level of joviality among the justices at this time_of_year , &quot; Blackmun commented in introducing the program . For the high_court , &quot; this time of the year &quot; is decision time . In the last week of May and first weeks of June , the justices must finally decide their cases , some of which have been pending since the first week in October . Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist , a stickler for working by the clock , insists that all_the opinions be ready for announcement by the last week in June . While the court has heard fewer cases during this term , it now finds itself in the usual spot -- with some of the hardest cases left for last . Here are highlights among the 35 cases still awaiting decision : CABLE TV -- Does the 1992 law that requires local cable_television operators to broadcast virtually all nearby over-the-air stations violate the 1st Amendment rights of the cable companies ? If the justices agree with the industry , the ruling in the case of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. vs . the Federal Communications Commission could have broad impact in the communications field . ABORTION PICKETING -- Can a judge block anti-abortion protesters from picketing and praying at the gates of an abortion clinic , or does such an order violate their free-speech rights ? A ruling in the case of Madsen vs . Women ' s Health Center could affect the constitutionality of the newly enacted federal law designed to protect abortion facilities . DEATH_PENALTY -- Is California ' s death_penalty law unconstitutional because it permits jurors to consider vague factors when deciding upon a sentence of life in prison or death for a convicted killer ? A ruling in Tuilaepa vs . California could affect the fate of the state ' s 375 inmates on Death Row , but the justices indicated during the March arguments in the case that they are likely to uphold the law . RELIGION -- Can a state carve out a special school district to serve a separatist religious sect ? If the answer is yes in this New York case , other sects are likely to seek the same benefits . But the ruling in the Village of Kiryas Joel vs . Grumet is likely to be narrowly focused and will not have a broad impact on other cases involving the separation of church and state . UNITARY TAXES -- Is California ' s now-repealed unitary tax on multinational corporations unconstitutional ? A loss in the case of Barclay ' s Bank vs . Franchise_Tax Board could cost the state as much as $ 4 billion , but during oral arguments , the justices sounded as though they will reject the bank ' s claim . VOTING_RIGHTS -- Is a state required to maximize the number of legislative seats for blacks and Latinos when drawing boundaries for voting districts ? This case from Florida raises a series of complicated questions because benefiting blacks can hurt Latinos and vice versa . The justices heard arguments in Johnson vs . DeGrandy on the first Monday in October but have struggled since then to issue a decision . SIGNS -- Can a city outlaw the display of all signs and billboards , except those necessary to identify a residence or business ? If the court were to rule for the city in Ladue , Mo. , vs . Gilleo , officials would have far broader authority to ban billboards and other &quot; visual clutter. &quot; RETROACTIVE TAXES -- Can Congress repeal a tax_benefit after a taxpayer has taken_advantage of it and order the Internal Revenue Service to seek retroactive payments ? Since the 1930s , the high_court has given state and federal_officials broad powers to impose retroactive taxes , but the case of U.S. vs . Carlton has forced the justices to rethink that doctrine . PROPERTY_RIGHTS -- Can city officials force a store owner to give_up some of his property for use as a bike path as a condition of getting a building_permit , or is that requirement an unconstitutional &quot; taking &quot; of private_property ? In a 1987 case involving a Ventura beachfront home , the high_court said it would frown_on a public agency ' s demands that amounted to &quot; extortion &quot; of property_owners , but the justices have been unable to agree on a clear standard .</TEXT>
