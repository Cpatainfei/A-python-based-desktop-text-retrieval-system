   <TEXT> At the height of the Cold_War , someone surely would have paid a mighty sum for a full-color , aerial photograph of America ' s front_line against communism at Bitburg Air_Base . Today , Mayor Horst Buettner gives the pictures away in a hard-driven bid to sell the entire 1 # 200-acre , 480-building compound . But so far his only customers for the former jet fighter and missile base are tire kickers . &quot; We get one or two inquiries a week , &quot; Buettner says between cigarettes . &quot; But I doubt we ' ll find someone to buy_it all. &quot; What ' s the price ? &quot; Oh , &quot; he says , brightening . &quot; You can have all_of it for about $ 50 million. &quot; The Amis are going_home , shipping out of this area of western Germany once known as &quot; NATO ' s aircraft_carrier &quot; because of all_of the U.S. air_bases . With American forces drawing down to 100 # 000 troops in Europe from 340 # 000 , nearby Hahn Air_Base was closed a year ago and , just to the south , Zweibruecken was shut_down in 1991 . The U.S. military will hand_over Bitburg ' s keys to the German government on the last_day of September . Neighboring Spangdahlem Air_Base is supposed to remain open , but rumors run_through Bitburg that even Spangdahlem will be closed_in a couple years , and that , says the Social Democratic mayor , would be &quot; a complete disaster. &quot; &quot; Everyone appreciates that the Cold_War is over and that it is good for humanity in_general that the Americans don ' t have to be here anymore , &quot; Buettner says in near-perfect English . &quot; Mostly , everyone just hates to see the Americans go. &quot; Buettner ' s lament is indeed heard throughout the Bitburg area -- where Americans have spent about $ 200 million a year on everything from construction contracts to beer steins -- and in other such U.S. garrison towns that have developed hybrid cultures over the last four decades . Until last year , 12 # 000 Americans lived_in Bitburg side_by_side with a like number of Germans . With 2 # 500 intermarriages since the base opened in 1953 -- more_than one a week on average -- nearly every Bitburg family has an American son-in-law or a German daughter in America . And nearly every homeowner has had a GI living_in guest quarters , paying rent that helped to pay the mortgage . Although most Americans first heard of Bitburg in 1985 , when a visit by then-President Ronald Reagan to a cemetery in which Waffen SS soldiers are buried stirred_up much controversy , the town has long been a favored post for Air_Force troops . Bitburg is the home of Bitburger Pils beer and the Bitburg Warriors baseball_team , whose German and American players won the state championship last year in the sub-AAA league . The German-style Im Kuhstall tavern is not far from the American bar Your Place or Mine . Rosie ' s Garage , another American favorite , has closed with the departure of so many beer_drinkers . &quot; Bye , Boys , &quot; says Stern Magazine ' s melancholy story on the departure of American troops -- and dollars -- from Bitburg . For unlike Panama , for example , where the U.S. presence has been regarded with as much suspicion as appreciation , Germany actually seems to like its American troops . In Bitburg , the U.S. military was largely seen as a protector rather than as an occupying force . Residents say they felt safe with their American allies , even if the base made their town a likely target in a hot_war with the Soviet_Union . The entire country , after all , was a bull ' s-eye in the Cold_War conflict . Bitburg was a small_town of about 5 # 000 people in the 1950s when the Americans moved_in with their broad grins and rock ' n ' roll music . Bitburgers worked in the brewery , in construction or farming , growing hops and raising cattle . Then the Americans brought millions of dollars , thousands of jobs and that big , open , easy way that Americans have . They drove large cars and used electric clothes_dryers . They celebrated the Fourth_of_July and hung their Christmas decorations in exotic ways . In came McDonald ' s right at the entrance to the base , and down the street Dave ' s Tattoo opened for business on those meaty American arms . There were all kinds of Americans , blacks and Latinos , Southerners and Midwesterners . Living all together like that , they just seemed more tolerant , more open-minded than small-town Germans . &quot; When I was growing_up , I used to love going onto the base , &quot; says Noach Rosenzweig , owner of the 1950s-style Max Diner . &quot; I liked the multicultural situation . I liked it because it was like being abroad in the States . Americans take things so_much easier than Germans do. &quot; The 32-year-old Bitburg native wears jeans and sandals and an American take-it-easy attitude . His diner serves BLTs and Sloppy Joes to a background of jukebox music . Like most people in town , Rosenzweig speaks colloquial English . His wife is half-American , the daughter of a German woman and a GI . And although he has been to the United States twice , most of what he knows about Americans he learned in Bitburg . The U.S. base was Bitburg ' s window to the world . During the Cuban missile crisis , the base went_on highest alert , warning residents that war might be near . Bitburg students protested the Vietnam_War and then were introduced to illegal drugs by U.S. soldiers returning from Southeast_Asia . Seventy-two F-15 jet fighters were stationed at the base , along with a Patriot missile battery . Pacifists demonstrated against the installation of a system to direct cruise missiles in the 1980s but failed to prevent it . And there was the incessant , piercing noise of jet_engines , of aircraft taking_off for hot spots around the world and landing again , polluting the Bitburg skies in their practice runs_for a showdown with the Soviets . &quot; Those old Phantom jets were the loudest , &quot; says environmentalist Hermann Schaefer , who lives_in a village behind the base . &quot; And the exercises . They ' d circle over here 30 , 70 , 120 times a day . One day the village of Gondorf counted 268 overflights. &quot; Some Bitburgers clearly felt a love-hate for the Americans , who wanted to be everywhere and police the world , who threw their money around back when the dollar was 4 marks to 1 -- it ' s now hovering above 1.5 marks -- and sometimes acted_as if they thought they were better than anyone else . But as the Americans pack up their belongings and moving vans file through town the way military trucks once did , nostalgia already has set_in for the good old days . Scarcely a harsh word can be heard against the Amis . &quot; The Americans are such fun people , &quot; says Birgit Platz , a saleswoman at the Auto Nova rental car agency . &quot; I had a lot of good American friends here in Bitburg , and I am going_to miss them. &quot; No doubt Bitburg will miss their business too . With the loss of its GI market , Auto Nova has given_up car sales -- once about 50 % of its income -- and is only in the rental business . The company already has eliminated the job of Platz ' s American colleague , Keith Bearden . &quot; Ever since the Gulf War , our business has been falling , &quot; says Bearden , who settled in Bitburg with his German wife four years ago . &quot; During the war everyone was gone . When they came_back we thought we ' d have a booming business again , but no . There was uncertainty . People started saving their money to pay_off bills just in case they were moved . &quot; The closure will make this place a ghost_town . You take_away $ 200 million a year and businesses close_down . It ' s just starting , &quot; he says . Mayor Buettner tries to minimize the impact of the drawdown , noting that nearly 5 # 000 Americans will be based at Spangdahlem , many of them living with their families in Bitburg . He hands_out a brochure that shows Bitburg at the center of a radar screen stretching from Paris to Amsterdam to Munich -- a perfect central location for industry in Europe , he says . But businessman Heinz Bappert is not so upbeat . He sees a town with no great highway connections and no adjoining cities to provide ready markets . Bappert has made a good living in Bitburg , but 90 % of his electrical business came from U.S. contracts that run_out next year when he finishes renovations on apartment_houses for Spangdahlem troops . Then , he says , he doesn ' t know what he will do with his 35 employees , part of the more_than 2 # 000 Bitburgers whose livelihoods depend_on American money . Bappert is looking_for new contracts_in the surrounding area but figures that his son eventually will have to move the family_business elsewhere . &quot; After the Americans pull_out , it ' s going_to be dead here , &quot; Bappert says . For some it already is . Harry Delges left his job at Merchants National_Bank in Bitburg because even though the branch will remain open , &quot; there ' s no more chance to make a career there. &quot; Instead , he commutes an hour each day to a bank in Luxembourg and an hour back home at night . &quot; If people want to find work , they ' re going to have to get used to this , &quot; Delges says . Some residents blame the Bitburger brewery for the town ' s predicament , saying the beer-maker fought for years to keep_out industries that might have competed for workers and driven_up wages . Other residents blame environmentalists like Schaefer , whose Defend Yourself group helped keep the Americans from building a second runway on the base in the late 1980s and from cutting_down several acres of woods to do so . &quot; They wanted to put_in a second runway 43 meters from the fence , &quot; Schaefer recalls . &quot; We knew they ' d come_back after they had it built and say that 43 meters was too close to the fence and ask_for even more land. &quot; Schaefer says the Americans &quot; dealt with the environment here like they had another one to replace it. &quot; They spilled jet fuel , their pipelines leaked , they used defoliants and buried chemicals and ammunitions , he says . He believes that studies now under way will prove the area to be an environmental mess , a charge that the Americans deny . As for those who think that the U.S._government might have spared Bitburg if it just had two runways , Schaefer only laughs . &quot; My opinion is that the Americans would have gone anyway , leaving us with a second runway and the woods chopped_down . They don ' t have the money anymore to support such a military presence in Europe , &quot; he says . U.S. Air_Force Master Sgt . Bob Tobias doesn ' t disagree . One runway or two , with such a large-scale drawdown , something had to give . Tobias , a public relations officer , drives through the near-deserted base in an orange Opel with &quot; For Sale &quot; signs_in the windows , past empty office_buildings and hollow aircraft hangars . The runway is_quiet , and Tobias is visibly saddened by the overgrown fields that used to be cropped as close as a soldier ' s hair . &quot; It ' s always depressing to say goodby to your friends , but here it ' s worse because there ' s not a chance you ' ll ever be back . The base won ' t be here , &quot; Tobias says . Like the mayor , he insists that there is life for a town after a base closure and points to Hahn Air_Base , which he helped to shut_down a year ago . Hahn is operating as a private landing_strip for charter companies and a flying school . Germany ' s police_academy also is moving_in there . Tobias knows of a Belgian company that has shown interest in_using a_couple_of the dark hangars at Bitburg to grow mushrooms . A fireworks producer has looked_at them as storage_space , and so has a tire company . But Bitburg is competing with the other former base towns for investment now . Four years after its closure , Zweibruecken still has 30 % unemployment and has replaced only about a quarter of the jobs that the Air_Force once provided . Moreover , said Zweibruecken Mayor Juergen Lambert , life is never quite the same without the Amis . &quot; They belonged_to us , &quot; he asserts . Amen , say Bitburgers . &quot; I grew_up with Americans , &quot; city worker Heiner Giller says . &quot; They were part of this city. &quot;</TEXT>
