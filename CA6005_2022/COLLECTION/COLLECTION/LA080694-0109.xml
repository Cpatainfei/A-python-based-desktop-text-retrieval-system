   <TEXT> Since actress Sharon Tate was slain in her Benedict Canyon home , at least 18 # 335 people have been murdered in the city of Los Angeles . But no killers have become as notorious as the bizarre cult members responsible_for the gruesome slaughter of Aug . 9 , 1969 . While Tate ' s husband , film director Roman Polanski , was in Europe , the pregnant actress and four visitors were beaten , stabbed and shot . The word PIGS was scrawled on the front_door in Tate ' s blood . A wave of fear swept the city , heightened by the discovery the next day of store owners Leno and Rosemary LaBianca , who had been tortured and killed in a similar fashion in their Los Feliz home . Only months later did the public hear of Charles Manson , a wild-eyed career criminal and his &quot; family , &quot; runaways from middle-class life who lived with him on a remote San Fernando Valley ranch . Even a quarter of a century later , the names are chillingly familiar : Susan Atkins . Patricia Krenwinkel . Leslie Van Houten . Tex Watson . All are serving life terms in prison for the Tate-LaBianca murders along with their long-haired guru -- a wanna-be songwriter who hung_around the fringes of the Los Angeles music scene . Even now as he sits isolated in one of California ' s toughest prisons , Manson has gained a new mystique as a kind of criminal antihero . People play his songs , peddle his writings and sell his likeness on T-shirts and dresses for girls . Near the prison , at least one follower has taken_up residence , waiting to see Charlie again . For the relatives of Manson ' s victims , the past has proved difficult to forget . Some have devoted their lives to keeping Manson behind bars . Another has found God and forgiven her mother ' s killer . One even has won reparations from Manson . Bartek Frykowski was 9 years old and living_in Poland when his father , Voytek Frykowski , a friend of Polanski ' s , was stabbed 51 times and shot at the Benedict Canyon estate . &quot; Manson destroyed my life really , &quot; Frykowski said from the German village where he lives . &quot; Always this case was with me . I became a different man without a father. &quot; Finally seeing results from a lawsuit filed more_than two decades ago , Frykowski has received $ 75 # 000 in royalties for a song Manson wrote before the murders . &quot; Look_at Your Game Girl &quot; was used by Manson to lure young hippie women into his fold . Last year , Guns N ' Roses recorded it on an album that has sold more_than 2 million copies worldwide -- with Manson ' s share of the profits going_to Frykowski . Frykowski said he is using the money to help give his two children the sense of security he never had , and he is writing a book about his father and Manson . He wonders how Manson ' s music could become popular -- and how a mass murderer could become a cult celebrity among young people in Europe and the United States . &quot; People have a fascination with evil , &quot; Frykowski said . &quot; But why do they think Charles Manson is their hero ? &quot; A Bloody Rampage and a Lone Survivor William Garretson has spent most of the last 25 years trying to forget how close he came_to becoming one of Manson ' s victims . Garretson , then 19 and fresh from Ohio , served as caretaker and lived_in a guest house on the Cielo Drive estate rented by Tate and Polanski . On the night of Aug . 8 , Garretson received an unexpected visit from Steven Parent , a hi-fi enthusiast he had met hitchhiking . After Parent left , Garretson stayed_up until dawn , writing letters and listening to his stereo . In the morning , the caretaker was awakened by three police_officers pointing their guns and shouting at him to freeze . By his account , they knocked him to the ground , roughed him up and put him in handcuffs . Then they led him past a scene so grotesque it is etched in his memory : The bodies of Frykowski and his girlfriend Abigail Folger -- heiress to a coffee fortune -- were lying on the lawn covered in blood , each stabbed dozens of times . In the driveway , Parent was slumped in his car , shot four times . The police spared Garretson a sight just as horrible inside the house . Tate , 8 1 / 2 months pregnant , had been stabbed repeatedly and was curled in a fetal position as if to protect her unborn son . Nearby , a bloody towel covered the head of hairdresser Jay Sebring , her former boyfriend , who had been stabbed and shot . The two were connected by a rope hung over a rafter and looped around their necks . The police did not believe Garretson ' s claim that he had heard nothing during the night and they quickly arrested him . &quot; It was very gruesome , &quot; Garretson recalled in a recent interview , &quot; and finding one person alive on the estate was surprising to the police. &quot; Garretson was still in custody that night when the LaBiancas were tied_up with lamp cords and stabbed to death in Los Feliz . &quot; DEATH TO PIGS &quot; and the misspelled &quot; HEALTER SKELTER &quot; were written in their blood on a wall and the refrigerator . A carving fork was protruding from Leno LaBianca ' s stomach , and the word &quot; WAR &quot; was cut_in his flesh . Garretson was freed the next day after he passed a polygraph test . But because police did not initially believe that the Tate and LaBianca cases were connected , he remained a suspect for months . The sensational killings stunned and terrified Los Angeles . With the killer or killers on_the_loose , suspicion and paranoia ran wild . Frank Sinatra was reported to be in hiding . Mia Farrow did not attend Tate ' s funeral out of fear she might be next . Sebring ' s friend , Steve McQueen , began carrying a gun in his car . Gun sales soared in Beverly Hills and the price of guard_dogs jumped sevenfold . Off-duty police were hired to patrol private estates and security firms tripled in size . &quot; When you talk_about the Manson case , you ' re talking_about perhaps the most bizarre murder case in the annals of crime , &quot; said Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi . &quot; There was a lot of fear . People were canceling parties , canceling people from guest lists . The words printed in blood made_it especially frightening for the Hollywood crowd. &quot; After nearly four months of investigation , police linked the Tate and LaBianca slayings to Manson , who lived with his followers on the Spahn Movie Ranch above Chatsworth . During the trial , Bugliosi proved that Manson ordered three followers to commit the Benedict Canyon killings : Charles ( Tex ) Watson , a former high_school athletic star ; Krenwinkel , a onetime Sunday_school teacher , and Atkins , a former topless dancer who once sang in her church choir . Atkins , the jury learned , stabbed Tate as she pleaded with her killers to spare her unborn son . The jury also found that Watson , Krenwinkel and Van Houten , a former homecoming princess from Monrovia , stabbed the LaBiancas . But this time , the evidence showed , Manson entered the house first , tied_up the couple and left before the killing started . Linda Kasabian , a Manson family newcomer who was along both nights because she was the only one with a valid driver ' s license , turned state ' s evidence and testified against the others . At the trial , Bugliosi argued that the motive for the murders was a bizarre plan to trigger a race war known as Helter Skelter , a name taken from a Beatles song . Manson said that blacks were inferior to whites but would win the war . Then , unable to rule , they would hand_over power to Manson and his all-white family , which planned to survive by living underground near Death_Valley . The 9 1 / 2-month trial of Manson , Atkins , Krenwinkel and Van Houten -- a record length for its time -- was punctuated by memorable moments : Manson and his &quot; girls &quot; cutting Xs in their foreheads ; Manson lunging at Judge Charles H . Older with a pencil ; President Richard Nixon proclaiming Manson guilty in mid-trial headlines ; Manson and his followers shaving their heads , and the disappearance of Van Houten ' s attorney , Ronald Hughes . He was later found dead and prosecutors believe he was another Manson victim . Manson , Atkins and Krenwinkel were found guilty on seven counts of murder . Van Houten was convicted of two murders . Watson was tried separately and convicted of seven murders . In a later trial , Manson was convicted in the murder of two other family victims , music_teacher Gary Hinman and ranch_hand Donald ( Shorty ) Shea . Manson and his four followers were sentenced to death , but in 1972 the state Supreme Court overturned capital_punishment and their sentences were reduced to life in prison . Although up for parole many times , all five remain behind bars . Kasabian moved to the East Coast . After the trial , Garretson sued the Los Angeles Police_Department for false arrest , seeking $ 1 million . In 1974 , a jury decided that the police had acted properly , in part because he was the only survivor found on the estate . But the jurors also were sympathetic . &quot; We felt Garretson was the sixth victim &quot; of the Benedict Canyon murders , foreman John Rutherford said afterward . Garretson returned to Ohio soon after his release from jail . Today , he drives a truck for a grocery_store chain and his brief time in Los Angeles is a distant blur . &quot; I try not to even think_about it , &quot; he said . &quot; It was a terrifying experience in my life and it was a tragedy . It ' s something I would like to leave in the past. &quot; Manson Speaks About Life Behind Bars California ' s most notorious criminal spends his time at the state_prison in Corcoran , doing menial chores , playing his guitar and planting a flower_garden . Charles Manson will turn 60 in November . He still claims he is innocent_of the Tate-LaBianca murders and contends he was denied a fair trial . But after spending three-quarters of his life locked_up , he says he has no desire to leave prison . &quot; What would I want out for ? &quot; he asked_in a telephone_interview . &quot; This beats an old folks home. &quot; He long ago turned the X on his forehead into a swastika , but he says he was never the villain the media have made him out_to be . &quot; I am a man of God , &quot; he said . &quot; I am not a bad_person , I am a good person. &quot; The son of a 16-year-old prostitute who was imprisoned for armed robbery , Manson was born in Cincinnati and spent his childhood being shuttled among relatives , boys ' homes and juvenile halls . Growing to a height of 5-foot-2 , he became a con_man , a pimp , a forger and a thief . He was convicted of armed robbery when he was 13 , homosexual rape when he was 17 and beating his first wife when he was 20 . By the time he was 32 , he had spent 17 years locked_up . On the day in March , 1967 , when he was paroled from Terminal Island , he pleaded with prison authorities to let him stay in the only home he knew , according to &quot; Helter Skelter , &quot; the best-selling book written by prosecutor Bugliosi and co-author Curt Gentry . Manson was released anyway and arrived in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco , where the hippies were in full bloom . He had learned the guitar in prison and began playing his songs to attract women . Then , like the pimp he once was , he used his women to recruit men . His family quickly multiplied , living for a while with Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson in his Sunset Boulevard mansion , and later splitting time between the Death_Valley area and the Spahn ranch . Manson and his followers took LSD and other psychedelic_drugs , lived_off discarded food and petty crime and indulged in orgies that were orchestrated by Manson to break_down sexual taboos . His followers believed he was Christ . Held in various state_prisons since 1971 , his life behind bars has been eventful . He was set_on_fire by inmates at the California Medical Facility at Vacaville , and was attacked by prisoners at San Quentin and Folsom prisons . He has broken prison rules 60 times : spitting in a guard ' s face , throwing hot coffee at a staff_member , possessing a hacksaw blade , refusing to obey orders , fighting and trying to flood a tier . As a result , he spent more_than five years in near solitary confinement at Corcoran , body-searched and manacled each time he moved from the cell . In May , the restrictions were eased and he was moved_into the high-security Protective Housing Unit . He now has a cellmate and access to a telephone and dines with such infamous killers as mass murderer Juan Corona and Sirhan Sirhan , Robert F . Kennedy ' s assassin . Of Sirhan , Manson said : &quot; He ' s cool. &quot; Today , Charlie Manson -- still longhaired but with gray in his beard -- has become something of a cult hero among some young people too young to remember the murders . In addition to the Guns N ' Roses album , Manson ' s recordings are available in_stores . So is a song by Manson that the Beach Boys recorded in 1968 without giving him credit . His face is seen on clothing and trading_cards . And there is an underground market in Manson memorabilia . Richard and Dan Lemmons , who make a controversial line of Manson T-shirts under the name Zooport Riot Gear in Newport Beach , say they have sold 25 # 000 shirts and caps bearing his likeness . &quot; His face represents the counterculture rebellion against society , &quot; said Richard Lemmons , 36 . The brothers promised Manson they would pay him 10 cents for each item sold . But after learning of Bartek Frykowski ' s claim on the prisoner ' s earnings , they said they put his share_in escrow and do not feel he is owed anything . Prison officials say they have no way of knowing if Manson has received income from royalties or interview fees -- or even whether he maintains bank_accounts . Manson insists he has not made a penny from the merchandising of his name . &quot; What do I need money in prison for ? &quot; he said . &quot; They give me clothes , they feed me . I don ' t need to pay rent . I don ' t need money for lawyers. &quot; Some of Manson ' s supporters have begun making the case that the cult leader should be freed from prison . They say he was wrongly convicted of murder because he was not present when the killings occurred . Some , like Manson , say he was not allowed to present a defense in court . Others go so far as_to say , erroneously , that he was convicted only of conspiracy . A few suggest -- without the benefit of any proof -- that there was a conspiracy to cover_up the murders by powerful people in the entertainment_industry . &quot; It was a different time back then , &quot; Richard Lemmons said . &quot; You could get convicted on a lot less evidence than today. &quot; Contending that the Helter Skelter motive is too absurd to be believed , supporters offer different motives that focus the blame primarily on Watson . Some say the killings were the result of a drug deal gone_bad . Others contend that they were copycat murders intended to free Bobby Beausoleil , a family member in jail for the stabbing a_few days earlier of music_teacher Hinman . Hinman ' s killers had written &quot; POLITICAL PIGGY &quot; on the wall_in his blood . &quot; Tex Watson is the one who killed everybody and is responsible_for the whole_thing , &quot; said John Aes-Nihil of Canoga Park , who sells a range of Manson memorabilia , including Jay Sebring shampoo boxes . &quot; There is some possibility ( Manson ) is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder , but I don ' t think he did anything illegal. &quot; The effort to rewrite history and glorify Manson disturbs Bugliosi , who made his reputation by putting Manson behind bars . &quot; They think he ' s a cool guy , &quot; Bugliosi said . &quot; They don ' t know who he is . For someone to be sentenced to death , and then all these years later to have Manson T-shirts and songs on pop albums is really a sad commentary. &quot; Bugliosi vigorously disputes Manson ' s contention that he did not receive a fair trial and was not allowed to present a defense . During the prosecution ' s case , Manson ' s attorney conducted extensive cross-examination of the witnesses , Bugliosi noted . After the prosecution ended , Manson and his co-defendants rested their case without calling any witnesses . Afterward , Atkins , Krenwinkel and Van Houten said they wanted to testify and take the blame for the killings . But their attorneys objected and the judge refused to overrule the lawyers . &quot; The claim that Manson was not allowed to present a defense is so silly and ludicrous , &quot; Bugliosi said . And the fact that Manson did not inflict a fatal wound on any of the victims , Bugliosi said , does not make him any less a murderer under the law . &quot; If you order a murder , you can ' t insulate yourself from criminal responsibility , &quot; he said . &quot; Manson was the architect , the mastermind of the murders. &quot; Defense_attorney Paul Fitzgerald , who represented Krenwinkel , is among those who agree that there is no question Manson was properly convicted . &quot; The people who are saying he is not_guilty are muddled thinkers who have not examined the record and are saying it for the wrong reasons , &quot; he said . &quot; This adulation of him as a mass killer , a convicted killer of innocent people , is kind of ghastly -- a leader with a swastika carved in his head is beyond sicko . It makes my skin crawl . He ' s not an antihero , he ' s a creep. &quot; Recently , Krenwinkel , Van Houten and Atkins broke their silence and condemned Manson , urging young people not to think_of him as a hero . &quot; I can assure you . . . from firsthand experience that his depravity and depth of cruelty make him a truly base human_being , deserving no one ' s attention , let alone admiration , &quot; Atkins wrote in a letter to The Times and other newspapers earlier this year . Manson still delivers the same message of social calamity in his rambling , disjointed style . The environment is being destroyed , he says ; its children are being abused and ignored . The planet is in chaos and helter skelter -- a state of confusion -- is at_hand . &quot; It would take a madman to adjust to this world , &quot; he said . The entertainment_industry has turned good and evil upside down , helping to make heroes of violent criminals , he said . &quot; What is a bad_guy these days ? It seems to be the good_guy , &quot; he said . &quot; Arnold Schwarzenegger -- it ' s OK for him to escape_from prison and kill eight or nine people . Where are your standards ? &quot; While denying that he ordered the Tate-LaBianca murders or was involved in the killing , Manson suggested that the slayings were part of an effort to bring_about social change . He also says there is no reason he should feel remorse . &quot; Everybody in the world wants to get mad at me because I won ' t show remorse because somebody died , &quot; he said . &quot; Somebody dies every day. &quot; For Bugliosi , the trial was the case of a career . He ran_for Los Angeles County district_attorney and lost , then spent two years working_on &quot; Helter Skelter. &quot; He has taken occasional legal cases and written other true-crime books . &quot; The one negative association about the case , &quot; he said , &quot; is no matter what I do , I ' ll be forever known as the Manson prosecutor. &quot; But he understands the fascination with Manson . More_than any other crime , he says , the gruesome murders and Manson ' s power over his followers have both repelled and captivated the public . &quot; The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil , &quot; Bugliosi said . &quot; Over the past 25 years , he has come_to represent the dark and malignant side of humanity , and for whatever reason , there is a side of human nature that is fascinated with ultimate evil. &quot; Victims ' Survivors Continue the Vigil On the day after the Tate killings , Susan Struthers was among those who found the bodies of her mother , Rosemary LaBianca , and stepfather , Leno . In the weeks following , she suffered a nervous_breakdown . Later , she began to find peace as a born-again_Christian . In the mid-1980s , she started writing anonymous letters to Tex Watson , the most brutal of the Manson family killers . In prison , he had also become a born-again_Christian , gotten_married and fathered three children during conjugal visits . After corresponding with Watson for a year , Struthers decided she wanted to meet him . &quot; My motive was to bring understanding to the tragedy of losing my parents , &quot; she later explained . She visited him at the California Men ' s Colony in San Luis Obispo and soon was convinced of his remorse and sincerity . And so she told Watson she was the daughter of the LaBiancas , forgave him and began spending time with his family and friends . Known by her married name of Susan LaBerge , she appeared in 1990 at Watson ' s parole hearing and argued that he was a model prisoner who had paid his debt to society . &quot; During our visit , I shared the forgiveness I felt toward him and I felt very certain that Charles was deeply remorseful for what he had done , &quot; she told the parole board . By a strange coincidence , LaBerge was living_in the same coastal California town as Patti Tate , Sharon ' s younger sister , when they happened to meet in the late 1980s . The women discovered their common past , but quickly realized that their differing beliefs would keep them from ever becoming friends . &quot; Needless to say , it created a hostile situation between us , &quot; Tate said . &quot; To even think Watson deserves to get_out of prison , I don ' t know where she ' s coming from. &quot; Following in the footsteps of her mother , Doris Tate , Patti has become an outspoken opponent of parole for Manson family members and an advocate of tougher laws against crime . Now 36 , she too has appeared at parole hearings , but her goal has been to confront , not forgive , her sister ' s killers . At a hearing last year for Susan Atkins , Patti Tate recalled , &quot; I stood_up and said : ' My sister would have loved to have her baby . I would love to have my nephew here . But you took that away. ' &quot; After the murders , Doris Tate became a strong anti-crime advocate and helped collect more_than 350 # 000 signatures on petitions opposing parole for the Manson followers . Shortly before her death in 1992 , she founded the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau , a Sacramento group that lobbies for tougher sanctions against criminals . Patti Tate serves on the board . &quot; I feel it ' s very unfortunate that we even have to worry about these people ever getting_out , &quot; she said . &quot; When someone has a life sentence , it should be that exactly. &quot; At least eight of the original family members are serving life terms . Others have done time for assorted crimes and are scattered across California , Nevada and the Midwest . In the San Joaquin Valley farm towns around the Corcoran prison , rumors abound of Manson followers who remain in the area . But the only original family member with a visible presence is Sandra Good , who took an apartment in Hanford to be near Manson . One of Manson ' s most loyal supporters , she was in jail on other charges during the 1969 murder rampage , but joined the family ' s Downtown street_corner vigils during the trial . When Manson carved an X on his forehead , she did the same . When Manson shaved his head , she shaved hers . In 1971 , Good was convicted of helping family member Kenneth Como escape_from prison . She served six months . In 1975 , she mailed threatening letters to corporate_executives and government officials . She was sentenced to 15 years in prison and served 10 . When her parole in Vermont ended in 1991 , she moved_back to California . Prison officials have refused to let her see Manson and she has petitioned the court for visiting privileges . In an interview , Good said she was never among those who believed Manson was Christ . &quot; To me , he is far beyond Jesus_Christ , far bigger , &quot; she said . She explained her devotion to Manson , saying : &quot; He has real authority . I ' m talking_about the kind of authority that comes from God . Manson has always spoken the truth and that is a big part of the reason he is locked up. &quot; She rejects the idea that the Tate-LaBianca murders were committed to bring_on the disintegration of society . But , she said : &quot; You see where L.A. is at . You see the real helter skelter unfolding before your eyes. &quot; And unlike the three women who took_part in the Tate-LaBianca killings , Good still says the murders were justified as a necessary prelude to social change . &quot; We were the kids that cared and wanted to change the world and , yes , those murders were very justified , &quot; Good said . &quot; In spirit , I ' m still at war . that ' s just as powerful as if I went and put a knife in some person ' s stomach in Hollywood. &quot; THE MANSON MURDERS : 25 YEARS LATER On Aug . 9 , 1969 , neighbors called Los Angeles police to a murder scene in the Hollywood Hills that would absorb the nation ' s attention and add a new name to those of the notorious : Charles Manson .
