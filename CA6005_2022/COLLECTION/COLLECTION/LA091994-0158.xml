   <TEXT> Though Gene Birkeland is 72 years old , there are times when she feels_out of place at the senior_citizens apartment complex where she lives . But thanks to her recently acquired computer skills , Birkeland feels right at_home in the work_force . &quot; When I stride through the apartment lobby on my way to work , I pass_by people who are barely creeping . I ' m fortunate to still be able to learn and participate , &quot; said Birkeland , who took a job at age 43 to support two children on_her_own . She developed a career in sales and eventually oversaw a chain of health_food stores . &quot; But the job required me to travel around to all_the stores and by age 60 , driving the freeways was killing me . So I decided it was time to look_for something in an office environment. &quot; But Birkeland found that working in an office required computer skills . &quot; And at first I wanted nothing to do with them , &quot; she said . &quot; But everything I applied for absolutely required it. &quot; Birkeland learned to do cost estimating using a computer spreadsheet program . Then she tackled word-processing programs and decided she liked the work . &quot; I signed_up with the Vicki Heston Personnel Agency in Irvine . They began sending me out on assignments , and I have managed to remain employed with my new skills , &quot; said Birkeland , who types documents for insurance_companies , banks and law_firms . &quot; I like working as a temporary because I can move_in and out of various office environments . I ' m not stuck_in one place , &quot; said Birkeland . She admits that constant typing gets repetitive , but she copes_with that by devising ways to build her typing speed . &quot; It ' s a game for me sometimes to see if I can finish more today than the previous day , &quot; said Birkeland , who is currently attending computer classes four nights a week . &quot; I ' m a firm believer in adult_education . I have taken classes at Orange Coast College , Coastline Community_College and UC Irvine since 1967 . You can ' t sit still . You have to keep_going , &quot; she said . Birkeland hopes to launch a home-based business with her word_processing skills and eventually branch_out into graphic design projects , such_as sales brochures and flyers . &quot; I am so grateful for these night classes . If they hadn ' t been available to me , I would never have become computer literate . I am looking_forward to the day I can get_to e-mail as well as the Internet. &quot; OCCUPATION : Word_processor * What ' s involved : Typing documents such_as letters , reports and legal_briefs on computers using a variety of word_processing software programs . * Qualifications : Most have at least a high_school education .

Others form their own home-based businesses . * Quote : &quot; I don ' t know why computers intimidated me so_much at first .
