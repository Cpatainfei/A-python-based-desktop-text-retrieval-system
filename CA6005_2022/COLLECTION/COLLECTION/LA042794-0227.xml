   <HEADLINE> RELATIONSHIPS : BREAKING VOWS , BREAKING HABITS ; WHEN A MARRIAGE ENDS , A PARTNER MAY HANG_ON OUT OF OBLIGATION , FEAR , PASSION OR FRIENDSHIP . BUT GETTING OVER DIVORCE IS ESSENTIAL TO MOVING_ON , SAY LOCAL THERAPISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Boomerang love kept couples such_as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and , more recently , Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly from making permanent breaks after their divorce . When a husband and wife begin to dissolve their marriage , going their separate ways can sometimes be so agonizing that one or both may cling_to the other physically or emotionally . &quot; Divorce is so painful , some people would prefer ( to stay in ) an unhealthy relationship &quot; than to separate , explains Phil Hall , founder and director of the Centers for Psychological Growth and Development in Tustin , Anaheim Hills and Cypress . Though there is often plenty of pain in an unhealthy relationship , Hall says the difference in the severity of the pain between staying in a bad marriage and ending it , for some , is comparable_to the difference in pain between a sore and a severed artery . &quot; The sore doesn ' t heal , but a severed artery is life-threatening ; that ' s what divorce feels_like for many people , &quot; he says . Indeed , divorce is &quot; the death of a relationship , and there is a mourning and a grieving time . As long as you hang_on , you are not_able to move through that process , &quot; says Linda Benson , a marriage , family and child counselor who practices in Huntington Beach . Hanging on to each other may stem from habit , passion , obligation or fear . For some , as in the case with Jennifer ( who asked , as did others in this story , that her real name not be used ) , companionship as comfortable as a worn slipper is the reason she can ' t break_with her ex-husband . The Corona del Mar resident says her relationship with her ex-husband , Darren , would probably mystify outsiders , but a deep bond holds them together . Though Jennifer has since become involved with someone else in the two years following their separation and filing for divorce , she continues to socialize with Darren . Mutual interests is her reason for keeping a less intimate form of their relationship alive . &quot; We see foreign films , concerts , things like that ( that ) my new ( man ) isn ' t as into , &quot; Jennifer says . Recent developments -- Darren ' s beingdiagnosed with terminal cancer -- have shifted the relationship even more . Jennifer , who quit her job in September , has been at his bedside during her ex ' s ordeal , because Darren ' s family is in Europe . She was at his side for his chemotherapy treatments and plans to accompany him to Europe so he can say goodby to his family . She even purchased his airplane_ticket with one of the couple ' s mutual credit_cards . &quot; I ' ve always loved him ; he ' s a very dear man , &quot; says Jennifer , who says the reason the marriage didn ' t survive is because he is 28 years older than she is . Sometimes obligation and guilt serve as motivators for continued involvement in a former spouse ' s life . Steven , who has been remarried for 11 years and lives in Tustin , called ex-wife Gloria after the January earthquake and offered to do extensive work_on her San Fernando Valley house . &quot; Often what happens is that the ex or separated husband will continue to act_as the role of handyman , doing the jobs out of obligation . He may care about her welfare and in a limited way retain a small , familial part of the relationship , but he is no longer physically attracted to her because he is having his sexual needs met elsewhere , &quot; Benson says . The most common tie that binds many divorced couples is children . If a couple have children , &quot; there will always be a connection between the two parents , especially if they have spent a third of their life or so with one another , &quot; says Linda Algazi , who has a psychology practice that includes marriage and family therapy in Corona del Mar . Friends and family might assume that couples having trouble letting_go may be candidates for reconciliation . Not necessarily . Lisa , a Newport Beach resident divorced since August , spent 25 years married to Bob . The two &quot; tight friends &quot; continue to run their family_business together . &quot; The love doesn ' t just go_away , but since we still have the same problems , we both know that we just can ' t live together , &quot; Lisa says . &quot; If the couple have identified problems and put forth the time and the effort to change their behavior , they have a chance of making_it work , &quot; says Norman Wright , director of the Family Counseling &amp; Enrichment Center in Tustin . Otherwise , it ' s important that people move_on when the relationship is too impaired to be saved . &quot; If the horse is dead , then it ' s time to stop beating it , &quot; says Bill Flanagan , a marriage , family and child counselor and single adult minister at St . Andrews Presbyterian_Church in Newport Beach . Flanagan , whose biannual workshops have led 10 # 000 adults through divorce recovery since 1971 , says healing is essential before people can move_on to leading a full life . Beginning to let_go means : * Understanding the reality of the situation . &quot; It ' s natural to deny or escape , but a person must wake_up in the morning and assess his or her situation -- they are divorced or lonely or whatever -- instead of operating with a ' this is OK ' superficiality , &quot; Flanagan says . * Dealing with the known and still-to-be-discovered effects of the divorce . &quot; Someone needs to stand_back in a position of emotional neutrality , to give perspective to people who are in the middle of the process , &quot; Flanagan says . * Overcoming obstacles to readjustment that crop_up after the divorce . Sometimes a loss of order in a person ' s life becomes so unbearable he or she may seek_out an ex-spouse for the sole purpose of trying to restore order , says Jim Head of the Mariposa Women ' s Center in Orange . * Making an emotional withdrawal from the marital relationship . This enables both people to feel comfortable reinvesting in another relationship . Once emotions and logistics are sorted_out , spouses and children can move_into a new kind of family , Benson says .</TEXT>
