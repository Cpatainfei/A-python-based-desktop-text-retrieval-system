   <TEXT> When , in 1988 , the Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature , relatively few Americans were familiar_with his work . Publishers scrambled to issue or reissue several of his 30 novels and 14 collections of short_stories . Thanks in particular to the efforts of editor Jacqueline Onassis , a respectable selection , including the much praised Cairo Trilogy , is currently available in English_language editions . For those not yet initiated into Mahfouz ' s literary vision , &quot; The Harafish &quot; will be a good and relatively easy introduction . Beautifully and simply translated by Catherine Cobham , this multi-generational saga of the al-Nagi family moves at a brisk and compelling clip . Characters sometimes change their lives abruptly , divorcing , marrying and reproducing all_in the space of a single paragraph . Though the pace occasionally leaves the reader breathless -- plagues , children , lifetimes zip_by as if assisted by a fast-forward button -- there are enough particular facts and snippets of dialogue to ground the action and involve the reader . &quot; The Harafish , &quot; a term that means , roughly , the common folk , is as much plot summary as plot , and , in its 10 sequential tales , feels_like the synopsis of an epic rather than the kind of tightly argued novel usually produced in the West . What is sacrificed in complex character development , however , is often balanced by an aura of archetypal significance . The al-Nagis ' destinies rise and fall and rise again with an inexorable narrative force that evokes comparison to fate or parable . Lacking the subtle shading that normally adheres to a character through the gradual accumulation of detail , men and women bloom larger than life : noble , bad , weak , strong , greedy , venal -- all_in neon capital letters . If nothing else , the novel bursts with historical sweep , as if a long , lush carpet were suddenly unrolled down a steep flight of stairs . The story broadly entails the emergence out of obscurity of a patriarch named Ashur , a giant lion of a man whose simplicity is his strength , as well as his weakness . Devoted to the precepts of his Moslem faith , he nevertheless leaves his stalwart wife and older sons to marry a comely bar_girl with whom he launches a complicated , prolific dynasty . Each succeeding set of offspring strays further from the purity of their origins , evolving into protagonists so weak and scheming , cruel and self-aggrandizing as_to be unrecognizable as the descendants of the generous and mostly righteous Ashur . Eventually , as such strings of begats often play_out , the good reasserts itself , producing at the end of the line a larger-than-life figure who ' s the moral equal of the founder . Along the way , Mahfouz takes every opportunity to expose the full range of human foibles and failings , graces and passions . &quot; The Harafish , &quot; at its most page-turning , is sort of like &quot; Dynasty &quot; or &quot; Dallas &quot; crossed with the Old_Testament ( as if they weren ' t already ! ) . Stripped of its exotic settings and unfamiliar surnames , this is , at its pulsing core , a melodrama about lust , money , scandal and the corruption of power -- with a heavy dose of the indomitable human spirit thrown_in for good measure . While by no means the most literary of Mahfouz ' s novels , &quot; The Harafish &quot; is a whirling dervish of a good yarn , the kind of tale Frank Capra could have made into , well , 19 or 20 good , instructive , ultimately uplifting movies . As such , it is unabashedly an example of populist literature -- and a running start into the more intellectually challenging and provocative garden of &quot; The Palace Walk &quot; or &quot; Sugar Street. &quot;</TEXT>
