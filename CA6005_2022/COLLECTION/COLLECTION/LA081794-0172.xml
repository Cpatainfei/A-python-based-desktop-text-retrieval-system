   <HEADLINE> POLES ' NAMING OF EX-SPY TO TOP POST EMBARRASSES U.S. ; ESPIONAGE : WARSAW ' S NEW INTELLIGENCE CHIEF WAS GIVEN LIFE IN PRISON AFTER A LOS ANGELES TRIAL . HE WAS RELEASED IN 1985 AS PART OF A COLD_WAR EXCHANGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an embarrassment for the United States , Poland ' s non-Communist government has named one of the Cold_War era ' s most successful Soviet Bloc spies as head of its civilian intelligence service . Marian Zacharski , 43 , was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States in 1981 for obtaining secret information on the U.S.-made B-1 bomber , the F-15 fighter and radar systems used in Patriot air-defense missiles , then passing the information to the East Bloc . He was sent_back to Poland in 1985 as part of an exchange of four East European spies for 25 Western intelligence_agents who themselves had been convicted and imprisoned in East_Germany and Poland . He received limited clemency from then-President Ronald Reagan . But Justice_Department officials said that , under terms of the exchange , if Zacharski was to return to the United States -- even in his official capacity as Poland ' s intelligence chief -- he would be subject_to arrest and reimprisonment here . &quot; We haven ' t changed our position , &quot; a department spokesman said . The irony does not stop there . Since the late 1980s , when Warsaw shucked off its Communist mantle , Zacharski has become one of Poland ' s leading businessmen -- a director of its most profitable retailing chain , the Pewex import merchandise shops . His years spent in the United States apparently were a learning experience for both sides . His performance in recruiting a disgruntled defense worker as an agent is still being studied at the FBI Academy . And he , in turn , learned American business techniques . Even so , his appointment may prove awkward for both governments . Supported by the United States , Warsaw recently has joined the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program , designed to groom former East Bloc countries for eventual membership in NATO . And Poland has been campaigning hard to become a full-fledged member of the Atlantic military alliance now , rather than after an apprenticeship . &quot; This isn ' t the kind of thing that they ' re likely to put_on their NATO application_form , &quot; one U.S. official said . Washington apparently was taken by surprise when the appointment was disclosed . U.S. officials said the State_Department had not known in_advance that Zacharski would be named to the post , and as of late Tuesday , the Clinton_Administration had not decided how to react . U.S. intelligence officials apparently are urging that Washington not protest strongly , arguing they can work with someone who was in the intelligence business . Still , &quot; it ' s not the greatest thing that can happen , &quot; a U.S. diplomat said . Zacharski was tried and convicted in federal_district court in Los Angeles after having successfully recruited William Holden Bell , a radar system expert at Hughes Aircraft Co . in El Segundo , to provide him with copies of documents in exchange for cash . Bell served as the key prosecution witness in Zacharski ' s trial , after pleading guilty to one count of passing secret documents to foreign_agents , in exchange for a lighter sentence . One reason authorities were able to prosecute Zacharski was that , unlike many spies who arrive in the United States protected by diplomatic immunity , the Pole was working as a civilian as West Coast representative of the Polish-American Machinery Corp . Zacharski ' s appointment was signed Friday by the chief of the State Protection Office , a leading Warsaw daily newspaper reported . News of his appointment was broadcast Tuesday on Polish TV . According to news service reports , at least some Polish security officials and members_of_Parliament voiced surprise and criticism over the promotion of a man who served the former Soviet-controlled intelligence agency , but there was no official reaction to the move .</TEXT>
