   <TEXT> For generations , the muscled fishermen of Brittany have harvested the cold , choppy waters of the Atlantic , relishing the good years and enduring the bad ones to keep seafood on the great tables of France . But all that changed when they went_on strike recently over low prices for imported fish . In one city , 5 # 000 fishermen battled riot police with baseball_bats and iron bars , injuring 134 officers beneath a tear-gas haze . Elsewhere , they cleaned_out supermarket display_cases and warehouses , setting fire to giant mounds of fish . Fisherman Marcel Denic , 36 , warned : &quot; There is no fish storehouse in France that is safe. &quot; His brother , Michel , 45 , a fisherman for three decades , explained : &quot; If we stay silent , nobody will hear us . This causes more attention . And it brings the television cameras. &quot; Indeed it does . The Denics had taken_part in a riot that damaged dozens of cars , stores and telephone_booths . It also inadvertently touched_off a fire that left a 17th-Century Parliament building , Brittany ' s pride , a smoldering ruin . France certainly is no stranger to labor strife or tough talk . But the militant seafarers and their commando actions are part of a new , more belligerent and more desperate phenomenon emerging today : French workers , facing 12 % unemployment , have lost patience with old-fashioned strikes and picket_lines . And they are turning_to increasingly violent ways of holding_on to their jobs . In recent weeks , angry dockworkers in Marseilles have welded shut the gates of a bankrupt port and stopped all ferry traffic between the city and North Africa . Workers at a Tampax factory in the Loire Valley , protesting layoff plans , kidnaped two top managers and held them in their offices for three days . No one has been arrested in the case . &quot; France has always loved reform but hated change , &quot; says Franz-Olivier Giesbert , editor of Le Figaro , the pro-government daily newspaper . &quot; That is why , unlike a lot of other nations , we feel the need occasionally to make a revolution , good or bad , so as_to decompress. &quot; &quot; We are confronted today by social_groups that feel their existence itself is threatened , &quot; says Brice Teinturier , director of the political department at the_French Institute of Public_Opinion . &quot; And , for the most part , the_French sympathize . They feel these are just causes. &quot; The new_wave of violent labor unrest began two years ago with farmers , who blocked traffic , burned produce and clashed repeatedly with police in a dispute over European and American pressure to cut agricultural subsidies . But it has gained momentum since a strike by Air France workers last September , when demonstrators protesting a government plan to lay off 4 # 000 employees from the money-losing airline blocked runways at Charles de Gaulle Airport and waged running battles with riot police . In a way , Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur has fanned the flames of unrest by throwing money and other concessions at the most violent strikers , sending an unmistakable message that the more belligerent the strike , the more likely the government will be to open its pocketbook . Balladur quickly backed_down in the face of the Air France strikers , agreeing to withdraw the airline survival plan . He has taken a series of steps to appease the fishermen too , offering financial_aid for boat loan payments and a five-month ban on the import of cheap fish . And this week he launched a $ 1.8-million radio and billboard ad_campaign , urging the_French to eat more of &quot; our fresh_fish &quot; and reminding consumers that fishermen have to battle rain and worse , &quot; while you were asleep , &quot; to bring_in their precious catch . Some have labeled Balladur ' s strategy le tactique salami , in which he slices off piece after piece of the public_treasury to feed each protesting group . A recent editorial cartoon in Le Monde , the influential Parisian daily , showed Balladur holding a fishing_pole , with money affixed to the hook . &quot; Tell the fishermen I ' m ready , &quot; Balladur calls_out in the cartoon . Balladur , like most top-level politicians in France , has a deep respect for the power of public demonstrations in his country . Still fresh here are the memories of the violent May , 1968 , student protests that led to the retirement of no less formidable a statesman than President Charles de Gaulle . &quot; We ' re a very centralized state , and that creates a certain fear , &quot; said Denis Lacorne , a political analyst at the National Political Science Foundation in Paris . &quot; In the United States , when something goes_wrong , it might cost a company or university president his job . But , in France , it goes right up_to the government. &quot; Although labor strife has intensified in France -- and even though people have died in recent years in strike-related violence in such nations as South_Africa and Nicaragua -- these incidents are rare in most of the world . That is true even in such places as Germany , where social tensions are rising among workers . In the United States , scattered communities have been torn in recent years by bitter disputes where strikers were replaced by so-called scabs , but violence has been relatively limited . Some of America ' s bloodiest labor disputes came_in the late 1800s , including the Haymarket Square riot in Chicago and the Homestead strike against Carnegie Steel in Pennsylvania , which was suppressed after several people died . In the 1930s , probably the worst era of labor strife , sit-down_strikes swept_through steel and auto plants . In America , protesters who resort_to violence are viewed_as &quot; the radical fringe , &quot; said Charles B . Craver , a law professor at George_Washington University in Washington who has studied unions . &quot; Americans are a relatively docile people that way . We tend to go_by the rule of law. &quot; One of the main differences between the labor_movements in France and the United States is that French workers enjoy generous social and economic benefits and view them as a right , Craver said . By contrast , he said , &quot; in our country , workers don ' t think they have a right to health_care or job security . Here , workers are happy if they have a job. &quot; What is remarkable about France ' s current wave of violence is the absence of any criticism of the strikers from the government -- or the citizenry . Indeed , there is widespread sympathy for the workers ' cause . That , along with a long-held distrust of the riot police , explains why the government has been reluctant to arrest the strikers . However , Balladur bristles_at the suggestion that he is trying to buy civil peace . &quot; What do you recommend ? &quot; he snapped_at one reporter . &quot; That I satisfy nobody ? &quot; While sporadic violence has been a feature of labor unrest in France , the number of strikes and the number of violent incidents are_on the rise . The protests have injured hundreds of people , mostly police_officers , and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage . But , so far at least , no one has died and the strikers have kept their protests from spiraling out of control . ( A notable exception was the fire at the Parliament building in Brittany , about which the fishermen seemed genuinely embarrassed . It was set , apparently accidentally , by one of the flares that strikers were setting_off to light_up the night sky. ) Of course , the current unrest doesn ' t approach the magnitude of the 1968 student uprising , which eventually led 10 million workers to stage strikes and occupy factories . Even amid those clashes , only one person died . &quot; One must remember that the right to strike is something very strongly embedded in the_French , &quot; said Teinturier , the poll specialist . &quot; It has been the main way of social gain for a very long time. &quot; But no one denies that the tone has changed , becoming more desperate and less easily doused by police water_cannons . &quot; Of course , we are taught in school to respect the law . But this is not a question of respect for the law , &quot; said Rene Mouriaux , director_of_research at the Center for the Study of French Political Life in Paris . &quot; These are reactions to things imposed from outside France -- fish imports , farm imports. &quot; And many French workers believe that they already have made financial sacrifices but have little to show for it . &quot; That pushes them toward harder strikes , &quot; Mouriaux added . &quot; Now each group feels the need to pressure the government to get their own piece of the pie. &quot; that ' s what the fishermen-commandos were thinking when they laid siege to the countryside earlier this month . They ended a two-week strike after the series of government concessions , but the message was clear : The threat of civil unrest pays . &quot; It ' s very sad that we ' ve nearly arrived_at the year 2000 and we ' re still reduced to this type of action , &quot; said Serge Nedelec , a 40-year-old fisherman . Behind him , a heavy mist hung over the hundreds of boats in the Guilvinec port , which had been blocked the night before with a long chain marked by blue buoys . &quot; We are up against the wall , &quot; he added , pausing to light a cheap , crumpled corn-leaf cigarette . &quot; The government told us not to break things . But it was only when we started to break things that the government started taking action. &quot; Jean-Michel Coic , 38 , who owns one of the boats in Guilvinec , said the clashes with police were &quot; just an alarm_bell . Maybe it wasn ' t justified , but that ' s the only way . The government has known for a long_time that we have serious problems. &quot; Like other fishermen , Coic blames European trade agreements that have removed French barriers to cheaper imports . France has about 16 # 000 skippers and sailors on 7 # 000 fishing_boats , and they lead a difficult existence . They often spend several weeks at_sea , returning to the market and an on-the-spot division of the proceeds . If the price is too low to meet costs , as it has been since last month , they earn nothing . About a third of the annual catch is exported , mostly to Spain and Italy , but those markets have been hurt by a strong French_franc . The remainder is consumed in France , as part of a national network of shops offering 25 species of fresh_fish daily . About half of the fish consumed in France these days , though , is imported , mostly from Britain , Norway and Denmark . Sole from the_Netherlands , for example , typically sells for as little as $ 4 a pound at French fish stores , compared to about $ 6 a pound for French sole . During their demonstrations , the fishermen tore_down traffic_lights , pulled bricks from city streets , seized fish from delivery_trucks and foreign trawlers and destroyed hundreds of tons of fish . At Rungis , the giant food market known as the &quot; belly of Paris , &quot; more_than 1 # 000 fishermen broke_in shortly after 3 a.m. one day this month and managed to destroy nearly 500 tons of fish , both French and imported , before police arrived . Fishermen also broke_into dozens of supermarkets across central France , trashing the frozen fish counters . Edouard Leclerc , the owner of several hundred supermarkets in France , filed suit against the government and announced stepped-up security at his stores . He even tore_up an agreement he had made with the fishermen last year to buy_at least half his fish from French sources . And he warned endive and cauliflower producers that , if they made_good on threats to follow the fishermen ' s example , &quot; you won ' t find one endive or head of cauliflower in my shops for a month. &quot; But France ' s sympathy remains with the fishermen . Even Balladur told them , &quot; I hope that your children will feel_like doing the same job as you in the future. &quot; Not much chance of that , the fishermen say . Bernard Peillon , a stocky , silver-haired man of 51 , is the 14th generation of Breton fishermen in his family . &quot; But this is the last one , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve never even allowed my son to get_on board a boat. &quot; &quot; Maybe our grandson will become a sailor , &quot; his wife , Annie , added with a rueful laugh . &quot; Or a windsurfer. &quot; Times staff writer Stuart Silverstein contributed to this story .</TEXT>
