   <HEADLINE> BATTLES ROCK AFGHAN CAPITAL FOR THIRD DAY ; REVOLT : THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS IT HAS BEATEN OFF COUP ATTEMPT BY FORMER COMMUNIST LEADERS AND DISAFFECTED PREMIER . BUT FIGHTING CONTINUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Afghan capital was blasted with rockets and mortar bombs for a third straight day Monday , but the government claimed to have beaten off a coup attempt by former Communist leaders and the discontented prime_minister . The situation in Kabul is &quot; under_control , &quot; asserted Eshan Jan Areef , charge d ' affaires at Afghanistan ' s embassy here . The forces fighting against President Burhanuddin Rabbani , he said , &quot; must be crushed. &quot; News_agencies said over 70 people had been killed and about 700 wounded in the factional warfare that erupted in Kabul before dawn on New Year ' s Day , although definite figures were impossible to get . In a statement , the Afghan Foreign Ministry said only &quot; minor resistance &quot; was being experienced in Kabul proper on Monday . In fact , scores of rockets and artillery rounds rained_down on government and military buildings and residential_districts alike . Jets from the government ' s air_force counterattacked , bombing the rebel stronghold at the ancient Bala Hissar fort south of Kabul . Rabbani ' s official palace and its grounds were struck many times by rockets and explosive shells . But observers said his forces appeared to still be in control of most of the key locations in the city , the presidential palace included . Officials in Rabbani ' s government accused Abdul Rashid Dostum , a general during the days of Afghanistan ' s pro-Soviet Communist regime , of joining forces with disaffected Prime_Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar ' s hard-line Hezb-i-Islami group , which is headquartered 15 miles southeast of Kabul . Another alleged party to the &quot; shameless conspiracy &quot; to grab control of the country ' s most important city was Mahmood Baryalai , brother of Afghanistan ' s former pro-Soviet puppet ruler Babrak Karmal , the Foreign Ministry charged . Denouncing as &quot; un-Islamic &quot; the attempt to unseat him , Rabbani appealed Sunday to other parties in the fractious coalition government to join him and wage jihad ( holy war ) against the guerrillas . The Foreign Ministry statement blasted Hekmatyar for being ready to make common cause with the Communists whom he and other leaders of the Muslim resistance had fought courageously for years . But the Reuters news_agency quoted one of Dostum ' s senior commanders as saying that ethnic grievances , not economics or religion , were the real reason for the revolt against the president . &quot; We carried_out the attack because we wanted to change the political_system in Afghanistan , &quot; said the commander , identified only as Gen . Fauzi . &quot; Rabbani is running the country only in favor of the Tajiks. &quot; Dostum and his fighters are Uzbeks , a minority that lives in Afghanistan ' s north . Afghanistan ' s Islamic militias formed a coalition government after ousting the Soviet-backed regime of President Najibullah in 1992 . But they have since turned their guns on each other , and at least 10 # 000 people have died .</TEXT>
