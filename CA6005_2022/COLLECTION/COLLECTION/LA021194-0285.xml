   <HEADLINE> CATEGORY THAT ALMOST WASN ' T NARROWS FIELD ; OSCARS : THE SHORT-LIVED DEATH_KNELL FOR SHORT FILMS PROBABLY HELPED SHRINK THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES . ONLY THREE DOCUMENTARY NOMINEES WERE SELECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He may_not be as famous as most of the other Academy Award candidates , but Steven Cantor ' s telephone has been ringing madly with calls from agents , producers , directors and journalists ever since the nominations were announced Wednesday morning . &quot; Taylor Hackford woke me up this morning , &quot; Cantor , 26 , said Thursday , referring to the director of &quot; An Officer and a Gentleman. &quot; Cantor ' s 30-minute film , &quot; Blood Ties : The Life and Work of Sally Mann , &quot; was one of three short documentaries nominated in a category that was almost wiped_out by the academy last year . Earlier this month , the organization ' s board of governors reversed itself , voting unanimously to continue recognizing both short documentaries and short live-action ( fictional ) films . It is unusual , though not unprecedented , for only three films to be selected out of a possible five in the short-documentary category . This has occurred only three other times since 1955 ( in 1957 , no films were nominated ) . Five films were nominated in the live-action category . Freida Lee Mock , who chairs the academy ' s documentary screening committee , said last year ' s announced death_knell for short films probably helped shrink the number of entries . This year , only 16 short documentaries were entered , while usually there are from 30 to 40 submissions . &quot; Many of us surmised that a major contributing factor was the confusion caused by the controversy , &quot; Mock said . Another factor , she pointed_out , may have been her committee ' s decision to tighten eligibility requirements . For example , a film can still qualify if it has been shown at a festival , but the list of approved festivals has been cut_back , she said . Academy spokesman Bob Werden praised the committee for limiting its selections rather than trying to bend its standards . &quot; If they had been political they could have pushed in five , &quot; he said . * For one of the nominees , good news arrived even before the academy selections were made . A production company headed by Rosalie Swedlin has been negotiating with Disney ' s Hollywood Pictures to make a feature_film based on former USC film student Elaine Holliman ' s &quot; Chicks in White Satin. &quot; Holliman ' s documentary , which screened at the recent Sundance Film Festival in Park City , Utah , is about two lesbians who decide to formalize their eight-year relationship with a commitment ceremony . As part of the deal , Holliman will co-write and direct the film , according to a spokeswoman for Swedlin ' s Longview Entertainment Co . Holliman , who left for Germany to show the 20-minute short at the Berlin Film Festival , could not be reached . The third nominee in the short documentary category is &quot; Defending Our Lives , &quot; produced by Cambridge Documentary_Films , a Massachusetts-based group that has been making social-issue films for 17 years but has never before received an academy nomination . The film , budgeted at $ 135 # 000 , records the experiences of battered women who were convicted of killing their mates despite a claim of self-defense . It was made in conjunction with Battered Women Fighting Back , a nonprofit group . Co-producer Margaret Lazarus said the nomination will mean much greater exposure for her cause . &quot; It means that many_more people will see this documentary , and hopefully they will get a greater understanding of domestic violence and be in a position to stop the cycle , &quot; she said . Cantor , producer of the Sally Mann film , said the project originally began as a documentary about censorship . After interviewing Mann , a prominent photographer who has been criticized for taking nude pictures of her young daughters , he decided instead to concentrate_on her . &quot; I grew_up in New York , in an artistically oriented family , but I had never been so moved by any artist , &quot; he said . Now a USC film student , Cantor said his film cost $ 4 # 000 , excluding perhaps $ 30 # 000 worth of free services provided by a New York editing facility . Documentary filmmaker Mark Mori ( &quot; Building Bombs &quot; ) was so impressed with the film that he raised $ 11 # 000 from a foundation in_order to give the film wider exposure , Cantor said . As he continued to field calls , Cantor expressed delight that the academy chose to abandon its original decision to drop short films . &quot; What this category does is provide_for young and not very well-financed filmmakers a chance to have access to a large public and to be seen by the industry , &quot; Cantor said .</TEXT>
