   <HEADLINE> A FABLE FOR OUR TROUBLED TIMES ; REBIRTH : AFTER FIRE AND RAIN , RIOTS AND QUAKES , A NEW AGE DAWNETH FOR MALIBITES , BEVITES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> And in the days before the Bobbitt and the Harding , whilst mad King Rodney careened with his chariots down the 210 past the towers of Megiddo to the Valley ; before King Bradley banged his head against the city ' s Gates whilst gangbangers banged elsewhere ; before Michael and the Men of Endez and Heidi were brought low , and Riordan , Feinstein and Boxer raised on high ; lo , even then , the Lord hardened his heart against the City of Angels , against the Malibites and Bevites , the Westsiders and the Valleyites ; yea , even unto the chariot makers of Orange County and Van Nuys , and there was a scourge upon the land . And the Lord said unto the denizens of the South , behold , though ye have waged my battles faithfully , I shall rust thy swords and diffuse thy lasers ; neither shall thy patriots fly true nor thy spysats see straight . For thou hast become too proud in thy victory -- and this Bush that burns brightly without being consumed , neither by Irangate nor by the vision thing , is the worst offender . For this , thy weapons shall become as a glut upon the market . Neither shall thee make batteries for thy cars nor shall thee cobble chips for Nippon . And a smoggy pall fell upon the land , and the hammers became still , and home equity became as for naught . And the Lord then said unto Daryl , stretch_out thy Rod and smite this man of Cush in the kidneys , that he might feel the billy club of G-d . But an Evil_Eye beheld this travesty , and the people rose_up in anger , and the city burned and gave_up its treasures . And Daryl ' s corporals stood silent and sullen , for their E-mail system worked not , and they knew not of any beating or mayhem and heard not of this Denny . And , as the judges pondered , there was a wailing from Sou ' Central and Simi to Seoul . And the Lord said unto a schizoid shepherd in the_hills of Moab , rise_up early in the morning and light thy campfire and cast its sparks upon the brush , and I will send swarms of Santa Anas to give them succor . And the land was ruined by fire whilst the Malibites gnashed their teeth . But when the smoke cleared , the Lord hardened their hearts . And though their sages said rebuild not , for neither man nor beast may dwell safely in these places , they flocked back through the Valley of Topanga unto the waters of the Dead_Sea . And though their wells of Perrier were tainted with benzene , and tasted as of blood , they set_up their tents and renewed their cable service . And the Lord spake unto the mountains and said , take_to ye handfuls of mud and throw these upon the proud and stubborn Malibites , that muck might bury their tents and clog_up their Porsches . And a great rain came , and it fell 40 days and 40 nights , and many_a screenplay and treatment was blotted_out . And the Malibites wailed , for lo , this was worse than the Writers Guild strike . And the word of the Lord went_out from the bowels of the Earth saying , &quot; Son of man , try this on for size. &quot; And while babes and their mothers slept ; lo , even before the joggers became as a pestilence in the streets , there came a roar from the Earth , and a great quaking , and though it wasn ' t the Big One , it was a real pisser . And the Malibites delivered up their firstborn for their Evian , and they said , &quot; thus plagueth the Lord our land , verily as he smote Pharoah only 200 years ago , &quot; for they knew not history , though they quoteth box_office unto the 10th decimal . But when the pall upon the land seemed at its darkest , and all equity was lost , there came_out of the East a host of legions . From the empire of the Beltway came the princes Fema and S ' Ba and Irs . And they bore gifts of grants and loans and deductions , and said lo , though thy sins may_not be forgiven , fear not the cracks in thy firmaments , for verily shall be thy debts . And from the wasted reaches of Miami and St . Louis came the hosts of Aetna and Prudential and Farmers , each bearing a piece of the rock . And they brought glad tidings and big bundles too , for the PR opportunities were enormous . Unto the stricken they said , despair not of thy deductibles , for those who have paid tribute shall be rewarded . And as by magic , scratched kitchen tiles became as gaping maws , tiny dents in the garden furniture as great detonations . And though most of the people had not paid tribute to these princes , and received not such heaps , these riches multiplied as the stars in the sky . And across the land , pundits spake of a New Age . Crystals and Powerbooks and surfboards and rollerblades and other goodies not seen since the days of the Garden appeared as though manna_from_Heaven . Some even beseeched the Home Shopping Network for bee bonnets and snowmobiles and inflatable life_rafts . Because in California , thou never knowest .</TEXT>
