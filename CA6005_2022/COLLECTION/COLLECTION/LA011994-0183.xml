   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; TEMBLOR IS REMINDER TO O.C. OF ITS OWN FAULT ; SEISMOLOGY : IT UNDERLINES NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FISSURE ' S POTENCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> According to Mark Johnson ' s personal seismic meter -- a stairwell chandelier that smashed against a window in his home during Monday ' s violent earthquake -- the 4:31 a.m. temblor was the strongest he has experienced in four years in Orange County . For Johnson , manager of the Orange County Fire_Department ' s emergency management division , the quake served as a powerful reminder of the destructive potential of the Newport-Inglewood Fault_line , which stretches under some of the most populous areas of Orange and Los Angeles counties . The Northridge quake , which rumbled up from a previously unknown fault in the San Fernando Valley , causing 40 deaths and extensive damage , should underline to Orange County officials and residents that they , too , sit atop a potentially deadly geological crease , Johnson and others said Tuesday . The two faults are not connected . &quot; Anytime we have an earthquake , it is a reminder of the threat that we face here , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; But this one yesterday was a better lesson for us for several reasons -- because of its proximity and the way it impacted people here , and because of the similarity here to the population density in the valley. &quot; Geologists have long warned that even a moderate shaker on the Newport-Inglewood Fault , which cuts a 40-mile subterranean path from Newport Beach through Long_Beach and north to Beverly Hills , could result in a greater loss of life than a more serious quake along the better-known San Andreas Fault . The Newport fault runs_along the coastline , under more densely populated areas that sit atop sandy soil , which would prove unstable during a quake . In a 1988 report , experts with the state division of mines and geology warned that a quake of magnitude 7.0 on the Newport-Inglewood Fault &quot; poses one of the greatest hazards to lives and property in the nation. &quot; &quot; Everyone talks_about the Big One and the San Andreas , but we are far away from the San Andreas , &quot; said Medhat Haroun , chairman of UCI ' s Civil and Environmental Engineering Department . &quot; We can get potentially more damage from a magnitude 7 earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood than a magnitude 8 on the San Andreas. &quot; The Newport-Inglewood Fault , the only major one in the county , is_best known for causing the 1933 Long_Beach earthquake , which killed more_than 100 people and resulted in millions of dollars in damage . Jim Davis , a geologist with the California Department of Conservation , the parent agency of the division of mines and geology , stressed that the Long_Beach temblor , which measured 6.3 on the Richter scale , also was considered to be of moderate size . In the aftermath of Monday ' s quake , which caused comparatively little damage in Orange County , Johnson said the emergency management division already had begun to study the preliminary seismic data and damage estimates in_order to glean any information that might be useful to the county ' s emergency planning . In terms of lessons for Orange County , the quake -- delivered by a fault that runs under populous areas of the northwest San Fernando Valley -- may provide a far more useful example than if it had occurred along the bigger San Andreas Fault , about 60 miles east of Los Angeles , Johnson said . Times staff writer Jeff Brazil contributed to this report . Deadly Fault Zone The Newport-Inglewood Fault covers a relatively short distance , but is considered potentially deadly because it runs_through a densely populated area .</TEXT>
