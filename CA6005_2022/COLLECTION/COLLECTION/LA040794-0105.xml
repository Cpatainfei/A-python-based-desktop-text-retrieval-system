   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OXNARD ; WORKERS PROTEST RANCHER ' S SENTENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Farm_workers and their advocates gathered_in Oxnard on Wednesday to protest a reduced sentence handed_down earlier this week to a Somis flower rancher originally charged with enslaving farm_workers . U . S . District Judge Consuelo B . Marshall changed the three-year prison sentence of Edwin M . Ives , 57 , to one year in a halfway house and two years of house_arrest under electronic_surveillance . &quot; How can there be one standard of justice for those who have money and one for those who don ' t , &quot; said Karl Lawson , a former United Farm_Workers union employee , one of about a dozen people who protested the change of sentence . Ives was initially sentenced in September after he pleaded guilty to seven criminal violations of labor and immigration law , including transporting and harboring undocumented immigrants and paying less than minimum_wage . Although prosecutors dropped the slavery charge in a plea bargain , they have continued to argue that Ives virtually imprisoned the laborers he recruited from rural Mexican villages . Ives has remained free pending a requested change of sentence . On Monday , Marshall changed the sentence , saying that Ives ' imprisonment would cost dozens more farm_workers their jobs . Emanuel Benitez , a community worker for California Rural Legal Assistance , said many farm_workers believed Ives ' original three-year prison sentence was too light . &quot; But they felt that at least the message it would send to growers and the farm_worker community is that this abuse cannot be tolerated , &quot; Benitez said . &quot; Now this is sending the wrong message. &quot; Luis Teran , a disabled celery worker from Oxnard , said Ives should not be allowed to escape prison time . &quot; I believe that for our people there are no laws , &quot; Teran said . &quot; I believe the law works only for the rich. &quot; FRED ALVAREZ</TEXT>
