   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; EU HAS CHANGE OF HEART TOWARD NATIONS TO EAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the massive street protests that accompanied Eastern Europe ' s anti-Communist revolutions during the fall of 1989 , demonstrators frequently carried with them a blue_flag bearing a circle of 12 gold stars . The flag -- that of the 12-nation European Union , formerly the European Community -- symbolized the aspirations of those from the long-oppressed East , not just to partake of the affluence that has come_to characterize the social_democracies of Western Europe but also to embrace the values of a union built_on free-market economics , political consensus and social justice . The hard realities that have followed in the years since have been tough to digest even for the most optimistic Eastern Europeans . The EU quickly restricted access to its own markets by the struggling new democracies , slapping protective_tariffs on key products such_as steel and agricultural goods and generally treating its newly free eastern neighbors as poor , unexpected relatives . To be sure , the union has been the largest single aid donor to the former Soviet satellite states , giving them $ 24 billion through last June . It has entered into formal &quot; association &quot; agreements with five countries to intensify economic cooperation and political dialogue . And 17 months ago , the organization accepted the principle of eventual full membership for Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- although the commitment seemed halfhearted and the timing vague . In recent months , however , the EU ' s attitude has changed -- dramatically . Spurred mainly by growing fears about the future stability of Russia and nudged firmly by the union ' s most ardent expansionist , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , the EU is launching a drive to lock the east in a secure embrace and bury the continent ' s old East-West divide . The sense of urgency in the recently completed negotiations to admit Sweden , Norway , Finland and Austria stems in part from the belief that the addition of the four rich states is essential to counterbalance the impact of the EU ' s next enlargement -- certain to include at least some of the struggling eastern democracies . &quot; We must move more quickly , &quot; declared EU Executive Commission President Jacques Delors , referring to the union ' s relations with the new eastern democracies . &quot; We have to demonstrate that we take them seriously. &quot; * At a news_conference in Bonn last week , Kohl added , &quot; It would be intolerable for us to adopt an attitude that we wanted to create some sort of closed shop. &quot; Kohl ' s remarks came_on the same day the EU ' s 17 commissioners came_together here in a special half-day meeting to review a detailed proposal for forging closer ties with six eastern countries -- Bulgaria , Romania and the four nations expected to join first -- all once part of the Soviet Bloc . The proposal , which includes a sharp rollback of the EU ' s trade restrictions , an end to EU subsidies for agricultural products exported to the east , an $ 8-billion , five-year aid program aimed mainly at improving roads and other communications links with Western Europe , and a much closer political dialogue , is expected to form an important part of the union ' s work when Germany takes_over the rotating presidency in July . Germany is the nation most committed to the EU ' s swift enlargement to the east . Indeed , Kohl last week indicated that he would like to see Polish , Czech , Hungarian and Slovak leaders attending the EU ' s semiannual summit_meetings in an observer status . But most heartening of all for the eastern countries is the shift in tone within the EU on full membership . Instead of loosely worded references_to &quot; around the turn_of_the_century , &quot; EU leaders now talk in more concrete terms . &quot; The union ( should ) fix a date -- 1997 seems reasonable -- to review progress toward membership , &quot; commented EU External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek in a speech last month . For some , even this timetable is slow . Sitting beside Delors at a news_conference here last month , Czech Prime_Minister Vaclav Klaus demanded his country be included immediately in a free-trade zone with the EU . As if to echo this urgency , Hungary formally applied for EU membership on Friday , and Poland is expected to follow later this month .
