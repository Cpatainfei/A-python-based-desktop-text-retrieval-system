   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NOT ALL IN YOUR HEAD ; CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF , ULCERS ARE THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY BACTERIA RATHER THAN EMOTIONS AND STRESS . ANTIBIOTICS MAY HOLD THE CURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talk_about stigma : Ask any ulcer patient . Sometime after saying hello , the average person asks someone with stomach pain , decreased appetite , heartburn and nausea a psychological questions : &quot; Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? &quot; &quot; Have you been tense ? &quot; People often worry that their stomach problems are caused by their fast-track jobs or busy schedules , and some are embarrassed that they have not yet learned to deal with the rigors of their lives , said Dr. Gerald Green , an Encino-based gastroenterologist and chief_of_staff at Encino / Tarzana Regional Medical_Center . But the latest research blames bacteria -- not attitude , coping skills or personality . Scientists have learned that a bacterial organism called Helicobacter pylori is almost always the cause of stomach and duodenal ulcers , said Green , who is also a clinical professor of medicine at USC . &quot; Evidence that stress is related to ulcers is not there , &quot; Green said . &quot; People under stress may develop a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms , such_as dyspepsia or irritable_bowel_syndrome -- but not ulcers. &quot; Researchers at a wide range of medical_centers have shown that antibiotics , either given alone or in combination with a bismuth agent -- such_as Pepto-Bismol -- can cure ulcers by eliminating the Helicobacter infection . Green said that , before this discovery -- since the 1970s -- people with uncomplicated peptic_ulcers were typically put_on a drug such_as cimetadine ( Tagamet ) , which would resolve about 90 % of the ulcers within four to eight weeks . But as_many as 70 % of the ulcers would recur , which would force the patients to go_back to the $ 30-a-month drug regimen , often indefinitely . Patients would often blame their psychological status rather than the treatment plan for their protracted illness , he said . When antibiotics are given instead of Tagamet , ulcers return in only 10 % of the cases , Green said . Although this information has been widely published in the medical literature , many people are unaware of the new approach , said Lois Pound , a registered nurse and coordinator of the GI / Endoscopy Center at Northridge Hospital Medical_Center . &quot; Patients have no idea ; they think it ' s all about stress or diet , &quot; she said . There are several simple ways to check for the presence of the bacteria , including a blood_test and a breath test that checks for a complex chemical_reaction that occurs when Helicobacter is present , said Green . The organism is found in 90 % of the people with duodenal ulcers and in as_many as 80 % of those with stomach ulcers , according to some studies . The presence of Helicobacter in the stomach tends to be more common as people get older , said Green . &quot; In certain populations , more_than 50 % of those over age 50 have the bacteria present , yet less than 10 % of children are found to have the bacteria , &quot; he said . The vast majority of people eventually develop the infection but no symptoms , according to Green . Those who have the bacteria and also smoke or take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory_drugs -- such_as Motrin or aspirin -- have a greater risk of developing an ulcer than do others . Ulcers are common . In the United States , about one in 10 people at some time in their lives will develop a duodenal ulcer , and one in 30 will get a gastric_ulcer , according to the American Medical Assn . Dr. Neil Fagen , a gastroenterologist in Northridge , suggests that people with stomach symptoms first try over-the-counter remedies and then see their health practitioner if symptoms persist or if there is a family history of ulcers .</TEXT>
