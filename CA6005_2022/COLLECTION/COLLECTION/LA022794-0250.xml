   <TEXT> The peasant girl Fan Xianxiu began her journey into bondage a year ago as she walked the unfamiliar streets of this southwestern provincial_capital in search of a job . Two women befriended Fan . They bought her new clothes and persuaded her to join them on a trip north . When they got_off the train in Inner Mongolia , two men were waiting to take them to a nearby village . There , to Fan ' s shock , a skinny and lame 24-year-old peasant paid her four companions $ 483 , the price of a good color_television , to take her for his wife . &quot; He said he was so ugly that none of the local women wanted to marry him , &quot; Fan recalled . Her voice was soft and she looked every bit the 16-year-old naif with her ponytail and bangs hanging over her baby face . Today , Fan is back in Chengdu . Police rescued her from a life of bondage that has become all too common in modern China . Waiting at a government holding center to be reunited with relatives , she recounted her harrowing tale . Fan told of the nights she was forced to sleep_with the man who purchased her , the days she was shadowed by his relatives to prevent her from running_away , the few moments by herself when all she could do was pray her ordeal would soon end . As she spoke , haltingly , in flat , short sentences , she squeezed the hand of a comforting friend . &quot; I was brokenhearted , &quot; she said . &quot; I hoped I could get_back to Sichuan as fast as possible. &quot; In imperial China , women were commonly sold to be wives , concubines or prostitutes . The communists ended that after taking power in 1949 . But the breakup of farming communes , which doubled as powerful local_governments , and the partial return of a market_economy has eroded Communist_Party control in the countryside and led to a resurgence of human trafficking . There are many reasons for the problem . Paying a family to wed their daughter is back in fashion , and men who cannot afford that often find it cheaper to buy a bride from kidnapers . Men from remote villages sometimes find that local women won ' t have them . Criminal gangs find easy kidnap targets among the millions of poor peasants who flood the cities in search of work . Fan , who was sold into a relatively well-off household and was never beaten , fared far better than many other abducted women . &quot; The personal freedom of most kidnaped women has been restricted , most of them have been bitterly beaten , some of them have been raped and some have been resold on many occasions , &quot; the state-run Inner Mongolia Daily reported recently . More_than 50 # 000 cases of abducted women and children were reported in 1991-92 , the last years for which statistics are available , a spokesman for the national police said . The actual number of kidnapings is undoubtedly higher since not all are reported . Although many of the women are abducted from Chengdu and elsewhere in the southwestern province of Sichuan , the provincial police refused to discuss the issue . But one need only travel about an hour from Chengdu and listen to the people of Taihua village to understand just how pervasive the problem is . Listen to Nong Ziying , who believes her 16-year-old daughter ' s disappearance five years ago must have been an abduction : &quot; I went_to Chengdu a lot of times , but I didn ' t find_out anything , &quot; said Nong , 46 , standing by a field of young green wheat as she clutched a tiny black-and-white photo of her daughter . &quot; Of course I cried . . . I think_of her a lot , but there ' s nothing I can do. &quot; Then there ' s Zhen Shufang . She is so petrified that her only child , an 18-year-old daughter , will become the next victim , that she doesn ' t let her leave home . Zhen spends the day doing embroidery behind barred windows . &quot; Girls that age are easily tricked , &quot; the mother said . &quot; They can be kidnaped and sold. &quot; One village girl was abducted and sold to a peasant in another province before being rescued and returned home . Her parents tracked her down and coaxed police with gifts of cigarettes to help bring her back . The central government clearly wants to crack_down on the kidnapings . They not only are embarrassing to a ruling Communist_Party that stresses sexual equality but also provide ammunition to international critics of China ' s human_rights policies . Authorities have enacted tough anti-abduction laws and executed some kidnapers . In 1991-92 , police rescued about 44 # 000 abducted women and children and arrested about 75 # 000 members of kidnap gangs , the Public_Security Ministry said . Fan Xianxiu was rescued late last year when Inner Mongolia police swept_through her village looking_for kidnaped women as part of a provincial campaign against abductions . She was among nearly 60 kidnaped Sichuanese brought_back from the north to Chengdu in mid-January . She said the man who held her for eight months on the final day &quot; urged me to stay . I said I wasn ' t coming_back . Of course he was angry. &quot; Several of the other women owed their return more to personal courage than police work . One , a penniless 15-year-old surnamed Yang , traveled about 60 miles in frigid weather after escaping_from the man who bought her . She reached the safety of police in Jilin , a northern provincial_capital , after seven days on_the_road , sustained by the kindness of peasants who took her in at night . For all_the kidnaped women and children who are rescued , countless more never go_home . The women who made_it back to Chengdu said there were many_more purchased wives still living_in the villages up north . Some victims are so fearful of being caught and beaten they never try to escape . Others choose to stay , those who have borne children or find their new surroundings more comfortable than their impoverished home villages . Abducted women also may find themselves stigmatized if they return home . Parents often reject them , husbands divorce them . For now , with booming urban_areas continuing to lure poor peasant women , it may be difficult for authorities to snuff_out the abduction epidemic . Young country women seeking work as maids or factory_workers continue to crowd an illegal job market at Chengdu ' s Nine-Eyes Bridge , a favorite hunting_ground for wife-traffickers . Police efforts to close the market have failed . Posted signs and broadcasts warning of abductors on the prowl don ' t seem to frighten the young_women , who believe they will be able to spot trouble if it comes . In fact , they sound a bit like Fan Xianxiu , bundled in a red sweater against the winter cold . She ' ll soon be looking_for work again , she said . &quot; Of course I won ' t be fooled again , &quot; she insisted . But when asked how she will spot potential abductors , she groped_for an answer : &quot; As long as I ' m careful , it ' ll be all right. &quot;</TEXT>
