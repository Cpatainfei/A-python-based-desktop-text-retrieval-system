   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY_COUNCIL ; VOTERS PRESS 16 CANDIDATES TO CHOOSE SIDES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They liken their current city leaders to a pack of kids squabbling in a sandbox , or a bunch of jokers squandering tax dollars , or a passel of wonks drafting nit-picky rules . Yet though they bash them , they can ' t wait to join them . Fourteen challengers have set their sights on the much-maligned Thousand Oaks City_Council this year . They will square_off against incumbents Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah in November as they vie for three open seats , including one left vacant by Mayor Alex Fiore ' s retirement . With campaigning that began even before the traditional Labor_Day kickoff , the challengers are cooking_up snappy slogans and tossing around political promises . But no matter how many initiatives they propose , voters seem to nag them with one vexing question : Which side are you on ? After two years of watching the council split 3 to 2 on most major issues , voters seem to expect the candidates to line_up behind one camp or another . And so they demand : Do you agree with the slow-growth views of Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski ? Or do you support the more pro-development attitude of Fiore , Lazar and Councilman Frank Schillo ? Which side are you on ? Answers depend_on campaign strategy . Roughly half the candidates have chosen to hitch themselves to either the &quot; 3-side &quot; or the &quot; 2-side. &quot; The rest hope to convince voters that they ' re true independents . Lining_up with the slow-growth faction are : David Hare , an environmental services manager for the city of West Hollywood ; M . Ali Issari , a retired filmmaker who has been endorsed by Zeanah , and Irving Wasserman , who was appointed to the Planning_Commission by Zeanah four years ago . Candidates in the other camp include : Marshall Dixon , a retired businessman who strongly defends developers ' rights to build_on their property ; Jeannette Scovill , a public-access television producer and environmental activist , and Bill Williams , a mortgage broker who has criticized Zeanah and Zukowski as &quot; reactionary. &quot; Reluctant to be pinned_down , the remaining candidates seek to portray themselves as neutral -- or at least unpredictable in their allegiances : dentist Gregory Cole , firefighter Andy Fox , finance manager Michael V . Friedman , engineer and former Councilman Lee Laxdal , police Detective Michael Markey , real_estate salesman Chuck Morsa , telecommunications salesman Ekbal Quidwai and mobile carwash owner Lance Winslow . Even Lazar , who has sided with her pro-development colleagues on most issues , has tried to slough off labels . &quot; If anything , &quot; she said , &quot; I ' d like to be considered practical and reasonable . That means making adjustments , because you can ' t have it all your way. &quot; That emphasis on negotiation and compromise is quickly becoming the most popular slogan in the campaign . Nearly every candidate has endorsed an &quot; anti-bickering &quot; platform , promising to put an end to the personal attacks and vicious arguments that have come_to characterize the televised council meetings . &quot; People ask , ' What makes you think you won ' t get embroiled in the same kind of controversy ? ' &quot; said candidate Lee Laxdal , who served on the council from 1980 to 1989 . &quot; The answer is , you vote issues , not people , and you treat everyone with respect. &quot; * To back_up his claims , Laxdal points to his nine years of service on an often-divided but rarely rancorous council . Similarly , former Planning_Commission members Andy Fox and Greg Cole tout themselves as experienced peacemakers with a proven ability to keep debates focused_on the issues . &quot; You can ' t just rush_off and say , ' No , ' and you can ' t just rush_off and say , ' Yes , ' &quot; Cole said . &quot; that ' s the problem with the current council -- they don ' t listen. &quot; The fourth challenger with government experience , Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman , also describes himself as a good negotiator and an all-around &quot; people person. &quot; While Cole , Dixon , Fox , Laxdal and Wasserman emphasize their experience within the Thousand Oaks bureaucracy , their foes seek support by positioning themselves as complete outsiders , with no allegiances and no agendas . &quot; I ' m hearing that voters would like to have_young , new people on the council , &quot; said Michael Friedman , who ' s trying to spin his obscurity into an advantage . At age 27 , Friedman is the youngest council candidate ; David Hare and Lance Winslow are also under 30 . Three senior_citizens are running as well : Dixon recently turned 69 , and both Issari and Wasserman are 72 . Even with such wide age gaps and diverse backgrounds , the candidates worry that voters will find it tough to pick them from the crowded field . To ensure they stand_out in voters ' minds , most candidates plan on a lot of old-fashioned handshaking . Walking door to door , precinct by precinct , they will hand_out brochures and flash sincere smiles . &quot; I ' ve got holes in my shoes already , &quot; said Winslow , who ' s been canvassing three hours a day . New shoe_leather , however , will be a minor_expense compared to the campaign budgets of most candidates . Conejo Valley Chamber_of_Commerce President Steve Rubenstein estimates that it will take at least $ 25 # 000 to win election . Even the incumbents say they expect to spend heavily . Although both Lazar and Zeanah enjoy widespread name recognition , they ' re not counting_on automatic reelection . They well remember how voters booted_out incumbents Bob Lewis in 1992 and Larry Horner in 1990 . &quot; I know this is going_to be a hard-waged campaign , &quot; Zeanah said . &quot; I ' m going_to put all_the energy I have into this election effort. &quot; * Anticipating the high costs , several candidates began amassing war_chests months ago and are continuing to round_up cash . Most will continue to host the traditional , fund-raising barbecues , picnics and cocktail_parties at $ 10 to $ 25 a plate . But Andy Fox , gunning for heftier contributions , has organized a golf tournament this fall with a $ 65 entry fee -- and the lure of a free car for any player who makes a hole in one . On the other end of the scale , Lance Winslow hopes residents will pledge a_few pennies for every car he washes in the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall and every mile he bikes in a trek across California planned for this fall . With such competition for dollars , some candidates have all but given_up fund-raising . &quot; I ' m not counting_on getting too_much money , &quot; Quidwai said , adding that he ' s prepared to spend up_to $ 15 # 000 from his own pocket . The focus_on money disappoints many candidates -- but they know it ' s vital . With 16 candidates , voters are bound to receive stacks of political mailers . Most likely , they ' ll pull_out the glossiest , slickest brochures to thumb through first . &quot; I would hope voters would be more impressed with the content of the message than the delivery , &quot; Marshall Dixon said . &quot; But we realize a lot of voters may_not want to sift through it all . We ' re all rolling the dice , wondering what we can say to push the hot button. &quot; Like political hopefuls nationwide , Thousand Oaks candidates have settled_on two hot buttons : crime and jobs . Firefighter Fox and Police Detective Michael Markey hope to capitalize on widespread concern about crime by emphasizing their years of dedication to public safety . &quot; The fact that I ' m a firefighter seems to be very important to people because I ' ve already earned the public_trust , &quot; Fox said . Markey agreed : &quot; I ' m already a public_servant . I ' m not a politician. &quot; In his platform , Markey suggests expanding intervention programs for at-risk youths , including trying to scare them into straight living by giving them tours of jail_cells . Fox calls_for setting_up senior_citizen patrols , enlisting reserve officers to help overworked sheriff ' s deputies and establishing a public safety committee to evaluate the city ' s needs . Other candidates also have proposed measures to keep Thousand Oaks safe . Lance Winslow has already set_up a mobile crime watch , enlisting business people who drive_around the city to report suspicious activity . Jeannette Scovill hopes to hold workshops to teach residents crime prevention tips . And Michael Friedman would donate his $ 9 # 180-a-year council salary to a special public safety fund . As for the economy , Bill Williams would like to lure large , non-polluting companies to Thousand Oaks by offering financial incentives . And David Hare would seek to streamline government by giving bonuses to city employees who propose cost-saving strategies . Although most candidates have concentrated_on crime , jobs and growth issues , a_few have tried to distinguish themselves with offbeat proposals . Chuck Morsa , for example , would like to set_up a tent city for homeless people on Fireworks Hill in the center of town . And M . Ali Issari would draft a Residents ' Bill of Rights , in which politicians would pledge to uphold the quality_of_life in Thousand Oaks . &quot; I want a document that protects residents ' rights and developers ' rights and establishes the city ' s responsibility to protect our neighborhoods , our environment and our lifestyle , &quot; Issari said . Just how to go_about protecting the Thousand Oaks lifestyle could become a topic of bitter debate , depending_on the makeup of the next council . Led by Zeanah , the slow-growth faction aims to stop most development , especially dense affordable-housing projects and large shopping_centers . They want Thousand Oaks to stay as it is , and they ' re desperate to preserve the city ' s &quot; semirural &quot; atmosphere . The pro-development forces , however , argue that the city cannot stand_still without suffering economically . Orderly development will bring_in the revenue needed to maintain city services , they say . Without some growth , they argue , the city will have to cut_back on everything from library services to police protection . With three seats up for grabs , the upcoming election will turn_into a showdown between these two powerful factions . Already , the mudslinging has started . &quot; This is a very crucial election , &quot; Chamber President Rubenstein said . &quot; There are emotional people ( running_for election ) , fanatics , people who want nothing in their back yards . But I think the good honest people in this community . . . will come_forward and overpower the fanatics. &quot; Those slow-growth &quot; fanatics , &quot; naturally , take quite the opposite view . &quot; There are hundreds of livid Newbury Park residents who are going_to work very hard , &quot; activist Michelle Koetke said . &quot; It ' s time we had a council that listens to the residents , a council that wasn ' t owned and controlled by the same interests that have run this city for years -- the big-money interests. &quot; Talk_about ousting the political Establishment alarms Mayor Fiore , who himself has been a fixture of city government for three decades . &quot; The key issue in this election , &quot; he said &quot; is the retention or loss of our excellent staff , &quot; including the city_manager , city attorney , city clerk and department_heads . &quot; I ' m afraid if the wrong mix gets_on ( the council ) we might lose all_of them. &quot; Eager to keep the council majority in_hands he considers stable , Fiore has strongly endorsed Lazar and has praised a handful of like-minded candidates , including Cole , Dixon , Fox and Laxdal . But the slow-growth advocates have put forth their own unofficial slate : Hare , Issari and Zeanah . And they ' re just as determined to win . &quot; What you ' re seeing are the battle_lines in this town , &quot; Koetke said . &quot; It ' s war. &quot; Thousand Oaks City_Council Sixteen candidates , including two incumbents , are running_for three council seats . The race pits slow-growth candidates against those who favor more development . Concern about rising crime and gang activity will also be among the key issues .
