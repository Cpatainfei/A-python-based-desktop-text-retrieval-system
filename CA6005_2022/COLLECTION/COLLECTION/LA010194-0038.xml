   <TEXT> Like so many of Central_America ' s down and out , Leticia saved money , hitched rides and finagled her way from a home_in El_Salvador , across international borders and toward the certain opportunities of the United States . And like so many , Leticia was stopped , caught by Mexican immigration agents and bused back to this squalid and bustling town on Guatemala ' s northwestern edge . Now the 28-year-old mother of two works as a prostitute to make enough money to try the journey again . She does not tell relatives awaiting her in Los Angeles , or her husband in Canada , the true nature of her current job . &quot; Imagine , driven to this , just to be able to go north again , &quot; she said , seated in front of one of the dozens of brothels that operate round-the-clock here . &quot; You do_it out of necessity. &quot; Leticia is among tens of thousands of Salvadorans , Hondurans and Nicaraguans who have been stranded on the way north , not along the Rio Grande but further south , along Guatemala ' s Rio Suchiate . Guatemala has long been the trampoline for Central_Americans -- and others from as far away as China and India -- positioning themselves to cross Mexico and enter the United States illegally . But as Mexican authorities crack_down on illegal immigration across their southern border , thousands of would-be immigrants are being caught and deported back to Guatemalan frontier towns like Tecun Uman . Guatemalans and others are starting to speak_of a new border , where the line that divides Guatemala and Mexico now represents what the line between Mexico and the United States has for decades -- the gateway for the daring and lucky , the ultimate barrier for the frustrated . &quot; The border has moved south . It is no longer between Mexico and the United States but between Guatemala and Mexico , &quot; said Raul Hernandez , who handles refugee and related issues for the Roman_Catholic_Church ' s Episcopal Conference in Guatemala . &quot; For the large majority of people trying to go_to the United States , the biggest obstacle they now face is here. &quot; Especially as the North_American Free_Trade Agreement relaxes barriers and transforms this continent into a more unified , single bloc , Mexico ' s border to Central_America is expected to become the rear guard in the U.S.-backed fight against illegal immigration . Reflecting the enhanced role Guatemala may soon have in stopping illegal immigration , a team from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service spent a month this fall training Guatemalan police and immigration agents . Although brief training courses have been offered previously , this was the first extensive program . Guatemalan towns like Tecun Uman are feeling the brunt of the increased number of deportations , which church officials say could be as_many as 500 a day . Tecun Uman is an anarchic spot where life is as hard as it is cheap , where abandoned children sleep_in the streets and furtive men and women cower in flophouses , waiting for contact from a smuggler . The desperation of stranded immigrants forces many into crime or other seedy forms of survival . It ' s big business for those who traffic in human contraband . But it frightens and worries the longtime residents . In the last decade , the permanent population of Tecun Uman has doubled ; it more_than doubles again if one counts the transient or &quot; floating &quot; population . Permanent residents are now outnumbered by floaters . Named for a Mayan warrior who was ultimately slain by a Spanish conquistador , Tecun Uman had one brothel 15 years ago ; today , residents estimate , it has 35 , plus dozens more striptease bars and 24-hour honky-tonks . There is one church and no hospital . &quot; Tecun Uman has been converted into a hell , where everything you can imagine is permitted , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; There is prostitution , alcoholism , drug_addiction , money_laundering . . . . &quot; The arrival of so many rootless people has had a destabilizing effect on Tecun Uman , says the city ' s lone Catholic priest , Father Jesus Rodriguez . &quot; It is a population that is illegal , undocumented , foreign . . . without a sense of community identity , &quot; said Rodriguez , a Spaniard who has ministered to Tecun Uman and the surrounding villages for about 15 years . &quot; Each day there is a loss of community relationship . There is no love for the town or the community , no joining together to defend the town ' s interests. &quot; Rodriguez frets that the people of Tecun Uman are sinking_in a mire of spiritual disintegration . Few people , he says , are willing to take &quot; honest work &quot; in factories or farms ; they prefer the quick cash from illicit businesses spawned by illegal immigration , from the running of cheap boardinghouses to thriving coyote ( immigrant smuggling ) operations . Buses spewing noxious black smoke rumble in and out of Tecun Uman constantly , snaking through the maze of dusty crowded streets and vying for space with hundreds of rickshaw-like taxis that pass_by in swarms . The buses bring people who will wait for their chance to head north , usually by crossing the narrow , shallow stretch of the Rio Suchiate that skirts Tecun Uman . Guatemala attracts would-be illegal immigrants for several reasons . First and most obvious , its location makes_it a natural jumping-off_point . Second , most Central_Americans do not need visas to enter Guatemala , a privilege made_possible by a new spirit of regional integration . And , according to many who make the trip , Guatemalan authorities are willing to look the other way , or are easy to bribe . Just outside Tecun Uman , customers are ferried across the Rio Suchiate on inner_tubes strapped together under planks . The makeshift rafts glide back and forth in open view of anyone who cares to notice but are never impeded by authorities , according to the men who pilot them . A one-way trip costs about 35 cents . Once in Mexico , Central_Americans are often ripped_off and abandoned by their illegal guides or coyotes . They are preyed upon by roving bands of robbers and rapists , shaken down by corrupt Mexican cops and ultimately caught by immigration agents and thrown_out . The undocumented are routinely deported to the nearest country -- Guatemala -- regardless of their nationality . &quot; The deportees come_in busloads , and we do not have the means to handle them , &quot; said Eduardo Paz , a Guatemalan immigration official in Tecun Uman . &quot; Most of them don ' t have any money , so they stay in Tecun . Most of the Guatemalans find their way home , but the Salvadorans , the Hondurans , the Nicaraguans , they all stay here. &quot; Interviews with more_than a dozen people in Tecun Uman reflected a widely held perception that Mexican immigration authorities have made_it even tougher for Central_Americans to cross in just the last few months . Indeed , 1993 was a record year for deportations from Mexico , according to the Mexican government . About 130 # 000 people , the vast majority Central_Americans , were ejected , Secretary of Government Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido said . Gonzalez denied that Mexico is cracking_down specifically on Central_Americans . But there has been a shift in government attitudes , with officials becoming increasingly vocal in recent months on the need to stop illegal entries into Mexico . While attacking U.S. policies and practices that keep undocumented Mexicans out of the United States , the Mexican government has in turn become less tolerant of illegal Central_Americans , most of whom are regarded_as economic refugees now that the wars in Nicaragua and El_Salvador have formally ended . &quot; Mexico will attempt to stop whatever migratory flow that is_on the margin of the law , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; Now we are complying with the law ; before it was something that was enforced &quot; with discretion . Many Guatemalans believe the Mexicans are acting at the behest of the U.S._government , while U.S. immigration officials say the Mexican government is acting to protect its own economic interests . Central_Americans who cross into Mexico or the United States represent competition with Mexican workers for jobs . The economic development that NAFTA is supposed to spawn in Mexico makes_it increasingly attractive to Central_Americans , these officials say . &quot; Mexico has more to lose now , &quot; said an official familiar_with immigration issues . &quot; Twenty years ago , Central_Americans did not perceive El Norte as Mexico . The U.S. was El Norte . With NAFTA , that could change . El Norte becomes closer. &quot; While denying it would ever serve as an arm of U.S. immigration policy , the Mexican government for several years quietly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the U.S._government to assist in deportation of illegal immigrants , most of whom were Central_Americans . Gonzalez said he ended use of the special U.S. fund when he took_office a year ago . And so , regardless of who pays_for it , deportees like Leticia , the prostitute , end_up back here in Tecun Uman . Lounging in wooden slat chairs on the front_porch of the &quot; The Babes &quot; brothel , Leticia and two Honduran women dressed in pink spandex insisted their work was temporary , something to do for quick cash before moving_on . Leticia figures she can earn $ 35 to $ 70 a week . &quot; I cried on the border when they caught me , &quot; said Leticia , who has tried to reach California several times in the last year . &quot; I support my kids , my mother , I ' m all alone . We all know why we ' re here , the necessity , that ' s the way it is . But I still have my intentions . . . to go_to the United States. &quot; Down the road , outside the Lord of Three Falls Catholic_Church on Tecun Uman ' s central plaza , three young children slept_in a doorway . They left Honduras four months ago but were stopped in Mexico and deported . &quot; I ' m trying to get_back to Honduras , &quot; said one of the children , a 13-year-old boy with matted hair and raspy voice , &quot; but I don ' t have the bus fare. &quot; Fernando Guillen , a Salvadoran who says he lived_in the United States for 15 years before being caught during a trip in Mexico and deported , was hanging_out in the plaza , about to give_up on what he said was an increasingly difficult trip north . &quot; A lot of stuff happens , &quot; Guillen said in street-toughened English . &quot; People get robbed , people get killed . Two women with me ( in Mexico ) , they were taken and got raped ( by a gang of bandits ) . &quot; The Mexican authorities , he said , &quot; detain you for three days and they don ' t give you no food , not even tortillas and frijoles , man , they don ' t give you nothing . The hardest part is getting from here to Mexico_City . To get_into the U.S. then is easy. &quot; Guillen , who said he has a wife and U.S.-born daughter in Santa Monica , said he has been trying to return to California since April . &quot; But I ' m getting tired , spending_money and spending_money , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ll try again after Christmas. &quot; The sympathy that many longtime Guatemalan residents may have had for the deportees has been eroded by what they see as the deterioration of their town and lives . The few remaining families worry about their children ' s safety . Merchants complain of having to sweep their sidewalks constantly to clear trash left by the homeless immigrants and of having to fend_off beggars . &quot; The townspeople are very resentful , &quot; said resident Maria Lilian Perez , 33 , a mother of six . &quot; Every time something bad happens , they say , ' Oh , it ' s the Hondurans , ' or ' It ' s the Salvadorans. ' Many of the people who stay here don ' t want to work honorably . They make_it bad for everybody . The trip used to be better for them , but lately many have been failing , and they stay here , waiting in limbo. &quot; Rafael Bamaca , who runs a boardinghouse , agreed . &quot; They talk_about having no money , then they sell their belongings , mortgage their house and pay a coyote $ 2 # 000 , $ 3 # 000 to take them north , &quot; he said , shaking his head . &quot; Then they get cheated , ripped_off and end_up back here -- with nothing . &quot; It makes me sad , but it also makes me angry . The women prostitute themselves , the men steal . . . . They talk_about better futures , but what kind of future is this ? &quot; Times staff writer Patrick J . McDonnell in Mexico_City contributed to this report .</TEXT>
