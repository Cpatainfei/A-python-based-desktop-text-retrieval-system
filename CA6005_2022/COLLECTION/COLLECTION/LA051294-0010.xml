   <TEXT> In response to Cardinal Roger Mahony ' s criticism of the Kevorkian decision ( May 3 ) and his apotheosis of human suffering ( &quot; Ending Pain Shouldn ' t Mean Ending Lives , &quot; Commentary , May 9 ) : What has he to say to kin of the terminally ill who choose to &quot; play God &quot; by pulling the plug or being assisted in doing so ? Is there &quot; dignity &quot; in living under what Mahony calls &quot; effective pain control &quot; when loved ones are comatose or begging to die and will never again be able to relate to themselves or their surroundings ? My mother hung_on for two years under &quot; effective pain control. &quot; There was no hope for her recovery and she was miserable , as was I for her.We did the correct thing and waited for the end . Today I think dignity is served by Dr. Jack Kevorkian ' s option to die and President Nixon ' s instructions not to use extraordinary means . If I become terminally ill and useless to myself and to others , I don ' t want to be forcibly sustained by theology or technology . DENTON PORTER Long_Beach * Regarding Conrad ' s cartoon depicting Michelangelo ' s fresco of the creation that shows &quot; God &quot; ( presumably Dr. Jack Kevorkian ) extending a mask on a tube to Adam ( Drawingboard , May 4 ) : Is Conrad disturbed that man usurps God ' s power by extending a mask on a tube for life support oxygen , thereby not allowing life to naturally cease ? Or is he just more disturbed that suffering terminally ill patients could have their prayers answered and be relieved of their intractable misery ? CARL P . SIEGMAN Santa Monica</TEXT>
