   <HEADLINE> DECIDE NOW HOW YOU DON ' T WANT TO DIE ; MEDICINE : BY SIGNING AN ' ADVANCE DIRECTIVE , ' MR . NIXON AND MRS . ONASSIS SPARED THEIR FAMILIES INCALCULABLE HEARTACHE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis may have agreed on little during their lives , but in dying they chose a similar route , setting an important example : They anticipated death and chose to meet it without aggressive medical_care . The former President suffered a massive stroke , a disease quite different from the former First_Lady ' s aggressive tumor of the lymph_nodes . Mr. Nixon ' s illness came_on suddenly , while Mrs . Onassis had received treatment for several months . The key to the decision made by each of these individuals was to consider in_advance how they wanted to spend their last_days . Each completed an &quot; advance directive , &quot; a document that states an individual ' s wishes regarding medical_care , should he or she be unable to participate when decisions have to be made . Because of this advance planning , family and physicians knew that Mr. Nixon and Mrs . Onassis desired a focus_on quality , not quantity , of life when the prognosis became bleak . The resultant medical_care allowed death to come_in a &quot; dignified &quot; way . Making advance decisions about medical_care is difficult for Americans . It means explicitly considering prognosis , the risks and benefits of treatment and the effects of illness and treatment on quality_of_life . What ' s perhaps most difficult is that such decisions require a recognition of the limits of modern medicine , a concept blurred if not buried in the nearly constant reports of new cures , scientific breakthroughs and unique , remarkable cases . Making future medical decisions may mean coming_to terms with data on how likely a treatment is to fail without necessarily &quot; giving_up hope. &quot; Such decisions may also mean letting_go_of the expectation for a miracle . These decisions are difficult because death is often the only alternative to aggressive care . Mr. Nixon could have been placed on a mechanical ventilator to breathe for him , perhaps extending his life substantially and permitting some neurologic recovery . It is not possible to exclude the slim chance of full recovery to his prior state of health , although the probability of such an outcome is so low that it would have to be regarded_as miraculous . But the downside also must be considered : the days or weeks or months spent uncomfortably in the intensive-care unit , the much greater likelihood that any recovery would be to a severely impaired state and the probability of future suffering . Mrs . Onassis could have chosen from even more available options . While dying from a tumor that would not respond to therapy , she developed a pneumonia ; she had a treatable illness in the setting of a rapidly terminal disease . The physicians could have treated , and perhaps cured , the pneumonia , only to have Mrs . Onassis die of the tumor . If she lived long enough after surviving the pneumonia , Mrs . Onassis could have searched for another therapy for her tumor . There is always another , though less likely to be successful , treatment option . And if not , there ' s probably an experimental protocol . For some people , the &quot; last_resort , &quot; is the option preferred . But patients and families making decisions at the brink of life must recognize that these are exceedingly likely to be unsuccessful and result in a death in the hospital . Mrs . Onassis chose to die at_home , in familiar surroundings , encircled by family . This is not to say that , given similar clinical circumstances , all patients would or should choose a similar course , although surveys of Americans about end-of-life preferences suggest that many , if not most , would have made similar choices . However , without advance discussions , the families and physicians of such individuals would not know these patients ' preferences . As a result , these individuals would have ended_up in intensive-care units on mechanical ventilators , most dying there days or weeks later . Many patients whose preferences are not known will die while receiving aggressive care . Vast medical resources are expended in the process of these deaths . In part due_to aggressive care at the end of life , the United States invests about 1 % of the gross_national_product in intensive care , far more_than any other nation . This is not to say that we should not employ intensive care , utilize modern technology and marvel at medical breakthroughs -- only that such advances must be used in_order to reach the patient ' s goals , not necessarily just to prolong life . In the context of usual medical_care , the end-of-life decisions of Mr. Nixon and Mrs . Onassis were special . May we learn from their example and examine our values , scrutinize our medical_care and discuss and complete advance directives for future care .</TEXT>
