   <HEADLINE> SUMMIT ' S FAMILY-PLANNING STRATEGIES WORRY MUSLIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a dingy suite of offices above the human shouting , bird warbling and airborne feathers of a crowded poultry market , Essam Eryan , a physician and leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood , sits below a poster of an Earth ensnared by a giant octopus named the United States . He has to raise his voice slightly to make himself heard . &quot; What is wrong with big families ? My own opinion is : A big family is much better than a small family . It gives a very good chance to bring_up children well , to give them a good education in traditions , to reduce selfishness , &quot; Eryan says . &quot; All the family-planning policy here in Egypt is planned and financed by the Americans , &quot; he goes_on . &quot; The responsible way to stop the population problem is to make development and create jobs . So we can welcome the newcomers , not kill them. &quot; Egypt has about 60 million people and counts 1 million more every year . About 96 % of its population is crammed onto the small sliver of green valley that straddles the River Nile . Poor families are stuffed into tenements that rise , bleak and sand-colored , toward a sky fouled by factory and auto emissions . Walking down a Cairo sidewalk is like pushing yourself through a human sieve . Yet here , where the International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo ' s new conference_center will try to set a global population strategy next month , a wave of Islamic resistance is mounting on issues of abortion , family relations and sex education that are likely to form some of the cornerstones of the new policy . Muslim militants around the world are rallying to defeat such a program . They believe it is aimed at stemming the birth of new Muslims while leaving them impoverished , underdeveloped and unprepared to stand as equals in what many see as an impending contest of civilizations between East and West . &quot; They see the growth of Muslims as a threat to their own interests , &quot; said Fehmi Huweidi , a prominent writer on Islamic affairs in Cairo . Even the restrained clerics of orthodox Islam have raised a voice of protest , arguing that many of the conference ' s frames_of_reference on family lifestyles , women ' s inheritance rights and abortion run counter to the teachings of the Koran . The debate has heated to a fever pitch_in Egypt as the conference approaches . Cairo ' s biweekly Al Shaab , the voice of the Labor_Party and the Muslim Brotherhood , published a banner headline this week that read : &quot; The Crimes of the Population Conference . . . For the Genocide of Muslims and Oppressed Peoples. &quot; Venerable Al Azhar University , the seat of religious scholarship for the Muslim world , weighed in with a strongly worded condemnation of language in the conference ' s draft action program , which it said conflicts with Islamic teachings on abortion , homosexuality and traditional family values . &quot; The ambiguous expressions , abstract terms and innovative jargon that abound_in it suggest that it aims to adopt the opposite of the basic precepts which Islam has laid_down , &quot; Al Azhar complained . &quot; It aims to defend sexual_relations which arise between members of the same sex or between different sexes outside legal marriage , which destroys the values to which all revealed religions aspire. &quot; The debate has created unlikely bedfellows as some of the most prestigious Islamic organizations in the world -- the Muslim World League , the Organization of Islamic Conference and the Muslim World Congress -- have joined forces with the Vatican to fight for significant changes in the draft action program . It will come_up for debate at the conference , which opens Sept . 5 , when 20 # 000 delegates from 191 nations around the world will gather here under the sponsorship of the United Nations . Islam ' s response to the global population crisis will be crucial to any success in curbing human growth . Muslims now make_up about 20 % of the world ' s population , and birthrates , elevated in all Third_World countries , are highest in Muslim nations . Islamic birthrates average 2.8 % , a figure 22 % higher than in most developing nations and many times higher than the overall rate in the developed world . Yet some Islamic countries , such_as Egypt , have been among the forerunners in curbing population growth in recent years . Family-planning clinics , funded in part_with large grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development , make birth_control and reproductive health information available throughout Cairo and in villages in the farthest reaches of rural Egypt . In 1992 about 47 % of all Egyptian women surveyed -- in a country where 30 % of the women are illiterate -- were using birth_control as part of a national program that had reduced the overall fertility_rate from more_than five births per woman in 1980 to 3.9 births . Other Islamic nations , including Jordan , Bangladesh , Tunisia , Pakistan and Morocco , lead the world in promoting family_planning . Iran ' s Islamic fundamentalist government is operating one of the most successful family-planning programs in the world after seeing its population growth_rate ( adjusted from the fertility_rate above by factoring in deaths ) reach a high of 3.9 % in 1985 . Now , that has shrunk to less than 2.7 % due_to a campaign that includes television advertising , sermons , family-planning clinics and free vasectomies and tubal_ligation for those who want them . In both Iran and Egypt , abortion is illegal under Islamic law except to save the life of the mother but is widely and quietly available on the faintest of pretexts . In Egypt , for example , a physician need only certify that terminating a pregnancy was necessary for the mental_health of the mother . Islamic scholars around the world have stood largely united against abortion except to save the mother ' s life . Egypt ' s grand mufti , the government ' s chief cleric , opposed Al Azhar this week and issued a ruling saying abortion might be sanctioned when a pregnancy is caused by rape , incest or , sometimes , in the case of an unwanted pregnancy when a couple has been using contraceptives but is unable to support a child . &quot; However , the woman should seek abortion the moment she knows she is pregnant , &quot; said the mufti , Sheik Mohammed Sayed Tantawi . Unlike the Catholic_Church , which is campaigning against the twin issues of abortion and family_planning , Islam has a history of tolerance for birth_control , though it doesn ' t encourage it . Al Azhar has issued five fatwas , or religious rulings , sanctioning birth_control since 1937 , although permanent sterilization is forbidden except to protect a mother ' s life or health . Al Azhar itself operates four family-planning clinics in Egypt , although the Muslim Brotherhood and nearly all other Islamic charity organizations have shied from any endorsement of birth_control . In statements opposing the conference , Muslim organizations have returned repeatedly to issues of_values of terminology , objecting particularly to language urging that teen-agers be educated about sex and AIDS and have access to sexual health_care with assurances of confidentiality , plus references_to &quot; marriage and other unions &quot; and to &quot; sexually active unmarried individuals. &quot; &quot; We have seen the results of the West ' s sexual revolution and do not want them repeated in the Muslim world , &quot; the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement on the upcoming conference . &quot; What we are concerned about is a program that would have agencies , controlled and funded by those of Christian / European heritage , seek to limit the number of ' brown ' babies through imposition of Western concepts of family_planning , &quot; the council said . &quot; Abortion and permanent contraception are seen by Muslims as an attempt to mitigate the effects of a promiscuous lifestyle. &quot; U.N. officials and others say the proposed program of action seeks not to encourage abortion but to prevent the health hazards of illegal abortion by preventing unwanted pregnancies to begin with . &quot; As a Muslim physician , I wish to assert that the United Nations organization respects the values and traditions of all countries , &quot; said Nafis Sadek , executive_director of the U.N. Fund for Population Activities and secretary_general of the upcoming conference . Maher Mahran , Egypt ' s minister of state for population and coordinator for the conference in Egypt , said Al Azhar ' s statement of opposition was based in part on a misreading of the document , with a faulty translation that in Arabic made_it appear that sex education is pornography . &quot; When we mention sex it gives the impression that we are going_to educate boys and girls in the techniques of enjoying sex , &quot; he said . Mahran said Egypt will continue to insist on principles upon which the Koran speaks unequivocally , including any endorsement of homosexuality , which he said is &quot; non-negotiable. &quot; But Mahran has become the object of scorn in the militant Islamic community in Egypt , which believes the Egyptian government is hosting the international conference and endorsing its principles as a way of currying favor with the West and excusing its own failure to promote successful economic development . In their view , the upcoming debate must be framed_in political and economic terms , not merely scriptural . &quot; In the Arab world from a regional point_of_view , you will realize they don ' t have any population problem , &quot; said writer Huweidi , noting that the wealthy Arab Gulf nations have been struggling to boost their populations to discourage reliance on foreign labor . Egypt , he said , has seen its economic_growth rate decline from 7 % to less than 1.5 % in recent years and has tried to blame the resulting problems on population growth , whose major increase has been attributable to a decrease in deaths from disease . &quot; When we see the problem , we realize the main issue is how to help develop society before imposing family_planning on the society , &quot; Huweidi said . &quot; But the government has kept blaming the people , saying you are responsible_for your poverty because you had too many children. &quot; The persistent view heard in Islamic circles is that the West is seeking to curb population growth in the undeveloped world in_order to dominate it . &quot; They pretend that their invitation to stop the growth of populations in Asia , Africa and Latin_America is_due to their fear of poverty spreading in those areas . . . when they were the ones that stole our wealth and forced economic retardation on us , &quot; said Adel Hussein , editor of As Shaab . &quot; As they killed us in the past with bombs and bullets in_order to rule and control us , they now want to kill us and our unborn children for the same purpose. &quot; Eryan of the Muslim Brotherhood said Muslims will seek a postponement of any decision on population policy until Muslim issues have a chance to be fully aired and debated .</TEXT>
