   <HEADLINE> ALL ABOUT EVE ; THE BIBLE AS SOURCE OF WOMEN ' S OPPRESSION AS WELL AS LIBERATION , HUMOR AS WELL AS INSPIRATION ; OUT OF THE GARDEN : WOMEN WRITERS ON THE BIBLE , EDITED BY CHRISTINA BUCHMANN AND CELINA SPIEGEL ( FAWCETT COLUMBINE : $ 23 ; 352 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; What does_it mean to read the Bible as a contemporary woman ? &quot; The question , put to 28 Jewish and Christian women writers , has borne fruit in a sparkling collection of literary essays on the Bible , the first ever to be written exclusively by women . Focusing_on the Hebrew Bible ( Tanach for Jewish readers , Old_Testament for Christians ) , the book ' s approach is moderately feminist and resolutely anti-dogmatic ; co-editors Christina Buchmann and Celina Spiegel confess that &quot; it is only recently that many of us have come_to find the Bible interesting , no longer experiencing its claims to authority as so overwhelming as_to demand mere assent and respectful attention. &quot; The Bible is more_than just interesting , however , for the 28 contributors to this book , among whom are such distinguished writers as Cynthia Ozick , Louise Erdrich and Ursula Le Guin . These women writers find the Bible , if not overwhelming in its authority , thoroughly captivating in its appeal_to our imagination and our moral_sense . So it should be . Throughout the centuries , women in predominantly Jewish and Christian societies have found themselves in the Bible as in no other book -- it has been the chief literary vehicle not only for their subordination to men but also for their self-discovery and flourishing as women . It is impossible to overestimate the influence of the Bible on our cultural heritage and our multiple identities . Women or men , we must come_to terms with the Bible , if we wish to understand ourselves . For many of us , this requires a work of critical reclamation , beyond simply brushing the cobwebs off the old book . This work of reclamation is attempted by the present volume . Though not comprehensive , it succeeds brilliantly in representing the full spectrum of feminist and feminine ways to read the Bible . The sense of outrage at injustices done to women in the name of the Bible is softened -- without being silenced -- by the presence of voices that remain loyal to biblical traditions . In contrast to many recent works of feminist theology , &quot; Out of the Garden &quot; is not sicklied over by resentment at male privilege ; as a result , it exudes confidence and respect for women ' s experiences . Eve , it is often said , has gotten a bad rap . Created as an afterthought , she found herself blamed for all_the afflictions that followed upon the first couple ' s exile from the Garden . Yet Barbara Grizzuti Harrison points_out that it was Eve ' s disobedience ( her &quot; happy fault , &quot; as the Christian_liturgy for the Easter Vigil puts it ) that gave us our world , and implanted in us the restless yearning for heaven from which all creativity flows . Lot ' s wife has been similarly maligned . For her vain , typically female , curiosity she was turned_into a pillar of salt . Rebecca Goldstein takes a second look , drawing upon Talmudic midrashim lovingly collected for her by her own father , to create a portrait of Lot ' s wife as a figure of maternal solicitude , willing to share the plight of the daughters she had left_behind . The Rabbinic tradition of midrashic storytelling is happily exploited by several entries , occasionally with humorous results . Norma Rosen , who understands midrash as &quot; unbridled and unintimidated imagination , &quot; offers an example worthy of Harlequin Romances , in her midrash on Rebekah . The young bride discovers that she has married into a dysfunctional family . Husband Isaac is impotent because of a post-traumatic stress disorder that dates_back to the time when he was nearly sacrificed by his theopathic father ; he suffers recurrent nightmares of Abraham coming_after him with a knife . Desperate to overcome the curse of barrenness , Rebekah arranges for a tryst with &quot; brawny Ishmael. &quot; Just in time , Isaac recovers his manhood , and Rebekah finally gets_to be the mother of Jacob ( Israel ) and Esau ( who is brawny like Ishmael ) . Yet perhaps these gothic palpitations are not so far off the mark ; the Bible is_full of stories of sexual intrigue , murderous sibling rivalry , and sudden reversals of fortune . How odd , that the designs of Providence should so often be advanced by scheming subterfuge and trickster-like hoax . Jacob deceives his father in_order to steal the inheritance from firstborn son Esau ; in turn , Jacob ' s father-in-law tricks the young upstart into taking his firstborn daughter Leah as the unwanted prize for seven years ' toil . From such strange twists and turns of fortune , Israel ' s destiny is forged . As usual , several authors point_out , it is the male hero whose metamorphoses are of chief concern to biblical authors ; female characters -- even strong ones such_as Rebekah , Rachel , Hannah and Esther -- serve primarily as the foil for their men . Comparative_literature scholar Ilana Pardes notes , &quot; With the exception of Eve , we have no scene that depicts the birth of the heroine , let alone rebirth . The biblical woman appears on stage only when she is marriageable , and her stay there is determined , generally speaking , by the impact of her maternal position on the status of her ( favorite ) son. &quot; Nonetheless , the prophetic tradition keeps these biblical women before our eyes as witnesses for all who are dispossessed . Rachel weeps for her children , as long as any children need to be wept for . As Pardes puts it , &quot; In Jeremiah ' s famous prophecy Rachel is allowed to transcend time . Her voice rises from the dead to cry on behalf of the exiled. &quot; The volume offers several examples of feminist didactic preaching , exegesis and allegory , of uneven quality . Biblical scholar Phyllis Trible skillfully retells the Elijah and Jezebel story from a Phoenician ' s perspective , to show that these two fiery prophets of competing Gods are mirror_images of each other . Indeed , they need each other . Poet Alicia Ostriker ' s entry , &quot; The Nursing Father , &quot; drawn from her longer work &quot; The Nakedness of the Fathers , &quot; blends midrash with personal confession in_order to discover in the Exodus narrative a mythic charter for women ' s emancipation ; this would make wonderful material for a Passover celebration . For Patricia Williams , the book of Exodus mirrors her experience as a single , black , 40-plus adoptive mother ; out of this experience , illuminated by the Bible , comes her moving plea for a communal moral awakening that would make abortion not illegal but unnecessary . June Jordan finds in the story of Ruth and Naomi a precedent for the community of women friends who supported her through her ordeal with breast_cancer . Several essays champion the cause of neglected anti-heroines , like Vashti in the book of Esther or Hagar in Genesis . British novelist Fay Weldon makes the story of Samson and Delilah the occasion for the one vulgar essay in the book -- a wildly exaggerated diatribe against the Bible , Christianity and , in passing , Islam , all_of which she construes as viciously and systematically anti-woman . To balance the record , in the book ' s best essay , Cynthia Ozick characterizes the religion of ancient Israel as the matrix for the idea of &quot; personhood &quot; on which feminism itself depends . The feminist spirituality movement overlooks this , in its eagerness to celebrate the memory of archaic goddess-centered traditions in which , it is imagined , women flourished . Yet , as Ozick points_out , it was ancient Judaism -- with its astonishing teaching that human_beings are created in the divine image and likeness -- that first gave women a basis for claiming the freedom and dignity that feminism rightfully demands for them . The story of Hannah illustrates this : she offers her own prayers in Temple , thus marking the radical shift from religion centered_on the public sacrificial cult to religion centered_on more intimate ways of relating to God ; moreover , her husband encourages her to believe_in her own worth , rather than despair because of barrenness . Is this principle of a woman ' s intrinsic worth before God any less valid because a man voices it ? Ozick , a &quot; classical &quot; feminist , calls_for Jewish feminists to feed their moral imagination on the sacral humanism of the Torah , rather than the ideological humanisms ( many of them virulently anti-Semitic ) of the Enlightenment . Similarly , Kathleen Norris finds in the Benedictine tradition of living out of the Psalms , abundant resources for the genuine fulfillment of women ; and Louise Erdrich discerns a delicate yet resilient filament of hope in the resigned wisdom of Ecclesiastes . These are essays of considerable literary erudition and sophistication that re-conceive what it means to read the Bible as a woman , either by using feminist categories in uncommon ways or , in a_few cases , by not using them at all . Novelist Deidre Levinson is much too interested by Saul , the scapegoat-king , to strain for feminist lessons . Elizabeth Swados restages the book of Job as a musical clown show ; Job ' s wife gets_to hit him over the head with a bowling_pin , but otherwise her role is not significantly enhanced . The effect of including such essays alongside others explicitly feminist is refreshingly de-ghettoizing . The anthology closes with an impish allegory by Ursula Le Guin , in which Eve gets_to unname the animals . If this is Eve ' s proper task , then &quot; Out of the Garden &quot; performs it well , dislodging dull stereotypes to enable both women and men readers to see the Bible with fresh eyes .</TEXT>
