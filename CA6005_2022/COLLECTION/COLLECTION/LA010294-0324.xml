   <HEADLINE> ' 93 / ' 94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK ; STATE MAY FINALLY SEE A RECOVERY ; BUT L.A. AND ORANGE COUNTIES COULD STILL LAG , ECONOMISTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s prolonged recession might actually end in 1994 -- not that most residents of the Golden State would notice . Most economists predict that economic output and employment levels will bottom_out midyear , with barely perceptible growth occurring in the second_half . So even if it comes , a recovery won ' t do much to get the beleaguered state back on track . &quot; I think 1994 will be the transition year , &quot; said Adrian Sanchez , regional economist with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles . &quot; But we ' re laying most of our eggs in ' 95 ' s basket , where we will see the visible signs of recovery through most of the state. &quot; The most recent quarterly prediction by the widely watched UCLA Business Forecasting Project argued that the state will never regain the bulk of the high-paying defense , manufacturing and other jobs lost since 1990 . California is already 2 million jobs below previous trends , the UCLA forecasters said . And most new jobs will be added in the lower-paying service sector , especially retail trade . UCLA forecasts a 0.2 % dip in non-farm employment in 1994 , then 1.3 % growth in 1995 . But it won ' t be until 1998 that the state regains real strength , with 3 % annual job growth , the forecasters say . Leading the recovery will be the Inland Empire and central parts of the state , followed by the Bay Area and Northern California , with the rest of the Southland bringing_up the rear . What about Los Angeles County , home to most of the state ' s defense industry ? Most economists don ' t expect a turnaround here until 1995 at the earliest . Most economists say it is construction that will lead the state out of its long malaise . Once housing prices stabilize and potential buyers regain their confidence in the economy , there should be a spurt in home buying , leading to more construction and jobs . So far , there are conflicting signs_in the real_estate market . New homes sales have been rising , but home prices continue to fall . And new housing starts declined on the West Coast in November . Continuing low interest_rates and home prices will draw more buyers into the market , said Pat Neal , president of the California Assn . of Realtors . &quot; The worst is behind us , &quot; she said . Strong growth can be expected only in certain industries such_as movies and television , business services , health_care and tourism . None of those sectors is significant enough to fuel a robust recovery in California , economists said . &quot; The problem is you just don ' t know what is going_to be the new source of jobs , &quot; said Ronald Schmidt , senior economist at the Federal_Reserve_Bank of San Francisco . &quot; And you can ' t anticipate these things . We didn ' t anticipate the computer boom . Maybe you can look_at biotech , or certainly , in California , at expanding trade opportunities . These are all things that might trigger a real surge of activity. &quot; Key to California ' s recovery will be the resurgence of the U.S. -- and then the European and Japanese -- economies , which buy the state ' s goods and services , said Stephen Levy , an economist and head of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto . Supporters of recent international trade pacts -- the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and the latest accord under the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- argue that California stands to benefit greatly from the relaxation of tariffs and quotas the world round . But other analysts say the benefits of NAFTA will be modest and those from GATT will be long in coming . &quot; We should expect the California economy to lag the nation for one more year , &quot; Levy said . &quot; Even if we do turn_around our growth , we ' ll be less than the rest of the nation because of the drag of defense reductions. &quot; David G . Hensley , vice_president of real_estate research at Salomon Bros . in New York and former head of UCLA ' s Business Forecasting Project , has an unusual take_on the recent data -- one that gives him more hope for the state ' s immediate future . Salomon Bros . recently compared state employment counts with federal ones and found important discrepancies in the totals , suggesting that employment growth in the states may have been undercounted last year , Hensley said . In California ' s case , 1993 employment growth may have been underestimated by as much as 120 # 000 jobs -- meaning the state ' s losses may already have started to level_off . The official state estimate is that California lost about 170 # 000 non-farm jobs in 1993 , Hensley said . Another factor suggesting that things are already starting to look_up , in Hensley ' s view : Retail sales in key urban markets of Northern and Southern California showed strong year-to-year growth , on the order of 6 % to 8 % or better . And the biggest indicator to watch : Announcements of defense layoffs dropped_off in the last six months or so , suggesting that 1994 could see a breather in the rate of defense job losses , though such losses are sure to continue . &quot; That may be enough in itself to allow a technical turn_in the economy to modest rates_of_growth , rather than a decline , &quot; Hensley said . There is one big risk to watch for in 1994 . If tax_revenues continue to fall , state and local_governments may lay off large_numbers of workers -- layoffs that were largely avoided in 1993 . Such layoffs could derail any nascent recovery .</TEXT>
