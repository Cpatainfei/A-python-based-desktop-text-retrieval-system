   <HEADLINE> VA HOSPITALS CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE ROLES IN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Department of Veterans Affairs is surveying all 172 VA hospitals on any role they may have had in post-World War II radiation experiments , some of them possibly involving unwitting patients , Secretary Jesse Brown said Monday . At least 48 VA hospitals had radioisotope laboratories licensed by 1958 , 11 years after the VA established a secret atomic medicine program to augment research into the fledgling field by the Atomic Energy Commission . Annual reports published by the Veterans Administration , which was replaced by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989 , show that 959 radioisotope studies or research projects were carried_out in 1955 and 1956 alone . Brown said he did not know whether any of those experiments or others conducted at VA hospitals between 1947 and 1979 are among the estimated 800 radiation tests on human_beings disclosed last month by Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary . But VA documents indicate that its secret atomic medicine and more public radioisotope programs begun in 1947 were intended to complement research by the AEC , the predecessor to O ' Leary ' s department . After World_War_II , the VA was a pioneer in the use of medical radioisotopes for diagnosing and treating a wide variety of ailments , including dysfunctional thyroid_glands , brain_tumors , leukemia and other cancers .</TEXT>
