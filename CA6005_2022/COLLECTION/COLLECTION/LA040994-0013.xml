   <HEADLINE> TOKYO MUST STICK TO ITS PROMISES ; FACING THE U.S. TRADE ISSUE IS NO LESS CRUCIAL NOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s sudden decision to resign should not be used by Tokyo as an excuse to back_away from his promise to have a package of measures to open Japan ' s markets soon . But the unexpected political turmoil will understandably make_it more difficult to deliver such a plan before July , when the Group of Seven leading industrial countries holds its annual summit . The need to fulfill that promise -- with or without Hosokawa -- is more pressing than ever as the world , not just the United States , watches . Reformist Hosokawa unfortunately fell_short in delivering bombshell changes during his eight months in office , but he did manage to set Japan on a course of change , politically and economically . A slide back to the status_quo could further derail U.S.-Japan efforts to create a new framework for trade . It is unfortunate that Hosokawa could not get_out from under the taint of the money scandals that brought_down three of his predecessors . In his surprise announcement Friday , Hosokawa said he was leaving_office to take responsibility for the controversy surrounding his personal finances , in particular accusations that many years ago he received an illicit $ 952 # 000 payment . The Liberal Democratic Party , which in last July ' s elections lost power after 38 years , was demanding greater disclosure . Hosokawa admitted to no wrongdoing but he acknowledged that &quot; legal problems &quot; had been discovered recently . The LDP , long criticized for its cozy relations with rich supporters and business , suddenly and conveniently became a champion of rooting_out corruption . Interesting that Hosokawa ' s finances posed no problem to the LDP until after he secured passage of political reform , opened the rice market , pushed deregulation and earned praise in Japan for standing_up to recent U.S. trade demands . What happened to Hosokawa had much to do with internal Japanese politics . But should the political turmoil spill_over into stalling Japanese trade initiatives , Japan ' s economic and global interests might suffer . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata are scheduled to meet next week in the highest public contact since U.S.-Japan trade talks fell_through in February . The meeting , if it is held , could take_on more significance because Hata has been discussed as perhaps the leading candidate to succeed Hosokawa . Hosokawa has been an agent of change in a time of real , if unspectacular , political transition . Can Japan continue in that direction ?</TEXT>
