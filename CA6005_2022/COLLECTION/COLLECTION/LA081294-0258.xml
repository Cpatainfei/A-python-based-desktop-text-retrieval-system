   <HEADLINE> EXXON TO PAY $ 287 MILLION TO ALASKA FISHERMEN ; ENVIRONMENT : THE AWARD IN THE FEDERAL CASE , REACHED AFTER 23 DAYS ' DELIBERATION , IS TO COVER ACTUAL LOSSES TO BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exxon Corp . was ordered Thursday to pay $ 287 million in damages to Alaska commercial fishermen who argued that the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill severely hurt their business . The verdict , which awarded less than the $ 895 million sought by the 10 # 000 fishermen who work the waters off southeastern Alaska , came_in the second phase of a massive trial in Anchorage against the nation ' s largest oil_company . A federal jury made the award after a painstaking 23 days of deliberation . The trial , which started May 1 , stemmed from the largest civil suit arising from the accident in Alaska ' s Prince William Sound , where the Exxon tanker wandered from shipping lanes , ran_aground and dumped 11 million gallons of crude_oil . &quot; It is less than we were asking_for , &quot; said Brian O ' Neill , lead trial counsel representing the fishermen . &quot; You wish it would have been closer to $ 895 million , but we ' ll take it anyway. &quot; The award covers compensatory damages , or the actual losses suffered by fishermen , without interest . The fishermen had argued that the spill resulted in lesser harvests of salmon and herring and sent fish prices plummeting . Exxon had disputed the argument , denying that reduced fishing stocks resulted from the spill . Exxon had estimated the fishermen ' s losses at no greater than $ 113 million . In a statement Thursday , Exxon said it was still studying the verdict . But , it added that &quot; the amount Exxon will be called_upon to pay is subject_to adjustment , including a reduction to reflect payments already made by Exxon to many of the plaintiffs. &quot; In a third phase of the trial , which will begin Aug . 22 , testimony will focus_on a demand by the fishermen and others that Exxon pay $ 15 billion in punitive damages . Last June , the jury found that the company ' s executives and Exxon Valdez Capt . Joseph Hazelwood had acted recklessly in the events leading_up to the accident . That finding set the stage for the punitive-damages phase . Should the fishermen and other plaintiffs prevail in the amount of punitive damages they are seeking , it would be the largest such award ever . In Cordova , Alaska , fisherman Jim McCune said Thursday ' s verdict seemed &quot; awful low. &quot; McCune , a third-generation Alaska fisherman , said the spill has cost him between $ 100 # 000 and $ 120 # 000 since 1989 . &quot; The roughest years were right after the spill , 1990 and ' 91 , when fishing was very restrictive and the prices of salmon went right down into the dumphole , &quot; said McCune , who is also president of Cordova District Fishermen United , a local fishermen ' s group that is one of the plaintiffs in the suit . Pamela Brodie , associate Alaska representative for the Sierra Club in Anchorage , said she doubts the verdict will do much to deter accidents . &quot; Unfortunately , &quot; she said , &quot; the main lesson the oil_industry learned from the Exxon Valdez wreck was to unload the shipping part of the industry , so that the next time we have a big spill , it is unlikely to be a deep-pocket corporation , which means the victims may have no recourse . . . . I don ' t believe these awards will solve our problem. &quot; In July , while the jury was deliberating the fishermen ' s claims , Exxon reached a $ 20-million settlement with Alaska native groups who are parties to the same suit . The groups said the spill damaged their hunting and fishing grounds . The oil_company is also defending itself against similar charges in state court , where six Alaska native groups have filed suit seeking roughly $ 100 million . Exxon says it has paid about $ 3.5 billion so far in cleanup costs and government fines . * Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report .</TEXT>
