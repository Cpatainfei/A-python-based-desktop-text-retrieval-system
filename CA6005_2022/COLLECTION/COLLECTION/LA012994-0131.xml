   <HEADLINE> THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE ; KEY SUPER BOWL FACTORS SAY BILLS HAVE COME DUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You know what they say about professional_football It ' s three hours of things nobody understands , like two-deep zones and rushbackers and counter treys and snack trays , mixed in with two minutes of spectacular catches and courageous runs , but it is those two minutes that make somebody want to spend a car payment on a Super Bowl ticket , even though you can see the game and those hot new potato_chip commercials far better on television , though you won ' t get as close to halftime stars like Travis Tritt , but then , don ' t you ever wonder if there ' s something living_in his beard ? You know what they also say about professional_football : It ' s a game of matchups . So for Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta Sunday between the Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys , here are ours : COWBOY COACH JIMMY JOHNSON vs . BILL COACH MARV LEVY Johnson ' s news_conferences are often accompanied by much laughter , simply because he is so brazen . Levy ' s news_conferences are accompanied by much shouting , simply because the NFL ' s oldest coach has difficulty hearing . When Johnson was asked about his underwear Friday -- we are not making this up -- he referred all questions to his nearby girlfriend . &quot; Or she can tell you about my lack of underwear , &quot; he said . When Levy was asked about his underwear , he lost all color . This is no small feat , considering he has no color to begin with . Who do you trust more , your cousin with the two Corvettes or your grandfather ? Edge : Bills . COWBOY OWNER JERRY JONES vs . BILL OWNER RALPH WILSON On Monday , Jones pushed ahead of Johnson as the first speaker in the Cowboys ' first news_conference of the week . Two days later , he supplanted safety Bill Bates on one of the raised interview tables reserved for the really big stars . When we last left him there , he was talking_about kicking butt_against some unsuspecting Oklahoma oilman when he was 14 . Or something like that . Wilson gave one interview . In it , he delighted the crowd by saying , &quot; I like sports. &quot; If you paid hard-earned millions to buy a football_team , what kind of owner would you be ? You bet your brass you would . Edge : Cowboys . COWBOY QUARTERBACK TROY AIKMAN vs . BILL QUARTERBACK JIM KELLY Rumor has it that Aikman , who forgot where he was for nearly 12 hours after suffering a concussion in the NFC championship game , has relapsed . Much to the Cowboys ' dismay , he reportedly walked into practice Friday and proclaimed he was Jim Everett . They hoped that after several completions he would realize this was impossible , but no . Kelly , meanwhile , has already experienced one victory this week . Tanya Tucker , country singer and a halftime performer , throatily announced , &quot; I know some of the Cowboys , but I love Jim Kelly. &quot; That does_it . He ' s the man . Edge : Bills . COWBOY RUNNING BACK EMMITT SMITH vs . BILL RUNNING BACK THURMAN THOMAS Smith possesses one of the best smiles in the game . Thomas has made a career out of scowling . Smith is the only person in football who can get_away with filming a shoe commercial about preseason workouts . . . and then purposely miss all_of training camp in a contract dispute . Thomas is the greatest player in football who doesn ' t do any commercials . &quot; You read all_the news_articles or listen to all_the television_stations , and the people that are talking don ' t know Thurman Thomas and probably never met him in their life and write_about things they don ' t even know , &quot; Thomas said . He added , &quot; Until you get_to know me , sit_down and talk to me for a week or two , you really don ' t know what I ' m like. &quot; We tried . You told us to take a hike . Edge : Cowboys . COWBOY DEFENSIVE END CHARLES HALEY vs . BILL DEFENSIVE END BRUCE SMITH Haley , who will play Sunday despite a back injury , is_best known to his former San Francisco 49er teammates as a guy who brought a package of_his_own excrement into a team meeting . He is_best known to his current teammates as the guy who publicly derided insecure rookie running Derrick Lassic earlier this season , then smashed his helmet through a wall as an exclamation_point . He has been_best known during Super Bowl week as the man who cursed an NFL official for asking Leon Lett to talk to reporters for the first time in two months . We hear that for Bruce Smith ' s next trick , he is going_to make Sam Malone wear a dress . Edge : Bills COWBOY LINEBACKER KEN NORTON JR . vs . BILL LINEBACKER DARRYL TALLEY Norton has an interesting way of dealing with a torn biceps , which he has played with since refusing surgery three months ago . &quot; I start screaming , &quot; he said . &quot; The more I scream , the more I forget about the pain. &quot; Talley has a different way of dealing with hurt . In despair after losing a third consecutive Super Bowl , he went_to work for McDonald ' s last spring . We can only wonder who screams more . Edge : None . This one is dead even . COWBOY KICKER EDDIE MURRAY vs . BILL KICKER STEVE CHRISTIE They are both Canadian . They are both former soccer players . But whereas Murray did not miss an extra point in 38 tries this year , Christie missed one in 37 . We think those who miss extra points should be summarily removed from the field and forced to spend the rest of the game in a TV booth with Joe Theismann . And this Eddie Murray can still go_to his left . Edge : Cowboys COWBOY OFF . COORDINATOR NORV TURNER vs . BILL DEF . COORDINATOR WALT COREY Turner is a walking offensive computer . He sits in the press_box during games with charts , photos , and a complex play for every defense . During the week he walks_around the Cowboy complex , spitting_out formations the way others say , &quot; Good morning. &quot; In fact , he spits_out formations instead of saying , &quot; Good morning. &quot; &quot; He ' ll see me at breakfast and the first thing he ' ll say is , ' On the route where you take the guy deep , I think you should try to get set quicker , ' &quot; receiver Michael Irvin said . &quot; Only then will he say , ' Oh , and how you doing ? ' &quot; Corey doesn ' t sit in the press_box . He walks the sidelines . He constantly chews on a piece of straw . &quot; Just relaxes me , I guess , &quot; he said . We like that . Edge : Bills SPY vs . SPY The New York Giants recently accused the Cowboys of trying to steal signals . They were so worried , in fact , that they used an important timeout in the final game of the season against the Cowboys in hopes of thwarting them . Meanwhile , everybody in the league accuses the Bills of stealing signals . Jimmy Johnson tried to turn the tables Friday by saying that the Cowboys would not practice in the Georgia Dome because they didn ' t feel it was secure enough . Guess where the Bills have been practicing ? Edge : Cowboys CONCLUSION We know we are 0-2 in predictions this season . We know that both of our picks in the conference championship games held_up for less than 30 minutes . We know what you must think . You are not alone . But here goes . . . . We like the Bills to knock_down Troy Aikman . With his recent head problems , this could be enough to knock him out . We like the Bills to hurt Emmitt Smith . With his recent shoulder problems , this won ' t be hard . We like Jim Kelly to have the game of his life . He is having the two-month streak of his life , so why not ? We like the difference that Mark Maddox , Marvcus Patton and improved Nate Odomes make on the Bills ' defense . We don ' t like the back injury suffered by the Cowboys ' Charles Haley . We don ' t like the shortened preparation time the Cowboys have been given to counteract the no-huddle offense . Two weeks last year , one week this year . We don ' t like Alvin Harper , and we don ' t care what anybody says about his luck in big_games . We don ' t like it that the Cowboys thought the Super Bowl was last Sunday . And we love this quote from a man who knows a thing or four about Super Bowls , Terry Bradshaw . &quot; I don ' t think one more Super Bowl loss would even faze these Bills , &quot; Bradshaw said . &quot; I ' m sure Jim Kelly is thinking , ' Geez , we ' ve lost three , what the hell is one more ? ' &quot; A winning attitude if we ever heard one . Bills , 31-27 .</TEXT>
