   <HEADLINE> NIGHT_SHIFT WORKERS HAVE CHILD_CARE NEEDS TOO ; PARENTS : EVENING PROGRAMS SUCH AS ONE AT THE TORRANCE Y SEEK TO CREATE A FEELING OF FAMILY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It looks_like dinner hour in any big family . Christopher , 8 , passes_out the paper dinner_plates , Briana , 7 , and Kaylee , 3 , organize the plastic silverware . Altogether , six children sit_down together to eat . It ' s family style , but the children aren ' t at_home . During their meal of fish_sticks , scalloped potatoes and salad , Cathryn Steven , 27 , gently reminds them to stop kicking each other under the table and to try a bite of everything . They are at the new YWCA Home Away From Home Evening Care program , where Steven and the staff have created the first nighttime child_care available in the South Bay outside private homes . As more families depend_on a single parent or need both parents to work non-traditional hours , the need for flexible child_care has increased . Parents who work_at night in refineries , restaurants , hospitals , police_departments or the post_office are just a_few examples of those who need help with their children at night . Experts agree that the best place for a child to sleep is probably in his or her own bed , but not all parents can be at_home . The next-best thing seems to be care-givers who create the feeling of family -- albeit a big family . Typically , grandparents or older siblings have cared_for children while parents work . Sometimes parents could also find child_care in someone ' s home . But often tenuous arrangements for evening child_care fail , leaving parents desperate . A study by Mobil Oil Corp . found that night-shift employees at its Torrance refinery had their share of problems . One divorced father has primary custody of his 7- and 8-year-old sons . Once , when his baby-sitter didn ' t show_up , he brought his children to sleep_in his car in the parking_lot during his 12-hour graveyard_shift . Another time he decided to leave the children home alone , but panicked when he called them about 7 p.m. and got no answer . He rushed home to find them fast_asleep . One mom arranged for her son ' s preschool teacher to drop him off at the Mobil parking_lot , leaving him in her pickup_truck . When she got_out to the lot , the 5-year-old wasn ' t there . Because another mother was late picking_up her child , the teacher couldn ' t get_away for more_than half an hour . The Mobil worker said it was the most horrible feeling , not knowing where her child was . With more_than 400 employees at its Torrance refinery on rotating schedules that include nights and weekends , Mobil found that the company was suffering because of child-care complications like these . A study sponsored by the company found that it could save an average of $ 6 # 000 a month if it could curb absenteeism caused by child-care problems . Mobil approached the Torrance YWCA to create a way to help parents cope_with child_care . The first_step , a traditional preschool , opened in September , 1993 . Mobil spent about $ 50 # 000 in_labor and materials to construct the portable building that houses the daytime and evening care programs . Since it opened Sept . 14 , the evening care program has registered more_than 20 children . Parents can bring little ones to the Carson Street building from 3 p.m. to midnight Monday through Friday . The program accepts children 2 to 14 . The staff strives to create an orderly but relaxed mood . &quot; It ' s not pizza in front of the TV , &quot; says YWCA child_care director Rebecca Jessop . &quot; It ' s more structured , with a home atmosphere. &quot; Each week the group ' s activities follow a theme . One week the subject was fall , so one day the children made leaf collages , the next they studied the changes in the trees on the playground , and on the third day they painted with fall colors -- yellow , brown and orange . Children bring pajamas , a towel , a toothbrush and bedding . Bedtime depends_on the child ' s age . YWCA staff say the most important thing is to keep the children stimulated but provide a comfortable environment . For evening care the YWCA charges $ 4.50 to $ 5.50 an hour for one or two children and $ 2.50 an hour for each additional child . Dinner costs $ 3 per child . Because nurses work around the clock , much of the experience with evening child-care centers has been at hospitals . One company that used to offer its employees evening child_care was Children ' s Hospital of Los Angeles . For 10 years , the nurses on night_shift could bring their youngsters to a conference_room at the hospital for overnight care . When the furniture was shifted out of the way , children from 3 months to 16 years would camp_out between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. &quot; The nice part about it was that your child was here , &quot; said Ellen Zaman , director of patient family services for the hospital . &quot; But there are a lot of people who see a down side to night care , because the child has to be ( awakened ) very early in the morning. &quot; Besides having to move their beds and toys out of the way each day , the children washed , had breakfast and got ready for school at the hospital . &quot; From a developmental standpoint , you don ' t have much of a family life if you are_on site with your parent , &quot; Zaman said . When costs forced the hospital to charge for the sleep-over care , participants dropped from 40 to 20 . Last fall , the hospital discontinued the program and put all_of its resources into daytime care , Zaman said . Many parents feel that the best possible solution when they have to work evening hours is to find another home where their children can stay . In the South Bay , parents can find home-based evening child_care through state-funded referral lines and private associations of home-care providers . These groups offer referrals to their members , but relatively few of the home-care providers offer evening hours . Of the 80 members of the South Bay Child_Care Assn. , for example , only five offer evening care . When Kathi Darling started tending bar and taking paralegal classes at night , finding someone to trust with her baby presented a problem . Darling is separated from the boy ' s father , and the rest of her family lives in Northern California . Where could she take the cherubic 15-month-old ? &quot; When you ' re looking_for someone who ' ll let you show_up at 3 in the morning to pick him up , they ' re hard to find , &quot; Darling said . The answer turned_out to be Kathy Harrison-Imel , another single mom who has her own toddler and does evening care in her home . Harrison-Imel is listed with several of the South Bay referral lines . Spurred by the same problem , Harrison-Imel had decided that if she couldn ' t find evening care_for her daughter , Brittany , others might need help too . So about six months ago , she got a state license to care_for children in her home . Now she specializes in evening and weekend care . Mary Holmstedt is another home-based evening care provider . She estimates that hundreds of children have spent time at her home preschool and evening care center in the 15 years she has been open . Their smiling pictures hang all_over her house . A huge castle , complete with turret and slide , dominates the main room , making Holmstedt ' s house look a bit like a Little Tikes distributorship . The toy manufacturer ' s play stations -- a workbench with plastic tools , an easel , stove , sink and cupboard and a beauty_parlor set -- take_up every inch of space along the walls_in the room where the children play . But even with all_the activity , the house has a sense of order and calm , with Holmstedt smoothing the way . She instructs the children to put_back one play set before getting_out another , and helps them resolve fights over toys_with apologies and good_humor . Holmstedt has cared_for children in her Torrance home day and night since 1979 , when her own daughter needed someone to watch her twins as she worked rotating shifts for the Los Angeles Police_Department . About five nights a week Holmstedt has children in the evening , and her daytime preschool almost always has a waiting list for one of the 12 spots . Ashley , a vivacious 22-month-old-with tiny dimples and pigtails , has a mom who drives a bus on a split_shift . Ashley stays with the Holmstedts several days a week , sometimes starting as early as 4 a.m. , and at other times remaining until late evening . Like Holmstedt ' s daughter , many of the parents who need evening care come from law_enforcement . Her current roster includes the children of Torrance and Los Angeles police_officers and sheriff ' s deputies . California law requires in-home day-care providers to get a license . Their homes are inspected for safety , and they must take 15 hours of instruction each year in CPR , first_aid and infectious_diseases . Each provider can care_for up_to six children alone , or 12 with an aide , and the care cannot last more_than 24 hours . For evening care the rules are the same , although the inspector will also look_for comfortable places for the children to sleep , said Sallee Kraics of the state_Department of Social_Services . Both the YWCA and home providers stress that the tone of evening care has to be different . Mary Holmstedt and her husband encourage the children to call them Nana and Papa . &quot; that ' s what we ' re trying to show them , that we ' re an extension of their family . They ' re a part of it , so they can relax , &quot; Holmstedt says . The affectionate names reveal another reason home care is popular . Many families live far away from the traditional supports of grandparents and other family members . Most evening-care providers try to create the feeling of family and community while winding down the day . Many of the children have been in preschools earlier in the day , and need a change of pace , experts say . &quot; Anything that you could create that would be as homelike as possible would give the children a sense of comfort , &quot; says Cynthia Whitham , a staff therapist in UCLA ' s parent training_program . What children need , Whitham says , is a comforting atmosphere and a sense of structure . Laura Escobedo , associate director of the Child_Care Resource Center in North Hollywood , agrees . Her agency gets more_than 40 calls a month for referrals to evening child_care . Most parents feel home care is like taking their children to a relative ' s house rather than an institution , Escobedo says . &quot; I think that ' s what makes_it feel the most comfortable . Besides being a safe place , the child isn ' t missing out on the intimacies of settling_down for the night , &quot; Escobedo says . &quot; It kind of gives closure to the day. &quot;</TEXT>
