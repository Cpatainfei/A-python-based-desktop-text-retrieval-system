   <TEXT> The Times published articles ( March 22-26 ) on a Scripps experiment to develop an acoustic monitoring system for determining the realities of global warming possibly associated with a clear buildup of greenhouse gasses . The first article presaged a public hearing on the project that day in Washington . Unfortunately , there were many incorrect statements which subsequently led directly to a firestorm of protest in the national press . The article stated that the source was so loud that it could deafen whales ; this is incorrect . The source power is 200 watts , and this level would only be encountered if the whale ' s ear was right up against the source , which is 3 # 000 feet beneath the sea surface . Permanent damage occurs at about 60 # 000 watts . Near the surface the power is down by a factor of a_million , comparable_to loud speech . Only if a diver were to descend into the water directly above the source would the tone be apparent ; because the transmission of sound from water to the atmosphere is so inefficient , someone in a boat would n ' t be able to hear the source . As sound propagates away from the source , the intensities continue to decrease and reach the ocean ' s ambient noise_level at a distance near 150 miles ; the sound cannot be &quot; heard &quot; in New Zealand as reported in The Times . Why bother to transmit if the sound cannot be heard ? A 200-watt light_bulb on the surface of the moon could not be seen by humans on the Earth at night either . However , the light_bulb could be observed by Southern California ' s telescope at Palomar . The same is true of the acoustic signal . Acoustic arrays search for the narrow band signal and computers are further exploited to extract the coded signal . These sophisticated approaches were taken specifically to avoid the transmission of loud acoustic signals which might harm marine mammals . Your articles state that 677 # 000 whales , dolphins and seals_in the Pacific will be affected by this experiment . In fact , the National Marine Fisheries Service has a policy of listing the entire Pacific population . It is highly unlikely all these marine mammals will swim by the sources . Even if they do , they will not be harmed ; perhaps distracted if too close , but certainly not harmed . That The Times would think that we would act with callous disregard for the environment and the living creatures in the sea is extraordinary . Your sensational reporting was picked_up around the country and the fallout has done great damage . JOHN A . ORCUTT , Director Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics , Scripps Institution of Oceanography , La Jolla Scientists reportedly are willing to chance deafening marine_animals in_order to monitor global warming via ocean temperature measurements . But what government_agency is funding this experiment ? The National Weather Service ? The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ? The Environmental Protection Agency ? Nope , it ' s the Defense_Department ! Can anyone explain to me why the Defense_Department is more interested in global warming than any of the more environmentally focused agencies of our federal_government ? Especially when budget_cuts are forcing the Pentagon to eliminate its favorite toys , exotic weapons_systems . Recognizing this public-relations maneuver as a cover-up for military testing at least explains why the experiment must take_place off two of the most remote and pristine coasts in the United States ( Big Sur and Kauai ) instead of heavily populated and more convenient locations like Los Angeles and Oahu . GREGORY P . SHANK Irvine If Scripps officials had speakers placed in their environment and broadcast every four hours for 20 minutes until 2004 , I wonder how they would behave ?
