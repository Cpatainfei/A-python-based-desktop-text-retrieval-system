   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : ONLY 1 SPOUSE ' S BENEFITS AVAILABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q . I am a 64-year-old widow and still working . My husband died at age 67 before he had claimed any Social_Security benefits . Upon retirement , may I claim both widow ' s benefits and my own ? What happens to my Social_Security benefits if I invest the life_insurance proceeds I got when my husband died ? -- A.W . A . Upon retirement , you are entitled to claim the greater of the benefits -- either your own or those your husband was eligible to receive at the time of his death . Your life_insurance proceeds should not directly affect Social_Security benefits . Only being employed can reduce your monthly payments . This year , recipients under 65 lose $ 1 for every $ 2 they earn in excess of $ 8 # 040 a year ; Recipients 65 and older lose $ 1 for every $ 3 earned after they have earned $ 11 # 160 in the year . There are no earned-income restrictions on recipients older than 70 . That said , you should still understand that Social_Security recipients who do not work but still have what the government considers substantial annual income do face taxation of Social_Security benefits . This is where invested insurance proceeds could affect your Social_Security payments -- not directly , but through the tax_collector . Last year ' s sweeping changes in the rules governing taxation of Social_Security income are too detailed and complicated to describe here . Although the changes involve the internal_revenue code , your local Social_Security representative should be able to explain how they apply to you . You should also consult the Internal Revenue Service pamphlet &quot; Social_Security Benefits and Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits. &quot; To order a copy , telephone ( 800 ) 829-3676 . The American Assn . of Retired Persons is also giving_away a publication titled &quot; Will Your Social_Security Benefits Be Taxed ? &quot; To order it , call ( 202 ) 434-3870 . Home Value Transfers Cannot Be Reversed Q . In a recent column , you mentioned that some counties are pulling_out of the special program that allows older homeowners to transfer the assessed value of the residence they are selling to the new home . Does this affect homeowners who have already taken_advantage of the transfer ? -- J.L . A . No . Once homeowners have received the exemption , they will not be affected by a subsequent decision of the county to drop_out of the program . For readers who may_not be aware if it , California voters approved an initiative in 1988 allowing homeowners 55 or older to transfer the assessed value of their previous home anywhere within the state , as long as the value ( or purchase_price ) of the new residence was equal_to or less than the net sale price of the old . The initiative stipulates that homeowners could take_advantage of the exemption only if the county to which they were moving opted to participate in the special property assessment program created by Proposition 90 . So far , the boards of supervisors of 12 counties -- Alameda , Inyo , Kern , Los Angeles , Marin , Modoc , Orange , Riverside , Santa Clara , San Diego , San Mateo and Ventura -- have agreed to participate . At one point , Contra Costa County had joined , but it has since withdrawn , and Riverside County supervisors have indicated an interest in following_suit . State officials say that once taxpayers are granted the Proposition 90 exemption , it is theirs as long as they remain owners of the home . Because homeowners are entitled to a single exemption over their lifetimes , the exemptions may_not be transferred to a subsequent new home purchase , regardless of whether the county of residence is a member of the Proposition 90 program . Bond Proceeds Lose Tax-Free Status in IRA Q . If I bought municipal_bonds for my individual_retirement_account , would the interest from the bonds be exempt from taxes when I withdrew the funds ? S.P . A . Despite what you might have read or been told by some hustling investment counselor , municipal_bonds , or any other tax-exempt investment , are poor choices for an individual_retirement_account . Why ? All withdrawals of previously untaxed money from an individual_retirement_account are taxable , regardless of the type of investment the funds are in . So even if the funds are generating what would otherwise be tax-free interest , because they are in an IRA , that interest is taxable at the time the money is withdrawn . You do not want to put your IRA savings into tax-exempt securities , which typically earn less interest than their taxable counterparts , if those funds are going_to be taxed anyway when you withdraw them . Advertising Investment Yields : Yearly Is Rule Q . Why do banks and savings and loans advertise their interest_rates and yields exclusively in annual terms ? It seems unfair to list an annual yield when an account term is less than one year . -- S.T.A . A . Yields of accounts of less than 12 months maturity are &quot; annualized &quot; to make_it easier for customers to compare rates . Why ? Because there is no other commonly accepted method of advertising and comparing investment rates . Perhaps more important , thrifts are required by federal law to post only annualized yields , to help customers compare various investment opportunities , regardless of the term . Is the practice of annualizing yields unfair if an account runs_for less than one year ? that ' s a matter of some debate . Clearly , a $ 1 # 000 certificate_of_deposit earns less in six months than it would if invested for a full year , but that difference is so apparent on its face that investors should hardly be surprised . Furthermore , as long as all investments are advertised and measured by the same yardstick , savers can easily decide which is best .</TEXT>
