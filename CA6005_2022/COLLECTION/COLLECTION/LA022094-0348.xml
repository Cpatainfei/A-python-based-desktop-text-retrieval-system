   <HEADLINE> BREA ' S ROCKY REDEVELOPMENT ; GOVERNMENT : THE FBI IS ASKING WHETHER LANDOWNERS WERE COERCED AND HUD SAYS IT IS INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE MISAPPROPRIATION OF $ 400 # 000 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A decade ago , this tiny town that blossomed in the foothills with the oil boom of the early 1900s embarked_on a redevelopment project like many others proposed by countless cities looking_to put a new face on America ' s aging downtowns . City officials bought and bulldozed homes and churches , wiping_out entire neighborhoods and tearing_down historic buildings , including the Red Lantern Theater where Judy Garland once performed . The vision was to transform a tattered and run-down city core , dotted with vacant and boarded-up buildings , into a bustling , tax-producing shopping_center and modern townhouse development that would become the city ' s pride . Yet redevelopment became a sore subject in this town where many residents cherish its Old West , small-town feel amid the ungainly megalopolis that much of Southern California has become . And fierce controversy has been the redevelopment project ' s hallmark as , at long last , construction is scheduled to begin next month . Three of the five City_Council members involved in the process of property acquisition have either lost their council seats or the right_to_vote on redevelopment , following state conflict-of-interest charges , some of which were successfully prosecuted , while some were ignored , and yet others ended in acquittals . But the redevelopment rancor in Brea has taken a new and serious turn , and the question pending is whether there were violations of federal laws as well . FBI_agents have been quietly scouring the area to ask former landowners and some still fighting the city about any coercive tactics the city ' s Redevelopment Agency may have used when it went_after their land . And officials of the federal_Department of Housing and Urban Development acknowledged last week they are investigating the possible misappropriation of at least $ 400 # 000 in development grants that were distributed to the city between 1988 and 1992 , the most frantic years of the Redevelopment Agency ' s activities . HUD kicked_off its inquiry by asking Orange County , which distributes HUD funds to cities , to provide documentation for all HUD money given to Brea in recent years . The new FBI and HUD inquiries could compound the troubles of this north Orange County community of 37 # 000 residents , which touches both Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties . Federal_officials have already frozen some funds granted for highway improvements in Brea , and city officials have hired a Washington lobbyist specifically to help persuade federal_officials to release the nearly $ 2 million . The freeze was imposed after federal highway investigators concluded in July of last year that Brea officials had abused their power to take property for the widening of Imperial Highway . Their investigative report said there were indications &quot; that several property_owners were coerced to sell . . . to the city of Brea . . . which threatened acquisition by eminent_domain based on the highway project when in fact . . . ( the property ) was not being acquired for the highway project. &quot; Instead , the federal report said city officials intended to transfer the property to its Redevelopment Agency , which at the time was supposed to acquire property only on a voluntary basis . FBI officials declined to comment last week , but residents and businessmen who owned property near the highway confirmed that agents are now asking them questions about how their properties were acquired , and the city ' s use of its condemnation authority . Joseph Veltri , whose Italian restaurant was a city institution , said an FBI_agent came_to his Fullerton home two weeks ago to ask &quot; if there was any coercion or threats by city officials to get me to sell my property . I told him I felt I was coerced , &quot; Veltri said , adding that the agent expressed concerns about the lapse of time since the transaction . Bruce Weiner , a Newport Beach attorney for one of Veltri ' s former neighbors , also confirmed that the FBI has requested a meeting with him to discuss the sale of his client ' s property to the city . Like Veltri , former Brea business owner Gary MacDonald claims the city improperly threatened him with condemnation in 1987 , until he parted_with a successful auto body shop on South Brea Boulevard . In October of that year , MacDonald received a letter from the city offering him $ 455 # 400 for the shop . &quot; Should you not decide to accept this offer , &quot; the letter stated , &quot; the city of Brea does have the powers of condemnation to acquire property that may be affected by road-widening activities . Accordingly , should this voluntary acquisition not be agreed upon by you , the staff may recommend to the Brea City_Council that condemnation procedures be considered in the future for road-widening purposes. &quot; Five years later , and after he eventually sold his shop to the city for $ 535 # 000 , MacDonald said he was shocked to learn from state_Department of Transportation officials that his property was not required for the Imperial Highway widening . &quot; Our review of the attempt to acquire your property and its need for the currently proposed widening of State_Highway 90 ( Imperial Highway ) revealed that your property was , in fact , not needed for the widening project , &quot; states a June , 1992 , letter Caltrans sent to MacDonald . &quot; It ' s criminal what they ' ve done to us , &quot; said MacDonald , whose business failed after he moved it to Placentia , leaving him unemployed and bankrupt . &quot; They ' ve completely rearranged my life . Not a day goes_by without this hanging around my neck . I always thought the people are the government , the government works for the people . But in Brea , the government works for the developers. &quot; Veltri said he , too , was threatened with condemnation , and only agreed to sell his restaurant location after municipal officials told him that they would eventually use the city ' s eminent_domain , or condemnation , authority to take it . At the time , however , city policy prohibited the use of condemnation proceedings to acquire property for redevelopment . That policy was only reversed in 1989 . &quot; I was rather naive , &quot; Veltri said recently . &quot; I didn ' t know I had the power to resist . It ' s like a police_officer ordering you to the curb . You don ' t ask him by what authority he ' s ordering . . . . I didn ' t think my city was lying to me. &quot; Veltri was paid $ 379 # 968.10 , which the family used to set_up a new restaurant in Yorba Linda . But there , without a building of_his_own , Veltri said property rental and other costs drove the family out of business for good in 1989 . &quot; I invested in the restaurant because I thought we would build_on this for future generations , &quot; Veltri said . &quot; I never knew the city had to ruin people ' s lives. &quot; Veltri ' s emotional business departure from Brea was made all_the more painful in 1992 when he had to appear before the state Relocation Appeals_Board to ask_for moving expenses not paid him when he sold the original restaurant . Later , the board ordered the city to pay him $ 20 # 000 , the maximum allowed under state law . City Atty . James L . Markman denied any wrongdoing by the city , adding that Veltri was provided &quot; a very favorable deal. &quot; &quot; I feel bad for him that it didn ' t work_out , &quot; the city attorney said . &quot; I used to eat_at his place . There is pain in redevelopment . Everybody acknowledges that . But there is no other way to do urban renewal. &quot; As painful as this has been for some of the displaced residents and many business owners , the process has also taken a heavy toll among officials . A newly surfaced report by the state Fair Political Practices Commission says that Carrey J . Nelson , a Brea councilman who now abstains_from voting on redevelopment matters , escaped being hit with state conflict_of_interest charges along with former Mayors Ronald E . Isles and Wayne D . Wedin partly because the statute of limitations had run its course . &quot; Although it appears that Councilman Nelson violated these ( conflict_of_interest ) provisions &quot; by voting on matters while he had a financial interest in property in the redevelopment area , &quot; this case is being closed with no formal enforcement action ( because ) the violations are dated , having occurred over four years ago , &quot; the FPPC report says . Moreover , the FPPC noted that the Orange County district_attorney ' s office , which &quot; successfully prosecuted . . . Isles , and took . . . Wedin to trial on similar conflict_of_interest violations . . . declined to file any legal_action against &quot; Nelson . Isles was removed from office after his conviction , and Wedin , who won acquittal after a jury trial , elected to give_up his council seat . Councilman Nelson , saying that he routinely avoids speaking_to reporters , declined to comment on the 8-month-old FPPC report . Markman , the city attorney , said he was not aware of the new federal probes , but speculated that they were probably instigated by a handful of downtown residents and business owners involved in condemnation proceedings or protracted disputes over the value of_their_own properties . The leader of this loosely_knit coalition , Markman said , is William Vega , whose family has sued the city for attempting to condemn their property , which is located on a prime corner of the redevelopment area . Markman said it was Vega who spurred the district_attorney ' s investigations of Isles and Wedin . While acknowledging the Isles and Wedin investigations as unfortunate episodes in the city ' s recent history , Markman said he is confident the new inquiries will turn_up nothing improper . &quot; I have never seen a city scrutinized by so many different investigatory agencies , &quot; Markman said . &quot; I suggest that if you took the political and professional family involved in any city in Orange County , or anywhere else , and subjected them to years of these intense microscopic investigations , then nobody would come_out more unscathed than the city of Brea. &quot; Though Markman suggests that the worst is all behind , there are indications that the redevelopment project continues to tear the city apart . Last year , kindergarten teacher Kathryn Wiser ran_for City_Council on the sole pledge that she would oppose the city ' s use of its condemnation powers to take residents ' property . She won , but now finds herself an outcast among the other four council_members who are publicly committed to completing the long-delayed make-over of the old downtown . Heated exchanges with her council colleagues and city staffers have reduced her to tears on some meeting nights . &quot; The profundity of your ignorance is astounding , &quot; Markman told her at a recent public session . The city attorney said Wiser has brought difficulties on herself with her excessive requests for information and open distrust of city staffers . City_Council meetings are now a virtual arena for public venting on redevelopment problems , broadcast live to a citywide cable_television audience . The sessions often erupt into shouting matches , with residents yelling at council_members , and city staff_members chastising residents . Last week , for example , Police_Chief Donald L . Forkus was called_upon to wade into the crowded gallery to calm residents who were upset with the city ' s latest resolution to condemn Sam ' s Place , the city ' s oldest building and landmark watering-hole for locals and visitors . &quot; You ' re ruining our lives and you don ' t give a darn , &quot; said Jim Cook , whose commercial building -- Brea ' s first City_Hall and located next door to Sam ' s -- was condemned two years ago . &quot; How can anyone negotiate with this council ? Nobody is listening. &quot; Said another : &quot; Jefferson and Lincoln are probably sobbing . Shame on you , SOBs ! &quot; At two particularly rowdy points during the evening , Mayor Glenn G . Parker called_for recesses so that order could be restored . Susan Georgino , who became manager of the Redevelopment Agency in 1989 , said last week that the city had not gone_about acquiring residents ' properties in a meticulous manner . &quot; There were some things that should have been done_better , &quot; Georgino said . Georgino said the city was aware that residents and businesses had suffered financial and mental_strain as a result of the project . &quot; It ' s always difficult when you ' re acquiring someone ' s property , &quot; Georgino said . &quot; But this City_Council has bent over backward to treat people fairly. &quot; Georgino said the city used the threat of condemnation against MacDonald so that the business owner could claim a tax_benefit . When property is acquired by eminent_domain , sellers have up_to three years to reinvest their money without incurring capital_gains taxes . Other sellers have two years . Publicly , the city ' s apparent misuse of its condemnation powers was highlighted as early as two years ago , when the Brea Small Business Coalition filed a lawsuit charging that the city had failed to abide_by state law requiring a relocation plan for displaced property_owners , and did not provide_for relocation assistance . Orange County Superior_Court Judge Robert C . Todd ordered the city to prepare a relocation plan , and questioned the manner in which the city was acquiring property from landowners . The judge said the city was not giving residents &quot; good-faith &quot; information as required under state and federal laws . &quot; It appears that the city and the ( Redevelopment ) Agency have been ' picking_off ' properties one at a time without encouraging business owners , residents and tenants to participate in redevelopment , &quot; Todd said . &quot; It seems that the thrust of city efforts has been to locate major developers for the purpose of development. &quot; Markman and other city officials said Brea has been generous in providing relocation assistance , paying_out nearly $ 6 million since 1987 to move 225 households and 41 businesses . Some of those relocation expenses paid by the city , however , were part of the settlement reached in the business coalition ' s lawsuit settlement . Under terms of that settlement , the city agreed to pay_up to $ 6 # 500 to affected landowners for reimbursement of legal and appraisal fees related to property acquisition or relocation . Mayor Parker said that while some of the displaced residents and businesses had quit Brea , the city has been successful in retaining a number in new locations . &quot; We ' ve worked very hard to negotiate in good_faith , &quot; Parker said . &quot; When they ( Vega , Cook and others ) say we won ' t listen , that ' s not true. &quot; Only adding_to the controversy has been the pair picked by the city for the area ' s major project , a mixed-use development with a Ralphs supermarket , a Payless Drugs , a Cost Plus , an Edwards Cinema and a cluster of townhouses at the corner of Brea Boulevard and Imperial Highway . Chosen to build the project is a partnership involving Ray Watt , a former undersecretary for Housing and Urban Development during the Nixon Administration , and Tom Craig , the son of a former Brea mayor for whom a city park is named . Almost half of the 50-acre parcel that the city has acquired for roughly $ 26 million is being sold to the developers for $ 4.5 million . According to a Redevelopment Agency memo recounting a meeting with partnership representatives , Craig ' s &quot; political influence &quot; was duly noted . A staff memo from that April 3 , 1990 , meeting states that Tom Craig would have a 10 % limited partnership interest in the project in exchange for his &quot; $ 500 # 000 cash investment and . . . political influence. &quot; Markman denied that city staffers raised the issue of Craig ' s supposed &quot; political influence &quot; during an agency meeting . He said the memo to agency board_members was merely quoting remarks made by John Hunter , the managing partner of the Watt / Craig team . &quot; That was John Hunter talking , &quot; Markman said . &quot; It was John Hunter saying , ' I ' ve teamed_up with a guy who I believe is locally influential and he ' s got 10 % of the project. ' &quot; But Hunter said last week he did not recall making any such comment at the meeting . About Craig ' s involvement , Hunter said : &quot; Craig has invested real hard dollars to buy an interest in the property . He is an astute businessman who knows Brea . It is no secret what his abilities are . But he was willing to buy an interest to have a piece of the action , and it ' s a straightforward transaction. &quot; Hunter said the arrangement to build the shopping_center was also beneficial to the city because the local_government has been guaranteed up_to 25 % of the center ' s profits for 56 years . So far , 80 % of the shopping_center space has been rented and long-delayed construction is expected to begin in March , Hunter said . For Mayor Parker , construction will be a major landmark in a project that has consumed much of his local political career . Elected to the council in 1990 , Parker said he was prepared_for the troubles that have enveloped the project . Any violations attributed to the city in past state or federal reports , he said , were probably a result of &quot; people who had not crossed the Ts or dotted the I ' s. &quot; He said he was not aware of either the FBI or HUD inquiries . &quot; I ' m convinced nothing was done with the intention to harm anyone , &quot; he said . &quot; But one of the commitments I made was to finish the downtown and I knew we weren ' t going_to make everybody happy . We ' re beyond the point of return. &quot; The Saga ' s Chronology 1971 : City_Council declares need for Redevelopment Agency to rehabilitate blighted , unproductive areas of city . Council accepts plan establishing most of city as redevelopment area , including the old downtown . Late in the year , voters reject redevelopment proposal and plan to use condemnation authority to acquire property in redevelopment zones . 1972 : Redevelopment Agency officially relinquishes power of eminent_domain -- which allows government to claim privately owned land -- as a means of acquiring property . 1977 : Brea Mall opens . 1981 : New Civic Center opens , moving city offices from South Brea Boulevard , near old downtown , to a complex next to the mall . 1983 : Redevelopment plan amended to include commercial district in old downtown .
