   <HEADLINE> NEW YEAR ' S DAY BOWL GAMES ; MOUNTAINEERS HOPE TO AVOID LANDSLIDE ; SUGAR_BOWL : A FLORIDA VICTORY WOULD MEAN NO SHOT AT NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR WEST_VIRGINIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> OK , let ' s get right to it . Is West_Virginia worthy ? Are the Mountaineers ( 11-0 ) deserving of our attention ? Has Team Salt-of-the-Earth been shunned as it hemmed and clawed its way up the polls while no one was looking ? Or are the Mountaineers the Beverly Hillbillies in cleats , country bumpkins run amok in a sea of city folk . Should beating_up on football road kill -- i.e. Rutgers , Temple -- qualify you for the national championship of anything ? The debate may or may_not be settled tonight in the Louisiana Superdome when the No . 3-ranked Mountaineers face No . 8 Florida in the USF &amp; G Sugar_Bowl . If , as some suspect , the high-powered Gators ( 10-2 ) pass and run the Mountaineers back to the high country , the question will be moot . Florida is favored by almost a touchdown . ( See what these Mountaineers mean about respect ? ) But should West_Virginia pull_off the upset while undefeated Nebraska loses to Florida State in the Orange Bowl , the Mountaineers will be demanding their share of the national title . West_Virginia could hope for a split in the polls . The Associated Press title will no doubt go_to the Nebraska-FSU winner . But the Mountaineers rank second in the CNN / USA Today coaches ' poll behind Nebraska and could rightly stake a claim with a Sugar_Bowl victory . West_Virginia Coach Don Nehlen has backed_off the hue-and-cry tone of defending his team and respectfully offers : &quot; If we win the football game , in my opinion , we ' ll get a share of the national championship . In my opinion. &quot; Florida Coach Steve Spurrier agrees . Any undefeated team that beats his Gators should not be denied . &quot; If they go 12-0 , certainly they deserve to be a national champion , &quot; he said this week . &quot; Anybody that goes 12-0 , at the level of play they ' ve played , deserves a share. &quot; Of course , anyone who has studied Spurrier knows the thought of losing this game hasn ' t really crossed his mind this week . The Mountaineers have stated their case , noting that they were picked to finish fourth in the Big East and were not ranked before the season ; that they did not enter the coalition poll until Sept . 27 , and that contrary to reports of their schedule being a breeze , they defeated three teams ranked in the final coalition poll -- No . 10 Miami , No . 15 Boston College and No . 22 Virginia Tech . Some Mountaineers believe the poll deck was stacked from the start and that not pitting West_Virginia against Nebraska is nothing less than an injustice . &quot; I can ' t lie , &quot; said Ed Hill , a West_Virginia receiver . &quot; We think the two undefeated teams should be facing each other . Let ' s go_out and see who is the best undefeated team . Everybody wants to see Florida State win , and Bobby Bowden win his first ( national title ) . &quot; If we win , it ' s going_to be , ' Oh , West_Virginia hasn ' t played anybody. ' If we lose , everyone will say , ' See , we told you they weren ' t any good. ' So we ' re going to go_out and win for ourselves. ' &quot; Baiting the Mountaineers all week has been Jack Jackson , one of Florida ' s many star receivers . He had 51 catches and 11 touchdowns this season and figures he might get_about half those totals against a soft Mountaineer defense . And what about West_Virginia ' s boast of winning the Big East Conference ? &quot; We say , ' Yeah , you all won the Big Easy . . . ' like they have_the_best conference , with Rutgers ? I don ' t even know if West_Virginia will be the best team we ' ve played this season . &quot; Just beat us , then you ' ll have my respect . They measure their team on a win_over Miami ( 17-14 ) . I don ' t see how much that means against a team that ' s been struggling this year . When we see the film of Miami-West Virginia , we ' re not looking_at Miami of the late 1980s . And they only beat them by three points at home. &quot; One reason Jackson is licking his chops : Florida ' s offense averaged 476 yards this season , including 339 passing . The Gators have a bona_fide star at tailback in Errict Rhett , the first player in Division I history to rush for 4 # 100 yards and catch 140 passes , and four receivers -- Jack Jackson , Willie Jackson , Harrison Houston and Aubrey Hill -- who have combined for 6 # 257 and 68 touchdowns in their careers . That said , the Mountaineer defense has not been of national championship caliber , giving_up an average of 230 passing yards per game . An 11-0 secondary ? &quot; Not at all , &quot; Jack Jackson said . &quot; I didn ' t realize they give_up that many yards passing . But so be it . What do we average passing -- 330 ? Someone ' s in trouble. &quot; What Jackson doesn ' t mention is that his own defense is no great shakes either , having given_up an average of 225 passing yards , as it faces a formidable 1-2 pair of West_Virginia quarterbacks , Jake Kelchner and Darren Studstill . &quot; We need to improve in that area , we all know that , &quot; Spurrier said of his defense . Spurrier ' s offense , too , will be at a disadvantage without freshman quarterback Danny Wuerffel , who injured his right knee in the Florida State game and will not play . Wuerffel and junior Terry Dean had been sharing the position most of the season , but it was Wuerffel who led the Gators in passing with 2 # 230 yards and 22 touchdowns .</TEXT>
