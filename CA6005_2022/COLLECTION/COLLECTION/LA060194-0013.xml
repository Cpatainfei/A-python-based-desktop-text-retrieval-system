   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE ENVIRONMENT ; A NEW CONSERVATION ETHIC ; THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS BEGINS IN OUR NATIONAL_PARKS : HIGHER ENTRANCE_FEES , NEW PARKS IN UNEXPECTED PLACES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In its 1916 decree creating the National_Park_Service , Congress explicitly outlined two goals : Preserve the designated sites &quot; unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations , &quot; and provide_for the public enjoyment of those resources . The conflict between preservation and access has forced a creative tension on the Park Service since its first days . Achieving balance grows more difficult each year . As challenging as the mission is , the two goals are not contradictory , particularly when one focuses_on the nature of the genuine park visitor experience . The national_parks are not about entertainment ; Disney , Warner Brothers and others are masters at that task , and park rangers need not compete with them . Rather , rangers facilitate the American people ' s encounter with their heritage . The challenge is in bringing the visitor to a more intense appreciation of the natural world . This framework sets new and clear parameters on methods for accommodating more visitors . Despite annual increases in visitation , for example , the Park Service will not be in the road-building business . Roads disrupt , divide and fragment natural systems that are the very reason for parks ; our challenge is in finding new means of visitor transport . We will not be in the hotel-building business , but will instead work with owners of lands bordering parks so that many overnight needs can be met in gateway communities . These communities can also serve as &quot; staging &quot; areas , where visitors can learn of a park ' s facilities , collect materials and shop -- all without adding_to the milling crowds inside . Likewise , the service must consider different methods for protecting its resource base , because it is no longer enough to focus_on the nature of developments within the park . We must begin to focus_on parks not as distinct entities , but as the centers of ecosystems . At Yellowstone , massive herds of elk and buffalo ( and soon , perhaps , gray_wolves ) do not acknowledge the straight_lines on a map ; those animals inherited an entire ecosystem , and park staff must work closely with resource managers from other state and federal agencies to protect their migration range . Everglades National_Park is part of a natural system being killed by the invasion of exotic plants ( caused by nutrient-rich agricultural runoff ) and the diversion of water for residential and commercial uses . That park ' s fate lies not in the hands of its rangers , but in a massive , multi-agency effort to restore the system . Sequoia National_Park has air-quality problems worse than many large cities , but the problems ' source lies_in faraway industrial centers along the California coast and in the Central Valley . Clearly , it is no longer sufficient to label land a park and assume it is protected . Protecting the resource base also means continuing the search for new sites , because America ' s history and perspectives are always changing . Fifty years ago , there was no Martin_Luther_King Jr . Historical Site to be preserved , because that chapter in our history had not yet been written . A century ago , we crossed the Midwest in search of scenic splendor , oblivious to the extraordinary biodiversity being plowed up and taken_for granted . The new effort to create a park in the Kansas tall-grass prairie finally acknowledges the importance of that resource . Generations in search of alpine scenery simply walked on by some of America ' s most unique ecosystems . One of those regions would be protected by the California Desert Protection Act , ushered through the Senate by Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) . Unsurpassed in its scenic , biological , cultural and recreational significance , the desert has been ignored too long . Finally , protection of the resource requires a sounder financial base . A first_step would be congressional action to restore discretion to the Interior_secretary to set reasonable park entrance_fees . Currently , only three of the 367 Park Service sites charge $ 10 per vehicle , only 15 charge as much as $ 5 per car and Yellowstone ' s entrance_fee is less today than it was in 1915 . In addition , Congress can provide collection incentives to park managers by returning to the park half the money collected above the current base . Though beset by fundamental problems , the welcome sign is out at our national_parks , because the National_Park_Service can fill a unique and immediate role . We are within decades of an environmental collapse on this planet . Our urgent task is to communicate to the American people what it means to live more lightly and respectfully on the land . Any contemplation of our role in developing and teaching a new conservation ethic leads directly back to the national_parks . The parks are where this task is easiest , where the educational process begins , where it is all so extraordinarily fresh , obvious and overwhelming . The national_parks must serve as the gateway to the conservation ethic , because if that gateway can ' t be crossed in our national_parks , it can ' t be crossed anywhere .</TEXT>
