   <HEADLINE> EX-DEPUTY CHIEF CHARGED WITH HAVING LAPD RECORDS ; POLICE : DANIEL SULLIVAN ILLEGALLY GOT INFORMATION FOR HIS INVESTIGATIONS FIRM , OFFICIALS SAY . HE DENIES ALLEGATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Daniel R . Sullivan , a retired deputy police_chief once considered one of the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s brightest stars , was charged Thursday with illegally having confidential law_enforcement information in the files of his private investigation company . He is the highest-ranking former LAPD official to face criminal charges since the corruption scandals of the early 1900s , a department spokesman said . Sullivan , charged with 11 misdemeanor counts , allegedly received the confidential_information from a police_officer who has since resigned from the force . The former officer , Walter Ray Bentley Jr. , was charged separately Thursday , as was another private_detective to whom he allegedly passed information . Outspoken and personable , Sullivan was widely seen as a likely candidate to succeed Daryl F . Gates as police_chief . Before his retirement eight years ago , he was regarded_as a straight-talking &quot; cop ' s cop &quot; unafraid to take_on City_Hall politicians , members of the civilian Police Commission and even fellow officers who stepped off the straight_and_narrow and took free meals . On Thursday , he strongly denied any wrongdoing and lambasted those seeking to prosecute him . &quot; I am disappointed and I am disgusted , &quot; said Sullivan , 57 . &quot; Are the citizens of Los Angeles going_to_sleep better knowing that ( the district_attorney and Police_Department ) spent hundreds and hundreds of man-hours trying to determine if I got information that indicates someone is a crook ? &quot; At worst , he said , some files at his Woodland Hills-based Investigative Services Corp . detective_agency contained &quot; harmless &quot; information about criminal_records of people applying for jobs with his corporate clients . &quot; If I have any records that were unauthorized , I don ' t know about them , &quot; Sullivan said . &quot; But if they are , I take responsibility for them. &quot; Despite Sullivan ' s efforts to downplay the charges , police and prosecutors say the allegations are serious and underscore the department ' s efforts to counter improper and illegal trafficking in computerized information . &quot; The department hopes to send a message that you cannot get_away with this type of behavior , even if you were a deputy chief of police , &quot; said one law_enforcement official who investigated the case for the past year . &quot; Who knows where this information could have ended_up ? It could have gotten a cop or someone else killed. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Alan Yochelson , the prosecutor handling the cases , said information on various people -- including witnesses in criminal cases -- was obtained from LAPD computers by Bentley and given to Sullivan and another private_detective , Thomas Whiteaker of Whiteaker Investigative Services in Mission Hills . In one instance , Yochelson said , Whiteaker was given information on a witness in a murder case who had been relocated for his protection , and information on former actor Todd Bridges , who has had a number of scrapes with the law . Authorities declined to comment on the specific nature of the material found in Sullivan ' s possession , but said it involved the kind of confidential material turned_up in background checks . A lawyer for Bentley , who has resigned from the force , did not return calls seeking comment . Whiteaker did not respond to a request for an interview . Sullivan , who during his 25 years on the force headed bureaus on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley , has been under investigation by bunco detectives for more_than a year because of his alleged ties to Bentley , a veteran Juvenile Division officer . Sullivan aggressively projected a squeaky-clean reputation . &quot; A police_officer who accepts a free or reduced-price meal is a whore , &quot; he said in a 1983 interview . In an interview Thursday , Sullivan acknowledged knowing Bentley , and said the former officer did_work for his private investigation firm , getting court records and similar publicly accessible information . But he denied paying Bentley any money , saying instead that the two &quot; did favors &quot; for each other , which he described as a common practice between the police and private_eyes . &quot; We all have a common community , &quot; Sullivan said . &quot; We help each other. &quot; But it is that level of cooperation that worries police and prosecutors , who say they are becoming increasingly concerned about confidential_information being sold or bartered by police to private_detectives . At least one Los Angeles police_detective has been convicted in recent years for selling such information to a private_eye , and a Police Commission staffer was suspended for 10 days in 1992 for using LAPD computers without authorization to get confidential data on political figures and celebrities . From 1988 to 1992 , in fact , at least 66 sworn officers and civilian personnel were disciplined for similar misuse of department computers . An internal investigation is also under way to determine whether LAPD officials compiled confidential_information about residents and turned it over to the Anti-Defamation League . Such allegations have dogged the department for years . More_than a decade ago , it was forced to dismantle its controversial Public Disorder Intelligence Division , after it was revealed that a detective in the unit kept files at his home and made them available to an ultra-conservative group . Last summer , hidden cameras watched as Bentley received requests from the two private investigation companies , ran the names of nearly 500 people and companies through department computers and relayed that information back , according to search_warrants filed_in the case . When arrested last summer , Bentley had more_than $ 100 # 000 in cash hidden in a safe , and child pornography that authorities allege he stole from locked police evidence vaults . Bentley , 47 , already has been charged with illegally possessing child pornography . He resigned from the department earlier this year , on the same day he was to face internal departmental hearings that would have put him on_trial publicly for a host of sweeping misconduct charges . Sullivan is scheduled to be arraigned June 24 . He and Whiteaker each were charged with 10 counts of receiving criminal_records , which are confidential materials , and one count each of conspiracy to receive criminal history materials . If convicted , they each face a maximum of 5 1 / 2 years in prison and $ 11 # 000 in fines . Bentley was charged with 11 felony counts of illegal computer access and fraud , and faces a maximum of six years in state_prison if convicted .</TEXT>
