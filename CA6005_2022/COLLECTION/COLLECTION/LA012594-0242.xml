   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA CABINET FENDS OFF PREDICTIONS IT ' LL ABANDON TIGHT MONEY , REFORMS ; ECONOMY : ASSERTIONS COME IN THE FACE OF INTERNATIONAL ALARM THAT PERSONNEL CHANGES PRESAGE SHIFT AWAY FROM RADICAL MOVES OF LAST TWO YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s new Cabinet , fending off predictions that it will try to run the country Soviet-style , maintained Monday that it will stick_to free-market reforms and tight spending . &quot; The tough financial policy will not be eased to any degree , &quot; Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin said . &quot; Nobody has changed the program of reforms. &quot; Alexander N . Shokhin , the new economics minister , told reporters , &quot; There ' s no basis for the agitation in the media that the government ' s policy and the government ' s composition have altered. &quot; The Cabinet assertions came_in the face of international alarm that the resignation of reform architect Yegor T . Gaidar and the possible departure of Boris G . Fyodorov , the tightfisted finance_minister , presage a shift away from the radical reforms of the last two years . Chernomyrdin is pushing for increased subsidies to industry and agriculture to boost plummeting production , while the Gaidar camp complains that freer spending will bring_to naught all attempts to control inflation . Although it is based on economic figures , the battle over the free-market reforms increasingly appears to be political . Shokhin complained that Gaidar ' s supporters were purposely besmirching the government to discredit it in a &quot; serious political game &quot; aimed at &quot; organizing a nationwide political strike in April or May , overthrowing the government and taking power. &quot; In a reminder of the hopeless economic confusion that reigned under Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev , the Russian government is now planning to work_out plans for the reforms ' continuation in a competition among various teams of economists . Shokhin said that the teams , which include groups headed by Gorbachev-era economists Leonid Abalkin , Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin , will present their plans to the government in February and that the government will &quot; generalize &quot; them into one program . Abalkin and Petrakov &quot; are the most worrisome factor , &quot; said economist Pavel Bunich . &quot; They are inclined to reverse the movement of the entire economy. &quot; Shokhin , a former Gaidar ally who has shifted toward somewhat less radical reform , explained that when the new Cabinet talks_about &quot; non-monetarist &quot; methods of improving the economy , it does not mean a return to the Soviet style of running the country by fiat with set wages , fixed prices and state-run supply networks . Instead , he said , it means focusing more on ways to back_up budget_cuts with financial discipline -- by improving tax_collection and making_sure that government money for industry and agriculture reaches its targets instead of ending_up in factories ' foreign bank_accounts . &quot; We must dramatically increase the revenues coming_into the treasury , perhaps even by resorting_to administrative methods -- that is , to order all enterprises to report all their accounts , including overseas accounts , in filing their tax declarations , &quot; Shokhin said . He also noted that 1994 is likely to be the year when Russia ' s 5 million &quot; hidden unemployed &quot; -- people on unpaid vacations and shortened workweeks at troubled businesses -- become real unemployed and that the government has to be prepared to spend what it takes_to avoid a &quot; social explosion. &quot; The Cabinet , and President Boris N . Yeltsin as well , became more willing to dilute the reforms after the Dec . 12 elections , in which Russians ' economic hardship translated into far more votes for ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky ' s party than for Gaidar ' s reformers . Yeltsin met with Chernomyrdin on Monday for talks that reportedly dealt with the still-pending government budget_for 1994 . The Russian president had also been expected to meet with Fyodorov to discuss his resignation , but the meeting apparently never happened . Fyodorov has said he will stay in the government only if a Communist deputy prime_minister and the head of Russia ' s Central_Bank are removed . Yeltsin has not agreed to his conditions but has also seemed to reject Fyodorov ' s resignation . Gaidar resigned Jan . 16 , complaining that he was being held responsible_for the economy while being denied the power to carry_out his policies . The Russian government ' s two top Western advisers , economists Jeffrey Sachs and Anders Aslund , also quit last week , saying they could not work with the new Old_Guard . But in Washington on Monday , the Clinton_Administration ' s top Russia expert urged &quot; patience and steadiness &quot; in U.S. policies toward the reform_movement , the Associated Press reported . &quot; Many in the West are concerned that what has sometimes been called the second Russian_Revolution has failed and that counterrevolution has set_in , &quot; Strobe Talbott , special adviser to the secretary_of_state on the former Soviet republics , told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee .</TEXT>
