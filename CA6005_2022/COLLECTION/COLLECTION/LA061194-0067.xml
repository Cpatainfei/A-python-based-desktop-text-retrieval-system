   <HEADLINE> FINALLY , SOME HELP FOR RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After more_than two deadly months of inexcusable delays , Rwanda may finally get some help . This year there have been at least 2 million people killed there , solely because of their tribal identification . Unfortunately , stopping the slaughter isn ' t the mandate of the 5 # 500 African peacekeepers expected to go_to the Central African_nation under the auspices of the United Nations . At the insistence of an overly cautious Clinton_Administration , the U.N. Security_Council is directing the troops to protect Rwandans by setting_up havens without ordering the soldiers to stop the massacres . Mindful of the disappointing results of the massive and expensive U.N. intervention in Somalia , the Clinton_Administration should express some caution . But the Administration imposed burdensome conditions that delayed the peacekeeping effort . The Administration acknowledges some of the killings as acts of genocide . But a broader recognition of the wholesale slaughter as genocide would require the United States and other nations to intervene under a 1948 international accord . Political semantics cannot disguise the Hutus ' systematic elimination of Tutsis , the minority tribe that dominated Rwanda . When the first Hutu president , Juvenal Habyarimana , was killed in a suspicious plane crash April 6 , his death triggered this latest round of bloodletting . Hutus , however , aren ' t the only killers . Last week , Tutsi rebels killed Roman_Catholic clergy who were apparently members of the Hutu tribe . Burundi ' s president , Cyprien Ntaryamira , also died in the airplane crash , but his death did not precipitate a mass attack . However , previous tribal rampages have claimed more_than 200 # 000 Tutsis and Hutus in Burundi . Crisis is common in Africa , so common that Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe believes the Organization of African Unity ought to have an intervention force at its disposal . Mugabe is right . He is expected to call_for a mechanism that would allow the OAU to ask countries to provide troops . In the meantime , Mugabe is one of 14 African leaders who is committing troops to Rwanda as part of the U.N. peacekeeping force . The peacekeepers , equipped with the weapons and logistical support they need , should arrive as soon as possible .</TEXT>
