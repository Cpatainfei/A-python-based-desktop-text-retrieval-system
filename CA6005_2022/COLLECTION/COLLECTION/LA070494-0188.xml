   <HEADLINE> THE PACIFIC ; CHINA CRITICIZES FOREIGN INVESTORS FOR HIDING PROFITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China on Saturday sharply criticized the &quot; capital games &quot; of foreign investors who whisked their profits out of the country through accounting deceptions and tax_evasion . &quot; We welcome foreign businessmen ' s investment in China and will protect their lawful rights and interests , &quot; the official People ' s Daily said . &quot; But we will absolutely not allow foreign businessmen to seek exorbitant profits , to violate our country ' s laws , or to use all sorts of illegitimate means to extract ( profits ) . &quot; The article , headlined &quot; Capital Games and Profit Leaks , &quot; accused some foreign investors of using many fraudulent methods to deny China its rightful share of taxes and profits and to secretly spirit foreign currency abroad . In one survey , the newspaper said , more_than half the foreign-funded ventures had failed to pay in their full amount of registered capital . Some foreign firms had jacked_up the price of the equipment they put into the Chinese investment or used poor-quality machinery to artificially boost the size of their investment . Some foreign ventures exaggerated their rate of dividend or the prices of the raw_materials they used , the article said . Others padded their local expenses and shipped their finished goods back to the head office at below cost . The article admitted that China ' s frenetic emphasis on foreign investment , as part of economic reform , had led to some abuses . &quot; In recent years , many places linked the number of established foreign-funded ventures with the achievements of local leaders , which gave_rise to false enterprises , &quot; it said . The newspaper , demanding a &quot; strict and standard &quot; system , said laws must be strengthened , particularly those aimed at curbing tax_evasion . China this year reported a sharp drop_in foreign investment from the record levels of 1993 , when legions of board directors flocked to Beijing in a race to participate in the world ' s fastest-growing economy . Official media have reported that contracted foreign investment in the first five months of 1994 was $ 32.7 billion in 20 # 230 projects , against $ 58.76 billion in 43 # 632 projects in the first_half of 1993 . In the first_quarter , contracted investment was $ 25.39 billion in 10 # 739 projects , down 51.3 % and 43.6 % respectively from the same 1993 period . In the whole of 1993 , contracted foreign investment was $ 122.7 billion , up 76.7 % on 1992 , a figure China said was the highest in the world . Economists blame the drop on fewer privileges offered to joint_ventures , stronger competition for investment dollars and tighter credit policies by Beijing that have cut growth , especially in real_estate . Some foreign business people have said they are wary of the dangers of investing in China , which is wrestling with an economy on the verge of overheating . Separately , China said Sunday it hoped to rejuvenate its sagging Class B share markets by adopting unified national regulation of the shares , which Chinese firms sell to foreigners to raise foreign capital . National newspapers also said China ' s central_bank is moving anew to seize control over the ill-regulated investment fund market , ordering a temporary halt on new funds and banning other agencies from approving funds .</TEXT>
