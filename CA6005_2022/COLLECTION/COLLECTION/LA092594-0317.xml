   <HEADLINE> STATE ETHICS BOARD CUTS TIES WITH LOS ANGELES PANEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The head of the state agency that investigates political corruption has accused his counterpart at the Los Angeles Ethics Commission of a series of ethical lapses -- problems so severe that he said he has cut_off interaction between the two agencies . Ethics Commission Executive_Director Ben Bycel leaked confidential_information , threatened attorneys and botched sensitive negotiations by shifting his positions , according to a letter by Wayne Ordos , executive_director of the state Fair Political Practices Commission . Bycel called the letter -- delivered last week to state and city ethics commissioners -- a &quot; vicious personal attack. &quot; He said he believed the complaints about him were rooted in the state agency ' s jealousy that the upstart city Ethics Commission helped launch a series of high-profile investigations into political money_laundering . At the regular city Ethics Commission meeting Thursday morning , members voiced support for Bycel . &quot; It ' s a very unfair attack on Ben , and we have full confidence in him , &quot; Commissioner Ed Guthman said . Commission President Dennis Curtis said Bycel is doing a great job . The Ethics Commission and Fair Political Practices Commission collaborated on several investigations , in large part because the city agency has a small staff and no in-house attorneys to investigate corruption . For example , city ethics officials uncovered a money_laundering scheme by Evergreen America Corp. , a giant shipping firm . State agency lawyers and investigators helped prove the allegations , resulting in a record $ 895 # 000 fine and Evergreen ' s admission that it funneled $ 172 # 000 in campaign contributions through third_parties . But while the public was being told of cooperative efforts to blot_out corruption , tensions were quietly simmering between the state agency and Bycel , Ordos acknowledged in his letter . The five-page letter depicts Bycel as a publicity-hungry zealot who could not keep private discussions about pending cases to himself . Ordos accused Bycel of telling the press of the Evergreen settlement before it was to be announced at a public Ethics Commission meeting . He also accused Bycel of asking to time the announcement of another significant case to a major sporting event to get more publicity . ( No further explanation was given_in the letter. ) And Ordos noted that a Superior_Court judge ordered Bycel to drop_out of another investigation earlier this year after the judge found that Bycel had shown bias toward the subjects of the inquiry . The latter investigation involved relatives and associates of Arthur Snyder , a former city councilman and influential City_Hall lobbyist . Snyder has not been accused of any campaign violations and denies wrongdoing . The Ethics Commission and political practices commission have also been investigating political contributions by employees and associates of the Los Angeles Marathon . No one has been accused of wrongdoing in that case , and that investigation is continuing . It is unclear how the rift between the two agencies will affect those investigations . &quot; We have long been concerned about your apparent inability to disengage your personal feelings and biases from our cases , &quot; Ordos said in the letter . &quot; My staff has reported a number of instances in which you have asked them to focus_on ' getting ' one person or another even though the facts were not yet in place to warrant such a prosecution. &quot; Ordos also concluded that after an initial tip from the Ethics Commission , &quot; virtually everything done &quot; to settle the watershed Evergreen case was the result of the state agency ' s work . Bycel hotly contested that assertion and most others in Ordos ' letter , saying that the Ethics Commission had carried at least half the burden by exposing the money_laundering by the shipping firm . Bycel also denied that he had leaked information to the news media or others . He declined to discuss most other specifics in Ordos ' letter but said &quot; philosophical differences about what the public expects from an enforcement agency &quot; are at the heart of the dispute .</TEXT>
