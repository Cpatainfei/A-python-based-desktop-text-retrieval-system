   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS FIND ANTI-BLEEDING BLOOD PROTEIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists have discovered a key blood protein that prevents bleeding in people being treated for cancer or blood_disorders . Such bleeding can be fatal , and doctors often reduce or delay chemotherapy , which suppresses the body ' s manufacturing of blood_cells critical to clotting , because of the threat . Experts say the discovery may be the next major breakthrough in the biotechnology industry . The protein prods the body into making platelets , microscopic disks in the blood that rush to the sites of injury and clump together to stop bleeding . The finding of the protein is reported in today ' s issue of the journal Nature by two independent research teams . One included scientists at Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. ; the other team was from ZymoGenetics Corp . of Seattle and the University of Washington School_of_Medicine in Seattle . The protein stimulates the creation of specialized blood_cells that make platelets , and makes the cells mature . Scientists found animal versions of it and then identified the human gene for it , which revealed the chemical makeup of the human version . The Genentech-Mayo team reported using the gene to make the human protein . Treatment with the new protein may let doctors give more effective doses of cancer medicines .</TEXT>
