   <HEADLINE> HENRY CISNEROS AND THE POLITICS OF AMBIVALENCE ; THE GREAT LATINO POLITICAL HOPE HAS TWICE CHOSEN HUD OVER ELECTORAL POLITICS . WHERE ' S HENRY ' S FIRE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Henry G . Cisneros , the secretary of Housing and Urban Development , is standing_in a muddy tent city in the San Fernando Valley , talking to a TV_reporter . It is Week 2 of post-earthquake reality in Los Angeles , and the secretary has been in town for most of the aftershocks , doing what he clearly likes to do best : turn the wheels of Big Government . His sleeves are rolled_up , his collar is open , and his hands are tucked inside the pockets of a khaki jacket . His sad eyes look intently into the television_camera , and he speaks easily into the microphone . On Jan . 17 , it was Cisneros who broke the news of the earthquake to a still-sleeping President Clinton , jet-lagged from his whirlwind European tour . The HUD secretary had been in a Washington TV studio , waiting to do a Martin_Luther_King Jr . birthday segment on CBS ' &quot; This Morning , &quot; when Los Angeles shook . He phoned the White_House and then delivered to the world Clinton ' s first response to the disaster . The President &quot; would immediately begin talking with the appropriate federal emergency officials and put them into action , &quot; Cisneros said . Within hours , he and Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena were dispatched to Southern California . Since then , Cisneros has been all_over quake-shattered L.A. He has confabbed with both of California ' s senators , with Gov . Pete Wilson and L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan ; wheeled and dealed to free up emergency HUD housing vouchers , toured South-Central and visited shelter after shelter . In English and Spanish , the language he had to relearn , he has chatted with quake victims standing in water_lines and living_out of their cars . From a distance , the secretary looks every bit the classic politician , cruising for photo ops , mining every opportunity to meet and greet -- running hard . But up close , in the glare of the TV lights , something is wrong with this picture . Tonight , for instance , Cisneros has none of the calculated polish that burnishes most politicians . He ' s wearing the same blue slacks he ' s had_on for a week ( he packed in a hurry and has stayed longer than he planned ) , and there is neither a bodyguard nor an advance man in_sight . Standing_in front of the camera , he speaks in the form of public-service announcements , not flashy sound_bites . Shelter is available , Cisneros says earnestly ; take_advantage of it . He is behaving like he ' s doing a job , not campaigning for one . This is a new Henry Cisneros . Just six years ago , he was the bright light in New West politics , a young , brainy fast-tracker with media flair . The four-term Latino mayor of San Antonio , some said , might even have White_House potential . Then he bowed_out of the political high life , an almost willing victim of_his_own tragedies . His third child , John Paul , had been born with a life-threatening congenital heart defect , and Cisneros had confessed , in a wrenching mea culpa , to an image-destroying extramarital affair . He retreated ; it wasn ' t until another Los Angeles calamity , the riots of 1992 , and the political ascendance of Bill_Clinton , that the tug toward public_service overcame his acquired aversion to the spotlight . Now , at 46 , he ' s back , but the transformation is startling . The country ' s first Latino with presidential potential , a man whose charisma once outshone his ambition , has been reborn as a glorified civil_servant . He has twice turned_down chances to pursue a Texas Senate seat , an office he had a good chance of winning and one that would have thrust him back onto the fast track . Instead , he has chosen to run HUD , historically one of the lowest-profile and least-effective Cabinet agencies . The new Henry Cisneros seems to be an oxymoron : a politician who won ' t run , a star turned bureaucrat . Where ' s Henry ' s fire ? &quot; I BELIEVE AMERICA IS IN TROUBLE , AND I BELIEVE HUD IS AT THE CORE OF it. &quot; From the confines of a coach-class airplane seat , Cisneros ' voice punctuates each word , his right_hand slashing the air . &quot; We ' re dealing in an area that is our potential killer -- gangs , the loss of our youth , central_city problems , race and class divisions . And , in four years , I think I can do a lot about it. &quot; Cisneros is shuttling home to Washington after a short tour outside the Beltway , doing his duty as a Clinton Cabinet member . It is mid-November , and on this day , he has participated in the 15th anniversary celebration of the Mission Park housing_development in Cambridge , appeared at two fund-raisers for Boston-area Rep . Martin T . Meehan ( whose arm he twisted on behalf of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ) , offered advice to the newly elected Boston Mayor Tom M . Menino , submitted to a grilling by the Boston Globe editorial staff and delivered a speech ( to housing developers at the Urban Land Institute ) and a pep talk ( to his own Boston HUD troops ) . At 8 p.m. , he ' s still more_than willing to discuss business , setting_out what he hopes to accomplish in his return to public life and , not incidentally , defending his decision to take_on HUD . For more_than a decade , urban problems have been escalating while HUD ' s budget has been shrinking . Not surprisingly , it has become increasingly unable to serve its major purpose : housing the poor . In 1974 , HUD had about 14 million units to shelter an estimated 8.9 million low-income households . By 1993 , the number of HUD units had shrunk to about 10.6 million , while the number of households needing assistance had risen to 14.3 million . For fiscal 1994 , HUD has a budget of nearly $ 25 billion ( not counting $ 500 million in emergency earthquake relief money ) . Yet according to the General Accounting Office , the agency faces , among other bills coming due , $ 20 billion in immediate repairs on its housing stock . The department has also been coping_with a scarred reputation . In the 1980s , 11 high-level Reagan appointees -- including three former undersecretaries and the executive assistant to Secretary Samuel R . Pierce Jr . -- were indicted and convicted for influence peddling , and one private escrow agent was dubbed &quot; Robin HUD &quot; for embezzling an estimated $ 6 million in government funds . As one close friend of Cisneros put it , &quot; HUD is not a steppingstone to anything other_than an appearance before the grand jury. &quot; The Bush_Administration made a clean sweep , appointing Jack Kemp to head the agency , but its moves to safeguard HUD from more corruption , and its basic bias against social_welfare spending , only made matters worse when it came_to yet another lingering problem : HUD has a bureaucracy so leaden that even where money has been appropriated , it ' s difficult to get_it spent . &quot; I have to get written permission from Washington just to drive the agency car from San Francisco to Sacramento , &quot; says Art Agnos , former mayor of San Francisco and current western regional administrator for HUD . &quot; Employee initiative is not encouraged here . You are rated for the number of times you pick_up the ball without dropping it , not how many hits you ' ve had. &quot; &quot; I knew from the very beginning that there were serious management problems that could not be dealt with with Band-Aids , &quot; Cisneros says . He was so eager to begin the daunting effort to make the department work that in February of last year he beat his friend , Vice_President Al Gore , to the punch . Three weeks before the formation of Gore ' s National Performance Review , known as &quot; Reinventing Government , &quot; Cisneros launched his own campaign called &quot; Reinventing HUD. &quot; Cisneros ' reinvention scheme sounds like a New Age blend of the technocratic and the socially conscious . Instead of the typical organizational pyramid -- CEO on top , the lowliest worker at the bottom -- Cisneros says he wants to create &quot; the right-side-up company , &quot; where the most important_person is the one who meets the public . &quot; that ' s a pretty damned interesting concept , you know , &quot; he says . He oversees 13 # 500 employees in 71 field offices at HUD , and Cisneros has asked all_of them for suggestions on how to streamline the organization . He has also appointed a &quot; management excellence team , &quot; composed of 10 staffers , to act_as a clearinghouse for bottom-up ideas . The first major change : Ten regional operations -- bottlenecked intermediaries between field offices and Washington headquarters -- will be eliminated . Cisneros is not limiting HUD ' s &quot; reinvention &quot; to the New Democrat ideal of efficiency in government , however . He is also pushing for philosophical renewal , a return to the liberal tenet that big government can work . On the shuttle from Boston , Cisneros runs_through his top five priorities in wonkish style : neatly outlined and prioritized . &quot; Assisting the homeless , &quot; he begins , snapping open his pinkie from a closed fist . &quot; Improving public housing. &quot; The ring_finger pops_out , and then two more fingers : &quot; Expanding housing opportunities . Opening housing markets. &quot; Finally , the thumb unbends . &quot; And empowering communities. &quot; Then , as if to indicate that his task is done , he slowly glides his open hand , palm downward , away from his body in an awkward , theatrical gesture . Dramatic flourishes and reinvention claims notwithstanding , Cisneros ' priorities don ' t seem all that different from his predecessor ' s . Jack Kemp also spoke_of assisting the homeless , improving public housing and expanding housing opportunities . But , says Cisneros , under Kemp ' s watch , HUD only marked time . According to the conventional wisdom , the secretary , a contender for the top spot in the Republican_Party , was Bushwhacked . &quot; Jack Kemp worked in a Bush_Administration that was thwarting every idea at every turn and was totally disengaged from a domestic agenda , &quot; Cisneros says . Kemp wasn ' t even able to get his boss to sign a bill financing economic development zones , the secretary ' s pet project , which would have offered businesses willing to locate in distressed urban_areas a sizable reduction in capital_gains tax . Perhaps Kemp ' s biggest achievement , aside from restoring the agency to some measure of respectability after the corruption scandals , was to set_in_motion tenant ownership of public housing , making_it possible for some of HUD ' s clients to purchase the units they lived_in . Clinton -- &quot; a President who cares about a sense of community and a domestic agenda , &quot; says Cisneros -- ran_for office promising to continue Kemp ' s tenant ownership program . It is a measure of the weight Cisneros carries at the White_House , as well as his differences with Kemp , that he discarded the program almost as soon as he was sworn_in . &quot; I am generally laudatory of the job that Kemp did , &quot; Cisneros says , &quot; even beyond what is probably wise , considering he may be the Republican nominee in 1996 . But it ' s not realistic to think that large public-housing developments can be sold to people who live_in them and saddle them with the deferred maintenance cost. &quot; He insists that Kemp ' s program was aimed at ultimately taking government out of the business of housing the poor , a responsibility that Cisneros says Washington can ' t avoid . At the same time , he insists , HUD has not abandoned the goal of tenant home ownership . The secretary rarely fails to mention it in his public appearances , and he knows the statistics of falling home ownership in the U.S. by heart . The agency , he says , is exploring other methods -- making refurbished FHA repossessions available , using housing vouchers to cover not just rent but mortgage payments and creating no-down-payment government home loans . Of all_of HUD ' s priorities , dealing with homelessness has consumed most of Cisneros ' attention . &quot; I think there ' s been an unspoken effort to hide the problem , to sweep it under the carpet as though it doesn ' t exist , &quot; he says . &quot; But it ' s a problem so large in our society that we can ' t just simply hide it. &quot; Once again , his idea is to get the government more involved . To that end , Cisneros asked Congress in 1993 to make four amendments to his budget , dou bling the expenditure on homeless programs by shifting money from other projects . For 1995 , the agency ' s total appropriation could increase to $ 29.5 billion ( one of only a handful of increases Clinton is asking_for ) and homeless expenditures could nearly double again , to $ 1.5 billion . With the money , Cisneros plans to step_up a &quot; continuum of care &quot; -- funding permanent housing , temporary shelters , job placement programs and mental-health and drug treatment for the homeless . For all his emphasis on homelessness , Cisneros made his biggest splash in 1993 with priority No . 5 , &quot; empowering communities. &quot; In September , he went_into the town of Vidor , Tex. , famous for its Ku Klux Klan connections , and personally took_charge of a public housing project where black families had been harrassed and forced to leave . In January , HUD ordered armed guards to accompany blacks moving_back into the Vidor projects . And Cisneros has also campaigned hard against home-loan redlining . With the cooperation of Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , HUD and the Justice_Department are setting_up sting operations to target problem areas . Such actions have earned him a reputation as the Clinton_Administration ' s chief defender of civil_rights . &quot; At one Cabinet meeting , I laid_out what I thought ought to be the values of our joint community strategy , &quot; Cisneros says . &quot; These values included a commitment to reducing the spatial separations in American society : race , income and class . The President was very , very sympathetic . I was sitting right next to him , and I asked him : ' Do you like it ? ' And he said : ' Do I like it ? It ' s what I ran_for office to do. ' &quot; The National Journal , in its November &quot; Cabinet Scorecard , &quot; cited Cisneros as one of the &quot; emerging stars &quot; on the Administration ' s team -- the President ' s &quot; Hispanic on the spot &quot; and a &quot; good soldier &quot; on issues close to Clinton ' s heart . He got high marks for assembling a first-rate team and for his hard stand on desegregation . Paul Leonard , of the Washington-based Center_on Budget and Policy Priorities , a watchdog agency for the poor , credits his &quot; effective agenda &quot; and a &quot; head on &quot; approach . Cisneros also has his share of critics . The National Journal knocked his &quot; vague &quot; message . Others say he can be long on symbolism and short on substance , and they talk_about his first year at HUD as an exercise in headline grabbing -- sleeping_in a dilapidated subsidized housing_development in New York ; attending the funeral of a homeless District_of_Columbia woman who died at HUD ' s front_door . &quot; Henry ' s just like every_other career politician who has never done anything else , &quot; says Doug Harlan , a former political foe in Texas . &quot; He ' s always looking_for the cheap way up. &quot; But for the most part , even among HUD ' s jaded ranks , Cisneros seems to be working his old , charismatic magic . At Boston ' s Tip O ' Neill federal building , Cisneros walked in late to his meeting with northeastern HUD staffers . With rain dripping off his hair and suit , he had 20 minutes before his next engagement , and his audience was not feeling charitable . Cisneros was there to talk_about &quot; reinventing &quot; their office and , ultimately , shutting_down the regional operation . He stood behind the podium for less than two minutes , just long enough to apologize for his tardiness , then swiftly moved off the platform to stand at the front of the first row . Yes , he said , his hands were tied -- everyone had to absorb budget_cuts . &quot; Some of you may be reassigned , &quot; he told the audience . &quot; None of you will be losing your job involuntarily. &quot; Then he hit his stride . &quot; I want to get_to the point where we are doing real_things , &quot; he said , &quot; housing people who need housing , who ought to not be living_in the squalid conditions they ' re in . I want to fix that on our watch . At the end of this time , when you go_to a cocktail_party and people ask you where you work , you ' ll say ' I work_at the United States_Department of Housing and Urban Development , ' instead of having to avert your eyes. &quot; It was vintage Cisneros , playing to a skeptical , then enamored , crowd . One employee stood_up and said : &quot; I am more encouraged than I ' ve ever been . I ' ve worked_at HUD for 21 years , and this is the first time I ' ve ever even seen a secretary. &quot; The audience burst into loud applause , and Cisneros , his face suffused with a missionary glow , was off again into the New England rain . IT IS A LITTLE IRONIC THAT Henry Cisneros is in_charge of America ' s housing . Throughout his years in Texas politics , first as a San Antonio City_Council member , then as mayor , his record on housing was spotty , some would say dismal . In 1986 , during Cisneros ' third term as mayor , a study by the Center_on Budget and Policy Priorities determined that San Antonio ' s housing problems were among the worst in the nation . For 44 % of the city ' s poor , shelter was overpriced and woefully substandard , and in the years that Cisneros held office , the availability of low-cost units declined precipitously . Cisneros admits that housing and many other &quot; neighborhood &quot; issues were a low priority for him as mayor . &quot; I ran_for office with a very clear agenda : jobs and economic development , &quot; he says . &quot; I believed that the best social program we could put_together was a growing economy. &quot; Cisneros worked to improve San Antonio ' s infrastructure , including sewers and sidewalks , but his emphasis was_on flashier projects : new office_buildings , shopping_centers , a biotech research park , a $ 125-million Sea World and the $ 186-million , 65 # 000-seat Alamodome . It amounted to a swift kick from small_town status to city stature for San Antonio . It was also just about the only &quot; progressive &quot; political_platform that stood a chance in San Antonio . In 1981 , when Cisneros ran_for mayor , Latinos alone could not elect a candidate , despite their growing political clout . The conservatives who ran the town opposed change at every turn , which meant that not only Mexican Americans but also anyone with new ideas , including those who wanted to share_in the ' 80s economic boom , were out of luck . Cisneros turned_out to be a winning coalition candidate for San Antonio ' s shut-out factions . For Anglo yuppies , there were his impeccable credentials : advanced degrees in urban_planning and public administration from Harvard ' s John Fitzgerald Kennedy School of Government and George_Washington University , a stint as a White_House Fellow and as an assistant to Elliot Richardson , Richard M . Nixon ' s secretary of Health , Education and Welfare . He ran_for and won a seat on the San Antonio City_Council in 1975 , at the ripe old_age of 27 , under the banner of the Good Government League , a slate representing the city ' s pro-business moderates . For Latinos , Cisneros was one of_their_own , son of George , a military civil_servant , and Elvira Cisneros . He grew_up on Monterey Street ( &quot; a Norman Rockwell experience , &quot; says Cisneros , &quot; except that ( everyone ) had brown faces &quot; ) ; he skipped fourth grade at Catholic_school and made_good at Texas A &amp; M and beyond . He could comfortably shoulder the aspirations of the well-off and the less affluent in the Mexican American community , even if he did have to refresh his Spanish . He was by no means a radical . &quot; I always viewed Henry Cisneros as very capable and very committed , &quot; says Ernesto Cortes , who founded Communities Organized for Public_Service , a highly touted neighborhood-issues group . &quot; But I knew he was not going_to identify totally with the have-nots . No one has ever defined Henry Cisneros as an activist. &quot; Cortes often found himself at_odds with Cisneros ' development policies . COPS successfully battled Cisneros ' efforts to construct a nuclear_power plant outside San Antonio in the early 1980s but lost the fight over the Alamodome , which many San Antonian critics consider more a monument to Cisneros ' ego than a boon to their city . Cortes can criticize the man he calls &quot; a worthy adversary and a good friend , &quot; but he won ' t lay the blame for San Antonio ' s housing woes on Cisneros . &quot; It ' s because of 100 years of neglect , &quot; he says . Paul Leonard at the Center_on Budget and Policy Priorities agrees . &quot; The main reason for San Antonio ' s low-income housing problem is that San Antonio has a much higher proportion of low-income people than most cities , &quot; he says . Still , Cisneros says that if he were to do_it over again , he would have made housing a top priority . &quot; If I had stayed longer -- and , under normal circumstances , I would have liked to have stayed 10 or 12 years instead of eight , &quot; he says -- &quot; I would have started to build that social platform based on the accomplishments on the economic front. &quot; But circumstances surrounding Cisneros ' final years as mayor of San Antonio were definitely not normal , at least not for a Catholic Mexican American in a socially conservative city . Until 1987 , Cisneros had what looked_like a charmed life . His home number and address were listed in the phone_book , and reporters often stopped by his house on West Houston Street ( the same house where his grandparents had lived ) without an appointment . His personal life , with his wife , Mary Alice -- they met when they were teen-agers -- and his two daughters , Teresa Angelica and Mercedes Christina ( then 16 and 12 ) , was an open book . He was elected in 1981 and then breezed_through three reelection landslides . A fifth term seemed a certainty , and he was seriously considering running_for governor or senator . But his personal and political fortunes began to unravel . On June 10 , 1987 , the day before Cisneros turned 40 , his son , John Paul , named in honor of the Pope , was born with a serious heart defect . He wasn ' t expected to survive childhood . John Paul was the boy all_of San Antonio knew Cisneros had longed for . The family was devastated . There were other whispers as well . The 39-year-old wife of a wealthy local jeweler , who had been working_on Cisneros ' possible run_for the Texas governorship or the U.S. Senate , was said to be much more to the mayor than just his political fund-raiser . When a local newspaper_columnist wrote obliquely about his knowledge of an extramarital affair involving an unnamed , well-known public figure , the whole city knew he was talking_about Henry . Perhaps because the strain of keeping secrets was alien to Cisneros , or because his guilt was weighing too heavily on him , he finally admitted his deep love for the woman . &quot; I guess human_beings just aren ' t made of plastic and wiring and metal ; they are made of flesh and blood and feelings , &quot; Cisneros said . During the height of the rumors , he had announced that he would not run_for the Texas governorship or the U.S. Senate . Nor would he seek reelection as mayor . The only thing that mattered_to the tortured Cisneros now was his family . Mary Alice soon filed for divorce . But Catholic San Antonio -- or rather , Mexican San Antonio -- somehow saved the marriage . According to the Washington Post , Cisneros received hundreds of letters , some in support , some vitriolic , from his loyal constituents . Many offered the same advice : Don ' t let tu hijito die . Por Dios , fix your marriage . ON A PLUMP COUCH IN their new , rented house in Washington , Cisneros and 6-year-old John Paul are engaged in a minor battle of wills . Mary Alice has just served a chicken dinner , and now she and Cisneros are trying to talk to a reporter while John Paul -- &quot; mijo &quot; is what his father always calls him -- vies for their attention . When order is restored , Cisneros works his way through the story of his life . Even with dozens of photographs chronicling his political career decorating the room , he manages to be convincing when he says that , after 1989 , he had no plans to return to public life . &quot; For the first time , I was beginning to have some of the security associated with income , &quot; he points_out . As mayor of San Antonio , Cisneros was paid only $ 58 a week plus expenses ; he supplemented this with speaking fees around the country . &quot; I can ' t begin to tell you how tight things were. &quot; After he left_office , he started earning an income in the multiple six figures from television and radio programs , corporate lecturing , board memberships and his investment_firm , the Cisneros Asset Management Co . -- which handled investments for government , colleges and labor_unions . &quot; It was going_to really amount to something . So I wasn ' t sure that I wanted to be involved in politics at all. &quot; Not that he had abandoned that world completely . Cisneros stayed in touch with Latino political organizations , and in 1991 , he organized a conference of 300 Mexican-American leaders and the new president of Mexico , his old Harvard classmate Carlos Salinas de Gortari . He also indulged in another kind of armchair politics . Late at night , he immersed himself in one civilization or another , reading everything he could get his hands on . He investigated ancient Greece , the Aztecs , China , Mesopotamia , the_British Empire . It is a habit that continues : &quot; I study the accumulated effect of culture , &quot; Cisneros says . &quot; It gives me a whole different take_on humankind and our place in it. &quot; The way he tells it , it was a crisis in American civilization that drew him back to politics . When the Los Angeles riots broke_out in April , 1992 , he telephoned his friend Mayor Tom Bradley , a condolence call of sorts , he says . He ended_up having a long conversation with City Councilman Mike Hernandez . &quot; He told me , ' This thing has the potential of going_into a black and Latino thing . I don ' t know how bad it ' s going_to be , but we may need your help. ' I was there by 5 o ' clock the next day. &quot; When Cisneros arrived_at Burbank airport , he was picked_up by Bradley staffers and given a tour of the city . It was a bit of an epiphany . &quot; The sky was orange . It was like ' Apocalypse Now , ' &quot; he remembers . &quot; It was unbelievable , man . If Mayor Bradley ( had ) said : ' Henry , drop what you ' re doing , sever your business_relationships . I want you to be deputy mayor of Los Angeles and help us work this out , ' I ' d have done it. &quot; Bradley didn ' t ask , but Cisneros ' political juices had begun to flow again . Then when his friend , actor Edward James Olmos , led several hundred broom-toting Angelenos on a mediagenic cleanup after the violence had subsided , Cisneros made_up his mind that , like Olmos , he too had to act . &quot; I don ' t know where Eddie got this idea , but it was bril liant , &quot; Cisneros says excitedly , exaggerating the emphasis as he always does when he wants to make an important point . &quot; It was Gandhi-esque . To take a symbol that people would understand , a broom . . . a clean sweep . Because when you ' re cleaning_up , it ' s over , you ' re not tearing_down anymore . It was just bril liant . that ' s when I knew that I would put what I was doing on the back burner. &quot; Cisneros returned to San Antonio and turned_up the heat ; as campaign senior adviser , he immersed himself in Bill_Clinton ' s presidential run . He started_out barely knowing the governor of Arkansas -- they had met on several occasions -- but he became one of the Clinton camp ' s busiest pitchmen . In late October of 1992 , when Clinton ' s victory was a near certainty , Cisneros was asked by Warren Christopher to join the transition team . Christopher told him , &quot; You better think hard , because he ' s going_to ask you to be_on his Cabinet. &quot; Within days , Cisneros was mentioned in news_stories as a likely appointee for either transportation or commerce . Finally , Christopher called to ask what Cisneros wanted . &quot; Warren , I ' ve thought_about this , &quot; Cisneros remembers saying . He ' d just spent a_few days mulling his revelation in L.A. &quot; I don ' t know what the President is thinking . I don ' t know whether he really wants me . But if I were to go_in , I think I ' d like it to be at HUD. &quot; Then things got complicated . Clinton agreed that Cisneros was the man for HUD , but Texas Gov . Ann Richards wanted Cisneros to accept appointment to Lloyd Bentsen ' s Senate seat ( Bentsen had been tapped by the new President for the Treasury_Department ) . Cisneros , in the middle of a political tug of war , spent long days on the phone and torturous nights pondering the choice on_his_own . In the end , he decided against diving back into the political fray headfirst . He declined the offer to be the third Latino senator in U.S. history and instead chose HUD , a comeback path_of_least_resistance . If Richards had appointed him to the Senate , he explained , he would have faced a special election for the seat later in the year , around the time that John Paul was scheduled for open-heart_surgery . His family obligations , he said , came first . John Paul ' s operation was a success , and at about the same time , Cisneros ' political resolve was once again tested . The Senate seat he had turned_down was won by Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Republican . But in 1994 , it would be up for grabs again in the general_election , and three separate private polls taken_in October showed that Cisneros could beat any contender for the Democratic nomination . Hutchison , meanwhile , was in_trouble , facing charges , of which she was later found innocent , that she had used public employees and state-owned computers for campaign purposes . Vice_President Gore reportedly told Cisneros that the opportunity was too good to pass_up . Clinton , nervously eyeing a possible Republican majority in the Senate in 1994 , wasn ' t standing in his way . And once again Ann Richards begged her pal to run_for the seat she had all but gift-wrapped for him . Latino leaders throughout the country urged Cisneros to enter the race , anxious to see one of_their_own elected to the Senate . Even Mary Alice wanted her husband to run . In mid-November , Cisneros said : &quot; I have my own internal calculations as_to how the elections would play_out , and I ' m not the best candidate. &quot; He was concerned about money : $ 5 million was a lot to raise so quickly . And there was concern that Hutchison could be exonerated and politically boosted by her claims that she was the victim of a Democratic vendetta . But Cisneros agreed to meet with his Texas supporters in December . &quot; For a_couple_of days , I listened to friends who laid_out various scenarios . But , &quot; he claims , &quot; I never seriously entertained the notion. &quot; On Dec . 14 , Cisneros announced that he would stick_with HUD . Doug Harlan , the old San Antonio Republican foe , isn ' t surprised that Cisneros did not run_for the Senate . Even as he was winning reelection by landslides , Harlan says , he always acted_as if he were going_to lose . &quot; He ' s a scaredy cat , &quot; Harlan says . &quot; He has very little confidence in his electoral ability. &quot; &quot; I guess it ' s a little too close to all_the bulls- - - with the girl , &quot; admits a Cisneros political ally back in Texas . &quot; He ' s got a beast out there he ' s not dealing with. &quot; Cisneros assiduously avoids responding to such speculation . He says it was political smarts , not cowardice , that made him say no . So what is Cisneros ' political future ? In Texas , there is a deja_vu quality to the talk -- it might as well be the heady ' 80s again . At the December meeting , a 1996 run_for Phil Gramm ' s Senate seat was openly discussed . So was a run_for the governorship in 1998 . But one possibility that used to be_on Cisneros ' list ( although he has publicly denied it ) , reportedly no longer comes_up : the White_House . &quot; Hopefully , someday it will be possible to see a Latino or a Latina become President , &quot; he says for the record . &quot; But I ' m not that person . I don ' t think it ' s something that ' s going_to happen in my lifetime. &quot; His supporters are not so sure . Raul Yzaguirre , president of the National Council of La Raza , says that Cisneros probably has a better chance than any other Latino to land in the White_House . &quot; He needs ratification at the polls , &quot; says Yzaguirre . &quot; He needs it for political reasons and for his own personal self-confidence. &quot; Intellectually , Cisneros acknowledges what a win at the polls means , and he recognizes that every time he runs_away from electoral office , he also runs_away from the big prize . &quot; You don ' t have power when you ' re reporting to one person , even if it ' s the President , &quot; he says , sounding like a man with second_thoughts . &quot; There ' s more power in the people sending me and my being responsible to them. &quot; But the new Cisneros is nothing if not indecisive . He claims not to know if he will remain in politics , much less take another electoral plunge . &quot; I don ' t have a sense of what is the next thing I can do , &quot; he says quickly , as though he ' s been asked the question a_million times . &quot; But I ' m not the slightest bit worried . I ' ve never failed to provide_for my family , and in one fashion or another -- it may be teaching , it might be in business , it might be in_writing , or it might even be in politics -- I will. &quot; WHEN HENRY CISNEROS was a student at Texas A &amp; M in the 1960s , he learned , he says , &quot; the most important lesson in my life. &quot; It started with a guy named Al Tijerina . Cisneros was a freshman , a member of the ROTC Corps of Cadets , and Tijerina , a senior of Mexican descent from San Angelo , Tex. , was one of his unit leaders . He was also Cisneros ' chosen role_model . &quot; All of us , even those who came from the most conservative , segregated , discriminatory backgrounds in Texas , were in_awe_of Al Tijerina , &quot; Cisneros says . &quot; He was seen as the highest you can attain . I remember deciding , ' I can do this . I can do this. ' &quot; And over the course of the next four years , Cisneros did do_it . He rose through the ROTC ranks , won awards , got elected to class office and ultimately headed out of Texas for Harvard , Washington and beyond . But it was what happened at Texas A &amp; M , Cisneros says , that made all_the difference : &quot; I ' ve never had such a clear experience of setting_out to try something very hard and achieving it . I never stopped to wonder what it would have meant for my personality if I had failed. &quot; The meritocracy of ROTC , and the way accomplishment evened the playing_field at Texas A &amp; M , is what sticks_in Cisneros ' mind . &quot; You were promoted , you were rewarded , and you had the respect of your peers , strictly speaking , on three criteria : What are your grades ? What is your performance in the cadet corps ? And what is your performance on the athletic teams ? My ( high_school ) classmates , Mexicanos who were better than me at grades , went_to other universities where they were judged by other criteria : what fraternity you belonged_to , who your father was or how you fit into the hierarchy of the Texas power_structure . They all , it seems to me , came_away with the ( feeling ) that society had put them in their place. &quot; These days , the place Cisneros has chosen for himself may have something in common with the meritocracy he cherished at Texas A &amp; M . As secretary of Housing and Urban Development , he can tell himself that it is substance , not image , that got him there and keeps him there -- to a place where the challenges are specific and success measurable . A place where he can do_well and do_good . &quot; Bill_Clinton gave me a chance I thought I ' d never have , &quot; Cisneros says . &quot; I enjoy what I ' m doing . I feel a real commitment to it . The earthquake bore that out . ( I could have been ) down in Texas campaigning for a Senate_race instead of trying to make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people. &quot; Later , in an unguarded moment , he underlines the point one more time . &quot; Did you ever see the movie ' The Mission ' ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Remember Robert De Niro , when they load him down ? &quot; In the film , De Niro ' s character enacts a brutal penance , carrying a heavy load like a punished pack_animal to a mountaintop Jesuit monastery . &quot; He refuses to let anyone help him , &quot; Cisneros explains . &quot; And only when he gets_to the top can he just completely relax , have peace . He ' s absolved himself . Sometimes that ' s how I feel. &quot;</TEXT>
