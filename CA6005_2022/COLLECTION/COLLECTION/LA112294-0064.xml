   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; MONDALE DIVES INTO TOKYO ' S DIPLOMATIC WATERS ; THE AMBASSADOR FINDS JAPAN ' DYNAMIC , CHALLENGING ' AFTER 1 1 / 2 YEARS ON THE JOB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the mayor of Nagasaki at their side , Walter and Joan Mondale placed a wreath on a stand and looked_up_to a massive statue in Peace Park , dedicated to victims of the atomic_bomb the United States dropped here nearly half a century ago . TV cameras scrutinized their faces , and America ' s ambassador to Japan and his wife knew they should appear solemn . A bright sun shining in their eyes helped . But so did the enormity of the event for which they were symbolically expressing condolences . More_than 74 # 000 Nagasaki residents , Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima said , died in the first four months after the bomb destroyed the city in August , 1945 , three days after an atomic_bomb leveled Hiroshima . Later , Japanese media reported that Mondale said he was shocked by displays at a museum showing the bomb ' s effects . But as the Mondales were_on their way to see a Peace Park sculpture by an artist from Minnesota , the ambassador ' s native state , visiting students recognized the former vice_president . Mondale extended his hand , and the students , squealing with excitement , mobbed him . Soon , others had their cameras out , snapping shots of Mondale with his arms around students . It was a love fest . Such are the emotional roller_coasters of the ambassador to Japan , who insists that he still enjoys his job . There is no question that the man who lost a bid for the presidency in 1984 has plunged into his job with the dedication of an honor student -- reading history , probing how Japan ticks , quizzing Japanese leaders on their ideas for Japan ' s future and going_through 12-hour forays_into the countryside . &quot; I ' m learning a lot I would n ' t learn if I did just another political job , &quot; he said . Under Washington ' s supervision , he is the commander of one of America ' s largest diplomatic outposts , a 600-member embassy that manages work involving 47 # 000 American troops at bases in Japan , cultural , political , scientific and technological dealings and attempts to reduce America ' s $ 60-billion bilateral trade_deficit . &quot; This is the most dynamic , challenging area in the world -- far more so than I think is recognized in the United States , &quot; Mondale said in an interview . &quot; Deep down emotionally , viscerally , &quot; Euro-centered Americans still have not grasped the importance of Asia transforming itself into an economic powerhouse -- a development &quot; that ' s changing the world in the profoundest possible way , &quot; he pointed_out . Americans must have this new fact of life &quot; cranked into our thinking and our psyche &quot; so they can make correct business , political and security judgments , and even &quot; cultural decisions on where we send our kids -- what we teach our kids. &quot; &quot; If I can build our interests here , if I can make Americans more aware of our stake here , I can have some influence on long-term policy , &quot; he said . Mondale indicated that when Washington officials started lambasting Japanese bureaucrats for &quot; sabotaging &quot; still uncompleted negotiations to establish what Washington calls a &quot; framework &quot; for U.S.-Japan economic relations , he stepped_in to tone_down the rhetoric . &quot; You haven ' t seen much of that recently , have you ? &quot; he asked . Japanese bureaucrats , he added , &quot; are very gifted people with a lot of experience . When you get them on your side , they ' re good allies. &quot; In dealing with the Japanese , Mondale said his service as President Jimmy_Carter ' s vice_president enabled him &quot; in ways that might be more difficult for others . . . to speak_for the ( United States ) . &quot; Japanese , he added , &quot; receive me in a very respectful way. &quot; In the difficult area of trade , the ambassador rattled_off a list of agreements that have been reached during his 1 1 / 2 years in Japan -- in construction , rice , cellular_telephones , intellectual property , telecommunications , medical equipment and insurance . Yet , Mondale noted , no progress at all has been achieved on such key issues as opening doors to investment in Japan . Because of interlocking ownership , as much as 70 % of the stock in Japanese corporations is never traded , &quot; making_it almost impossible to come_in and buy a company here. &quot; &quot; This economy , historically , was very insular . . . and ( is ) still insular , &quot; he said . Compared to about $ 700 billion worth of foreign direct investment in Europe and $ 500 billion in the United States , Japan has taken_in $ 12 billion , he said . &quot; Trade follows investment . The fact that we can ' t penetrate this market in terms of_our_own investment affects our ability to trade here , &quot; he said . &quot; For their own long-term health , they need to open this economy up more . . . . Wherever Japan competes with the world , she ' s usually the best or nearly the best -- cars , consumer electronics , that sort of thing . But where she protects herself -- construction , housing , financial services , retailing -- she ' s not impressive . And there ' s a big chunk of this economy that ' s protected and inefficient. &quot; At the moment , &quot; Both countries say we ( won ' t let ) our ( economic ) disputes spill_over into . . . our security relationship . But I don ' t like to test that theory too_much , and I keep telling my Japanese friends , ' Let ' s try to get these issues resolved , ' &quot; Mondale said . Mondale said political reforms here &quot; will help improve bilateral relations. &quot; Already , Japan ' s political_parties have moved toward the center , firming_up support both for the U.S.-Japan alliance and a greater Japanese contribution abroad , he said . Redistricting also &quot; should significantly strengthen the voice of urban consumers , who most favor deregulation and a more open market , &quot; he added . A new dimension entered U.S.-Japan relations with the agreement between Washington and Pyongyang designed to wipe_out suspicions of North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons development -- an agreement Mondale said would have been impossible without Japan . The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the bases that Japan permits U.S. troops to operate here &quot; denied North_Korea a military option . . . ( and ) made_it clear that there was no option available to them other_than to negotiate , &quot; he said . Without the bases here , the United States could not defend South_Korea , he added . With Japan paying $ 4.5 billion to support the U.S. bases , &quot; I think the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty is the best bargain we have in the world . It buys us a better opportunity for stability . It buys us a chance to avoid war , &quot; he said . In addition , Japan has promised to make a &quot; significant contribution &quot; -- second only to South_Korea ' s -- to paying the $ 4-billion cost of providing new light-water nuclear_power reactors to reduce the North ' s ability to extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel , he said . The United States won ' t be paying anything , he added . A new headache for U.S.-Japan relations is likely to come next year , the 50th anniversary of Japan ' s defeat in World_War_II , Mondale said . Noting the uproar already created in both Japan and the United States by a planned Smithsonian Institution exhibit on the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima , he said : &quot; Here we are 50 years away from ( the end of the war ) , and we still have these very deep differences_of_opinion about what actually happened. &quot; Although two recent prime_ministers &quot; made forthcoming statements &quot; facing_up to Japan ' s wartime aggression , &quot; a lot of Japanese leaders take a different position , &quot; he added . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s any way of settling the debate . . . . I ' m hopeful that the 50th anniversary will involve at least two things : one , candid recognition of what happened , followed by a desire by everyone to get_on_with this world and dealing with our problems . . . . After 50 years , we ought to say that ' s enough. &quot; Biography Name : Walter Mondale Title : U.S. ambassador to Japan Age : 66 Personal : Born in Ceylon , Minn. , to a Methodist minister and his wife , a part-time music_teacher .
