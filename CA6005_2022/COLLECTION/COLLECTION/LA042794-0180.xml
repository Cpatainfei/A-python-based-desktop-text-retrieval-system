   <HEADLINE> U.S. CIGARETTE UNIT TO BE SOLD TO BRITISH FIRM ; TOBACCO : PROPOSED $ 1-BILLION SALE OF AMERICAN BRANDS ' DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARY IS SAID TO ILLUSTRATE PRESSURES ON THE INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With opposition to cigarettes growing while the popularity of smoking drops , American Brands on Tuesday agreed to sell its domestic tobacco subsidiary , which makes Lucky Strike and Carlton cigarettes , to BAT Industries of Britain for $ 1 billion . The move by the nation ' s fifth-largest tobacco company to dump its U.S. tobacco holdings follows exploration by the industry ' s giants -- Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco -- of deals that would split their cigarette and food divisions into separate companies . And it comes as government officials propose tougher regulation of tobacco products . &quot; The sale illustrates the changes and the pressures in the U.S. tobacco business , &quot; said Ellen G . Baras , an industry_analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago . &quot; It ' s a shrinking business. &quot; BAT Industries already owns Brown &amp; Williamson , America ' s third-largest tobacco firm and the maker of Kool and Raleigh cigarettes . Analysts said its acquisition of American Brands ' American Tobacco Co . unit -- which must win U.S._government approval -- would strengthen its position in the highly competitive industry . The sale would boost BAT ' s share of the $ 50-billion domestic market to nearly 18 % , according to Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer , a Richmond , Va. , brokerage_firm . Philip Morris claims 42.2 % of the market , while RJR Nabisco has 30.6 % . For American Brands , the sale would give it cash to pump into its diverse and lucrative lineup of consumer products , ranging from Jim Beam whiskey to Swingline staplers and Titleist golf_balls . American Brands , based in Old Greenwich , Conn. , will also retain its Gallaher unit , the largest tobacco company in Britain . Still , the sale distances the company from U.S. investor concerns over the long-term future of tobacco companies . And it rids itself of a unit -- with brands past their heyday -- that has steadily lost ground to larger rivals and whose profit took a beating amid an industry price_war last year , analysts said . Indeed , American Brands reported Tuesday that its first-quarter operating income fell 23.8 % from a year earlier to $ 328.3 million , as earnings from domestic tobacco sales fell 46 % to $ 55.4 million . &quot; Overall , this transaction , when completed , would remove potential uncertainty from American Brands while also fostering competitiveness in the domestic tobacco_industry , &quot; Chairman William J . Alley said . &quot; This is an excellent strategic move for American Brands and its stockholders , a move that would enable us to focus more sharply on businesses with powerful market positions and greater long-term profit growth potential. &quot; On the New York Stock_Exchange , shares of American Brands rose $ 2.875 on Tuesday to close at $ 34.625. BAT ' s American Depositary Receipts gained 56 cents to close at $ 13.75 on the American_Stock_Exchange . Other tobacco stocks also gained_ground Tuesday , with Philip Morris surging $ 2 to $ 54.25 on the NYSE , while RJR Nabisco added 37.5 cents to $ 6.875. * Wall_Street has warmed_up to tobacco stocks in recent weeks as the companies released better-than-expected financial results for this year ' s first_quarter , including improved sales of more expensive and profitable lines of cigarettes . Analysts were divided as_to how the sale of American Tobacco would influence proposals to spin_off the tobacco businesses of RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris . Executives of those firms are said to blame their tobacco businesses for depressing stock prices . On Monday , Philip Morris -- which makes Marlboro , the nation ' s leading cigarette brand -- said its board had considered the_matter last week during an annual strategic planning meeting . But no decision was made , and the proposal remains under_consideration . Last year , RJR Nabisco attempted to spin_off its food group , but canceled the offering in the face of weak demand for food industry stocks . Despite the deal ' s collapse , executives reportedly remain interested in splitting up the company . But those views might be changing as tobacco stocks rise and profits improve , said industry_analyst Roy D . Burry at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co . in New York . The American Tobacco sale &quot; will mean an industry with fewer players , &quot; Burry said . As a result , &quot; you are likely to get more favorable pricing and less price competition. &quot;</TEXT>
