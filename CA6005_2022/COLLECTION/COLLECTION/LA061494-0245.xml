   <HEADLINE> VERDICT ON VALDEZ COULD COST EXXON BILLIONS ; ENVIRONMENT : JURY IN MASSIVE CIVIL SUIT FINDS THAT COMPANY AND TANKER ' S SKIPPER ACTED RECKLESSLY . OIL SPILL WAS WORST IN U.S. HISTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a verdict that could cost Exxon Corp . billions of dollars , a jury found Monday that company executives and the skipper of the Exxon Valdez acted recklessly in the events leading to America ' s worst oil spill . The verdict came_in a massive civil lawsuit brought by some 10 # 000 commercial fishermen , Native_Americans , landowners and others harmed by the 1989 spill in Prince William Sound . The plaintiffs are seeking $ 1.5 billion in actual damages and a punitive award of $ 15 billion -- the amount their lawyers argue is needed to punish Exxon , one of the world ' s largest businesses . &quot; This was the most important part of the trial -- whether Exxon could be ( ordered to pay ) punitive damages , &quot; said Bernard J . Picchi , an oil_industry analyst with Kidder Peabody in New York . &quot; I can ' t imagine that the damages couldn ' t -- on a company this size -- be mind-boggling. &quot; Uncertainty about the potential for monetary damages sent Exxon ' s stock plunging $ 2.50 to $ 59.625 in New York Stock_Exchange trading Monday . Adam E . Sieminski , an oil analyst in the Washington office of NatWest Securities , estimated that concern about the trial has cost Exxon $ 8 billion in market capital since March . &quot; The problem is , what if the jury says the punitive damages amount to $ 15 billion ? &quot; he said . &quot; Even for Exxon , that ' s a big number . That would be a big number for the Treasury Department. &quot; The three-phase trial began May 2 and is expected to last through August . In the initial phase , the jury was asked to decide whether Exxon and Exxon Valdez Capt . Joseph Hazelwood were reckless and should therefore pay punitive damages . The second phase of the trial , to begin next week , will determine the amount of actual damages Exxon must pay . The company has admitted it was responsible_for the accident , but it notes it has already paid some $ 3.5 billion in attempts to clean_up the spill and settle lawsuits with the state and federal_governments . The final phase of the trial will determine the amount of punitive damages . The same jury -- nine women and three men -- will hear the entire case . As the verdict was read Monday , a group of fishermen in the crowded courtroom cheered , drawing a scolding from U.S. District Judge H . Russel Holland . Outside , the plaintiffs ' lead attorney , Brian O ' Neill of Minneapolis , said the decision is proof that &quot; even with a company as big and powerful as Exxon Corp . is , our system brings them to justice. &quot; O ' Neill and other lawyers for the plaintiffs have asserted that Exxon must be punished to deter other companies from placing the environment at risk . * &quot; Nobody wants to cripple Exxon , &quot; O ' Neill said . &quot; We want to change Exxon . We want to make the Exxons of the world aware of the fact that they ' re responsible. &quot; Exxon ' s lead attorney , Patrick Lynch of Los Angeles , said the firm has already been punished enough . &quot; The actions that Exxon took from the day after the spill are exemplary of their citizenship and have obviously been an enormous burden on the corporation , &quot; he said . Testimony in the first civil trial resulting from the disaster has focused so far on whether the spill was merely an accident or the product of recklessness and corporate indifference . The oil-laden Exxon Valdez strayed from shipping lanes and ran_aground on a charted reef , ripping open the hull and spewing nearly 11 million gallons of crude_oil . Much of the evidence centered_on the actions of Hazelwood , who had placed the tanker under the control of a less-experienced officer and was in his cabin when the ship ran_aground . A criminal jury four years ago acquitted Hazelwood of operating the tanker while drunk . Hazelwood did not speak at the criminal trial . But testifying in the civil case , he said last month that he lied to U.S. Coast Guard investigators when he told them he had had only one beer the night of the spill . In fact , he acknowledged , he had at least three double vodkas in the port city of Valdez that afternoon . The plaintiffs tried to show that company officials knew for years that Hazelwood had a serious drinking problem , arguing that the company should never have allowed him to operate tankers . Exxon executives testified that Hazelwood was closely monitored . A turning point in the case may have been the testimony of former Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl , who recanted statements he made to two congressional committees and in the news media after the spill . Rawl testified that he was wrong when he told Congress that Hazelwood was drunk the night of the spill and that Exxon had made a mistake by allowing him to return to driving tankers after he was treated for alcohol_abuse in 1985 . Rawl told the jury the remarks were based on inaccurate information in the frenzied days immediately after the oil spill . Faced with a federal criminal indictment alleging environmental crimes , Exxon agreed in 1990 to pay the government $ 100 million in restitution and $ 150 million in fines . The next year it paid $ 900 million to settle state and federal civil damage claims .
