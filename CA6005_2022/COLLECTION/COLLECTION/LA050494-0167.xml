   <HEADLINE> RABIN , ARAFAT OK ACCORD FOR SIGNING TODAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat locked themselves in a marathon negotiating session in an Egyptian presidential palace , emerging early today with a final accord on Palestinian self-rule . The scheduled signing of that agreement , at a ceremony today to be attended by nearly 2 # 500 dignitaries and senior officials from 54 nations , marks the Palestinian people ' s first_step toward autonomy after almost 27 years of occupation . It is , analysts say , the greatest gesture Israel has made toward peace with its Arab neighbors . On Tuesday , Rabin and Arafat flew to the Egyptian_capital for a last-minute summit as negotiating teams worked furiously at a hotel to draft the final accord , a 200-plus-page document under which a Palestinian Authority will become the new government in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank city of Jericho . Israeli troops , meantime , will launch their first withdrawal from Palestinian territories . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher sat_down with the two leaders under the stewardship of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in a last attempt to reach compromises on fundamental issues that have held_up an agreement : the size of the Palestinian enclave at Jericho and whether a Palestinian border guard will be present on the bridge that marks the international boundary between Jordan and the West_Bank . &quot; I feel quite confident , although there are some issues that remain to be decided , that there will be a signing ceremony tomorrow , &quot; Christopher told reporters before joining the two Middle_East leaders at Cairo ' s Itthadiya Palace . &quot; I ' ll be there to help keep the parties on track , to help them identify the open issues . Of course , this is for the parties to resolve on_their_own . . . . The parties have spent a lot of time with each other. &quot; A senior U.S. official , recalling the breakthrough the two sides made in secret talks in Norway last summer , added : &quot; The Israelis and Palestinians want to do_it themselves , as they did_in Oslo . But they may at the end need a push. &quot; The prodding produced results shortly after 2 this morning , when , after separate and joint meetings with Mubarak and Christopher , the two sides sat_down for a long session that resulted in a final agreement . Its details were not disclosed . Nabil Shaath , the chief Palestinian negotiator , who looked exhausted but elated as he left the palace , announced : &quot; The negotiations are over , and we are going_to write_down what we agreed upon . . . . We ' ve reached agreement on all_the points. &quot; Final drafting was expected to continue through the night , but Shaath said the accord between Arafat and Rabin represented a historic step . &quot; It is the first time in history that the Palestinian people will have their chance to rule themselves on_their_own land , &quot; he said . &quot; This is not all that we want , but it is a beginning. &quot; Discord between the two leaders on several points dragged the discussions out over nearly eight hours . Arafat had been visibly irritated as he left his headquarters in Tunis , Tunisia , accusing the Israelis of backtracking on previous items of accord . Palestinian sources said he was angry at Rabin ' s reluctance to approve the issuance of Palestinian postage_stamps . He was also upset that the Israelis balked at allowing him the Arabic title rais -- meaning either president or chairman -- as head of the new Palestinian Authority . &quot; The Israelis are backtracking . They are procrastinating in_order not to implement many agreements we reached , &quot; Arafat told reporters . Palestinian sources said Maj . Gen . Amnon Shahak , the chief Israeli negotiator , returned from consultations in Israel over the weekend with two_dozen proposed changes to the accord , including the issue of the stamps , prompting rumors that Arafat was refusing to board the plane for Cairo . &quot; The Israelis are retracting on what has been agreed upon . That is why the atmosphere is uncomfortable , &quot; Palestinian negotiator Jamil Tarifi said . Besides the issue of the size of Jericho and the presence of a Palestinian border guard , Rabin and Arafat were seeking to agree finally on the release of thousands more Palestinian prisoners ; Israel has agreed to free 5 # 000 within the first two weeks of the agreement . Israel , in_general , has agreed to free those prisoners who say they will support the peace process . But Palestinians have pushed , as much as possible , to include prisoners from the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas and other opposition groups in a bid to elicit their support once the Palestinian Authority takes power . A draft of the final agreement , obtained earlier Tuesday by The Times , sets_up a schedule of Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho over the next three weeks . A new , 9 # 000-member Palestinian police_force will assume responsibility for &quot; public order and internal security &quot; while Israel maintains its responsibility for protecting international borders and defending against external threats . The agreement says the Palestinian Authority , headed by Arafat , should take &quot; all measures necessary &quot; to prevent crime and terrorism and to prevent hostile acts directed at Israeli settlements and military_installations remaining in Palestinian enclaves . Israel retains the right to return its troops to the Palestinian enclaves in the event of &quot; an outbreak of general hostilities &quot; or in cases where the Palestinian Authority is unable to prevent attacks against Israeli settlements . The draft also establishes terms of a new international presence in Gaza and Jericho , in addition to the 160-member international observer force already agreed on in Hebron in the wake of the Feb . 25 killing there of about 30 Palestinians by a Jewish settler . Describing the framework of the accord over the weekend , Shaath said the agreement will open a vista of possibilities and freedom for Palestinians . &quot; We all must see that the road to peace is being opened , and the Palestinian people will see the fruits immediately . I can say now without any reservation that we have a good agreement , a good agreement for the Palestinians , a good agreement for the Israelis , &quot; he said . &quot; The moment we sign this agreement , the next day and for a week , 6 # 000 Palestinian police will go_in , 5 # 000 prisoners will be released in two groups , people will start seeing Palestinian ports , airports , television_stations , radio_stations , economic institutions , their own electricity , their own telephones , their own government , their own passports . . . . People will start seeing for the first time a real opportunity to develop their own future , &quot; Shaath said . Times research assistant Aly Assem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
