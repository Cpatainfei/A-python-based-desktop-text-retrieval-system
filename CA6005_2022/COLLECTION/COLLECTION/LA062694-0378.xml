   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; SURVIVAL COURSE : ONLY 16 CAN PASS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Colombia does not defeat Switzerland in Palo Alto this afternoon , it will be flying home to Bogota and a very unpleasant welcome from the country ' s soccer fans . Similarly , if Morocco cannot find a way to beat the_Netherlands in Orlando , Fla. , on Wednesday , it will be_on the next flight back to Casablanca . It ' s win-or-be-ousted time in the World Cup as the third series of first-round matches kicks_off . From now on , every game will have something more on the line and every result will have added meaning . By Thursday night , eight of the 24 World Cup teams will have been eliminated -- the six fourth-place finishers and the two teams with the worst records among third-place teams -- and the tournament will be poised to move_into the knockout phase . So far , only three teams -- Brazil , Argentina and Belgium -- have guaranteed themselves a berth in the final 16 . An additional four teams -- Switzerland , the United States , Germany and Sweden -- are all but mathematically certain of a place in the second round . That leaves 17 teams fighting for the remaining nine places , with some in much better position than others . The winners and runners-up in each group advance , along with the four with the best record among third-place teams . The breakdown of who will play whom when and where is impossible to figure_out at this point since the possibilities are numerous . Here , however , is a breakdown of what each team has to accomplish in its third game to survive . ARGENTINA : Already through to the next round , the_Argentines can take_it_easy against the Bulgarians in Dallas on Thursday , perhaps using the game to give some_other players World Cup experience . A tie would be enough to give them first place in Group D , something they might achieve even if they lose . BELGIUM : Saturday ' s victory over the Dutch gives the Belgians a little breathing_room too . They have qualified for the second round and can win Group F with a tie against Saudi_Arabia in Washington on Wednesday . BOLIVIA : The luckless Bolivians will be making an early exit from their first World Cup in 44 years after back-to-back losses . To have even a slight chance of survival , they have to beat Spain in Chicago on Monday , but with their key players suspended , they have little hope of doing that . BRAZIL : The samba beat continues and will grow louder as the tournament progresses . Having already earned a second-round berth , the Brazilians simply will be looking_to fine-tune their engine when they play Sweden in the Pontiac Silverdome on Tuesday . A tie would clinch first place in Group_B . BULGARIA : Beaten by the Nigerians , Bulgaria has a chance to make_it through to the next stage but will have to defeat Greece in Chicago today and hope for a positive result against Argentina in Dallas on Thursday to do so . CAMEROON : The loss to Brazil put a big dent in the African team ' s hopes , but Roger Milla and friends can make_it to the second round with a victory over Russia in Palo Alto on Tuesday . A loss or a tie would mean elimination . COLOMBIA : The biggest disappointment of the tournament has one last chance to salvage something from the wreckage when it plays Switzerland today in Palo Alto . Anything less than victory by a sizable margin will condemn the South_Americans to the scrap heap . GERMANY : Coach Berti Vogts ' squad is poised to win Group C but can only assure itself of that by defeating South_Korea in Dallas on Monday . A tie should be enough to take the group title unless Spain beats Bolivia by more_than two goals in Chicago that same afternoon . GREECE : As World Cup debut appearances go , this one has been a disaster so far . Things do not figure to get any better today against Bulgaria in Chicago or on Thursday against Nigeria in Foxboro , Mass . The Greeks will be_on their way home by Friday . IRELAND : Group E , the so-called &quot; group of death , &quot; could slay any of its four members . The Irish cannot rely_on a tie against Norway at Giants Stadium on Tuesday getting them through . They have to go_for the victory . ITALY : Like Ireland , Italy needs to defeat Mexico in Washington on Tuesday to be certain of staying in the tournament . The group ' s complicated scenario means the score of each game is equally important as the result . In other words , a tie might not be enough to put the Italians through . MEXICO : The Mexicans , as do the other teams in Group E , have a goal difference of zero , meaning they have scored as_many goals as they have yielded . But because Mexico and Ireland have each scored twice compared to Italy ' s and Norway ' s once , they have a slight mathematical advantage . A victory over Italy in Washington would be the best way to resolve the puzzle . MOROCCO : Two games , two losses and a minus-two goal difference has left the Moroccans on the verge of elimination . The Dutch should push them over the edge_in Orlando on Wednesday . The Moroccans must win big , but they don ' t have the guns to do so . NETHERLANDS : The Dutch need to get_at least a point against the Moroccans but will be going_for all three after being shut_out by Belgium on Saturday . A big win and a Belgian loss to Saudi_Arabia on the same day would give Holland the Group F title . NIGERIA : The adventurous and entertaining Nigerians need only a tie_in their final first-round game , against Greece in Foxboro on Thursday , to clinch second place in Group D . A victory , which is more likely , would put them in position to win the group if Argentina falters . NORWAY : The fourth-place team in Group E could become the first-place team by Tuesday night if it defeats Ireland at Giants Stadium . Like Italy , a tie might not be enough to advance . ROMANIA : Which Romanian team shows_up to play the United States this afternoon at the Rose Bowl will determine if Gheorghe Hagi and company finish first , second , third or even fourth in Group_A . Romania defeated Colombia and then fell to Switzerland . Is it time for the tie that would assure both teams of advancing ? RUSSIA : An early flight back to Moscow and a cold reception there , even in the middle of summer , awaits the Russians if they do not defeat Cameroon in Palo Alto on Tuesday . A tie does them no good ; they must win . SAUDI_ARABIA : Boosted by their first World Cup victory , over Morocco on Saturday , the Saudis have a chance to make the second round as one of the third-place teams , even if they lose . A tie against the Belgians in Washington on Wednesday should be good_enough . SOUTH_KOREA : The South_Koreans have played as hard as they know how and still face elimination unless they can somehow score what would be one of the World Cup ' s great upsets by beating Germany in Dallas on Monday . Don ' t hold your breath . A tie , however , is not beyond the realm of possibility . SPAIN : Victory over the Bolivians in Chicago on Monday would guarantee Spain at least second place in Group C and , if Germany is tied by or loses to South_Korea , the Spanish would win the group . A loss would eliminate Spain . SWEDEN : The Swedes ' final first-round game is against Brazil , their opponent in the 1958 World Cup_final . Sweden is virtually certain of qualifying and this will be a test to see just how strong it is . First and second place in Group_B are at stake . SWITZERLAND : A victory over Colombia in Palo Alto this afternoon could give the_Swiss the Group_A title . A tie would clinch second place . A loss would leave the_Swiss no worse than third and probably still second . In other words , there is no pressure on Coach Roy Hodgson ' s team . UNITED STATES : This is it . Today ' s game against Romania could put the United States in the second round for the first time since 1930 . A victory or a tie at the Rose Bowl guarantees that . A loss will not be fatal because of the four points already won . There should be celebrations in Pasadena by 3 p.m. because a third-place team with four points should go_to the next round . Which is where the fun really begins .</TEXT>
