   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; MUD FLIES AS ITALIAN VOTE NEARS ; NO HOLDS ARE BARRED ON WIDE-OPEN CAMPAIGN PRECEDING THIS WEEKEND ' S NATIONAL ELECTIONS . NEW FACES ABOUND AMONG THE CANDIDATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beware the votes of March . Not since Caesar got bushwhacked on his way to the Forum can there have been this much venom in a Roman spring . In scope and snarl , the name-calling and mudslinging are positively imperial . Et tu , Politico ! There are dirty tricks enough to make a gladiator blush . The free-for-all campaign prefaces national elections beginning this weekend that are Italy ' s most traumatic in four decades . They are a break_with a discredited and corrupt &quot; old pals &quot; system , and they chart a new , if uncertain , political future . Ambitious wanna-bes of every political stripe have transformed this opportunity into an unprecedented descent into barbarism , sniffed Indro Montanelli , the conservative , octogenarian dean of Italian journalism , in his new newspaper La Voce . &quot; I urge everyone at this very delicate moment in our national life to avoid acts which may disrupt the electoral campaign , &quot; said Prime_Minister Carlo Ciampi , a technocrat who is not a politician , is not running and was roundly ignored as competing parties climaxed their campaigns Friday night with fresh torrents of invective . Voting Sunday and Monday is for a new 630-seat Chamber of Deputies and a 315-seat Senate , with a coalition of winning parties to form Italy ' s 53rd postwar government . This election is different from all others since World_War_II , because three-quarters of Parliament will be elected not proportionately but directly , in U.S.-style , winner-take-all showdowns . And because Italians are so disgusted with political_parties that have ruled since the war -- all_of them tarred by the nation ' s worst corruption scandal -- they are receptive to new faces . Chief among those is Silvio Berlusconi , a billionaire media baron who has proved in a rookie grab for power that he may be as successful politically as he is commercially -- and that he is as thin-skinned as he is rich . Berlusconi , who is loudly intolerant_of criticism , heads a triumvirate of right-wing parties , including the formerly Fascist National Alliance and the secessionist Northern League . They are bedmates who do not speak . Many voters were still undecided when pollsters unplugged their computers two weeks ago , but on balance , the right was narrowly ahead of an eight-party leftist alliance dominated by the former Communist_Party , now called the Party of the Democratic Left and relaunched as social democratic under Achille Occhetto . Centrists around the scandal-tarnished and renamed Christian Democrats , cornerstones of all 52 postwar governments , were a poor third when the polls stopped in obedience to a new law accompanying electoral reform . Since then , the campaign has generated considerably more heat than light , with issues overwhelmed by accusations . Berlusconi ' s skyrocket political debut at the head of a 4-month-old movement called Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) has attracted concentrated_fire from both the wounded centrists and the leftists who had confidently expected to become their successors in power . Insults fly . Running as a virulent anti-Communist , Berlusconi accuses Occhetto of leading &quot; Stalinist-Leninists . . . who have not cut their ties with their bloody past . . . including Stalin ' s purges , the Spanish Fascist extermination of anarchists , and the genocide of ( Cambodian ) Pol Pot. &quot; Occhetto , a self-proclaimed fan of NATO , conservative economics and President Clinton , calls Berlusconi &quot; arrogant and dangerous. &quot; Times have changed , the Cold_War is over , Occhetto taunted Berlusconi in a speech . &quot; This is not 1948 . People know us . We live_on the same floor as they do . We administer big cities . Nobody believes you any longer. &quot; Berlusconi complains that his companies have had 86 visits from the tax police in the last four months , compared to 10 in the previous 20 years . In the frantic last week of campaigning , the centrist minister of interior , the former Communist head of Parliament ' s anti-Mafia commission and the leftist anti-Mafia mayor of Palermo have all hurled organized crime accusations Berlusconi ' s way . &quot; A chain of lies , &quot; he charged . Sample Candidates The race for Parliament in the tourist-beloved heart of Rome typifies the three-way division of Italy ' s landmark election that begins weekend . On the left : Luigi Spaventa , 60 , affable intellectual , budget minister in the technocrat government of Prime_Minister Carlo Ciampi . Represents Democratic Alliance , a new small movement within eight-party Progressive group lead by former Communists . In the center : Alberto Michelini , 52 , journalist , former TV news anchor . A conservative , represents new reformist party Pact for Italy . Served in Parliament as Christian Democrat before bolting in wake of corruption scandal . On the right : Silvio Berlusconi , 57 , one of Italy ' s richest_men and founder of conservative Forza Italia movement . Owns three national TV_stations , magazines and a newspaper . Favored to win seat , but Spaventi could surprise .</TEXT>
