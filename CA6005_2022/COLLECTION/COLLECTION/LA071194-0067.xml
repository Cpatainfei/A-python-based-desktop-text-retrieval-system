   <HEADLINE> COSMIC RAIN ; JUPITER ENCOUNTERS A STRING OF COMETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The planets of the solar_system do not move through a void . We are surrounded by objects large and small -- comets , asteroids and the debris from their ancient collisions . For the first time , scientists in July will be able to find_out firsthand what happens when a comet slams into a planet . For five days starting July 16 , an unusual stream of 21 comet fragments -- each the size of a mountain -- will slam into Jupiter , offering a unique opportunity to study the kinds of cataclysmic impacts that have scarred the planets and helped shape life on Earth . THE COLLISION Using supercomputers , scientists have developed several scenarios for what might happen when the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hits Jupiter : Meteor_Shower : If the comet continues to fragment as it plows deeper into Jupiter ' s gravitational_field , it could break_into a &quot; flying sand bank &quot; and shower Jupiter ' s upper atmosphere with thousands of tiny meteors . Shock_Wave : In its plunge toward Jupiter , the comet could generate a shock_wave powerful enough to keep the fragments together some distance into the planet ' s dense atmosphere , generating a flash that may be visible to a nearby space_probe . Depth_charge : The shock_wave may help the comet penetrate as deep as 15 miles into the atmosphere , generating a fireball that would fountain back_up through the channel created by the comet ' s passage . Big Bang : In the most spectacular scenario , the comet could penetrate more_than 200 miles into Jupiter ' s atmosphere . The enormous pressure of the atmosphere would help generate an explosion with an energy of 20 million megatons . HOW COLLISIONS MAY HAVE AFFECTED EARTH Lunar rocks brought_back by Apollo astronauts suggest that the Moon is the result of cataclysmic collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized planetoid more_than 4.5 billion years ago . The impact sent a cascade of molten spray into space , scientists theorize . Although most of the debris fell_back to Earth , some of it stayed aloft and formed a Saturn-like ring around the planet , which eventually coalesced into the Moon . END OF THE DINOSAURS The Chicxulub crater -- more_than 110 miles across -- recently discovered in the Yucatan may be the imprint of a mountain-sized comet or asteroid that blindsided Earth 65 million years ago , causing the demise of the dinosaurs and two-thirds of all species then in existence . IN MODERN TIMES In 1908 , a celestial fireball trailing a plume 540 miles long exploded in midair over northern Siberia , leveling more_than 1 # 200 square_miles of forest in what is considered the most devastating impact in recent history . The object responsible_for the &quot; Tunguska Event &quot; could have been a comet , an asteroid , anti-matter , or even a black_hole . No trace was ever found . EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS 1 ) In a nearby nomad camp , the reindeer herd was burned to ashes . 2 ) A herdsman lay unconscious for two days , his entire herd of reindeer killed . 3 ) One nomad later said : &quot; God in his displeasure with us tore the sky apart. &quot; 4 ) In a nomad ' s camp , all_the tents were knocked_down and one elderly man died of shock . 5 ) A hunter ' s shirt was_on fire : &quot; The sky has split apart . When the fire appeared , it became so hot that one couldn ' t stand it. &quot; A Comet ' s Trail Until it was snared by Jupiter , the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 may have been circling the solar_system since creation . The planet ' s immense tidal forces broke the comet into a &quot; string of pearls &quot; more_than 600 # 000 miles long . If this diagram were drawn to scale , the length of the comet ' s orbit would be 5 1 / 2 feet long . Disruption at close approach to Jupiter on July 8 , 1992 Comet discovered March 25 , 1993 Farthest point in orbit -- 31 million miles -- July 16 , 1993 Impacts on Jupiter July 16-22 , 1994 GAILIEO ' S BOX_SEAT NASA ' s Gailileo space_probe might get the only direct view of the impacts on Jupiter ' s far side . It will be about 150 million miles from the planet when the bombardment begins . Galileo was already no its way to Jupiter when the comet was discovered . It is scheduled to begin a two-year orbit of the red_planet in December , 1995 . Evolution of the Brightest Region : These images taken by the Hubble space telescope show the continued fragmentation of some parts of the comet that will decrease the power of its impact into Jupiter ' s atmosphere . Most fragments have apparently been stable for at least a year . Taking Measure : Jupiter is about 300 times larger than the Earth , but rotates three times faster . Pluto : 3 # 672 million miles from sun Neptune : 2 # 795 million miles from sun Uranus : 1 # 787 million miles from sun Saturn : 877 million miles from sun Jupiter : 483.6 million miles from sun Mars : 141.6 million miles from sun Earth : 92.9 million miles from sun Venus : 67.2 million miles from sun Mercury : 35.9 million miles from sun Sources : NASA , Sky &amp; Telescope magazine , Lowell Observatory , Los Alamos National Laboratory , Jet_Propulsion Laboratory .</TEXT>
