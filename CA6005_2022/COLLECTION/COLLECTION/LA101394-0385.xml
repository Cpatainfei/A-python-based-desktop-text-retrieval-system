   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN FIRES MINISTER AFTER RUBLE ' S CRASH ; RUSSIA : PRESIDENT ALSO DEMANDS OUSTER OF CENTRAL_BANK CHIEF . CRISIS HITS_HOME AS PRICES RISE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An angry President Boris N . Yeltsin fired his acting finance_minister Wednesday and demanded that Parliament dump the head of the Central_Bank for failing to prevent this week ' s dramatic plunge of the ruble . As the bank spent another $ 90 million in dwindling reserves to steady the currency in Wednesday ' s trading , lawmakers delayed a vote on Yeltsin ' s demand and decided to couple it with a motion of no confidence in the government . Tuesday ' s debacle , which cost the money_supply more_than a quarter of its value in U.S. dollars , threw Russia into the worst spasm of political and economic uncertainty since Yeltsin eased his pioneer free-market reformers from the government in January . &quot; This is either sabotage or extreme irresponsibility and slovenliness , &quot; Yeltsin told his security_council . &quot; It presents a threat to the security of our state. &quot; He named the head of the former KGB and two other officials to investigate the rush to dump the ruble , which fell Tuesday from 3 # 081 to the dollar to 3 # 926 . It was the ruble ' s worst one-day beating since the Moscow currency market opened in 1992 . The blow hit_home Wednesday as prices rose in kiosks and food stores , especially for imported goods that make_up half of Russia ' s consumer market . Shoppers rushed to purchase dollars or durable goods that can be bartered later . Some merchants reset their prices on the basis of 5 # 000 rubles to the dollar . Economists predicted up_to 30 % monthly inflation . Yeltsin vowed to cushion consumers against &quot; these flagrant miscalculations , &quot; but Economics Minister Alexander N . Shokhin warned against inflationary government spending . &quot; We are walking on the brink of an abyss , &quot; he said . Russia ' s draft 1995 budget , the basis for negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over a $ 6-million standby loan , was thrown into confusion three days before an IMF team ' s arrival . Confidence in the ruble has never been strong enough to sustain it in free trading against the dollar . The Central_Bank has intervened frequently by selling dollars in the market to keep the ruble somewhat overvalued but declining at a rate roughly equal_to Russia ' s inflation . The practice was suspended last month to halt a drain on the bank ' s hard-currency reserves , which have dwindled to less than $ 5 billion . About that time , the bank lowered its lending rates , making currency speculation more profitable . At a Kremlin meeting Friday , Central_Bank President Viktor V . Gerashchenko and Acting Finance_Minister Sergei K . Dubinin shrugged_off &quot; alarming signals &quot; of the ruble ' s weakness and assured Yeltsin there would be &quot; no upheavals , &quot; presidential chief_of_staff Sergei A . Filatov told reporters Wednesday . &quot; They were totally complacent , &quot; Filatov said . Dubinin learned of his ouster from lawmakers after testifying on the ruble ' s fall_in the Duma , the lower house of Parliament . The Duma , to which Gerashchenko is ultimately accountable , put_off a decision on his fate until Oct . 21 . It will also take_up that day a motion of no confidence in Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin ' s government -- the first such showdown since Parliament was elected in December . Testifying in the Duma , Gerashchenko admitted &quot; tactical miscalculations &quot; for the bank ' s belated intervention in Tuesday ' s trading . But he predicted that the ruble , which rebounded Wednesday to 3 # 736 to the dollar , will keep strengthening . To discourage currency speculation , the Central_Bank on Wednesday raised its lending rate back to earlier levels and required commercial_banks to pay upfront in rubles for purchases of dollars ; the earlier rule let them pay within 48 hours .
