   <HEADLINE> KING GETS AWARD OF $ 3.8 MILLION ; TRIAL : THE CITY WILL PAY COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO COVER MEDICAL_EXPENSES AND LOST INCOME FROM 1991 POLICE BEATING . JURY WILL NEXT CONSIDER PUNITIVE AMOUNT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three years after the 1991 beating that made him a national symbol of police brutality , Rodney G . King on Tuesday was awarded more_than $ 3.8 million in damages from the city of Los Angeles . The federal_court jury award , which came_on the fourth day of deliberations , was substantially less than the $ 15 million King ' s lawyers had sought , but well above the $ 800 # 000 the city had offered initially . &quot; I was expecting , and I was hopeful , that Mr. King ' s recovery would be greater than the $ 3.8 million , &quot; said Milton Grimes , King ' s attorney . &quot; But I ' m not dissatisfied. &quot; Mayor Richard Riordan had little comment about the amount , except to say that &quot; the City_Council will now review the jury ' s award and study the city ' s options . &quot; Now that ( the jurors ) have acted , we can hopefully put this chapter behind us , &quot; Riordan added . King was not in the courtroom for the reading of the verdict , although his lawyer said he was &quot; somewhat pleased &quot; with the award . During the trial , King had graphically described the pain and humiliation he felt on the night he was beaten by Los Angeles police_officers in the San Fernando Valley , telling jurors : &quot; I felt_like I had been raped . . . . I felt_like a cow that was waiting to be slaughtered , just like a piece of meat. &quot; The compensatory damages awarded are intended to pay King ' s medical_expenses and lost income -- for which only the city was held liable . In the wake of the verdict , some questioned whether the award had been too_large . &quot; I don ' t think Rodney King ' s injuries are worth $ 3.8 million . I don ' t think Rodney King is worth $ 3.8 million in terms of his ability to make that much money in his lifetime , &quot; said former Police_Chief Daryl F . Gates , who resigned under pressure after 1992 riots that followed not_guilty verdicts in the first trial of four officers accused in the beating . Councilman Hal Bernson , who represents the San Fernando Valley , said : &quot; Here ' s somebody who was fleeing the law . . . . I would n ' t have voted a nickel for him. &quot; But several council_members said they doubt the city will appeal the case , and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , chairman of the City_Council ' s Finance and Revenue Committee , who two years ago blocked efforts to settle the case for $ 5.9 million , said he was frankly relieved that the jury had not been more generous . &quot; All in all , while I would have preferred a lower verdict , I think , to be candid with you , I was fearing a much higher verdict , &quot; Yaroslavsky said . &quot; Any time you go_to a jury . . . you ' re rolling the dice with the taxpayers ' money . We could never have settled this case at $ 3.8 million. &quot; Yaroslavsky said King ' s attorneys had been unwilling to settle for that amount . But with court costs and punitive damages yet to be determined , the city could end_up paying substantially more . Meanwhile , legal scholars and civil_rights advocates hailed the award -- which for reasons that remain unclear was made in the exact amount of $ 3 # 816 , 535.45. &quot; I think it ' s a verdict well within reason , &quot; said Loyola University law professor and former federal prosecutor Laurie L . Levinson . &quot; It sounds like what the jury did -- because the number was down to the penny -- was calculated very specifically ( as ) the actual damages suffered by King. &quot; Joseph Duff , president of the Los Angeles branch of the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , added : &quot; It shows the jury has rejected the argument that King is not permanently injured and accurately and compassionately reflects the pain and suffering from the beating itself. &quot; The awarding of the compensatory damages in King ' s case ends the first of two phases of the civil trial . In the second , which will begin Thursday , the jury is to determine punitive damages and try to assign blame to individual defendants . There is no way of knowing how much money -- if any -- the jury will award in this phase , which is aimed at punishing individuals who contributed to the violation of King ' s civil_rights . Lawyers for King told U.S. District Judge John G . Davies that they plan to call 31 witnesses during the punitive damages phase , and defense_attorneys estimate that they will put 45 people on the stand . Fourteen individual defendants have been named , including Gates and the four former Los Angeles police_officers originally charged in King ' s case -- Stacey C . Koon , Laurence M . Powell , Timothy E . Wind and Theodore J . Briseno . All are current or former city employees , and on Tuesday , City_Council members expressed concern about whether taxpayers should pick_up the tab if damages are assessed against the individual officers . &quot; Punitive damages may end_up being substantial , &quot; Councilman Nate Holden said . &quot; I ' m not prepared to say I ' m going_to cut a guy loose and let him lose everything . . . . As a practice , the city has always indemnified employees. &quot; However , Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said it would teach a lesson to rogue officers if the city forced them to take financial responsibility for their misdeeds . Officers , he said , should &quot; bear responsibility for their own behavior rather than passing it on against taxpayers. &quot; The civil trial is the third court proceeding since the March 3 , 1991 , beating was caught_on videotape and broadcast on television , setting the stage for the worst urban riots in a century . The first trial , a state criminal proceeding against the four officers charged in the case , ended with not_guilty verdicts on all but one count -- in which a mistrial was declared -- in April , 1992 . The verdicts , returned by a Simi Valley jury , touched_off rioting that lasted three days and left at least 52 people dead in Los Angeles . A year later , a federal civil_rights trial of the same officers resulted in the convictions of two of them . Koon and Powell are serving 30-month sentences for violating King ' s civil_rights . In 1994 , for the third April in as_many years , the case was before a jury again , with a new set of jurors asked to place a dollar value on King ' s injuries , pain , suffering and loss of employment potential . In closing arguments , his lawyers argued for the $ 15 million ; the city argued that $ 800 # 000 was a fairer amount . But earlier , King had offered to settle for $ 9.6 million . Negotiations stalled after the city countered that offer with $ 1.25 million . Throughout the three-week trial , the city has admitted liability , but its lawyers and medical experts sought to downplay King ' s injuries and any permanent impairment or brain damage they might have caused . Meanwhile , the city emphasized King ' s troubled past , eliciting testimony about a robbery_conviction , his use of alcohol and drugs and his involvement with a transvestite prostitute . King ' s lawyers , meanwhile , portrayed him as the victim of a racist police_force , a man who was brutally beaten for no reason other_than that he was black . In fact , during King ' s testimony -- the most graphic account yet from the 29-year-old man -- he told the jury that he could hear the police chanting racial epithets as they kicked him and struck him with their batons . The question of whether racial epithets were uttered has been hotly disputed . Shortly after his arrest in 1991 , King said he did not believe that the beating was racially motivated . Later , however , he said he had heard officers make racially derogatory remarks , and blamed his inconsistency on memory_loss . King testified that on the night of the beating , he had been celebrating with friends . Having been recently released from prison , where he had served time for robbery , King said he was feeling proud that night because he had managed to win_back his job with a construction company . But he had too_much to drink , he told the jury , and when he saw police in his rearview_mirror , he panicked . He was afraid , he said , that he would be sent_back to prison and decided to make a run_for it . Although police had testified that King led officers on a long , high-speed car chase , King said that he tried to elude officers only for about 12 blocks before deciding it made little sense to run . King said that after stopping , he did not resist and tried to comply with officers ' commands , adding that he did not strike_out or attack the officers who beat him , acting only in self-defense . Eventually , he said , he followed orders to lie_down on the pavement , but when he did , an officer struck him with his baton . &quot; I felt_like I had lost half my face , &quot; he said , but he told the officer that he &quot; felt fine &quot; because he &quot; didn ' t want to give him the satisfaction of knowing that it really hurt. &quot; The beating -- which police defended by noting that , in their eyes , King was a violent , defiant suspect who had not been searched for a weapon -- was captured on videotape by a resident of an apartment_building across the street . Excerpts were aired around the world , serving as a flash_point for racial tensions as the grainy image of the cowering King was shown to billions of viewers . &quot; I could hear my bones crunching every time the baton hit me , &quot; King testified . &quot; It sounded like throwing an egg and hearing the shell crack . . . . I was just so scared . I felt_like I was going_to die. &quot; King ' s medical experts said his injuries have left him with permanent brain damage , chronic headaches and an inability to focus his thoughts or concentrate . Meanwhile , his lawyers said , his notoriety has made him fearful and so paranoid that he wears a bulletproof_vest on the rare occasions when he ventures out_in public . It is unclear how much of the jury award King will end_up keeping . Although he is expected to retain the bulk of the money , one of his former lawyers , Steven Lerman , has a lien against his judgment for $ 780 # 000 worth of unpaid legal services . Moreover , King has nine attorneys on his current legal team , none of whom have been paid . Grimes , who took_over the case when Lerman was fired in 1992 , also has been lending King an estimated $ 5 # 000 to $ 10 # 000 a month to help him meet his living expenses during the court proceedings . King will almost certainly be expected to repay those expenses from his award . The legal_fees , however , will not necessarily come_out of King ' s pocket . In police brutality cases , attorneys may apply to the judge at the trial ' s end to have defendants pay fees and court costs . That means the city of Los Angeles may eventually have to pay King ' s lawyers , in addition to King . Times staff writers Bettina Boxall , Edward J . Boyer , Richard Simon and John Hurst contributed to this story .
