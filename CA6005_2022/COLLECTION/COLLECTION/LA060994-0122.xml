   <HEADLINE> TOPICS ; FILM ; AN ITALIAN TRAGEDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italy beckoned German filmmaker Margarethe von Trotta six years ago . Known abroad for her intense dramas that focus_on passionate , complex women ( &quot; Marianne and Juliane &quot; in 1981 , &quot; Rosa Luxemburg &quot; in 1986 ) , she has made three films in Italy since moving permanently to Rome . Her most recent film , &quot; The Long Silence , &quot; is a contemporary story of political corruption in Italy and centers_on a woman gynecologist ( Carla Gravina ) who is married to a prosecutor ( Jacques Perrin ) investigating Mafia ties to government officials . Living with death threats and a horde of bodyguards , their lives are physically and emotionally restricted . The suspenseful film , released last year , lays bare the tragic price Italian society -- especially honest individuals and their families -- has paid_for trying to stop the corruption . Von Trotta is well-known in Italy . Yet the film , which is in Italian , received virtually no distribution there after an initial screening in Palermo , Sicily , in March , 1993 , said Felice Laudadio , &quot; The Long Silence &quot; writer-producer with whom she lives . Most of the 30 theaters that had booked the film canceled plans to show it after that screening . The filmmakers suspect that some people , probably the Mafia , pressured theater owners to not show the film . It ran in Rome , Milan and five other cities for only a_few days before it was shut_down . &quot; People wanted to see this film , &quot; Laudadio said . &quot; It was sort of a very strange boycott then , &quot; von Trotta said in a recent telephone_interview from Rome . &quot; The Long Silence &quot; comes_to Los Angeles as part of the Human_Rights Watch International Film Festival that starts Friday night at the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles . It will also be shown June 16 . Von Trotta and Laudadio were motivated to make the film after the 1992 murders of the two leading Mafia prosecutors , Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino . Von Trotta and Laudadio recalled the furor and desperation Italians felt at that time . &quot; Everybody asked himself , ' What can we do ? What could be an immediate answer ? To say ' No , it can ' t go_on like this ? ' &quot; Laudadio said . &quot; ' We have the cinema , so let ' s do something out of it , ' &quot; Von Trotta said . &quot; On one hand , yes , I am still German , living here . I ' m in a way an outsider . But on the other hand , when I saw both these killings , the consequences , I cried like every Italian cried. &quot; Von Trotta went_to Palermo and met with several widows of prosecutors . Because these women were familiar_with her film , &quot; Marianne and Juliane &quot; -- about sisters , one who works within the system , the other a terrorist -- &quot; They already knew that I didn ' t want to use them just to make a spectacle out of their lives , &quot; she said . &quot; I was interested in their way of feeling , also in their way of thinking and living after the deaths . They were very helpful . &quot; Only after this meeting I thought , ' I have to do the film , also for these women. ' It ' s a political film and it ' s a film which is dealing with a certain moment in Italy , but it tells the story from the woman ' s point_of_view , from her life , her fear , her love for this man. &quot; And how she goes_on after his death . Last year ' s screening in Palermo was organized with a Sicilian women ' s association established to counteract the Mafia . &quot; That was a screening in front of 1 # 000 people , &quot; von Trotta said . &quot; There were some judges and ( prosecutors ) with their bodyguards and there were some very angry people . There was a big tension. &quot; After the screening , von Trotta and actress Gravina joined a group of widows to discuss the film with the audience . During that exchange , a woman stood_up and told the audience , &quot; You all know who killed my husband and you never will say it , &quot; von Trotta said . At the Palm Springs Film Festival , Laudadio had told a &quot; Long Silence &quot; audience this woman also declared that the suspected killers were in the theater . &quot; It was a very strong moment , &quot; von Trotta said . Von Trotta also remembered a man in_attendance who described the film as &quot; the first really anti-Mafia film because I ' m not using all this blood and spectacular things , which then makes a pleasure out of the film , like all these war films , &quot; she said . &quot; I just tried to show the consequences toward the people inside , which is much crueler than to only ( show ) dead_bodies or blood . &quot; All the Mafia films , where you always see people running_around with guns and shooting -- it ' s a genre in a way . I tried to kill the genre , or to go_in another way . It comes from inside , the tension. &quot; In the end , the film is a call_for people &quot; not to always be the victims , &quot; Von Trotta said . For now , Von Trotta has returned to her German roots , spending the last year in Berlin to make a love_story set_in the Berlin Wall era . Tentatively titled &quot; The Years of the Wall , &quot; it begins with the construction of the wall and ends the first night of its dismantling , Nov . 9 , 1989 . It is expected to debut in Italy at the Venice Film Festival in September . &quot; The Long Silence &quot; screens Friday at 9:30 p.m. and June 16 at 9 p.m. at the Nuart Theater , 11272 Santa Monica Blvd. , West Los Angeles .
