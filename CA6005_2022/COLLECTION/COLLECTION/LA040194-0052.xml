   <HEADLINE> A CALL TO COLORS ; FLOWERS ADD DRAMA TO A GARDEN . BUT EXPERTS SAY TO START WITH A PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nothing gladdens the heart like flowers : rustling roses and iris standing bloom-to-bloom along a path , around a pool , beside a sunny kitchen door . Freshly cut , they fill a dining_room with fragrance . Set_in pots , they accent entryways and places to sit . In the landscape , whether scattered among shrubs or bedded out_in blazing color blocks , flowers help define garden space , adding texture and life to the green world outside . Throughout the San Fernando Valley , spring borders already are bursting . But it ' s not too late to get a flower_garden growing . In fact , according to Michael Wayt , a Tarzana landscape contractor and designer , the cool evenings , sunny days and moist soil of April are ideal for planting . Still , he and other experts warn that before heading for the nursery , garden-makers should ask themselves a_few questions . For example , Wayt says , &quot; How large an area do you plan to plant ? Is it in sun or shade ? What ' s in the background ? Do you want to cut the flowers or enjoy them outside ? How much time will you spend maintaining them ? &quot; Choosing a certain look_for a landscape is another decision best made in_advance , adds Ted Howard , a self-described garden artist from West Los Angeles who specializes in showy flower beds for a Valley-based clientele . &quot; It ' s important to start with an idea , &quot; says Howard : a picture from a book , a color palette , a particular image from a neighbor ' s garden . He cautions , however , that gardens shown in magazines or books might grow in other areas of the country , where conditions -- and plant choices -- are different from ours . And even in local nurseries the plant selection varies , depending_on the time_of_year . &quot; Putting flowers together isn ' t like building a brick wall , &quot; Howard maintains . &quot; There are many factors . You need to be flexible -- and understand what plants are and what they need. &quot; Sandy Kennedy , a Woodland Hills landscape designer and contractor , advises fledgling green_thumbs to take their ideas -- and their list of garden conditions -- to a small , well-run retail nursery and ask_for advice on plant choices , soil amendments and design layout . In her view , just as critical as buying the right plants for a site is creating a good medium to grow them in . Amending the beds , she says , is &quot; vitally important , especially since our Valley soils run from sandy loam to heavy clay to rock. &quot; To avoid correcting for the wrong problem , she suggests taking a bag of the garden ' s soil to a nursery for assessment . In general , she adds , &quot; a rule_of_thumb for the mixed-color border is to blend about half of the recommended soil amendment with the existing dirt and dig or rototill the bed to a depth of six to eight inches. &quot; She also endorses the use of a pre-planting organic_fertilizer to ensure fast , full growth and vigorous blooming . Inevitably , when designing a plot around blooms , the question arises whether to focus_on perennials , which remain in the garden year-round but are often winter-dormant , or annuals , which flower zestfully , need frequent attention and live only a season or two . Wayt and Kennedy advocate mixing them up , using perennials to structure a layout and annuals for accent color . &quot; Most of my clients prefer perennials , &quot; reports Kennedy , &quot; which reflects a trend I ' ve seen over the past 10 years . But they appreciate the annuals ' extra little punch. &quot; Like Kennedy , Wayt also blends popular ornamental grasses -- which work well in cut-flower arrangements -- and even edible greens into his mixed borders . &quot; Vegetables , &quot; he says , &quot; provide texture and color ; they ' re good filler plants -- and you can eat them ! &quot; On the other side of the annual-perennial debate are people who dislike the appearance of a quiet garden and want lush color throughout the year . Most of Howard ' s clients tend to fall_in this camp , and for them he does twice-yearly &quot; clean-slate &quot; plantings using a potpourri of the season ' s annuals . Contrary to the neat marigold and pansy squares one might expect from this approach , Howard ' s creations have , in his words , &quot; a wild , English-type look &quot; that ' s more common in mixed borders . One reason , he explains , is that he enjoys working with plants of different heights , pairing knee-high dwarf cosmos , for example , with bushy sages and low-lying petunias . This gives his landscapes a certain layered depth of field . Wayt , who uses the same approach , describes a simple guideline for success : &quot; Read plant tags to find_out how tall things will grow . Then plant taller ones in back , medium in the middle , and small in front. &quot; Varying leaf textures adds further interest to a garden . So does planting a small tree -- say a crape_myrtle , weeping birch or evergreen pear -- on the periphery of an especially sunny area . In this way , says Kennedy , &quot; you create a bit of welcome shade , though not enough to keep your flowers from blooming. &quot; Color , of course , is always an important consideration when designing a floral show . While it tends to be a matter of personal preference , experts see a persistent trend toward softer hues -- pinks , lavenders , grays , blues and whites -- and away from yellows , oranges and reds . Kennedy points_out , however , that bright hues work well as accents and can prevent a pastel garden from looking washed_out . With visions of lacy foliage and extravagant color_in mind , it ' s easy for the novice garden-maker to overlook the question of maintenance , particularly when wandering through the spring displays at a nursery . Make no mistake about it , though , flower beds take a lot of work . They require constant dead-heading ( removal of spent blooms to encourage more flowering ) , periodic trimming and regular fertilizing -- a once-a-month job during the warm season . They also need spot hand-watering if thirsty annuals are tucked_in among more drought-tolerant perennials . &quot; The more dramatic the flower_garden , the higher the maintenance will be , &quot; Howard concedes . &quot; Still , &quot; he says , &quot; it ' s not that great a time commitment unless you let it pile_up . Be consistent . Pay_attention to the details. &quot; Kennedy points_out that knowing the growth habits of plants and leaving them plenty of room to spread will reduce the need for foliage cut-backs . And she and others agree that starting small -- with just a_few plants in a limited area -- is a good way for gardeners to learn just how much labor they can handle . &quot; There ' s no rule that says flowers have to be in the ground , &quot; Wayt declares . &quot; Barrels , clay pots , wood containers , even wheelbarrows make terrific little gardens -- great for beginners. &quot; Everyone , he concludes , from beginners to experts , can enjoy what he calls &quot; the best part of growing flowers &quot; -- cutting a bunch for a friend . &quot; It ' s so nice to hand someone a bouquet and say , ' These are from my garden. ' &quot; Matter of Choice As daunting as it is to face the wealth of glorious flora in the nurseries , a_few words from the wise can simplify the picture . First , experts agree , it ' s smart to look within be fore you look_for plants . Recognizing your time limitations , design ambitions , garden-use patterns and attitude about watering_can go_a_long_way toward determining the right plant palette . Most appealing_to weekend gardeners may be relatively bulletproof plants -- those that thrive and bloom without too_much attention . For them , landscape contractor Michael Wayt suggests marguerite and Shasta_daisies , marigolds , sweet_alyssum , gazanias , assorted ice_plants and lantana -- &quot; an incredible , underrated , drought-tolerant ground cover. &quot; Designer Ted Howard recommends a new perennial petunia , named &quot; Supertunia , &quot; that is reported to be an abundant year-round bloomer . Landscape contractor Sandy Kennedy cites &quot; the whole family of geraniums , &quot; and also favors &quot; tough perennials &quot; such_as westringia and statice . * As to plants that produce good cutting flowers , Kennedy lists roses , coreopsis , yarrow , zinnias , cosmos , asters and lilies . In local gardens , David Austen roses are especially popular now for their profuse , highly scented flowers , she says . For hobbyists who relish novelty , her favorite new perennials are white Mexican primroses , rosy-pink Santa Barbara daisies and white mandevilla . Among new annuals , she picks seashell-white cosmos and the taller , free-standing St . Thomas stock . Wayt , who appreciates the look of ornamental grasses mixed with flowers , suggests three kinds that grow well in Southern California : blue fescue , a low , clumping ground_cover or edging plant ; carex , which can be drought-tolerant , thirsty , sun-loving or shade-tolerant , and miscanthus , a tall , dramatic grass that ' s suitable for flower_arrangements . In Wayt ' s opinion , no spring plant list is complete without hollyhocks and sweet_peas . &quot; Everyone ' s grandmother had them , &quot; he said . &quot; When you see them on the back fence by the vegetable_garden , there ' s always some great childhood memory in your mind. &quot; Tools of the Trade Ask Ted Howard , veteran designer and connoisseur of flower_gardens , for a list of indispensable gardening tools and his reply is short_and_sweet : &quot; Good soil . I don ' t care if you use a fork , a spade , a specific food or a reference_book . Your best_friend is conditioned soil. &quot; Landscape contractor Michael Wayt shares Howard ' s affection for fine dirt -- amended with plenty of compost and other organic matter -- but he also advocates particular implements for digging it . He likes a long-handled , V-shaped hoe , called a &quot; Warren hoe , &quot; which eases cultivation , weed pulling and earth turning . Also tough on weeds but gentle on the gardener is his favorite &quot; push-pull weeder , &quot; which can be used without bending over . A good steel bow rake is essential for soil preparation , he says , while supple gloves and the right pruning shears come_in_handy for dead-heading and trimming plants . On the subject of pruning shears , landscape designer Sandy Kennedy favors a lightweight aluminum model with curved blades for maximum control . For larger branches , she recommends an eight-inch folding saw that fits easily in a back pocket . In her view , a small , pointed shovel -- long-handled and lightweight -- is another must-have for planting and maintenance , and she adds that , with tools , &quot; you get what you pay_for . More expensive is better. &quot; All three designers agree on one indispensable reference_book : Sunset ' s &quot; Western Garden Book. &quot; ( The 1994 edition is available in paperback for $ 19.99 in most bookstores and nurseries. )</TEXT>
