   <HEADLINE> WILSON OKS WORKPLACE SMOKING BAN ; TOBACCO : LAW COVERING OFFICES AND RESTAURANTS WILL TAKE_EFFECT JAN . 1 UNLESS VOTERS APPROVE INDUSTRY- SPONSORED PROP . 188 . GOVERNOR SAYS HE IS OPPOSED TO THE INITIATIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson , declaring that tobacco smoke is toxic pollution , signed a sweeping statewide smoking prohibition Thursday , and announced that he opposes a November ballot initiative that would repeal the tough new ban . &quot; We ' re taking an action that is good for everyone ' s health , &quot; said Wilson , who signed the bill at his San Francisco office , and in doing so bucked some political allies . Looking_on were the bill ' s author , Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , and several doctors and others who fought for nearly two years for its passage . The measure bans smoking in most enclosed workplaces , from restaurants and offices to factories and most warehouses . It gives California one of the toughest statewide anti-smoking laws in the nation . The ban will go_into effect Jan . 1 -- unless California voters approve a pro-tobacco industry initiative on the November ballot . That initiative , Proposition 188 , is sponsored by Philip Morris U.S.A. , the nation ' s largest tobacco company . If it passes , the initiative would supersede Friedman ' s bill , and permit smoking in restaurants and most other buildings . After signing Friedman ' s bill , Wilson said he opposes the Philip Morris initiative . Wilson added , however , that he will not spend money to defeat it . &quot; I will say that I am against it , but obviously I have something else that I will be doing , &quot; said Wilson , who is battling Democratic Treasurer Kathleen Brown in a tight reelection race . Describing standards set_forth in the November initiative as &quot; much , much weaker &quot; than those in Friedman ' s bill , Wilson said &quot; the public , left to ( its ) own devices , would support the legislation that I just signed. &quot; Brown also opposes Proposition 188 . In an interview this month , she said she favored the Friedman restrictions . Jack Nicholl , a Los Angeles political consultant heading the campaign against the initiative , hailed Wilson ' s opposition to Proposition 188 as &quot; very important. &quot; &quot; It eliminates this partisan quality , if there was any , &quot; Nicholl said . Lee Stitzenberger , the consultant representing Philip Morris , tried to put the best spin on the governor ' s opposition by saying he was heartened that Wilson would not actively campaign against the initiative . &quot; The fact that a politician is for or against anything in this state is just about meaningless , &quot; Stitzenberger said . Stitzenberger said the campaign in favor of Proposition 188 will revolve_around what he and the initiative ' s sponsor believe is &quot; a reasonable solution to a problem , &quot; by giving business &quot; some degree of choice. &quot; The initiative would let business owners decide whether to permit smoking . Businesses that allow smoking would have to provide ventilation , though standards set_forth in Proposition 188 are not designed to reduce health risks from tobacco smoke . So far , Philip Morris is alone among major tobacco companies in its support of Proposition 188 . Philip Morris spent $ 491 # 000 gathering signatures to place the measure on the ballot . Stitzenberger said he has received no other pledges of money from other tobacco companies . By signing the indoor workplace smoking ban , Wilson went_against some allies , including the California Manufacturer ' s Assn . But the governor said Friedman ' s bill will create &quot; a better environment for California business , &quot; and predicted that it will reduce fire_insurance premiums , workers ' compensation claims , health_care costs , absenteeism and cleaning bills . He said he based his decision on national health studies showing that secondhand smoke results in 53 # 000 premature deaths annually . The ban , he said , will free &quot; California ' s workers from the toxic pollution of secondhand smoke , pollution that no one should be forced to suffer. &quot; Friedman ' s bill is aimed at protecting the health of workers by prohibiting smoking in enclosed workplaces . Violation of the prohibition could result in a $ 100 fine . The measure includes a handful of exemptions , such_as the cabs of trucks , medical research facilities investigating the effects of smoking , and movie sets or theatrical_productions where smoking is part of the script . In a concession to the tourist industry , Friedman agreed to allow hotel owners to permit smoking in most guest rooms , hotel lobbies and banquet facilities so_long as no food is being served . The bill also will permit smoking in bars and card clubs , but directs state health experts to draft safe standards for tobacco smoke exposure by 1997 . If no standards can be developed , or if bar owners cannot comply with them , smoking would be phased_out in bars by the turn_of_the_century . The bill retains a provision allowing cities and counties to impose tougher smoking bans . Several municipalities have restricted smoking in outdoor stadiums , and those local ordinances would remain in_effect .</TEXT>
