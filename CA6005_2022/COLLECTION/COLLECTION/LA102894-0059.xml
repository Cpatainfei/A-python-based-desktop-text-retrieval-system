   <HEADLINE> HUFFINGTON ADMITS FAULT IN HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an emotional confession of wrongdoing , Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington and his wife , Arianna , told reporters at a news_conference Thursday that they violated federal law by employing an illegal immigrant at their home for more_than four years and did not pay the required taxes on her salary for about a year . Huffington said that against his own advice , the couple retained the woman as a nanny for their children because their children had grown so close to her . They said they tried to obtain federal approval for the woman to work in the country legally , but she remained undocumented throughout her employment . Huffington said the woman ' s job ended in the summer of 1993 , more_than six months after Huffington was sworn_in as a freshman congressman and shortly before Huffington announced his challenge to Sen . Dianne Feinstein . The GOP candidate blamed his wife for hiring the woman and said he had not been involved in the decision , but added that he took full responsibility for the action . Although he said he would pay a fine for the violation if he is cited by authorities , he downplayed the seriousness of the infractions . &quot; We have made a mistake , there is no question about it , &quot; he said . &quot; ( But ) who among us has not broken the law ? Who among us has not rolled through a stop sign ? Who among us has not gone_past 55 miles an hour ? . . . We are all human . . . and if we make a mistake . . . we should own up_to it . Which I have done and Arianna has done. &quot; The Immigration and Naturalization Service said Thursday that based on the news_reports , investigators will begin an inquiry to determine whether laws were broken . Officials declined to elaborate on what the scope or focus of the probe would be . It is a violation of federal law to hire an illegal immigrant . &quot; The only information we have at this point is what we ' ve seen attributed to Mr. Huffington in the news media , &quot; said Virginia Kice , spokeswoman for the INS western regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel . &quot; Based on that , we are going_to look_into the matter. &quot; Political experts said the revelation comes at a crucial time in the Senate_race . Huffington ' s campaign , locked_in a close race with Feinstein less than two weeks before Election_Day , scrambled Thursday to assess the political damage after the report in Thursday ' s editions of The Times , which was picked_up widely on radio and television . The candidate canceled a morning event in Los Angeles , and staff_members huddled at the Orange County campaign headquarters without making statements to the media . About 2 p.m. , the campaign alerted the media to a news_conference in Santa Barbara to &quot; set the record straight. &quot; The location and timing limited media access from Los Angeles and San Francisco because of travel_time and avoided network news broadcasts on the East Coast . Still , a bank of reporters and cameras faced the confident-looking candidate and his tentative wife seated at a table . The couple was peppered with questions about the employee , whom Arianna Huffington identified by the name Marisela . The candidate also was asked to reconcile his tough stand against illegal immigration -- including support for Proposition 187 , which would deny education and non-emergency health_care to illegal immigrants -- and how he could employ an illegal immigrant when he wanted others to leave the country . In response , Huffington seemed to soften his tough talk on Proposition 187 and other immigration questions . Instead of seeking the ouster of illegal immigrants in the country , Huffington said , his support of the measure was primarily aimed at_easing a financial burden on the state . At one point he seemed to say that he thought there was nothing wrong with employing illegal immigrants , as long as state tax money is not involved . &quot; If there are illegal immigrants here who are using taxpayer-paid services . . . that is not appropriate , &quot; he said , adding that he also supported more guards to enforce the border . &quot; Neither of those things had to do with our employment of this individual . &quot; I have never said that we should go from house to house . . . and find household help that has come_into the country illegally and send them back to their country , &quot; he added . &quot; I have said , though , anyone using state services such_as welfare or education or health_care , if they are being paid_for by the state , not by private citizens , but by the state , that ' s an inappropriate use of funds . And that is one reason I said I would vote for 187. &quot; Among the other disclosures during the 30-minute briefing were : * Huffington said his wife did not know the citizenship status of the employee when she was hired . But since 1986 , federal law has required that employers ask_for proof of citizenship and record the evidence in a document known as an I-9 form . The form is required to be kept and offered for inspection if requested by immigration officials . Failure to maintain the form is a violation of federal law . Huffington said he did not know what an I-9 form was . * Arianna Huffington said the employee was hired in May , 1989 , about the time of the birth of the couple ' s first daughter . She said she did not begin paying taxes on the woman ' s salary until June , 1990 . &quot; I have not paid the taxes from ' 89 to 1990 , &quot; she said . * Asked why she waited more_than a year before seeking federal documents to allow the woman in the country legally , Arianna Huffington said she was waiting for the outcome of an immigration bill in Congress that might have granted the woman amnesty . &quot; During that time , the immigration bill was going_through the House of Representatives , &quot; she said . &quot; We did not quite know what would happen , whether she was somebody who might be given amnesty in November , 1990 . After the bill was signed , I started the process of labor certification. &quot; But several experts questioned by The Times said there was no amnesty law considered in 1990 . &quot; There was absolutely no new amnesty , and if that ' s her excuse , she better rethink it quickly , &quot; said Peter A . Schey , who heads the Los Angeles-based Center for Human_Rights and Constitutional Law . * To acquire a labor certificate for a foreign resident , federal law requires that the employer prove that no U.S. citizen is capable of doing the job . The Huffingtons said they paid the worker $ 35 # 000 a year , and they were asked why they could not find a U.S. employee at that wage . In response , Huffington asked the reporter if he had any children . Then he described the interview of a nanny as one of the most important of a lifetime . Huffington , however , did not mention that he was living_in Texas and working_at his family ' s company while his wife did the interviews . * Arianna Huffington said the woman worked_at the household full time until the summer of 1993 . Sources told The Times , however , that the employment continued until at least November . One source also told The Times that the woman worked in the home for a period this past spring . Huffington said the woman still visits the children , and they call her regularly . Both Huffington and his wife said their decision was driven by a strong emotional bond between the woman and their daughters . They said their oldest daughter , now 5 , is secretly wishing that her father would lose the Senate_race so she could move from Washington back to Santa Barbara , where her former nanny lives . &quot; I have never found anybody who could replace Marisela , &quot; Arianna Huffington said . &quot; Yes , we could have afforded any child-care provider , but you cannot buy love for your children , and Marisela loves them to this day . If you go_to her home , it is_full of pictures of my children . The only phone_number that my 5-year-old knows by heart is Marisela ' s number . She calls her regularly . She still cannot , to this day , understand why Marisela is not with us. &quot; The candidate said he knew of his children ' s attachment , but he made a mistake in not forcing her to leave the household anyway . Arianna ' s &quot; instinct was kind and it was generous , but according to the law , it was wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; While I was not personally involved in the hiring process , I must take full responsibility . As the head of my household , the buck stops with me . I should have put my foot down , ignored the pleas of my wife and my daughter , and demanded that my wife terminate the woman ' s employment . But I didn ' t . That was my decision , and it was my responsibility. &quot; Since 1986 , federal law has made_it a crime for employers to hire illegal immigrants . President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act_on Nov . 6 , 1986 , requiring that employers verify a worker ' s citizenship status when they are hired by requesting personal documents such_as a U.S. passport , Social_Security card or driver ' s license . The act provides civil penalties of up_to $ 10 # 000 for each illegal immigrant hired . Repeat violators may also be prosecuted criminally and face jail terms . Huffington ' s campaign confirmed Wednesday evening that the household had hired an illegal immigrant to care_for the children after The Times called_for a response to a pending story about the issue .</TEXT>
