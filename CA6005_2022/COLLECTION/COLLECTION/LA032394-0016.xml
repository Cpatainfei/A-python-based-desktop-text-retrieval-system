   <TEXT> &quot; A More Perfect Union &quot; is specifically addressed to heterosexual readers . &quot; Why Straight Americans Must Stand Up for Gay Rights &quot; is the book ' s provocative subtitle , and it is more correctly described as a book about human_rights than &quot; gay rights , &quot; a term the author himself uses . &quot; As an invisible minority , gay_men and lesbians also need civil_rights protections , &quot; argues Richard D . Mohr , &quot; in_order for them to have reasonably guaranteed access to an array of fundamental rights which virtually everyone would agree are supposed to pertain equally to all persons. &quot; Homophobia , Mohr asserts , is merely another expression of the same ugly bias that is sometimes directed at Jews , African Americans or Latinos . And gay bashing is &quot; a form of vigilantism that bears a striking resemblance to the lynching of black men. &quot; Thus defined , gay rights is part of the civil_rights movement in America , a movement that is entitled to the support of blacks , Jews , Latinos and every minority that has known the sting of hatred , violence and discrimination . Mohr , a professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois , gives us an all-embracing manifesto that starts_out as an essay on the philosophical and jurisprudential underpinnings of civil_liberty and quickly escalates into an unrestrained call to arms for gays and straights alike in the name of &quot; gay justice. &quot; Mohr is blunt and unsparing in his arguments in favor of gay rights . While he is hardly an in-your-face activist -- and even though his prose is always courtly and well-considered -- Mohr is not the least bit shy about demanding that gay_men and lesbians be afforded the freedom to pursue their own vision of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . For example , Mohr condemns the closing of gay bathhouses as a prophylactic against the spread of AIDS precisely because , as he puts it , such meeting_places are so important to a sense of community and identity among gay_men . &quot; With some slight exceptions like the gay choral movement , gay political organizations , and . . . . AIDS support groups , sex is the only mode in which gays in current culture are allowed to identify themselves to themselves , &quot; he writes . &quot; Self-respect , such_as it is , for gay_men in our culture is often the product of a robust sex life. &quot; Similarly , Mohr devotes a good_deal of his book to the suggestion that &quot; committed gay relationships &quot; ought to be recognized as legal marriages . He argues that &quot; gay life , like black culture , might even provide models and materials for rethinking and improving family life. &quot; And then he makes the startling proposition that &quot; a commitment to monogamy &quot; is one condition of marriage that is not necessarily an element of gay marriage . The central argument in &quot; A More Perfect Union &quot; is rooted in the constitutional right_of_privacy -- the same concept that is the basis for the right of women to seek an abortion . As Mohr reads the right_to_privacy , it assures all Americans , men and women , gay or straight , the freedom to express themselves through their sexual identity without fear of a law against abortion or a law against sodomy . Even the threat of AIDS , he seems to argue , is no reason to abridge the right of sexual freedom . &quot; If independence -- the permission to guide one ' s life by one ' s own lights to an extent compatible with the_like ability on the part of others -- is , as it is , a major value , one cannot respect that value while preventing people from putting themselves at risk through voluntary associations. &quot; Again and again , Mohr draws intriguing linkages between sexuality and politics . Mohr depicts &quot; coming_out &quot; as not merely a moment of self-discovery and self-revelation , for example , but also an overtly revolutionary gesture . &quot; Far from signaling immorality , &quot; he writes , &quot; coming_out to others affords one of the few remaining opportunities in ever more bureaucratic , technological and socialist societies to manifest courage. &quot; How does the advocacy of gay rights work to the benefit of &quot; straight America &quot; ? Mohr holds_out the bland promise of a better world for all_of us if only we can acknowledge that gay_men and women are entitled to genuine civil_liberties and not merely the back-to-the-closet policy of &quot; Don ' t ask , don ' t tell. &quot; &quot; Society would be richer for acknowledging another aspect of human diversity , &quot; he exhorts . &quot; Families with gay members would develop relations based on truth and trust rather than lies and fear . And the heterosexual majority would be better_off for knowing that they are no longer trampling their gay friends and neighbors. &quot; Still , Mohr does not quite deliver on the straightforward promise of his subtitle -- he tells us why we should stand_up for gay rights , but not why we must do so . To a reader who is not already convinced , the distinction may turn_out to be crucial .</TEXT>
