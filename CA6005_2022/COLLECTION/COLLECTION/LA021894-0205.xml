   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NOT OVER UNTIL . . . ; RESILIENT MICHAEL CARBAJAL RECALLS TOUGHEST FIGHT BEFORE TAKING_ON HUMBERTO GONZALEZ AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was over , no doubt about it . Michael Carbajal , eyes staring nowhere and legs dead , twisted sideways into the ring ropes , then crashed to the canvas . His ponytail was matted to his back , and his left arm swung between the second and third ropes , limply reaching for balance . After four blistering rounds of absorbing Humberto ( Chiquita ) Gonzalez ' s hammering , Carbajal had to be finished 15 seconds into the fifth , and Gonzalez and everybody else watching the fight at the Las Vegas Hilton knew it . &quot; I caught him good , &quot; Gonzalez said , recalling the moment this week through a translator . &quot; I saw he was very , very bad . I believed he would never get up. &quot; At least not before referee Mills Lane counted to 10 , maybe not before 100 . Earlier in this fight on March 13 , 1993 , Carbajal had gone_down for the first time in his career , but after that second-round knockdown he was up quickly and not badly damaged . On this knockdown , caught clean with back-to-back rights as the 5-foot-1 Gonzalez charged him to open the fifth , Carbajal visibly sagged before going_down . &quot; I saw him fall and I thought , man ! &quot; said Carbajal ' s brother and trainer , Danny . How could it not be over ? Then Michael Carbajal emerged from his daze at the count of five , slammed the canvas in anger , rose to his feet and carried the fight into history . The long-awaited rematch is Saturday night at the Forum . &quot; I don ' t think anybody else would ' ve gotten_up from that , &quot; Danny Carbajal said of his brother ' s fifth-round crisis . &quot; All I knew is I had to get_up , &quot; Michael Carbajal said . &quot; No panic . Just , get_up . I was still a little bit shaky . I knew where I was at , but my legs were still wobbly . &quot; But after taking that shot , anything else I took from him there was no problem . I had taken his best. &quot; Carbajal survived Gonzalez ' s frenzied attempt to finish him off -- Gonzalez launched 20 wild home-run swings in the 10 seconds after the knockdown -- and came_back to score with his own whistling right-hand shots in that round as Gonzalez tired . The fight ended two rounds later , when Carbajal delivered a savage right-left hook combination that crumpled Gonzalez forward to the floor . Gonzalez was counted_out , his eyes shut_in agony . Trailing by four points on all judges ' cards as the fight ended , Carbajal leaped and nearly wept in celebration . It was over . &quot; The only thing I will always think , &quot; Gonzalez said softly , &quot; is that I already had him . And that I let him go. &quot; * Nobody had to go_back through the videotape to know that this was one of the best fights in recent years , probably the best ever in the light-flyweight ( 108-pound ) division . The stunned roars of the crowd . The furious hugs among the Carbajal cornermen when it was over . The bleak look_on Gonzalez ' s face when he crawled back to a sitting position and asked his corner : &quot; Did he hit me ? &quot; Almost a year later , both fighters can remember every important moment of that bout -- their thoughts and their fears and their triumphs -- as if they were touchstones of their lives . Heading into the rematch , the two men spoke in separate interviews with similar degrees of pride and eagerness , obviously hungry to go_back into the ring another time . &quot; I have been waiting for this since the day I lost , &quot; Gonzalez said . Carbajal , 25 at the time , entered their first fight with a 27-0 record and the International Boxing Federation light-flyweight belt . But doubts had been gathering over the 1988 Olympic silver medalist from Phoenix -- he had only 15 knockouts in those 27 victories , a low percentage for such a nimble outside puncher , and he had been hit hard often . Gonzalez , 26 then , was considered the Mexican Mike Tyson of the lower weights , a brawler with a frontal attack that chewed_up his opponents . He had the World Boxing Council belt and a 35-1 record , with 25 knockouts . But Gonzalez had always struggled to make weight , was having trouble with his managers right up_to the Carbajal fight , often fought listlessly and was not known as a technician in the ring . He was a bull . Carbajal thought he knew how to handle bulls . &quot; I thought the fight would be easier than it was , &quot; Carbajal said . &quot; When I saw him fight before , he threw really slow and really wide punches. &quot; Said Danny Carbajal : &quot; We had planned just to box and maybe in the later rounds take him out. &quot; It did not happen that way , not for a moment . Gonzalez , who usually works from a southpaw stance , came_out fighting right-handed in the first round and , unsurprisingly , came_out bombing . &quot; The strategy was to attack Carbajal , &quot; said Gonzalez ' s adviser , Rafael Mendoza . &quot; The best thing was to make Carbajal respect him . Don ' t let Carbajal walk ( forward ) . He is very good when he walks . He cannot fight backward. &quot; The first was a tight round , with both fighters landing some punishing shots , though neither was hurt . Carbajal backed_away from some of Gonzalez ' s charges but stayed inside to trade shots more often than his brother liked . &quot; Michael came_back after the first round , and I was trying to tell him , ' Don ' t stay with him right there , give me more movement , ' &quot; Danny Carbajal said . &quot; He told me , ' No , no , no , Danny . He ' s not that strong . I ' m stronger . I want to mess him up inside. ' &quot; Nobody knows better than the fighter inside the ring. &quot; Carbajal kept trying to fire away from tight quarters in the second round , but seemed to be confused when Gonzalez switched back to his southpaw style and began hitting Carbajal with searing combinations to the body and head . About two minutes into the round , Gonzalez caught Carbajal with a solid left uppercut , and 30 seconds later , a wide left to the forehead put Carbajal down . &quot; He was a lot quicker and threw a lot crisper than I thought he would be , &quot; Michael Carbajal said . Carbajal clearly wasn ' t hurt by the knockdown -- he was up at the count of two and fighting again immediately after the eight-count -- but Gonzalez was setting the tempo of the fight . Through the third and fourth rounds , Gonzalez swarmed over Carbajal . Although Carbajal was catching Gonzalez with clean right crosses and those rocket shots had opened_up a gash over Gonzalez ' s left eye in the third , Gonzalez was winning the fight with flurries that often had Carbajal on his heels . The first knockdown told Gonzalez everything he needed to know . &quot; I knew it ' s not going_to be any problem to handle this guy , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; He got_up , he wasn ' t hurt . But , I thought , at the first hard punch I nailed him with , he went_down . &quot; He was going_to be mine at any time. &quot; * The fifth round all but won the fight for Gonzalez , then ultimately lost_it . He had to shed several pounds the day before the bout to make weight , and was not sure he could last 12 rounds at a break-neck pace . His plan was to attack and get a knockout , and nothing Carbajal had done warned him away from the strategy . When the fifth opened , Gonzalez zoomed_in for the kill , pinning Carbajal against the ropes_in five seconds and firing looping rights and lefts at his head . Carbajal tried answering , but couldn ' t get_to Gonzalez , who is four inches shorter . Ten seconds into the Gonzalez flurry , Carbajal was hit by the second right hook , and went_down . His brother , upon later reflection , sees the next five seconds as the most important span of time in his brother ' s professional career . The answer to any man ' s deepest fears . &quot; I don ' t like to see him go_down , but there has to be another fighter who goes_in with the same competitiveness , &quot; Danny Carbajal said . &quot; The same heart to go_out there and test yourself against . With Gonzalez , a lot of the questions about Mike were answered in the fifth round. &quot; Carbajal was_on his knees by the count of five and , with the support of the ropes , on his feet by seven . But his eyes and legs looked as if the fight were over . Gonzalez saw it . &quot; When I saw him get_up , I jumped_on him , and I was trying to finish him , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; I threw a lot of punches and I got tired . &quot; It was a mistake . Because of the problem I had with my weight , I shouldn ' t have gone_after him. &quot; Before the fifth round was a minute old , Carbajal had already gone_down dizzily and gotten_up , and Gonzalez had relaunched his attack and punched himself out . Carbajal , stunningly , had recuperated , fought_off Gonzalez and gone_back to battle . Said Gonzalez ' s new trainer , Ignacio Beristain , who replaced Justo Sanchez : &quot; He threw too many punches to see if he could nail him with one and finish the fight , instead of going very calm and trying to find the opening . &quot; But when you get excited and when you are worried because you don ' t have the conditioning , you say , ' I better finish him now. ' &quot; Carbajal took_over the rest of the round and began to hit Gonzalez with his left hook , which would become the fateful punch of the fight . Into the sixth and seventh rounds , Carbajal seemed to grow fresher and fresher , as Gonzalez ' s carefully plotted combination attack evaporated into pure slugging . Gonzalez was more open than ever . &quot; I knew that Michael could take a shot , &quot; Danny Carbajal said . &quot; And I knew if Michael landed a shot the way Gonzalez did , it was going_to be over. &quot; At 1:32 of the seventh , Carbajal caught Gonzalez off-balance with a short left hook that drove Gonzalez 10 feet back into the ropes . Although it could have been ruled a knockdown , Lane did not call it , and Gonzalez covered_up against Carbajal . &quot; That was the first time Gonzalez had been hurt , &quot; Mendoza said . Gonzalez recovered enough to hit Carbajal a dozen more times , but his legs were gone . His arms swung heavily . Then , with less than 20 seconds left in the round , Carbajal pounded a right_hand into Gonzalez ' s face that pushed him against the ropes , ducked two soft Gonzalez counters , missed with a wild right and connected with a perfect left hook . &quot; That was not only a strong punch , it was a surprise , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; And that was the combination that put me down. &quot; Gonzalez teetered for a second , his body resting briefly on Carbajal ' s shoulder . He fell hard . Though he hit the canvas at 2:47 , Lane did not officially count him out until one second remained in the round . Carbajal will earn $ 1 million Saturday night , as a direct result of his increased stature in the boxing world because of that victory last March . And the comparisons to Roberto Duran , his idol , have never seemed more apt as he prepares_for the rematch . &quot; Michael knows he can take whatever Gonzalez can dish_out , &quot; Danny Carbajal said . &quot; That doesn ' t mean we ' ll go_in reckless , but he knows , ' I can take it. ' Gonzalez has the question , ' Man , if he hits me , am I going_to go_out again ? ' And that he can ' t get_rid_of , no matter how long he fights. &quot; Said Gonzalez : &quot; Carbajal says that because I got tired and I never nailed him again . If I nail him again good , he will go down. &quot; Gonzalez grew quiet when asked if he was injured by the knockout . &quot; I was not hurt , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; I didn ' t have any pain . The only thing I felt was sadness. &quot; Michael Carbajal , asked what the moment was like , also recalled only emotion . &quot; I just remember saying , ' Damn , that was a good fight.
