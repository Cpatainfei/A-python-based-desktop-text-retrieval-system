   <TEXT> In what was probably the world ' s biggest one-day party , millions of Brazilians , starved for 24 years since last winning the World Cup , poured into the nation ' s streets Sunday night , singing , dancing and most of all drinking in celebration of their country ' s victory over Italy . In a nation where football is more religion than sport and heroes take_on mythic proportions , the win takes_on a significance much larger than a mere sports victory . For people who have suffered through one political scandal after another , battled inflation that last year was nearly 3 # 000 % and earn a median income of only $ 300 a month , it is a temporary salve for the ills of a nation . &quot; The victory is an omen of the good things that are going_to come , &quot; teacher Margarite Studart shouted between leaping up and down at a local restaurant where throngs had gathered to watch the game . &quot; I know it . I know it. &quot; &quot; It restores our spirit , &quot; said physician Atila Machado , 54 . &quot; Our spirit has been down -- the economy , politics and the death of ( race_car driver ) Ayrton Senna . You lose someone like Senna and it brings_down the country. &quot; President Itamar Franco has already declared today a holiday for federal workers , and in true Brazilian fashion , other workers are expected to piggyback on the federal decree and stay home , still basking in the glow of victory . So , for one night , the young and old , the rich and poor put aside concerns over the stumbling economy and a divisive upcoming presidential election to embrace each other over the one thing that brings this often fractious nation together -- soccer . Excited fans , most who had been holed_up in their homes nervously watching the game on television , poured into near-empty streets , jamming the famous beaches of Rio de Janeiro and clogging the avenues of the country ' s other urban_centers . &quot; My heart is beating so fast , &quot; said Carlos Olivera , a security_guard standing outside the city ' s posh beachfront apartment_buildings . &quot; I was so nervous during the game , I was shaking . I drank 20 cups of beer to calm_down . But now , let ' s drink ! Let ' s drink ! &quot; In the Girl From Ipanema restaurant , the birthplace of the famous song of the same name , Gloria Regina was in tears , kissing a piece of green-and-gold ribbon she had pulled_down from the rafters . &quot; The only thing that comes_close to this is the birth of my daughter , &quot; she said as the crowd yelled &quot; Champion ! Champion ! &quot; On Rio ' s famous Ipanema , Copacabana and Flamengo beaches , singing and chanting men , women and children danced in glee to the sounds of samba emanating from bands atop huge sound_trucks . In the city ' s Tijuca neighborhood , throngs gathered under a huge canopy of streamers , singing samba songs along with the national_anthem . In Sao Paulo , a city of 17 million , more_than 200 # 000 celebrated on Avenida Paulista under skies filled with brilliant fireworks . In Belo Horizonte , thousands clogged the city square , dancing beneath a 20-foot-tall stage to a large , colorful samba band . In the northeastern resort city of Fortaleza , more_than 20 # 000 people gathered along the shore , dancing into the night . Throughout the nation , cars_raced up and down city arteries , drivers honking their horns while their passengers waved large Brazilian flags from the windows . And everywhere , huge fireworks explosions punctuated the night air . The celebration actually began hours before the game began . Fireworks began early in the afternoon , and an hour before the game , many Brazilians donned green and gold , the country ' s national colors , and headed for restaurants and bars throughout the country . In Rio , on nearly every corner , the salute was &quot; Brasil ! Brasil ! &quot; Some became so excited that they became sick , most due_to high_blood_pressure . Hospitals in Rio reported a 30 % jump in the number of patients coming_to their emergency_room , almost all related to the World Cup .</TEXT>
