   <HEADLINE> DEVIL WINDS ; FLOWING FROM DESERT TO MOUNTAIN TO SEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s the season for Santa Ana winds , and with them comes the reminder of the wildfires last fall that claimed 1 # 241 structures , almost 200 # 000 acres and $ 1 billion in damages . Three people lost their lives . Santa Anas usually occur in autumn and sometimes in winter , knocking_out power , tripping burglar_alarms and whipping_up other bits of mischief . The phenomenon originates hundreds of miles from Southern California in a high-pressure system over Utah and is generally strongest in the Riverside-San Bernardino area . Santa Ana winds move through the mountains from the north-northeast , funneling through the canyones into the basin . The heat of the wind is more the result of its downhill motion than its movement across the desert . This is the path : 1 . Air is cool and holds fair amount of moisture . 2 . Air loses moisture as it moves_up the mountains . 3 . Wind speed increases as air funnels through mountain_passes . 4 . Temperature of the air increases 5.5 degrees for every 1 # 000 feet it descends . 5 . Air that passes_over and through mountains has lost almost all moisture . * Tracing the Name There are many theories as_to why the winds are called Santa Anas . Some believe the name comes from ' Satanas , ' Spanish for Satan . But it is generally accepted that they are named for Santa Ana Canyon , the narrow gap in the Santa Ana Mountains in Orange and Riverside counties , where the winds are especially strong . Contributing Factors Dry cold_fronts passing_through the Great Basin states are followed by a high-pressure system over the Utah-Nevada border , creating westerly winds that eventually become Santa Anas . * &quot; There was a desert wind blowing that night . It was one of those hot , dry Santa Anas that come_down through the mountain_passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch . On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight . Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands ' necks . Anything can happen. &quot; - Raymond Chandler , &quot; Red Wind &quot; * How Other Winds Compare Sustained winds from Santa Anas generally range from 15 m.p.h. or less for a weak system to 35 or 40 m.p.h. for a strong one , although gusts of up_to 90 m.p.h. have been recorded in mountain and canyon passes in San Bernardino County . Here are generally assigned values for sustained wind speeds for other storms : Sandstorm : 30 m.p.h. or more Dust_Storm : 30 m.p.h. or more Tropical depression : 38 m.p.h. or less Tropical storm : 39-78 m.p.h. Gale : 39-54 m.p.h. Severe blizzard : 45 m.p.h. or more Hurricane : 74 m.p.h. or more Sources : National Weather Service , UCLA Atmospheric Science Dept. , Encylopedia Americana , Weather of Southern California Researched by JULIE SHEER / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
