   <HEADLINE> PLAN BLAZES APPALACHIAN TRAIL ' S EXTENSION TO CANADA ; ENVIRONMENT : THE FAMOUS FOOTPATH , WHICH CUTS THROUGH 14 STATES BEFORE ENDING IN NORTHERN MAINE , WOULD CONTINUE INTO NEW BRUNSWICK AND QUEBEC UNDER THE PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A plan to extend the 2 # 150-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine another 250 miles into Canada was unveiled as an Earth Day initiative by former Gov . Joseph E . Brennan . The famous footpath , which cuts_through 14 states before ending at mile-high Katahdin in northern Maine , would continue into New Brunswick and Quebec under the Brennan proposal . The new northern terminus would be at the summit of 4 # 180-foot Mt . Jacques Cartier , which marks the end of the Appalachian range_in the spectacular Chic-Choc mountains of Quebec ' s Gaspe Peninsula . The 250 additional miles would encompass a broad range of terrain , including spruce-fir forests of Maine and New Brunswick and the potato country of northern Maine ' s Aroostook County . Brennan , a former two-term governor who is a gubernatorial candidate this year , met with reporters at his Portland campaign office to outline the trail extension proposal . He said the project , which is not dependent_on his election , would help to strengthen the ties between Maine and its neighbors in Quebec and New Brunswick . &quot; This trail will be a symbol of our new commitment to work together as neighbors , to sustain and enjoy our common environment and to celebrate the grandeur of the landscape that ties us together , &quot; he said . Although he put no price_tag on the project , Brennan noted that the existing trail was a volunteer effort and predicted that the extension would not be costly . Dave Startzell , executive_director of the Appalachian Trail Conference in Harpers Ferry , W.Va. , said he was unaware of Brennan ' s plan but noted that proposals to extend the trail in both directions have surfaced at various times in the past . &quot; The good people of Alabama have pointed_out to us that the natural terminus of the Appalachian mountains is Alabama , not Georgia , &quot; said Startzell , who also cited periodic efforts to have the trail extend into Florida . A group in Quebec , he recalled , had approached him about a year ago with the idea of running a side trail from western Maine ' s Rangeley area through Lac Megantic . Startzell said any decision to extend the trail will be based in large part on the thinking of the conference ' s member clubs that build and maintain its various sections . Nonetheless , he indicated that an extension from either Katahdin or Springer Mountain , Ga. , would not be undertaken lightly . &quot; The two terminuses are_well ingrained in our history . Our articles of incorporation refer to Georgia and Maine . So it would certainly be a leap from our tradition , &quot; he said . Predicting strong Canadian interest in the extension , Brennan read a memorandum of support from Denis Losier , New Brunswick ' s minister of Economic Development and Tourism . &quot; I see this as a tremendous opportunity to link by footpath two countries already linked in so many other ways , &quot; wrote Losier , who noted that New Brunswick is now developing a provincial trail network of its own .</TEXT>
