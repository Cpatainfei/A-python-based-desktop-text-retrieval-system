   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / RUTH ROSEN : THE WAR TO CONTROL THE PAST ; THE RIGHT WANTS TO PORTRAY AMERICA ' S HISTORY WITHOUT THE BLEMISHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lynne Cheney attacks it as a work of &quot; political correctness. &quot; Rush Limbaugh wants to flush_it down the toilet . Pat Buchanan calls it horrendous . What is causing the right_wing to go ballistic ? Is it pornography ? Another controversial artistic exhibit funded by taxpayers ' hard-earned money ? No , it ' s history . A few weeks ago , the National Center for History in the Schools ( funded jointly by UCLA and the National Endowment for the Humanities ) released the standards to be used in textbooks teaching U.S. history and immediately ignited another battle in the cultural wars . They then released the guidelines for teaching world history , an act some compare to throwing gasoline onto a firestorm . The fight over the nation ' s memory of its past is nothing less than a struggle for political control of the country ' s future . Americans may be famous for their historical amnesia , but they are passionately divided about how they want their nation ' s history told . It began when Congress decided to bolster students ' competency in the humanities by commissioning a teachers ' guide for fifth through 12th grades . Lynne Cheney , who as chair of the National Endowment during the Bush_Administration , appointed a panel of historians to provide a standard for the history curriculum . To her dismay , these scholars have emerged with a story she didn ' t want told . The document is too &quot; gloomy , &quot; Cheney complains . American history should celebrate the country ' s accomplishments . What is so repugnant about this new history curriculum ? It views the past with a critical , rather than a simply celebratory perspective . It argues that no nation , not even the United States , is without flaws . Massacres of indigenous peoples , the enslavement of Africans and the killing of striking workers are also a part of our nation ' s complicated past . But the new history is not all gloom and doom . It also celebrates the passionate efforts by the named and unnamed to broaden the nation ' s commitment to democracy . The new history is inclusive . Rather than focusing only on great men and triumphant events , the new history integrates the lives of ordinary people -- women , ethnic and racial minorities and workers -- into the nation ' s story . Is the new history , as some critics claim , an example of political correctness gone awry ? No , but it may seem that way to those who insist upon an &quot; official &quot; story that fantasizes the unblemished triumph of American democracy . The truth is , every generation of historians rewrites the past . What the right really hates about this new history is that it has been written by some of the same people who fought against segregation and gender discrimination , who protested the Vietnam_War and gave_birth to the environmental and gay-rights movements . It is a generation that has witnessed -- in Watergate and in the S &amp; L failures of the 1980s -- too_much political and economic corruption to collaborate in a cover-up account of the nation ' s past . It is a generation that believes the democratic promise of America , magnificent as it is , is still unfolding and has yet to be realized by everyone . This generation of historians has produced an immense body of scholarship that challenges the congratulatory story of American history . They have asked hard questions and sought honest answers . Why , for example , did a nation founded on the stunning vision of justice and equality establish a republic reliant_on a slave economy ? Why has a society that has depended_on the cheap labor of immigrants launched periodic crusades against them ? Cultural critics on the right worry that such questions will erode students ' patriotism . But real love -- whether for a person or a nation -- develops out of a full acceptance of the beloved ' s strengths and weaknesses . The new history depicts successive generations of Americans seeking access to the nation ' s political and economic life . But it also describes the racial , gender and class barriers that have excluded some citizens from participating in the American_dream . For the new historians , the great experiment in American democracy is still unfolding . The right ' s quarrel with this version of the past is that they believe the United States has already fulfilled its democratic promise . History , in other words , is over . But history never ends . Nor do unpleasant truths destroy a nation ' s social fabric . The real danger to a democracy is an official history written to justify the status_quo . George Orwell understood the magnitude of this threat , writing in his classic novel , &quot; 1984 &quot; : &quot; Who controls the past , controls the future ; who controls the present controls the past. &quot;</TEXT>
