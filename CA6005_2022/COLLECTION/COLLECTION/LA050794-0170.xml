   <HEADLINE> UNDERWEAR FIRM BETTING_ON THE POWER OF INTERNET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How do you get pants onto a twentysomething ? The Internet , of course . that ' s Joe Boxer ' s new ad strategy . On bus shelter posters and billboards in California , the designer underwear maker features a torso-down picture of a model wearing bright yellow boxer shorts painted with a happy face . After its slogan , where one might expect to find an address , phone_number or store name , there ' s only : &quot; Contact us in underwear cyberspace ; Internet ! joeboxer.jboxer.com &quot; Cryptic to many , perhaps , but not to the plugged-in . The young and computer savvy are prime customers for Joe Boxer Inc. , a privately held San Francisco company known for wild designs and wilder advertising . Its executives figured that electronic_mail would be a hip way to stay in touch with them . So , a_few months ago , Joe Boxer gave_up its toll-free phone_line for an address on the Internet , the worldwide network of private , public and academic computer_networks . The number had been used to direct people to stores that sell Joe Boxer boxers . But e-mail has given the company more contact with the customers who use it . About 15 to 20 messages arrive a day and each gets an individual response . &quot; It opens_up one-on-one communication . Rather than calling an 800 number and getting an operator who just has some information , they get the Joe Boxer culture -- really wacky and really real , &quot; said Tessa Graham , the company ' s international coordinator . &quot; This way we can have real communication with our customers , &quot; she said . &quot; They can directly ask us the specific question they want to ask . And it lets us find_out who these people who love our underwear are. &quot; There ' s more and more commerce on the Internet . Many computer companies have e-mail access to their customers and more non-technical businesses are entering the electronic arena . One , The Internet Mall , offers everything from books to flowers . But for most , e-mail is only an adjunct to more traditional marketing and service . Joe Boxer seems to be one of the first non-technical companies to make e-mail its primary method for talking to customers . The company has been using the e-mail address since February . The ads began last month in San Francisco and Los Angeles and appeared in Details magazine . &quot; I think it ' s a very smart campaign , &quot; said John Hoag , director of marketing at BARRNet , an Internet service provider in Palo Alto . &quot; Having an e-mail address is becoming as important in business as having a telephone_number . There are 20 million people on the Internet . we ' ll definitely be seeing more of this , &quot; he said . The messages Joe Boxer gets range from perky to risque . &quot; I ' m a student at Brandeis University , &quot; one man wrote . &quot; I used your campaign for a paper I had to write_about advertising . I got an A and to celebrate my girlfriend bought me a pair of the ( Nose Not Included ) boxers. &quot;</TEXT>
