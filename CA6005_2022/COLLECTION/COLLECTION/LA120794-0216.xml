   <HEADLINE> UNITED WAY STUDY SHOWS POOR ' S HEALTH NEEDS UNMET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s poor have &quot; alarming &quot; unmet health-care needs because they often lack insurance coverage and are stymied by other barriers to treatment , including language and transportation difficulties , according to a United Way report Tuesday . Nearly three-fourths of the county ' s poor have never been to a doctor for a regular checkup , and 41 % of those with chronic illnesses such_as diabetes , heart_disease and asthma said they are not receiving treatment for those conditions , according to a survey of more_than 700 residents . Ethnicity as well as poverty is a factor_in determining who gets treatment , according to the study , conducted by the United Way of Orange County Health_Care Council in collaboration with UC Irvine physician Shiraz I . Mishra . More_than one in six said they had faced language_barriers when seeking medical treatment . And a third of Latinos said they lacked a regular source of care , compared to 11 % of whites . Mishra presented the report Tuesday to the board of directors of OPTIMA , the organization charged with revamping services for the county ' s 300 # 000 recipients of Medi-Cal , the government health_insurance program for the poor . One OPTIMA board_member , Dr. Peter Anderson , said that while the presentation was valuable , the report did not address all_of the reasons why people do not seek basic medical treatment . By and large , he said , children in Orange County have access to pediatricians , and public health clinics offer free immunizations for youngsters under the age of 2 . Still , &quot; we have a tremendous problem with the vaccination rate , &quot; said Anderson , chief of emergency medicine at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical_Center and president of the Orange County Medical Assn . &quot; The situation is not that we don ' t have the access , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just that parents don ' t take their kids in. &quot; That , he said , is a sociological problem that might not be entirely resolved &quot; no matter what system we set up. &quot; The United Way survey suggests that poverty alone does not explain failure to vaccinate children . More_than a sixth of poor children younger than 7 had never been immunized against diphtheria , tetanus , polio , measles , mumps and rubella . But a fifth of &quot; non-poor &quot; children in the same age range had never received measles , mumps or rubella shots either . * The survey found , however , that poor people do not get many other preventive and primary care services as often as those with higher incomes . The definition of &quot; poor &quot; was 125 % or less of what the federal_government defines as poverty-level income . For a family of four , that would be an annual income of $ 17 # 919 or less . Non-poor families were defined as those having incomes above $ 28 # 670 . More_than a third of poor residents had not made an outpatient medical visit in the past year , compared to only 18 % of non-poor residents . Among women 40 or older , more_than twice as_many poor as non-poor respondents had never had a mammogram . Poor people were more likely than others to have to ride the bus or rely_on a friend for transportation to medical appointments , the survey found , and to lack insurance coverage for prescription_drugs and such services as mental_health care and drug and alcohol treatment . The report recommended that a community-based system be developed for poor and &quot; nearly poor &quot; people who have no regular source of health_care . It should emphasize preventive services for children and adults , the report said , and should be publicized in English , Spanish and , if possible , some Asian languages . Translation , transportation and child-care services also were recommended for poor patients . The survey , conducted with the help of Field Research Corp . of San Francisco , was based on telephone_interviews conducted in English and Spanish with 718 Orange County residents . The margin of error was plus or minus 2 % . Results are to be presented to the County Board of Supervisors in January with a plan_of_action prepared by United Way .</TEXT>
