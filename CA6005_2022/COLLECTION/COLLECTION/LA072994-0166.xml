   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; A SOLID , LOVING TALE OF ' BEAUTY ' ; CREATED , AS THE NOVEL WAS , FROM THE HEART , THIS ' BLACK BEAUTY ' IS AS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD AS ITS SOURCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I am writing the life of a horse , &quot; Anna Sewell modestly confided to her journal in what proved to be quite an understatement . Her 1877 novel , &quot; Black Beauty , &quot; described as being &quot; translated from the original equine , &quot; became the horse story of all time , reaching worldwide sales of 20 million by 1935 and gaining a permanent place in the fantasies of children . Sewell ' s first and only novel ( she died shortly after it was published ) has been brought_to the screen several times , but screenwriter Caroline Thompson ( &quot; Edward Scissorhands , &quot; &quot; Homeward Bound , &quot; &quot; The Secret Garden &quot; ) was happy with none of the attempts . She wanted to stick closer to the original , and , as a lifelong horse lover , felt the only way to guarantee that was to make the film her directing debut as well . Created , as the novel was , from the heart , this latest version of &quot; Black Beauty &quot; is as simple and straightforward as its source . Though not especially inspired , it uses integrity to make_up for that lack , and its unaffected &quot; just the oats , ma ' am &quot; approach makes_it a fine film for younger viewers . While she has made some small_changes in the plot , Thompson has retained the book ' s straight-from-the-horse ' s-mouth conceit . Introduced happily grazing by a limpid stream , Black Beauty is quick to tell us ( in a voiceover read , sometimes too enthusiastically , by Alan Cumming ) , that things weren ' t always so cushy . &quot; Mine is a story of trust and betrayal and learning to trust again , &quot; the horse informs us . &quot; And I remember everything. &quot; &quot; Everything &quot; includes the act of being born ( something Sewell would n ' t have dreamed of describing ) into a pleasant farm in that storybook England where the gentry ruled and servants knew their place . Between kindly Farmer Grey ( Sean Bean ) and Beauty ' s wise mother , he learns all he can before reality takes_over . &quot; We don ' t get_to choose the people in our lives , &quot; Beauty astutely points_out . &quot; For us , it ' s all chance. &quot; The first family Beauty lands with is a good one , and the horse is put_under the wise care of the aptly named John Manly ( Jim Carter ) and his good-hearted but initially clueless assistant Joe ( &quot; Secret Garden ' s &quot; Andrew Knott ) . But even performing heroic deeds and risking his life can ' t save Beauty from being sold into the stables of unfeeling aristocrats Lord and Lady Wexmire ( Peter Cook and Eleanor Bron ) , where all horses must be slaves to fashion though they be treated cruelly in the process . One of the reasons Sewell , an animal-rights activist before her time , wrote &quot; Black Beauty &quot; was to forcefully protest the several ways horses were mistreated , and to Thompson ' s credit this aspect of the book is given its due and the philosophy that &quot; kind treatment makes_good horses &quot; enthusiastically supported . Conversely , perhaps the most curious change from the book , and one whose silliness will be apparent even to those who haven ' t read it , is the decision to jump-start the relationship between Beauty and Ginger , the high-strung mare who is his sometime stablemate . While in the best Victorian tradition of the original , the two horses told the press they were just good friends , the film has Beauty fall giddily and rather preposterously in_love with Ginger , to_the_point of exclaiming at one point , &quot; She likes me , she really likes me. &quot; Perhaps Thompson felt the staid original needed a bit more juice , but this solution is not a workable one . Though the energetic American quarter_horse who plays Beauty is deservedly the film ' s center_of_attention , the picture comes most alive in its second_half , when David Thewlis enters as Jerry Barker , the kindly London cabbie who shows the horse what it ' s like to live and work in the big city . While this simple part is literally a drive through the park for Thewlis after his agonizing starring role in Mike Leigh ' s &quot; Naked , &quot; his ability to bring a_level of emotional connection to the portrayal makes his scenes stand_out as the most believable around . Thompson also gets good marks for resisting the temptation to over-sentimentalize &quot; Beauty ' s &quot; story . But , more workmanlike than dazzling as a director , she is unable to bring the kind of excitement or magic to the project that animated a classic horse movie like Carroll Ballard ' s &quot; The Black Stallion. &quot; This picture is not that kind of thoroughbred , but it is solid and dependable , and those qualities are no doubt rarer in films than they are in horses . * MPAA rating : G .
