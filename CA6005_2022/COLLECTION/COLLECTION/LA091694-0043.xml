   <TEXT> With military preparations pointing to an imminent U.S. invasion of Haiti , President Clinton delivered a blunt message to the Caribbean nation ' s military_leaders Thursday night : &quot; Your time is up . Leave now or we will force you from power. &quot; &quot; We have exhausted diplomacy , &quot; the President said . &quot; Now the United States must protect its interests : to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians , to secure our borders and preserve stability in our hemisphere and to promote democracy and uphold the reliability of our commitment around the world. &quot; Clinton , tacitly harking_back to his own days as an anti-Vietnam War activist , insisted that he was moving toward the use of military_force only after exhausting all other avenues for restoring Jean-Bertrand Aristide , the only freely elected president in Haiti ' s history , to the office he lost in a Sept . 30 , 1991 , coup . &quot; I know that the United States cannot and should not be the world ' s policeman , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; But we have a responsibility to respond when inhumanity offends our values . And we have a particular interest in stopping brutality when it occurs so close to our shores. &quot; Clinton ' s nationally televised speech from the White_House marked his first full-scale effort to lay out the case for U.S. intervention . He sought both to frighten Haiti ' s defiant dictators into giving_up without a fight and -- failing that -- to persuade a skeptical American public that restoring democracy to the impoverished island nation is worth its cost in blood and treasure . H faced an uphill task with both audiences . In Port-au-Prince , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , interviewed by CBS-TV immediately after Clinton ' s address , declared , &quot; I will fight with my people and I am prepared to die. &quot; In an earlier interview with the network , he had said that a U.S. invasion would lead to civil_war and a &quot; massacre. &quot; He predicted &quot; loss of life on both sides and also civilian casualties. &quot; In the United States , meanwhile , public_opinion_polls and scattered anti-invasion demonstrations continued to underline just how far Clinton has to go_to make his case on the home front . An ABC News poll released Monday found that 73 % of Americans oppose a U.S. invasion of Haiti , and 60 % say that the country ' s vital interests are not at stake . Other polls have produced similar results . And on Capitol_Hill , anti-invasion sentiment was growing in both the Senate and House . Shortly before Clinton ' s speech , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry announced that about 1 # 600 military reservists will be called_up for possible service in Haiti , a step that is almost unavoidable under the Pentagon ' s present system of organizing its forces but one that surely will make the operation even more controversial . Reserve call-ups disrupt the lives of the individuals involved and can affect their families , employers and communities . Under the Pentagon ' s present manpower system , however , many support functions for active-duty combat forces -- including medical treatment , transportation and military policing -- have been assigned to reserve units . &quot; I hope the invasion will not be necessary , &quot; Perry said , echoing the President ' s argument . &quot; I hope that simply the preparation for this invasion will focus the thinking of the military regime there on what the clear alternatives are. &quot; But he added : &quot; As each day goes_by and our preparations increase and our ships start moving toward Haiti , I think it becomes harder and harder for them to doubt our resolve. &quot; From Clinton ' s standpoint , the only avenue to a clear victory is for Cedras and his two chief aides , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby and Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois , to step_down in the face of overwhelming American power . Such an outcome could restore Aristide to power without jeopardizing American lives . Clinton_Administration officials said the President is considering the dispatch of an emissary , possibly Rep . Bill Richardson ( D-N.M. ) , to make a final appeal_to Cedras to step_down . Richardson visited Port-au-Prince earlier this year and Cedras has invited him to return . In building his case for U.S. military_action , Clinton relied heavily on charges of gross human_rights violations by Cedras and his supporters . &quot; Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign_of_terror , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Executing children . Raping women . Killing priests . As the dictators have grown more desperate , the atrocities have grown ever more brutal. &quot; In addition , the President said that restoration of Aristide -- a winner with two-thirds of the vote_in the only internationally recognized free and fair election ever to take_place in Haiti -- is the only way to prevent a flood of Haitian refugees from trying to reach the United States or other countries in the hemisphere . &quot; As long as Cedras rules , Haitians will continue to seek sanctuary in our nation , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Three hundred_thousand more Haitians -- 5 % of their entire population -- are in hiding . If we do not act , they will be the next wave of refugees at our door. &quot; If the Haitian dictators stand_fast and Clinton orders the invasion , a quick military victory seems assured because Haiti ' s ragtag army of about 7 # 000 men would be hopelessly overmatched against the allied force of at least 20 # 000 well-armed troops . But if there are substantial American casualties or embarrassing accidents caused by the fog of war , the operation could seem to be a defeat for the Administration , even if all military objectives are ultimately met . At the Pentagon , Perry conceded that some American losses are all but inevitable . &quot; I do not want to take at all lightly the possibilities of casualties in a forced entry , &quot; the defense_secretary said . And it did not take long for the operation to produce an embarrassing mishap . A Navy patrol_boat , the Monsoon , went aground on what the Navy said was an uncharted sandbar about two miles off the coast of Haiti ; its crew was working Thursday night to free the vessel with the rising tide . As Clinton spoke , military preparations for an invasion continued . The force , including Special Forces and members of the Army ' s airborne corps from Ft . Bragg , N.C. , is slated to carry_out an initial strike against the island nation . In addition , 1 # 800 Marines and 2 # 000 light infantry Army soldiers are in place to handle post-attack duties such_as peacekeeping efforts as the Aristide government is returned to Port-au-Prince . On Thursday , the Mount_Whitney , which will be the command and control ship for an invasion , left Norfolk , Va. , on its way to Haitian waters . Sources said it could take_up to 72 hours to arrive in the region but that military commanders can direct operations even if the ship is still en route . Dennis Boxx , a Defense_Department spokesman , said that a fleet of more_than 20 ships will be in place in the region to facilitate an invasion . They will include two aircraft_carriers , a destroyer , several frigates and 14 cargo_ships carrying heavy equipment to breach the Haitian seaport . Clinton ' s decision to activate 1 # 600 reservists was dictated by shrinking military budgets following the Vietnam_War that caused the Pentagon to shift to the reserves many noncombat military_units such_as lawyers , engineers and administrators who are trained to assist in re-establishment of civilian government after combat . Because the use of reserves generates so_much resistance , the Lyndon B . Johnson and Richard Nixon administrations shunned their use in Vietnam to avoid further inflaming opposition to that conflict . But reservists were used in the Persian_Gulf_War against Iraq . &quot; The call-up does not include general-purpose combat troops , &quot; Perry said . &quot; It includes reservists in specialties of tactical airlift , port operations , military_police , medical support and civil affairs. &quot; Although the initial activation is only for three months , it seems certain that some reservists will be needed for far longer than that .
