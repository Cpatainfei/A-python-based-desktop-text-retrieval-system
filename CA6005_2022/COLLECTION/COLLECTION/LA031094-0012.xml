   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ERIC MANN / CHRIS MATHIS : POOR PEOPLE AGAIN TAKE THE TOXIC BRUNT ; PROPOSED AIR-POLLUTION RULES FOR THE L.A. BASIN REWARD ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For many people who know of the South Coast Air Quality Management District from its own press_releases , the agency ' s image as a hard-hitting , even Draconian , enforcer of anti-pollution laws is still in the air . But our members have attended more_than 30 board_meetings over the past four years and our direct experience has been chilling . We have seen AQMD board_members calling a public hearing and then walking_off to have lunch while people testified to a dais of empty chairs . We have organized people from Wilmington , South-Central and East L.A. to take a day_off from work only to have the AQMD insult community representatives and refuse to provide the promised translation for Spanish speakers . We have walked into meetings with an impressive multiracial grass-roots delegation of more_than 100 people only to be confronted by an army of more_than 250 paid lobbyists , all_of them able to call each board_member by first_name . This leads us to have little hope of affecting the AQMD ' s crucial vote Friday on air quality near industrial_plants . But we have to try , because the AQMD board is_on the verge of legalizing dangerous quantities of toxic emissions from industrial sources in the Los Angeles basin . The primary AQMD mandate under the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce smog-producing chemicals -- oxides of nitrogen , ozone , particulate matter and carbon_monoxide . But smog is not the only problem , and the AQMD has identified 89 chemicals as air toxics , meaning they have been determined to cause cancer , leukemia , severe damage to the central nervous , respiratory , reproductive and immune_systems , and more . Poor communities and people_of_color are disproportionately affected by such poisons , and their civil_rights are being violated by the AQMD . Some history : In 1987 , the Legislature passed the Air Toxics Information Act , giving &quot; hot spot &quot; communities the formal right to know the chemicals to which they are exposed and their known health dangers . The AQMD was told to write letters to residents in plain language , disclosing emissions and their risks . It was never enforced . In 1992 , after five years of AQMD inaction , the Labor / Community Strategy Center , Mothers of East Los Angeles ( Santa Isabel ) and Concerned Citizens of South-Central L.A. pushed the agency to rule that any facility posing a significant risk level of 10 additional cancers per million people exposed would trigger AQMD warning letters to affected residents and mandate meetings between the community and the company . Two years later , not one major polluter has complied with that law , and the AQMD has not enforced it . As Wilmington environmental activist Carlos Molina told the board recently , &quot; Low-income communities of color suffer from severe health_problems because of air_pollution . You acted sympathetic but then turned_around and . . . stabbed us in the back. &quot; The AQMD caved_in to industry with its &quot; pollution-trading &quot; credits . Now it is pushing ahead with a plan to set incredibly lax standards for toxic chemicals from industry -- including the right for each company to emit poisons that would cause up_to 100 extra lifetime cancers in a population of 1 million . The desirable standard is 1 per million . We would settle for 10 . Not 99.9. Hoping against hope that the AQMD might listen , we propose that the rule-making be postponed for a year , during which time the &quot; right to know &quot; rule would be enforced , in_order to give affected communities the knowledge they need to participate in the process . After that year , the AQMD should mandate emission reductions in three categories : * Firms that pose the greatest risk to the &quot; maximum exposed individual &quot; -- a hypothetical person receiving the highest possible dose . * Firms that expose the largest_number of people to risk , such_as the Arco refinery in Carson that exposes more_than 13 # 000 people to toxic emissions . * Firms that emit the largest quantities of toxics per year , such_as Arco , with 485 # 000 pounds per year , or Texaco ' s Wilmington oil_refinery , with more_than 240 # 000 pounds . The communities must have a voice in this rule-making . Currently , AQMD rules are heavily influenced by representatives of the oil , chemical , metal-plating , dry_cleaning and aerospace industries . If the new emission rules are approved , the battle will continue , whether in the media , in the courts , in the streets or all three . The AQMD should not think it will be able to breathe easily .</TEXT>
