   <HEADLINE> GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After nearly three years of fruitless verbal sparring , Israel and Syria may at last be ready to get serious about trying to reach a tenable peace . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher plans another trip to the Middle_East soon , and he ' s prepared to shuttle between Jerusalem and Damascus if it appears the two countries are prepared to discuss a framework for peace . The word from Washington is that Christopher is encouraged . In Jerusalem Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin has proposed a partial Israeli withdrawal on the Golan Heights , captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War . For nearly two decades before that , the Golan was an occasional gun platform for Syrian attacks on Israel . The area ' s strategic importance is a key reason why more_than 13 # 000 Israelis have been encouraged to settle there . Rabin ' s plan for an early Israeli pullback on the Golan in exchange for Syria ' s moving to normalize relations evoked immediate opposition in Israel from those who see continued occupation of the plateau as essential to Israel ' s security . The noise_level is sure to swell if a basis for negotiations in fact is found . that ' s because Israeli Cabinet officials have rushed to describe the Rabin plan as no more_than an opening negotiating gambit , the clear implication being that at the first sign of give_in Syria ' s position Israel would quickly produce a more flexible offer . Any negotiations promise to be hard and complex , yet at least on the territorial question the outcome of successful talks can be largely foreseen . Syria insists on control of the Golan because it refuses to accept the permanent presence of Israeli forces within artillery range of Damascus , and because no Syrian leader could survive if he gave_up sovereignty over even a tiny part of Syrian territory . Control of the Golan is vital to Israel because it is determined that never again will its communities be shelled from Syrian territory . Syria won ' t settle for anything less than virtually total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan over a relatively few years , which is what Egypt got_in the Sinai_Peninsula . Israel justifiably can accept nothing less than the territory ' s full demilitarization , with international monitors helping to assure that Syrian guns never again threaten Israel . Can a framework and timetable be hammered_out that would meet the basic interests of the two sides ? Recent words from Damascus have been conciliatory . Does this mean that agreement is indeed in_sight ? that ' s the central assessment Christopher will be making during his coming journey , perhaps one of the most important of his tenure .</TEXT>
