   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS ; AFTER JOYFUL GAMES , A PLEA FOR PEACE ; CLOSING CEREMONY : AS THE WORLD SAYS GOODBY TO LILLEHAMMER , SAMARANCH SAYS THAT SARAJEVO IS NOT FORGOTTEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The XVII Winter_Olympics , the most celebrated of these Games despite -- or perhaps somehow because of -- an attention-grabbing sideshow , passed joyously into history here Sunday night amid a moving plea for peace in another Olympic city and another for respect for human_rights . As the Olympic flame died in the Lysgardsbakkene ski-jumping arena , the 40 # 000 spectators in the stadium switched_on flashlights in a silent plea for peace in war-torn Sarajevo , host city of the 1984 Winter Games , and around the world . Earlier in the program , International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch hushed the exuberant crowd when he said , &quot; Ten years ago we were in Sarajevo . After many horrors , the situation now seems to be improving . Let us hope that this ( 17-day-old ) truce -- to which , in our very limited way , we may have contributed -- let us hope that this truce will turn_into lasting peace . For us , and also for our children. &quot; Then , cheers ringing around him , he added , &quot; Dear Sarajevo . We do not forget you . We will continue to support you. &quot; Actress Liv Ullmann and explorer Thor Heyerdahl , hostess and host for the opening and closing ceremonies , alternated in reading the Declaration of Human_Rights , Ullmann delivering the final line , &quot; We have the right to life. &quot; Heyerdahl intoned , &quot; The Olympic flame here at Lillehammer has been extinguished , but we know this flame will never die . It will burn forever , in different places around the world . . . . In the meantime , let us continue in the tradition of peace. &quot; Woven into a stylishly choreographed fantasy , the solemn messages lent serious meaning to an outburst of song and Norwegian folklore that matched the tone the Games had sustained for two weeks , even while sharing the spotlight . The development-a-day story of figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan commanded much of the media ' s attention here , simply because it was too bizarre to be ignored . It began in Detroit on Jan . 6 , when an attacker clubbed Kerrigan in the knee with a metal baton before she could skate in the national championships , knocking her out of that competition . Kerrigan recovered and was named to the Olympic team , winning a silver medal behind Oksana Baiul of Ukraine and then heading_off to Disney World . Harding , implicated in the plot against Kerrigan , sued the U.S. Olympic Committee and was allowed to compete , but she did not fare as well as Kerrigan , finishing eighth . She commanded attention right to the end , however , when she broke a skate lace in warm-ups before her free program , was late getting_to the ice , then had to interrupt her program to get a replacement lace and was given a re-skate . Even with all that going_on , however , the Games more_than held their own . Enthusiastic , flag-waving Norwegian crowds packed the skiing and skating venues in unprecedented numbers and the sound of the cowbell was heard in the land . Television ratings , particularly in the United States , were among the highest in history , as people tuned_in to catch the latest Tonya-Nancy development and stayed tuned to see what else was going_on . And there was a lot going_on . Dan Jansen slipped_in the 500 meters , but finally got his gold medal and a world_record in the 1 # 000 in men ' s speedskating . He carried his daughter around the rink and carried the flag in the closing ceremony . Bonnie Blair became the greatest female U.S. medalist of all time with two more golds . Norway ' s Johann Olav Koss set three world_records to show who was boss . U.S. skiers had one of their most successful Olympics . Tommy Moe won the downhill and was second in the super-G . Diann Roffe-Steinrotter won the women ' s super-G . Cathy Turner even managed to turn short-track speedskating into pro wrestling . Said Samaranch in congratulating Lillehammer and the country , &quot; To you , the people of Norway , it is my great honor to say that you are the real winners of these magic games . You have presented to the entire world the best Olympic Winter Games ever. &quot; The Norwegians couldn ' t help but agree . Suddenly , the spectators were singing &quot; Seieren Er Vaar , &quot; the Norwegian victory song , just as they had been doing for two weeks during the Games .</TEXT>
