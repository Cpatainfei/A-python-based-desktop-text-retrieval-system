   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; ' BODILY FUNCTIONS ' SHOWCASES THREE FOREIGN ANIMATORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Bodily Functions , &quot; a program of three foreign animated shorts presented on &quot; Alive TV &quot; tonight , demonstrates the haunting power of genuine surrealism -- and the weakness of artsy posturing . In &quot; Food , &quot; a three-part rumination on hunger and waste , the acclaimed Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer seamlessly blends pixilation , live-action and stop-motion animation.These eerie vignettes depict humans devolving into vending_machines and cannibals with a calm logic that renders the scenarios all_the more unsettling . Simultaneously realistic and dreamlike , &quot; Food &quot; demonstrates Svankmajer ' s extraordinary skill at manipulating visuals to touch deep inner chords . Beriou uses computer techniques to simulate the metamorphosis of body_parts , photographs and butterflies in &quot; Ex-Memoriam &quot; ( France ) . With its pretentious sci-fi narrative , &quot; Memoriam &quot; remains an arid exercise in technique that never really connects with the viewer . As Beriou has observed , &quot; ' Ex-Memoriam ' cannot really be called a film ; even less can it be called a story. &quot; Nor can it be called entertaining . &quot; Deadsy &quot; ( Scotland ) , by David Anderson , has screened locally in several programs of short films . Ostensibly an examination of &quot; man ' s fascination with weaponry and the sexual power of military aggression , &quot; &quot; Deadsy &quot; combines a pseudo-Joycean soundtrack with a disorganized collage of multimedia imagery that rarely rises above the sophomoric . * &quot; Bodily Functions &quot; airs at 11:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 . It is preceded at 11 p.m. by another &quot; Alive TV &quot; installment featuring the Oscar-nominated live-action short &quot; Down on the Waterfront , &quot; with Ed Asner and Jason Alexander .
