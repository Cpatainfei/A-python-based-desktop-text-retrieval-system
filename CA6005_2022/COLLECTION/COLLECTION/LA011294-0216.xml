   <HEADLINE> LUNGREN URGES MOLESTER DATA IN LIBRARIES ; CRIME : BILL WOULD MAKE NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF OFFENDERS AVAILABLE . ATTORNEY_GENERAL ' S OVERALL CRIME REPORT SHOWS MAJOR OFFENSES DOWN 3.8 % IN 1993 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atty . Gen . Daniel Lungren , California ' s top law_enforcement official , on Tuesday called_for legislation to make the names , pictures and descriptions of convicted child_molesters available at county libraries . With crime dominating the 1994 legislative session , Lungren also released a report showing that major crime dropped_by 3.8 % across California in the first nine months of 1993 , but that homicide increased by 2.6 % , based on preliminary reports by 49 police agencies in the state . Lungren ' s crime report showed that violent crime in California dropped 4.1 % from 1992 to 1993 . Rape declined the most , falling 7.5 % . It was the fifth year in a row that rape decreased . Property crime , including burglary and auto theft , dropped_by 3.7 % . At the same time , Lungren reported an 18.9 % increase in the legal sale of guns , with 665 # 229 firearms sold in 1993 . In his State of the Public Safety speech , Lungren announced his support for a bill making the names , criminal histories , physical descriptions and photos of all felony child_molesters available at county libraries , with updates twice a year . &quot; In a dangerous and uncertain world , parents should be empowered with the information they need to protect their children , &quot; Lungren told the Comstock Club , an organization of business people . Lungren said he believes parents would use the information to notify police whenever they see people matching the descriptions of molesters at parks or near schools . &quot; I ' m not afraid of empowering people , &quot; Lungren said . In Washington state , which has a similar law , people in Lynnwood , north of Seattle , torched the home of a convicted molester in July . The Washington law gives law_enforcement authorities the right to release addresses of sex offenders , but does not require them to do so . To protect against vigilantism , Lungren said , his proposal would not allow_for molesters ' addresses to be publicly released . But the communities and ZIP_codes in which they live would become available . Lungren ' s proposal will be in a bill being pushed by Assemblywoman Barbara Alby ( R-Fair Oaks ) . The measure seeks to deter people from attacking molesters by adding five years to the prison_terms of anyone convicted of using the information about molesters to commit a felony . California has 64 # 614 registered sex offenders , 20 # 236 of whom live_in Los Angeles County . Lungren ' s aides did not know how many registered sex offenders are convicted child_molesters . On the other crime statistics , Lungren blamed the rise in homicide on juveniles , who he said are becoming increasingly violent . He called_for legislation requiring juveniles age 16 or 17 who use firearms in a crime to be charged as adults . He said legislation should be passed allowing prosecutors to charge those who illegally give a firearm to a minor with a felony , and said minors who use guns illegally should lose their driver ' s licenses and cars . Lungren attributed the drop_in crime to increased incarceration , pointing_out that 120 # 000 people are in state_prisons today , compared to 24 # 500 in 1980 . He noted that the Department of Corrections budget is $ 2.7 billion , or $ 85 for every Californian .</TEXT>
