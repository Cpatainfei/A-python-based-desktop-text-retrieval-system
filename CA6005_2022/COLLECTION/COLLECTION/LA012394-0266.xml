   <HEADLINE> NO LETUP IN TRADE PRESSURE ON TOKYO , U.S. OFFICIALS SAY ; ASIA : WASHINGTON DOESN ' T SEE JAPAN ' S RECESSION AS REASON TO BACK OFF . SUMMIT RUN-UP LIKELY TO BE TENSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A few weeks ago , one of the Clinton_Administration ' s senior policy-makers recalled with annoyance the time last year when Japan argued that its airlines were too economically fragile to permit new competition from American carriers . &quot; Here we ' ve had bankruptcies , restructuring , a real shakeout in our own airline industry , &quot; the U.S. official said . &quot; Now that we ' re lean and mean , they can ' t keep us out . Japan can ' t say we ' re too good and ban us from their market . What if we ' d said that to Toyota and Datsun in the 1960s ? &quot; It was just a casual remark , but it illustrated the changing dynamics between the United States and Japan . And it demonstrated why the relationship between the two countries seems headed for a period of considerable tension as President Clinton and Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa prepare_for a summit next month . The American economy is strengthening , while Japan ' s remains in deep recession . The best-selling car in America is a Ford , not a Honda . For the first time since Harvard professor Ezra F . Vogel published his 1979 bestseller , &quot; Japan as Number One , &quot; the perception is taking_hold in America that the Japanese economy might be downright mortal . Does this mean the United States will ease the pressure for Japan to bring_down its huge trade surplus with the rest of the world ? Absolutely not , answer Administration officials . In a series of recent interviews , top U.S. officials made_it plain that despite Japan ' s recession -- or indeed , in some ways because of it -- the United States intends to mount an intensive new drive for Japan to open_up its markets to foreign goods . &quot; The basic economic facts of the world haven ' t changed because we ' re up and they ' re down , &quot; said W . Bowman Cutter , deputy director of the National Economic Council . &quot; The fundamental fact is that the Japanese economy has not been as open as the U.S. or European economies. &quot; His remarks underscored another important way in which Washington ' s policy toward Japan is changing . In the past , members of Congress like Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) led the way in pressing for tough trade measures with Tokyo . Now , under the Clinton_Administration , Congress is relatively quiet and the executive_branch is leading the charge . Today , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen will meet with Hosokawa in Tokyo to discuss transpacific trade problems in_advance of next month ' s summit . Clinton took_office a year ago with a pledge to end or radically reduce the American trade imbalance with Japan . Administration officials acknowledge that the President decided to back_off last July while elections were pending in Japan . And he continued to avoid confrontation in the summer and fall after Hosokawa took_over as the first prime_minister in nearly four decades from outside Japan ' s Liberal Democratic Party . Hosokawa ' s campaign to revamp Japanese politics suffered a severe blow on Friday when lawmakers voted_down his package of reforms , and some observers said the prime_minister might even be a lame_duck when he faces Clinton in Washington -- if the summit goes_ahead as planned . But with the American trade_deficit with Japan still running at $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion a year , Administration officials realize they need to make_headway with Tokyo quickly -- or face the prospect that the President will be criticized in the 1996 election for having failed in his Japan policies . Cutter and other top U.S. officials argue that the Administration has already given more_than enough time and breathing room to Hosokawa ' s coalition government . &quot; We have to tell Hosokawa , ' We laid low , we gave you a_few months , we held_back . You have to come_through at this point , ' &quot; another senior U.S. official said . At the moment , it appears Washington and Tokyo have such vastly different expectations of one another that they are_on a collision course . There have been suggestions that , during their meeting scheduled for Feb . 11 , Hosokawa may ask Clinton to help ease Japan ' s recession . Yoichi Funabashi , Washington bureau chief for Tokyo ' s Asahi Shimbun , said recently that the Hosokawa government may seek temporary depreciation of the yen so Japanese companies can have &quot; better confidence for the future. &quot; Such a change in the exchange_rates would make Japanese exports to this country cheaper and U.S. exports to Japan more expensive . Administration officials scoff at that idea , noting that there are some in Washington who believe the yen should be pushed to even higher levels . And more broadly , they reject the principle that the Administration should ease its trade_policies to help Japan climb out of recession . &quot; In the midst of the ( American ) recessions of 1979 , 1982 and 1989 , we kept our markets open , &quot; Cutter said . &quot; We lost manufacturing jobs , and Japanese industry gained . . . . We ' re not asking the Japanese to do anything we haven ' t done. &quot; For their part , Japanese officials regularly insist that their economy is already open -- although last August , Hiroshi Kumagai , Hosokawa ' s trade minister , acknowledged that &quot; Japanese markets are extremely closed_in invisible ways. &quot; Administration officials contend that the proof is in the results : Japan still imports far fewer manufactured goods -- when measured against the country ' s gross_national_product -- than any of the world ' s other leading industrialized democracies . And Japan ' s trade surplus , both with the United States and the world as_a_whole , remains huge . In the American view , the recession in Japan has altered the dynamics of the negotiations between Washington and Tokyo in a number of ways . First , Administration officials say the slump has inevitably increased protectionist pressures in Japan . &quot; This is the scariest downturn they ' ve had since the end of the war , &quot; Cutter said . &quot; We ' re running into extraordinary resistance. &quot; Second , the recession has heightened fears in Washington that without some dramatic changes in policy from Tokyo , the American trade_deficit with Japan may widen still further . Because of the downturn , Japanese consumers can be expected to buy fewer goods . Third , Japan ' s recession appears to have touched_off a new sense of resentment in Washington about Japan ' s restricted markets . Administration officials argue that the United States has already withstood economic pain and dislocation and that Japan should be prepared to do so too . &quot; Japanese companies had unfettered access to our markets to beat the ( expletive ) out of us for years , &quot; said one senior Administration official . &quot; Other countries have accepted the pain of adjustment . . . . In some sense , Japan forced us to get lean and mean in many sectors. &quot; Finally , the recession has prompted the Administration to argue that opening markets and stimulating greater consumption would be in Japan ' s own interest . &quot; Because the economy is weak , 100 yen ought to buy as much as possible , &quot; one White_House official said . Cutter said he felt officials in Tokyo could end the practice by which Japanese companies charge higher prices for goods at_home than they do overseas . &quot; They can do what we did_in America from 1945 to 1955 , which is to feed consumer demand . They could do that and still come_out of this with a savings rate which is 50 % higher than ours. &quot; The strengthened American economy would appear to give the United States greater leverage than before in dealing with Tokyo . But some American critics believe the Administration policy is doomed to failure because Japan has no intention of changing the way it does business . &quot; The Japanese are playing hardball economic warfare , and the people in Washington aren ' t prepared_for it , &quot; said UC San Diego professor Chalmers Johnson . &quot; Hosokawa is giving the illusion of change . But the truth is that the Japanese are buying time. &quot; Johnson argued that Japan ' s long-term strategy is to integrate its economy with the rest of Asia , buying low-technology goods from its neighbors and feeding the fast-growing demand in places like China and Southeast_Asia . &quot; The Americans don ' t have the same leverage as in the past , &quot; Johnson said . Administration policy , however , remains based on the premise that Japan can and will change . &quot; Our goal is a Japan that is truly integrated into the world economy , &quot; one senior U.S. official said . &quot; We want a Japanese economy that responds like a normal economy -- so that , for example , if the exchange_rates go_down , people in Japan buy more imports. &quot; What happens if the Administration fails , and Japan ' s economy doesn ' t change in the way that Clinton and his aides are hoping ? &quot; It ' s not that we will suddenly declare economic warfare , &quot; Cutter said . &quot; But the current direction ( of economic relations ) has been corrosive , and it will get more so. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think it would be hard to build an anti-Japanese groundswell in the consumer sector here , &quot; another Administration official said . &quot; Our population believes Japan doesn ' t play by the same rules . Our corporations are tired_of it. &quot;</TEXT>
