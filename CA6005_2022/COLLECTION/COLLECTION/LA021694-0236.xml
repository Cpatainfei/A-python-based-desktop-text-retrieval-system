   <HEADLINE> VERDICT ON ICE ? ; SKATING JUDGE SAYS FOCUS_ON PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tonya Harding vs . Nancy Kerrigan . In the minds of many , it ' s villainess vs . victim . But what about the minds of the only people who really matter , those who will judge them on the ice in the figure_skating competition at the Winter_Olympics . Can the judges totally block_out the constant barrage of information about the attack on Kerrigan , which has bombarded them from every media outlet , and fairly assess these two skaters and the other competitors solely on the basis of their performances ? Absolutely without reservation , according to Margaret Anne Wier of Park City , Utah , who will be the lone U.S. judge in the women ' s figure_skating competition starting next Wednesday at Lillehammer , Norway . &quot; When I ' m judging , I ' m focusing in on the skater , &quot; Wier said . &quot; I cannot think_of the publicity or where they placed before . I have to focus in on what they did that day . Judges are very open-minded. &quot; They can ' t afford not to be . &quot; We can ' t be out of line and be too high or too low , &quot; Wier said , &quot; or we ' ll be called_on the carpet. &quot; The result of biased judging could be probation or outright expulsion . Wier , who skated on three world teams in the 1950s and was a substitute judge in the 1992 Winter Games at Albertville , France , will depart for Norway today . &quot; I have to do my job , &quot; she said . &quot; I can ' t let anything affect me . I have heard everything everybody else has heard , but I will have to put it all out of my mind . &quot; We ' re used to pressure , just like the skaters . It ' s not always easy , but we ' ll do our job. &quot; STEVE SPRINGER</TEXT>
