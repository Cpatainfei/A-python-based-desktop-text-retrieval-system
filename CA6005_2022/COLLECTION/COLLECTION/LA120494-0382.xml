   <HEADLINE> SERBS BREAK VOW , WON ' T FREE CAPTIVES ; BALKANS : RESUMPTION OF SOME NATO PATROL FLIGHTS BRINGS RENEWED THREAT FROM BOSNIAN REBEL LEADER . PLANS TO WITHDRAW PEACEKEEPERS ARE ' QUITE ADVANCED , ' U.N. CHIEF SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a display of contempt for the international peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Serbian nationalists on Saturday reneged_on a public promise to release 400 U.N. troops held hostage as insurance against NATO air strikes . Bosnian Serb rebel leader Radovan Karadzic made the vow to the U.N. special envoy to the Balkans , Yasushi Akashi , on Friday . But Saturday his rebels refused even to free one U.N. military observer suffering a heart_condition and in need of urgent medical treatment unless the U.N. mission substituted another captive in his place , U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said . The U.N. headquarters here rejected the proposed hostage swap as &quot; totally unacceptable , &quot; Risley said . &quot; We are hoping to impress on the Bosnian Serbs the seriousness with which we take the situation. &quot; The empty promise of freedom for detained peacekeepers came_on the heels of Friday ' s jarring provocation of the U.N. Protection Force -- the rocketing of a Sarajevo building while Akashi and the U.N. commander for Bosnia were inside . Karadzic also reiterated a subtle warning that his gunmen might shoot_down NATO warplanes after the alliance resumed a_few &quot; trial_balloon &quot; flights Saturday to symbolically monitor the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone proclaimed two years ago but violated daily . The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization had ceased air patrols six days earlier at U.N. insistence that a &quot; cooling-off period &quot; be observed to lure the rebels back to negotiations . A U.N. military spokesman told reporters in Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serbs had been advised that the patrols should not be interpreted as hostile action . The spokesman said that &quot; Karadzic responded by laying_out his position that there was no reason for overflights and insisting on the Serbs ' right of self-defense. &quot; Asked if U.N. officials have concluded that the rebels are trying to drive them out , Risley replied : &quot; Certainly. &quot; &quot; It ' s clear the Bosnian Serbs are testing the resolve of the international community on ( the U.N. Protection Force ) , &quot; he said , adding that pressures are mounting daily for a U.N. pullout . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali conceded in Geneva that contingency plans for a withdrawal are &quot; quite advanced , &quot; the strongest indication to date that the mission ' s directors might be leaning toward retreat . A decision to bring an end to the now-fruitless mission that began in Croatia three years ago would require a vote of the U.N. Security_Council ; debate over such an action would probably take weeks . But mission officials warned that a piecemeal pullout is the more likely scenario for scuttling the mission , with individual troop-contributing countries evacuating on short notice and perhaps bringing a chaotic , deadly and humiliating end to the world ' s failed attempt at neutral intervention . The 24 # 000 U.N. troops in Bosnia -- more_than half of the peacekeeping force deployed across the roiling Balkans -- come from 23 countries , the vast majority of them U.S. allies in NATO . &quot; Britain , France , Canada and Spain have all indicated in recent days , if not weeks , their desire to withdraw if conditions continue to deteriorate , &quot; Risley said . France has already reduced its presence in Bosnia with the pullout in September of its battalion in the Bihac pocket . The area is now the focus of a fierce Serbian rebel offensive despite the presence of 1 # 200 U.N. troops from Bangladesh . Bosnian Serbs and their Croatian Serb allies continued attacking the U.N.-designated &quot; safe haven &quot; of Bihac city and edged close to capture of the town of Velika Kladusa to the north , Risley reported Saturday . Croatian Serb troops from the occupied Krajina region and armed supporters of a deposed Bosnian Muslim warlord , Fikret Abdic , moved deep into the territory defended by the Bosnian army ' s outgunned 5th Corps . The Muslim-led government troops were pushed close to surrender , raising fears that the incursion was aimed at making Abdic a Serbian quisling ruler over the region . Observers said the international community might find reinstating Abdic , a Muslim , a face-saving alternative to an outright takeover by the Karadzic forces . Violations of U.N. resolutions throughout Bosnia persisted despite Akashi ' s assurances to Karadzic during a weekend trip to the rebel stronghold of Pale that the mission would refrain_from using NATO air_power , U.N. sources said . NATO patrolling of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia had been called_off for the past week in an effort to appease the rebels , U.N. and alliance officials disclosed Friday . &quot; There is no reason in the world right now to suspend NATO action . NATO has to be thinking that its reputation is_on the line , &quot; one U.N. official here said . &quot; I would hate to think a bunch of thugs in Pale had succeeded in standing down the strongest military alliance that has ever existed. &quot; The Serbs ' threats against NATO warplanes after the overflights resumed Saturday raised serious doubts about the United Nations ' ability to operate humanitarian airlifts into Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital that is under siege by the Serbian rebels . And there was no word that a Serbian blockade of U.N. aid convoys to besieged Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia had been lifted , as Bosnian Serb leaders had promised Akashi on Friday . The international community is currently trying to settle the Bosnian conflict diplomatically , with a watered-down proposal for ethnic division that the Bosnian Serbs have already rejected . The five-nation Contact Group , as it is known , decided during its meeting in Brussels on Friday to resurrect the plan for splitting Bosnian territory in half between the internationally recognized government and the Karadzic faction . The Serbian rebels currently occupy more_than 70 % of Bosnian land . Karadzic has insisted on more territory and a larger share of major utilities and industrial resources . &quot; There ' s no carrots and no sticks . It ' s yesterday ' s failure , &quot; said one U.N. official , baffled by the Contact Group ' s resubmission of the rejected plan . The foreign_ministers of Britain and France -- partners in the Contact Group with the United States , Russia and Germany -- planned to visit Belgrade today for talks with the reputed mastermind of the Balkan conflict , Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic . It remained unclear to U.N. and diplomatic sources what inducements British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd and his French counterpart , Alain Juppe , could deliver , especially through Milosevic , who has ostensibly split with the Karadzic faction he armed and instigated . Russia has been pushing for a lifting of U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Belgrade for fomenting the Bosnia war as encouragement to Milosevic to use his influence with the Bosnian Serb rebels . That strategy was defeated by the Western allies , however , and Russia ' s veto of a routine sanctions resolution in the Security_Council on Friday was unlikely to enhance its chances of rewarding Milosevic for token compliance or foster unity within the divided Contact Group .</TEXT>
