   <HEADLINE> HULKING MAMMALS AND HIGH_TECHNOLOGY ARE JUST THE BEGINNING ; A WHALE OF A FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the second year running , the information superhighway will take a temporary detour through the Dana Point Festival of Whales , giving event-goers a chance to link up electronically with a scientist working in another part of the globe . At last year ' s festival , researchers working in Biosphere 2 conversed via video teleconferences with students and other visitors . The Arizona project , which ended last year , had put a team of scientists in a sealed , self-contained microcosm of Earth for two years . On Friday , opening day for this year ' s festival , the Cousteau Society sponsors a program at Dana Hills High_School in which participants will be able to ask questions of geophysicist Robert Ballard as he works_on a project in Belize , Central_America . Also on Friday ' s program , Peter Burtchell of the Cousteau Society will talk_about &quot; Threats to Our Global Oceans. &quot; Ballard ' s video satellite hookups will continue during the week , as he tells students and other festival-goers about the Jason Project , an ongoing science program set this year in Belize . Ballard is probably most famous for his discovery of the sunken ocean_liner Titanic . The Ballard teleconferences are just one aspect of the festival , which continues to expand every year . Also offered will be programs set aboard the sailing_ship Pilgrim at the Orange County Marine Institute , sand sculpture workshops and a contest , children ' s events and activities , a symphony concert , tide-pool tours , a parade , a &quot; Street Faire &quot; and an appearance by popular marine life painter Wyland . There are athletic_contests as well , including a quick but grueling bike climb_up Cove Road from the harbor , a long board surfing contest , a 5K run , a volleyball tournament and a sea kayaking clinic . And , of course , there are whales -- Pacific gray_whales migrating just beyond the Dana Point Headlands as they make their way south to breeding grounds along the coast of Mexico . This is being called a particularly strong whale season , with multiple sightings on almost every trip_out of Dana Point . Whale-watch excursions are offered by Dana Wharf Sportfishing and by the Marine Institute . Whale-watching provided the original impetus for the festival , which began in 1972 , but in recent years it has gained a broader focus . &quot; When ( the festival ) first started , it was an educational_program only , offered through the schools , &quot; said Jody Tyson , executive_director of the Dana Point Chamber_of_Commerce , sponsors of the event for the past several years . &quot; Every year , hopefully , it gets bigger and better . This should be our biggest so far. &quot; The festival has grown from being a celebration of the whale to showcasing the entire marine environment . Even with nature documentaries and books , Tyson said , there is no better way to learn and appreciate than to experience the environment firsthand . &quot; If they have a chance to come_down here to walk through the tide pools , to touch an anchovy , to see a gull or just smell the salt air , it can really come_alive , &quot; Tyson said . As in past years , the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point Harbor will be a center of activity , with tide-pool tours and other programs about marine life , whale-watch excursions , and programs aboard the brig Pilgrim , a sailing_ship outfitted like those of the 19th Century . &quot; The Arts of the Sailor &quot; will give visitors a chance to &quot; learn what it was like to be a sailor back in the days of the sailing_ships , &quot; said Dan Stetson , associate executive_director of the institute . &quot; We want to show what it was like to be in the whaling industry in those days and contrast it to what ( it ' s ) like today. &quot; The marine institute is also involved in the Jason Project , a national effort now in its fifth year &quot; to improve student interest in science , &quot; said Stan Cummings , executive_director of the institute . Every year , students at about 30 locations in the United States and Canada are hooked_up via satellite with scientists working in some part of the globe . This year , the two-week project happens to fall during the Festival of Whales , so the satellite sessions will also be open_to the general public . Selected students and other audience members will be able to ask questions of Ballard and even operate remote cameras . Ballard ' s main specialty has been mapping the ocean_floor ; the program will focus_on both the rain_forest and on the coral_reefs off Belize , the largest reef system in the Western_Hemisphere . In Dana Point at the Edwards Ocean Ranch Village cinema , the program will be held Monday through Saturday , Feb . 28 , to March 5 and March 7 through 12 , four times daily : 8:30 , 10 and 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Some seats will be set_aside for the public at each showing , particularly on Saturdays . Beyond its educational facets , there are some down-home community aspects of the Festival of Whales as well , such_as Saturday ' s opening parade , a one-mile line of local marching bands and waving politicians that will end at La Plaza Park , site of the street fair . &quot; It ' s a little hometown parade , &quot; Tyson said . &quot; It gets the entire community out. &quot; The street fair , which will continue for both weekends of the festival , will include more_than 100 booths featuring food and crafts , in addition to a petting zoo . Musical entertainment will range from Big Band to surf rock . Festival of Whales Following is a schedule of events for Dana Point ' s 23rd Festival of Whales .
