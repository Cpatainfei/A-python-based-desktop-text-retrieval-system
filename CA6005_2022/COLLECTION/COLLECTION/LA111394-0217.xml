   <TEXT> The sight of a toddler blowing a storm of bubbles while ignoring a doctor who was inserting a needle in her arm sent a ripple of laughter Saturday through an audience of Orange County nurses and physicians who watched the procedure on videotape . Encouraging children to blow bubbles is part of a broad arsenal of medical and non-medical methods , including narcotic-laced lollipops , self-hypnosis or simply the company of a friendly dog , that are being used to help youngsters cope_with pain . About 80 medical professionals gathered at an all-day conference at the Atrium Marquis Hotel in Irvine to learn about the latest in pain control and the need for increasing attention to pediatric pain -- the extent of which has only been acknowledged within the last decade by national associations of pediatricians and anesthesiologists . &quot; Up until fairly recently , there were major pediatric centers in the country that did major_surgery on newborns with little or no anesthesia , &quot; said Dr. Robert Truog , associate_professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at Harvard Medical_School and one of the conference speakers . There is now sufficient scientific evidence , the speakers said , to firmly disprove the once widespread belief that newborns cannot feel pain or that painkillers are too dangerous to administer to children . &quot; In most cases there is good evidence now that pain control promotes healing , &quot; said Truog . The pain of newborns has been most neglected in part because physicians have had difficulty assessing their suffering , said Dr. Robert Wilder , director of the Pain Treatment Center at Children ' s Hospital in Boston . After all , infants can ' t speak_up , and a baby ' s crying can be misinterpreted as a call_for food or attention . But Wilder said research shows that a reliable indicator of an infant ' s pain is facial_expression , such_as a grimacing mouth and a furrowed brow . &quot; Around the country , still half of the circumcisions are done without any anesthesia or pain medication , &quot; he said . Several speakers said improvements in the management of pediatric pain from illnesses and medical treatments will ultimately be brought_about by the demands of parents . &quot; There will be parents who will take this as a battle_cry and go_to bat for their children , &quot; said Leora Kuttner , a clinical_psychologist and assistant_professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of British_Columbia . Kuttner said parents are getting more involved in all aspects of the hospital_care of their children . &quot; Whereas parents 20 years ago would drop the children in the ward and come only during visiting time , now they are often staying_at their children ' s bedside , &quot; she said . The presence of a parent comforts a child , Kuttner said . During a painful procedure , she said , a parent can hold the child ' s hand , tell stories or lead the child in taking deep , rhythmic breaths , all_of which can be pain relieving . And being with the child , Kuttner added , gives the parent an opportunity to act_as the child ' s advocate . Dr. Robert L . Manniello , medical director of Children ' s Hospital of Orange County , said the hospital ' s staff is in the process of upgrading its pain management program in response to complaints received from parents and nurses . A survey of the hospital ' s 600 staff physicians found that many physicians , including surgeons , didn ' t understand the importance of treating pain in children or know the most current pain control methods , Manniello said . Saturday ' s conference was organized by CHOC with a $ 6 # 000 grant from Abbott Laboratories . Manniello said the program is a first_step toward better educating nurses and doctors . About half of those who attended the conference were CHOC staff_members . In addition , he said , the hospital is creating a pain management team that includes nurses , pediatric surgeons , and pediatric physicians and will set policies and procedures for pain management in every department . CHOC already has tried some innovations , Manniello said , including the introduction this year of a pet therapy program . Manniello told about David , a 10-year-old who died of cystic_fibrosis at the hospital several weeks ago . In one of David ' s last coherent moments , he received a visit from a German_shepherd named Becks that he had come_to love . &quot; David opened his eyes , and the dog came_up and barked to say hello , and David petted him , &quot; Manniello said . &quot; It gave David five minutes away from his pain and anguish . At that point , the pain was gone. &quot; PEDIATRICS</TEXT>
