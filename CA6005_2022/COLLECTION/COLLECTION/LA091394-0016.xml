   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON NORTHERN_IRELAND ; DON ' T RUSH IN AND TIP THE SCALES ; THE IRA CEASE-FIRE OFFERS DIPLOMATIC OPENINGS , BUT THE UNITED STATES MUST BEWARE OF FUELING THE FEARS OF LOYALISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A unilateral cease-fire is a curious thing . Why are the Republicans in Northern_Ireland willing to lay_down their weapons after such a long fight ? The cease-fire announced by the_Irish Republican Army on Aug . 30 reflects a shift in the balance_of_power . Although some believe that the Republicans are capitulating in the face of insurmountable odds , it appears , instead , that the winds of diplomacy are gradually shifting in their favor . One look_at the Protestant response to the declaration indicates that those who lived perhaps most directly in fear of the IRA violence are not celebrating the lifting of that weight . On the contrary , Loyalists , both militant and mainstream , fear this turn of events because it signifies a closer relationship between the_British and the Republicans . They believe something significant must have happened behind their backs in_order for the Republicans to concede to meeting the_British government ' s criteria for negotiation . As the_British open_up formal lines of communication with the Republicans , the Loyalists increasingly fear that the_British will sell them out , either by leaving them stranded on the island to fend_for themselves or by forcing them into a union with Ireland where they will lose their freedoms , status and identity . However accurate or inaccurate an estimation of British intentions those impressions are ( and there is some evidence that British commitment , both popular and governmental , to maintaining a presence in Northern_Ireland is weakening ) , they are the reigning perceptions of Loyalists and their leaders such_as Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux . These perceptions are important to keep_in mind as Americans and the Clinton_Administration respond to this new turn of events . Although the declaration of a cease-fire opens_up many U.S. diplomatic opportunities , we must be extremely careful about interfering in a very delicate balance_of_power that holds many lives at stake . The Clinton_Administration has been quick to claim credit for the declaration , citing the visas granted in the last few months to Joseph Cahill , Patrick Treanor and Gerry Adams as evidence of the U.S. involvement in the shifting balance in Northern Irish politics . Loyalists do not see the U.S. role in the same light . They are already suspicious of the United States for its refusal to extradite suspected Republican terrorists to Britain and for American support for Noraid ( the U.S. fund-raising group that aids families of prisoners caught_up in Northern_Ireland strife , also suspected of funding the IRA ) . And they are already compromised by the improving relationship between Britain and Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political wing . Thus Loyalists feel that the United States is acting to destroy them , directly or indirectly . Pushing them too far may result in a Unionist backlash that would cripple the peace process . Because all sides must be party to a lasting peace , the United States should be wary of ruining the progress made in getting the Republicans to sit_down at the table by scaring_off the Unionists . As hard as it is to accept , American solutions to the conflict are not Irish solutions , and imposing our will upon other sovereign peoples is neither good diplomacy for us nor true reconciliation for the_Irish . After all , as 600 years of conflict on the island of Ireland should have taught us , what Ireland needs is less foreign interference , not more .</TEXT>
