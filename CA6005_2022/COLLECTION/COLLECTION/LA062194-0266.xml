   <HEADLINE> ABUSED CHILDREN STAYING LONGER IN O.C. SHELTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Orangewood Children ' s Home has to shelter abused children almost twice as long as it did a decade ago , creating severe overcrowding conditions at the 263-bed facility , a new county study has found . And most of the children being sheltered there for two months or more suffer from such severe problems that it ' s nearly impossible to find foster_homes for them , according to a Social_Services Agency report released Monday . In an effort to address the overcrowding problem , Orange County Supervisor William G . Steiner asked the Social_Services Agency to conduct a comprehensive study of factors affecting the length of time that children typically spend there . The situation has become so dire in recent years that the staff at the children ' s home has been forced at times to scramble just to find enough cots and cribs for the children . The chronic overcrowding reflects the rapid increase in child_abuse reports , which doubled between 1985 and 1993 to nearly 37 # 000 reported cases , according to the agency . &quot; We feel_like we ' re walking on a tightrope , &quot; Steiner said Monday . &quot; What we are talking_about today is probably the tip of the iceberg. &quot; According to the study , 263 substance-addicted babies were admitted to Orangewood in 1993 -- a dramatic increase over previous years , says Steiner , formerly Orangewood director . The study further found that 500 of the 2 # 452 children admitted in 1992 remained in the county-run shelter for more_than two months because social_workers could not find a relative , foster or group home to take them . One in five of these children was described as suicidal , 20 % were taking medication for mental_illness , 12 % had been hospitalized in a mental_institution and half had a variety of medical problems resulting from cigarette_burns , beatings , sexual molestation and general neglect . &quot; . . . The children coming_into Orangewood in recent years are more and more disturbed , difficult , behaviorally aggressive &quot; and &quot; out of control , &quot; the report stated . &quot; Some fail placement after placement and ' burn_out ' all_of the placement resources. &quot; They include children such_as a 15-year-old girl from Tustin who found herself a reluctant guest at Orangewood when her stepfather was arrested for the double murder of her mother and a step-sibling two years ago . According to social_workers , the girl steals , skips school , runs_away and sometimes threatens suicide . Social_services officials have tried to place her with foster_parents four times . But on each occasion she has been sent_back to Orangewood because of severe behavioral problems . The study further concluded that one quarter of the children who remain at Orangewood longer than 60 days belong in the juvenile justice system , but there is no room for them because the available programs are already swamped with hard-core teen-age offenders . The study detailed a variety of factors that often delay the placement of children in foster_homes -- increasing the time that they must spend at Orangewood . Half of the children in Orangewood have siblings there , while 16 % belong_to families having three to seven children . Since social_workers try to keep children together whenever possible , larger families pose difficulties . Meanwhile , the numbers of Latino children requiring placement have doubled in six years . They now number 36 % of the children at Orangewood . However , only 12 % of foster_homes have Latino-surnamed parents , and not all_of those foster_parents are fluent in Spanish . At the same time , the number of licensed foster care beds has decreased 22 % in six years . Group home beds in Orange County are also in short supply , with the result that 26 % of the children have to be placed out of the county . But Orangewood Director Bob Theemling says having the same number of beds as there are needy children is not enough . &quot; It ' s not easy to find the right match , &quot; Theemling said . &quot; And to find the best match you can , you need to have choices -- at least twice as_many beds as children. &quot; The study offered a variety of recommendations for combatting the problem of overcrowding . They included : * Launching an aggressive recruitment program for foster_parents . * Providing additional resources for adoption when it is unlikely that children will be reunited with their natural parents . * Refocusing efforts and resources on outreach programs to prevent child_abuse . Social_Services officials said they plan to ask the county for $ 350 # 000 to use for foster_parent recruitment . The study ' s findings were praised by children ' s advocates who have long argued that the county should channel more money into anti-poverty programs rather than expand the current Orangewood facility . In 1978 , the county spent $ 4 million to expand Orangewood . The study found , however , that the average stay has doubled since then -- all but negating the effect of the extra beds . &quot; This is something that we ' ve been pushing for a long while , &quot; said Sandy Sladen , director of community services for the Children ' s Bureau of Southern California . &quot; The best way to prevent child_abuse is to teach people to be good parents so their children are never abused and they never see the inside of Orangewood. &quot; The nonprofit agency was recently awarded a $ 450 # 000 grant over three years to launch a program to help combat child_abuse . The program is one of six funded by the state_Department of Social_Services . &quot; I think in the past , we ' ve been so overwhelmed by responding to the pain of child_abuse that we haven ' t focused attention on what causes child_abuse in the first place , &quot; Sladen said . &quot; I think now we ' re getting the first movement in that direction. &quot; Barbara Oliver , director of the Orange County Child_Abuse Prevention Council , agreed : &quot; In terms of the work we do , it ' s clear that what we really need to focus_on is early intervention to help preserve families. &quot; Judy Nelson , the executive_director of the Orangewood Children ' s Foundation , also stressed what many called a changing approach to dealing with_child abuse . &quot; What we did for many years was raise money to build Orangewood , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; But putting an Orangewood on every corner would n ' t be enough . To prevent the abuse , you need to teach people about child abuse. &quot; Longer Stays_at Orangewood Children with severe emotional , physical and behavioral problems are staying longer than the usual 60 days at Orangewood Children ' s Home . The average stay has doubled in the past 15 years . In 1992 : * About 500 children out of 2 # 452 admitted stayed longer than 60 days . * One in five was suicidal and on psychiatric medication . * Twelve percent had a history of being hospitalized for psychiatric reasons . * Nearly one-third were aggressive or violent with this behavior shown at a younger age . * Half had a variety of medical problems . * One-fourth of those who stayed longer than 60 days belonged in the juvenile justice system , but stayed_put because there was no room in Juvenile Hall .
