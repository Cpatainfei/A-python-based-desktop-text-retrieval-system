   <HEADLINE> TRASH : WALNUT ' S OPPOSITION TO RECOVERY FACILITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walnut residents are opposed to the Material Recovery Facility ( MRF ) being proposed by the City of Industry at the corner of Grand ( Avenue ) and Valley ( Boulevard ) . Walnut is surrounded on the west by the BKK Landfill and on the east by the Spadra Landfill.We believe a &quot; fair share &quot; approach should be made to siting trash facilities . Industry ' s draft environmental impact report says Industry needs capacity to handle 600 tons of trash per day , but the MRF would handle 5 # 700 tons per day , generate up_to 3 # 444 vehicles per day and add 500 tons of pollutants into the air each day . The draft environmental impact report says the MRF would have 35 &quot; significant &quot; and &quot; unavoidable &quot; environmental impacts that &quot; cannot be mitigated. &quot; Walnut is opposed to such a massive regional facility next to homes . Walnut has asked Industry to reduce the size and relocate its MRF to an industrial area away from homes . To date , Industry has not responded to Walnut in any manner . The Walnut City_Council established a citizens task_force to lead the community ' s opposition to this MRF , and the city has budgeted $ 334 # 000 at this time , including more_than $ 200 # 000 for special legal counsel , to oppose the MRF as it is currently planned . Walnut will continue to vigorously and vehemently oppose this project by all legal means in_order to protect the health and safety of our residents . BERT ASHLEY Walnut mayor</TEXT>
