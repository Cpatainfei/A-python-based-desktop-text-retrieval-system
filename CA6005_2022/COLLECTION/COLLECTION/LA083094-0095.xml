   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON JUDGE MOVES TO CONTROL INFORMATION ; COURTS : ITO PROPOSES BARRING ALL INVOLVED FROM PUBLICLY DISCUSSING EVIDENCE , DOCUMENTS . HE THREATENS SANCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the murder trial of O.J. Simpson scheduled to begin in three weeks , Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito took aggressive steps Monday to control information in the case , distributing a proposed order that would halt everyone connected with the investigation from publicly discussing evidence , documents or exhibits . Although Ito declined to release his proposed order to the media , a copy reviewed by The Times makes_it clear that he is angry about the continuing disclosure of information . In his proposed order , Ito cites two recent news_reports in which evidence purportedly was disclosed , and he says he will bar any person connected to the case from leaking more information . &quot; A trial_court not only has the authority but the affirmative duty to protect the right to a fair trial , &quot; Ito wrote . &quot; In order to fulfill this duty , given the amount of media interest and coverage this case has ignited , the court must use its inherent authority to control the judicial proceedings. &quot; Any violation of his order , Ito wrote , &quot; will incur sanctions. &quot; He did not specify what the sanctions would be , but cited three California code sections that lay out some possible punishments . The sanctions include fining violators or holding them in contempt . Ito also suggested in the proposed order that the Simpson case might be cause to &quot; reconsider the wisdom &quot; of rules that allow cameras and recording devices in courtrooms . As part of his authority to control the court proceedings and to ensure a fair trial , Ito said in his proposed order that he wants all motions in the case to be filed under seal , adding that he would only release those documents when they are argued in open court . He had already imposed that requirement during a closed-door session with attorneys last week . Ito is expected to hear arguments on the proposed order Wednesday and may finalize it then . Some legal_experts commended him for trying to gain control of the high-publicity case , but others said his move to seal all motions was objectionable and might be challenged by an appellate_court . &quot; That seems pretty excessive , &quot; said Paul Hoffman , a Santa Monica criminal attorney . &quot; I ' ve been through the ropes on this many times , and I ' ve never seen a judge try to say that every motion should be filed under seal. &quot; Ramona Ripston , executive_director of the Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union , agreed . &quot; It ' s wrong , &quot; she said of Ito ' s proposed order . &quot; I don ' t remember any judge imposing such a blanket gag order . It not only serves no purpose , it hurts the process . . . . I think in cases like this the public understanding of the court system is important. &quot; The immediate impact of Ito ' s new clampdown on the release of legal pleadings was to prevent the disclosure of two important motions in the Simpson case filed Monday by the football Hall of Famer ' s battery of attorneys . One of those motions seeks dismissal of the case by arguing that the evidence presented during the preliminary hearing was insufficient , and the other asks that evidence seized during a search of Simpson ' s home be excluded if the case goes_to trial , because police_officers acted improperly in gathering it . The conduct of officers in the search is one of several issues that Simpson ' s attorneys are contesting as they assert their client ' s innocence . He is charged with the murders of Ronald Lyle Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson , whose bloody bodies were found just after midnight June 12 . The hearing Monday morning represented the most aggressive attack yet on the integrity of the investigating officers in the case and is the latest signal of the defense ' s intent to challenge virtually every aspect of the proceedings against Simpson . In the motion heard Monday , defense_attorneys sought personnel records and other documents detailing the backgrounds of four key detectives in the case -- Philip L . Vannatter , Tom Lange , Ronald Phillips and Mark Fuhrman . Vannatter and Lange are the lead investigators , and Phillips and Fuhrman were the first two detectives assigned to the case . Defense_attorneys are seeking any complaints filed against the officers and other material related to their LAPD performance . But most of the argument Monday centered around Fuhrman , who said he found a bloody glove outside Simpson ' s Brentwood estate a_few hours after the bodies were discovered . In addition to Fuhrman ' s personnel records , defense_attorneys are seeking access to his Marine Corps file . Members of Simpson ' s defense camp have accused Fuhrman of being a racist and of planting evidence in a previous case that involved an African American man shot by LAPD officers . They also have suggested that Fuhrman might have planted the glove in the Simpson case to be hailed for solving the crime . Law_enforcement sources said LAPD officials have conducted an internal inquiry to find_out if Fuhrman could have taken a glove from the murder scene unnoticed and carried it to Simpson ' s house , as defense sources have alleged . The LAPD has concluded it would have been virtually impossible for that to happen , in part because 14 officers were at the scene and had secured it by the time Fuhrman arrived . Defense_attorneys did not directly raise the issue of planting the glove Monday , and they carefully broached the topic of Fuhrman ' s alleged racism , eager to avoid accusations that they are injecting race into the already volatile case . Instead , they said their accusations are solely based on public documents and a sworn declaration taken earlier this month from a woman who said she met Fuhrman in 1985 or 1986 . &quot; It is not and has not been defense counsel who have created reports reflecting that Mr. Fuhrman is a malingerer willing to twist the truth for his own personal benefit . that ' s in the reports , &quot; said Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys . &quot; It was not us who discussed Mr. Fuhrman ' s alleged repugnant attitudes toward people_of_color . that ' s in those reports. &quot; But Cochran was met with a furious response from Fuhrman ' s lawyer , Robert H . Tourtelot , who accused Simpson ' s attorneys of making_up allegations against his client and asked Ito to sanction them for their comments . Tourtelot said Fuhrman ' s right_of_privacy was being invaded by &quot; desperate , snooping defense_attorneys &quot; using &quot; truth-be-damned tactics &quot; to discredit an honest police_detective . &quot; I ' m outraged , &quot; Tourtelot said . &quot; I ' m absolutely outraged by these defense tactics . . . . I don ' t believe the defense should be permitted to get_away with it. &quot; Tourtelot denied that Fuhrman is a racist or that he made racially inflammatory comments attributed to him . In connection with a 1983 pension case , Fuhrman allegedly told a psychiatrist he was frustrated by minorities and preoccupied with violence . And a real_estate_agent named Kathleen Bell said in a recent sworn declaration that Fuhrman told her in 1985 or 1986 that he intentionally pulled over interracial couples when he spotted them in cars . Tourtelot said the comments in the pension case were taken_out of context . And he flatly denied that Fuhrman ever spoke with Bell or said the things she attributed to him . &quot; The only people calling_Mark a racist are these attorneys for the defense , &quot; Tourtelot said . &quot; We ' re going to fight_back . By the time of the trial in this case , the entire world will know that Mark is not a racist. &quot; Ito did not rule on the defense request for the officers ' records , but his comments from the bench suggested that he is likely to grant it at least partially . If he does , the LAPD would first be required to turn_over certain records to him , which Ito would then review to decide which , if any , should be shared with defense_lawyers . Because they are personnel records , the attorneys would be prohibited from discussing anything in the documents with reporters . As the case moves closer to trial , Ito is waging a determined campaign to halt disclosure of information in the media . He was angered earlier this month when Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys , sent news organizations copies of a letter to the court . Because it was filed late in the day , Ito first learned of the letter while listening to the radio . Later , prosecutors filed a motion disclosing that DNA tests being conducted in a Maryland laboratory reaffirmed earlier DNA tests showing that blood from the crime scene contains some genetic markers identical to Simpson ' s blood . Ito called Shapiro and Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark into his chambers Aug . 22 to voice his concerns and , sources said , to instruct them to file future motions under seal . Defense_attorneys said Monday that they had not understood that requirement and filed a motion Thursday that was not under seal . But Monday , after Ito gave them copies of his proposed order , they said they welcomed it . &quot; We agree with all_the court ' s comments in your protective order and agree that it ' s long overdue , &quot; Shapiro said in court . &quot; Our understandings are the same , and that procedure will be followed. &quot; In his proposed order , Ito cited two stories last week as having been particularly irritating . One involved reports by The Times and KNBC-TV that microscopic analysis determined that the hairs from a knit cap found at the crime scene resembled Simpson ' s hair . The second was a broadcast report indicating that the item in a mysterious envelope displayed in court during the preliminary hearing is said to be a knife . Ironically , that information was first reported more_than a month ago , though last week ' s story added that the knife &quot; has been tested , was undamaged and still has a price_tag on it , &quot; Ito said in his proposed protective order . The judge did not say whether either of the reports was accurate . That envelope has never been opened , but Ito said Monday that he intended to disclose the contents during a hearing Wednesday . Simpson ' s lawyers seemed surprised by that announcement , and told Ito that they would file a motion dealing with how the envelope and its contents should be handled . &quot; All right , &quot; Ito responded . &quot; But I ' m indicating to you that I would like to resolve the discovery issues on the 31st. &quot; Ito invited attorneys involved in the case to respond to his proposed protective order today before he finalizes it . He has scheduled a hearing on the issue for Wednesday . Legal analysts were divided on the question of whether Ito is right to impose a strict gag order and to limit public disclosure of motions in the case . Ito ' s proposed order is far broader than one briefly imposed by the federal judge in the Rodney G . King civil_rights case , which went_to trial amid enormous publicity . Still , Robert A . Pugsley , a law professor at Southwestern University , said the proposed order is consistent with constitutional requirements &quot; given the hemorrhaging that has occurred in this case. &quot; Others , however , said the proposed order probably is illegal and ultimately will be ineffective . Blocking the release of motions will only force journalists to turn increasingly to anonymous sources on both sides of the case , said attorney Hoffman . Harland W . Braun , a criminal defense_attorney who was briefly subjected_to a gag order during the King trial , noted that he had successfully contested that gag order . Braun predicted that Ito ' s efforts to control information about this case also would fail .</TEXT>
