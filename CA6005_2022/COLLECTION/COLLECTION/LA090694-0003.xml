   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN , CUBAN IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Your Aug . 27 editorial claims that Gov . Pete Wilson ' s analogy regarding President Clinton ' s attitude toward Cuban refugees versus illegal immigration from Mexico &quot; doesn ' t wash &quot; ! Have we changed our foreign_policy to favor the acceptance of illegal immigrants because they need a job over the acceptance of an immigrant who escapes_from an oppressive regime ? ARNOLD FRIEDMAN Beverly Hills * &quot; Border Brouhaha &quot; once again exposes your anti-Republican stance and superficial treatment of a vital issue for the future of California . Illegal immigration and protection of our national borders are a federal obligation , which are not only virtually ignored , but the costs of providing_for these illegals are shoved_off on the states . Next you opine that Wilson does not acknowledge that Californians use illegal immigrants for cheap labor . We passed a law creating sanctions on employers who knowingly employ illegals ; however , the reason this does not work is that anyone can obtain a forged green_card , Social_Security card or other ID in 20 minutes , as a recent TV expose revealed , but no federal_government action ! If the illegals were prevented from coming here , perhaps some of our lazy unemployed might be pushed to work instead of just living_off unemployment benefits . I am not an employer , so have no bone to pick in this regard , but merely an overtaxed individual who migrated to this great country and state 45 years ago , having to wait for a quota opening , prove financial capability and also undergo a severe medical_exam and , oh yes , was drafted while I still wasn ' t a citizen and served in the U.S. Army . Illegal immigration is not a state obligation but definitely a federal one . I can only feel that the federal inaction is_due to some tacit agreement between the U.S. and Mexican governments to relieve pressure on Mexico due_to overpopulation . FRED NEWMAN Marina del Rey * Your editorial attacked the messenger , Gov . Wilson , not the real problem . The problem is the corruption in Mexico and the lack of political will of the Mexican people ! It is easy for illegal aliens to picket office_buildings in Century City in an effort to gain every economic benefit that they can squeeze_out of this country . It would take courage for these same people to picket government_offices in Mexico to protest the political , military and police corruption that is so prevalent ! LAURENCE F . ALMOND Los Angeles * I urge all legal immigrants and naturalized citizens to stand with your undocumented brothers and sisters and vote no on Prop . 187 . You may want to distance yourselves from the powerless illegals and tell yourself that you have nothing in common . But I tell you that should Prop . 187 pass , you will be next . All laws can be changed . This initiative has nothing to do with legal and illegal , and everything to do with color , race and language . Stop Prop . 187 backers now before they devour the weak and helpless ; because if you don ' t , you ' ll soon see them turn their baleful glare your way . DELLENA MONTANO Anaheim</TEXT>
