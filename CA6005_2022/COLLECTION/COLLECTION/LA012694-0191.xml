   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : PIRU ; WORK DELAYED ON OIL SPILL CLEANUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cleanup of a 168 # 000-gallon oil spill in the Santa Clara River east of Piru was delayed Tuesday as the rain-swollen stream kept most workers at_bay . But berms built to contain the spill within a 12- to 15-mile stretch of the river held , and the rain did not push the sticky crude farther downstream as feared , California Department of Fish and Game officials said . &quot; We were concerned about the speed of the water and the roads that were muddy and slippery , so we limited the number of hand crews working , &quot; said Lt . Reed Smith , pollution response coordinator for Southern California and supervisor of the cleanup effort . &quot; we ' ll be back in full cleanup mode on Wednesday. &quot; The oil clung to willows , watercress and other vegetation along the banks and in the river wash . In some isolated pools of the river , a heavy sheen was visible . But no longer is the oil floating on_the_moving water . Since the Jan . 17 earthquake ruptured a pipeline near Valencia and spilled the oil into the river , crews have vacuumed up about 58 # 000 gallons of the oil . But Smith said the Department of Fish and Game and Arco , parent company of Four-Corners Pipeline , may raise the estimated amount of oil that spilled from the pipeline . That figure was not available Tuesday . Meanwhile , the toll of dead and injured animals rose . Crews have found 24 dead birds and 23 live birds coated with oil . They also found 629 dead fish , including three endangered unarmored three-spined_stickleback . The stretch of river contaminated by the spill was a habitat for the stickleback , Smith said . He said the population there is estimated at 100 to 200 stickleback , but no firm count exists . JOANNA M . MILLER</TEXT>
