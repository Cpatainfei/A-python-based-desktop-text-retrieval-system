   <TEXT> The Northridge quake hits . And now , it seems , many Angelenos are reaching for the bottle -- pills and booze . Prescriptions for tranquilizers and sleeping aids are pouring in to local pharmacies , several sources say . &quot; I have heard rumors , &quot; says Sue Navest , vice_president of marketing for the California Pharmacists ' Assn . &quot; But that is rumor ; nothing is confirmed. &quot; But Bob Somers , president of the San Fernando chapter of the association , says he can confirm . &quot; Definitely , &quot; he says . &quot; All of the pharmacies have had an increase in these prescriptions -- especially the tranquilizers Xanax , Valium and Ativan , and their generic equivalents. &quot; These drugs are mild tranquilizers designed to relieve anxiety and nervous tension . Ira Freeman , a pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in North Hollywood , also reports a slight increase in these prescriptions since the quake . &quot; I think it ' s quite common that people have difficulty sleeping &quot; since the quake , he says . &quot; There is a lot more anxiety . There is just a lot of stress out there . &quot; Everyone reacts differently to crises , but some people may feel a need for ( tranquilizers ) who have never taken these medications before. &quot; But experts on drug_abuse have something else to say on how people react to a crisis . The day after the earthquake , the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information issued a terse warning that &quot; alcohol , tobacco and other drug problems increase as a result of a natural disaster such_as an earthquake , flood or hurricane. &quot; Prescription_drugs can be easily misused in the turmoil following a disaster , says Bill Beard , an information specialist with the federally funded clearinghouse . &quot; Prescription_drugs are just that : They should be used under the strict advice of a physician . But what happens in many cases is that people act_on their own to increase the dosage or they use alcohol along with the drug , &quot; he says . &quot; Most prescriptions have strict warnings on how to use these drugs . In times of stress , however , people forget these warnings. &quot; Beard says the agency also urges people to avoid the use of alcohol to deal with stress . &quot; It is offered as a relaxant . But it can cause more trouble if it helps a person to not deal with their immediate problems , &quot; he says . Presumably , the new prescriptions are being issued by doctors and psychiatrists who have decided that short-term use of a tranquilizer can help their patients at this time . Somers guesses that perhaps half of the tranquilizer prescriptions represent patients who have never been_on such medications but have a need for them now . But most prescriptions issued are for &quot; a small quantity of the drug , for a limited time , &quot; he says . Chris Bement , a spokesman for the Thrifty Drug &amp; Discount_Stores chain , said those stores have not seen an increase in tranquilizers and sleeping aid prescriptions , adding : &quot; We would have had some inner discussion about it if that were so. &quot; The reason , he says , is because tranquilizer prescriptions must be reported to the state in_order to prevent drug_abuse . The drugs can be addictive with long-term use . And post-earthquake stress may go_on and on and on .</TEXT>
