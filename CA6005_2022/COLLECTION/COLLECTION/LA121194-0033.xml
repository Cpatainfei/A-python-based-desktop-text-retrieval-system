   <TEXT> In 1794 , the_English poets Robert Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge planned to ( but did not ) come_to America , meaning to set_up a Pantisocracy , an equal rule for all , on the banks of the Susquehanna_River . Paul Muldoon , an Irish poet who teaches at Princeton , nearly 200 years afterward , imagined what it would have been like if they had come West , and wrote a funny , tragic history of Western philosophy he called &quot; Madoc , A Mystery &quot; ( 1991 ) . In 1954 , Ross Macdonald , who wrote his brooding , father-quest mysteries in Santa Barbara , said : &quot; My fellow admirers of Coleridge will perhaps forgive me for suggesting that ' Christabel ' is an unfinished mystery novel in verse , whose subject is the elucidation of guilt and the ritual exorcism -- a guilt which arises from man ' s ability to sin against himself , both consciously and unconsciously. &quot; Making such a triangulation is good practice for reading Paul Muldoon ' s profound new poems , &quot; The Annals of Chile. &quot; Muldoon , &quot; this picaro of the information highway , &quot; is called &quot; one of the most metaphoric poets alive. &quot; &quot; Paul ' s changing the rules of the game , &quot; Seamus Heaney is said to have said . Or , he ' s playing the poets ' oldest game , but makes_it new . As Robert Graves knew , &quot; poetry is rooted in_love , and love in desire , and desire in the hope of continued existence. &quot; In that human loam are planted Muldoon ' s ancient roots . He was a young_man in the Sixties . His poems travel back through the sex , drugs and rock_and_roll ( Clapton and Hendrix ) of that age ; but deep through them also flow themes , and figures , of Irish legends : love , the ecclesiastical frustration of its desire , the poet ' s circuit ( a seasonal / eternal going_away and coming_back ) , the death of a lover or a mother , the poet ' s desire ( and failure -- and so his grief ) to restore life . What are &quot; the annals of Chile &quot; ? They are a riddle , and point to the mystery-riddle inside the poems . The poet calls_up O ' Higgins , ( presumably , Bernardo , the liberator of Chile in the early 19th Century ) : &quot; There is inherent vice in everything , &quot; as O ' Higgins would proclaim : it was O ' Higgins who duly had the terms &quot; widdershins &quot; and &quot; deasil &quot; expunged from the annals of Chile . Here is the mystery : these &quot; expunged &quot; words . Only by moving with him through the poems will we comprehend how their meaning may be uncovered . &quot; Yarrow , &quot; the book ' s most complex poem , is a vision-poem of atonement . Knowledge of disaster and loss suffuses it : &quot; all_of us would be swept away. &quot; As though watching a video , the poet reels back through memory and buried knowledge . His mother appears : she &quot; thumbs through a seed-catalogue / she ' s borrowed from Tohill ' s of the Moy. &quot; His father &quot; studies the grain in the shaft of a rake. &quot; These images carry pain . For balm , he chews on yarrow , used by the Chinese for divination , and by medieval monks for healing medicines , and by Achilles to stanch the bleeding wounds of his soldiers . His &quot; ma ticks_off a list / of seeds : Tohill , from tuathal , / meaning ' withershins ' -- with its regrettable overtones / of sunworship -- in our beloved Goidelic. &quot; Just as O ' Higgins said &quot; There is inherent vice / / in everything , &quot; so also this mother taught her son the Catholic vice inherent in sex , and it haunts him , nearly with the madness of King Lear . She is doubled and shadowed by S--- , the poet ' s lover during the Sixties , done_in by her own hand . In them he recognizes the deep and ancient link , for men , between women and ( frustrated ) desire and war . He is tormented , and his poems are haunted , by images of war . Even the sweet bucolic of &quot; Cows &quot; is menaced by a &quot; command wire at the trough &quot; that may be linked to a bomb . Graves said that the poet ' s ancient work was to reconcile warring partners . In an earlier book , we remember , Muldoon went looking_for his missing father , who &quot; disappeared / and took passage , almost for Argentina . . . / While he has gone no further than Brazil. &quot; Now , the poem called &quot; Brazil &quot; is one key to unriddling the title , for this Brazil is Breasal ' s Island , or Hy-Brazil , the mythic Irish land of pleasure and feasting . It is the world of dream and longing in which his mismatched parents lived while they spent their hard , hungry lives on the farmland , seeded from Tohill ' s catalogue , that is about to be swept_away . It is the verbal video of the poet-son ' s boy ' s books of legendary heroes , his imagined flights of derring-do beside Mike Fink , Arthur and Cuchulain . But Hy-Brazil doubles , in the poem ' s mind-movie , into S--- ' s terrible , drug-filled dreams of &quot; kingdoms naked in the trembling heart. &quot; The poet ( like Ross Macdonald ) searched for the lost father ( &quot; It seemed I would forever be driving west &quot; ) . He headed west in the Sixties and got as far as California . There , the vision goes psychedelic , as one image writhes against another and wipes it out . Drugs call_up false prophecies ; and he has a very bad trip . In his mastery of these images , Muldoon is the peer of Thomas Pynchon , whose &quot; Vineland , &quot; a true myth-fiction of California in the Sixties , delineates an American naivete and our endless fascination with evil . But why has the poet tried to solve the riddle of the expunged words ? We can turn for insight to the companion to &quot; The Annals , &quot; called &quot; The Prince of the Quotidian , &quot; published simultaneously ( by Wake Forest ) and meant to resolve &quot; questions &quot; raised by that volume . The poet is visited by a revenant , &quot; A man with a belly like a poisoned / pup . . . much the worse for drink , &quot; who demands he return to the real work : &quot; making metaphors. &quot; he slaps my cheek ; &quot; Above all else , you must atone for everything you ' ve said and done against your mother : meet excess of love with excess of love . . . . &quot; The poet -- this must have been fearsome -- will go_back to the beginning . &quot; The Annals , &quot; dedicated to the memory of his mother , opens with a rendering of Ovid ' s Leto . In homage ( he once had made light of that daughter of the Titans ) , he acknowledges her &quot; vindictive &quot; power to reduce men , who scorned to aid a woman and her children in need , to frogs , eternally cursing and babbling in their muddy pool . We come_to the last word : deasil , mentioned once and not repeated ; this key we must find by ourselves . In Irish , deasil means to travel in the direction of the sun . For the ancients , wrote the scholar Thomas F . O ' Rahill , &quot; to go dessel or right-handwise , thus imitating the course of the sun , was not only the right way to make a journey , but it was likewise beneficial in other affairs of life , and was likely to lead to a prosperous result. &quot; We now comprehend : in atonement , the poet has gone_on a poet ' s circuit back through his poems ; he has gone widdershins through the legends and history that enriched them , and the memories of experience that formed them , at every moment watching and listening for psychic echoes of the expunged words . By circling back through heart-wrench , he has tried to heal , and to reconcile all parties , to put them at one , as the poet once was obligated to do with his art . This poet longs for the gift of curing , but is given only perfect grief and the ashes of fury , as in the beautiful &quot; Incantata , &quot; when he cannot call_back his lover from the death she accepted . ( Inversely , in &quot; The Birth , &quot; weeping , he sings his new daughter into the world , by calling its lovely things to surround her. ) Deasil is a lost word of rightness ; for the poet , its promise cannot be fulfilled in life . The wheel turns , his vision ends ; and he is left standing , emptied ( this is the real fate of visionaries ) but minus relief , without respite . Nothing sentimental in this hard , clean end . To go the right way , for us , is to read the annals from beginning to end , in their reasonable order , unearthing their meanings , for there is nothing accidental in these poems ; every word , every reference , every allusion , carries meaning . That is the art , the gorgeous music of language , the poet has made of his harrowing vision-memories . As the poet -- this is his triumph , it is what marks this book with what may be greatness -- Paul Muldoon never flinches in his brilliant verbal workings , while his &quot; I , &quot; the tormented boy / man , the ancient mariner singing to us his holy and unholy visions , endures real suffering ; and if he is not granted rest , we who are reading are given a version of the perfected , the classical peace we might feel at the end of a sun-wise journey , in which we have seen revealed to us &quot; how art may be made. &quot;</TEXT>
