   <HEADLINE> MYSTERY SURROUNDS DEATH OF U.S. STUDENT IN MOSCOW ; RUSSIA : POLICE CALL IT SUICIDE , CORONER CALLS IT MURDER . CLASSMATE WHO FOUND THE BODY THINKS IT WAS AN ACCIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An American exchange student from Brown University has been found dead outside his Moscow dormitory , and although police insist that the death was a suicide , the coroner ' s report calls it murder . News_reports quoting unnamed faculty_members and other sources at the Russian State University for the Humanities suggest that the death of Anthony Riccio , 21 , may have been the work of local gangsters who had been renting_out space from a university that has a reputation for financial improprieties . But a classmate who found the body said he thought it was an accident . Police insist that the outgoing and energetic young_man who had been studying Russian since grade_school hanged himself from a balcony two floors above his dormitory_room just 10 days after arriving in Moscow . Riccio ' s family and classmates call that an unlikely scenario . Anthony Riccio loved Russia . When he was in grade_school , he told his father , &quot; How can we have peace with Russia if we can ' t speak_to them ? &quot; Riccio ' s death comes_on the eve of a U.S.-Russian summit at which Russia ' s efforts to combat its soaring crime and lawlessness are sure to be_on the agenda . President Boris N . Yeltsin hopes to convince the West that Russia is now stable , ready for full economic partnership and ripe for Western investment . But first , Western governments need assurances that Russia can stop the dangerous leakage of nuclear materials from the creaky former Soviet military complex . And Western businesses need assurances that Russia is curbing the organized crime that has become a serious threat to economic development here . &quot; There is only one problem : the bandits . The gangsters , &quot; Izvestia economics columnist Mikhail Berger said in an interview last week . &quot; Neither the taxes nor the political risks create problems as serious as the gangsters do . . . . This is a real national problem. &quot; But Riccio ' s father , John Riccio , said he would not want his son ' s death to discourage travel and exchange programs in Russia . &quot; This could have happened in New York City or Boston , &quot; Riccio said in a telephone_interview from his home_in Glastonbury , Conn . &quot; We would support these programs . If we had to do_it again , we ' d do_it again -- and Anthony certainly would. &quot; Riccio described his son , who was a junior in the Russian studies program at Brown University in Providence , R.I. , as &quot; very effervescent &quot; and &quot; unique. &quot; He said he did not dismiss the possibility of suicide but said that was a side of his son ' s personality he had never seen . The younger Riccio arrived in Moscow on Sept . 10 to study under a program run_by the American Collegiate Consortium and moved_into the dormitory on the southern outskirts of Moscow on Sept . 14 , the Moscow Times reported . John Riccio said he had a telephone_conversation with his son Sept . 12 and that he sounded &quot; normal. &quot; &quot; He was a very nice guy , &quot; a dormitory suite-mate named Maxim said Saturday . &quot; He liked listening to ( the rock_band ) Queen and was very joyful . He liked jokes and to laugh. &quot; He said Riccio had been homesick a day or two before his death but said he thought the death was accidental , not murder or suicide . Police_Chief Investigator Rafik M . Khuseinov said Riccio went from his 14th-floor room to the 16th floor Tuesday and tried to hang himself from the balcony but was too tall . So he climbed onto the balcony railing and threw himself off , Khuseinov said , breaking the rope as he fell . &quot; This is definitely not a murder case , &quot; the investigator said . &quot; Nobody heard any noise or struggle or shouts. &quot; Moreover , Riccio had little money , he said . Last week , authorities said a rope was found around Riccio ' s neck . But Maxim , who said he was among the students who found Anthony ' s body in a pool of blood about 6:45 p.m. Tuesday , said there was no rope , and the coroner ' s report , which calls the death a homicide , does not mention one . In the Russian army , where hazing deaths are not uncommon , the official cause of death is nearly always listed as suicide by hanging . Maxim said Riccio had been in the dorm only six days , knew no one , had no enemies and was not even expensively dressed . &quot; He was a smoker and used to go_to a balcony to smoke , &quot; he said . &quot; I really do not know why he did not go_to our balcony. &quot; But Maxim disputed media reports that &quot; strangers &quot; were living_in the dormitory , and he said police and university officials make security spot checks on the dormitory in the middle of the night . Five other American students who lived_in the dorm were moved to another dormitory . John Riccio said the family intends to have an autopsy performed in the United States .</TEXT>
