   <HEADLINE> VEHICLE SALES CLIMB 10.3 % DURING AUGUST ; AUTOMOBILES : LIGHT TRUCKS CONTINUE TO LEAD STRONG GAINS FOR THE BIG THREE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The major auto_makers shook_off some of the inventory problems that produced a flat July and finished August with sales of cars and light trucks 10.3 % ahead of a year ago . Much of the industry ' s strength continued to be in light trucks . Dealers can ' t keep enough pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles on_hand to meet customer demand . Ford Motor Co. ' s passenger_car sales were down 9.4 % from August , 1993 , and Chrysler Corp. ' s were down a fraction , but strong truck sales kept both from losing ground . General Motors Corp . rebounded from a July report that showed its overall vehicle sales down from a year earlier . The No . 1 auto_maker ' s August car sales were 18 % ahead of last year ; truck sales were up nearly 15 % . &quot; We think that ' s a good recovery , &quot; GM executive_vice_president William Hoglund said Tuesday . Industry executives and analysts agreed that sales are being held_down somewhat because the manufacturers don ' t have the factory capacity to satisfy demand for better-selling models . In addition , production of new models is still &quot; ramping up , &quot; automotive jargon for the slower , start-up phase of building a vehicle when the assembly process is being fine-tuned . &quot; We ' re still moaning about availability , but it ' s better , &quot; Hoglund said . &quot; We ' re still selling what we build. &quot; He said GM expects the industry will finish the year with sales of 15.3 million vehicles , compared to 14.2 million last year . Several car_companies will bring high-profile new models to showrooms this fall , setting the stage for what many expect to be a strong fourth quarter . &quot; We expect our momentum to accelerate further starting Sept . 29 , when we unveil most of our 1995 car and truck lines , &quot; said Ford sales and marketing vice_president Robert L . Rewey . Japanese car_makers showed more growth than the industry as_a_whole in August . Toyota ' s overall sales led the pack , up 23.4 % from a year ago , but Nissan and Honda also gained .</TEXT>
