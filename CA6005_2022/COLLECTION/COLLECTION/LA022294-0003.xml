   <HEADLINE> 3 STRIKES AND YOU ' RE WHERE ? AND NOW FEDERAL PROPOSALS ; GET VIOLENT CRIMINALS OFF THE STREET ? YOU BET , BUT HOW BEST TO DO IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Three strikes and you ' re out &quot; is political shorthand for legislation born_out of enormous anger and fear about violent crime in America . Such sentencing proposals , under_consideration in Congress and roughly 30 states , are intended to imprison three-time felons for life . The problems associated with &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation are present in the federal versions as well as in the many pending state proposals that we discussed in two recent editorials . The impulse behind the bills -- to get criminals off the street and behind bars for as long as possible -- must be carefully targeted if it is not to trigger the famous Law of Unintended Consequences , the recurring phenomenon that so often plagues public policy in America . The federal versions , authored by Sens . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) and Trent Lott ( R-Miss. ) , take the form of two amendments to the $ 22.3- billion federal crime bill that the Senate passed in November . They would impose mandatory life sentences for individuals convicted of a third &quot; federal crime of violence &quot; ( under varying definitions ) or those who received two prior state convictions for committing a violent crime . The law also would apply in cases of a third conviction for a major drug trafficking offense or selling drugs to minors , crimes that are not necessarily violent . Supporters of various &quot; three strikes &quot; proposals include no less than President Clinton , who virtually endorsed the idea in his State of the Union message last month ; other backers are California Gov . Pete Wilson and New York Gov . Mario Cuomo . However , Clinton now is expressing second_thoughts about the federal legislation . He has good reason to do so -- and he should be applauded for airing his reservations despite the current anti-crime stampede . With crime the top concern for many Americans -- 43 % , according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll -- no politician wants to be seen as soft_on lawbreakers . But far too few federal legislators are thinking realistically about how a &quot; three strikes &quot; policy actually would work or are questioning the underlying assumptions of the Gramm and Lott amendments . 1 . Would &quot; three strikes &quot; laws deter crime ? Politicians pass tough criminal sentencing laws , whether federal or state , because they believe that such laws have a strong deterrent effect on crime . But the evidence for this is not convincing . Despite increasingly harsh and inflexible prison sentences in recent decades , particularly for drug offenses , the national crime_rate has rocketed by 371 % since 1960 -- increasing nine times faster than the population . These tough sentencing laws may well have prevented an even greater rise in crime , but as in the case of past sentencing reforms their deterrent effect is anything but obvious . 2 . Which three-time felons should be incarcerated for life ? Beginning in the mid-1980s and as part of its high-profile war on drugs , Congress imposed harsh mandatory minimum sentences for a wide variety of drug crimes , including those involving first-time offenders and those convicted on charges of nonviolent sale or possession of drugs . In so doing , Congress severely eroded judicial discretion and a fundamental_principle of our justice system -- that the punishment should be fair , that it should fit the crime . Existing mandatory minimum laws are problematic ; &quot; three strikes &quot; proposals are mandatory minimums in another guise . And those that sweep nonviolent felons into prison for life would n ' t be smart policy either . These proposals make_sense only when they are targeted on repeat felons with a record of violence . The Times endorses that approach . 3 . Do federal prisons have room to house three-time felons for life ? Simply put , no . The federal prison population is already 40 % over capacity and growing at the fastest rate in the world . When Atty . Gen . Janet Reno launched an inquiry last year into the composition of the federal prison population , she asked whether beds in overcrowded federal prison facilities were , in_effect , being wasted on low-level nonviolent offenders as a result of those laws . As suspected , the study , issued earlier this month , found that about one of every five federal prisoners -- 16 # 316 in all -- are &quot; low-level &quot; offenders . Two-thirds of those inmates were serving a mandatory minimum sentence . The federal inmate population already is projected to grow significantly as more crimes become federal offenses . If a federal &quot; three strikes &quot; law passes , repeat felons sentenced to life can be accommodated only if Congress rethinks the unrealistic sentencing guidelines it imposed earlier for some nonviolent offenders . The people deserve full answers to the questions surrounding &quot; three strikes. &quot; Those answers aren ' t likely to be the stuff of slogans but surely they will be the foundation of sound public policy . And a safer America as well .</TEXT>
