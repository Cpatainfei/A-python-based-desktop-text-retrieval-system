   <HEADLINE> THE BARRICADE ; IRBE HELPED LATVIA STOP RUSSIANS , AND NOW HE STOPS SHOTS FOR SHARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Someone yelled that soldiers were coming_to drive them from the barricades , and who knew what might follow ? Arturs Irbe would not leave , could not leave . He would stop them . He would be Ka Muris . Like wall . After Soviet forces had killed protesters in Vilnius , Lithuania , for rebelling against the government ' s distant and oppressive rule early in 1991 , citizens of Latvia -- another Baltic_state yearning for independence -- protested that invasion . That made them the new targets of the government ' s ire . When the Moscow government sent tanks rolling to Riga , Latvia ' s capital and Irbe ' s hometown , thousands took_to the streets and put_up barriers to protect buildings , radio_stations , TV towers and historical landmarks . Irbe , who plays now for the San Jose Sharks , was among them , prepared to fight soldiers sent by the country he had represented less than a year earlier at the 1990 World Hockey Championships . Although he had worn the Soviet uniform , he never bought the Soviet message . &quot; I didn ' t play for the red flag . Not for Russia , &quot; he said . &quot; I tried to tell people , ' I ' m not Russian . I ' m Latvian. ' &quot; Later , outraged by the Soviets ' heavy-handedness in the Baltics , he quit the national team , knowing he might lose a chance to showcase his talents and win a lucrative NHL contract . And when he manned the barricades through four long , tumultuous nights , he risked his life . &quot; There were moments people said , ' Troops are coming_with gases , ' &quot; he said . &quot; We are in the middle of a brawl , myself and my wife , and we didn ' t know what was happening . Of course ( there was danger ) . But there wasn ' t that much fear because we were all together . There was a sense of the country ' s heartbeat , our nation ' s heartbeat . &quot; That was a great time and a great experience in my life . I met people back there on the streets , on the barricades , who said , ' What are you going_to do ? There is a big tournament coming_up , the World Championships ? Are you going_to play for the Soviets ? ' I said , ' No . After this I cannot do that. ' They really cheered that . I had no chance to decide any other way except to refuse . I told my wife , ' I cannot play for them , whatever happens . I could not refuse to remember. ' &quot; Irbe ' s resolve -- and that of his compatriots -- won out . He was unhurt , and Latvia gained its independence . Its economy is unsteady , but it is free . And its people are fiercely proud_of Irbe , who is tending goal for the Sharks with the same determination he showed at those barricades . He is Ka Muris . Like wall . &quot; I got a phone_call from Riga ( last week ) and the person who did the connection , the telephone_company operator , I know her very well , &quot; he said . &quot; She was so excited , because we just won first game in Toronto . She said , ' You would n ' t believe the people , in the morning , they are asking each other how did Sharks do ? ' &quot; They are not talking even about how are going the talks between our president and ( Russian ) President ( Boris ) Yeltsin about withdrawing arms and troops from Latvia . The first question is how the Sharks did , did they win. &quot; The answer , with surprising frequency , has been yes . In their third season , the Sharks are making an impressive first foray_into the playoffs . Led by Irbe , who played an NHL-record 4 # 412 minutes this season and compiled a sparkling 2.84 goals-against average , they upset the top-seeded Detroit Red Wings in the first round and are even with the Toronto Maple Leafs after four games of their quarterfinal series . On this defense-oriented team , the 27-year-old goalie is the last and most important line_of_defense . Stocky at 5 feet 8 and 180 pounds , he ' s remarkably agile and exceptional at controlling rebounds . That means he can prevent goal-mouth scrambles that might lead to flurries of shots , and to goals . &quot; Without him , we would n ' t be here , &quot; Shark defenseman Jeff Norton said . &quot; Archie got us this far. &quot; Irbe , who was drafted by Minnesota in 1989 and acquired by San Jose in the 1991 dispersal draft , will try to carry them one step farther tonight , when Game 5 is played_at the San Jose Arena . The decibel levels could be ear-shattering . Shark fans , frenzied over the team ' s success , roar at his every save . They serenade him with chants of &quot; Irr-bay ! Irr-bay ! &quot; and decorate the building with banners depicting walls , a tribute to his motto . They also groan at his earnest but misguided attempts at passing the puck . Irbe has become as infamous for his bad puck handling as he is famous for puck stopping , and fans have been known to cover their eyes when he tries to make a pass . His teammates wish they could do the same . &quot; It ' s kind of comical , &quot; center Todd Elik said . It ' s not always funny to Coach Kevin Constantine , though . He has watched Irbe ' s misadventures since the 1991-92 season , when he coached Irbe and the Kansas City Blades to the International Hockey_League title . &quot; I just tell everybody to pay him more because he provides entertainment to fans of hockey everywhere , &quot; Constantine said . He hasn ' t told Irbe to stop handling the puck because he has been able to laugh after most of Irbe ' s gaffes . After giving the puck away to Kris Draper in Game 4 against Detroit , and to Mark Osborne in the opener against Toronto , Irbe didn ' t give_up another goal in either game . The Sharks won both . &quot; He ' s very strong-willed , &quot; forward Jeff Odgers said . &quot; If he makes a mistake , he ' ll try that much harder to make_it up because he doesn ' t want to let the team down. &quot; That resilience is why Constantine , who rarely smiles , grins when the subject is Irbe . &quot; Arturs is a special guy , &quot; he said . &quot; Our season has been heavily dependent_on his goaltending . Ask anybody on the team , on the coaching staff . If we ' ve had any success this season , he ' s been a major part of it . Being an ex-goalie , I have a soft_spot for him and a little extra affection for him. &quot; Even opponents like him . When Detroit ' s Dino Ciccarelli crashed Irbe ' s crease to distract him , Irbe chirped , &quot; Hello , Dino. &quot; Ciccarelli , disarmed , was speechless . &quot; How can you hate a guy like that ? &quot; he said later . With Winnipeg enforcer Tie Domi , Irbe was critical . When Domi declared he would hurt Irbe , the goalie calmly replied , &quot; You should try to do something interesting. &quot; Domi was too startled to reply . It ' s not easy to carry_on a conversation while facing slap shots and onrushing opponents . Shark assistant coach Wayne Thomas , whose eight-year NHL goaltending career included a Stanley Cup championship with Montreal , admires Irbe ' s ability to gab and grab . &quot; I had enough trouble stopping the puck that I couldn ' t talk to guys , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; A guy like ( the New York Islanders ' ) Billy Smith , he was able to stop the puck and keep his concentration enough to yap at guys . I didn ' t have that ability . Arturs is kind of matter-of-fact about it . &quot; He ' s pretty intense , but controlled . He has an unbelievable will to win and succeed , but he manages to stay_on a pretty even keel. &quot; Thomas attributes Irbe ' s puck-handling problems to that hunger to succeed . &quot; He has done a great job of mastering the art of blocking pucks , with his hunger to learn and get better at the position , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; The next stop , in his mind , is breaking the puck out of the zone . Right now he ' s caught in between . Sometimes he ' s too active and tries to do too_much . &quot; For all players , it ' s a learning process of ' simple is good. ' There ' s going_to be some growing pains , but thank goodness he wants to get better. &quot; He learned English much faster than he ' s learning to pass pucks . Irbe , who joined the Sharks ' Kansas City affiliate in 1991 , used to beg_off team gatherings by claiming he didn ' t know the language well enough . He tripped himself up during a promotion in San Jose last season , when he was asked if he wanted to sit on the bench with a last-place NHL team or play in the minors for a division-leading team . &quot; It ' s better to be a pauper among kings than a king among paupers , &quot; he said . An articulate statement for someone unfamiliar_with English , and a quote that caught Constantine ' s attention . He asked Irbe if he had said that exactly as written . &quot; Yes , I did , &quot; Irbe said , proudly . Replied Constantine , &quot; You just lost your English_language excuse. &quot; Irbe uses his language skills to lead his teammates on the ice and in the locker_room . He ' s vocal , and his words carry weight . &quot; He ' s very supportive , &quot; said defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh , a fellow Latvian . &quot; Maybe a_couple_of times he will get mad at defensemen and start screaming . Mostly he is supportive and he pats you on the pads . He ' s great. &quot; When he converses , Irbe can do_it in English , Latvian or Russian . He and Russian-born teammates Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov , stars on the great Soviet teams of the 1980s , often discuss politics . Although they are products of a government that repressed his homeland , Irbe found he has more in common with them than in_dispute . He especially enjoys talking with Larionov , who also rebelled , in his case against the iron fist of the Soviet hockey federation . &quot; I understand his point_of_view , but I had to learn on my own , &quot; Irbe said . &quot; I really almost 100 % agree with Igor . I never heard from anyone who was_on former Soviet team when I quit saying , ' Shame , ' or blame me for refusing to play . They understood my nationalism and activity. &quot; His country is never far from his mind . Irbe went_home last summer to play for Latvia in an Olympic qualifying tournament , and he brought his mother to the Bay Area this season to live with him , his wife and infant daughter . He also brought his best_friends here , paying their expenses because they could not afford to . A brother and sister remain in Latvia . &quot; It ' s a difficult time because the system is changing , &quot; Irbe said . &quot; The Soviet system was so deep in people ' s minds , people ' s routines . Young people , they can make adjustments right away . For older people , it ' s real tough . . . . &quot; It ' s becoming clear there ' s no middle_class . Almost none at all . Very small middle_class . Bigger upper_class and a very , very huge lower class , people who live_on ( the ) minimum just to survive . &quot; This is some kind of extra joy in their lives , that myself and Sandis , we are playing for this team and having success . We are really playing for our country now , not only for San Jose. &quot;</TEXT>
