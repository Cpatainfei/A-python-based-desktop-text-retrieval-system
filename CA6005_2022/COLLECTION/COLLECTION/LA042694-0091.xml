   <HEADLINE> SATTIEWHITE DEATH SENTENCE IS UPHELD ; COURTS : JUDGE LAWRENCE STORCH REJECTS DEFENSE_ATTORNEYS ' REQUEST FOR A LIFE TERM WITHOUT PAROLE FOR THE CONVICTED MURDERER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A convicted Oxnard murderer was sentenced Monday to die in the gas_chamber by a judge whom the Ventura County district_attorney ' s office described as overly lenient last week . Superior_Court Judge Lawrence Storch ' s decision upholds a verdict of death for Christopher James Sattiewhite , 24 , who shot 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzales in the head three times Jan . 26 , 1992 , and left her body in a drainage_ditch along Arnold Road . Monday ' s sentencing was closely watched by district_attorney ' s officials because Sattiewhite ' s lawyers had requested that Storch throw_out the jury ' s recommended death sentence for Sattiewhite in favor of life in prison without parole . On April 19 , prosecutors began using a rare legal challenge to ban Storch from hearing any new criminal cases because he granted a defense_attorney ' s request to alter the verdict in another murder case a week earlier . In that case , Storch voided a first-degree murder_conviction for Todd Love of Newbury Park and convicted him of second-degree murder , a lesser count . Storch ' s decision shaved 10 years from the 25-year prison_term that Love faced for killing his sister ' s boyfriend . And Storch added three years to Love ' s sentence for using a gun in the murder , instead of the five years sought by prosecutors . On Monday , however , Storch declined to spare Sattiewhite from the death sentence . The judge said he is confident that the evidence presented during the trial supports the jury ' s verdict . &quot; In the 20 years that I ' ve been doing this , I have presided over many , many murder cases , &quot; Storch said , in delivering his ruling . &quot; This is one of the most egregious I have seen. &quot; * Investigators said the Gonzales murder occurred after Sattiewhite inadvertently called_out the name of an accomplice who had joined him in kidnaping and raping the victim . The killing was necessary to prevent the woman from identifying her assailants , according to court testimony . In contrast to the strong emotions he displayed when the jury returned a verdict of death against him March 28 , Sattiewhite appeared unmoved by Storch ' s pronouncement . He even asked the court to ignore his attorney ' s request to delay the sentencing several weeks to further investigate a pre-sentence report in the case . &quot; I don ' t want to continue , &quot; Sattiewhite said , interrupting attorney Willard P . Wiksell , who was trying to ask_for the delay . &quot; I want to go . . . . I ' ve been here too long . I ' m ready to go. &quot; Sattiewhite ' s mother watched her son ' s outburst from the audience . &quot; Boy , shut_up ! &quot; Margaret Sattiewhite admonished her son . Afterward , Margaret Sattiewhite expressed disappointment in both the decisions of the judge and the jury . &quot; I think it was unjust , &quot; she said , tears welling_up in her eyes . &quot; I feel bad at this point . It ' s just unbelievable. &quot; Specifically , she criticized the fact that there were no blacks on the jury . Sattiewhite is black . &quot; I feel if it was a white_man , justice would have been done_better , &quot; Margaret Sattiewhite told reporters . &quot; There was no blacks on the panel . It should have been moved &quot; to another county . Attorneys in the case said two blacks were among the large group of people from which 12 jurors were selected . One of those prospective jurors asked to be excused for hardship reasons . The other was excluded by prosecutors , who aren ' t required by state law to explain why they disqualify a juror . In addition to the motion to give Sattiewhite life in prison , Storch also denied a defense motion for a new trial . Defense_attorneys requested the new trial because a probation report revealed for the first time that the 69-year-old mother of victim Genoveva Gonzales opposes the death_penalty and told authorities that she did not believe Sattiewhite should face death . Wiksell accused the prosecution of deception for not telling the jury of the mother ' s wishes before the panel deliberated . Wiksell said that information &quot; makes_it more likely than not that a different verdict would have been given. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Donald C . Glynn called that information irrelevant , saying a philosophical viewpoint of a relative is immaterial to the facts of the case . Storch agreed with Glynn , saying the jury was never led to believe that Gonzales ' mother wanted vengeance for her daughter ' s murder . Wiksell then argued for Storch to use his authority as judge to overrule the jury ' s recommendation and send Sattiewhite to prison without parole . * The defense_attorney repeated arguments he made during the trial that Sattiewhite has brain damage and was abused by his father as a child . &quot; While it is a bad crime , &quot; he said of Gonzales ' death , &quot; I don ' t think one can say . . . that this is the most shocking murder to ever hit Ventura County. &quot; Glynn told the judge that Sattiewhite is much more intelligent than his attorneys acknowledge . &quot; Although he is scholastically no higher than a 12-year-old , he ' s certainly street smart , &quot; Glynn said . &quot; The death_penalty was appropriate , and I would ask that the court leave the death_penalty intact. &quot; Storch said he was particularly influenced by two facts that came_out during the trial . One is that Sattiewhite and two other men had raped a young_woman on the Oxnard Shores Beach several months before Gonzales ' death , while forcing the rape victim ' s boyfriend to watch at gunpoint . The second is that after Gonzales was raped and shot , Sattiewhite and his accomplices went_to a restaurant . They ate a meal , seemingly undisturbed by the murder . &quot; The court has not heard any remorse from the defendant , &quot; Storch said .</TEXT>
