   <TEXT> Every year of Caldonia ' s 36 years , they ' d all gathered at Mother ' s for Thanksgiving . That was before Dad died and the house on East 23rd was sold to a Chinese man , Lee Wong . Think_of it ! Ten of those Wongs crammed into the old stucco house that used to feel crowded with just five : Mother , Daddy , Caldonia , Vesta and Clayton . It made Caldonia shake her head in disbelief . Caldonia ' s latest obstetrician was Chinese , or was it Japanese ? She never could keep it straight . A Chinese girl at_work recently corrected Caldonia and said , &quot; I ' m Filipina. &quot; Then she reached_out and laid her narrow hand on Caldonia ' s rounded stomach , so unexpectedly that Caldonia felt as if she ' d been intruded_on . The girl , seeing Caldonia ' s surprise , smiled and said , &quot; For luck . For me . I want a baby , too. &quot; Caldonia felt the warmth of the girl ' s hand long after it had been withdrawn . For the last month of Caldonia ' s pregnancy , her Chinese or Japanese or whatever-she-was obstetrician had been seeing Caldonia once a week . The doctor was a small , friendly woman with bright eyes who dressed in elegant suits , as if she were running_off to business meetings instead of squatting on a chair to peer up between her patients ' legs . She spoke proper English without any accent . &quot; Everything looks good , &quot; she told Caldonia . &quot; Everything looks just as it should. &quot; This was Caldonia ' s third child , her conception so unexpected that at first Caldonia had not told Fred . She waited over a week . Not that she would have ever considered not having the child , but Caldonia needed time alone to absorb the fact that , even with Iris and Nadia both in school , she was going_to be the mother of a baby again , faced with diapers and sleepless nights . Now , as she busied herself in the kitchen , Caldonia longed for the past Thanksgivings at the East 23rd Street house , when Mother had festooned the doorways with crepe_paper , and Daddy , in his matching slacks and sweater , carried_out the holiday routine of washing and polishing every inch of his two black Cadillacs . Standing_in that immaculate driveway , chamois in_hand , he always greeted and chided them as they arrived , his children , then his grandchildren , encouraging everyone to pause and admire the shine of fenders and hoods , and listen to him brag for the hundredth time , &quot; Look_at that , a_hundred_thousand miles and not a scratch , not a bump . . . . &quot; Thanksgivings with Mother and Daddy had always been so perfect . There was plenty of room and more_than enough food for anyone who happened along ; neighbors , friends , extra relatives , dropping_in for some of Mother ' s famous sweet_potato pie : &quot; Oh , and while you ' re at it , honey , try a little taste of turkey and a bit of oyster dressing , and just go_ahead and get you some of my bread pudding , too. &quot; But the last year had brought_about many changes . Daddy was dead and Mother had squeezed herself and her possessions into the cement-block Harriet Tubman senior high-rises in West Oakland . Her cramped fourth-floor apartment , with its tiny kitchenette overlooking the freeway , no longer accommodated the swell of family . She now boiled tea water on a two-burner stove and heated_up frozen dinners in a microwave . And Mother herself , gone stoop-shouldered and brackish and irritable , complained that the grandchildren made her nervous when they came_to visit : She reproached them for being too loud in the elevators , always threatening to pull on the emergency buzzer , and she worried they ' d tear_up her furniture , so she ' d covered everything in plastic and laid runners along the beige pile carpet . She spoke more sharply to Caldonia , Vesta and Clayton , her three grown children , as if they were still children themselves , wearing_on her last good nerve . What Mother announced to Caldonia about Thanksgiving this year was , &quot; I ' ve retired from cooking , and now it ' s somebody else ' s turn. &quot; What she meant was , &quot; It ' s up_to you , Caldonia ; Clayton and Vesta are useless. &quot; So Caldonia and Fred won by default , even though Caldonia was just a month past giving_birth and still feeling sore and irritable . This child had come Cesarean , a fact that dulled Caldonia ' s sense of accomplishment . It seemed the baby had not really come_out of her body . Now here she was , barely recuperated , roasting the turkey and browning homemade bread crumbs , all because she knew better than to count_on Vesta and Clayton . &quot; Y ' all gonna have to pitch_in ; I ' m not the Lone Ranger , you know , &quot; she told Vesta and Clayton by phone , with special emphasis in her voice just to make_a_point . She wondered if God was growing weary with her impatience . After all , He ' d seen_to_it that Caldonia and Fred were blessed with so_much . that ' s how friends and family saw it , too . She and Fred seemed to make_good choices , beginning with each other . Yes , fortune had often smiled on them . Fred was always getting promotions and raises on the police_force . Caldonia had just made supervisor at the phone_company . They paid their bills on_time , they attended church , and they ' d saved enough money to put Nadia and Iris in a private Christian school . Their good_fortune wasn ' t lost on Vesta . &quot; Y ' all got all my luck , &quot; she was fond of saying . But luck always has a limit . It started with the Cesarean birth of this third child . Caldonia suspected Fred was a little disappointed this hadn ' t been a boy , though he ' d never say such a thing . In her hospital_bed , breathing hard and pushing , Caldonia recalled the Filipina woman ' s hand touching her . At the time , Caldonia had felt too startled to be annoyed , and then she realized the woman meant no harm . But it felt_like a curse . And her labor was long and hard . When the pains got the worst , the doctor ordered the baby cut_out . It was a disappointment , but after a short_sleep and the drowsy aftermath , Caldonia found herself coming_to in the bright light of_her_own excitement . She made_out the shape and length of a perfect form , eyes , ears , fingers and toes all there and accounted_for . She cried_out in happiness , a miracle even the third time , grasping the wet thing in her arms . But later , as her mind cleared and they cleaned_up the baby and returned her , Caldonia got a good look . She began to suspect a blunder . During her sleep , something must have happened . The child , made_up of parts of her and Fred , did not seem to belong_to either of them , and Caldonia wasn ' t sure where to lay the blame , if such a thing could be blamed at all : on God ( whom she fiercely loved ) or Nature ( which she tried to respect ) or the very chromosomes in the cells of_her_own body , which had bleached the child the color of milk , tinted her eyes pink , stained the thin spread of hair an off-shade of lemon . If Fred hadn ' t actually seen the child emerge from her body , she would have been certain there was a hospital mix-up , and some white couple was going_home with her child . Later , she recalled an article she saw years ago in the National Enquirer : &quot; White Couple Gives_Birth to Black Baby. &quot; The article went_on to say that the woman , unbeknownst to her , carried black genes . The husband didn ' t believe the woman , accused her of infidelity and divorced her immediately . Caldonia thought_about an article in the reverse : &quot; Black_Woman Gives_Birth to White Baby. &quot; It would n ' t work because a black_woman ' s baby , no matter how light , would always be black . Fred had to remind Caldonia that this was a gift from God , and that whatever God had in His plan they must accept with humility . Caldonia cried bitterly anyway . &quot; It ' s our child , &quot; he kept telling her . &quot; What is wrong with you ? &quot; But Caldonia prayed secretly and fervently that the child would darken . From upstairs , there came a soft cry . Caldonia set_down the wooden spoon she ' d been stirring the cranberry_sauce with and turned_down the flame under the pot . She was quicker to attend_to the needs of this child than she ' d been with Iris and Nadia . By the time she ' d gotten upstairs and was peering into the crib , the baby was sleeping soundly again in her nest of quilts . Caldonia had taken_to dressing her in blue ; pink was so unflattering , causing her features to all but disappear in that little white face . Often , while the baby slept , Caldonia sat close by and watched . She wanted to understand exactly who this child was . She couldn ' t help comparing the luscious dark silk of her two older daughters ' baby skin , how warm they were to the touch . This child seemed cold and foreign , a baby from some northern clime -- Scandinavia , perhaps , a place inhabited by people with white skin and canary-yellow hair , with eyes like frost . And yet , Nature had played a trick , for the baby ' s small lips were_full , her cheekbones high and her nose broad like Fred ' s . And her hair was a thick cap of tight nappy curls . Daily , Caldonia checked the little crescents just under the child ' s tiny cuticles , but she found no indication that the skin there intended to darken . Caldonia lingered by the sleeping baby , reassured by her soft breathing . From a certain angle , with the blinds drawn , the child might almost be considered pretty . There was a loud knock , followed by several more , at the front_door . Caldonia pulled herself away and hurried down the stairs , fastening her apron_strings as she went . It was Baby Sister Vesta , the first to arrive . It was only noon , but since Vesta ' s 10th or so separation from Harold Sr. , she was always showing_up places early . &quot; You ' re going to take all_the skin off your knuckles pounding on my door like that , &quot; Caldonia scolded . Vesta was holding a large green_salad in a wooden bowl , covered with Saran_Wrap . Behind her , Rosie and Li ' l Harold were still piling out of Vesta ' s dented and rusted red Toyota , with the bad starter and moody brakes and the cockeyed windshield_wipers . As usual , they were already fussing with each other . Caldonia stepped back and let Vesta past , bearing the salad_bowl , which reminded Caldonia of a miniature terrarium . &quot; Now why ' d you go_on and dress the salad like that ? &quot; Caldonia was annoyed . &quot; Dinner ' s not until 2. &quot; Vesta was unfazed . She was already peeping into the living room to inspect the new sectional furniture Caldonia and Fred had ordered from a catalogue . &quot; Ooooooh , this musta costed y ' all a fortune ! &quot; she exclaimed . &quot; Mmmmm , and light-colored , too . I ' d never dare have anything light-colored with Rosie and Li ' l Harold around. &quot; Vesta had never been considered pretty ( certainly not the way Caldonia was -- high_school homecoming queen and so on ) what with her lumpy potato shape , funny lopsided smile and eyes set too close_together , like a moth ' s . She was the lightest of Mother ' s children , honey butterscotch , but her complexion was uneven in places , scarred dark by childhood acne . And Vesta had never learned to dress . Today she was wearing yellow and black striped tights , two sizes too small , and an oversized yellow turtleneck with black pockets . Caldonia thought her sister looked_like a misshapen bumblebee . And those red shoes , like Minnie Mouse ! Caldonia had never seen anything so ugly and cheap looking . Rosie and Li ' l Harold burst through the door and flung themselves on her . These wild children were the opposite of Iris and Nadia : careful , precise girls who rarely made messes and whom Vesta referred to disparagingly one infamous Christmas as &quot; those little prisses. &quot; It took two whole weeks for Caldonia to get_over that slight . &quot; Where ' s the baby ? &quot; cried Rosie , and Harold echoed , &quot; Where ' s the baby ? &quot; They ' d come clutching armloads of complicated toys_with multiple loose parts that would soon be scattered . They continued to press themselves against Caldonia with wet kisses and sticky hands . &quot; Yes , where is the baby ? &quot; Vesta wanted to know , bending over to see if the plastic flowers in the vase were real . &quot; She ' s ' sleep , upstairs , &quot; said Caldonia gently . &quot; Y ' all named her yet ? Mother ' s fit to be tied about that poor child. &quot; Caldonia made her voice firm . &quot; No , we haven ' t decided on a name yet. &quot; Vesta clucked her tongue like an old_woman . &quot; Scandalous , &quot; she said cheerfully . &quot; You can ' t have a no-name child. &quot; Before Caldonia could snap back , Vesta went_on , eyeing Caldonia ' s new beige curtains at the window . &quot; I can ' t wait to have me my own place . I ' ll tell you , girl , Clayton is driving me nuts . He ' s so damn picky . Picky this , picky that . He blew_up at the kids the other morning , I mean really lost_it , because he said they ' d eaten all his cold_cereal . Can you believe that ? Yelling at my kids . Over cold_cereal ! &quot; &quot; Brother ' s doing you a favor , &quot; Caldonia reminded her . &quot; What you need to do is get things straight with Harold. &quot; Vesta blew air from her mouth . &quot; That man works my final nerve ! &quot; She turned so quickly on her red shoes that her heel left a scuff mark across Caldonia ' s polished hardwood floor . &quot; Harold is your husband , &quot; said Caldonia . Rosie and Li ' l Harold started on a mess in the hallway . Caldonia jumped in . &quot; You kids set your toys over there , and then you can go swing_out back . Take turns . No fussing . I don ' t want to have to come_out there. &quot; When she turned_around , Vesta was poking her face into the oven for a peek at the turkey . &quot; This thing ' s big as a elephant ! &quot; she exclaimed , swallowed_up in steam . &quot; Girl , get outta my oven . You ' re gonna make_it cook uneven. &quot; &quot; I could baste it. &quot; &quot; It ' s self-basting , &quot; sighed Caldonia . &quot; Close the door. &quot; &quot; Where is everybody ? &quot; Vesta asked . &quot; Fred ' s in the family_room watching the game , but don ' t bother him , and the girls are down the street. &quot; Vesta was wearing that awful wig again , the straight-hair page boy , three shades too light for her complexion . It reminded Caldonia of one of the old Supremes . So what if Vesta ' s real hair was thinning , it was all that worry over Harold . If she ' d just ditch him once and for all , her hair would thicken , her skin would clear , and her whole life would improve . She ' d lose some weight , could afford decent clothes , and she ' d get another man , if that ' s what she wanted . Caldonia didn ' t believe_in divorce , but in this case she thought it was high_time Vesta and Harold Sr . split_up for good . How those two had managed to last all these years was a mystery . Everybody ' d warned her from the start , that very first day Vesta dragged Harold home from high_school . They ' d succeeded in putting a stop to their eternal fussing long enough to concoct their two unruly children , but otherwise it was always hurricane weather at Vesta ' s . Daddy ' d had a fit . He had forbidden Vesta to marry Harold , told her the boy was all flash and foolishness , barely one step_up from a hoodlum . But she was so hardheaded and downright silly , she just thumbed her nose at Daddy and forged ahead with a huge wedding , marrying Harold in an expensive ceremony at the Methodist_church Mother attended . Daddy ended_up bankrolling the whole naughty business , including the expensive lace dress with train , though everyone knew Vesta had about as much business wearing white as the_devil himself . So it was that Vesta had spent these last 14 years paying the piper . Over and over , she ' d packed up the children and left Big Harold lock , stock and barrel . This time it was Clayton who relented and let her move_in with him in his two-bedroom apartment down on Lake Merritt . It was supposed to be temporary , just until Vesta made other arrangements , but now six months had passed , and Clayton had confided to Caldonia that his patience was wearing_thin . Foolish Clayton . It wasn ' t as if Caldonia hadn ' t cautioned him . He was always getting suckered into things like this , and now he was whining all_the time to Caldonia . Said he was tired_of coming_home from the community_college where he taught business classes to find the living room floor littered with Rosie ' s Black Barbie-and-her-accessories and the horse doll with the eyelashes and purple hair and all her accessories , and pieces of Li ' l Harold ' s Lego set strewn around , and an oblivious Vesta curled_up on the sofa with Clayton ' s plaid bathrobe over her legs watching &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; and eating Cheez-Its . At first , Caldonia tried to listen patiently , the way the Lord would want her to . But she finally had to tell Clayton straight out that he needed to &quot; put the girl out. &quot; She spoke from experience . Just a year ago , she and Fred had hosted Vesta and the kids , and now here they were having to spend good money replacing the sectional furniture that Rosie and Li ' l Harold had crayoned on . Vesta leaned across the countertop to steal an olive from the cut-glass dish . &quot; You know , Clayton ' s bringing a woman over today , &quot; she announced coyly . Caldonia launched into making biscuits . &quot; Over here ? He didn ' t mention it to me. &quot; &quot; that ' s because he ' s afraid you won ' t approve. &quot; She let that sink_in . &quot; Let ' s see , Jean or Jane , shoot ! I never can remember her name. &quot; Vesta headed over to the fridge for a diet soda . She found a can , popped the tab and brushed a loose strand of wig hair from her face . &quot; You ain ' t heard about her yet ? &quot; Caldonia shook her head . &quot; I can ' t keep_up with Clayton ' s women . It ' s enough to keep_up with three children. &quot; &quot; This one ' s different , &quot; said Vesta knowingly . &quot; And he ' s crazy about her , too. &quot; She paused , watching for Caldonia ' s reaction . &quot; Now I don ' t want to say something I shouldn ' t . . . . Mother said don ' t upset you . . . . &quot; &quot; Then don ' t , &quot; said Caldonia , rinsing_off her fingers at the sink . From the basement family_room came a whoop and a shout from Fred . &quot; Well , &quot; Vesta went_on , &quot; I haven ' t seen him like this with anybody for a while . She spends the night four , five times a week. &quot; &quot; What ? With you and the kids there ? &quot; Vesta nodded and swiped another olive . &quot; She ' s pretty and polite . Mother thinks so , too. &quot; &quot; Pretty and polite ! &quot; murmured Caldonia . &quot; You and Mother. &quot; Vesta seemed especially pleased with herself . &quot; There ' s something you won ' t like about her , but I ' ll let you find_out on your own. &quot; And she let_out a ladylike belch and squished the diet soda_can in her right fist . To herself , Caldonia murmured , &quot; Lord , Lord , Lord , &quot; and then , mercifully , the baby cried , and Caldonia excused herself and went upstairs . CLAYTON ARRIVED SHORTLY after 1:30 , sporting a new haircut and supporting Mother ' s stout , crooked body against his skeletal frame . He reminded Caldonia of a marionette , arms and legs dangling off the sides of his body as if held_on by wires . Nervous energy seemed to eat_up any pounds that might have settled onto his frail frame . Once , Caldonia had asked Mother about Clayton ' s puniness and his high voice , worried that Clayton was being denied entry to manhood , but Mother cut her short and asked her what on earth had gotten_into her , what could she possibly mean bringing_up something like that , was she trying to say her baby brother was gay ? Mother ' s eyes had hardened like marbles . No , that wasn ' t what Caldonia had meant at all , she ' d only said he was &quot; frail , &quot; but by then it was too late because Mother ' d already interpreted , in the narrowest terms available , what Caldonia meant about Mother ' s favorite child . &quot; He ' s a good son . He finished college . He ' s done_well for himself and he does_well by me . Don ' t you talk_about your brother that way. &quot; Clayton kissed Caldonia on the cheek , and now he was kissing Vesta , too . &quot; Let ' s see , it ' s been an hour since I ' ve seen you , &quot; he teased . &quot; Ha ha ha , &quot; murmured Vesta , unaware that her wig had slid an inch off her forehead and a portion of her mashed-down real hair was exposed . &quot; You ' re still pissed_off at the kids about that cold_cereal , I know you. &quot; Mother shot them both a look and said she needed to sit_down right away , she wasn ' t feeling right . They found her a comfortable spot on the new sectional sofa in front of the living room television , where she announced , &quot; Now , I don ' t want to look_at no football. &quot; Clayton crouched on the floor and began to search the channels . A quick perusal through the main networks produced mostly oversized men tumbling around in helmets . &quot; How about a parade ? &quot; Clayton suggested . &quot; Don ' t want to see a parade either . Just find something pleasant for me to look_at and turn_down the sound. &quot; Clayton settled_on a PBS travelogue of pubs in Ireland and got Mother adjusted . Caldonia brought_out glasses of fruit_juice for them both . &quot; Oh , goodness , you know I can ' t take ice , &quot; said Mother . Caldonia took the glass back to the sink and spooned out ice . There was just the slightest edge to her voice as she said , &quot; Vesta , take this back_out to Mother , please , and tell her it ' s good for her . Just a little cranberry_juice and orange_juice and some mineral water. &quot; Clayton hovered in the kitchen doorway , glass_in hand . His eyes seemed to burst from his eager light-brown face . &quot; Jill call yet ? &quot; he asked_in a voice meant to sound matter-of-fact but which came_out over-eager and tinged with plaintiveness . He had a nervous habit of rocking on his heels then rising onto his toes , as if in preparation for ascension . &quot; No , nobody ' s called , &quot; said Caldonia primly , wiping her hands on a kitchen towel . Vesta let_out a shriek . &quot; Ooooh , honey , and I called her Jane . Shoot , you know me , I ' m just bad with names . Guess I been so nervous I ' d call her Evelyn , I just don ' t call her by a name at all. &quot; Clayton ' s complexion went gray for a moment . He leaned_back hard on his heels , suddenly grounded . &quot; Vesta , you are something else , bringing_up Evelyn like that ! &quot; snapped Caldonia . Evelyn had been Clayton ' s fiancee the year before . A beauty queen , Miss Black Something or Other , standing over six feet tall , with legs like a giraffe ' s and eyes that had seen just a little too_much of life for Caldonia ' s taste . Evelyn Gilroy : the color of dark butterscotch with skin as smooth as silk and a set of thick eyelashes that swept across her cheeks , blinking like a doll each time anyone asked her something . &quot; I believe so , &quot; she ' d say if something was true . &quot; I believe not , &quot; she ' d say if something was false . And she ' d cold-shouldered Clayton ' s family , let them know they weren ' t really good_enough . But Clayton hadn ' t seen it coming , he never did . Evelyn kept him tied_up in a knot so tight he would n ' t eat , and he lost_weight and took_to having migraines . But like a fool he went_ahead and spent all his money on the diamond ring he placed on her finger . He saw engagement , a lifetime of long , brown Evelyn , his forever ; Evelyn saw only an expensive diamond . She had the gold melted_down after the breakup and put the diamond in a pendant . Caldonia had kept her mouth shut . &quot; Six things the Lord hates . . . a false_witness telling a pack of lies and one who stirs_up quarrels between brothers. &quot; She tried not to say anything bad about anybody . Clayton looked_at his watch . &quot; I ' d better try calling Jill again. &quot; &quot; Turkey ' s about ready , &quot; said Caldonia . &quot; And what did you bring for dinner , Mr. Clayton ? &quot; Clayton ' s eyes shot over to Vesta . &quot; Didn ' t Vesta bring my salad ? &quot; Caldonia turned , hand on hip , eyebrows arched . &quot; Well then , what did Miss Vesta bring ? &quot; &quot; Oh , shoot , &quot; Vesta moaned , without shame . &quot; I thought the salad was from all_of us . I mean , we live_in one place , me and Clayton and the kids . . . . &quot; &quot; But there are four people living there , &quot; Caldonia pointed_out , &quot; and that means four big appetites. &quot; &quot; I ' m sorry . I ' ve got so_much on my mind , &quot; sighed Vesta . &quot; Harold called this morning wanting to know what me and the kids were doing today . He ' s wanting to come_back . . . . &quot; &quot; I don ' t want to hear it , &quot; said Caldonia . Fred was cheering again from the family_room . Caldonia cast her eyes ceilingward . &quot; Now watch , the baby ' ll start crying any second. &quot; &quot; I ' ll get her ! &quot; said Clayton . &quot; You named her yet ? &quot; As predicted , the thin , high siren of Caldonia ' s newest addition scored the air . &quot; Oh , shoot , &quot; said Caldonia . &quot; I knew this would happen . Vesta , would you set the table , please. &quot; From the living room , Mother ' s voice rasped out , &quot; The baby ' s crying . Aren ' t we going_to eat sometime today ? &quot; Then the children surged through the back_door , all four of them , Iris announcing that she and Nadia were back and that Rosie had yanked the barrettes from her braids , Li ' l Harold was spitting on ants , and what was Caldonia going_to do about it ? Upstairs , Caldonia found relief from all_of their demands , lifting the pink and yellow fussing child from the little crib . Her watery blue eyes were squeezed into slits . Sensitivity to light , might lead to blindness . Keep her out of direct sunlight , protect her eyes and skin . She sounded like a houseplant , to be tended in the dark . Caldonia held her until the cries turned_to soft whimpers . &quot; There , there , sweetheart , &quot; she murmured . She carried the child down the back steps , avoiding the rest of the family , to where Fred sat on the edge of the family-room sofa . She handed the child to him . &quot; There ' s my little_girl , &quot; he said joyfully . His long-limbed dark body dwarfed the pale doll beside him . &quot; There ' s my little sweetheart. &quot; &quot; Everyone ' s here , &quot; said Caldonia . &quot; Shooooo , my little baby , &quot; he cooed into the child ' s ear and lay her against his thick , dark chest . &quot; My little Angela , my little Monica , my Little Bo-peep. &quot; Caldonia started_out the door , then turned and paused a moment . She was trying to make_sense out of Fred ' s long , milk-chocolate arms and the tiny , wriggling shrimp-like creature now being caressed , ever so gently , by his capable black_hands . I wonder , thought Caldonia , if I ' ll ever love her enough . It was an ugly , secret thought , one that haunted Caldonia with all its awful possibilities . THREE O ' CLOCK , AND Mother snored on the sofa . The turkey sat browned but untouched in its pan on top of the stove . The salad continued to wilt in the refrigerator . The table , arrayed with Caldonia ' s wedding china , held an air of empty expectation . The kids were snacking on peanut_butter and arguing over Chutes and Ladders on the dining_room floor . &quot; I really think we should go_ahead with dinner , &quot; Fred finally said , &quot; meaning no offense to your lady_friend , Clayton , but I don ' t want to hold things up any longer. &quot; Caldonia saw her brother ' s face fall . &quot; Maybe just a half hour more , &quot; she said sympathetically . &quot; You ' re sure she ' s got our number and the directions ? &quot; Clayton nodded . He sat hunched on a hassock in the living room , clasping and unclasping his hands , looking himself like a scolded child . The phone rang . Both Vesta and Clayton practically leaped from their seats . But it was only a friend of Fred ' s from the police_force . The baby ' s tiny bright pink face nestled itself against Caldonia ' s bosom . She squeezed the nameless child to her . The funny little face called to mind a newborn kitten ' s . Caldonia knew the family was talking behind her back . Even Fred was running_out of patience . She kept waiting for the name to announce itself , the way Iris ' and Nadia ' s names had . By 4 o ' clock , everyone was so bad-humored that Clayton finally gave_in and agreed they should eat , but his voice was tight and hollow when he spoke . &quot; Something must have happened to her , &quot; he said . &quot; I really wanted us all to eat together. &quot; Fred rounded_up the kids . The girls danced their way to the table ; the adults settled themselves somewhat grimly . There was a scraping of chairs and the usual compliments about how good everything looked . &quot; I don ' t know why we had to wait so_long , &quot; complained Mother . She surveyed the table with a critical eye . She focused in on Vesta , who was now holding the baby . &quot; Oh , there ' s my sweet little grandbaby. &quot; She looked the child up and down . &quot; When are they going_to find you a name , hmmmmm ? You ' ve got_to have a name . Such a shame , poor little thing ! &quot; &quot; I think my cousin ' s so pretty , &quot; said Rosie . &quot; Pretty cousin ! &quot; &quot; My sister ' s going_to be blond ! &quot; Iris explained . &quot; There ' s a girl at my school with really blond hair. &quot; She added exploratorily , &quot; The girl is white. &quot; &quot; Child needs a name , &quot; murmured Mother into her plate . &quot; It ' s been a month now. &quot; She looked_up hard at Fred . &quot; I thought you were going_to call her after your grandmother. &quot; &quot; Iris , eat your food , Iris , &quot; said Fred warningly to his daughter . Mother maintained her sharp stare . The doorbell rang . Almost quarter to 5 . Clayton leaped up and disappeared into the hallway . Fred caught Caldonia ' s eye and winked as if to say everything was all_right , she should ignore Mother , ignore them all . Caldonia could hear a woman ' s voice , hushed , then Clayton ' s , apologetic . A moment later , Clayton re-entered the dining_room with false cheer . &quot; Hey , hey hey ! &quot; he announced . &quot; Everyone , can I have your attention . I ' d like you all to meet someone . This is Jill. &quot; At first , Caldonia couldn ' t see much more_than a pair of brown boots and a long black coat , but when the woman stepped from the shadows , Caldonia was startled by her fine , straight hair the color of corn silk and skin the color of beaten egg_white . Caldonia immediately looked_at Mother for an explanation . But Mother was placidly spooning more oyster dressing into her mouth . &quot; You know Vesta and my mother , &quot; said Clayton , &quot; and this is my sister Caldonia and her husband , Fred. &quot; &quot; Hi , Jill , &quot; called Vesta cheerfully , then turned_to Caldonia with a sly smile . She was enjoying this moment thoroughly . &quot; Isn ' t she pretty ? I told you she was so pretty , &quot; she observed for Jill ' s benefit . Caldonia sat stunned . She felt betrayed , by Clayton , by Vesta , but most of all by Mother , who went right on eating . Vesta ' s ignorance could almost be excused ; the girl was color struck , thought all white_women were pretty , had been that way since she was a child . When she watched old black-and-white movies , she was always sighing over old pale-white , dead actresses . Fred got_up from the table and took Jill ' s coat . Clayton pulled_out the empty chair at the end of the table for her , and Jill set_about squeezing herself in between Nadia and Iris . Still , Caldonia hadn ' t said a word . &quot; Let her see the baby ! &quot; cried Vesta . &quot; Show Jill the baby ! &quot; &quot; Let her get settled first , &quot; Caldonia murmured . &quot; She doesn ' t need to be bothered with the baby. &quot; She felt suddenly proprietary toward her child . But Vesta was_on a roll . &quot; Ask Jill what she thinks_about the baby. &quot; Anger rose in Caldonia . &quot; I don ' t need to ask Jill anything , &quot; was what came_out of her mouth , and Mother ' s head shot_up like a bullet . Vesta didn ' t seem to care . &quot; Now that I think_about it , &quot; she grinned , &quot; that could be Jill ' s baby. &quot; Clayton was trying to change the subject , but Jill interrupted . Her voice , when she spoke , had that sharp bell-like sound like so many white_women ' s . &quot; Clayton told me you just had a baby . Congratulations. &quot; &quot; Thank you , &quot; said Caldonia , surprised by her own relief . Vesta would n ' t let_up . &quot; Jill , look_at this pretty child my sister has . She ' s got your coloring. &quot; Clayton went_to work fixing Jill a plate . &quot; Turkey ? Cranberry_sauce ? Gravy ? &quot; He went_down the list with an eagerness that filled Caldonia with loathing . Jill murmured , &quot; Clayton , not so_much , you know I ' ve already eaten. ' Already eaten ! Caldonia thought ; well , knock me over with a feather . Already eaten ! This , while everyone had waited so patiently , the kids getting fussier and hungrier . As if in sympathy , the baby let_out a long wail on Caldonia ' s lap . &quot; Mama ! &quot; cried Iris and Nadia simultaneously . &quot; The baby ' s crying. &quot; It felt_like an accusation . &quot; Bring the poor little thing over to me , &quot; said Mother . &quot; Let me hold her. &quot; Caldonia snapped back , &quot; Not now , she needs to be fed. &quot; The baby began to howl full force . It was as if all_the tension in the room had settled over her and drawn her little face into tight , red fury . Jill asked Clayton to please sit_down and not worry over her . Caldonia had a sudden image of Jill emerging from her brother ' s bedroom and traipsing into the bathroom , dressed only in her panties and bra , in front of the children . Caldonia alternated between fury with Clayton and fury with the girl . Fred turned_to Caldonia . &quot; Honey , want me to take the baby downstairs with me ? &quot; &quot; I ' ll keep her , &quot; said Caldonia . She got_up from the table . &quot; Isn ' t she just the prettiest little thing ? &quot; Vesta prodded Jill . &quot; I think she ' s so cute . &quot; &quot; She ' s sweet , &quot; Jill agreed , but she was staring hopelessly at the mounds of turkey and dressing Clayton had heaped on her plate . &quot; I told you the baby was cute , didn ' t I ? &quot; said Clayton , as if to leave no doubt about what he might have said about the child . Then , for Jill ' s benefit , he launched into his version of how he ' d been the one to get Caldonia to the hospital just in time . &quot; Don ' t be tellin ' her that , &quot; said Mother , biting into a turkey_wing . &quot; Your sister was in_labor for almost 18 hours before that Chinese lady did something about it. &quot; &quot; Mo-ther , &quot; warned Caldonia . Jill tentatively reached_out one pale hand and touched the baby ' s blanched skin . &quot; I don ' t get_to see newborns very often , &quot; she said . &quot; Let her hold the baby , &quot; insisted Vesta . Her eyes had gone round and bright . The baby stopped crying . &quot; Jill ' s eating , &quot; said Caldonia , pulling the baby back against her body . &quot; The baby ' s too fussy. &quot; &quot; No , it ' s OK , &quot; said Jill . She was working so hard at being polite . Now Clayton was urging . &quot; Come on , Caldonia , let Jill hold the baby. &quot; Caldonia could see she had no choice without offending everyone . She leaned down and handed the baby to Jill . Jill gathered the child against her and rocked gently from side to side , &quot; Mmmmm , she ' s so little. &quot; Caldonia arranged the loose-knit blanket around the baby ' s body . &quot; Look_at Jill holding the baby , &quot; commented Mother , her turkey_leg held_up in one hand . &quot; Isn ' t that something. &quot; &quot; The baby could be hers , &quot; said Vesta . Caldonia caught Fred ' s eye and saw a warning there . &quot; They sure look a lot alike , &quot; Mother went_on , hope in her voice . She leaned across the table and studied first the baby ' s face , then Jill ' s . &quot; They got that same pretty complexion , don ' t you think so , Clayton ? What do you think , Jill ? Is that a pretty baby to you ? &quot; Jill was trying to be polite for them all . &quot; What ' s her name ? &quot; she asked . A moment of silence followed . &quot; She doesn ' t have one , &quot; Mother said bitterly . &quot; It ' s been a month now , and Caldonia can ' t decide what to call it. &quot; Caldonia felt heat rise to her face . She snapped back , &quot; The baby ' s albino , &quot; as if that answered anything . She meant the word to sound bold , even cruel , despite the fact that the Lord would be shaking His head at her . Clayton jumped in . &quot; What Sis means is that she ' s not sure if the baby ' s eyes will have sensitivity to light . . . . &quot; &quot; that ' s not what I mean at all , &quot; Caldonia said matter-of-factly . &quot; I mean what I said ; I ' m upset my baby is white. &quot; It was the first time she ' d actually said it . Not to Fred , not even to herself . But now it seemed like the most natural thing to say . The room grew very still . Fred cleared his throat . Mother murmured , &quot; Hmmmmm mmmmmm ! &quot; disapprovingly under her breath . The children eyeballed one another with keen interest . But Jill didn ' t seem to mind . She looked straight back in Caldonia ' s face . &quot; Isn ' t the albino trait inherited ? &quot; she asked . Caldonia nodded . &quot; It ' s from Fred ' s side. &quot; &quot; I still think she ' s pretty , &quot; defended Vesta . &quot; Maybe she ' ll grow_up and look_like Jill. &quot; &quot; Being albino , &quot; said Caldonia , &quot; is different from being . . . . &quot; She paused . She saw no point in offending Jill . &quot; A blond nappy head just isn ' t pretty , &quot; Caldonia heard herself saying . &quot; that ' s called funny-looking. &quot; Everyone laughed , except Mother , who pursed her lips and said softly , &quot; Y ' all some wrong folks ! &quot; Caldonia bent down and retrieved the baby from Jill . &quot; I ' m afraid she ' ll spit_up all_over you , &quot; she said with false concern . &quot; She looks_like she might. &quot; &quot; Maybe everybody ' ll think the baby ' s mulatto , &quot; said Vesta , her mouth full of stuffing . &quot; that ' s what they call a white and black mix . You know , like you and Clayton. &quot; She used her fork to gesture toward Jill , as if joining her with Clayton in midair . &quot; Clayton and Jill are not mulatto , &quot; Caldonia said stonily . She felt her anger giving her direction . &quot; Clayton is black , and Jill is white . Mulatto would be what they ' d have if they had a child , Vesta . It ' s not the same thing. &quot; &quot; Hold_on there , don ' t rush us now , &quot; said Clayton , but he said it only for Jill ' s sake . His smile had broadened , his eyes brightened . Caldonia could see he rather liked the idea of having a child with Jill . And she could see by Jill ' s tense but civil expression that this would never happen . &quot; I don ' t mean nothin ' , &quot; said Vesta cheerfully . She grinned at Jill . &quot; You know me , I ' m just over here runnin ' my mouth like I usually do . My best_friend in grade_school was white . ' Member her , Caldonia ? Patty what ' s-her-face , that big old fat girl , pretty face though. &quot; The baby began to fuss in Caldonia ' s arms . Her bad humor quickly escalated to rage , and her face turned the color of Pepto-Bismol . Caldonia excused herself . &quot; Feed the baby here , &quot; Clayton called after her . But the truth was , Caldonia didn ' t want to nurse her youngest child near a stranger . She pulled shut the louvered doors that separated the kitchen and dining_room . She sat_down in one of the vinyl-backed kitchen chairs and arranged the baby ' s pink mouth at her brown breast . The louvered doors opened ever so slightly and Fred squeezed through . If he was annoyed with Caldonia he didn ' t show it . Instead , he bent down and kissed the nursing baby . &quot; You know I love you , &quot; he whispered in her tiny shell-pink ear , &quot; even if your mama ' s actin ' crazy. &quot; Caldonia had to smile in spite of herself . She hummed softly to the pink and yellow child . When Fred went_out again , Caldonia caught_a_glimpse of Clayton ' s slender brown fingers caressing Jill ' s pale arm , and the stiffening of that arm as Jill carefully and surreptitiously moved just out_of_reach . It was a simple gesture , designed not to embarrass Clayton in front of his family . Caldonia looked down at her youngest daughter . She didn ' t know which was worse , going_through life toward blindness or going_through life white . In a way , it was kind of the same thing . How was her daughter going_to feel , this little pale stalk in a dark field ? Iris and Nadia let themselves into the kitchen . &quot; Close the door ! &quot; Caldonia hissed . &quot; Mama , we love our sister , &quot; said Iris pointedly . &quot; Well , of course you do ! &quot; Caldonia hadn ' t meant to give the girls a wrong impression . &quot; We could put her in the sun , &quot; suggested Nadia helpfully . &quot; She could get a tan and be like us. &quot; The two girls ran their hands_over the baby ' s little pink ones and cooed at her . &quot; She is like us , &quot; Caldonia corrected . &quot; She is us. &quot; &quot; Excuse me . . . . &quot; Caldonia ' s head shot_up . The voice was clear and precise . It was Jill , first poking her head through the kitchen door and then standing_in the kitchen doorway , small and white , not much taller than Nadia and Iris . Caldonia quickly covered her breast . &quot; I want to thank_you for having me , &quot; Jill said softly . &quot; And I ' m sorry about all_the inconvenience and the mix-up. &quot; For a moment , before she was able to line_up her thoughts , Caldonia actually thought the girl was apologizing for the absence of the baby ' s color . &quot; The mix-up ? &quot; said Caldonia vaguely . She reached for the right words . &quot; Clayton ' s friends are always welcome , &quot; she said . &quot; Come_back any time. &quot; &quot; I will. &quot; The girl smiled , and Caldonia knew they both were thinking how this would not happen . &quot; Thank you , &quot; said the girl , relieved and forgiven , as if Caldonia had the power to do that . THAT NIGHT , WHEN THE DISHES had been washed , the kitchen swept and the children put to bed , Caldonia asked Fred tentatively , &quot; Do you think it would be foolish to name the baby Ebony ? &quot; Fred burst_out laughing . &quot; Girl , what are you talking_about ? &quot; &quot; I want to give my child a real name , &quot; said Caldonia . &quot; that ' s real all_right , &quot; he chuckled . &quot; What is wrong with you , Caldonia ? You can ' t make her black , you know . Naming her Ebony is as bad as naming a dark child Pearl , or Magnolia . We should call her Angela , after my grandmother. &quot; &quot; I just want her to know . . . . &quot; Caldonia began stupidly , &quot; I just want her to feel . . . . &quot; Fred looked_at her long and hard . &quot; She is , Caldonia , &quot; was all he said before he went upstairs and turned_on the news . Caldonia stood next to the sink under the framed &quot; God Bless This Mess &quot; sampler Mother had made_for her last Christmas . God , thought Caldonia wistfully , in His infinite wisdom , has given me this child without a name . She wasn ' t blaming God ; she wasn ' t blaming anyone but herself for the mean pinch in her heart that prevented her from running right upstairs and calling the child by her rightful name .</TEXT>
