   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW ; FIRE_CHIEF STRESSES COMMUNICATION , PRECAUTIONS IN HEAT OF BATTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles County firefighters are gearing_up for what could be another tough wildfire season in the Southland this fall . It is coming only two months after 14 firefighters died July 6 near the center of a wildfire in western Colorado . Federal authorities later concluded that human errors contributed to the disaster . The errors included a failure to set_up adequate escape routes and safety_zones and a lack of communication among firefighting organizations . Los Angeles County last year had the biggest fires in the area ' s history . They raged from the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains to the Malibu hillsides overlooking the Pacific_Ocean . This year , county firefighters will bring some new equipment into the fray , including the CL-215T , usually referred to as the Super Scooper , an airplane that can scoop_up to 14 # 000 gallons of water in a single pass as it flies a_few feet above a large body_of_water . Even with the latest high-tech aids , firefighters ' fate can be decided by a barely noticeable shift in the wind or a garbled or slightly misunderstood communication , county Fire_Chief P . Michael Freeman explained in an interview with staff writer Chip Johnson . * Question : About two months ago , a Colorado fire killed 14 firefighters . Will you be looking_into that fire ? What kind of precautions do you take_to guard against that kind of disaster ? Answer : We will be looking_at the Colorado report , and we will share the information we learn with our employees . What is always primary is to allow_for safety margins . In a wildfire situation , the fire can be so easily and quickly affected by the weather , the subtleties . A slight shift in the wind can turn a lazily burning fire into an inferno . What we do is teach , we train , we drill on the basic rules of engagement . We talk_about the types of situations that we should watch for , and we rely heavily on good communications . When a crew is out working_on a wildlife fire , there are many other resources , crews and equipment working_on the fire , and it ' s crucial that they talk to each other and stay in good coordination . Given all_of that , a situation can occur that can cause a fire to blow_up , and we train to have a safe refuge area , a point everyone can get_to safely that is adequate for their safety . We use aluminized protective shelters . In the worst-case scenario , you have to deploy that shelter , which takes about half a minute , and it takes practice , practice and more practice . Q : What about communications with air support and men on the ground ? A : We basically have three layers , communications on the ground and ground to air helicopters and a line of communication between the helicopters and outside agency tanker aircraft . What we have to do sometimes to is bridge communications between the air tankers and the commanders on the ground . Sometimes the commander will talk to the helicopter and then relay that information to the air_attack . But generally where most of our communication occurs is between ground forces and our own helicopter force . Sometimes the helicopter crews are talking to hand crews , supervisors and foremen in many cases . Q : Why is that ? A : In a brush_fire , without structures being threatened , the crew is doing the real work , trying to cut a line around the fire . The helicopters drop water in front of that line . Crews keep one foot in the black area and one foot outside the burn . There is some degree of safety in the burn area . I have to qualify that because the steepness of the terrain may have a bearing as well as the intensity of the fire . It sometimes isn ' t humanly possible to stay there because of the sheer heat . You ' re so close to where it has burned , the ground , the rocks are so hot you couldn ' t touch them . If you had to stay_on the ground for more_than a minute , you would probably get burned through your suit by the radiant heat . You ' re as close to the fire as you can get . The idea is to scratch the line around the fire . In combat , we try to cut a sufficiently wide line to stop the fire but not as deep as when we improve the line once we get_a_line around the fire . Q : What happened in Altadena last year , when two firefighters died ? A : This was the fire that ultimately came_down and burned 155 homes and burned for several days . It was the first major loss fire of the year in L.A. County . The crews had to deploy their shelters . It was a critical situation . It was a case where the wind and terrain gave them no choice other_than to deploy . Basically what happened is a fire had burned_up a side of the canyon rapidly . We didn ' t have high winds , but it was a combination of topography and light winds . It ran_up one side of the canyon , and a crew was working its way down from the top . They had cut a line from the head of the fire , working with helicopters . The crew appeared to be safe , but their vision was obstructed by the nob of the_hill that stuck_out . The terrain was very steep , and they had a lookout in position to try and look_around the nob . But it turned_out in retrospect that the lookout ' s vision was cut_off as well . A small , undetected amount of fire was below them and around the nob . They were_on a west slope , and the fire came_up the east slope , and as the fire made its run , and it was intense , part of the fire hooked around the nob and came toward them . They had one foot in the black , and they were cutting a line below fuel , and there was just instantaneously a wall of heat and fire across the crew . They were advised to retreat and they did , but four of them were trapped and caught by the flames . Two of them were seriously burned , and two others , due_to smoke inhalation , succumbed to their injuries . Q : Have there been more or fewer prescribed burns this year ? A : We burned less this year than last year , because of all_the hot_weather . We ' ve had more_than 12 days of prescribed burns canceled this year because of the weather . I was at one of these prescribed burns , and they had to call it off because of high_temperatures and low humidity . There is no guarantee we will meet our goal , which this year was between 3 # 000 and 5 # 000 acres . One of the things we are looking_at is , are there other ways to crush this fuel . One way is to change its configuration to make_it burn less rapidly and easier to control . The way the fuel is arranged when it ' s straight up allows it to burn at its strongest configuration . Q : What about the areas hardest hit by fire last year ? A : In those areas , the hazards of big fires would be substantially less . Some rejuvenation has begun , but it will be many years before there is fuel like there was a year ago . There are still thousands and thousands of acres that remain as a serious threat to homes and businesses . Q : Are there areas this year that are being closely monitored ? A : Well , all_of the brush areas that expose homes and structures -- the La Crescenta , La Canada-Flintridge areas . Parts of Altadena , the Santa Monica Mountains including Malibu , Calabasas and the Agoura Hills area . Santa Clarita and certainly parts of Antelope Valley , which have been spared , but about three weeks ago we had the Leona Valley fire . Q : What kinds of conditions exist this year for another round of major wildfires ? A : We ' ve had a number of fires already . The fuel is dry . The live fuel moisture is at a lower level than it was at this point last year , which is not surprising when you consider the repeated heat_waves we ' ve had this year . On the positive side , we have been working closely with communities that are close to the brush and have been advising them of the dangers and encouraging them to help us clear brush and fuel . We ' ve done massive mailing reminding them about defensible spaces around their homes . Q : What is new about dispatch practices this year ? A : When a fire is reported , when anyone requests a second alarm , our dispatch center makes a call to a fixed-wing tanker . That was not automatic last year . The best thing we can do for safety is to knock these things down fast , and I ' m looking_for new ways to deploy old tools . The newest thing we ' re looking_at is the CL-215T . It ' s commonly referred to as the Super Scooper . It ' s our newest tool . The idea is to get this plane and its crew and the helicopters to the scene within 20 minutes . The aircraft can scoop_up to 14 # 000 gallons of water , moving at more_than 100 m.p.h. within 10 seconds . But they cost $ 17 million . Q : What other precautions have you taken this year ? A : We formed the Wildlife Safety Panel , which was commissioned by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last year . It is made_up of professionals from all_over who looked_at structures , water_supply , brush clearance and other safety measures . The study made 40 recommendations , and we have implemented a number of them . We also have implemented Operation Firestop , which is primarily members of my staff that I put into a task_force to deal with operational departmental procedures , training , updating an attack plan , accessing swimming_pool water better -- a whole host of things , including the helicopters and first response . We ' re trying to improve ourselves from what we ' ve learned and do our damnedest to do_better . We stop more_than 90 % of most brush_fires before they get rolling , but those aren ' t the ones that make the news . The majority of the ones we handle aren ' t the ones that made headline news . The ones that made the news were the ones pushed by Santa Ana winds , and this year we ' re trying to do everything humanly possible to look Mother Nature in the eye when she brings that Santa Ana and win that battle .</TEXT>
