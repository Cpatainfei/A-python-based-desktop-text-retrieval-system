   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS SILENCE THE KILLING FIELDS ; S . AFRICA : INKATHA DECISION TO END BOYCOTT HAS NATAL PROVINCE BUSY WITH POLITICAL DOINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sam Nxumalo once campaigned warily for the African National Congress here on the lush , green hills where the Inkatha Freedom Party is strong -- his own name rides a widely circulated hit list and violence has been a fact of life . But Friday he decided to make a weekend campaign swing into two nearby Inkatha-controlled townships , confident that the ANC-Inkatha bloodshed is , if not over , at least taking a pause before next week ' s elections . &quot; I ' m going_to go_to the people , &quot; said Nxumalo , a 36-year-old professional nurse and the ANC ' s leader in this , one of the most turbulent sub-regions of Natal province . &quot; Things have changed here in the past few days , and I want to test the waters . I ' m not so scared anymore. &quot; The killing fields of Natal , scene of 14 # 000 political slayings since President Frederik W . de Klerk first began to dismantle apartheid four years ago , are mostly silent now , save for the sounds of politicians on the hustings and election officials teaching people how to vote . The face of Inkatha President Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi appears on campaign posters , often tacked to lampposts next to pictures of ANC President Nelson Mandela . Excitement has replaced fear across vast sections of the region . And the talk in both camps is of political , not military victory . At Inkatha campaign headquarters in Durban , the effects of Buthelezi ' s decision to abandon his election boycott and urge his supporters to vote was clearly evident Friday . Thousands of newly minted posters were being dispatched to the far reaches of the province as staff_members worked furiously at computers and the telephone rang constantly . &quot; It ' s been crazy here , &quot; said Ziba Jiyane , Inkatha ' s national political director . A few moments earlier , he had been_on the telephone himself , begging the South_African Broadcasting Co . to change its decision to stop all political advertising at midnight Saturday . &quot; We ' re begging for the whole day of Sunday , &quot; he said to an SABC official on the telephone . &quot; We ' re desperately in need of more advertising time . Please . Please. &quot; With Sunday designated as the last legal day for campaigning , all_the parties are racing to get their message out . That is especially true in Natal province , where Inkatha ' s boycott had made_it impossible for ANC leaders to campaign in dozens of communities . And many potential voters had been afraid even to consider voting because of possible revenge attacks . Election officials , who had been prevented from creating polling_stations in Natal areas controlled by chiefs loyal to Inkatha , now plan 1 # 500 sites , up from 1 # 000 . About 200 of them will be mobile units . And virtually every one of the province ' s 6.5 million residents will be able to walk to the polls . Both the ANC and Inkatha are hoping that the elections , by secret_ballot , will now reflect their true support in areas controlled by the other side . Independent opinion polls in Natal suggest that the ANC will win 50 % of the vote , compared to Inkatha ' s 19 % . ( Most polls give the ANC a 50 % or better nationwide vote , compared to 5 % or less for Inkatha , whose support lies primarily in Natal. ) But polls are not very reliable in Natal , where thousands do not have telephones and many_more are afraid to reveal how they will vote . Buthelezi , on the campaign trail Friday , predicted that his party will &quot; win enough votes to take its place in a government of national unity , &quot; but he added that he will refuse to become part of any such government . In the Eshowe area , about 120 miles northwest of Durban , the race is likely to be close between Inkatha , the ANC and the liberal Democratic Party , which is supported by white farmers here . Election officials only planned to open 11 polls in the area , which has about 100 # 000 potential voters . But chiefs supporting Inkatha now have welcomed polling_stations in their communities , and 67 polling sites are planned . &quot; We still have a chance of winning here , &quot; the ANC ' s Nxumalo said . &quot; All this time , people have been suppressed by Inkatha . They could not express their views . And we believe many of them support us . They are fed up with Inkatha , and especially the chiefs. &quot; Nxumalo hopes to increase ANC support when he takes his party ' s promises of electricity , running water and paved roads into the Inkatha-held areas . &quot; we ' ll just go and start speaking , &quot; he said . ' I don ' t think there is anyone from Inkatha who would attack me. &quot; Of course , the ANC and Inkatha blame each other for the violence . And Jiyane , the Inkatha political_leader , said tensions have diminished because &quot; our enemies believe they can defeat us at the polls. &quot; But at the moment , the Inkatha political_campaign is in disarray . It will be able to rely_on its large network of chiefs and other party workers to help get people to the polls . But party leaders , working around the clock , are plagued by disagreements over how to use the few days remaining before the election . &quot; We don ' t have time for a learning curve , &quot; Jiyane said . &quot; There ' s disagreement about where to focus our energies. &quot; Will the peace hold ? No one knows for_sure . The violence in Natal was common long before any elections were planned , fed by political disagreement but also by the apartheid system , clan feuds and unknown forces trying to destabilize the country . But the elections , if they are judged free and fair , will mark the first time in the region ' s history that the mostly Zulu province has been able to choose sides democratically . And if the loser abides by the results , ANC and Inkatha leaders here believe that the peace may hold . Said Jiyane : &quot; There are no losers if lives are saved. &quot;</TEXT>
