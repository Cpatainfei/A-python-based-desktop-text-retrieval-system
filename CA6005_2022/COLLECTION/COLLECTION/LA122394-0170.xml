   <HEADLINE> THE GOODS ; A QUICKER RESOLUTION OR SETTLING FOR LESS ? ; HEALTH : AS MORE DOCTORS REQUIRE ARBITRATION HEARINGS RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS , SOME OBSERVERS WONDER IF PATIENTS ' BEST INTERESTS ARE BEING SERVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fran and Keith Gochmanosky wanted justice . Their 9-year-old son had undergone surgery to have 70 % of his tongue removed because his pediatrician had overlooked a tumor in the boy ' s mouth . Distraught over the realization that their son would be haunted throughout his life -- every time he speaks , interviews for a job or kisses a girl -- the Gochmanoskys decided to take the doctor to court . Only then did they learn that when they signed_up with their HMO several years earlier , they had unknowingly given_up their right to a trial by jury as part of their contract . Instead , they had to settle their differences through private arbitration . &quot; I had no idea we had to use arbitration , &quot; says Fran Gochmanosky , who lives_in San Diego with her husband and son , now 12 . &quot; I had no idea what arbitration was. &quot; A panel of arbitrators eventually sided with the Gochmanoskys , who would not reveal the exact settlement amount . And while they are pleased with the outcome , they say a jury might have awarded their son a lot more money -- perhaps the full $ 3 million they asked_for . &quot; And he deserves every penny , &quot; says Fran Gochmanosky , whose son sees a speech_therapist . &quot; We went_through living hell , and my son is going_to suffer for the rest of his life. &quot; Increasingly , patients -- knowingly and unknowingly -- are signing_away their rights to take a doctor to court for malpractice . Today , most California health_maintenance_organizations -- as well as_many private doctors -- require patients to sign binding arbitration agreements . While all sides agree that the process reduces legal_fees and speeds resolution of a case , opinion is divided as_to whether arbitration serves the patient ' s best interests . &quot; From the perspective of the insurance_company or the large health plan , arbitration is a great idea , &quot; says Will Clark , a Torrance attorney who represents plaintiffs and defendants in malpractice cases . &quot; But from the patient ' s standpoint , I have strong reservations . A jury trial has been recognized since our nation ' s founding as a very important right . We all ought to be very suspicious when someone trades us anything for it , &quot; says Clark , who has also served as an arbitrator . &quot; Look_at what juries have awarded on some lifetime disability or birth injury cases . It can come_into the tens of millions of dollars . It is unlikely that arbitration would get_to those levels , &quot; he says . But such massive judgments are part of the problem -- and one of the reasons arbitration exists , according to Dr. Mitchell Karlan , a Beverly Hills cancer surgeon and board_member of the Southern California Physicians Insurance Exchange . &quot; So many physicians get hit with lawsuits that don ' t deal with merit , facts or hard evidence , and lawyers , who have their fingers in the honey pot , have a field_day . They play the jury like a violin string . So many frivolous claims raise the cost of medical care. &quot; Still , Karlan says he no longer advocates arbitration in malpractice cases . After about 15 years of requiring arbitration agreements in his office , Karlan abandoned the contracts several years ago when he realized his patients ' &quot; distaste &quot; for the forms . &quot; Even before my patients saw me , they were hit with a legal commitment . I didn ' t like the feeling it gave them . They have enough to worry about , with a lump in their breast , a hernia or a thyroid problem , &quot; he says . &quot; Those papers tainted our relationship. &quot; But Dr. Daryl Alexander , a Tarzana obstetrician-gynecologist , believes arbitration benefits all parties . &quot; I wish I didn ' t have to introduce legal topics into my relationships with patients , &quot; she says . &quot; I would like to confine my discussion to medicine , which is my expertise and interest . I wish we did not live_in a litigious society . But since we do , I feel more comfortable knowing that we are not going_to spend a whole_lot of dollars on lawsuits . Arbitration is a way to simplify the medical-legal process and keep costs down. &quot; According to Alexander , the vast majority of her patients sign the arbitration form without a murmur of complaint . &quot; Interestingly , &quot; she says , &quot; it is never my patients who are lawyers or judges who resist . It is usually people who don ' t understand what arbitration is. &quot; The problem is that most patients don ' t know what they are signing_away , says Virginia Nelson , a San Diego attorney who represented the Gochmanoskys . &quot; Before people make a decision , they should be informed -- but they are not . They get handed this form as they walk in. &quot; However , Nelson added that she signs arbitration forms herself . &quot; I have no fear of the process , &quot; she says . &quot; The jury trial is not necessarily the only just way to resolve a case . Courts are crowded ; cases take a long_time to get_to trial ; they are very expensive . Arbitration is an alternative method of disposing_of disputes . If a patient wants treatment by this doctor , I say , ' Sign it. ' &quot; Once signed , the contracts cover all care a patient receives by that provider -- forever . The form also states that if a pregnant woman signs the contract , her unborn child is bound by it . If a patient signs the agreement and subsequently dies as a result of negligence or malpractice , the surviving family members are also bound to the terms of the contract . A person who signs an arbitration agreement , then has a change of heart , may cancel the contract by notifying the provider in writing within 30 days -- something many doctors say virtually no patients do . After 30 days have elapsed , getting_out of the contract is virtually impossible , unless the other party decides not to enforce it . &quot; The binding nature of these agreements have been upheld in all court decisions in the last decade , &quot; says Elizabeth Rolph , a senior political_scientist at RAND , a Santa Monica think_tank . In a typical medical malpractice arbitration , both the patient and physician are represented by an attorney of their choice . Each side picks an arbitrator -- called a &quot; party arbitrator &quot; -- and the two party arbitrators together select a third , neutral arbitrator . Since party arbitrators are likely to favor their respective sides , the neutral arbitrator often casts the tie-breaking vote that decides the outcome of the case . Once a decision is made in arbitration , it may_not be appealed . The arbitration process is generally less formal than a courtroom trial . &quot; Arbitrators are not as concerned with procedures as they are with getting_to the meat of the issue , &quot; says William Goldsmith , a Tarzana malpractice attorney . &quot; Arbitrators may take_over questioning of witnesses , and a jury can ' t do that . A witness , for example , may be talking_about how wonderful this doctor is , and all_the arbitrators are interested in knowing is what angle a ligament was sliced , &quot; he says . Most legal_experts agree that arbitrators , who are usually attorneys or retired judges , are less likely to be swayed by emotion -- which is why some people believe a patient , especially one who was catastrophically injured , has a better chance of winning big in a jury trial . &quot; Juries tend to be more sympathetic than arbitrators , and I think that is good , &quot; says Woodland Hills attorney John O ' Meara . &quot; Who is to say that people who base cases on sympathy are not correct ? There are juries that occasionally run amok , but it is amazing how often they are right . From what I have seen , plaintiffs do a lot better in jury trials. &quot; Nelson , the attorney who represented the Gochmanosky family , isn ' t so sure . &quot; By and large my clients walk away ( from arbitrations ) thinking it was a fair process , &quot; she says . &quot; But it ' s a crap shoot with a jury : You have no way of knowing who these 12 people are . Some have a very strong bias in favor of the medical_profession . And if you do get a verdict , you may_not collect it because of the appellate process. &quot; So what ' s better for the patient : Arbitration or a jury trial ? There is really no good way to compare a person ' s chances of winning one way or the other , according to Rolph . For one thing , most cases destined for court settle before ever reaching trial , as the defense does not want to risk getting hit with huge damages . A much greater proportion of cases go_to arbitration , where runaway awards are rare . And because arbitration proceedings are private , getting information on them is difficult . &quot; There are no public records of arbitration proceedings , &quot; Rolph says , &quot; so you have big problems in terms of getting data and drawing conclusions. &quot;</TEXT>
