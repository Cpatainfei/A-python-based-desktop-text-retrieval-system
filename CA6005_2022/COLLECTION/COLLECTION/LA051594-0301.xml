   <HEADLINE> PASADENA TAKES SOBERING APPROACH TOWARD CRIME ; COMMUNITY : CITING THE LINK BETWEEN LIQUOR AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITY , THE CITY IS DRAWING_UP ITS OWN POLICY TO CRACK_DOWN ON STORES THAT SELL ALCOHOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A middle-aged man hunches_over the wall along the Orange Grove Boulevard side of the Rancho Super Market on Fair Oaks Avenue . He pauses for a moment and then vomits into the bushes and onto the sidewalk . It ' s about 1:30 on a hazy Wednesday afternoon . This is one of the sights on Eric McWilliams ' guided tour of notorious booze-soaked spots in Northwest Pasadena -- an area he grew_up in and still patrols as a community relations police_officer . There are many landmarks of trouble . &quot; We had a murder there recently , &quot; McWilliams says as he cruises by the Liquor Box on north Lincoln Avenue near Orange Grove . The problems in Pasadena were noted in a recent study of two separate two-week periods that found that half of all arrests in the city -- and all homicide arrests -- involved alcohol . City officials have grown so appalled by the link between alcohol and crime , especially in areas dense with liquor outlets , that an innovative but legally risky approach is being prepared . It will seek to penalize liquor_stores and bars that breed crime and violence . On March 29 , the Pasadena City_Council voted to have the Planning_Commission draw_up the specifics of a citywide alcohol policy . A pillar of the policy will be a nuisance abatement ordinance giving the city authority to penalize or close problem outlets . The policy would also set zoning limits on the number of bars and liquor_stores in an effort to control areas deemed to be saturated , especially Old Town and Northwest Pasadena , which have the city ' s greatest concentrations of liquor establishments . The proposal would put the city on the edge of regulating liquor_stores , which is the responsibility of the state_Department of Alcoholic_Beverage Control . A similar ordinance in Oakland was overturned by the courts after a suit by the California Beverage Retailer Coalition . But an ordinance in Los Angeles survived a legal challenge . Pasadena leaders say they have no choice but to act . The state agency lacks the staffing to ensure that licensees are not selling to minors or allowing aggressive panhandling , loitering , fights or drug sales around their premises , city officials say . The case of Uno Mas , a tavern on Lake Avenue , exemplifies the pace at which the ABC collars renegade bars , local leaders say . After two years of neighborhood lobbying against the bar , the ABC worked_out a deal with the owner for Uno Mas to move_out of Pasadena by June 17 , 1994 . Groups such_as the Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn . complained that Uno Mas was a persistent source of public drunkenness , public urination , noise , fights and complaints of lewd behavior . &quot; It was just kind of a source of varied problems , &quot; said ABC enforcement supervisor Judy Matty . &quot; It was a matter of accumulating enough evidence to take action. &quot; Uno Mas owner Maria Lopez denied that her bar is a source of problems and defended her clientele as law-abiding , working people . &quot; An injustice has been done to me , &quot; Lopez said . &quot; I think some administrator wants me to move for another reason . They want the space for something else. &quot; In 1988 , Pasadena began issuing conditional use permits for alcohol outlets . The permits set a wide range of performance criteria -- such_as limits on cooler or bar space , operating hours and controlling loitering -- that stores and bars must meet in_order to get a license within the city . The city has the authority to act against outlets that fail to meet their conditions . But officials had no tools to use against the source of most problems , stores that opened before 1988 . Cities do , however , have the power to control public nuisances . The new ordinance would place troublesome liquor establishments under that power , allowing the city to slap new operating conditions on the store or bar . Any establishment that fails to comply could be closed . The new law also would enable the city to limit the number of alcohol outlets ; although details are still being worked_out by the Planning_Commission , the city plans to force new applicants within 200 or 300 feet of existing alcohol outlets to prove that their establishment would benefit the community . Planning Administrator Denver Miller said several municipal and zoning codes must be amended to enact these measures . He expects the Planning_Commission to begin writing the new policies in June . &quot; We are not talking_about prohibition , despite the impact the abuse of alcohol has in our society , &quot; Mayor Rick Cole said . &quot; It is widely and readily available and socially acceptable , but at the fringes it has a tremendous impact on safety . It is the single biggest drain on our public resources. &quot; Many liquor_store owners agree that troublemakers tend to hang_out near their stores , but say there is little they can do . Scott VanDenHende , manager of Rancho Super Market , said that he attempted to discourage problem customers by boosting prices on the single cans of potent malt beers and bottles of fortified wines that are local favorites . But that hasn ' t kept panhandlers and loiterers away from his store , he said . He added that he is losing business and that some suppliers refuse to make deliveries because of conditions created by loiterers in the parking_lot . The security_guards hired last January seem only to have incensed locals . VanDenHende said that the store ' s front windows were broken recently after a guard allegedly caught a boy stealing . Some neighborhood residents say the youth was roughed_up . &quot; You would think the police would be able to do something about it , &quot; VanDenHende said , pointing_out the &quot; no loitering &quot; signs around the parking_lot . &quot; It hurts our business because people don ' t want to go_through ( the lot ) to get_to the store. &quot; The city ' s pending alcohol policy was first proposed by Day One , a community-based organization dedicated to fighting substance_abuse . Day One leaders say the whole city pays the price for alcohol-related violence . Day One used a grant from the Los Angeles County Health Services_Department to study alcohol and violence , joining Pasadena police to analyze crime figures for two-week stretches twice in 1990-91 , and twice again in 1993 . The study determined that , during the study weeks , alcohol was a factor_in half of all arrests , all homicide arrests , 60 % of rape cases and more_than half of all domestic assaults . Not counted was the time police spent defusing alcohol-involved situations that did not result in arrests . &quot; Many people ask why we targeted alcohol , &quot; said Angela Goldberg , who spearheaded Day One ' s initiative . &quot; Alcohol is the thread that runs_through the fabric of many social problems -- domestic violence , community breakdown and public safety . There are things we can do to reduce the problems . Alcohol policy is a real tool to reduce real problems in a real way. &quot; A soon-to-be-published study corroborates the Pasadena findings , reporting &quot; considerable evidence that alcohol consumption facilitates assaultive violence. &quot; The countywide study by Richard Scribner , a professor with the USC ' s Institute For Preventive Research , and David MacKinnon , an Arizona State University psychologist , went beyond the actual use of alcohol to establish a link between violence and the mere availability of alcohol . The study showed that a high density of alcohol outlets , while not the only factor , sets the table for violence in a community . The study predicted that adding a liquor_store to a typical city in Los Angeles County would result in 3.3 additional violent offenses each year . That sounds right to Pasadena police , who paid 400 calls last year to the intersection of Orange Grove and Summit Avenue , where two liquor_stores are situated across the street from each other . &quot; Would we have had 400 calls if the liquor_stores were not there ? Probably not , &quot; Lt . Jerry Shultze said . Given the strong association that the study makes between outlet density and violence , MacKinnon said that reducing the number of places where alcohol is available is sensible public policy . But Renee Wasserman , an Oakland-based lawyer who represents the California Beverage Retailers , disagrees . Wasserman said &quot; there is no empirical evidence &quot; that alcohol retailers cause more public safety problems than other businesses . Municipal attempts to regulate alcohol are misguided and unfair , Wasserman said . &quot; When you have arbitrary control over alcoholic_beverages , you end_up with more crime , &quot; Wasserman said , referring to the Prohibition_era in the United States . &quot; These ordinances are a smoke_screen , &quot; Wasserman said . &quot; They are a thinly veiled local alcoholic_beverage sales regulation . The cities want to . . . set_up their own tribunals to revoke business licenses without due process. &quot; Wasserman used that argument to win an injunction against a similar nuisance abatement ordinance in Oakland . But Oakland also attempted to fine outlets for overburdening police with calls . Wasserman said that practice made_it easy to prove that liquor outlets were being unfairly persecuted . Pasadena is looking instead to Los Angeles ' nuisance abatement ordinance for guidance . That ordinance recently survived a legal challenge by the Korean Grocers Assn . Los Angeles has successfully attached new conditions to stores rebuilding after the 1992 riots by focusing_on land-use issues rather than alcohol , according to city zoning Administrator John Perica . &quot; We cannot put_in a condition that has the word beer , wine , alcohol and liquor , &quot; Perica said . &quot; We cannot use those magic words. &quot; Thus , the city can ' t tell a problem store to stop selling alcohol after a certain hour -- that would be regulating alcohol sales -- but it can tell the entire store to close earlier . As a result , Perica said , license applicants and rebuilding store owners are volunteering their own conditions , such_as limiting sales of single beers and fortified wines . &quot; It has been successful , &quot; Perica said . &quot; We ' ve addressed about 125 problem outlets over the last year . People now know that if they don ' t run a responsible business they will hear from us. &quot; Perica is quick to point_out that the city isn ' t just badgering alcohol outlets . He said that one-third of abatement cases are against other businesses and that his department has even pursued a church parking_lot and a Little_League that were causing nuisances . Even as Pasadena ' s alcohol policy is being hammered_out in City_Hall , the entire process has spurred some neighborhoods to confront , and win concessions from , several problem outlets . For instance , the 7-Eleven parking_lot at Lake Avenue and Orange Grove has been a crime hot spot . During the periods in which Day One conducted its crime study , 7-Eleven ' s lot was the site of three murders , 10 armed_robberies , four assaults with deadly weapons , five burglaries and many lesser offenses . &quot; When you carry 15 brands of fortified wines and malt_liquors , you are asking_for a certain clientele , &quot; Goldberg , of Day One , said of the store . Paul Little , a leader in the nearby Bungalow Heaven Neighborhood Assn. , wrote a letter to a local newspaper urging Southland Corp. , the parent company for 7-Eleven , to do something . Goldberg advised Little and his neighbors to take their crusade to the source . After several meetings with neighborhood activists and city leaders , the mall owner and the proprietors of the 7-Eleven and Chief Auto Parts , which share the mall , agreed to split costs and hire a security_guard . Since the guard came_on late last year , violent crime in the lot has been reduced to one robbery report . Dev Nat , the owner of the 7-Eleven , said business is up 17 % because people feel more secure about shopping there . &quot; I get a lot of positive response from the community now , &quot; said Nat , who also stopped selling fortified wines and reduced her store ' s malt_liquor selection . &quot; There is a lot of community support and more people are shopping. &quot; A similar meeting of minds pushed Kazi Ahmed to rid gang members and drug dealers from his storefront grocery on Navarro Avenue and Howard Street . His efforts improved the good-natured store owner ' s community standing . Since the neighborhood intervened , Ahmed , who is expanding his store , has started emphasizing fresh_foods and groceries rather than alcohol . He also hired local contractors to help remodel the century-old structure , and he put local youths to work in the store . &quot; The thing in common is that we all want a good neighborhood in which to live and work in dignity , &quot; Ahmed said .</TEXT>
