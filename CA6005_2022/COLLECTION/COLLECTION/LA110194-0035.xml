   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : FAIRFAX AREA ; RABBI GETS 5 YEARS IN MONEY-LAUNDERING SCHEME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Los Angeles rabbi who agreed to launder drug money through a &quot; holy network &quot; of charities and nonprofit organizations was sentenced Monday to five years in federal prison . Abraham Low , 44 , rabbi at the ultra-Orthodox Mogen Abraham synagogue in the Fairfax area , was convicted April 7 of conspiring to commit money_laundering . U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi waived payment of any fines Low faced because he has no money to pay them , and he ordered the rabbi to surrender to authorities Nov . 21 . The judge denied a defense request to send Low to a halfway house so he would not be deprived of his religious requirements , which include specially prepared food and at least nine other men with whom to pray . Takasugi said the Bureau of Prisons , in a letter to the court , pledged to abide_by Low ' s religious requests , providing food supervised and certified by the Central Rabbinical Congress and sending him to a prison where there are other Jewish inmates . Low said he was not &quot; asking_for freedom , &quot; adding : &quot; I cannot and will not change my diet. &quot;</TEXT>
