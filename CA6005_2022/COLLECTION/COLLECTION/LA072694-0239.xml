   <HEADLINE> VALLEY INTERVIEW ; ONE OF THESE DAYS , SMOG IN L.A. COULD BE A THING OF THE PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Finally , some good news about a perennial Los Angeles problem . The smog is going_away . Not rapidly and not entirely , but there has been steady improvement in the air quality of the Los Angeles Basin , according to meteorologists from the South Coast Air Quality Management District . Indeed , they are confident that within two decades , smog will cease to be a serious health hazard in the region . Earlier this month , AQMD officials said that the alarming Stage 2 smog episodes , which used to be a regular part of San Fernando Valley summers , have been virtually eliminated . The less serious Stage 1 episodes , during which people are advised to avoid vigorous outdoor activity , are still with us but in ever decreasing numbers , they said . Mild-mannered Joe Cassmassi , an AQMD senior meteorologist , does not seem the kind of person who makes wildly optimistic predictions without solid foundation . But in an interview with Times staff writer David Colker , Cassmassi envisioned a smogless future . Question : If the smog situation is so improved , why do we still see all that brown yuck in the sky at this time_of_year ? Answer : We have come a long way , but you have to keep_in mind that weather_conditions in the Los Angeles Basin make the problem a difficult one . We have what we call photochemical smog , which is created by the emissions in the air that come from motor_vehicles and industrial emissions . In the presence of sunshine , there is a chain_reaction that turns these gaseous emissions into ozone . * Q : And that ' s the bad stuff . A : that ' s the smog , when ozone hovers near the surface . The weather is a primary factor . When you get a strong inversion that traps a lot of these emissions and no strong winds to blow them away , the sunshine can drive the smog formation process at a very rapid pace . Last year was a very good year for us because the El Nino conditions that gave us rains lasted a lot longer than anyone expected . That led to unsettled weather , giving us more cloudy days than normal , more wind and a weaker inversion . * Q : If weather is such an important factor , how do you know the smog situation is actually getting_better from year to year ? A : We can measure over a year the contribution weather has made and by factoring that out , we can look_at the overlying trends in air quality . In 1988 the peak concentration of ozone was . 35 parts per million . In 1989 it was . 34 , in 1990 it was . 33 and so on . Last year it was . 28 . So , what we are seeing is that the capacity to create severe smog episodes is being reduced with each year . Even if you don ' t factor_out the weather , you can see the progress . To give you a point_of_reference , if you go_back to 1980 , we had roughly 100 Stage 1 episode days in the Los Angeles Basin , which includes the Valley . By 1992 there we only 41 . And in 1993 we jumped down to 24 , with the assist in the weather . This year we expect on the order of 30 . * Q : How about Stage 2 alerts ? A : The last time we had a Stage 2 episode was in 1988 . It would be highly unusual for us to ever have one again . I don ' t expect it . * Q : Are we now to_the_point where other cities in the U . S . actually have more smog ? A : No , in terms of our report_card , we ' re still the smoggiest city in the country . In fact , the only other city that truly rivals L . A . is Mexico_City . It ' s in about the same league . * Q : We are still worse off than Tokyo , where traffic police have to take oxygen breaks ? A : that ' s a different kind of smog , actually . Instead of the photochemical smog that we have , they have what we used to call a London type of smog . It ' s a smokestack-type smog . * Q : Which type is worse ? A : It depends_on the contributing factors . Both types have fine particles that get_into your lungs . * Q : How are other cities doing at controlling emissions that cause smog ? A : There again you have to figure in the weather_conditions . If you take the greater Chicago area or the Boston-to-Washington corridor , these areas have almost comparable emissions as we do . But their weather_conditions are not nearly as restrictive . * Q : So , given the way our weather helps cook the smog , our conditions are getting_better because of a cutback in emissions in the air . A : Absolutely . We have a very significant program to try and clean_up the air and it has been working . We certainly have_the_best rate of improvement of any area . * Q : And you are confident that the situation will keep improving ? A : Yes , there are several laws and regulations already in place to keep things going_in the right direction . The state now has rules that say that by 1998 , 2 % of all_the new cars sold should be electric . The state has already set new standards for emissions from cars and in 1996 it will further emissions reductions through requiring reformulated fuels . That will make_for a significant cutback in pollution from what we had just a_few years ago . * Q : With all_the anti-pollution devices now on cars and the cleaner fuels now mandatory , have automobiles ceased to be the biggest contributors to pollution ? A : No , automobiles are still the primary contributors to air_pollution in this basin . * Q : Do you have specific goals for how clean the air will be in the near future ? A : We have set a timetable -- actually , the EPA ( Environmental Protection Agency ) has set a timetable -- giving specific dates by which they want us to achieve certain air quality standards . This breaks_down to four basic areas where we are in violation of federal standards : fine particulates , carbon_monoxide , nitrogen_dioxide and ozone . * Q : How close are you to meeting these standards ? A : We anticipate we will probably meet the nitrogen_dioxide standard within the next year or two . We have not been in violation of this standard for the last two years , but we have to wait a time frame of three years before applying for re-designation . We will achieve the carbon_monoxide standard by the year 2000 and the fine particulates by the year 2006 . We believe we ' ll have the ozone down to the standard by 2010 . * Q : At that point , is the pollution problem over ? Will we have clear skies and no more health hazards ? A : If we attain the standards , the health hazards will be significantly minimalized , although no one can say at this point they will be completely eliminated . As for the number of days you will be able to look outside your window in the San Fernando Valley and see the San Gabriel Mountains -- almost every day . The exceptions would be the days when you have a lot of coastal marine moisture , fog and marine haze , coming inland . * Q : That would be an astonishing improvement . A : There should be benchmarks along the way . By the year 2000 we might not be seeing any more Stage 1 episodes . The improvements will be a benefit not to just our area . The smog that originates_in L . A . has been clearly traced to the Grand_Canyon and ( other ) places in the Southwest . * Q : How are we doing so far this year ? A : As of today , we have had 15 Stage 1 episodes . that ' s a little higher than last year , as predicted .</TEXT>
