   <HEADLINE> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS / ORANGE COUNTY : FINDING AND LOSING A POSTWAR ' PARADISE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In her first book , &quot; Eva ' s War : A True Story of Survival , &quot; Eva Krutein of Irvine provided a compelling , first-hand account of surviving World_War_II . As a young married_woman , she and her 14-month-old daughter were forced to flee the Red Army as it advanced into her native Danzig , the former free_state that was annexed by Germany in 1939 and later became part of Poland . The 1989 book dramatically chronicled the hardships and horrors of war from a civilian perspective : Huddling with strangers in shelters during bombings , fellow civilians rummaging for food in garbage_cans , entire families &quot; living like rats in holes , &quot; beneath the rubble of their former homes , a female friend who was raped 30 times by Russian soldiers . Now Krutein , a retired music_teacher , is back with a sequel . &quot; Paradise Found , and Lost &quot; ( Amador Publishers ; $ 11 ) picks_up the Kruteins story after the family immigrated to Chile in 1951 . Krutein said in an interview that an unsettling political situation in Europe and the threat that the Soviet_Union would occupy western Europe prompted her and her family to leave Wilhelmshaven , Germany , where they had been living since the war ended . &quot; We didn ' t want to have to go_through the same thing twice : Running_away from the Russians at the last moment to become refugees as we did_in the first book and lose everything , &quot; she said . Krutein ' s husband , Manfred , who served as a lieutenant in the German navy , had opened a private shipyard on the North_Sea after the war . &quot; So , &quot; she said , &quot; we made a lot of money and could go_to America with our three children and take everything , including the piano. &quot; Their plans to immigrate to the U.S. , however , were quickly dashed . &quot; The immigration office said we needed a sponsor . We didn ' t know a single soul , therefore we went_to South_America . Chile and Venezuela were the only South_American_countries that accepted immigrants at that time. &quot; Once in Chile , Manfred found a job as a mining_engineer and Eva worked as an opera coach and gave piano and harpsichord concerts . To Krutein , Chile &quot; was a paradise . For me , it was the wonderful nature , the beauty of the country . that ' s why we went there , and we found it 100 times more beautiful than we thought . And they ' re very nice , warm , outgoing people. &quot; The Kruteins had to learn to speak Spanish and to deal with the culture shock of living in a country where , she said , &quot; Manana doesn ' t mean tomorrow . It means sometime or never . If you have an appointment , you get there on_time and either people show_up after an hour or not at all. &quot; Part of the book , which is written like a novel , also deals with machismo and the lack of women ' s rights in Chile . &quot; If women are beaten by their husbands , they accept it because there are no laws for the women. &quot; As the book ' s title indicates , however , Chile was a &quot; paradise found , and lost. &quot; By 1960 , American immigration laws had changed . Thanks to Sputnik , the Russian spacecraft , which propelled America into the space race , &quot; the U.S. needed more engineers and scientists and so Manfred could sponsor himself. &quot; Leaving Chile after nine years wasn ' t easy for Krutein , who helped_out in milk distribution center and a clinic for the poor . &quot; It was a heartbreak , &quot; she said . &quot; At first I didn ' t want to go because I loved Chile so much. &quot; In the U.S. , Manfred landed a job as a design engineer for a construction and mining_company in Palo Alto ; Eva returned to school , earning a master ' s degree in music . The family later moved to Pacific Palisades , San Diego and then Irvine in 1976 , and she also became a music instructor at UCLA and Pepperdine University . Krutein said her family &quot; left before the turmoil &quot; -- the election of socialist Salvador Allende as Chile ' s president , &quot; which created a chaos in the country and split the country in two . Then came the coup d ' etat by Augusto Pinochet &quot; in 1973 . But the book also chronicles the Kruteins return visits to Chile during the Pinochet dictatorship , their first in 1974 when they learned that many of their friends had been murdered , tortured or had disappeared . Their most recent return trip to Chile was in 1992 , with Pinochet long out of power and the country again returned to democracy . Krutein says she saw a Chile that was &quot; even more modern than California . For instance , although they have more earthquakes than we have , Santiago has an extended subway system , immaculately clean and punctual. &quot; She also noticed an improvement in women ' s rights : &quot; The women work now . Before they didn ' t because they were confined to their kitchens and to bed mainly. &quot; In general , she says , life in Chile is much better than when they left . &quot; Although ( Pinochet ) was a brutal dictator like Hitler and was guilty of the suffering and the deaths and disappearance of thousands of people , he helped build_up the country technically and economically. &quot; He was able &quot; to get loans from the U.S. because he was an enemy of the communists and therefore he got everything he wanted. &quot; &quot; Paradise Found , and Lost &quot; isn ' t the last we ' ll hear about the Krutein family . Krutein already has started writing a third book , one that will deal with &quot; the years from 1960 , including Manfred ' s involvement in the secret raising of a Russian nuclear submarine on the ocean_floor &quot; in the 1970s . Meanwhile , Krutein is telling the story of &quot; Paradise Found , and Lost &quot; during frequent talks in churches , clubs , libraries and colleges . She ' ll give a slide-illustrated talk at the University Club at UC Irvine Sept . 21 . For more information , call ( 714 ) 856-7737 .</TEXT>
