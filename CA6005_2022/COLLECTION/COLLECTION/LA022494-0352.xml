   <HEADLINE> THREAT OF VIOLENCE CIRCLES SARAJEVO DESPITE CALM ; BOSNIA : MORTAR BLAST SHATTERS ILLUSION OF PEACE . HEAVY_WEAPONS ARE STILL BEING FOUND NEAR CITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A mortar blast , a surge in machine-gun fire , a thwarted aid delivery and U.N. discovery of dozens more heavy_weapons in Serbian-held territory made clear Wednesday that the siege of Sarajevo has not really ended . Although the capital remains calm in comparison with the unbridled bombardment of the last 22 months , U.N. officials are finding it more difficult each day to pass_off the NATO ultimatum for ending the strangulation of this city as a resounding success . A mortar that detonated on the city ' s eastern outskirts overnight was too close to the confrontation line between Bosnian government and Serbian rebel forces to determine which side had fired it , said Lt . Col . Bill Aikman , spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) in Bosnia-Herzegovina . U.N. officials have been assuring the international community since NATO ' s Monday deadline for surrender or withdrawal of all heavy artillery from a 12-mile zone around Sarajevo that a sophisticated French radar system in place here could precisely locate any weapon firing on the capital in violation of a cease-fire . But Aikman said the explosion was too distant from the radar system located at the eastern extreme of the city , making_it impossible to determine the source and fix a target for retaliation . U.N. troops likewise claimed that they could not pinpoint the source of heavy artillery_fire on a convoy of Swedish peacekeepers near the northeastern city of Tuzla on Tuesday , in which five soldiers were injured . North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization flyovers were ordered , but no return fire was authorized by U.N. officials at mission headquarters in Zagreb , Croatia , despite a reported request from the besieged peacekeepers . Aikman said the source of the fire could not be determined . But the chief_of_staff of the Nordic battalion that was targeted in the attack , Lt . Col . Alf Gorsjo , told news_agency reporters in Tuzla that the fire came from Serbian-held territory . One of the most telling indications that NATO ' s Feb . 9 edict for liberating Sarajevo has evaporated amid U.N. objections to Western military intervention was the refusal by French peacekeepers to allow an aid official to cross the U.N.-patrolled siege line . The Sarajevo director of the International Rescue Committee , John Fawcett , had obtained the support of the U.N. commander in Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , for a first attempt to deliver humanitarian relief goods directly from central Sarajevo to the Serbian-held Grbavica neighborhood a_few hundred yards away . Throughout the siege , Serbian rebels had forced all relief supplies to run a gantlet of armed checkpoints that began at the far eastern extreme of the city . Rebel gunmen routinely delayed convoys , demanding authorizations from Serbian nationalist leaders in the rebel stronghold of Pale , and extorted parts of the cargoes as the price for passage . As part of the NATO ultimatum for ending the siege , U.N. troops have taken_over patrols of the front_lines between Serbian-held and government-held sectors . Rose has said these patrols should lead to free movement in and out of the capital . &quot; Gen . Rose said as far as he was concerned , the roads are open and we should start using them ASAP , &quot; Fawcett said , noting he had a written directive from the U.N. commander to that effect . Nevertheless , French troops standing watch on the Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity connecting central Sarajevo with Grbavica halted Fawcett , who was traveling with one other aid colleague and a truckload of boots . &quot; We tried and we got stopped by UNPROFOR . I guess the policy just hasn ' t filtered down to some levels , &quot; Fawcett said , adding that his agency will try again today to deliver its relief goods . U.N. troops may have barred the agency ' s passage on the assumption that Serbian rebels manning a checkpoint just beyond the bridge would turn the convoy back , as they continue to resist outside efforts to restore free movement in the capital they have trapped . U.N. officials here also appear to be backing_away from a March 7 date for opening Tuzla airport for relief supplies that was set by the U.N. chief of peacekeeping operations , Kofi Annan . More_than 750 # 000 people are in desperate need of aid in the Tuzla region , which is cut_off from road convoys by Serbian rebels to the north , west and east and has been blocked by Muslim-Croatian fighting along the only access route from the south . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has refused to agree to humanitarian relief flights into Tuzla , claiming the effort could funnel weapons to the mostly Muslim population there . A senior Bosnian Serb military official has threatened to fire on any foreign plane landing at Tuzla over Serbian objections . &quot; We ' re looking_at our resources and capabilities , &quot; Aikman said of the March 7 date for starting a Tuzla airlift . &quot; That is a proposal rather than a firm date. &quot; The U.N. spokesman also conceded that despite earlier assurances that the Serbs had complied with the NATO deadline for withdrawing or surrendering heavy_weapons , &quot; a surprising amount of stuff has been left in every imaginable location around the countryside. &quot; Aikman said 121 suspicious sites had been identified by NATO air and U.N. ground inspections since the deadline elapsed . Although most of those were determined to be vacant , at least 32 sites were found to have combat-ready weapons . U.N. troops are being assigned to each site .</TEXT>
