   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH_KOREA ; THE NUCLEAR CARD IS BACK IN PLAY ; KIM JONG IL ' S SURVIVAL DEPENDS_ON IT , SO HOPES WANE FOR WINNING COMPLIANCE WITH CARROTS INSTEAD OF STICKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even in death , Kim Il Sung has reshuffled the deck one final time in the high-stakes drama unfolding among Washington , Seoul and Pyongyang . The delay in the U.S.-North Korean negotiations in Geneva and the indefinite postponement of the first-ever North-South summit once again frustrate international efforts to stymie and reverse Pyongyang ' s worrisome nuclear activities , buying the embattled North_Korean regime additional time for weapons development . Kim would undoubtedly have enjoyed the irony . The initial impulse of the Clinton_Administration has been to remain as conciliatory as possible toward North_Korea . In public comments following Kim Il Sung ' s death , President Clinton and Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher have sought to keep avenues open_to the successor leadership in Pyongyang . The Administration clearly has no desire to upset the elaborately choreographed bilateral discussions in Geneva . South_Korean responses have been decidedly different . Although President Kim Young Sam voiced token disappointment that the scheduled summit is off , the South_Koreans are actually in no hurry to resume the dialogue . Seoul was originally prepared to accept inherently disadvantageous summit terms for one overriding reason -- a meeting with Kim Il Sung would have conferred legitimacy and stature on the South_Korean government in the eyes of its long-term enemies in Pyongyang . The passing of the legendary old leader removes all such incentives . Rather than bestow legitimacy on the south , a summit now would principally benefit Kim Jong Il . Although initial indications seem to point to a smooth succession , these signs are illusory . The South_Koreans are_well aware that Kim Jong Il is reclusive , untested , quite possibly unstable and very likely resented by his father ' s senior compatriots , including his politically powerful stepmother , Kim Song Ae . As a result , President Kim Young Sam has little to gain and much to lose in immediate talks with a leader whose hold_on power may be tenuous . That the younger Kim ' s hand is so weak helps explain why North_Korea took the initiative in postponing the summit . Moreover , the South_Koreans believe that Kim Jong Il is no conciliator . Since March , 1993 , when Pyongyang announced its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , North_Korean propaganda has repeatedly identified the younger Kim as the architect of this policy . Now he is likely to view determined pursuit of the nuclear_weapons program as integral to his efforts to consolidate his power . And he ' s probably right . The younger Kim ' s survival is likely to depend_on the skill with which he handles the next stages of the nuclear crisis . As leaders in Pyongyang mourn , the 8 # 000 fuel rods removed from the Yongbyon nuclear_reactor in late spring continue to cool . North_Korean spokesmen have already claimed that for reasons of safety ( supposed deterioration of the aluminum cladding in which the fuel rods are encased ) Pyongyang will need to remove some of the spent fuel from the cooling ponds by the end of August . This suggests that North_Korea may be preparing to violate Kim Il Sung ' s pledge to freeze the nuclear program in return for negotiations with the United States . If so , the Clinton_Administration will soon face a vexing decision -- whether to resume talks with North_Korea or seek complimance with sticks rather than carrots . Such a preemptive move by Pyongyang would be consistent with North_Korean behavior under Kim Il Sung . With his father gone from the scene , there is little to suggest that the younger Kim will be prepared to barter_away the one instrument of North_Korean power that could keep the outside world and his internal rivals at_bay .</TEXT>
