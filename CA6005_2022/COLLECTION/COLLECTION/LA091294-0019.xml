   <HEADLINE> DEATH PENALTY : ONLY FOR STRANGERS ? ; WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS KNOWN AS A PERSON , AS IN THE O.J. CASE , JURIES OFTEN CRINGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The decision announced last week by prosecutors not to seek the death_penalty against O.J. Simpson appears to spring as much from pragmatism as from any rarefied balancing of punishment against the alleged crime . Given that Simpson was an appealing celebrity with no felony record , prosecutors surely feared that seeking the death_penalty could jeopardize their ability to win a conviction for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . The decision , apparently weeks in the making , was obviously not an easy one for prosecutors , under pressure after recent losses in several headline cases and anxious to win a conviction in Simpson ' s approaching trial . The D.A. ' s decision to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if Simpson ( who has pleaded not_guilty ) is convicted speaks_to this nation ' s ambivalent views of how best to respond to crime and our notions of appropriate punishment for criminal offenders . The death_penalty has rested uneasily on the conscience of many Americans , as it has_on ours . And often , those closest to the gas_chamber are most uncomfortable with execution . Members of Congress , at some distance from a criminal courtroom , extended the death_penalty to more_than 50 federal crimes this year . A number of state legislators , with support from Gov . Pete Wilson , have for some years sought to extend the death_penalty to more state felonies , such_as drive-by_shootings . But prosecutors in all but the most heinous crimes , for example those involving the torture and murder of children or the cold-blooded slayings of total strangers , often remain reluctant to seek the death_penalty even where current law permits it , because juries often balk at conviction if they know the defendant may be executed . A mock jury on the Simpson case that prosecutors assembled last month in Phoenix , Ariz. , showed reluctance to convict Simpson , particularly if he faced the death_penalty . We are ambivalent as well about criminal defendants themselves . There is strong , even shrill , support for the imposition of swift , certain and increasingly harsh punishment for criminals in the abstract . In fact , the D.A. ' s decision in the Simpson case came the day after Gov . Wilson signed into law a bill imposing life terms for some first-time rapists ; the state ' s new three-strikes-and-you ' re-out law is in_effect . Yet when jurors come_to know individual defendants during a trial , they can balk at those stiff punishments . The Simpson case is already a symbol for what many regard_as society ' s failure to take seriously domestic violence against women . The prosecutor ' s decision not to seek the death_penalty may make this case a symbol , as well , of our conflicting feelings toward capital_punishment .</TEXT>
