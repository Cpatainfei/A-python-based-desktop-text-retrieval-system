   <HEADLINE> BACK TO THE BEACHWEAR ; CLOTHING : O.C. SURF-WEAR FIRMS ARE POISED TO BENEFIT FROM AN UNPRECEDENTED WAVE OF MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the ' 80s , surf wear practically sold itself to consumers who couldn ' t get enough of the Day-Glo shirts and shorts designed by Southern California companies . The industry wiped_out late in the decade , though , as neon colors fell from favor on the beach and off . Teens and young adults seeking a new look turned_to the dark , baggy urban styles inspired by rap and hip-hop groups , adopted by skateboarders and broadcast nationwide on MTV . Sun-drenched was out . Surf-wear makers were forced to regroup , and some , including longtime leader Ocean Pacific Sunwear Inc. in Tustin , eventually wound_up in bankruptcy court . National sales of surf apparel and accessories , worth about $ 1.5 billion annually in the late 1980s , sank to $ 500 million by 1991 , industry observers estimate . &quot; Beachwear , &quot; said Alan G . Millstein , editor of Fashion Network Report in New York , &quot; is no longer the fair-haired child of the department store. &quot; But the industry is positioned this year to catch a ride_on an unprecedented wave of marketing opportunities . In June , legendary surf filmmaker Bruce Brown and New Line Cinema will release &quot; Endless Summer II , &quot; a sequel to the 1964 mother of all surf flicks . There ' s also talk_of a sequel to &quot; Big Wednesday , &quot; the 1978 surf classic . And Disney is considering a movie about the late Dewey Weber , a legendary surfer whose remains were scattered on the waves at Redondo Beach in 1992 while hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects . &quot; We ' re going back and using surfing as vehicle , as a window to a time that wasn ' t so complex , &quot; said Weber ' s ex-wife , Carol . &quot; And in doing that , we found a great untapped reservoir of interest . Surfing is something that Hollywood thinks is very marketable. &quot; The fashion_industry thinks so , too . &quot; America is a sport-driven country , and there ' s still a romance with this sport , &quot; said Shaheen Sadeghi , a former executive of surf-wear maker Quiksilver in Costa Mesa . &quot; It ' s got an almost mystical attraction because it ' s not something most of us are exposed to. &quot; Surfing will also be getting big play this year on the small screen . Prime Ticket plans to televise 11 U.S. surf contests this year , including the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach in August -- the first world-class surf contest on the U.S. mainland in three years . And Coca-Cola has signed a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with the Assn . of Surfing Professionals for TV programming to be beamed to viewers in 23 countries . Sales of surf wear will surely benefit , said Lesa Ukman at IEG Consulting in Chicago . &quot; It ' s like beach volleyball , &quot; she said , which was unknown in most of the United States until the TV networks started covering it . As its popularity soared , so did demand for clothes like those worn by the pros . Being_on television , Ukman said , &quot; can do great things for lifestyle products. &quot; At the least , the new surf movies should refocus attention on Southern California as a playground rather than a recession-torn region pummeled by earthquakes , wildfires and floods . &quot; When Los Angeles had the riots and fires , the Southern California fashion_industry inherited the ashes , &quot; editor Millstein said . Not even the most optimistic beach-wear makers expect the surfer look_to be the rage again . But the manufacturers ' group notes that Americans will buy approximately 315 # 000 surfboards , 162 # 500 snowboards , 450 # 000 volleyballs and 467 # 500 wet suits this year -- and are expected to spend $ 405 million on clothes to wear while using that equipment . Quiksilver , which is licensed to produce &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; shirts , hats and accessories , is among companies that intend to ride the media wave . Standing to benefit are those &quot; with the most credible surf images -- Quik , Rusty , Billabong , Stussy -- . . . not the surf wanna-bes , &quot; said Robert B . McKnight Jr. , chairman of the company . &quot; This isn ' t going_to help launch fake labels like ' Surf Fetish , ' ' Maui &amp; Sons ' and that kind of crap. &quot; Apparel makers say what they ' re looking_for now is not a fad like Day-Glo but a profitable niche under the broad &quot; beach lifestyle &quot; umbrella . &quot; We ' re not interested in being a trend or fashion driven , &quot; said Mark Price , a former Gotcha Sportswear vice_president who is now an executive at Tavarua Island Surf Co . in Laguna Beach . &quot; We want to serve customers who don ' t change the way they dress. &quot; To do that , Tavarua is developing a line of casual clothing , including T-shirts , hats and sandals , with &quot; a South Pacific look , &quot; Price said . Tavarua -- the name of a South Pacific island known for spectacular surfing -- will be carried by 70 retailers across the nation . Ocean Pacific , which led the charge in the Day-Glo ' 80s , is trying to revive its apparel lines . The company last year sold its remaining assets through bankruptcy court to a Bay Area investment group that is now producing designs that incorporate the well-known OP label . Da Bull , a 2-year-old Long_Beach company , is focusing_on styles like those worn decades ago by long-board surfers . Similarly , Hang 10 in San Diego is building_on its line of &quot; retro &quot; clothing that borrows heavily from the ' 60s . Industry insiders maintain that surf wear will always play a role in the larger fashion scene . &quot; I think the story is that this industry is still alive , that after all these years it ' s still here , &quot; said Paul Holmes , a Hang 10 executive . Shop owners express some doubts about whether movies and TV alone can bolster sales . &quot; People buy clothing because it ' s cool . . . ( not because ) they know anything about surfing or care anything about surfing , &quot; said Ron Jones , who sells surf apparel through B ' Jammin ' , a Winter Park , Colo. , specialty_store chain . Surfers , too , question whether the wave of media interest means anything . &quot; It ' s just another tide change in surfing ' s hype , &quot; said Shawn Stussy , a surfer and creator of the highly successful Stussy Designs in Irvine . &quot; ' Endless Summer II ' and ' Big Wednesday II ' aren ' t soul movies like the original ' Endless Summer. ' These are Hollywood epics . They ' re apples and oranges . &quot; And there ' s no guarantee that they will sell clothes . &quot; It ' s just like the Super Bowl , &quot; said Don Meek , a Prime Ticket vice_president who is also a surfer . &quot; I can deliver to the advertiser the most highly rated show in history . But it ' s up_to the industry to put product on the shelf that people want to buy. &quot; Unlike major sports , which can drive clothing sales by licensing a popular team ' s logo , surfing hasn ' t had a single , dominant focus since the demise of Day-Glo . And , while the popularity of dark , slouchy street styles is waning , surf wear now faces a new challenge : the &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; look , which borrows from the outdoorsy , Pacific Northwest styles worn by the cast of the award-winning TV_show . &quot; In New York , Boston and Chicago you see these people dressed_up like they ' re going mountain climbing , &quot; Millstein said . &quot; But the only hill they ' ll ever see is the one in Central_Park where they walk their dogs. &quot; While male teen-agers may still crave Southern California labels like Mossimo , Quiksilver and Rusty , many older_men are instead choosing &quot; that outdoor , wholesome Eddie Bauer look , &quot; said Tom Campion , owner of the Zumiez specialty_store in Everett , Wash . &quot; And it ' s definitely something that had its origination here in the Northwest , not in Southern California. &quot; Tony Cherbak , a retail expert in the Costa Mesa office of accounting_firm Deloitte &amp; Touche , acknowledged that &quot; the Timberlands of the world are out there. &quot; But &quot; I ' m a firm believer that the beach lifestyle never goes_out of style , &quot; he said . &quot; Surf has dealt with hip-hop , it ' s dealing with grunge . The wholesome look is just one more look coming through. &quot; On Pro Tour , Surf ' s Up Inland ! Who says you have to be in Southern California to enjoy the region ' s much-envied lifestyle ? Since the late 1980s , the world ' s top professional beach volleyball_players have been digging , setting and spiking in sand-filled parking_lots in inland cities from Phoenix to Cleveland . Now , the world ' s top surfers are getting ready to move their sport inland , too . They ' ll be riding eight-foot waves generated by wave-making machines at water parks in Japan , South_Africa and the United States . The plan calls_for an initial round of inland surf contests at Walt Disney World in Florida , Palm Springs , Tokyo and Sun City , in the Bophuthatswana region of South_Africa . The inland tour eventually will be expanded to other water parks in the United States , Europe and Asia . The Australian-based Assn . of Surfing Professionals has identified 38 inland &quot; beach venues &quot; where it will stage &quot; rock ' n ' roll &quot; surfing events that feature live music and light shows along with top surfers . &quot; We can erect huge stages for the world ' s top rock_bands , &quot; said Bob Pritchard , a Santa Monica marketing consultant who is helping to arrange the inland events . &quot; With this combination of music , light shows and surfers , we can create a combination music-lifestyle event. &quot; Surfing U.S.A. Surfing industry observers predict that 1994 will see a comeback of the sport and a return of surf wear to the retail limelight .
