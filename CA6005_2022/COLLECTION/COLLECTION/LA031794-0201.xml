   <HEADLINE> LETTER SEEKS FUNDS FOR IMPRISONED KOON ; LAPD BEATING : THE PLEA , SEEMINGLY WRITTEN BY THE CONVICTED FORMER SERGEANT , PORTRAYS HIM AS A SCAPEGOAT . IT STRETCHES TRUTH , DESCRIBING RODNEY KING AS A PCP-CRAZED MURDER_SUSPECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The book publisher for Stacey C . Koon , the former Los Angeles police_sergeant serving prison time in the beating of Rodney G . King , has circulated a mass appeal for donations to help Koon ' s family and to help him appeal his federal civil_rights conviction as far as the U.S. Supreme Court . The letter , which purports to be written by Koon and bears his letterhead and signature , has been sent_out nationwide in recent months under the auspices of the &quot; Stacey Koon Defense Fund , &quot; operated out of a mail drop_in Glendale . It has generated much financial_support from police_officers and others for Koon , his wife and their five children , according to Koon ' s Washington-based book publisher , who organized the fund-raising_effort . In the letter , which the publisher said was largely written by Koon , King is lambasted as a PCP-crazed homicide suspect at the time of his arrest who never was struck in the head with police batons and &quot; only suffered minor injuries when finally forced to the ground. &quot; These are assertions that court evidence , and even one of Koon ' s former lawyers , say are unproven or untrue . Koon , serving 30 months in federal prison in Dublin , Calif. , could not be reached for comment . The four-page typeset letter also claims that Koon and former Officer Laurence M . Powell , also serving time in the King beating , &quot; are the political scapegoats of black radicals and self-serving liberal politicians who know that we are innocent. &quot; The letter quotes Koon as saying that when the whole story comes_out , people will be &quot; shocked , stunned and convinced that my officers and I were sold_out by weak politicians and a deceitful news media. &quot; Until then , he asks readers of the letter for as much as $ 1 # 000 each so he and Powell can appeal their cases and get_out of prison before they are killed by police-hating inmates . &quot; That will take dollars , &quot; the letter says , &quot; lots of them. &quot; The publisher of Koon ' s book , &quot; Presumed Guilty , The Tragedy of the Rodney King Affair , &quot; said this week that he came_up with the fund-raising idea . Alfred S . Regnery , president of Regnery Publishing Inc. , said most of the money raised will go_to Koon ' s family and to pay his legal bills . But he acknowledged that included in the letter is a sales pitch asking readers to make a donation of $ 30 or more to get a copy of Koon ' s book . Copies of the book are being given to the defense fund at &quot; slightly over cost , &quot; he said . * The fund-raising appeal is aimed at the general public as well as police_officers and has generated thousands of responses and donations , Regnery said . He would not say how much money has been raised . Because the defense fund is not a political entity or charitable group , it does not have to report to the state or federal_governments how much money it raises , and how much of that it passes along to its intended benefactor , according to the state_attorney general ' s office . Koon and three other white officers beat King , who is black , after he led them on an eight-mile chase and refused to pull over his car on March 3 , 1991 . All four were acquitted of state charges , and the verdicts ignited three days of rioting in Los Angeles . Koon and Powell were later convicted in U.S. District Court of violating King ' s civil_rights . Los Angeles police officials declined to comment on the letter , which several people involved in the case say contains inaccuracies or unproven facts . &quot; You see defendants do this type of fund raising , but it is problematic when it becomes deceptive and misleading , &quot; said Laurie Levenson , a Loyola Law_School professor who monitored the federal trial last year . There are laws that prohibit the use of the mail to obtain money through misleading communications , but Levenson said she doubted Koon would be cited . As for the claim in the letter that King was high on PCP , blood_tests did not find evidence that he had used the drug before he was subdued by Koon and his fellow officers . The letter also suggests that King was treated roughly by officers at the scene because he was &quot; the prime suspect in a homicide at the time of his arrest &quot; -- another contention prosecutors and defense_lawyers agree is untrue . Asked how such a claim made its way into the letter , Regnery said : &quot; I can ' t remember where that came from. &quot; And despite the letter ' s assertions that King was injured only by falling to the ground , doctors who testified for the prosecution at Koon ' s federal trial said King ' s face was fractured in 15 places , probably from blows landed by a police baton or similar weapon . Doctors who testified for the defense disputed that account , saying that King ' s injuries were in fact the result of one or more face-first falls to the pavement . Koon ' s lawyer in the state case , Darryl Mounger , said he found it hard to believe that the former sergeant would include such inaccuracies and contested facts in a public appeal for money . &quot; It certainly doesn ' t sound like something Stacey would do , &quot; Mounger said . &quot; I would not think Stacey Koon would acquiesce to someone else writing that letter , certainly because some things in there are not true. &quot; Regnery , however , maintains that the fund-raising_drive is a sincere effort to help Koon . He said he and Koon became friends when Koon spent a week at his house during a promotional tour for the book . Koon ' s wife , Mary , prefers not to comment about her family ' s plight , Regnery said . But in the letter , Koon says his wife has &quot; suffered horribly &quot; through the ordeal , as have his five children . Some of Koon ' s legal bills already have been paid -- the Los Angeles police union paid at least $ 150 # 000 for his lawyers and court costs in the two trials . But Regnery and others said Koon ' s bills probably will climb as his appeal proceeds , and that his family ' s expenses are mounting while he is in prison . The U.S._government also has appealed Koon ' s sentencing . Federal prosecutors say Koon and Powell received lenient sentences because U.S. District Judge John G . Davies erred in calculating what would be appropriate under federal law . Suspended without pay in 1991 , Koon was dismissed from the department several weeks ago after an administrative_hearing . His lawyers have contended he was treated unfairly by the city , which did not pay his legal bills as it has in some_other cases , and for suspending him without pay before resolution of the case .</TEXT>
