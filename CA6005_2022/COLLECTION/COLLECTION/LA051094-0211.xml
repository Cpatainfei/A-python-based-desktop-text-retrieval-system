   <HEADLINE> SUSPECTED SLIDE IN LAGUNA BEACH FEARED LARGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The size of a suspected ancient landslide beneath a neighborhood already hard hit by fire and an earlier slide may be larger than previously believed , according to geologists . In a proposal made public Monday , Geofirm -- a geotechnical consulting_company -- recommended an extensive study of the geology underlying about 65 lots in the Temple Hills area . Initial reports had indicated that no more_than three streets might be affected , but geologists now say the study area should include portions of eight streets . The area -- including parts of Bayview Place , Buena Vista Way , Temple Hills Drive , Canyon View Drive , Wendt Terrace , Griffith Way , Glomstad Lane and Wilcox Drive -- is the second fire-damaged neighborhood here to be shaken by reports of suspected ancient landslides . The findings , if correct , threaten to delay the efforts of victims of the devastating Oct . 27 fire to rebuild their homes and raise questions about whether the owners of surviving houses may be required to perform costly stabilization . In March , the city learned that an ancient landslide could lie under 50 lots in the Mystic Hills neighborhood and contracted with Geofirm to study the area . That report , due_to be delivered to city officials on Wednesday , confirms that a slide exists there but also shows that it affects fewer than 20 lots , about half the size of the original study area , according to a source close to the investigation . Last month , after reports from geologists and one property_owner of the possibility of similar problems under Buena Vista Way and two nearby streets in the Temple Hills area , city officials asked Geofirm to prepare a proposal to examine that area as well . The two-part study , which would cost the city $ 38 # 000 , is scheduled to be considered at tonight ' s City_Council meeting . The contract calls_for a study that would take an estimated six to eight weeks and involve drilling test borings an average of 80 feet deep . The suspected slide , evidence of which was discovered by geologists contracted by private homeowners to prepare geological studies of their property in the wake of the fire , is believed to lie 65 to 76 feet below the surface . Of the affected lots , 15 or 16 were damaged or destroyed by the fire , with the remainder involving existing homes and a_few vacant_lots , said Terry Brandt , municipal services director . Officials with Geofirm declined to comment Monday either on the Temple Hills proposal or the Mystic Hills report , now nearly completed . Laguna Beach Councilman Wayne L . Peterson said Monday he thinks the city should move rapidly to study the second area . &quot; It ' s essentially taking the same action we took_in Mystic Hills , &quot; he said . &quot; I think that ' s what we need to do and do_it as quickly as we can . &quot; We ' ve always known there were problems ( on city hillsides ) , we just didn ' t know to what degree. &quot; On Monday , life continued as usual for some residents in the affected section of Temple Hills . Charlotte Moore , a Temple Hills Drive resident whose home suffered relatively minor damage in the fire , appeared unfazed by the latest dose of bad news . &quot; We ' ve never had any slide problems and we ' ve been here 22 years , so we ' re not really worried about it , &quot; she said . On nearby Buena Vista Way , where a small landslide in March , 1993 , caused two homes to slide toward each other , another resident paused while walking his dog to discuss the report that his property may sit atop an ancient landslide . The man , who asked not to be identified , said he was not shocked by the latest development . &quot; We ' ve got this house up here , &quot; he said , gesturing toward a condemned , still-sagging house up the street . &quot; We ' ve had fires , we ' ve had floods , we ' ve had earthquakes . So why should we be shocked ? &quot; Other area homeowners , who received maps and notices from the city over the weekend that their properties lay inside the study area , appeared equally sanguine Monday . Carol Olson , whose Canyon View Drive_home is still under repair after it was damaged in last year ' s landslide , noted that geologists told city officials then that the slippage might have occurred because water leaking from a broken pipe had reactivated an ancient landslide . The responsibility for that slide , which forced the condemnation of two other houses , is still the subject of litigation . Of the latest disclosure , Olson said she &quot; pretty much took it in stride. &quot; After all , she said , &quot; most of Laguna seems to have ancient landslides under it. &quot; Several streets down the_hill , Barbara Morrissey said she was confident the old slide would not affect her Wendt Terrace property , which came_through the fire unscathed . &quot; It only affects the folks who are trying to rebuild , &quot; Morrissey said . &quot; They ' re not going_to make the people whose houses are OK tear them down and rebuild them again . It hasn ' t concerned me in any way. &quot; With regard_to the Mystic Hills problem , city staff previously suggested that the city consider creating a special tax_assessment district to pay_for any required stabilization of the hillsides . In the meantime , Laguna ' s post-fire rebuilding effort is inching forward . As of Friday , 153 applications had been submitted to the city for plan checks . Only five permits have been issued . Without the necessary geological clearance , fire victims whose lots are in the potential problem areas cannot obtain building_permits from the city . However , city officials say that displaced residents can still have their architectural_plans prepared and get preliminary approvals from the city . Search for Slide Area If the Laguna Beach City_Council approves , geologists will extract earth samples to determine if an ancient landslide exists under the Temple Hills neighborhood . The study would take about six to eight weeks and involve about 65 lots . Earlier this year a different slide area was identified in the Mystic Hills neighborhood .
