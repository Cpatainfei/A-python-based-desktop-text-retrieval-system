   <HEADLINE> HOLLAND ' S GARDEN OF DELIGHTS ; DESTINATION : NETHERLANDS ; KEUKENHOF CELEBRATES 400 YEARS OF TULIPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a way , I was reminded of Oz . As we entered Holland ' s Keukenhof gardens last spring , instead of poppies to either side of our path , there were tulips , big red ones , the size of candy_apples . And like Dorothy , the Lion , the Scarecrow and the Tin Man , we were drawn forward . The enchantment grew . Along one pond ' s edge , tulips and daffodils presented double images -- as white swans sliced_through the rippling reflections in the water ' s surface . Spring flowers of every sort caught the eye -- fragile anemones spreading little carpets along the edges of the beds , fritillaria blossoms hanging bell-like from tall stalks , cherry_trees dipping pink-laden branches to the ground . One breathtaking vista ran arrow-straight back through the woods in an avenue of tiny , deep-blue grape_hyacinths bordered by yellow daffodils and more red tulips . People who love spring can do no better than visit Keukenhof , the world ' s largest flower_garden -- and just possibly the world ' s most beautiful one as well . Over 6 million bulbs -- tulips , daffodils , hyacinths , amaryllises -- bloom here each year on some 70 exquisitely landscaped acres . And the effect is , well . . . intoxicating . I never grow tired_of Keukenhof . I have been there three times over the years , and would go again now , if I could . It is an elixir . There couldn ' t possibly be a place where flowers delight more . And probably no more so than in 1994 , which marks the 400th season that tulips have bloomed in the_Netherlands . The anniversary is to be celebrated in grand style ( see accompanying story on L13 ) , and amid much public relations hoopla as an opportunity to lure visitors and their pocketbooks . My wife and I paid our most recent visit last spring in mid-April . We were staying in an Amsterdam hotel and could have taken a guided tour of the park , driven there in a tourist bus . But we preferred to be_on our own , so that we could wander freely and , later , explore some of the surrounding countryside . Since Keukenhof lies only a half hour or so by car southwest of Amsterdam ' s Schiphol Airport , we decided to take a train from the city ' s main railroad_station to the arrivals terminal and there rent an automobile for the day . This would save us from having to drive through city traffic and to skirt the omnipresent bicyclists . We started early , eager to arrive_at Keukenhof as close as possible to the 8 o ' clock opening . We knew from experience that Dutch spring mornings are often a whole_lot brighter than the afternoons , and that there is nothing like crisp sunshine to bring_out the flowers ' colors . Driving was easy . We found the roads on the way well marked , with signs pointing_the_way to Lisse , the town nearest to Keukenhof . Even if we had lost the way , we would not have been at_a_loss for directions : Almost every Netherlander speaks English to one degree or other . * For so beautiful a place , Keukenhof has quite an ordinary name . It means &quot; kitchen_garden , &quot; dating_from the time when this was a vegetable_patch and hunting park for a noble family . Entering the garden , we were instantly enveloped in the perfume of thousands of hyacinths . And if this weren ' t enough of a special welcome , we were serenaded by birds chirping in the newly leafed trees . H.N.T. Koster , the landscape_architect who designs the flower beds , uses color like an oil_painter , setting_up strong contrasts , or subtly blending pinks , whites and pale blues . His intent is never to overwhelm the eye , but rather to lead it on . With little rises , ponds , streams and canals to separate areas , and the flowers winding brightly around these , he has made this an intimate place despite its large size . And such is Keukenhof ' s magic that though it can become very crowded ( almost a_million visit during the April-May season when it is open_to the public ) , people seem never to get_in the way . Perhaps that is because almost everyone walks slowly , with head bowed , mesmerized by the sight of flowers , flowers , flowers . One of the excitements of Keukenhof is its dazzling variety . Tulips appear not only in their ordinary globe-like form in a range of solid colors , but also with striped or variegated petals , some of the edges shirred , some ruffled , some fringed . Several seem more like peonies than tulips , and a_few are even sweetly scented . Many stand only inches tall ; others rise proudly on sturdy , three-foot stems . The 100 or so Dutch bulb growers and exporters who participate in the garden are eager to display their finest here . The growers are forever experimenting with crosses , seeking new strains . In a way , it is as though tulipmania , the obsession that seized the Dutch in the 17th Century , never quite abated . Then people squandered fortunes investing in bulbs that promised different colors and markings . The desire for rarity ran so high that individual bulbs could command extravagant barter prices ; a single bulb was said to have been exchanged for a silver goblet , a bed , a fine suit_of_clothes , 12 sheep , eight pigs , four oxen and a_thousand pounds of cheese . When tulipmania had reached its peak in 1637 , the market -- as so often happens when unreality overtakes such ventures -- went bust . Sanity may rule now , but the quest_for the exotic continues . It is a matter of good business : The Dutch command the international bulb market , and they see the advantage in delivering to gardeners everywhere the showiest , the prettiest , the latest . Indeed , 95 % of the bulbs planted in the world come from the_Netherlands . Nowadays much attention is being devoted to developing bulbs that will withstand diseases and flourish in warm climates . * As my wife and I knew from past experience , there is no one route to follow in Keukenhof . We found more_than once that we had doubled_back on ourselves , and didn ' t mind . In fact , on a_couple_of occasions we deliberately returned to spots for another view of them . The goal is to amble , to relax , to enjoy , to drink it in . Yet for seemingly so easy a place , nothing is left to chance . Thirty gardeners tend the flowers and lawns , part of a staff of 350 that includes costumed hostesses to answer visitors ' questions . So that the garden is continually in bloom during the two months it is open , the flowering time of each variety is taken_into_account , and the bulbs are planted accordingly . While some are fading , others are just coming_into full glory . From year to year the beds themselves are shifted , another means of cutting_down on the risk of soil infection , and keeping the garden continually fresh . Weather can be a problem in Holland . What is spring without rain ? But even here , only a_few miles from the sea and its storms , the Dutch have taken_care of everything . They have built a gigantic greenhouse at the center of the park , and it encloses another garden that presents , just like the beds outside , a carefully timed , ever-changing flower show . Scattered throughout the garden are exhibition_areas and cafes , and there is a large restaurant as well . Feet can grow tired on Keukenhof ' s 10 miles of paths , and we retreated to the restaurant for a cup of strong Dutch koffie and Dutch apple cake , made with tart apples and served under a_couple_of clouds of whipped cream . Visitors who are stirred by the displays can buy cut flowers or , better yet , order bulbs to plant . Keukenhof lies_in the heart of the_Netherlands bollenstreek , the 49 # 000-acre bulb district between Leiden and Haarlem . Stretching_out from the garden ' s boundaries in all directions are the fields of some of the many growers . This is where we headed after our morning in the park . We drove past row upon row of tulips , hyacinths and daffodils running straight to the horizon in precise rows that narrowed and converged in the distance , drenching the landscape in_color . And more_than once we saw a bulb grower wandering up and down his rows , wooden shoes on his feet , eyes cast_down , looking_for the genetic sport , the one unique flower that might be the basis for a whole new_line ( and make him rich ) . This spring , when I go_out to our garden to admire the tulips we bought_at Keukenhof ( bulbs intended for the U.S. are specially inspected and approved for shipment ) , I will think gladly of him and all those other Dutch farmers who down through the years have given so_much pleasure to the world .

Tulips and a Smile Tulips have bloomed in the_Netherlands for 400 years , but the flower the world associates with Holland isn ' t Dutch at all . It came_to Holland via Turkey , where it had become the favorite of the sultans . And the Turks had gotten_it , in turn , from the steppes of western and central Asia , its home_in the wild . Thanks to their love for its enameled beauty , the Turks bred the little flower into something to bedazzle the eye . Sufficiently impressed , the Austrian ambassador to Turkey had several bulbs sent to the Dutch botanist Carolus Clusius , who in the autumn of 1593 planted them as a novelty in the garden of the Hortus Botanicus ( Botanical Garden ) in Leiden . The Dutch took_to the new flower with a vengeance ; in time even the Turks were importing breath-taking varieties that the Dutch had created through cross-pollination . During the 17th Century the craze for tulips in Holland got_out of hand , with furious speculation going_on over bulbs that promised breakthrough colors and patterns . Three bulbs of one strikingly variegated type , Semper Augustus , sold for three times the price of a house on one of Amsterdam ' s canals just before the 1637 collapse of the market . Today , there are more_than 2 # 700 tulip varieties , identified by name and color and described in the finest detail in a 300-page official registry . Many bear the names of famous people -- and then there are some that have made their namesakes famous , such_as Madame Lefebre , a particularly popular bloom the world over . In celebration of their 400-year-old love_affair with the tulip , the Dutch are putting_on many special exhibitions and garden shows from March through May this year . Here are a_few of note : Tulipmania , Inside and Out , Frans Hals Museum , De Hallen , Haarlem ; local telephone 23-319-180 . Worth a visit at any time_of_year for its fine collection of paintings , this museum increases its drawing power between March 24 and May 23 with an exhibition of objects , paintings and prints associated with the 17th-Century craze , and some of the rare tulips that were the cause of it . 400 Years of Tulips : A Source of Inspiration , Museum for the Bulb-Growing District , Lisse ; tel . 25-211-7900 . From mid-March until the middle of June , the museum will hold an exhibition showing how Dutch artists -- painters , weavers and potters -- have been inspired by the tulip . Hortus Botanicus , Leiden ; tel . 71-275-144 . During April and May , this botanical_garden -- the very one in which Clusius planted the first tulips in 1593 -- will have a living tulip display featuring the tulip ' s family_tree . Hortus Bulborum , Limmen ; tel . 22-051-529 . This outdoor museum of living bulbs will have in bloom -- between April 10 and May 15 -- several tulip varieties dating_back hundreds of years . Hortus Haren , Haren ; tel . 50-632-010 . From March 26 until May 22 , three million tulips will bloom in the Tulpenhof garden ; a special Turkish garden will trace the tulip ' s history . Keukenhof , Lisse ; tel . 25-211-9034 . In addition to its spectacular sea of flowers , Keukenhof will present a special exhibition of paintings by European masters in which tulips are the focus . The Corso : Each year , the famous colorful parade wends its way from Haarlem to Noordwijk through the Bulb District with flower-decorated floats . This spring , the parade is scheduled for April 23 , with special emphasis on the tulip ' s 400th anniversary in Holland . The floats can be viewed the day before the parade at Hobaho Hall , Lisse .</TEXT>
