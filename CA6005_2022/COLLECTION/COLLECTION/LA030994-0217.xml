   <HEADLINE> GERMAN JOBLESS RATE HITS 10.5 % ; DAMAGE TO KOHL LIKELY ; EUROPE : PUBLIC SAYS EMPLOYMENT IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE RUN-UP TO FALL ELECTIONS . MANY ECONOMISTS DEPLORE HIGH LABOR COSTS , LOW PRODUCTIVITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German unemployment rose to a postwar record of 4.04 million in February , climbing toward the jobless levels that helped bring Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler to power in 1933 . The Federal Labor Office announcement Tuesday of a 10.5 % jobless rate bodes poorly for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his center-right Christian Democratic Union in this year of 19 state and federal elections . The country will vote for a new Parliament and chancellor in October . Germans have identified unemployment as the top election issue in recent polls that also show Kohl fighting for political survival . His party , which rules_in a coalition with the Free Democratic Party , is losing ground to the left-of-center Social Democratic Party . Kohl spokesman Dieter Vogel downplayed the figures as &quot; no surprise &quot; after unemployment topped 4 million in January . Finance_Minister Theo Waigel added that the recession-plagued economy shows signs of recovery . &quot; All the basic indicators in Germany are pointing upward . The economic situation will generally improve in 1994 , despite high unemployment , &quot; Waigel said . Some economists agree , although the Economics Ministry released data Tuesday showing that western Germany ' s economy actually shrank in the last_quarter of 1993 . Previously , the government had said it was flat . The ministry said the region ' s gross_domestic_product fell 0.5 % from the previous quarter and 0.9 % from a year earlier . Kurt Volger-Ludwig , head of labor and social politics at the IFO Institute for Economic Research in Munich , noted that joblessness is always higher in winter and said unemployment is not likely to worsen in 1994 . But many economists emphasize that Germany ' s unemployment problem is structural , and they warn that more companies will send more jobs abroad if labor costs do not come_down and industry does not become more competitive . German wages have been rising faster than those of other major industrial nations and nearly twice as fast as Germany ' s own industrial output . From 1985 through October , 1993 , unionized workers ' real hourly wages grew 23 % , compared to a 12 % growth in industrial output , according to the Federal Statistics Office . By contrast , real wages in the United States declined 8.5 % in the same period . German industry has been resisting unions ' wage demands in the last year , setting_off a wave of warning strikes and a vote to strike by IG Metall , the union of engineering workers , in Lower_Saxony last week . The strike -- which would have been the first major walkout in western German industry in 10 years -- was averted at the last minute when the union effectively agreed to a pay freeze for 3.6 million engineering workers . IG Metall leader Klaus Zwickel said the union had traded &quot; job security against money. &quot; The agreement was seen as a signal to the country ' s 3.5 million public sector workers , who have launched a series of warning strikes for wage negotiations scheduled to begin today . Unionized bank employees , printers and construction workers are also seeking raises . The figures released Tuesday showed that unemployment rose in western Germany to 8.9 % of the work_force in February from 8.8 % in January . In eastern Germany , the rate was 17.1 % compared to 17 % in January . Eastern German voters naturally express the most concern about unemployment in election polls . And eastern Germany , which Kohl helped to reunite with the west , could be the decisive_factor in ousting the western chancellor after 12 years in office .</TEXT>
