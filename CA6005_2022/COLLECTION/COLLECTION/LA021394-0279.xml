   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA COMBATANTS STOP SURRENDERING BIG GUNS TO U.N. ; BALKANS : EFFECT ON SARAJEVO CEASE-FIRE IS UNCLEAR . MEANWHILE , PEACE TALKS IN GENEVA BREAK UP WITH NO PROGRESS_REPORTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Government and Bosnian Serb fighters who had just begun surrendering their big guns to the United Nations stopped Saturday , but whether that was only a hitch in the 2-day-old truce or a more dangerous sign remained to be seen . The day was_full of ominous developments . * Despite U.S. and Russian pressure on the warring sides , peace talks in Geneva broke_up with no progress_reported , raising further doubts about the viability of the Sarajevo cease-fire . * The U.S. State_Department ordered the families of American diplomats and government employees to leave Yugoslavia immediately , embassy officials in Belgrade said . The decision was precipitated by NATO ' s ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy_weapons from Sarajevo by midnight Feb . 20 or face air strikes . Many in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia support the Bosnian Serbs , and the U.S._government apparently is worried about a backlash against Americans if the air strikes are carried_out . * Bosnian Serb TV_showed film Saturday night of camouflage-clad fighters aiming shoulder-held ground-to-air missiles at imaginary NATO planes . Displays of bluffing and brinkmanship have characterized war and peace in the Balkans , and it was unclear whether Saturday ' s developments meant that the latest of numerous cease-fires was in danger of collapse . The Serbs , while chafing at the NATO ultimatum , agreed as part of Wednesday ' s cease-fire to pull_back their heavy_weapons and put them under U.N. supervision . The order also applied to Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government . After handing_over several mortars and other big guns at Sarajevo-area barracks Friday , neither side turned_in any weapons on Saturday , said Maj . Jose Labandeira , a U.N. spokesman . The Bosnian army turned_over five guns Friday but decided to keep the rest for now , saying the Serbs had 10 times as_many but had turned_in only 13 . &quot; They have many_more weapons than we do , so they must hand in many_more , &quot; said Gen . Jovan Divjak , the deputy Bosnian army commander . Divjak charged that the Serbs had withdrawn their big guns from the 12-mile zone around Sarajevo but were hiding some or taking them to other battle fronts . Sarajevo was unusually peaceful , although a tank shell that landed near downtown Saturday afternoon injured two people . French peacekeepers have camped_out at six flash_points of the Sarajevo fighting since Thursday , and Friday night was the quietest in months . The French soldiers began working to restore electricity to the city , a repair job that will take at least 10 days if peace holds . &quot; Once all_the lights are_on , life will be transformed , &quot; said Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the new U.N. commander in Bosnia . In the meantime , Sarajevans who wanted to watch the opening of the Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway , had to hook_up portable TVs to car_batteries or watch at the few places that had electricity . The 1984 Winter Games were held_in Sarajevo . &quot; I feel terrible when I remember all_the beauty during the Sarajevo Olympic Games , &quot; said Ismet Kaminlija , an army captain who watched the ceremony from a hospital_bed , where he was recovering from a machine-gun wound . Rose ' s peacekeepers were thin on the ground -- about 30 at each cease-fire line -- but 150 Malaysian reinforcements arrived in Sarajevo , while others set_up at Bosnian Serb positions in the mountains . On Mt . Trebevic , southeast of the capital , French Lt . Lionel Paillot and his infantrymen moved_into a burned-out restaurant . Milenko Blagojevic , a Bosnian Serb machine-gunner nearby , said he didn ' t think NATO would bomb his position . If it does , he said , &quot; The people here will kill those French with axes and knives. &quot; But Rose said the U.N. troops were there to stay . &quot; The troops who have been put_on the ground between the warring elements will not go_back , &quot; he said . If fired on , &quot; they will fire back . But that won ' t happen because people want peace. &quot; Saturday marked the one-week anniversary of the mortar shell explosion at Markale market that killed 68 people , injured 142 and led NATO to issue its ultimatum . In northwestern Bosnia , Serbs and Bosnian army troops battled on the Grabez plateau near Bihac , according to U.N. spokesman Lt . Col . Bill Aikman . Bosnian government radio said that Bosnian Serb fighters fired on mosques in the towns of Cazin , Bihac and Ostrozac and that a number of civilians were killed . The report could not be confirmed . Croats fired 69 shells into the Muslim sector of Mostar , in the south , Friday night , Aikman said .</TEXT>
