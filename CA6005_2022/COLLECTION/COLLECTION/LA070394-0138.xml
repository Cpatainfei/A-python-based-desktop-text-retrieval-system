   <TEXT> I take great exception to your article ( &quot; Soccer , Schmoccer , &quot; June 26 ) in which your reporter pokes_fun at Americans who find soccer boring . What ' s so great about a bunch of men in short pants running_up and down a field kicking a ball ? Give me American sports any day . Is there anything more exciting than watching a bowling match , with announcers who whisper and spectators whose exuberance reaches a murmur ? Does your reporter actually think that the sound of 70 # 000 soccer fans screaming is more exciting than hearing 10 bowling pins falling_over ? And what sport is more thrilling than golf ? I would rather spend two hours watching someone in knickers chase a tiny ball around a park than waste a minute watching the World Cup . As for suspense , my heart almost stops when I see a golfer getting ready to putt , especially when he crouches to count the blades of grass between his ball and the hole . I get goose bumps just thinking_about it . And , of course , nothing can match the excitement of the greatest game ever devised by the human mind : baseball . Where else can one experience the thrill of watching eight of nine offensive players sitting in a dugout ? Or the incredible suspense of pitcher , catcher and manager having a conference on the mound ? Indeed , the most breathtaking event in all_of sports is a pitchers ' duel because it gives fans the chance to spend three hours watching a center_fielder scratch himself . Baseball is so exciting it has been adopted by the Japanese , Cubans and little boys in Taiwan . Can soccer match that ? Soccer is also un-American because it is a threat to the free-enterprise system . With no timeouts , concessionaires will be forced_out of business . If soccer becomes a major sport in the United States it will signal the return of communism . F . G . WOOD Bakersfield * Congratulations on your Page 1 photo of June 23 , showing the U.S. soccer team ' s victory against Colombia , rather than Houston winning the NBA championship . It made this country seem a member of the world for once , rather than a special case . How refreshing ! DAVID FEIN La Jolla</TEXT>
