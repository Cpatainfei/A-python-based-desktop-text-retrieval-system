   <HEADLINE> HANDS THAT ROCK THE CRADLE ; ALL AMERICANS MUST REACH_OUT TO HELP THE NATION ' S YOUNGEST POOR CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America treats many of its youngest children shamefully . Trapped in unstimulating environments that stunt intellectual growth or in violent environments that harm emotional development , they have only a limited chance of maturing into healthy , responsible and productive adults . Blame the decline of our most vulnerable citizens on broken families , runaway poverty , inadequate health_care and poor child_care . But these need not be permanent conditions . They are reversible , and indeed must be reversed . Such are the findings of a Carnegie Corp . report , &quot; Starting Points : Meeting the Needs of Our Youngest Children. &quot; The three-year study quantifies much of what America knew : More_than 25 % of babies are born to unmarried_women ; 25 % of pregnant women get little or no prenatal care ; babies account_for one out of three victims of child_abuse , and infants are the fastest-growing category of children entering foster care . These depressing statistics must challenge every American . Government cannot raise children , but it can do something . Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) would provide an additional $ 1 billion for five proven , successful programs without inflating federal_deficits . Boxer ' s amendment to the budget resolution -- an amendment that recently passed the Senate by a huge margin -- would provide $ 120 million for Head_Start to make room for 24 # 000 additional poor children ; $ 100 million for the important Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) program , which provides nutrition for poor pregnant women , their infants and their other children ; $ 200 million to provide child_care for approximately 44 # 000 youngsters ; $ 200 million to help state-run programs ease infant_mortality and reduce births of low-weight babies ; $ 200 million to immunize 2 million children . This new and needed help would be funded through cuts_in travel budgets_for federal employees . It belongs in the final budget . Head_Start currently accepts poor children starting at 3 and 4 years old . That may be too late . New research indicates that critical development of the brain takes_place during the first three years . To address the shortcoming , Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) would allocate an additional $ 1 billion to expand Head_Start to begin at birth . Business also should help by making_good , affordable child_care available to working parents ; the majority of mothers with_children over the age of 1 work . Authors Lisbeth B . Schorr and Daniel Schorr a_few years ago wrote an important book about breaking the cycle of disadvantage , &quot; Within Our Reach. &quot; The Carnegie report documents that America ' s youngest poor children are indeed within our reach but steadily are slipping_away .</TEXT>
