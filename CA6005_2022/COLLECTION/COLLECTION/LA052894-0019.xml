   <HEADLINE> WILDLIFE ; IT ' S RED , IT BOBS AND IT ' S ACTUALLY A THRUSH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From coast to coast , from south of Texas all_the way to Alaska , the lovely robin raises nestlings on our windowsills and pulls earthworms in the spray of our lawn sprinklers . In spring , its song wakes us at dawn and sings us to sleep at dusk . Did you know , however , that robins are really misnamed thrushes ? Long ago , homesick immigrants , noting the bird ' s resemblance to the European robin red breast , adopted the name as a reminder of home . Whatever people wish to call them , American_robins definitely look and act like thrushes . They have robust breasts and stout , pointed beaks . They run and forage mainly on the ground , lay blue eggs in nests , have spotted young and sing beautifully . Few people know what robins really eat . Earthworms , actually a tiny portion of their diet , are taken mainly while the ground is damp and there are insatiable nestlings begging for soft , easily digested protein . In the southeastern part of the country , robins feast on chinaberries and occasionally consume fallen , fermented fruit until they are quite drunk . More_than one astonished homeowner has gazed onto the front lawn and seen inebriated robins staggering away from the chinaberry bush , unable to fly in a straight_line . Another surprising robin food is the white berry of poison_ivy . Although the oils of this plant cause severe skin reactions in humans , they apparently have no effect on robins , who snap them from their stems and toss them down as eagerly as we would enjoy ripe strawberries . Robins are not above sneaking into orchards to pilfer fruits destined for supermarkets and dinner_tables . In addition to grapes , they will peck figs , pears , apples and blackberries . Most robins content themselves with an ordinary lifestyle and a familiar back-yard behavior . Here are a_few facts that will help you better understand and enjoy robins : * Males , which have noticeably redder breasts and blacker heads than females , return to their breeding territories from mid-February to late April , depending_on latitude . The spring migration follows an average daily temperature of 37 degrees . * Two-year-old and older males usually reclaim the exact territories ( about half an acre ) in which they previously raised broods . Young males return to the neighborhoods in which they were raised and try to find unoccupied sites , which are usually poorer quality . Some first-timers claim vacancies created by males , perhaps their fathers , that did not survive the rigors of winter . * The exuberant , boisterous , cheery robin songs are not so_much love songs to females as threats and warnings to other male robins : &quot; Keep_off my turf ! &quot; * A male will court any hen in his territory by displaying his finery . Because an unattached hen is not yet tied to a territory , she can roam freely from one area to another , pulling a suitor along as if he were_on a string . As soon as the suitor enters another males ' s territory , however , the fight is_on . The fluttering battles one sees in early spring are the result of these territorial romances . * Eventually , each hen will choose a mate , often the same one from the previous year , and the pair will start house hunting . Although males lead hens to possible nesting sites and help deliver building_materials , the female makes the choice and constructs the nest . Nest sites can be anything from sturdy limbs five to 30 feet up a tree to fence posts , street_lamps , stoplights , rain gutters or rock ledges . Construction time varies from one to six days .</TEXT>
