   <HEADLINE> HOW TO BAIL YOURSELF OUT FROM A SEA OF CHRISTMAS DEBT ; CREDIT : FOR MANY , HOLIDAY GLOW TURNS TO A BLANCH WHEN THEY REALIZE THEY OWE MORE THAN THEY HAVE . THERE ' S A RIGHT WAY AND A WRONG WAY TO DEAL WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So you went a little overboard with your kids ' Christmas_presents -- all_right , a lot overboard -- and you probably shouldn ' t have offered to fly all your relatives in_for that New Year ' s reunion . But the magic of the holidays was just too overpowering , you say . Now you ' re paying the price . In fact , for some people , the spirit of the Christmas just past will linger for months ahead as holiday bills roll in and debt collectors follow . Holiday expenses often are compounded by other big winter bills , like higher heating costs , annual insurance_premiums or taxes . &quot; It ' s a tough season . . . ( but ) people really hit the credit_cards , &quot; said Craig J . Costanzo , who runs Management Adjustment Bureau Inc. , a Buffalo , N.Y. , collection agency . To be sure , Visa reported a 32 % jump in retail spending on cards between Thanksgiving and Christmas , compared with the same period in 1992 . MasterCard said charges were up nearly 24 % . Costanzo -- who also is president-elect of the American Collectors Assn . trade group in Minneapolis -- says many of the nation ' s 6 # 000 debt-collection agencies are anticipating a busy spring and summer , when credit issuers start passing_on overdue accounts from the holidays . &quot; It ' s a real growth_industry , &quot; Costanzo said of business . &quot; No . 1 , there ' s more debt to be collected ; No . 2 , credit grantors are cutting staff back and outsourcing more work. &quot; About 227 million accounts totaling $ 75 billion were handed_over to collection agencies in 1992 , the most recent year for which data are available , the ACA says . That compared with 232 accounts and $ 70.6 billion in 1991 . The average recovery rate is 19 cents on the dollar . Of that , debt collectors keep_up to half . While it ' s best to work with a creditor before your account reaches this stage -- at the very least to avoid a poor credit rating -- it ' s also important to understand your rights and responsibilities under the law . You ' re still responsible_for your debts , and the creditor that hired the collection agency can take legal_action against you . But the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act , which became law 15 years ago , outlaws unfair collection practices , including harassment , by collection agencies . &quot; It ' s very important for you to know what your rights are and not to be intimidated by the collector , &quot; said Gerri Detweiler , director of BankCard Holders of America , a consumer group based in Herndon , Va . Detweiler notes , for instance , that collectors cannot call you before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. , cannot use abusive language ; cannot tell others about your debt , even family members ; and cannot collect more_than you owe . You can get debt collectors off your back by simply writing them to cease all communication with you . Detweiler and experts from other consumer groups advise that individuals be honest about debt problems and try to work_out a repayment schedule with the collector . Sometimes , a collector might even accept less than what is owed . Costanzo says collection agencies often will act_as a &quot; financial resource for getting people to work_out their debts. &quot; But he admits abuses sometimes exist in collection practices , especially in the absence of industrywide standards . Sometimes , he says , collectors lose their tempers under pressure . &quot; When people are abusive to you all day you ' re just going_to pop . This is a very difficult business , &quot; Costanzo said . Holly Cherico , a spokeswoman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc. in Arlington , Va. , says most consumer complaints about bill collection agency harassment eventually are settled . The Federal Trade Commission polices serious collector abuse of the law through class-action civil suits . In the past 14 years , the agency said , it has sued 30 collection agencies . Many creditors , particularly larger ones , prefer to bypass debt collectors altogether . &quot; It is the last_resort for us , &quot; said Phil Davis , a senior_vice_president at NationsBank Corp . in Charlotte , N.C. &quot; We will work_out accounts in-house up until the time the account is seven months delinquent and then charge it off . &quot; It gives us that much more control over collections. &quot; Davis said his bank may do things such_as negotiate a lower interest_rate , lower the minimum payment or even waive interest for a time . &quot; Someone who is having some significant personal financial problems . . . because of illness or if they ' re out_of_work , you want to bend over backwards for , &quot; he said . &quot; ( But ) . . . if the consumer has enough income to pay us , we may_not be as flexible with them. &quot; Besides working directly with a creditor , consumers also can turn_to the National Foundation for Consumer_Credit of Silver Spring , Md . More_than 400 # 000 families met last year with counselors at the foundation ' s 1 # 000 offices .</TEXT>
