   <HEADLINE> GENETIC BREAKTHROUGH SEEN IN HUNT FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS CURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists said Thursday that they have wiped_out certain cystic_fibrosis symptoms in mice , an advance in the search for a cure for the inherited disease that usually kills its human victims before their 30th birthdays . The research , being published today in the journal Science , establishes for the first time that the disease in mice can be corrected with a human gene.The work focused_on intestinal symptoms and researchers are now probing whether a similar approach will work_on mice lungs . Researchers took a normal copy of the cystic_fibrosis gene , and inserted it into intestinal cells of mice . These mice had been genetically altered to show characteristics of cystic_fibrosis , including the type of lethal intestinal blockage that strikes human babies with the disease . When the normal gene was inserted , the intestinal symptoms cleared_up . &quot; The mice . . . lived a normal life span , &quot; Whitsett said , even though they would have died within a month without the genetic intervention . The normal gene did not have to be inserted into every affected cell to show these benefits . Treating just one section of the intestine was sufficient . Though the research strongly suggests a cure is feasible , it still remains years away , Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett , director of pulmonary biology at Children ' s Hospital Medical_Center in Cincinnati and the lead author of the Science article , said in a telephone_interview . Cystic fibrosis strikes the lungs , pancreas and intestinal tract , and is the most common genetic_disorder among Caucasians , affecting 1 out of 2 # 000 . People who have the disease cannot transfer salt and water normally across the cells of their lungs and other organs . Thick mucus secretions accumulate , clogging the airways of the lungs .</TEXT>
