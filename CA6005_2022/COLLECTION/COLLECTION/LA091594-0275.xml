   <HEADLINE> SEC TO CRACK_DOWN ON DISHONEST BROKERS IN SMALL- , MID-SIZED FIRMS ; SECURITIES : AGENCY , NASD AND STOCK_EXCHANGES ARE CRITICIZED FOR MOVING TOO SLOWLY TO PROTECT INVESTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed Wednesday that it plans to launch a sweep of small- and medium-sized brokerage_firms across the country to ferret_out evidence of dishonest stockbrokers . SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . announced the sweep at a congressional hearing looking_into the problem of &quot; rogue &quot; stock brokers who repeatedly defraud small investors . Over the next six to eight months , he said , the SEC staff will visit &quot; scores &quot; of brokerage_firm branch offices . Levitt said the sweep will be similar to a series of examinations the SEC has carried_out at the nation ' s nine largest brokerage_houses . In May , the agency said the earlier sweep had led it to open 40 formal disciplinary investigations . &quot; To those who would prey on unsuspecting investors , this is a warning : Clean_up your act , or we ' ll do_it for you , &quot; Levitt said . During the hearing , Rep . Edward J . Markey ( D-Mass. ) , chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance , sharply criticized the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , the New York Stock_Exchange and the SEC , which often take years to bring cases against brokers who blatantly violate securities laws . Referring to specific cases involving small investors , Markey termed the agencies ' response &quot; glacial. &quot; The SEC probes and the House hearing follow a 1992 series in The Times which reported that several of the nation ' s most respected brokerage_firms knowingly hired and retained brokers who had long records of defrauding customers . The series reported that regulators , including the stock_exchanges , often took years to bring charges against brokers , while the brokers went_on to victimize many_more customers . Investor advocates and securities industry officials clashed at the hearing over the extent of problems with rogue brokers and inadequate supervision by brokerages . Marc E . Lackritz , president of the Securities Industry Assn. , said it was a &quot; grotesque mischaracterization of this industry &quot; to suggest that more_than a tiny fraction of the nation ' s 470 # 000 brokers are dishonest . But a state securities regulator and an official of the General Accounting Office said the extent of the problem could be much greater than is currently known . Many informal disciplinary actions against brokers are never reported , they said , and the central computer_system for tracking brokers ' records is severely outmoded . ( The system will soon be overhauled. ) &quot; I don ' t personally believe that this industry is populated with thousands of criminals and bad actors who should be placed in jail . Nor do I feel there are very many ( brokers ) walking_around with halos , &quot; Levitt said . &quot; But I do believe that there are lots of brokers who are walking pretty close to the line. &quot; Mary E . Murray , 75 , a widow and retired Latin teacher from Cape_Cod , Mass. , testified that over a five-year period ending in 1990 , a Prudential Securities broker &quot; churned &quot; her $ 99 # 000 account -- ultimately costing her over $ 125 # 000 in losses . Churning involves rapidly buying and selling securities to generate commissions for the broker . In 1992 , arbitrators awarded Murray a $ 419 # 000 judgment against Prudential and the broker , Gerald R . Swirsky , criticizing their &quot; open-eyed , reckless disregard &quot; of Murray ' s interests . Neither the NASD nor NYSE has taken disciplinary action against Swirsky , though an official testified that the NASD expected to file charges soon . Now a broker with Tucker Anthony in Boston , Swirsky has been the subject of other formal complaints . Reached by phone after the hearing , he declined comment .</TEXT>
