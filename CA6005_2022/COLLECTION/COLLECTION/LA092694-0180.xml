   <HEADLINE> RABIN , ARAFAT DISCUSS MORE ARAB SELF-RULE IN W . BANK ; MIDEAST : GAZA MEETING IS CALLED PAIR ' S FRIENDLIEST . BUT THEY MAKE NO HEADWAY ON SCHEDULING PALESTINIAN ELECTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat on Sunday discussed extending Palestinian self-rule throughout the West_Bank , but they set no date for Palestinian elections . &quot; We are for elections , &quot; Rabin told reporters after two hours of talks with Arafat and other senior Palestinian officials . &quot; But we have to know what will be elected , what will be the spheres of the elected body as well as the question of redeployment. &quot; The two leaders held what both sides described as their friendliest meeting just three hours after a knife-wielding Palestinian stabbed and seriously injured a 17-year-old Jewish settler at the entrance to Neve Dekalim , a Jewish settlement 20 miles south of Erez . The Erez checkpoint separates Gaza from pre-1967 Israel . The settler , Yaacov Fisher , was reported in stable condition at a Beersheba hospital later in the day . He had moved to the settlement six weeks ago with his parents , who wanted to show solidarity with Jewish settlers in Gaza , Israel Radio reported . The attacker , identified as Mustafa Mohammed Hila , 18 , from Khan Yunis , a Palestinian village in Gaza , was shot dead by Israeli soldiers guarding the settlement . He reportedly had a leaflet of the Islamic movement Hamas in his pocket . Hamas later denied that it was involved in the attack . &quot; This is not only a challenge against us or against the Israeli side , this is a challenge against the peace process , &quot; Arafat told reporters when asked about Palestinian attacks on Israelis . &quot; These elements are trying to touch , or harm , the peace process . We are completely against it , and we have , we promised his excellency ( Rabin ) , to do all our best to stop it. &quot; Rabin and Arafat agreed to start negotiating in Cairo next Monday the terms for West_Bank and Gaza Strip elections . Arafat has publicly set Nov . 1 as the deadline for holding elections , but both Israeli and Palestinian officials say privately that it is unlikely elections will be held this year . The two sides remain far apart on their concept of the powers a Palestinian body will have in the territories during the interim period of limited self-rule before Israel and the Palestinians negotiate the final status of territories Israel has occupied since the June , 1967 , Arab-Israeli War . The Palestinians want to elect a legislative body of more_than 100 parliamentarians with broad responsibilities for making laws in what they hope will be the future Palestinian state . The Israelis favor a small executive_council with limited lawmaking authority . The two sides also differ over how Palestinians living_in East Jerusalem will participate in elections . According to the Declaration of Principles signed by the two sides in Washington a year ago , Israel must redeploy its troops out of Palestinian population centers before elections are held . The question of redeployment is considered politically sensitive for Rabin , because he must be able to guarantee the security of more_than 100 # 000 Jewish settlers , some of whom live inside the Palestinian town of Hebron in the West_Bank . Rabin is known to differ sharply with his foreign_minister , Shimon Peres , over how quickly to move toward redeployment and elections . Peres favors speeding_up negotiations with the Palestinians , while Rabin favors a more cautious approach , tied to Palestinian success in controlling attacks against Jews by Palestinians in Gaza and to the Palestinian Authority ' s competence in running Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho , which Israel handed_over to the PLO in May . &quot; We did not discuss dates , &quot; Rabin said in response to reporters ' questions about when elections will be held . &quot; The date will be decided by the results of the negotiations. &quot; Arafat said he still hopes to hold elections in November . Speaking_to reporters in Jerusalem , Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said Israel should begin preparing now to withdraw its troops from Palestinian towns and villages in the West_Bank . The Palestinians have accused Rabin of deliberately dragging his feet on elections because he is reluctant to pull Israeli troops out of large parts of the West_Bank . But although Israeli officials say it is unrealistic to hold elections in November , they insist that Israel is not interested in delays . &quot; We have no interest in putting_off the elections , &quot; said Environment Minister Yossi Sarid , who accompanied Rabin to Sunday ' s meeting with Arafat . &quot; On the contrary , we have an interest in having the elections take_place as soon as possible. &quot; Sarid told Israel Radio that the meeting was the most successful meeting between Rabin and Arafat to date . Arafat presented Rabin with an antique Torah scroll from Yemen , for which Rabin publicly thanked the former guerrilla leader . Rabin told reporters that the two agreed to meet again within a month to ensure that progress is being made toward elections .</TEXT>
