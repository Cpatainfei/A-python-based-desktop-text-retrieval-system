   <HEADLINE> SEPARATED BY DIFFERENCES ; HOW DO THE LAWS OF THE LAND INSTITUTIONALIZE DISCRIMINATION ? ; CREATED EQUAL : WHY GAY RIGHTS MATTER TO AMERICA , BY MICHAEL NAVA AND ROBERT DAWIDOFF ( ST . MARTIN ' S PRESS : $ 16.95 ; 144 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We live today in a fragmented culture , a place of sectarianism and special_interests , where the focus tends more to the things that separate us than to the things we share . It ' s an unfortunate development -- although , perhaps , inevitable , given the promises this country has made and broken to the disenfranchised over the years -- for it comes_with an accompanying narrowness of vision , a sense that we should just pay_attention to our own back yards . Yet despite history ' s failings , the essential strength of American democracy has always been its goal of community , its philosophy of empowerment for all . Michael Nava and Robert Dawidoff note in &quot; Created Equal : Why Gay Rights Matter_to America &quot; : &quot; Identity politics based on ethnicity , gender , class , or religion is the order_of_the_day . But the faith remains . . . that liberty is advanced by the wider access of all sorts of people to fundamental civil and human rights. &quot; &quot; Created Equal &quot; is an attempt to apply the rhetoric of the Civil Rights movement to the cause of gay equality , bypassing the issue ' s more emotional aspects in favor of a carefully considered argument for &quot; the principle of equal protection under the law. &quot; Originally prompted by Governor Wilson ' s September , 1991 , veto of &quot; a bill that would have prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation , &quot; Nava and Dawidoff -- the former a lawyer , the latter a professor of history at the Claremont Graduate_School -- contend that homosexual rights are not a matter of special treatment , but rather a classic case of minority empowerment that has relevance to everyone , straight or gay , who believes_in America ' s democratic ideals . This assertion is so clearly true that it hardly seems , at first glance , to need restating . It ' s only common_sense that the laws of a free nation should be applied equally , no matter what . But common_sense has little to do with the attitudes of people who &quot; think that ( they ) neither want nor need to know about gays and lesbians , &quot; and it is to them that the authors have addressed this book . Beginning with a discussion of sodomy statutes -- even now , oral and anal sex is illegal in 23 states -- they expose the institutionalized intolerance faced by homosexuals in the U.S. &quot; Sodomy laws , &quot; they explain , &quot; however lax or intermittent their enforcement , are the foundation of discrimination , hindering family formation and preventing legalized same-sex marriage . They justify second-class citizenship and cannot be looked_upon honestly without acknowledging that they still stigmatize certain citizens , making them virtual outlaws , and encourage and reinforce prejudice against those citizens whether or not they break the law. &quot; With that as a starting point , Nava and Dawidoff discuss the ways in which legislation and discrimination interact . Why , they ask , are gay couples denied the right of matrimony , and the consequent benefits -- financial , legal and emotional -- it allows ? How could homosexuality be sufficient cause for a Virginia woman to lose custody of her child ? Central to their argument is the 1986 case of Bowers vs . Hardwick , in which the Supreme Court upheld Georgia ' s sodomy law after it was challenged by a gay_man arrested in his own home for being in bed with another man . Although the court had consistently extended the right of heterosexual privacy in cases such_as Roe vs . Wade , Justice Byron White concluded in Bowers that &quot; constitutional guarantees of liberty do not ' extend a fundamental right to homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy . . . . Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots. ' &quot; But , as Nava and Dawidoff rightly suggest , the idea that something should be proscribed because it has always been so is ridiculous , a logic of prejudice , not of law . To drive_home the point , they quote none other_than Oliver Wendell Holmes : &quot; It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule_of_law than that it was laid_down in the time of Henry_IV . It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid_down have vanished long since , and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past. &quot; For all_the power of its arguments , however , &quot; Created Equal &quot; has its problems , principally the authors ' propensity for academic language , and their distracting habit of reiterating major themes . In addition , their tendency to harp on the evils of fundamentalist religion becomes a little tiresome after a while . I ' m no fan of the religious right , but when it comes_to homosexual equality , Christian zealots are just the most visible of the opposition forces ; as Nava and Dawidoff themselves admit , &quot; the revulsion many men and women feel at the thought of sexual_activity between people of_their_own sex remains a formidable obstacle on the path of gay rights. &quot; Such qualifications to the contrary , Nava and Dawidoff appear at times consumed by the idea that &quot; the opposition to gay rights is the advance guard of the religious right ' s wholesale invasion of the political life of this country . . . . Although gays are the present target of the counterrevolution , the rest of America is not far behind. &quot; It is , in fact , the subject of &quot; Created Equal ' s &quot; longest chapter , a 38-page jeremiad called &quot; God Hates Fags , &quot; which , although powerful and moving , relates only indirectly to the legal questions at the heart of the book . Given the indifference , if not the outright hostility , most of the straight America has toward homosexuality , I can understand the temptation to tie gay rights to some larger specter of oppression that should concern us all . At the same time , though , I disagree_with the contention that the religious right has shaped anti-gay attitudes to suit its own cause . More likely , it is the attitudes that have fostered an environment where fundamentalists can plant their poison and watch it take_root -- a truth even Nava and Dawidoff seem to recognize . &quot; We do not expect that if constitutional protections are extended_to gay and lesbian Americans , the derogatory stereotypes and beliefs about them will immediately disappear , &quot; they write . &quot; But if they are ever to disappear , the state must , at the very least , stop perpetuating them by using them to deny gays and lesbians their basic rights. &quot; After all , if gay rights do matter_to America -- and of course they do -- it ' s not because they represent the front_line in the battle against the religious right . Instead , they matter because the diminishing of any citizen diminishes us all , because in a society that calls itself democratic , no one is truly free unless everyone is . That is the crux here , the issue that will not go_away . And the sooner we accept it , the better_off we ' ll be .</TEXT>
