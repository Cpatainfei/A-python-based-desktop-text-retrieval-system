   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY ; EXHIBIT FOCUSES ON THE WORLD OF CHRISTMAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only 19 months into this world , Evann Hall gazed around with ever-widening eyes that reflected the light and the promise of many Christmases to come . Or at least 30 versions of Christmas , each from a different land -- China , Brazil , Russia -- whose decorated trees left him giddy with excitement at the Christmas Around the World exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley . &quot; Mickey_Mouse , Mickey_Mouse , &quot; a squirming Evann cried , inaccurately , from the arms of his mother as he gazed at a galaxy of lights swirling about a Christmas_tree that spoke_of a land halfway around the world , Japan . No matter that the toddler was off a bit . The ornaments featuring Mickey_Mouse and other Walt Disney characters , brought_to life by 1 # 100 blazing white lights , dangled from the plastic green limbs of a tree behind him . His mother , 34-year-old Jenny Hall of Newbury Park , gazed at the trees_lining the library hall -- Ireland and Japan to one side , Iceland and Italy to another -- and said , &quot; They ' re gorgeous. &quot; The exhibit , which opened Nov . 19 and continues through Jan . 9 , features 30 Christmas_trees that reflect the traditions of the countries that Ronald and Nancy Reagan visited during their eight years in the White_House . All mock Douglas firs , the trees differ only in the decorations -- the garlands , the ornaments and the other symbols -- that characterize each particular country . They were decorated by community organizations , school groups and ethnic and fraternal groups . The exhibit was privately funded . &quot; It ' s such a wonderful way to start the holiday season , &quot; said Carole Jouroyan , 52 , of Glendale . &quot; It ' s just breathtaking . Every tree is a work of art. &quot; &quot; And the prettiest one is the USA tree , &quot; said her cousin , Michael Elanjian , 72 , from Philadelphia . Moments earlier , Jouroyan had strolled down the row of firs in the adjoining hall , pausing to soak in the lights and the ornaments of trees from England and Germany , Norway and the Philippines , lost in a reverie of Christmas past and Christmas future . Steve Tracy ' s interest was more practical . Appraising the &quot; sports tree &quot; whose limbs were loaded_down with tiny baseballs , footballs and basketballs , the 26-year-old Simi Valley man said , &quot; I ' d like to buy this tree for my business. &quot; He owns MVP Sports Bar and Grill in Simi Valley , he said . Earlier , two young Camarillo friends , 7-year-old Andrew Strickenburg and 4-year-old Brian Dixon , knelt and held hands in front of the same tree , looking_up in awe . &quot; I like it , &quot; Andrew said in shy understatement .
