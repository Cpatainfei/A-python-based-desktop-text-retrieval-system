   <HEADLINE> HUFFINGTON HITCHES HIS U.S. SENATE_RACE TO ' 3 STRIKES '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First-term Rep . Michael Huffington , preparing to run_for the U.S. Senate , has signed_on as the chief bankroller and co-chairman of the hottest political ticket going_in California : the proposed &quot; three strikes &quot; anti-crime initiative . Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) contributed about $ 100 # 000 of_his_own money to help qualify the initiative for the November ballot , and he agreed to help direct the campaign along with Mike Reynolds , the father of an 18-year-old murder victim . The freshman congressman seeking to unseat Democratic Sen . Dianne Feinstein said he is acting_as a concerned citizen and the father of two young daughters , not as a candidate . that ' s why , he said , he did not identify his political affiliations in a radio commercial he recently made_for the proposed initiative . &quot; When I read about Polly Klaas ' abduction , it just made me mad , &quot; said Huffington , referring to the kidnaping and murder last year of a 12-year-old Petaluma girl . &quot; I was fed up and I wanted to do something about it. &quot; Crime promises to be one of the major issues in the coming election year , and nothing has proved more irresistible for the 1994 candidates than the initiative that seeks a life sentence for habitual_criminals . &quot; Three strikes and you ' re out &quot; -- as the measure is called -- has been endorsed by most of the leading candidates for statewide office , and in a recent poll it was supported by a whopping 84 % of the state ' s voters . Huffington ' s support for the initiative is not likely to distinguish him from the two other major candidates in the U.S. Senate_race because it is also backed by Feinstein and Republican challenger William E . Dannemeyer . But his leadership role in the initiative campaign will help him achieve the first task he faces in his Senate bid : introducing himself to an electorate that does not know him . He said it should also demonstrate his leadership and commitment on the issue because he is &quot; putting my money where my mouth is. &quot; &quot; A lot of politicians say they are for it , but very few people put_up the commitment to make_sure it gets qualified , &quot; said Huffington , 46 , a former banker and the son of a wealthy Texas oilman . &quot; If I had not been able to step into this , I ' m not sure we would have a measure on the ballot. &quot; The initiative ' s sponsors said the campaign needs another 50 # 000 signatures -- for a total of about 600 # 000 -- before March 7 in_order to be sure the plan qualifies for the November ballot . Reynolds said the effort has been costly and when money was short he went_to Huffington seeking financial help . He said Huffington ' s contribution represents about a quarter of the campaign ' s funds . Huffington ' s rivals said his role on the initiative highlights his light public record . Huffington won his first public office in 1992 when he spent a record $ 5.4 million to unseat a veteran Republican congressman . Asked whether he had been involved in anti-crime measures before , Huffington said : &quot; This is the first initiative I ' ve seen in a while that makes sense. &quot; As for his role in the House , he said : &quot; The liberal leadership has not allowed us to play a role in anything that is significant. &quot; Feinstein aides have promised that one of the central themes of the senator ' s campaign will be to contrast her experience as a public leader with Huffington ' s lack of a record . They said the crime issue and the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative is an example . &quot; What he has been able to do because of his hundreds of millions of dollars in personal wealth is . . . try to buy a legislative record , &quot; said Kam Kuwata , Feinstein ' s California director . &quot; I think that ' s what distinguishes the two candidates . One is passing laws in the Congress , and the other is trying to buy a record. &quot; Dannemeyer made a similar complaint . &quot; He ' s seeking to use his personal wealth to make himself . . . seem to be strong on crime , &quot; the former Orange County congressman said . &quot; The voters will sort_out what his motivation is. &quot; It is not new for a candidate seeking statewide office to sponsor a concurrent initiative , although the tactic has met with mixed results in the past . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . successfully rode a campaign reform measure into the governor ' s office when he was elected in 1974 . But in 1990 , Democratic gubernatorial candidate John K . Van de Kamp ' s campaign was bogged down with three initiatives that drained precious time and resources from the candidate . &quot; I think largely candidates have made a mistake in trying to identify themselves with initiatives , &quot; said Sal Russo , a Republican political consultant in Sacramento . &quot; More often than not , it ' s not a very effective tactic , although there are obviously notable exceptions. &quot; Huffington said he plans to campaign for the initiative around the state on talk radio programs and in news_conferences . Once it qualifies for the ballot , he said , he will continue to promote the measure to make_sure it passes in November , although he is uncertain whether he will contribute more money . But sponsors of the initiative said there is some question about whether it will have to go before the voters . The state Legislature is considering five &quot; three strikes &quot; -style bills , including one that is virtually identical to the initiative . Reynolds said that if Gov . Pete Wilson signs a sufficiently similar bill before March 7 , he might drop the initiative campaign . Huffington disagreed_with that approach , saying the initiative would still be necessary because it would be harder to modify or repeal than legislation . &quot; that ' s a key point , &quot; he said . If Huffington ' s role in the anti-crime initiative is unconventional , his supporters said it is an indication of the style that should be expected from a unique candidate who is not a product of the political Establishment . They said it demonstrates that he follows his own judgment instead of seeking the most politically expeditious route . &quot; Understand one thing about Michael Huffington -- he is moved by his conscience , &quot; said Carlos Rodriguez , an adviser to Huffington ' s campaign . &quot; These are things he firmly believes_in . These are things that move him whether he is an individual or a candidate running_for office. &quot;</TEXT>
