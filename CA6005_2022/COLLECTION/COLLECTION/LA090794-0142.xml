   <HEADLINE> UCI POLL SEES TROUBLE FOR WILSON , HUFFINGTON ; POLITICS : GOVERNOR , SENATE CANDIDATES BELOW MARGINS NEEDED IN O.C. TO OFFSET DEMOCRAT EDGE IN STATE . SUPPORT STRONG FOR IMMIGRANT , CRIME MEASURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even though they are leading in Orange County , Gov . Pete Wilson and Republican U.S. Senate nominee Mike Huffington face &quot; an uphill fight &quot; here , with voter support below the 2-to-1 ratios they would need on Election_Day to offset Democratic strongholds elsewhere in the state , according to UC Irvine poll results released Wednesday . The poll showed that Wilson , with 50 % support , has failed to increase his popularity in this Republican-rich county since the June primary , and that he and his Democratic challenger , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , have only &quot; tepid support &quot; from local voters . For Wilson , the only good news in the poll is that he is leading Brown in Orange County by 18 points among all registered voters ( 22 points among likely voters ) . Huffington , meanwhile , is running below the 52 % GOP voter registration in Orange County , according to the poll conducted by Mark Baldassare , chairman of urban and regional planning at the UCI School of Social Ecology , and research associate Cheryl Katz . The poll showed Huffington , the Santa Barbara congressman , with 49 % support , compared to 36 % for incumbent U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein , and 11 % undecided . &quot; This is good news for Feinstein , who very well may have enough momentum statewide to get reelected if Huffington receives less than the majority vote_in Orange County , &quot; Baldassare said . Demonstrating that voters this year are more focused on issues than on the candidates or political_parties , the poll also showed that both Democrats and Republicans enthusiastically support two initiatives on the Nov . 8 general_election dealing with crime and immigration . Proposition 184 , the &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing law for convicted felons , was backed by 84 % of the voters . Proposition 187 , which would deny public_services , such_as education and non-emergency health_care , to illegal immigrants received a 65 % approval rating . Support for Proposition 187 dropped to 54 % among Democrats . The telephone poll of 812 registered voters was conducted from Aug . 19 to Aug . 29 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 % . The poll , part of UCI ' s 1994 Orange County Annual Survey , was touted as a &quot; special report &quot; on the upcoming November election . Baldassare said he was somewhat surprised by Wilson ' s showing in the poll because he expected that the governor would have recovered his standing by now after giving_up 43 % of the Orange County Republican vote to political neophyte Ron Unz in the primary . Instead , he said , Wilson is no better_off now than he was at this same point in the 1990 campaign , and the governor will have to work hard to get the large vote margin that he needs in Orange County to offset Democratic strongholds in Los Angeles and San Francisco . &quot; This tells me he has an uphill fight in Orange County , &quot; Baldassare said . One out of every five Democrats said they would vote for Wilson , while 13 % of the Republicans said they would support Brown . Independents were evenly divided between the two candidates . In the Huffington-Feinstein race , each candidate lost one out of every five voters to the opposite party , with independents also equally divided between both camps . Unlike previous years , independent voters can no longer be expected to vote Republican because they are becoming more issues-oriented , Baldassare said . &quot; We can partly thank ( 1992 independent presidential candidate ) Ross Perot for those trends . He freed up independents and a certain number of voters to view both parties with greater skepticism , &quot; the pollster said . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s a lot of enthusiasm for either gubernatorial candidate in Orange County , &quot; Baldassare concluded . &quot; That means the outcome of this election may very well come_down to how the candidates deal with the voters ' top concerns -- crime and illegal immigration. &quot; Based on that barometer , the Wilson campaign claims an advantage over Brown because of her personal objection to the death_penalty -- which she has vowed to carry_out if elected governor -- and her opposition to Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration measure , on the Nov . 8 ballot . &quot; The battleground is slowly shifting for the independent voters and swing voters , &quot; said Dan Schnur , the Wilson campaign spokesman . &quot; The more they learn about the two records , the more they are going_to support Pete Wilson . She can pretend she ' s just as tough as Pete Wilson on both of those issues , but when push comes_to shove and the dust is cleared , she ' s ( former Gov. ) Jerry Brown ' s sister and she ' s against the death_penalty and she ' s against SOS ( the so-called ' Save Our State ' initiative ) . &quot; Schnur downplayed the UCI poll results , adding that the Wilson campaign ' s own numbers in Orange County show the governor with a slightly higher approval rating among &quot; likely voters , &quot; and with conservatives providing the foundation of the support . But by its own action , the Wilson campaign has shown the importance of the Orange County vote_in the upcoming election . During August alone , Wilson held four public events and two fund-raisers here , with his wife , Gayle , also making campaign appearances . Asked why Wilson is having to fight for political territory that would normally be the Republican nominee ' s stronghold , Schnur replied : &quot; These are voters with very high expectations . It ' s very difficult to penetrate the L.A. media market -- and the Orange County media market in particular -- from Sacramento. &quot; Brown ' s campaign , meanwhile , was ecstatic over the UCI poll , even though it showed Brown with only 32 % support . &quot; It ' s great news for Kathleen Brown , &quot; said John Whitehurst , her campaign spokesman . &quot; We are already farther ahead than Feinstein was in 1990. &quot; In the 1990 gubernatorial election , Feinstein took 31 % of the Orange County vote while Wilson racked_up 63 % . &quot; Wilson does not have his base intact . His job rating continues to be in the toilet ; he does not have the support of independents that he had in 1990 , &quot; Whitehurst said . Pointing_out that Wilson needs 64 % support from Orange County voters to overcome the expected Democratic lead elsewhere , Whitehurst concluded : &quot; These results show that Wilson is in deep trouble in Orange County and in deep trouble statewide. &quot; While crime and immigration continue to be the foremost issues among voters , Wilson ' s embracement of those issues has not directly resulted in increased popularity , Whitehurst added . Wilson ' s Vote Margin Republican Gov . Pete Wilson has a wide margin over Democrat Kathleen Brown in Orange County , but it may_not be enough for him to offset a large Demcratic turnout elsewhere in the state . * If the election for governor were held today , would you vote for : Wilson : 50 % Brown : 32 % Other : 6 % Don ' t know : 12 % Source : 1994 Orange County Annual Survey , UCI Wilson Facing Trouble ? Gov . Pete Wilson ' s edge here may_not be enough to cancel the traditional big Democratic majorities in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties . In the Senate_race , Rep . Mike Huffington ' s lead over incumbent Dianne Feinstein is somewhat smaller than Wilson ' s over Democratic nominee Kathleen Brown .
