   <HEADLINE> MEXICO REBELS TAKE_PRIDE IN OWN DEMOCRACY ; TRADITION : A HYBRID OF INDIAN CUSTOMS AND LIBERATION THEOLOGY , THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS EMPHASIZES CONSENSUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Half-squatting on the narrow benches of the cramped one-room schoolhouse , seven delegates from the village of Ibarra mopped sweat from their foreheads with red bandannas and took turns writing notes in a graph-paper tablet . At the head of the classroom , a man in a white palm-leaf hat was talking in Tzeltal , the most common of the four indigenous languages spoken in Ibarra and in the region of the southern state of Chiapas where peasants rose_up against the Mexican government on New Year ' s Day . The villagers followed his comments on a 32-page document . Written in Spanish , the document was used by the Zapatista National Liberation Army to analyze the peace proposal the government made in March . The rebels rejected the proposal last month after a three-month consultation process that began at meetings like this one , though last week they agreed to resume talks . Harsh critics of the government ' s lack of democracy , the Zapatistas take_pride in their own decision-making process , a form of referendum they call consultation with the masses . The results of that process surprised some analysts , not because the peace plan was rejected but because of the margin by which it was rejected : 97.88 % . &quot; Any time a government or organization claims to have gotten 98 % of the vote , I get skeptical , &quot; wrote Sergio Sarmiento , political columnist for the business newspaper El Financiero . But experts who have studied villages in the despoiled remnants of this rain_forest say the numbers are reasonable because the style of democracy practiced here emphasizes consensus rather than confrontation . &quot; There is never a 60-40 vote_in indigenous communities , &quot; said Neil Harvey , a political_scientist at Brown University who has done research in Chiapas . &quot; They keep discussing it until everybody is in_agreement . This can take from several days to several months. &quot; Zapatista democracy is a hybrid of Indian customs and the ideas brought_to the jungle by social_workers and priests who believed_in liberation theology , a movement in the Roman_Catholic_Church that emphasizes grass-roots religion and cooperation . As the rain_forest was settled over the past three decades , those ideas have developed in a climate of betrayal by a succession of leaders that has fostered a general distrust of leadership . The result is an elaborate form of direct democracy that relies_on constant consultation with the rank_and_file . &quot; Long before they took_up arms , there was a tradition of collective decision-making , &quot; said Luis Hernandez , a social critic who works in a cooperative for coffee growers with plots smaller than five acres , like many in this jungle . Indian settlers from the Chiapas highlands brought the tradition of cooperation with them when they began to colonize the jungle in the 1960s , he said . That foundation was reinforced by the priests who accompanied the settlers . They encouraged the colonists by turning their sojourn into a pilgrimage to the Promised Land with readings from Exodus -- translated into Tzeltal . They also educated villagers who showed leadership skills and developed the kind of grass-roots Christian base communities that were evolving throughout Latin_America . These were communities of believers who worked together to overcome their miserable conditions and to build a better future . &quot; They promoted collective practices and reinforced the role of the family and the community , &quot; Hernandez said . The church remains vital in isolated jungle communities . Every day at dusk , the church_bell in Ibarra rings and villagers file quietly into the settlement ' s only painted building . They pray silently for five minutes and then resume their daily chores . Collective decision-making was honed during the 1970s , when the colonists were threatened with expulsion because of government efforts to save the last North_American rain_forest . Ibarra was one of the villages scheduled for destruction . &quot; We knew that we all had to work together or we would lose everything , &quot; recalled one middle-aged man who , like many Zapatista sympathizers , refused to identify himself . Villagers banded_together with the help of outsiders from the northern city of Torreon who had organized poor urban neighborhoods to demand services , Hernandez said . Known as the Union of the People , they firmly believed_in Mao Tse-tung ' s ideas of confidence in the masses . Their ideology fit well with the collective traditions developing among the Lacandon settlers . In those days , once a decision was reached , settlers would pitch_in money to send a representative to the state_capital to make their demands known . Occasionally , they raised the $ 200 air fare to the nearest town with a paved road , where the representative could catch a bus . Normally , the person chosen walked or rode a mule for four days over muddy trails to town . The result was usually the same . &quot; They sold us out , &quot; said an outspoken woman who gave her name as Oralia . &quot; They came_back with new boots , new clothes and no results. &quot; After 15 years of struggle , the government redrew the boundaries for the Lacandon reserve in 1989 and let the settlers keep the land they now farm but prohibited further incursions into the jungle . The experience undercut the settlers ' faith in representatives but helped them build a structure for making collective decisions and resisting the government together . Harvey witnessed the decision-making process while doing field research seven years ago in Venustiano Carranza , a town near the region now controlled by the rebels . &quot; They were deciding whether to lead a demonstration to the state_capital in Tuxtla Gutierrez , &quot; he recalled , &quot; whether that was the correct action to take , or to continue negotiating with the government. &quot; The issue , as it often is in Chiapas , was a land dispute . A demonstration would require a trek to the city , carrying supplies , sleeping outdoors and leaving land and livestock to the care of a_few who stayed behind . The product of all that sacrifice might simply be angering the government and spoiling the negotiations . The question was hashed out over two days of assemblies . &quot; Core_groups of leaders did most of the talking , &quot; Harvey said . &quot; They would break_up into small groups that drew their own conclusions , then went_back to the general assembly. &quot; By the time they finished , everyone had agreed they should march_on the state_capital . Even reporters taking the pulse of rebel sentiment are expected to conduct interviews in front of the entire community . An assembly is called , and everyone who wants to speak expresses a viewpoint on each question . And everyone listens . When private conversations about this year ' s crop or village history turn_to political questions , Zapatistas usually demur politely , suggesting , &quot; Let ' s save that for the assembly. &quot; Based on that tradition , the seven delegates from Ibarra hiked for two days from their village to a rebel base camp to hear Zapatista representatives explain the peace proposal . &quot; We all came_to make_sure we understood , &quot; one man said in a group interview during a break_in the assembly . &quot; Relying_on one person could lead to mistakes. &quot; That was a diplomatic way of saying that Zapatista villages no longer trust a single delegate . &quot; Sending a committee is a kind of guarantee , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; They keep_an_eye_on each other. &quot; The Ibarra delegation took its responsibilities seriously , filling the graph-paper tablet with explanations for words that do not translate easily from Spanish into Tzeltal , such_as autonomy . Once all_the delegates were certain they understood the proposal , they returned to their communities to discuss the plan . Photos in the Mexico_City newspaper La Jornada showed voting by raised hands and tallies on chalkboards , which most reporters were not allowed to see . That glimpse of Zapatista democracy contrasts sharply with the federal elections that rebels watched in 1991 . Only 104 voter precincts were set_up in Ocosingo -- a county about half the size of Delaware in a state where barely one-fifth of the roads are paved . Most of the Zapatista-held territory is in Ocosingo . &quot; In order to vote , peasants had to walk for hours , &quot; Hernandez said . Nevertheless , election results show that 20 # 931 people voted_in Ocosingo in 1991 , nearly 200 voters per precinct . Less than three years before residents took_up arms against the government , 72 % voted for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , according to official vote tallies . Hernandez does not believe those figures . &quot; It ' s obvious that they stuffed the ballot_boxes , &quot; he said . &quot; The election did not reflect the concerns of the voters. &quot; With that history , observers said , Zapatistas are understandably skeptical about the presidential elections scheduled Aug . 21 . While no one expects the federal_government to transform the national political_system into the elaborate consultation system common in Indian communities , some observers say the government could learn from the Zapatistas . &quot; The regime of a ruling party is over , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; It must be modified into a democratic system. &quot;</TEXT>
