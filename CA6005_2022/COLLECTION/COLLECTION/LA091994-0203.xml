   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; ' MISSION STILL HAS RISKS AND WE MUST BE PREPARED , ' CLINTON SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here is the text of President Clinton ' s announcement Sunday night about Haiti : My fellow Americans , I want to announce that the military_leaders of Haiti have agreed to step_down from power . The dictators have recognized that it is in their best interest and in the best interest of the Haitian people to relinquish power peacefully , rather than to face imminent action by the forces of the multinational coalition we are leading . Our objective over the last three years has been to make_sure that the military dictators leave power and that the democratically elected government is returned . This agreement guarantees both those objectives . It minimizes the risks for American forces and the forces of the 24 nations of the international coalition . And the coalition maximizes the orderly transfer of power to Haiti ' s democratically elected government . This is a good agreement for the United States and for Haiti . The military_leaders will leave . The United States and coalition forces will arrive , beginning tomorrow ( Monday ) , and they ' ll do so in_conditions that are less dangerous , although still not without risk . Human_Rights It will be much easier to preserve human_rights , and there is a real chance of a more orderly and less violent transfer of power . And to the supporters of President ( Jean-Bertrand ) Aristide , he will be returned . I ask that all Haitians remember what President Aristide said just a_couple_of days ago , no vengeance , no violence , no retribution , this is a time for peace . That is what the United States is going , along with our coalition partners , to work for . As all_of you know , at my request President ( Jimmy ) Carter , Gen . Colin Powell and Sen . Sam Nunn went_to Haiti to facilitate the dictators ' departure just yesterday ( Saturday ) . I have been in constant contact with them for the last two days . They have worked tirelessly , almost around the clock , and I want to thank them for undertaking this crucial mission on behalf of all Americans . Just as important , I want also to thank the men and women of the United States armed forces . It was their presence and their preparations that played a pivotal part in this agreement . Under this agreement the dictators have agreed to leave power as soon as the Haitian Parliament passes an amnesty law as called_for by the Governor ' s Island agreement . But in any event , no later than Oct . 15 . They ' ve agreed to immediate introduction of troops from the international coalition , beginning , as I said , as early as tomorrow ( Monday ) . They have also pledged to cooperate fully with the coalition troops during the peaceful transition of power , something we have wanted very much . I have directed United States forces to begin deployment into Haiti as a part of the U.N. coalition and ( Army Lt. ) Gen . ( Henry ) Sheldon , our commander , will be there tomorrow ( Monday ) . The presence of the 15 # 000-member multinational force will guarantee that the dictators will carry_out the terms of the agreement . It is clear from our discussions with the delegation that this agreement only came because of the credible and imminent threat of the multinational force . In fact , it was signed after Haiti received evidence that paratroopers from our 82nd Airborne Division , based at Ft . Bragg , N.C. , had begun to load_up to begin the invasion which I had ordered to start this ( Sunday ) evening . Indeed , at the time that the agreement was reached , 61 Americans_planes were already in the air . Because of this agreement , the United States and other coalition troops now going_to Haiti will be able to go_in under much more favorable conditions than they would have if the generals had not agreed to relinquish power . But let me emphasize that this mission still has its risks and we must be prepared_for them . Haiti is still a troubled country and there remain possibilities of violence directed at American troops . But this agreement minimizes those risks and maximizes our chance to protect the human_rights of all Haitians , both those who support President Aristide and those who oppose him ; and to create an environment in which President Aristide can return , as he said , without violence , without vengeance , without retribution . Under the terms of U.N. Security_Council Resolution 940 , an international coalition from 25 nations will soon go_into Haiti to begin the task of restoring democratic government . President Aristide will return to Haiti when the dictators depart . Brutal Atrocities On Thursday night , I told you that the United States must act here to protect our interests to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians , to secure our borders and preserve stability and promote democracy in our Hemisphere , to uphold the reliability of commitments that we make to others and the commitments others make to us . This agreement furthers all these goals . From the beginning I have said that the Haitian dictators must go . Tonight I can tell you that they will go . And to our troops tonight who are headed to Haiti under less risky conditions , I am confident that you will carry_out your mission as you already have , effectively and professionally . We depend_upon you to do_well tomorrow as you have done so very well today , and in the weeks and days before , when you planned this exercise , prepared_for it , and then began to carry it out . To all_of you , I say thank_you , your nation is proud_of you . Good_night and God bless America . The Terms The agreement negotiated between the United States and Haiti calls_for : * DEPARTURE : Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby will leave power by Oct . 15 . The post of Lt . Gen . Michel-Joseph Francois , Port-au-Prince police_chief , will be eliminated . The military_leaders do not have to leave the country , though Cedras and Biamby at least are expected to do so . Francois ' future remains unclear . * RETURN : President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , ousted in September , 1991 , will return to Haiti after the military_leaders leave power . * INTERVENTION : The first of 15 # 000 U.S. troops will begin entering Haiti today to make_sure the terms of the agreement are carried_out . This force is just slightly smaller than the planned invasion force and will enter during the day . * PEACEKEEPING : An international coalition from 25 nations will follow the U.S. intervention force into Haiti to begin the task of restoring democratic government . * AMNESTY : Parliament will pass an amnesty law to protect the military_leaders and their supporters from retribution . The military_leaders will leave power after the law is passed , no later than Oct . 15 . * EMBARGO : The agreement says the United Nations ' economic embargo will be lifted ' without delay ' and the needs of the Haitian people will be met ' as quickly as possible.
