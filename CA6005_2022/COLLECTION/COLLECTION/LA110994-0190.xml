   <HEADLINE> SRI LANKA ' S ' WAR OF WIDOWS ' GOES TO POLLS ; ASIA : TWO WOMEN WHOSE HUSBANDS WERE ASSASSINATED HAVE WAGED A BITTER CAMPAIGN FOR TOP JOB . KEY ISSUE IS HOW TO DEAL WITH TAMIL REBELS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like Americans , voters on this verdant Indian_Ocean isle have just been though a wearying , divisive and often negative campaign . But they ' ve also seen one top candidate perish in a bomb_blast and the other blamed for it . Today , Sri Lankans will choose an executive president -- likely the first woman to assume the powerful office . The bitter electoral contest , dubbed the &quot; war of the widows &quot; because both front-runners survived the assassinations of their politician husbands , has turned_into a referendum on the key issue of the day : the government ' s proper stance toward the 11-year-old rebellion by Tamil insurgents . Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was elected to the post of prime_minister in August after pledging to open peace negotiations with the rebels , whose struggle has led to the deaths of 30 # 000 people . On Oct . 24 , the day the second set of talks was supposed to begin , Kumaratunga ' s top opponent in the race for the presidency , Gamini Dissanayake , died when a bomb exploded at a late-night campaign rally here . The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , who control enclaves in the island ' s north and east , were widely blamed for what police say was a suicide bombing in which 53 others died . Dissanayake ' s 51-year-old widow , Srima , was nominated by the main opposition United National Party to take his place on the ballot . A lawyer who ran_for the first time in an election only last year , she has demanded that the Liberation Tigers lay_down their arms before talks can resume . Dissanayake ' s death embittered an already feverish campaign in this country , where murder and thuggery have frequently been part and parcel of politics . Although his widow has never said it , campaign posters and UNP orators have accused Kumaratunga and her People ' s Alliance of being in cahoots with the Liberation Tigers . Kumaratunga , 49 , broke_off talks with the rebels after the bombing and launched an investigation to determine whether the Liberation Tigers were responsible . If Kumaratunga wins today ' s six-way race handily , as she is widely expected to , many observers expect her to restart the negotiations sooner rather than later . &quot; The ethnic issue is extra important , &quot; said Neelan Tiruchelvam , a lawyer and human_rights activist . &quot; Her ability to address all other issues depends_on success here. &quot; Kumaratunga ' s father and mother both served as Sri Lankan prime_minister . Her father , Solomon Bandaranaike , was assassinated in 1959 by chauvinists from the island ' s majority Sinhalese community . In 1988 , her film star-turned-politician husband , Vijaya Kumaratunga , was gunned_down by Sinhalese leftists . In her bid for the highest office in this island republic of 18 million , Kumaratunga has garnered the support of many leaders of its Muslim and Tamil minorities . She has pledged , if elected , to amend the constitution to eliminate the executive presidency by July , and restore the British-style parliamentary system that Sri Lanka had until 1978 . On Tuesday , Sri Lanka ' s navy said it killed at least seven Tamil rebels in a sea battle after intercepting three rebel boats as they were about to attack a naval landing_craft in the Bay_of_Bengal . Over the weekend , as the campaign came_to a close , four deaths were reported in clashes between followers of rival parties . Bracing for more violence , the government mobilized more_than 40 # 000 police_officers for election_day duty . On the Jaffna peninsula , the rebels ' enclave in the north , the Liberation Tigers said they will not allow voting .</TEXT>
