   <HEADLINE> THE PRONOUNCEMENTS OF PAULINE ; MOVIE LOVERS HAVEN ' T NECESSARILY AGREED WITH CRITIC PAULINE KAEL -- BUT THE MORE HEATED THE DEBATE , THE MORE SHE FELT SHE WAS DOING HER JOB ; FOR KEEPS : THIRTY YEARS AT THE MOVIES , BY PAULINE KAEL ( DUTTON : $ 34.95 ; 1 # 280 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ' Get_out of here with your cowboys_boots , &quot; screamed the anonymous letter sent to Pauline Kael shortly after she became film critic for the New Yorker in 1967 . Recognizing it as the handiwork of one of that magazine ' s contributors &quot; whose prose seemed to be rolled like an English lawn , &quot; Kael wasn ' t irritated -- just surprised . &quot; I didn ' t have cowboy_boots , &quot; she said , recalling the incident in a recent interview , &quot; I ' ve never had cowboy boots. &quot; To anyone who has ever met this petite , personable woman , it ' s rather hard to imagine her as the Billy the Kid of belles-lettres . But once you start reading her reviews , the image of a pistol-packin ' Pauline becomes rather irresistible . If she isn ' t rounding_up a posse to fight_off Oliver Stone and his band of pseudo-intellectual rustlers , then she ' s forming a citizens ' committee to run Robert Altman for sheriff . In fact , just about every Western archetype fits Pauline Kael -- except schoolmarm . &quot; For Keeps , &quot; a massive anthology culled from 10 previously published collections of her writings ( most of which are now out_of_print ) , gives ample evidence as_to why , for the past 30 years , Pauline Kael has been such a singularly lively voice in a profession given to ad-copy puffery and dust-dry platitudes . Her up-close-and-first-personal style ( she claims her goal is &quot; the sound of spoken language &quot; ) and offhand wit ( describing French actress Miou-Miou as &quot; the Brigitte Bardot the cat dragged_in &quot; ) , has made her the most readable of critics -- if not always the most lovable . You don ' t win friends and influence people by calling Fellini ' s &quot; 8 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; a hack ' s notion of Freudian anxiety and wish-fulfillment , &quot; or declaring Dino De Laurentiis ' 1977 remake of &quot; King Kong &quot; to be &quot; a pop classic that can stand_in our affections right next to the original version. &quot; But then , to put it in the rhetorical form she loves ( and her severest critics despise ) , who ever read Pauline Kael expecting to agree with her ? &quot; The hate mail piled_up , &quot; she recalls in the book ' s introduction , speaking_of the atmosphere surrounding the mid-point of her tenure at the New Yorker . &quot; Then , curiously , some of the readers began to enjoy hating me . Maybe my conversational American tone brought them into a closer relationship than they ' d been accustomed to ; maybe what they had first experienced as a crude invasion from the pop world began to be something they looked_forward to. &quot; Or maybe they simply came_to realize that Kael wasn ' t just giving them her straight-from-the-gut unvarnished opinion , she was virtually demanding that they respond in kind : immerse themselves in film as fully and passionately as she did , and talk_about what they saw once they ' d surfaced . And that demand -- to use one of Kael ' s favorite phrases -- was turning them on . When &quot; Bonnie and Clyde &quot; appeared in 1967 , Kael wrote : &quot; The audience is alive to it . Our experience as we watch it has some connection with the way we reacted to movies in childhood : how we came_to love them and feel they were ours -- not an art that we learned over the years to appreciate but simply and immediately ours. &quot; Kael was smack on top of the zeitgeist , explaining why this comedy-drama about Depression-era bank robbers had become a rallying point for young educated audiences of the Vietnam generation . But for the better part of her career Kael , more often than not , found herself not at the center of things , but off to one side . When her taste coincided with that of the masses , on blockbusters like &quot; E.T. , &quot; &quot; Tootsie &quot; and &quot; The Way We Were , &quot; Kael had no trouble getting anyone to listen to her . But she was only able to spur a_few of her readers in the direction of what she aptly called &quot; minority movies &quot; such_as &quot; The Night of the Shooting Stars &quot; and &quot; Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000. &quot; Far more of them lined_up for films Kael despised such_as &quot; A Clockwork Orange &quot; and &quot; Midnight Express. &quot; And there were precious few takers when she went_out on a limb praising the_likes_of &quot; Pennies From Heaven &quot; and &quot; Casualties of War. &quot; You can sense Kael ' s frustration with all_of this in her position-paper-styled essays ( &quot; Trash Art and the Movies , &quot; &quot; Fear of Movies , &quot; &quot; Why Are Movies so Bad ? &quot; ) , where she scores both the industry and the audiences for their lack of adventurousness . But no critic , no matter how well-known or widely read , can influence the movie-making powers-that-be or buck the effect of their enormous marketing and promotional powers . And when a critic is as deliberately contentious as Kael , it ' s hard to credit how descriptive cliches such_as &quot; most powerful &quot; and &quot; most influential &quot; have been attached_to her name . Over the years Kael has come_to be the elder statesperson for a group of younger critics -- Michael Sragow , Peter Rainer and David Ansen among them . One of the most hilarious spectacles in fourth_estate chat circles is listening to the ominous tones her critics take when they talk_about these &quot; Kaelites &quot; -- as if they were a band of Kali-worshiping thugs out of Gunga Din . Though some of them try their best , none of these acolytes has ever managed to write like Kael . Few of them even agree with most of her opinions . And none of them have any clout at the box_office . Moreover , neither does she . A Kael rave has never added so_much as a penny to a project ' s coffers . So_much for &quot; power. &quot; As for &quot; influence , &quot; in 1979 , when Warren Beatty asked her to come_to work for Paramount Pictures as a script adviser , the critic who expended more ink than any other about the way Hollywood should be run , lasted all_of five months . Clearly Kael knew she was better_off back home_in Great Barrington , Mass. , writing_about the &quot; beautiful pipe_dream of a movie &quot; Robert Altman had made in &quot; McCabe and Mrs . Miller &quot; ; the awe-inspiring &quot; vision of Hell &quot; Jean-Luc Godard had conjured_up in &quot; Weekend &quot; ; the way Louis Malle makes_sure that &quot; everything doesn ' t hit you on the noggin &quot; in &quot; Atlantic_City &quot; ; and &quot; the enormous pleasure to see a movie that ' s really about something &quot; she found in &quot; My Beautiful Laundrette. &quot; If Pauline Kael has any &quot; power &quot; or &quot; influence &quot; it is here ; contributing to the literature attendant on works that will withstand the test of time , rather than the &quot; bottom line. &quot; You ' ll find all these examples of Kael at her best in &quot; For Keeps , &quot; along with her witty profile of Cary Grant ( &quot; The Man From Dream City &quot; ) , her refreshingly unstuffy tributes to silent classics ( &quot; Intolerance , &quot; &quot; Napoleon &quot; ) , and her even more refreshing attacks on overstuffed &quot; prestige pictures &quot; ( &quot; Gandhi , &quot; &quot; On Golden Pond &quot; ) . But you will also find what can only be called Kael at her worst -- essays where critical principles are so pulled_out of shape that they begin to dovetail into ethical violations . And it is because of such violations -- which have nothing to do with simple matters of opinion -- that Kael , for all her rhetorical authority , falls_short as a critic . There ' s a constant refrain running_through &quot; For Keeps &quot; ; a hymn of praise directed at films that &quot; don ' t take themselves too seriously. &quot; There ' s nothing particularly alarming about this notion , when Kael is using it to promote the &quot; vitality and distinctive flavor &quot; of commercial Hollywood films ; &quot; the freshness and spirit that make ( them ) unlike those of any other country. &quot; Not unreasonably , she has often found them preferable to the art-house cinema favored by friends of her class ; &quot; academic and professional people , &quot; whose basic indifference to Hollywood has always annoyed her to no end . At one level her cavils have consisted_of little more_than taunting these shrinking violets for avoiding the_likes_of &quot; Hud , &quot; &quot; Convoy , &quot; &quot; Eyes of Laura Mars &quot; or the 1978 remake of &quot; Invasion of the Body_Snatchers &quot; -- slickly made products unaccountably praised by Kael to the skies . But there is something else at_work beneath the surface , this epater l ' academie effrontery : an almost instinctive hatred of seriousness . &quot; An actor ' s scowl , a small subversive gesture , a dirty remark that someone tosses_off with a mock-innocent face , and the world makes a bit of sense , &quot; Kael remarks in one of her position-paper essays . It ' s seems like a perfectly reasonable observation , until you put it alongside others , such_as her complaint about &quot; Blade Runner &quot; : &quot; The moviemakers haven ' t learned that wonderful , simple trick of bringing a character closer to the audience by giving him a joke or having him overreact to one. &quot; Surely a critic capable of appreciating rich , multifaceted , works such_as &quot; The Golden Coach , &quot; &quot; The Leopard &quot; and &quot; Once Upon a Time in America &quot; knows that quality is scarcely incumbent_on cheap , crowd-pleasing gimmicks . Yet throughout &quot; For Keeps , &quot; Kael keeps running to the shelter of films she calls &quot; trash &quot; -- as if doing penance for ever having had anything nice to say about Ingmar Bergman . This would just be a minor quirk if Kael hadn ' t lost her bearings when writing_about a film that was both serious and full of &quot; vitality and spirit &quot; : Orson Welles ' &quot; Citizen Kane. &quot; &quot; Raising Kane , &quot; her two-part 1971 broadside against Welles set_off a firestorm of controversy that hasn ' t subsided to this day . And the heart of that firestorm is Kael ' s peculiar notion of the value of films that &quot; don ' t take themselves seriously. &quot; Welles ' classic 1941 study of a the life and times of a newspaper tycoon closely modeled on William Randolph Hearst has been hailed by countless critics as both a great satire and a complex psychological study . To Kael it was &quot; a comic_strip about Hearst &quot; and precious little more . Seizing_on remarks made by the secretary of co-scriptwriter Herman J . Mankiewicz that Welles &quot; wasn ' t around &quot; when the first draft of the script was written , Kael went_on to declare that Welles had affixed his name on the credits of a script he did not write . &quot; Then I ' d like to know what was all that stuff I was always typing for Mr. Welles ! &quot; shot back the director ' s secretary , Katherine Trosper ( as quoted in Peter Bogdanovich ' s 1992 book , &quot; This Is Orson Welles &quot; ) . Why had Kael , so sympathetic to Welles in 1967 when &quot; Falstaff &quot; ( a.k.a. &quot; Chimes at Midnight &quot; ) was released to hostile reviews , suddenly turned_on him ? It was simple , really . If &quot; Kane &quot; is to matter for her then it can only be a film that &quot; doesn ' t take itself seriously &quot; -- a joke . And Welles , the &quot; boy genius , &quot; lauded by scholars for &quot; Kane ' s &quot; visual richness and dramatic complexity , can ' t be that joke ' s teller . But this is nothing next to Kael ' s most outrageous statement : that in the famous newspaper office , Welles , shown eating a large meal , &quot; was obviously caught by the camera crew , and which , to be a ' good sport ' he had to use. &quot; Orson Welles , the most self-conscious filmmaker the world has ever known , &quot; caught &quot; by his camera crew , cin e ma verite- style ? Does she really expect anybody to believe this ? Yes . For in Kael ' s view , Welles , unable to write a joke , is ideally cast as the butt of one . Still , there are times where such fudging won ' t work , and jokes can ' t help . One such case is &quot; Shoah , &quot; Kael ' s review of which is conspicuously absent from &quot; For Keeps &quot; ( though you can find it in her 1989 collection , &quot; Hooked &quot; ) . For the first time in her career she asked &quot; for the forbearance of readers for a dissenting view of a film that is widely regarded_as a masterpiece. &quot; There is no objective reason why Kael should feel ambivalent about casting a cold eye on Claude Lanzmann ' s documentary about the Nazi extermination camps , in which a relatively small amount of simple information is inflated into a numbingly repetitive nine hours . But it isn ' t length or boredom that troubled Kael . She is upset by a scene in &quot; Shoah &quot; in which Lanzmann interviews Polish peasants -- showing them to be every bit as anti-Semitic today as they were in the Nazi era . &quot; The heart of ( Lanzmann ' s ) obsession appears to be to show you that the Gentiles will do_it again to the Jews if they get the chance , &quot; wails Kael . &quot; When you come_out , you ' re likely to feel dazed , and confirmed in all your worst fears. &quot; Exactly . The anti-Semitism &quot; Shoah &quot; uncovers unnerved her to the core . But Kael , a writer who always prided herself on her ability to dig deeply into the meaning of her responses to films , found herself unable to go the extra mile and see what stood behind her revulsion to &quot; Shoah. &quot; For a critic whose misfires are as fascinating as her bull ' s-eyes , it ' s telling that Kael has chosen to reprint &quot; Raising Kane &quot; without any amendments or even acknowledgments of the controversy it engendered , while at_the_same_time expunging her &quot; Shoah &quot; review from the permanent record . Sometimes you ' ve just got_to take yourself seriously .</TEXT>
