   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS IN HUENEME TO STUDY SPILLS ; PETROLEUM : OFFICIALS MEET WITH A NONPROFIT COMPANY FORMED AFTER THE EXXON VALDEZ DISASTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As an environmentalist in Russia ' s most important oil region , scientist Vladimir P . Melnikov is trying , slowly , to reverse a long history of ecological destruction . * His first challenge is educating fellow environmentalists . His second is persuading oil_industry executives that change can occur , even in the face of a crippled economy . On Friday , Melnikov and nine other officials from western Siberia visited the Port of Hueneme as part of a crash course on the latest technology for cleaning_up major disasters at_sea . Accompanied by two interpreters , the delegation met with members of the Marine Spill Response Corp . -- a nonprofit company formed in the wake of the Exxon Valdez disaster . Aboard the center ' s $ 13-million California Responder ship , they inspected skimmer heads used for vacuuming oil from the ocean and rubber booms used to contain a floating slick . In a 90 # 000-square-foot warehouse , they peeked at rigid-hulled , inflatable boats used to place the booms and transport people and supplies . To the delegation , the quality of such equipment was impressive . But equally stunning was the fact that the corporation is a $ 1-billion joint_venture between giant oil_companies . During a question-and-answer session before the tour , the Russian ecologists -- many of whom head departments within regional governments -- asked about American regulations for reporting spills . &quot; You must understand , the law in the U.S. is that if you create the sheen of oil on the water , you must report it , &quot; said Lindon A . Onstad , regional manager for the center . Onstad also told the delegation that approximately 1 # 000 spills are reported in the U.S. each year . However , only about 5 % of those are big enough to require a full-scale cleanup effort . * In 1993 , he said , the nationwide Marine Spill Response Center tackled six spills , all_of which were larger than 1 # 200 barrels or too big for local agencies to handle . Melnikov , who heads the Tyumen Scientific Center , said ruptured pipelines and leaking reservoirs are responsible_for the majority of the disasters that have scarred the Western Siberian landscape . In some areas , vast stretches of land are covered by lakes of oil and oil-byproduct . Almost all_of the pipelines and drilling equipment are old and have deteriorated over time , he said . &quot; For many years . . . any attention at all to the environment was completely subordinate to the oil_industry , &quot; he said . Awareness of the environment is growing , he said , but it is overwhelmed by the need for greater oil_production to support the struggling economy . * &quot; Because of all_of this , &quot; Melnikov said , &quot; our environment is not changing at all . &quot; In order to make_up for lost time , we need vast financial resources , &quot; he added . The delegation was scheduled to leave Ventura County today for Alaska , where it will tour oil fields on the North Slope , visit an offshore_rig and meet with private environmental groups . The Russian delegation ' s trip is being funded through the U.S. Agency for International Development as part of a $ 2.5-billion economic aid program to the countries of the new Russian Federation . As part of the same program , a team of Americans visited western Siberia earlier this year . Their mission was similar to this week ' s visit : to bring western environmental technology to the Russian region .</TEXT>
