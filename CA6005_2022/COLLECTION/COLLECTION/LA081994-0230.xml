   <HEADLINE> STRONG SURGE IN TRADE UNDER NAFTA FOUND ; COMMERCE : POSITIVE FIGURES ARE CLOUDED BY A SHARP RISE IN THE IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN . U.S. EXPORTS FOR JUNE SET A RECORD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trade between the United States and Mexico continues its strong growth in the wake of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , with southbound products jumping by 17 % and northbound goods surging 19 % in the second quarter , according to figures released Thursday . Improved trade with Mexico helped push overall U.S. exports in June to a record $ 58.17 billion , a 3.6 % increase from May , bumping the nation ' s trade_deficit down 1.6 % to $ 9.37 billion . The rise was led by sales of aircraft and telecommunications and computer equipment . But the nation ' s nettlesome trade_deficit with Japan worsened again , shooting_up $ 1.13 billion to $ 5.52 billion in June , the U.S. Commerce_Department said . That was the biggest gap since March . The stepped-up traffic to Mexico was led by auto parts , telecommunications_equipment , plastics and other products , pushing U.S. exports to $ 12.6 billion over the three months ended June 30 . The 17 % increase from the comparable period in 1993 was similar to the first-quarter gain , evidence of the impact of the effects of the accord , which went_into effect Jan . 1 . Mexico ' s exports to the United States grew even faster in the latest quarter , totaling $ 12.05 billion , up 19 % . Mexico ' s exports were led by petroleum -- reflecting a rise in the price of crude_oil -- as well as autos and televisions . The trade agreement seeks to do_away_with all trade_barriers between the United States , Mexico and Canada over a 20-year period . And while producers of some products are complaining of snags and bureaucratic obstacles , there seems to be little doubt that NAFTA is stimulating trade . Trade between the United States and Canada also grew , by 10 % in each direction , according to Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown , who held a news_conference to tout the North_American trade figures . He called NAFTA &quot; a win-win-win situation . All three countries have benefited by NAFTA. &quot; The trade figures were the latest in a string of good economic news preceding Mexico ' s presidential election Sunday . The Mexican stock_market has surged over the last month and short-term interest_rates have fallen , signs of optimism that the elections will be orderly and that the Mexican economy will continue to open_up and modernize . Mexico ' s manufacturers are shipping more goods not only here but to the world , a strong sign that the country is_on the verge of major economic_growth if the elections go smoothly , said Josue Campos Campuzano , an economist at CIEMEX / WEFA , a Philadelphia think_tank specializing in Latin_America . NAFTA benefits are also being seen in U.S. border states where financial and legal services are gearing_up for a major post-election surge in trade , said Fiona Sigalla , an economist with the Federal_Reserve_Bank in Dallas . But U.S. producers of bulk commodities , plastics , heavy machinery and electronic_equipment are already benefiting from NAFTA . &quot; NAFTA is unfolding as we anticipated , &quot; said Michael Hissam , a General Motors spokesman based in the auto giant ' s El Paso regional office . &quot; In the first six months of 1994 , GM exported more_than 4 # 500 cars and trucks to Mexico . That compares to 350 during the same period of 1993. &quot; * Associated Press contributed to this report .
