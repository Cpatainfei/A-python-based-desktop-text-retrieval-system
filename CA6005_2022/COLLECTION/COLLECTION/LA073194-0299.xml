   <TEXT> From the moment Summit County public_defender Elliott Levine first heard about him , he sensed James Holland was going_to be a tough client to represent . After all , they ' d caught him in Bonifay , Fla. , guzzling beer while barreling 85 miles an hour down Interstate 10 , some 18 miles from the service_station where he ' d just pulled an armed robbery . In his car were a . 38-caliber pistol , 40 rounds of ammunition and a paper_bag filled with cash . Within hours , he ' d confessed to a string of armed_robberies and two murders , one in Utah , another in Idaho . Within days , he ' d arrived here at the Summit County Jail , extradited from Florida to face charges for the Utah murder . For a while , Levine nonetheless entertained hopes of forging a defense . Usually there ' s a twist to a client ' s brush with the law , an opening a good criminal defense_attorney can parlay into a deal , if not an acquittal . My guy confessed under duress ; my guy didn ' t get his Miranda rights ; my guy was beaten_up -- you could always argue something . Levine ' s hopes , however , quickly evaporated when he finally met Holland . &quot; Yeah , I did_it , I killed him , &quot; Holland said , sitting across from Levine in a Summit County Jail interview room . &quot; I talked to the sheriffs on the way up from Florida . Told them everything. &quot; Holland sounded polite , reasonable , relaxed . He was lanky , 5 feet , 11 inches , and 152 pounds , with long sideburns and several tattoos on his hands and arms . Levine asked questions , searching for a defense . Instead , he heard ominous hints of other , unsolved crimes . &quot; You really never know what ' s going_on with me , &quot; Holland said . Levine considered . Holland had spent 35 of his 47 years behind bars , including 22 for a second-degree murder committed in Iowa in 1964 . He ' d never managed to stay free for more_than a_few months . He ' d also never managed to express remorse . The Iowa state psychiatric reports , diagnosing a &quot; severe antisocial personality , &quot; had described him as &quot; a pathetic man who has been destructive to life and property . . . . Constantly defensive and sensitive of being regarded_as skinny and mild-mannered . . . . Quite uncivilized and unsocialized . . . . Unaccustomed to being treated like a human being. &quot; &quot; We have options , &quot; Levine said . &quot; We can file motions . We can get ACLU-type groups involved . You ' re facing the death penalty. &quot; &quot; Let ' s just get_it over with , &quot; Holland said . &quot; I did_it . I want to plead guilty . I don ' t want to fight . that ' s it. &quot; Levine liked to look_into people ' s eyes , but when he looked_into Holland ' s , he felt flat-out scared . They were the darkest he ' d ever seen . He means it , Levine realized . This is what my client wants . I ' m supposed to be a zealous adversary against the state , but I ' m also supposed to represent my client ' s interests . What to do ? So began Levine ' s fateful descent into the tangled ethical perplexities of criminal defense law . At a time when high-profile defense_attorneys seem willing to go_to any length to exonerate their clients , Levine has found himself obliged to ponder the boundaries and obligations of his profession . How far to go_for an obviously guilty and unremorseful client who does not wish to fight ? Which to serve , the client ' s desires or the state ' s demands ? Levine eventually decided he should , above all , honor his client ' s wishes . Levine eventually decided that an unfettered adversarial stance was not always best . Levine eventually decided to stand silent and rest_on the record when it came time to argue for Holland ' s life . In fact , there came a moment much later when Levine deemed it fair to say , in a written brief , that Holland was a &quot; prime candidate &quot; for the death_penalty . In response , the Utah legal_community has risen in dismay . In recent weeks , lawyers have denounced Levine in public comments , formal complaints and appellate motions . The Utah Supreme Court has removed him from Holland ' s and another murder case . The Utah State Bar has filed a formal complaint charging him with violations of rules concerning competence , diligence , misconduct and conflict_of_interest . Without a zealous adversary for the defense , Levine ' s critics fume , the system breaks_down . No matter what the defendant wants , the defense_lawyer must play his role . The defense_attorney must argue ; the defense_attorney must file motions ; the defense_attorney must fight for his client ' s life , if not his freedom . &quot; Levine is not doing what a criminal defense_attorney should do , &quot; declares an exasperated Loni Deland , past president of the Utah Assn . of Criminal Defense_Lawyers . Unmoved , Levine disagrees , and grows ever more defiant , even as he faces , at age 45 , his likely undoing as a lawyer . His is a doomed , utterly impractical , but not incomprehensible vision of a world where lawyers sometimes stop battling . &quot; I have , &quot; he says , &quot; a somewhat different viewpoint of the criminal defense_attorney ' s role. &quot; * It was not by accident that James Holland fell_into the arms of the law in Bonifay , Fla . By that Friday in July , 1987 , he ' d been trying_for some time to get caught . Traveling across the country , he ' d stand_in front of security cameras and wave while robbing convenience_stores . He ' d leave fingerprints all_over the place . He ' d speed along curving mountain roads and wide-open interstates . Finally , in Florida , he backed his car right up in front of a convenience_store window , so the girl inside could see his license_plates clearly . He laid his gun on the counter . He told the clerk to put the money in a sack and walk into the cooler . Then he roared up Interstate 10 with a beer in his hand . When Bonifay Police_Chief Joe Roberts pulled him over , Holland was as direct and unguarded as could be , and not just about the armed robbery . A year ago , he said , he killed a man in Utah whom he ' d met at an Idaho rest stop while hitchhiking along Interstate 84 . A few days ago , he killed another man at the same rest stop . In between them , he ' d committed a string of armed_robberies from California to Tennessee . Holland sounded relieved as he talked . He hated prison , but at least he knew how to live there . He didn ' t know how to live_on the outside . Three weeks later , Holland waived his Miranda rights and filled_in the details of the Utah murder for the Summit County sheriff ' s detective who ' d come_to Florida to fetch him . Four days after that , in the Summit County Jail , Holland again waived his rights , this time to describe the Idaho murder to the Oneida County , Ida. , sheriff . In each instance , the officers reported , Holland displayed no emotion or regret . &quot; He got what he deserved for calling me a bum , &quot; Holland said of the Idaho victim . By the time Elliott Levine met him , Holland had told his story to just about any officer of the law who happened to pass_through the Summit County sheriff ' s office . Levine soon found , however , that his client wasn ' t entirely indiscriminate with his confidences . Holland would not talk to doctors or psychologists . Nor would he take their tests . To Levine , the question of Holland ' s mental competence promised the best line_of_defense . But by refusing to talk to the doctors , Holland was preventing him from making that case . In fact , Holland would n ' t let him make any case . Instead , Holland talked to Levine for hours , looking_back at his past and forward to his future with equal melancholy . In prison , he said , he spends 23 hours a day alone in a 5-by-7-foot cell . He gets_out only one hour a day to walk_around a yard . No one writes or visits . No friends , no family , no one anywhere . Locked_up 35 years , he ' s never had a single letter . &quot; I don ' t want to spend the rest of my life in prison , &quot; Holland told Levine . &quot; Let ' s get_it over with . I ' m not getting_out , so I might as well die. &quot; Holland was right , Levine thought . He wasn ' t ever going_to get_out . He was a career criminal , unable to function in society . This was what you got when you kept someone behind bars for most of his life . What did he owe the client ? Levine wondered . What did he owe the system ? These were questions Levine had never faced before . A peripatetic background -- a year on a Chevrolet assembly_line , law_school at the University of Mississippi , years of meandering from one small-time law_firm to another -- had taken Levine from Michigan to Utah , but it had never exposed him to someone like James Holland . At midlife Levine had a wife , a graying beard , a balding dome and no certain answers . He would , he realized , have to grope_for the proper course . Later , some of Levine ' s critics would suggest his difficulties stemmed mainly from his lack of experience or accomplishment in the field of criminal_law , particularly death_penalty cases . Levine was public_defender in Summit County , they would point_out , only because he offered the lowest bid for the county ' s contract . Hiring the lowest bidder was many_a rural county ' s way of saving money in Utah . Before this , Levine was doing mainly divorces , collections , bankruptcies . What do you expect to get for a $ 14 # 000-a-year retainer ? &quot; Levine lacks the time , the talent , the experience , &quot; said Loni Deland of the criminal defense_lawyers ' association . &quot; He never was a criminal defense_attorney in the first place . The only way he can call himself that is because he was lowest bidder. &quot; There may be some truth in such comments , even after discounting for the obvious animosity against an out-of-county attorney who stole business by lowballing the locals -- an attorney who some in Summit County refer to privately as &quot; a short , funny little guy. &quot; The fact is , even above-average public_defenders can ' t serve clients nearly as well as do highly paid private attorneys , and nothing in Levine ' s legal background suggests he is above average . All the same , some of those most concerned about the underfunding of Utah public_defenders say the core of the Levine brouhaha involves something other_than that issue . Levine agrees . He has enough time , resources and experience to do his job , he argues . If not overly distinguished , his legal training at the University of Mississippi and his legal practice for small firms in Michigan and Utah have seasoned him well enough . What his background has not done , he feels , is convince him to go_around saying to clients , &quot; I ' m going_to get you off. &quot; That just isn ' t always possible , he believes , or even desirable . To Deland , pleading guilty to first-degree murder without a deal for leniency in sentencing was the definition of incompetence . To Levine , a plea bargain in Holland ' s case looked utterly impossible . It was a little difficult , after all , to bargain when your client was regularly making_it clear to his jailers that he wanted to &quot; get_it over with. &quot; In other circumstances , a defense_attorney might be able to negotiate down to manslaughter or second-degree murder . But Utah had a newly adopted statute that essentially raised a second-degree murder to a capital crime , punishable by death , if the accused had a prior conviction for murder or a violent felony . We can go_to trial , Levine advised his client . We have nothing to lose . No , Holland said . To Levine , Holland seemed not so_much to have a death wish as an inclination to accept what was coming . It was sort of like having a patient in a hospital say he wanted no life support . Levine wasn ' t inclined to abandon Holland . But he also wasn ' t inclined to ignore his client ' s wishes . On Aug . 18 , 1987 , 19 days after arriving in Utah , Holland pleaded guilty to the murder of Sam Patt and asked_for an expedited penalty hearing before a judge , not a jury . When that hearing began at 10:20 a.m. on Sept . 17 in the Summit County_courthouse , it soon became clear just how adamant Holland was about &quot; getting_it over with. &quot; Levine began by asking_for a continuance . In the week before the hearing , Holland had finally , grudgingly , agreed to talk to clinical_psychologist Michael D . Decaria . But the two had only met twice , for a total of 3 1 / 2 hours , the second exchange occurring just the day before . Holland had refused to take any psychological tests . Decaria wanted more time , particularly to explore information he ' d just received about Holland ' s childhood . The prosecution did not object , nor did the judge . Only Holland objected . &quot; I want to go_on today , now , be done with it , &quot; he told the court . &quot; I don ' t want to talk with ( Decaria ) no more , period . I want it to go today. &quot; When Levine began to object , Holland rose , told the jail guards , &quot; Let ' s get_out of here , &quot; and marched in shackles toward the courtroom doors . Extended pleading and explanation could not sway Holland : &quot; My desire is to just go_ahead and get_it over with and do_it now and be done with it . Two or three weeks or a month is not going_to make any difference at all . It is still going_to be the same outcome . . . . Let them go_ahead and do what they have got_to do. &quot; Levine clearly felt torn by two obligations . &quot; When I came_to court today , &quot; he told the judge , &quot; I was put_in this quandary between what Dr. Decaria was telling me and what Mr. Holland is telling me , and I don ' t want Mr. Holland to think that I am going_against him or undercutting him in any way . . . . All I am saying is that I determined it is in his best interest . . . that we be allowed the additional time . . . . I would certainly hope that Mr. Holland would realize that I am still working for him . . . . &quot; When Holland would n ' t bend after several recesses , Levine finally decided to honor his client ' s wishes . &quot; It is Mr. Holland ' s desire -- it is at his insistence that we go_forward with the hearing today . . . &quot; he told the court . &quot; I would say definitely I have advised him fully of all_the consequences . . . . Mr. Holland still desires to go_ahead . . . . Based upon that , I will stand_by Mr. Holland. &quot; Called as a witness , guided by Levine , Holland for much of that afternoon retold the life_story he ' d already shared_in private hours with his attorney . In some ways the litany was regrettably familiar , beginning with an abusive , alcoholic father who disappeared when Holland was 6 . But as the details accumulated , Holland ' s tale grew increasingly singular . He ' d been sad and alone , Holland said , ever since his mother died when he was 8 . One night after he went_to_bed , someone woke him and told him his mom was dead . An auto accident . It felt to Holland like putting your finger in a light socket . After that , his brother and two sisters were sent to one aunt and uncle ' s home , he alone to another . His aunt and uncle beat and scorned him . Every chance he got , he ' d run_off , trying to find his siblings , trying to escape the ridicule . When he was 9 , his aunt and uncle put him in a reformatory , where he stayed until 17 . From the reform_school he went straight to a penitentiary , punishment for trying to escape . After he got_out a year later , he met two boys while hitchhiking . They had pistols and the notion to rob a filling station . Holland joined them , netting $ 61 . For that , he spent five years in the Florida state_prison at Raiford . When he got_out at age 24 , in 1964 , he started hitchhiking again . One early July day that year , a fellow giving him a ride in Iowa suddenly pulled_off the road into the woods near a river , stripped naked and insisted that Holland join him in a swim . When Holland declined , the fellow grabbed him by the shirt . Holland tripped , fell , pulled_out a gun and shot five times at the man standing over him . He could have gotten_away with it , Holland explained , but when he soon after was caught for a robbery in Elgin , Tenn. , he confessed . &quot; It must have been just self-punishment , &quot; Holland said . &quot; It was kind of weighing_on me , and I just wanted to get_it over with. &quot; This time he went_to prison for 22 years for second-degree murder . When he was released on Dec . 17 , 1985 , he felt lost . He had nobody to talk to , no sense of what to do . Get_on the road , was all he could figure . He tended bar and chopped wood in Tennessee , picked cherries in California , then wandered back through Utah , confused . He couldn ' t relate to people ; he couldn ' t deal with them . The world felt pretty crazy to him . Rolling down the interstates , he sometimes pulled to the side to drink whiskey and cry . Other times , he ' d drive for hours , then turn_around and drive the other way . In one month alone he covered 23 # 000 miles -- up_to 1 # 000 miles a day . Six and a half months after his release from prison , Holland met Sam Patt at the Juniper rest area off Interstate 84 in Idaho . Patt was 72 , an itinerant fruit-picker from Florida . Patt asked Holland where he was going and whether he had a driver ' s license . Would you mind driving if I give you a ride ? Patt wondered . They started south down Interstate 84 , stopping in Ogden for gas , where Patt took_over the driving . Past Ogden , the region grew dark and cold and remote . Patt suddenly braked , right on the interstate , and ordered Holland out of the car . Holland didn ' t want to get_out . Holland drew a . 32-caliber pistol from his waistband and laid it on his left leg . If anyone ' s getting_out of the car , it will be you , he said . Patt reached for the gun with one hand , and clawed at Holland ' s face with the other . They struggled . Holland pulled the trigger five times , then dragged Patt ' s body from the car and drove_off . After that , he traveled_to Tucson , then back to Tennessee , then to Texas , where he worked_on an offshore oil_rig for a while and later stayed with his brother . When his brother ' s criticisms started riling him , he left , scared of himself , scared he ' d hurt his brother . He was aware , by now , that summers made him feel particularly irritable , restless , depressed ; in summers he slept only an hour or two at a time . The summer after killing Patt -- in fact , precisely one year to the day after killing Patt -- he pulled again into the Juniper rest area . For two hours there he vainly tried to sell a hunting_knife for gas money . He approached Karl Behm , a 24-year-old from Ohio , who snarled something to him like , &quot; Get_away , bum. &quot; This offended Holland , for he had just as nice a car and clothes as Behm . Holland knew instantly he was going_to kill Behm . The more he thought_about it , sitting on a rest stop bench , the madder he grew . He decided he was going_to kill everybody in the rest area . On his way to get the gun from his car , though , a lady with two children pulled into the rest stop . Holland couldn ' t hurt a lady or children , so he waited until they left . By then only a truck_driver and Behm were still there . Holland was approaching the truck when the truck_driver happened to pull_away . That left Behm . Holland walked over to Behm ' s car and shot him through the window as he lay asleep in the front seat . He dragged Behm ' s body across the sidewalk into the junipers , took his wallet and drove_off . Six days later , he pulled the armed robbery in Bonifay , Fla. , that finally brought him back to the relief of prison life . &quot; that ' s why I went_ahead and confessed to this murder here , I guess , just to ensure that I was in_for good , &quot; Holland said . &quot; It just kind of lifted a load off of you . . . . I didn ' t want to hurt anybody else . . . . I go_off the deep end sometimes. &quot; Holland shrugged when asked about the choice between life in prison and the death_penalty . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; he said . &quot; I am going_to die in prison sooner or later anyhow . If I get the death_penalty , I will just die a little sooner is all. &quot; He could make no promises about avoiding violence in prison . &quot; I couldn ' t say what I would do because I never know what I am going_to do from one minute to the next. &quot; Perhaps because Decaria was known as a professional defense witness , who was flatly opposed to the death_penalty , it apparently mattered little to Judge Homer F . Wilkinson when the psychologist minutes later testified that Holland ' s &quot; extreme depression &quot; and great longing for &quot; relief &quot; rendered him incompetent to enter a plea . After digesting the_matter for two weeks , the judge announced Holland ' s sentence . &quot; Judge Grants Wish of Summit Killer , &quot; declared the local Salt Lake Tribune headline that day . * Much passion colors arguments in the legal_community about just how far a criminal defense_attorney should go_with a client such_as James Holland . To many , the issue reaches well beyond a concern for the defendant ' s Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel . To many , the need for a zealous adversary in the criminal defense_attorney ' s chair arises even more out of concern for the workings of the legal_system , and all_of society . Whatever the desire of an individual defendant , argues a host of scholars , jurists and lawyers , the integrity of the law as an institution must be sustained . At stake is the Eighth Amendment ' s proscription against arbitrary and capricious punishment . If the defense_attorney does not fill his role as adversary , if the defense_attorney is seeking the same goal as the prosecution , the system just doesn ' t work . The defendant and his attorney must fight , even if they don ' t want to . The state ' s interest in a just society takes precedence over a defendant ' s autonomy . The state ' s interest , adds Utah ' s Chief_Justice Michael Zimmerman , also takes precedence over public sentiment . The public probably identifies with Levine , Zimmerman observed recently , talking in his chambers , &quot; because it doesn ' t like the sense of lawyers as amoral hired guns and because it sees the system thrashing endlessly on people who are clearly guilty . . . . There is a great gap between the public ' s sympathy for Levine and the legal_community ' s horror . People don ' t understand the adversary role , particularly in criminal cases . Where the might of the state comes against an individual , then a lawyer ' s duty must be unalloyed to his client . It is a political model , not a legal one . The public doesn ' t acknowledge this , but the defendant is surrogate for you and me . That is why the system has to put a check on the state. &quot; No doubt that is also why , after James Holland ' s conviction , the Utah Supreme Court_ordered Levine to file an automatic appeal and remained unmoved when Holland objected in a personal_letter to the court . &quot; I comprehend your statement that you have not authorized an appeal , &quot; Geoffrey Butler , clerk of the Supreme Court , wrote back to Holland . &quot; But your court-appointed attorney , Mr. Elliott Levine , really has no choice . The Supreme Court has instructed Mr. Levine to . . . prepare the review . . . . This explains why Mr. Levine is proceeding without your expressed consent. &quot; As it turned_out , the Supreme Court wasn ' t impressed with Levine ' s appeal , which centered chiefly on the issue of competence . From the record , the justices said , it was clear the defendant was competent to assist in his defense and &quot; fully knew and understood &quot; what was going_on . Nevertheless , the justices sent the case back for a second penalty hearing , saying the trial_judge had not followed proper procedure in reaching his sentencing decision . The second time around , doctors of all sorts managed to gain at least some exposure to Holland , although he still usually refused to take their tests . In Idaho ( where Holland was sent briefly to plead guilty to first-degree murder and draw a life sentence ) , a state clinical_psychologist found him polite , calm , rational , stable , in control , with no convincing evidence of mental_illness -- and no remorse . What he was , the psychologist concluded , was an &quot; extremely dangerous individual &quot; with a &quot; severe antisocial personality_disorder &quot; and a &quot; very poor &quot; prognosis for improvement or rehabilitation . The Utah doctors did not disagree . Halfway through their evaluation , Utah State Hospital medical administrators urgently asked that Holland be transferred back to prison because they believed he presented &quot; an extreme danger to the hospital. &quot; Members of the staff , they explained , were utterly frightened of this patient . All the same , Dr. George J . W . Smith , the acting hospital clinical director , felt moved to add some unusually personal notes to his evaluation . &quot; During the interview the patient over-related to me much as the symbiotic child does . . . &quot; he wrote . &quot; I found myself developing a loving feeling for him . . . . I could have cried_for him , as he did for himself , as he described the accidental death of his mother , her funeral and how he can still see her in her casket and frequently talks to her as if she were present. &quot; Holland described his mother ' s death and loss , Smith wrote , &quot; as some people describe religious experiences . . . . He felt as if a severe electrical_shock had gone_through him , which he has continued to experience to the present_time and which appears to be always connected to killing or wanting to kill . It is almost orgastic in nature , following which he feels much relaxed and sometimes falls_asleep . He is really quite frightened of_his_own impulses , begging for help and not understanding what it is that comes_over him. &quot; And yet , Smith added , as soon as Holland left this revealing interview with him , he became &quot; an entirely different person with an entirely different tone_of_voice . . . . As we walked among other patients , he became tense and hostile , speaking in a much higher_pitch and rapid form of speech . He said , ' I don ' t hate any individual ; I don ' t want to kill anybody specifically ; I just hate society in_general and want to do something about it ! ' &quot; It did not escape Smith ' s attention that Holland had committed all three of his murders in early July and thus might have a manic-depressive disorder affected by changes in season or light . Smith looked_at his calender with some alarm . It was June 1 , 1990 . &quot; This patient must be placed in a more secure environment just as soon as possible , &quot; he wrote to Judge Wilkinson . &quot; As we near the beginning of July , his potentiality for dangerousness becomes ever increasingly greater ! &quot; Since Smith and a court-appointed clinical_psychologist thought Holland not competent to stand trial , Levine filed a motion to set_aside Holland ' s guilty plea . Wilkinson refused , instead ordering psychiatric treatment for Holland while he sat in the Summit County Jail , awaiting a second penalty hearing . This treatment , from Dr. Breck Lebegue , director of the Forensic Psychiatry Service at the University of Utah , would provide at once medical succor for Holland and a legal impasse for Levine . Over a period of six weeks , Lebegue reported in a letter to the judge on Jan . 14 , 1991 , Holland has responded dramatically to heavy daily doses of lithium_carbonate and Sinequan . Holland ' s irritability , hostility , hopelessness , insomnia and anxiety have decreased significantly , and his capacity for rational thought has sharpened considerably . He has &quot; responded to the fullest extent possible to medication treatment. &quot; The transformation , however , had done nothing to change Holland ' s mind about his fate . &quot; Presently , he still wishes to die , &quot; Lebegue reported . &quot; But this is not a symptom of nor the product of his psychiatric disease . . . . Rather , his desire to die is an existential choice based on the significant misery he has experienced in life , and on a preference for death as punishment for his crime , rather than life imprisonment . He is quite familiar_with the circumstances of imprisonment , and does not choose to continue to exist under those circumstances . . . . My knowledge of Mr. Holland is derived from many interviews . . . . Mr. Holland ' s mental_state is presently as calm and non-depressed as I have ever seen him . . . . His decision is not the result of depressive suicidal hopelessness , but rather a rational decision to accept the sentence of the court. &quot; Needless to say , Lebegue ' s judgment substantively reduced Levine ' s chance of putting_on an effective defense . Other doctors might be regarded by the judge as hired guns with axes to grind , but Lebegue was a highly respected , board-certified specialist in forensic psychiatry . When the second penalty hearing began in Coalville one month later , on the morning of Feb . 14 , 1991 , the Summit County prosecutor simply entered Dr. Lebegue ' s letter into evidence , then rested his case . Levine in response tried briefly to mention Holland ' s bad physical reaction to medication two weeks before , involving episodes of shaking , but Holland stopped him . &quot; Mr. Levine . . . &quot; Holland interrupted . &quot; I ' m the only person that knows what happened , so how can you outline it ? Just drop it . . . . I am as competent as anybody in this room . . . . My hands still shake . But there isn ' t nothing shaky about my mind . . . . I want to get_it over and done with. &quot; Levine now stood at the edge of a nebulous legal wilderness . He could not look_to Utah for exact precedents . The closest model came_in California , where the state Supreme Court in 1985 held that an attorney who acquiesced to his client ' s request not to present mitigating evidence failed to effectively represent the client . But more recent California decisions , noting the defense_attorney ' s &quot; unenviable and wrenching choice &quot; and &quot; paramount duty of loyalty to the client , &quot; have explicitly rejected the notion that defense counsel should be forced to present mitigating evidence over a client ' s objections . Instead , in California and elsewhere , judges on occasion have appointed a third_party to investigate and offer mitigating evidence once the defense counsel rises to say his client declines to do so . Even here , though , there is dispute . To require a defense_attorney to rise in this manner , some argue , is to require him to acknowledge that mitigating evidence exists . The defendant , through the mouth of his attorney , is in this way being required by the state to say what he does not want to say . Who ' s in_charge ? Levine wondered . Was he merely a puppet in the state court system , an actor reading a script ? Can the system always require him to push_back when the defendant doesn ' t want to push_back ? Can they orchestrate the whole_thing , write the script , and call you unethical if you don ' t follow it ? Must he play the game as the courts want ? Levine thought_about Holland ' s abiding sadness . Maybe there was more comfort for Holland on the other side . Who knows ? Levine ' s critics would later wonder how a lawyer could decide that his client should die . How can you not argue mitigating evidence ? What of the doctors who thought Holland had suffered for years from an untreated manic-depressive illness -- wasn ' t that worth pursuing ? Even if your client is competent and responsible , even if you don ' t want to defy him , how can you side with the state ? You should instead withdraw ; you should instead just refuse to represent him . Standing_in the Summit County courtroom at Holland ' s second penalty hearing , Levine saw matters differently . Wilkinson had heard all_the evidence the first time around and now had the transcript of that session , along with the current medical_reports . Levine felt he ' d said all he could . How many motions do you file , how many objections do you raise ? People always complain that the legal_system drags_on , especially in death_penalty cases , because defense_attorneys just never stop . Levine more or less agreed . Arguing that your client ' s mama ruined his synapses by giving him too_much cocoa when he was a baby -- that went too far . It seemed to Levine that defense_attorneys sometimes let their egos and ambitions get_the_best of them . It seemed to Levine that defense_attorneys sometimes ignored ethical boundaries in their drive to win at all costs . If he withdrew , who would represent Holland ; who would honor his wishes ? He had to defer to Holland . &quot; As I said initially . . . it ' s Mr. Holland ' s desire to submit the_matter to the court based upon the transcripts . . . &quot; Levine finally told the court . &quot; As far as our obligation to point_out to the court any mitigating_circumstances , I feel that the transcript from the last sentencing contains exactly the same information that I would . . . present to the court today . . . . &quot; Not even the prosecutor ' s incomplete account of the murder -- he failed to mention that Holland shot Patt only after the victim grabbed for and struggled over a gun -- altered Levine ' s course . &quot; Your honor , I waive any response , &quot; he said when the prosecutor finished his closing argument . Wilkinson needed no time to contemplate his decision . &quot; The court does . . . impose the death_penalty upon the defendant , &quot; he announced when the lawyers had finished . &quot; The penalty should be carried_out by a firing_squad or the administering of lethal intravenous_injection , that being at the option of the defendant . Mr. Levine , is Mr. Holland prepared to make a selection ? &quot; &quot; It don ' t make no difference , &quot; Holland answered_for himself . &quot; It doesn ' t make any difference to me which way I go . I ' ll leave that up_to the court. &quot; NEXT : Levine pleads another murderer guilty .</TEXT>
