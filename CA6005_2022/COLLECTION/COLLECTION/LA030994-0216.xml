   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN ' S FOES NOT LEANING TOWARD VIOLENCE , NIXON SAYS ; RUSSIA : EX-PRESIDENT SEES NO STRUGGLE FOR A RETURN TO COMMUNISM . BUT HE HAS YET TO MEET RADICAL ZHIRINOVSKY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former President Richard Nixon , on a weeklong visit to Russia that includes extensive meetings with opposition leaders , said Tuesday that he is heartened that none of them appear to seek violence or a return to the old Soviet Communist regime . &quot; I find that they ' re unanimous in believing that the country is_on the wrong course , &quot; Nixon said of anti-government critics ranging from the ousted vice_president to the head of the Communist_Party . &quot; But what encouraged me is that I have not found any of the opposition leaders today . . . who want to change the situation by force or any of them who want to go_back to what the situation was before the new Russian Revolution. &quot; Nixon , a strong advocate of U.S. support for the Kremlin ' s reforms , has yet to meet with the most intimidating leader of the Russian opposition -- ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who emerged the favorite of fed-up voters in December elections . That meeting may occur today , Zhirinovsky ' s spokesmen and Nixon ' s chief_of_staff said . But Nixon also may decide that it is more politically correct to meet with Zhirinovsky only after he meets with President Boris N . Yeltsin . Both President Clinton and Vice_President Al Gore have pointedly spurned Zhirinovsky on recent visits to Moscow , refusing to add_to his legitimacy by meeting him . He was the only opposition leader not to be invited to a special reception for Clinton at the U.S. ambassador ' s luxurious residence , Spaso House . But Nixon ' s visit appears to provide Clinton with an unofficial channel to Zhirinovsky . Nixon told reporters that he talked to Clinton by phone before his departure and will deliver an assessment of what he found here upon his return . What he has found so far , Nixon told reporters , is that &quot; there is no question that the country is in trouble. &quot; But , he said , he took it as a sign of Yeltsin ' s strength that the Russian government made no attempt to keep him from meeting with its opponents . &quot; The fact that they did not resist that , I think , is a positive indication , &quot; Nixon said after a meeting with Gennady A . Zyuganov , head of Russia ' s Communist_Party . Nixon , 81 , is also to meet today with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , and he is tentatively scheduled to meet with Yeltsin next Monday in the resort town of Sochi if the Russian president goes_ahead with plans for a brief vacation there . Nixon has visited Moscow nine times . But this trip comes at an unusually sensitive time , in the wake of a noticeable cooling in U.S.-Russian relations . This cooling stems partly from Moscow ' s determination to reassert itself internationally and to play_up to rising nationalism at_home . The new Russian line , combined with the recent scandal surrounding the CIA counterintelligence chief who was caught spying for Moscow , has caused Washington to re-evaluate its Russia policy amid mounting questions about whether the United States should continue to supply Russia with aid . Clinton said Monday that he is concerned about Russia and the wave of nationalist extremism that &quot; would make more difficult our future relationships with them. &quot; Nixon appears to be trying to counteract the negative cycle in the making . He has used his status of senior statesman over the last two years to push for an array of U.S. aid for Russia , from food to a corps of managers to debt rescheduling . If America fails to cough_up , he has warned , its leaders soon will face the embarrassing question &quot; Who lost Russia ? &quot; He has argued that Russia ' s fate will determine the next 50 years of world history and that the world must prevent &quot; a new , more dangerous despotism based on extremist Russian nationalism &quot; from replacing communism . Zyuganov , after meeting with Nixon , said the message he sent to Clinton was that Yeltsin ' s economic reforms , if not modified , will &quot; not only totally destabilize the situation in Russia but will also bring_about a cataclysm of world dimensions. &quot; Zyuganov also emphasized that Yeltsin ' s strongest backers , the Russia ' s Choice bloc , got only about 15 % of the vote_in the December elections and that the United States should not orient its policy toward politicians with such weak support . Nixon is an ardent Yeltsin backer , but his agenda this trip shows that he shares the Administration ' s strategy of seeking wide-ranging contacts across the Russian political spectrum .</TEXT>
