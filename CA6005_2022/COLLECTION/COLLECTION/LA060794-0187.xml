   <HEADLINE> HOPES RISE FOR TRIBE THAT HAS NO RESERVATION ; NATIVE_AMERICANS : FEDERAL ACTIONS MAY HELP THE TIMBISHA SHOSHONE ESTABLISH A LAND BASE AT DEATH_VALLEY . ONLY 40 TO 60 MEMBERS NOW LIVE IN A BLEAK SETTLEMENT THERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For decades , the Timbisha Shoshone lived_in fear of losing their historic homeland here . One of the few federally recognized Native_American tribes without a land base , the Timbisha were moved to a settlement near Furnace Creek in the mid-1930s by the National_Park_Service . They say the park service deliberately made life miserable for them , hoping they would move away . &quot; They wanted to get_rid_of us and they thought if they put us here we would all pull_out , but we ' re not going_to pull_out , &quot; said tribal council_member Grace Goad , 66 . &quot; This is our home from way back. &quot; Now , the Timbisha are hopeful that their fortunes might soon change . The U.S. Senate recently passed an amendment to its version of the California Desert Protection Act providing_for a one-year study period to identify suitable lands for a Timbisha Shoshone reservation . Efforts are under way to add a similar amendment to the House version of the bill . The Timbisha were also recently awarded a federal grant to be used to begin identifying and acquiring a permanent land base and protecting longstanding cultural and natural_resources . The tribe insists that the reservation be inside the borders of Death_Valley National_Monument . Having their own reservation would allow them land for houses and economic development and make them eligible for federal grants and programs awarded only to tribes with a land base . After years of attempting to achieve federal recognition as a tribe , the Timbisha -- whose name refers to a reddish rock found in the mountains just east of the valley -- finally gained that status in 1983 . Their aboriginal homeland lies mostly within the proposed boundaries of Death_Valley National_Park as described in the desert bill . Most of the tribe ' s 276 members live outside the Death_Valley area . Between 40 and 60 Timbisha people remain here in the 60-acre village , a bleak settlement consisting_of several adobe_houses and a_few mobile_homes . For decades , luxury rooms at the exclusive Furnace Creek Inn resort have looked_out_over the Timbisha village less than two miles away . The village lies_in the path of sand blowing in from nearby dunes . The sand seeps into the houses through door and window openings and even electrical outlets , and kills plants and lawns , leaving much of the area barren . About a dozen adobe_houses were built for the Timbisha decades ago . Plumbing and electricity were installed just eight years ago , through a Department of Housing and Urban Development grant . Before that , tribe members said , they used outhouses , kerosene_lamps and wood stoves . During one period , the park service brought_in fire_hoses to demolish the adobe_houses after the occupants died . Seven of the houses were destroyed . &quot; Those that live there live at the whim of the National_Park_Service , &quot; said the tribe ' s attorney , Frederick Marr of California Indian Legal Services . &quot; The park service has rules , regulations and restrictions , so the tribe cannot practice its religion . . . . They can ' t gather firewood without special permission . If they have bugs in their house , they have to get special permission from the park service to use Raid . They ' re totally restricted. &quot; Tribe members also have complained about foul smells wafting toward their homes from sewer ponds for tourist facilities near the Timbisha village . The current park service administration in Death_Valley acknowledges that the Timbisha were mistreated by previous administrations . &quot; They may have some valid complaints , &quot; said Linda Greene , a Death_Valley National_Monument cultural resources manager . &quot; Certainly things were done and said that would not be done and said today , but we try to look_at that as past history in working_out a cooperative arrangement today . But a lot of those resentments are pretty strongly held. &quot; Although the Timbisha acknowledge that relations between the park service and the tribe have improved , a residue of resentment and mistrust keeps the relationship strained . Disputes continue to arise , most recently over the removal of Shoshone artifacts . Park visitors can be prosecuted for picking_up objects such_as pieces of basketry or arrowheads , but the tribe complains that the park service itself gathers artifacts without consulting them and stores them in the Death_Valley Museum . &quot; The problem is we can ' t leave them on site once they ' ve been discovered , because people walk away with them , &quot; Greene said . &quot; People have been looting all_over the monument. &quot; Death_Valley National_Monument Supt . Ed Rothfuss said the park service favors the establishment of a two-year study period to find suitable lands for a Timbisha reservation , which could be either inside the proposed national_park , entirely outside or some combination . But Rothfuss said park officials have some concerns about how the Timbisha would develop their land . &quot; The National_Park_Service would want some assurance that those uses to which the tribe may put those lands would be compatible with the purposes and the spirit of a national_park , &quot; he said . &quot; For example , things like developing a motel , restaurants , or gift_shops would be acceptable . Activities like high-rise apartments or a car dealership would not be compatible . . . . A gaming casino would be a totally incompatible concept. &quot; The Timbisha have said they would only build houses and facilities such_as a store , gas_station and curio shop . Referring to their their quest_for a reservation , Goad said , &quot; I hope this works , because we want houses . Then a lot of our tribe will come back. &quot;</TEXT>
