   <TEXT> The Menendez brothers have said they are broke . It turns_out they are right . Initially valued at $ 14.5 million , the Menendez family estate has almost entirely been run_through , according to recently unsealed probate records that explain how the millions were lost to taxes , legal_fees , inflated real_estate appraisals and even bad karma . All that technically remains of an estate that boasted of prime Beverly Hills real_estate and millions of dollars in entertainment_industry stocks is one house in Calabasas , a condominium in New Jersey , some jewelry , a_few pieces_of_furniture and $ 651 # 948 in cash , the probate files show . Nearly $ 10.8 million has already been spent , the records reveal , about half of that in taxes and lawyers ' fees for the defense of sons Lyle and Erik Menendez , who admit that they killed parents Jose and Kitty Menendez . What ' s left , after figuring in millions in losses on the sale of real_estate and stocks , is simply not enough to pay a mountain of debts that grows higher each day as interest accrues . &quot; The money goes , &quot; said one attorney familiar_with the files . &quot; It just goes. &quot; So_much of it is gone , according to the files , that even if Lyle and Erik Menendez were to be acquitted of murder in the Aug . 20 , 1989 , shotgun slayings of their parents , they would stand to inherit nothing -- a remarkable turn of events for a case in which prosecutors have long contended that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed . At their first trial , the brothers asserted that money had nothing to do with it . They testified that they killed in fear and self-defense after years of physical , emotional and sexual abuse . That first trial ended in January when separate juries , one for each brother , deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges . Prosecutors immediately vowed to try the brothers on murder_charges , and again to seek the death_penalty . No date has yet been set for the retrial . But in anticipation of the second trial , and after reviewing the probate files , a judge assigned two public_defenders to take_over Lyle Menendez ' s case . Attorney Jill Lansing left the case to spend more time with a young daughter . Defense_lawyer Leslie Abramson , who represents younger brother Erik Menendez , wants to stay_on for the retrial . She is_due to appear Tuesday at a Los Angeles Superior_Court hearing to renew her request to be paid $ 100 per hour , up_to $ 250 # 000 , in taxpayer money . Abramson has justified her request by saying that the brothers are out of money . The probate files back_up that assertion . * When he was killed , Jose Menendez was the highly paid chief_executive_officer of Live Entertainment , a Van Nuys-based video distribution firm and a subsidiary of Carolco Pictures , the movie production company . If he had lived , he stood to make a bonus of $ 850 # 000 for 1989 alone , the probate files reveal . Under California law , all his property was split equally with his wife . Under their wills , their sole heirs were their sons . The estate was first thought to be worth $ 14 # 501 , 342 , according to a probate document filed Aug . 22 , 1990 . That , though , left_out $ 164 in savings bonds , $ 30 # 470 in jewelry and $ 28 # 044 in furniture , clothes and personal things that had been overlooked . The added $ 58 # 678 brought the original total to $ 14 # 560 , 020 , according to a Nov . 26 , 1990 , probate filing . In large measure , according to the court records , the estate was made_up of three assets : a mansion in Beverly Hills appraised at $ 4.8 million , the house in Calabasas appraised at $ 2.65 million and 330 # 000 shares of stock in Live Entertainment appraised at $ 6.58 million . The remainder included items such_as the jewelry , the furniture and oddities such_as 16 French_francs said to be worth $ 2.46. For accounting purposes , the probate files also include in the asset column some $ 1.3 million in income generated from 1989 through April 30 , 1993 , the date on which the executors submitted the balance books . No updates have been filed since . The files also add in gains on stock sales during those four years , bringing the value on the books to a grand total of $ 16 # 018 , 906 . It is that figure -- not the $ 14.5 million estimated in the estate at the time of the killings -- from which the calculating is actually done . The estate has paid $ 3 # 906 , 280 in taxes , most of it in estate_taxes . To defend Lyle Menendez , it spent $ 740 # 000 . That sum was divided among attorneys Gerald Chaleff , Joel Isaacson and Lansing . To defend Erik Menendez , it spent $ 755 # 000 . Abramson earned $ 740 # 000 ; Robert Shapiro , the younger brother ' s first attorney , earned $ 15 # 000 . Total in criminal defense fees : $ 1 # 495 , 000 . The estate spent $ 2 # 743 , 219 on the Beverly Hills house and $ 1 # 404 , 007 on the Calabasas site , mostly for mortgages and upkeep . The estate allocated $ 314 # 384 for &quot; Lyle ' s miscellaneous expenses. &quot; Of that , $ 300 # 000 went_for the purchase of a New Jersey chicken-wing restaurant , said an attorney familiar_with the file . It also spent $ 9 # 392 on &quot; Erik ' s miscellaneous expenses. &quot; Included were medical_expenses , a pre-arrest plane_ticket and phone_bills . A variety of other fees and expenses brings the total spent to $ 10 # 771 , 199 . To calculate the value of what remains , the executors -- one of Jose Menendez ' s sisters and her husband -- factored in losses on sales of the Beverly Hills house and the Live Entertainment stock . * The house turned_out to be worth nowhere near $ 4.8 million . It was there , in the TV_room , that the sons killed the parents , and &quot; it was widely believed by the home-buying public and the real_estate_brokers and agents that this house had bad ' karma , ' and was one to be avoided , &quot; according to court records filed on behalf of lawyers for the executors . In 1991 , it sold for $ 3 # 607 , 975 -- a loss of $ 1 # 192 , 024 . What was left after meeting the mortgage and closing costs went directly to the Internal Revenue Service , attorneys said . The 330 # 000 shares of Live Entertainment stock proved difficult to unload , because the share price tumbled after the killings , the probate files indicate . The shares sold at_a_loss of $ 530 # 981 . * The estate recorded other losses on the sale of some furniture with the Beverly Hills house and on Carolco debentures . Total losses amounted to $ 1 # 806 , 577 . Subtracting the expenditures and the losses from the $ 16 # 018 , 906 working figure leaves $ 3 # 441 , 130 as the total of the inventory in the estate . But that figure is misleading , because it lists the Calabasas house at its 1990 appraised value , $ 2.65 million . It was last listed for_sale at $ 1.9 million . If it sells , the house , which sits on 13 acres tucked into a hillside off Mulholland Drive , figures to yield $ 1.5 million , according to papers filed by the brothers ' probate attorney , Gail Kass . Adding in the cash on_hand , $ 651 # 948 , and the estimated net proceeds from the sale of the New Jersey condo , $ 90 # 000 , puts the estate at $ 2.2 million , not $ 3.4 million . Debts outstanding include the $ 864 # 000 Calabasas mortgage , estate_taxes estimated at $ 600 # 000 , probate attorney ' s fees and executors ' commissions . If those were all paid immediately , the estate would have $ 310 # 000 left , Kass figured . Meanwhile , interest on the Calabasas mortgage and the taxes is accruing at some $ 146 # 000 annually , Kass estimated . The estate also owes $ 200 # 000 in court costs from the murder trial ; that money is_due to go_to the county , which advanced the funds . Tax attorneys and accountants also are_due to present more bills . If paid , it all would leave the estate with less than zero . What about the $ 651 # 948 in cash on_hand ? It can ' t simply be allocated to the brothers ' defense . Under the probate law , taxes , the Calabasas mortgage and other expenses take a priority . Besides , attorneys stressed , the estate is under no obligation to pay_for the defense .</TEXT>
