   <HEADLINE> SYRIA TRUMPETS CLINTON-ASSAD TALKS AS EPIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the height of President Clinton ' s European tour last week , the 14 million residents of this highly structured , tightly controlled nation were bombarded with news of an event of historic -- even epic -- proportions . &quot; A meeting between the two giants , &quot; declared one of the state-run daily newspapers that deliver Syria ' s official line each day . &quot; A strategic turning point that will decide the future of the region for years to come , &quot; announced another . &quot; Over the past 20 years , no summit between two world leaders has received as much attention as this , &quot; proclaimed a third . The focus of the hyperbolic Syrian spin was not Clinton ' s meeting with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , an event that merited barely a mention here in the capital of a nation that was once among Moscow ' s closest Middle_East allies . Nor was it the nuclear disarmament treaty signed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk last week . The event that was the subject of Damascus ' rhetorical blizzard was the summit scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. today in Geneva between Clinton and Hafez Assad , the authoritarian Syrian president who has outlasted five of his American counterparts and a litany of U.S. legislation aimed at isolating his regime . So intense was the hype and so high are the expectations surrounding today ' s summit that everyone from Clinton_Administration officials in Washington to the diplomatic corps and Syria ' s intellectual elite in Damascus found themselves trying to temper it . They have warned that the Clinton-Assad meeting is unlikely to produce an immediate , concrete breakthrough in the stalled Middle_East peace process , nor will it alter overnight America ' s strained relations with a nation that it has long viewed_as a renegade . Yet among even the most cynical of those analysts , officials and diplomats stressed that the meeting will likely be a landmark of the Mideast ' s painful path to peace -- a watershed that most agreed will help pave the way for a future peace agreement between Israel and its most bitter , best-armed neighbor . &quot; You ' re not going_to come_up with a peace_treaty in a three-hour meeting , &quot; one Western diplomat said in Damascus . &quot; In the next three to six months , you will see something . The peace process demands they do something . And this meeting is the first real key to unlocking the impasse. &quot; Sadik Azm , a Damascus University professor and prominent Syrian intellectual , agreed . &quot; There is a consensus now that this peace agreement is going_to go_through . Not immediately -- maybe in three months or six months . Maybe a year . But this is the first time there has been this kind of certainty here . There is skepticism , resignation and some healthy cynicism . But there also is optimism , in the sense that this meeting opens_up a bold new game . It is a turning point. &quot; The official mood in Damascus continued to be decidedly upbeat on the eve of the summit . &quot; We are optimistic , &quot; Information Minister Muhamed Salman told The Times in a rare interview Saturday night in Damascus . Outlining the basic position Assad will bring_to the summit table today , Salman said : &quot; Syria considers Israel its enemy because Israel occupies part of its land , and also Israel occupies part of Lebanon ' s land . When Israel will withdraw from the occupied territories , there will be some change for Syria . &quot; But nobody should expect Syria will compromise on its land. &quot; In Jerusalem , Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said Saturday that Israel will give_back all_of the Golan Heights -- the strategic plateau that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle_East War -- if Syria pledges that it is ready for full peace and normal relations , the Associated Press reported . Salman repeated Syria ' s harsh criticism of the agreement for limited Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho signed_in September by Israel and Yasser Arafat ' s Palestine Liberation Organization , which broke ranks from Syria and the other Arab delegations in the peace process to negotiate the accord in secret . &quot; Peace cannot be in pieces , &quot; he said , echoing Assad ' s longstanding demand for a comprehensive peace settlement between Israel and all its neighbors simultaneously . &quot; After the Gaza-Jericho agreement , the situation worsened in the occupied territories , and it spread more instability through the region. &quot; But Salman concluded on a positive note . &quot; We really seek and cling_to peace. &quot; And , when asked whether the Syrian people would support any such agreement with Israel , Salman said : &quot; The trust President Hafez Assad enjoys from his people will make the majority of the people back all_of the steps the president takes. &quot; It is not the first such meeting between an American President and the cunning , calculating Syrian leader whose name means &quot; lion &quot; but whose shrewd tactics more often are likened to those of a fox . It is an event that Washington insiders and Syrian analysts described as a task fraught with far more risks for Clinton than for Assad . In summits that have spanned two decades , Assad has met Richard Nixon in Damascus and Jimmy_Carter and George_Bush in Geneva -- the summit site of choice for a Syrian leader who has never been to America and has always insisted that U.S. presidents meet him halfway . In each summit past , American presidents have met with Assad when they had compelling reasons to do so : * Nixon , on a Middle_East tour , unsuccessfully sought to shift public attention away from Watergate two months before his resignation in 1974 . * Carter tried , also unsuccessfully , to broker a Middle_East peace process in 1977 similar to the one that began in Madrid in 1991 . * Bush used it to appeal for , and win , Assad ' s backing for America ' s international military coalition to drive Iraq from Kuwait in 1990 . Clinton requested today ' s summit with Assad through Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher last month , hoping that it will serve as a dramatic gesture of reassurance that the Syrian strongman remains the pivotal player in the peace process . This is a center-stage role that Assad , who views himself as the chief architect of the future Middle_East and a singular leader in the region , has assumed for years and one that fueled his personal outrage after Arafat secretly negotiated the accord with Israel . With talks between the PLO and Israel mired in details and their historic agreement to begin Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho now delayed by weeks , Clinton is gambling that the attention he lavishes on Assad will jump-start the equally crucial peace talks between Israel and Syria , which also holds the key to similar accords with Lebanon and Jordan . For Assad , who remains in firm control of Syria and wields ultimate influence over neighboring Lebanon , the summit is virtually risk-free . Analysts said his position remains remarkably unchanged from the one that met Nixon two decades ago : The return of the entire Golan Heights in exchange for a peace_treaty with his Jewish neighbors . &quot; The absolute red_line for him is the sovereignty of Golan , &quot; Azm said . &quot; I think everything else is negotiable . He ' s a very smart , shrewd tactician . He knows how to play his cards . And , after the PLO agreement , he has kept all his options open. &quot; Further , in a police_state where Assad controls the media and all levers of power , last week ' s summit hype was testimonial to how another Syrian described the task for Syria ' s president : &quot; Here , whatever he ( Assad ) does is always presented as a success before it happens . Even if nothing happens in Geneva , it will be described here as , ' The president stood_fast in the face of Clinton ' s demands. ' &quot; State_Department officials and analysts in Washington agreed that the meeting will be a far more daunting task for Clinton , particularly after the grueling week of crucial , complex and far-reaching diplomacy that preceded it . Assad , perhaps the smartest and certainly the most meticulous leader in the region , has been preparing_for the session at least since December . Rhetoric alone is critical in meetings with a leader as formal and copious as Assad ; William B . Quandt , a former National Security_Council expert on the Middle_East , noted that the Syrian president can take a single slip of the lip far more seriously than it was intended . To illustrate , he described just such an incident from Nixon ' s 1974 summit with Assad . &quot; Nixon said the American strategy was to get the Israelis to pull_back on the Golan in a step-by-step fashion , which was our policy , &quot; Quandt recalled . &quot; Then he said , ' When they reach the edge , they will topple over. ' Assad loved it . He took this as an American commitment that we would try to bring_about full Israeli withdrawal. &quot; Still , Quandt believes that , on balance , the Clinton-Assad meeting is likely to advance the peace process . &quot; There are times when meeting with leaders who are not exactly paragons of democracy and human_rights is in the interest of U.S. foreign_policy , &quot; he said . As for the American agenda today , U.S. officials said it will be limited to Middle_East issues . They held_out little hope for Assad ' s longer-range goal of reshaping his entire relationship with America -- a decision dating to the Soviet_Union ' s collapse to moderate his policies and reach_out to the United States and the West . Assad ' s ultimate aim , analysts said , is to get his nation off the American list of nations sponsoring terrorism and the accompanying U.S. economic sanctions ; the State_Department has already indicated that will not occur at least until Syria makes_peace with Israel . But officials added that Clinton intends to press Syria on an array of bilateral issues , among them Assad ending his support for terrorist groups headquartered in Damascus and improving his regime ' s human_rights record . The Syrians have jailed an estimated 4 # 000 political_prisoners for years , despite the recent release of 3 # 500 others . Given the circumstances surrounding the summit , some American critics cautioned that the young President may_not be nearly tough enough . &quot; Clinton must resist Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s inclination to appease Assad with diplomatic concessions for merely returning to the talks &quot; with Israel , the conservative Heritage Foundation said of today ' s meeting . &quot; This would only reward Assad for his delaying tactics and stiffen his future negotiating demands . In Geneva , Clinton should press Assad to reverse Syrian policies that threaten American interests , not reward him for participating in peace talks that serve his own interests. &quot; A senior State_Department official denied that Christopher has tried to &quot; appease &quot; Assad . The official added that Christopher , who will attend the Geneva summit , has established a rapport with Assad and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , a step vital to American efforts to broker a Mideast agreement . Another senior State_Department official suggested that Clinton may break_with his predecessors ' practices and meet for a second or third time with the Syrian leader . &quot; To deal with Assad effectively over time , you have to create a relationship , &quot; the official said . &quot; Clinton has at least three and maybe seven more years in office. &quot; In Damascus , where Assad is expected to keep his office longer , similar optimism prevailed . &quot; People don ' t expect any major breakthrough , in the sense that there will be a great document or agreement , &quot; Azm said . &quot; But sometimes in these situations , people in power understand each other in ways that escape us. &quot; Fineman reported from Damascus and Kempster from Washington .
