   <HEADLINE> UNCLE TO THE RESCUE ; CRIME : NEWLY ARRIVED PERUVIAN MAN , ALREADY VICTIMIZED BY U.S. THIEVES , CHASES A SUSPECTED ABDUCTOR WHO RELEASES HIS YOUNG NIECE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the day Hernan Salazar arrived here from Peru to visit his sister , thieves stole his luggage from her car . Then , not long into his visit , a man tried to kidnap his 7-year-old niece . This time , Salazar fought_back . Salazar , 30 , was trying to deal with the loss of his luggage when a man slipped into his sister ' s apartment and lifted Fabiola Lopez from her bed , police said . The man got_in through an apparently unlocked sliding door and walked_out with Fabiola flopped over his shoulder , awakening other family members . They ran_out of the apartment screaming for her . Salazar said he spotted the man outside , and shouted in Spanish for him to let_go_of the girl . The abductor dropped her and fled , he said . Salazar , a former police_officer in Peru , alerted a Tustin police_officer who was giving a driver a ticket , and police soon swarmed the area . A police_dog followed a scent to some bushes , where Pablo Vasquez Bojorquez , 35 , was hiding , police said . Bojorquez , a Tustin ice_cream vendor who lives across the street from the family , was being held_on suspicion of kidnaping and burglary Thursday . Tustin police Sgt . Mike Pettifer said Bojorquez told investigators he ran_into the Lopez apartment for refuge when two men tried to rob him . When he saw Fabiola in bed -- in the arms of her sleeping grandmother -- he figured that the robbers would not attack him on the street if he had a little_girl with him , Bojorquez reportedly told police . &quot; that ' s a new one to us , &quot; Pettifer said of Bojorquez ' s explanation . Salazar , 30 , said he was thankful his niece was not hurt . But &quot; things have not gone well for us here , &quot; Salazar said . &quot; I ' m going_back to Peru as soon as possible. &quot; He plans to stay as long as police need him to resolve the kidnaping case . Fabiola ' s mother , Berta Lopez , was still shaken Thursday &quot; What intentions did the kidnaper have when he grabbed her ? &quot; she said . &quot; Did he want to violate her ? Kill her ? I don ' t even want to think_about it. &quot; * Lopez , 33 , a homemaker and baby-sitter , said her world would have been ruined if her only child had vanished . &quot; I came here from Peru five years ago to try to make a better life for my daughter , &quot; she said . &quot; Finally , a year and a half ago , I was able to go_back to get Fabiola and bring her here. &quot; On Tuesday night , her family had had a reunion , eaten a Peruvian dinner of rice and chicken and talked late into the night . About half an hour after Fabiola and her grandmother went_to_sleep in a bed set_up in the living room , the grandmother felt someone take her . At first she thought Fabiola ' s father , Luis Lopez , had gotten her out of bed to take her to the bathroom . &quot; I yelled to my daughter , ' Is Luis there with you ? ' &quot; Eloina Salazar , 59 , said . &quot; When she said yes , I yelled that someone took the child. &quot; Fabiola ' s mother said that &quot; in the moment the man took her and I ran_out of the apartment screaming her name , I thought_of Polly Klaas , &quot; she said . Klaas , a 12-year-old from Petaluma , Calif. , was abducted from her bedroom last year and strangled . Hernan Salazar also sped out_to the street in his undershorts , yelling &quot; Security ! Policia ! &quot; &quot; If I had stopped to put_on pants , who knows how far he could have gone , &quot; he said . When Hernan Salazar found the alleged kidnaper on the street , he ordered him to drop Fabiola . He ran after the man after he dropped her , but gave_up the chase when he saw another man , who he thought might be an accomplice , get_out of a nearby car . Finding an officer who spoke Spanish was lucky , Salazar said . * &quot; If he didn ' t understand Spanish , he probably would have thought I was crazy , &quot; he said . Tustin police_officers found a pair of sandals the alleged kidnaper kicked_off during the chase , and waved them under the nose of Artur , a German_shepherd , who followed it to the shrubs . Lopez said she plans to move_out of Tustin to an apartment_building with secured entrances . On Thursday , Fabiola , known as &quot; Fabby , &quot; danced around her apartment in a summer dress and looked_forward to going swimming . She was pleased that her mother had promised to buy a VCR and videos so she could watch her favorite movies . All Fabiola remembered from the abduction , she said , was that a man picked her up and walked outside with her . &quot; I thought it was my uncle Hernan , &quot; Fabiola said . &quot; Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. &quot; If convicted , Bojorquez could face more_than nine years in state_prison , deputy public_defender Robert A . Knox said . He remains in custody on $ 50 # 000 bail . Police said there apparently was no accomplice . &quot; I think the uncle did the right thing , &quot; Pettifer said . &quot; He confronted the guy verbally enough to get the girl back , but not enough to cause harm to him or to the girl . He ' s more or less a hero. &quot; Times staff writers Anna Cekola and Greg Hernandez contributed to this story .</TEXT>
