   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : KOREATOWN ; A MARRIAGE THAT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In preparation for their parents ' recent wedding_anniversary , Chan-Yong Kim and his brother and sister decided to look_up the traditional anniversary names . The list says silver for the 25th anniversary ; gold for the 50th . If a couple makes_it to 60 years , it ' s their diamond anniversary . But what about after that ? &quot; No one knew . . . &quot; Kim said . &quot; I guess no one figured that any couple would be married beyond 60 years. &quot; Well , recently , Kim ' s father , Jae-Ok Kim , and mother , Ok-Sun Kim , of Koreatown celebrated a union that has spanned three-quarters of a century and two continents . &quot; I don ' t remember ever having a fight , &quot; said Ok-Sun Kim , who at 87 is a year older than her husband . As was the custom at the time in their native Korea , the marriage was arranged by the couple ' s parents . She was 12 , he was 11 , although they did not live together as husband and wife until they were in their 20s , said Chan-Yong Kim , 60 , the oldest of the couple ' s three children . &quot; In those days , parents made the arrangements so as not to lose the opportunity for having a good son-in-law or a good daughter-in-law , &quot; explained Chan-Yong Kim . After the wedding , the couple lived at his parents ' house near the city of Kaesong , now in North_Korea . With the outbreak of the Korean_War , the family fled to the port city of Inchon and then moved to Seoul in the late 1950s . In 1973 , the couple moved to Southern California , where their children were pursuing educations and careers . They moved_into an apartment_building in Koreatown , where they became active in a Korean senior_citizens ' group and their church . Unlike many older Korean couples , the Kims can occasionally be seen holding hands when they walk down the street , said Kyung-Yong Kim , their second son . Chan-Yong Kim , who runs a tae_kwon_do school in Cerritos , sees his parents as role_models for couples : &quot; Maybe times aren ' t always happy , but when an unfavorable situation develops , rather than saying , ' The heck with it , ' there ' s always a way . . . to work things out. &quot; The Guinness Book of World_Records lists two couples who were married for 86 years , so the Kims have a goal . In the meantime , Ok-Sun Kim has a simple plan : &quot; After all these years , my responsibility is to continue to love my husband , never hurt his feelings and make_sure he eats well. &quot; JAKE DOHERTY</TEXT>
