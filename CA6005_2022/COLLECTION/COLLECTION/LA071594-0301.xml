   <HEADLINE> ELIXIRS OF LOVE ? ; TWO SCIENTISTS HAVE BOTTLED COMPETING PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO ENHANCE ROMANCE -- OR AT LEAST MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With names like Realm and Athena , they certainly sound sexy , like something you ' d see advertised in the back of a magazine -- and we ' re not talking_about Highlights or the Nation . They ' re two new fragrance products created with the ages-old goal of enhancing romance . Exposure on TV news and talk_shows , in science and health magazines and in newspapers has helped fuel brisk sales , their promoters say . But some independent scientists have questions about how the biochemistry works , and the Food and Drug Administration might soon start sniffing around , too . The inventors of Realm and Athena are rival scientists-turned-entrepreneurs , each of whom claims to have developed the only formula containing pheromones -- airborne chemical messengers released by one body to affect others of the same species . The inventors stress that the products are cosmetics and not aphrodisiacs , which would make them drugs in the eyes of the FDA and bring_about closer scrutiny . One , called Realm , comes as two perfumes -- one for women and one for men . It was developed by Dr. David Berliner , a former University of Utah researcher who founded Pherin Corp. , a pharmaceutical development company in Menlo Park , Calif. , and Erox Corp . in Fremont , Calif. , a consumer product company whose first venture is these Realm perfumes . &quot; This , &quot; says Michael Stern , Erox ' s vice_president of sales and marketing , &quot; is not snake_oil . It promotes attractiveness by making the wearer feel good. &quot; The other product -- a fragrance additive for women -- is Athena Pheromone 10:13 . It was developed by former University of Pennsylvania researcher Winnifred Cutler , who conducted studies at the Monell Chemical Senses Center -- a respected , nonprofit research company in Philadelphia -- and later founded her own research company , the Athena Institute of Women ' s Wellness in Haverford , Pa . &quot; This , &quot; she says , &quot; is not snake_oil . It definitely promotes sexual attractiveness. &quot; Still , an FDA official says the agency might take a closer look . &quot; Anything that claims -- either by advertising , labeling or word_of_mouth -- to promote sexual attractiveness or performance would be considered an aphrodisiac , and therefore likely a drug , &quot; says John Bailey , acting director of the FDA ' s Office of Cosmetics and Colors_in Washington , D.C. Bailey , who had not heard of Realm or Athena , says he is &quot; aware of products today being promoted as fragrances that are somehow mood-altering. &quot; Because drugs require FDA approval , Bailey says it ' s a &quot; pretty good bet &quot; his agency will look_at both products and take regulatory action , if necessary . &quot; ( These ) sound like a new twist on old types of products that claim to produce changes in mental_states , &quot; he says . * Just what is it about pheromones that has everyone so excited ? While their existence in insects and mammals has long been scientifically established -- among other functions , they ' re what cause male dogs to chase female dogs in heat -- human pheromones are less understood . In 1986 , Cutler and then-colleague George Preti published research in the scientific journal Hormones and Behavior about the possibility of human pheromones , findings widely publicized in national mainstream media . ( Time magazine headlined it &quot; The Hidden Power of Body Odors. &quot; ) The studies , conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and the Monell center , indicated that substances extracted from male and female underarm secretions and later applied under a woman ' s nose could beneficially alter the timing of her menstrual periods . Although the precise nature and chemical workings of the collected substances were not reported , Cutler then speculated that synthetic versions could have practical_applications in areas of infertility , menopause and birth_control . Says Cutler of that time : &quot; My dream was that manufactured pheromones , in creams , sprays or perfumes , could dramatically alter the well-being of women. &quot; Cutler left Monell to found the Athena Institute , and for the next seven years investigated pheromones independently while applying for patents and figuring_out how to produce a product in quantity . Last September , she released 10:13 as a &quot; cosmetic additive to promote romance &quot; ; appeared on &quot; Sally Jessy Raphael , &quot; &quot; The Montel Williams Show &quot; and other talk_shows to tout it ; impressed a self-described California &quot; romance therapist &quot; enough to recommend it , and subsequently sold by mail and phone &quot; many thousands of vials &quot; at $ 95 for one-sixth of an ounce . &quot; This is a natural outcome of two decades of research , &quot; she says of her formula , designed to be mixed with about two ounces of a woman ' s favorite non-spray fragrance and dabbed on every day and worn for at least six hours for maximum effectiveness . So , does_it work ? Preti , an organic chemist who still works_at Monell , doesn ' t see how this product could have grown from any research he ' s aware of . He says his past work with Cutler demonstrated only that there was in underarm secretions &quot; something physiologically active &quot; that can affect a woman ' s menstrual_cycle . Says Preti : &quot; Where she comes_up with the other contention -- put_on the magic potion and your love life will improve -- I have no idea . There ' s no real evidence that sexual attractants ( in humans ) exist. &quot; But Cutler says she has unpublished , &quot; sophisticated research &quot; that shows human pheromones do promote sexual attraction and that her synthetic pheromone product achieves this for about 70 % of women . * Meanwhile , Berliner , speaking from his office at Pherin , says his discovery of human pheromones and their resulting products ( &quot; the first and only fragrances to contain human pheromones , &quot; reads an Erox Corp . annual report ) had its origins three decades ago . He was studying human skin at the University of Utah then and had gathered specimens from the insides of broken-legged skiers ' casts , extracts that were left in open containers . Over time , he noticed that he and other laboratory workers were &quot; unusually friendly and communicative , &quot; he says . &quot; They even wanted to play bridge , which was very unusual. &quot; But when Berliner covered the flasks , everyone went_back to their &quot; normal selves , &quot; he says . Berliner froze the samples and put them aside until 1989 , when after seeing reports from Monell and other studies , he returned to the skin_cells with the idea that human pheromones were responsible_for the feel-good phenomenon he had observed . Berliner figured_out the chemical structure of what he called pheromones , synthesized them and went seeking proof that what he had were indeed pheromones . The key , he thought , lay_in the vomeronasal organ , or VNO , a &quot; sixth-sense &quot; nasal organ that in animals detects odorless pheromones , many of which are related to sexual behavior . The VNO had long been believed absent or at least dormant in adult humans , but Berliner had read then-little-known research that led him to think human adults may have functioning VNOs . So he gathered colleagues and asked them to help investigate . The resulting 1991 company-sponsored research report concluded not only that the human VNO exists and functions , but that it was stimulated by at least two of Berliner ' s compounds , which were not identified in the report . ( These findings have not yet been corroborated by independent researchers. ) Berliner says that once he knew he had pheromones , he formed Erox and developed perfumes . Because the quick-diffusing pheromones in Realm don ' t work_on anyone more_than a foot away , he says , the products are targeted for the wearer , rather than anyone of the opposite sex nearby . So do they work ? Wearers report &quot; feeling more romantic , more attractive and happier , &quot; the Realm brochure says . Last December and January , Erox obtained patents for compounds ( including fragrances ) containing human pheromones . ( The patents state the names of the &quot; compositions &quot; found to stimulate the VNOs of males and females , but not Realm ' s formulas. ) The human pheromones he put_in Realm have nothing to do with sexual attractiveness , Berliner says , because that would make Realm an aphrodisiac . Instead , pheromones in Realm have to do with &quot; good vibes. &quot; &quot; Sometimes you ' ll be in the presence of a person and either feel good or not feel good , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a chemical communication that we call good or bad vibes. &quot; The 1993 Erox shareholder report ' s section on marketing strategy describes planned development of promotional_materials that &quot; suggest the enhanced sensuality &quot; Realm users may experience . But sensuality is not the same as sexuality , Berliner says . &quot; If I am wearing Realm , I am feeling very secure about myself . I feel more ready and at that moment there ' s a communication factor . The woman feels it and there ' s a sensuality . It ' s a very different thing than sexuality. &quot; Despite a truncated initial marketing effort , the company sold more_than 660 units of Realm , at $ 60 for 1.7 ounces , in May via word_of_mouth , says Stern , the marketing executive . Preti , the organic chemist , says he admires Berliner and associates ' work_on the VNO but reserves judgment on pheromone claims . &quot; There may be a compound that stimulates the VNO -- that part of this work is excellent , &quot; he says . &quot; But saying that the type of molecule they have is a pheromone because it stimulates the VNO is somewhat silly to me. &quot; Preti wonders about Erox ' s definition of pheromones . Says the company literature : &quot; Human pheromones don ' t arouse sexual_desire ; nor do they heighten sexual_pleasure . Instead , they help you feel more attractive by enhancing positive feelings such_as comfort , security , well-being and confidence. &quot; &quot; They created a new definition , &quot; Preti says . &quot; Sounds like a California-type thing to me . The FDA may look_at it differently , and that ' s what all these people are deathly afraid of. &quot; Both Cutler and Berliner say they are careful to make no claims that would warrant FDA attention . Says Cutler : &quot; All aphrodisiacs are illegal . We ' re scrupulous in only making cosmetic claims and disclaiming any aphrodisiac or drug role for our product. &quot; Says Berliner : &quot; We ' re not claiming to be curing any diseases here . Realm is strictly a cosmetic. &quot; Customer comments provided by Cutler and Stern sound like testimonials . Wrote one Athena customer who mixed 10:13 with Shalimar and then went_out with her boyfriend : &quot; Our relationship has intensified in the most wonderful way . He ' s begun to look_at me wistfully . . . and faxes poetry to me . This was not his style prior to ( using the product. ) He ' s become very exciting , and the pull between us is almost tangible. &quot; Cutler also has written testimonials from a &quot; happily married Las Vegas stripper &quot; who got $ 120 in tips_in just 45 minutes , a Florida nurse who for the first time in years felt her sexual_desire return , and an executive whose &quot; sales ratios &quot; with male clients increased . Stern provides anecdotes from customers who will appear on a planned infomercial . One is a woman in the finance business who works with her husband of two decades . Their marriage had &quot; gone flat , &quot; Stern says , until they both started using Realm . &quot; They went_away for a weekend and had_the_best time they ' d had in years , &quot; Stern says . &quot; They believe that using Realm rekindled the spark that was really there. &quot; Cutler won ' t say whether she uses her product , but Erox ' s Stern says he uses Realm Men every day . &quot; It ' s like having a good hair day , &quot; he says , &quot; like a little pick-me-up . You feel calm , cool and collected so the real you can come out. &quot;</TEXT>
