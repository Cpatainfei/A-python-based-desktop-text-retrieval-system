   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : UTILITY STOCKS HAVE MORE POWER THAN YOU THINK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You ' d think the lights were going_out all_over the world the way investors have been dumping electric utility stocks . Since September , utility shares on average have lost 30 % of their value ; stocks of California utilities have been in a swan dive for the last month . Rising interest_rates and a profound , historic change in the electric_power business are behind the headlong plunge . But panic is always unwise . Cooler analysis of trends in the utility business shows real value and an exciting future there . First , understand the factors that have caused the decline . Rising interest_rates are partly to blame because they reduce the investment attraction of utility dividends . However , on Tuesday , as the Federal_Reserve_Board again hiked short-term rates , the Dow Jones utility average rose 2.38 points , reflecting investor belief that rising rates may now pause , allowing utility shares to shine . But far more important is the competitive change in the business . Utility stocks began falling_in September when the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor ' s issued re-evaluations of electric_companies based on their &quot; competitive business position , &quot; a ranking based on how vulnerable a company would be to competition from other suppliers selling cheaper power to its customers . And California utilities sank last month after the Public_Utilities Commission proposed total deregulation by 2002 , which would allow all customers to shop around for power . One Wall_Street analyst called it a &quot; populist , damn-the-torpedoes restructuring of a major part of the economy with no evidence that the existing system can be improved in efficiency. &quot; But that reaction is off the mark . The California regulators simply recognized that competition has already come_to the business . Big industrial users exercise options in buying power today . Ohio and other states have bills before their legislatures proposing deregulation of electric_power . * To understand what ' s happening , ask yourself this question : If McDonald ' s can order all its hamburger_rolls from a single baker in Kansas City , why can ' t it buy electricity for all its stores from a single supplier , rather than paying electric_companies in each state and locality ? In England , McDonald ' s now buys electricity for roughly 200 stores from a single supplier rather than a dozen . The savings begin with a reduction in paperwork . National Westminster Bank is headquartered in London but buys its electricity from a utility in the eastern part of Britain . &quot; It saves $ 15 million a year doing so , &quot; reports Edward Tirello , a utility analyst for NatWest Securities , a U.S. subsidiary of the_British bank . Britain has separated electric_power generation from transmission and distribution to homes and businesses and found that this produced economies . By 1998 , Britain plans to have a switch in every home , allowing residential customers to go from coal-generated to gas-generated electricity at will , depending_on which is cheaper at the moment . And that British model is very much on the minds of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington . That agency , with responsibility for utilities , knows that U.S. &quot; national chains , supermarkets , shopping_malls , local school_boards want to buy electricity competitively , the way they buy telephone_services , &quot; says Richard O ' Neill , director of economic_policy for the FERC . Long-distance telephone competition was opened_up 10 years ago with the breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph , and local competition is spreading today . Many experts envision a similar breakup pattern for electric_power , with nine regional power generation providers and numerous transmission and local distribution companies . Future transmission and distribution companies may remain as local monopolies , such_as the Baby Bells , with regional generating companies freed up_to compete -- to take risks like any other business . McDonald ' s in the United States might buy power from regional suppliers who would arrange distribution to stores in each locality for a package-deal price . Investors ultimately may get hybrid holdings , one part regulated company paying a relatively safe dividend , the other a competitive company taking the risk of huge power_plants , fuel prices and the battle to win customers . There is nervousness , but also opportunity . Duff &amp; Phelps , the Chicago-based credit rating agency that specializes in utilities , notes that California companies -- Pacific Gas &amp; Electric , Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric -- have been forced to buy high-priced power from independent suppliers , a boondoggle dating to the energy-crisis 1970s . But under deregulation , the utilities should be able to dispense_with such purchases or reduce what they pay . * To be sure , if you need steady dividend income now , utilities might not be the best place for your money . But for ambitious employees and investors , the once-sleeply utility business will prove very interesting in this decade . The successful utility of the future would keep costs low and be aggressive . Other_than that , no particular advantage stands_out among companies qualifying for Standard &amp; Poor ' s list of those with an &quot; above average business position. &quot; Subsidiaries of Columbus , Ohio ' s American Electric_Power are_on the list , and so is Pacificorp , the Portland , Ore.-based company that wants to sell power in California . Analyst Tirello wrote to clients that &quot; while competition will create a multitude of losers , &quot; some companies will prosper -- among them , Duke Power of Charlotte , N.C. , and Florida Power &amp; Light , which has cut its dividend because it wants cash to finance growth . Tirello also favors PG &amp; E because he thinks fears that shareholders will be stuck_with a big bill for the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant are overblown . The telephone precedent is reassuring for utility investors : Stockholders of AT &amp; T who received shares of seven Baby Bells , plus a share of the new AT &amp; T in the 1984 breakup , have seen their investment almost quadruple in the intervening decade . Change , as they say , is constant -- but that ' s not a bad thing .</TEXT>
