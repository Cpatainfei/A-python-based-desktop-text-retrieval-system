   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : THE SUNDAY SHOWDOWN : SUMMER ' S WINNERS , LOSERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So which bands won at the Woodstock mud fights ? Is there no place on the charts for a nice rap act like Arrested Development ? If Meat_Loaf can come_back strong after all these years , why couldn ' t another relic -- Boston ? Pop Eye will aim for answers in the Sunday Showdown , a periodic feature that will turn_to retailers , radio executives and other industry insiders to help pinpoint the ups and downs of pop fortunes . This edition looks_at this summer : The Winners * Woodstock mud -- Of the dozens of acts that played the Woodstock ' 94 festival last month , the two that emerged with the biggest commercial momentum were the two that got_down and dirty , literally : Nine Inch Nails and Green Day . NIN ' s mud-covered leader Trent Reznor and mud-slinging Green Day certainly made_for the most compelling media illustrations of bands that were seizing -- and defining -- the Woodstock moment for the ' 90s . And even though both bands were already hot , record sales for both have increased since the festival , with NIN ' s &quot; The Downward Spiral &quot; album moving from No . 45 on Billboard ' s album chart pre-Woodstock to No . 23 last week and &quot; Dookie &quot; by Green Day ( whose performance was marked by a mud battle with the audience and a fight with security_guards ) from No . 13 to No . 4 . &quot; Green Day was_on fire anyway , &quot; says Jeff Pollack , president of_his_own media consulting_firm . &quot; But this ( mud scuffle ) gave them a shove . They got substantially more record sales , and all it cost ( singer Billie Joe ) was a_few teeth. &quot; * Soundtrack albums -- &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; have held the top two chart spots for nearly two months , with other expected movie tie-in hits coming , including &quot; Natural Born Killers , &quot; &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and &quot; Fresh. &quot; Our panelists pointed to last year ' s &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; as the trend-setter , showing record and movie executives that there ' s more to movie-related albums than just a collection of songs . &quot; It ' s much more of an art_form than it used to be , &quot; says Pollack . &quot; They used to make them half-assed , but films like ' Sleepless in Seattle ' made_it part of the movie ' s mood from the start. &quot; * R . Kelly -- His own &quot; 12 Play &quot; album is still hot ( No . 57 after 42 weeks with more_than 3 million sold ) , his protegee Aaliyah ' s &quot; Age Ain ' t Nothing but a Number &quot; is even hotter ( No . 25 ) , and his &quot; Stroke You Up &quot; by Changing Faces is the No . 2 single . While on the surface his biggest selling point is sex -- &quot; All the songs are about sex , &quot; says Wherehouse Records new-release buyer Bob Bell -- Kelly ' s seen as a major future force . &quot; He ' s an awesome talent as a writer , performer and producer who has the potential of becoming another Babyface in terms of his impact , &quot; says Ken Barnes , editor of the Radio &amp; Records trade publication . * Mazzy Star -- It ' s still far from the Top 10 , but the L.A. band ' s dreamy &quot; So Tonight That I May See &quot; even being in the Top 50 -- and rising -- makes_it the dark_horse of the summer . It was released a year ago and languished beneath the Top 200 until MTV started playing the video for &quot; Fade Into You &quot; last month . Our panelists congratulate Capitol Records executives for sticking_with the record and giving it a second chance to find , as one says , &quot; the yuppie alternative demographic out here that this is perfect for. &quot; The Losers * Spin_Doctors -- This band was the Mazzy Star of 1992 , its &quot; Pocketful of Kryptonite &quot; album becoming a 3-million-selling hit only after going unnoticed by the pop world for a full year . The early performance of the new &quot; Turn It Upside Down , &quot; though , makes_it look as if the group has lost its super powers . It ' s wallowing at No . 70 with sales of less than 300 # 000 after 11 weeks of release . Several panelists are not ready to bury the album , but think that the band and Epic Records made a perhaps insurmountable mistake in releasing the &quot; real radio-unfriendly &quot; song &quot; Cleopatra &quot; as the first single . &quot; It ' s the kind of song that I call a center divider -- it ' s so bad that you have to avoid hitting the center divider when it comes_on the car radio , &quot; says one contributor . * Sir Mix-A-Lot -- The Seattle rapper ' s ode to les derrieres , &quot; Baby Got Back , &quot; was the No . 1 single of 1992 . But his new paean to breasts , &quot; Put ' em on the Glass , &quot; hasn ' t even pushed the current album , &quot; Chief Boot Knocka , &quot; any higher than No . 69 in the pop chart . ( It was at No . 150 last week. ) Live_by the novelty hit , die by the novelty hit , say our experts : &quot; I don ' t know how far you can go_with rapping about different body parts. &quot; * Boston -- Comparisons to Meat Loaf are inevitable given both acts ' ' 70s identification and current affiliation with MCA Records . But even with many years between releases , Boston had maintained a better profile than Mr. Loaf -- all three of its albums , including the last , 1986 ' s &quot; Third Stage &quot; -- were multimillion-selling smashes . So when Meat_Loaf ' s comeback last year sold more_than 4 million , many expected Boston ' s fourth album , &quot; Walk On , &quot; to follow_suit . No dice . It debuted strongly , reaching No . 7 , but quickly dropped and after 12 weeks in the stores is No . 107 and falling , though it has reached the &quot; gold &quot; 500 # 000 sales mark . Meat_Loaf has more personality than the faceless Boston , and his &quot; Bat Out of Hell II : Back Into Hell &quot; had more fodder for pop radio . Boston ' s stuck_on classic-rock , and album rock stations , our experts point_out , don ' t help sell records . &quot; Boston represents the formula-corporate music that the current upheaval in new music has left_behind , thankfully. &quot; * Arrested Development -- Besides having a virtually unpronounceable title , the new album &quot; Zingalamaduni &quot; has been pretty much unsellable -- a dramatic contrast to the group ' s Grammy-winning 1992 debut , which sold more_than 2 million . Woodstock exposure helped return the new album to the Top 200 ( to No . 188 ) and then it was back_off the chart the next week . Industry insiders seem to be rooting for this group as a positive antidote to the gangsta rap that dominates the charts , but say that to turn things around group leader Speech must stop all his &quot; preachy &quot; theorizing and stick_to rapping . &quot; After the first record , he kept saying people were missing the message . This time he wanted to make_sure they got_it , but he forgot about the music. &quot; Steve Hochman</TEXT>
