   <HEADLINE> BILL BOYARSKY : THE SPIN ; HOW CELEBRITY , RACE ECLIPSE SPOUSAL ABUSE ISSUE IN SIMPSON CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sometimes I wonder how the O.J. Simpson story would have played if he ' d been someone else . Suppose , for example , he were a wealthy Brentwood attorney . How would we have written the story of his arrest for murder ? If the attorney had a record of spousal abuse like Simpson ' s and had surrendered quietly , we probably would have said : &quot; A Brentwood lawyer who had pleaded no contest to charges of beating his wife was arrested today on suspicion of murdering her and a male friend. &quot; The emphasis in the story would have been_on the suspect ' s pre-arrest behavior toward his dead wife . In Simpson ' s case , reports of abusive conduct brought police to their home a number of times prior to the killings . Instead , we wrote : &quot; O . J . Simpson , the football great who rose from the mean streets of San Francisco to international celebrity , was arrested Friday for the murders of his ex-wife and a male friend after leading police on a gripping two-hour chase through the rush-hour freeways of Southern California. &quot; * Simpson ' s celebrity and the circumstances of his arrest overwhelmed the issue of spousal abuse . So did race -- mainly fears in the black community that Simpson , who is African American , was being stampeded into the gas_chamber . The racial issue was evident last month when African American community leaders met with Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti . They suggested that Garcetti integrate his all-white , all-male panel of top aides who decide whether to seek the death_penalty in murder cases . John Mack , president of the Los Angeles Urban League , said the group also told Garcetti that Simpson &quot; be tried by a jury that is representative of the immense diversity of this city , including African Americans. &quot; The abuse issue was raised at a news_conference Aug . 1 by attorney Gloria Allred . She said Garcetti should seek the death_penalty . &quot; We agree with representatives of the African American community that the criminal justice system must respect Mr. Simpson ' s rights , &quot; she said . &quot; But we want to also emphasize that the same system must also respect the rights of the victims. &quot; A_few days after her comments , I received a telephone_call from a prominent African American civil_rights attorney , Melanie Lomax , asking why I hadn ' t written a column on Allred ' s views . &quot; I am infuriated by the reaction to the O.J. Simpson case , when it seems to completely eclipse the idea of spousal abuse , &quot; she said . &quot; I have the overwhelming sense that he was and remains an abusive man . And he must be held to account_for this particular spousal abuse and his history of terrorizing his former wife and his children. &quot; I was surprised to hear her criticize the African American leaders who met with Garcetti . Lomax is a leader who has been outspoken on the issue of fairness to African Americans . When Lomax was president of the Los Angeles Board of Police_Commissioners , she led the effort to oust Police_Chief Daryl F . Gates . And she ' s a force in politics as a contributor and fund-raiser . Lomax acknowledged that , as the African American leaders said , there have been &quot; glaring examples where the justice system did not work , &quot; such_as the Rodney G . King beating case . But she said the &quot; leadership ' s obligation is to define to the community some sort of moral commitment -- that murder is not OK , that violence toward women is not OK , and that you ' re not a hero in the community if you use your physical superiority to terrorize women . &quot; The leadership has permitted too many people to go_off in a tangent and not recognize the moral imperatives of this case , &quot; she said . &quot; Setting_aside the murder issue , the undisputed facts of threatening and stalking should be morally condemned . Instead , it seems they are wrapping their arms around him and I think it is appalling. &quot; Simpson ' s attorneys , Lomax said , are banking on community support . &quot; Clearly the defense is banking on a hung jury , &quot; she said . &quot; Clearly they are going_to play to African Americans , clearly they are going_to play to the sense of paranoid injustice that has a lot of merit . . . . The best we can hope for is that any African Americans on the jury do not look_on it in simplistic terms . . . . &quot; * This is a complicated issue . On Tuesday , leaders of Mothers in Action , an African American community group , held a news_conference to criticize the Allred position . &quot; Pitting the rights of African Americans and other persons_of_color against the rights of women will not be tolerated , &quot; said Johnnie Tillman-Blackston . Later in the day , Allred emphasized that she represented women of all races who have been victimized . &quot; This is not an issue of race , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s an issue of simple justice. &quot; What is certain is that these sensitive disputes , aired in the media , will be_on the minds of prosecutors , defense_attorneys and prospective jurors when the process of jury selection begins Sept . 19 .</TEXT>
