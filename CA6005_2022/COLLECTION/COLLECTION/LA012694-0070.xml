   <TEXT> The United States population grows by more_than 2.5 million people every year . China , Thailand , Indonesia , Iran , India , most Third_World countries , as well as the countries of Europe , have introduced family_planning programs in an attempt to bring their population under control.The United States has no such program . In addition , the United States has the fastest growing population in the industrialized world and boasts the highest incidence of teen-age pregnancy . If every birth to a teen mother had been delayed until the mother was in her 20s , the federal_government would have saved $ 11.7 billion in 1991 alone . Money is not the issue , however . Environmental degradation has reached crisis proportions . We need a family_planning program to join other nations to help bring the world ' s population under_control .
