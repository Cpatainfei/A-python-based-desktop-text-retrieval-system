   <HEADLINE> UNDERSTANDING D-DAY ; THE INVASION OF NORMANDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Success on &quot; the longest day &quot; was a giant step_on the road to destroying Nazi Germany . It allowed Allied ground forces to start their drive toward Berlin . The invasion , combining mostly U.S. , British and Canadian forces and code-named Operation Overlord , marked the beginning of the end of the Hitler regime . THE COMMANDERS Dwight D . ( Ike ) Eisenhower Named supreme allied commander , not only because military abilities , but also because of his political skills . Made final_decision to launch the invasion despite severe weather_conditions . &quot; I am quite positive that the order must be given ( not to postpone ) .... I don ' t like it , but there it is.... I don ' t see how we can do anything else. &quot; -- Eisenhower to his generals , June 4 , 1944 Erwin Rommel Charged with strengthening German defenses . Believed invasion must be stopped on beachesbecause once Allieds Allies were inland , their air superiority , larger_numbers and greater industrial production would defeat Germany . &quot; Believe me , Lang , the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive.... For the Allies , as well as Germany , it will be the longest day. &quot; -- Rommel to his aide , April 22 , 1944 PREPARING FOR THE INVASION Channel Crossing : Drive and Deception Central to D-day success is keeping secret the invasion target . To that end the Allies invest a great_deal of effort convincing Germans landings will take_place at Calais . Allied convoys converge at &quot; Piccadilly Circus &quot; and 255 minesweepers clear lanes through German minefield . As invasion force heads toward Normandy , other vessels sail toward Calais , towing special balloons that produce radar_echoes similar to those of troop ships . British bombers drop strips of aluminum_foil to produce other false radar images , and dummy paratroopers are dropped . Why Normandy ? * Close enough for England-based planes to provide air cover * Beaches large and flat enough to allow troops to be landed and supplied * Hinterland big enough to allow beachhead development * Not heavily defended * Nearby ports , essential to post-invasion supply INVASION COUNTDOWN On June 3 , the invasion force sailed , expecting a June 5 landing . But the weather was deteriorating . June 4 04:00 : Meteorologist tells Eisenhower June 5 will be overcast , stormy 06:00 : Eisenhower postpones landing 07:00 : Rommel leaves for Germany to see Hitler , celebrate wife ' s birthday 21:30 : Eisenhower told bad_weather will break on June 6 21:45 : Eisenhower decides invasion will be June 6 23:00 : All ships have received orders to resume sailing 24:00 : Convoys begin to form June 5 03:15 : Allied generals receive weather briefing 04:15 : Eisenhower makes final &quot; go &quot; decision 19:00 : Eisenhower visits American airborne troops 22:00 : Airborne forces don chutes , equipment 23:00 : Airborne troops take_off June 6 00:15 : Invasion begins as British paratroopers land 03:00 : Allies begin aerial bombardment 03:03 : Minesweepers finish sweeping water nearest the beaches 05:30 : Naval bombardment begins 06:30 : First landing , at Utah Beach BATTLE AT THE BEACHES The entire front , from Utah Beach in the west to Sword in the east , covers about 60 miles -- about the distance from Venice Beach to San Clemente . The famous beach code names identified with D-day didn ' t actually refer to beaches , but were names given to landing areas . Within each landing area were the assault beaches , where the troops landed . American Airborne After initial confusion , 13 # 000 troops secure vital roadways and villages that will help invasion move off Utah Beach ; they also provide flank protection . UTAH Strong current and poor visibility cause Americans to land in wrong sector but against light defenses . They quickly move inland and make contact with American airborne troops . OMAHA Americans engage in fiercest fighting of the day . Assault breaks_down as all but a_few first-wave troops land in wrong places . Attack take_place over a wide beach and heavily defended bluffs , and moves inland by noon . GOLD Armored forces , landing ahead of infantry , lose all but one tank . British move off beach and establish a five-square-mile lodgment but fail to connect with Americans on Omaha . JUNO Bitter opposition surprises Canadians , but by mid-morning they capture local village and set_up headquarters . Armored units arrive on_time ; contact is made with British . SWORD British secure beaches by 10 p.m. Contact with airborne further secures bridges to east . Only counterattack of day repulsed , shredding German tank division . British Airborne Just after midnight , 8 # 000 troops begin arriving East of Sword Beach . They quickly destroy some targets , capture key bridges and secure Eastern flank . Air_Forces Invasion succeeds in part because of air-space control over and around beaches . Allied air_forces have 8 # 000 combat aircraft ; Germans fewer than 500 . Allies fly 14 # 000 sorties , the Germans 250 -- mostly at action ' s fringes . Smoke on the Water Naval bombardment ends just before landings begin . Short duration of barrage and heavy fortification helps defending guns survive . Three-quarters of the warships are British . Not Even a Clue German defenders are unaware of huge invasion force until it is in front of them . Key factors : * Miserable weather * Bombing has destroyed much of German radar capability * Cloud_cover makes aerial reconnaissance difficult * Naval patrols are not dispatched due_to weather * Rommel , convinced that tides and weather are unfavorable , is in Germany No Tank Problem German panzers play no effective role . Only division nearby is sent east toward British airborne , then ordered to switch direction and counterattack north to gap between Juno and Sword beaches ; 13 tanks are immediately destroyed . When survivors withdraw , they have lost 70 of 124 tanks . &quot; BLOODY OMAHA &quot; : Americans Meet Savage Defense Americans encounter fiercest resistance of the day . All but a_few first-wave troops land in wrong places . Germans have the beach covered with everything from artillery to small arms from a honeycomb of strongpoints , gun pits and an extensive trench system . Allied intelligence fails to note presence of more and better trained troops than are expected . Omaha Gantlet First-wave invaders navigate rings of an Omaha hell -- covering more_than 200 yards of treacherous beach before running_into a concrete seawall . Enemy defenses claim 2 # 400 U.S. killed , wounded or missing in the first 24 hours . * Belgian gates : Seven-by-10-foot steel frames with waterproof mines carrying 12 pounds of TNT * Wooden stakes : Eight to 10 feet long , angled seaward , mined * Hedgehogs and ramps : Three six-foot steel bars welded together at their centers ; interspersed with wooden ramps that point toward shore . These ramps are designed to impale retreating landing_craft * Concrete seawall * Barbed wire * German gun positions : As part of the Atlantic Wall , the Germans built large coastal batteries , buried in the cliff tops . These are supplemented by fortified gun positions inland . Deadliest of the German guns , the 88-millimeter cannon is able to destroy tanks up_to 2 # 000 yards away . It is particularly lethal against troops when firing air-burst shells . 1 . American ships unload 11 miles offshore ; troops in boats four hours before landing , many becoming seasick . 2 . Tanks launched 5 # 000 yards off shore , 27 of 32 sink_in heavy seas ; 40 of 72 boats carrying artillery capsize . 3 . Many boats ground before reaching beach ; troops wearing 70 pounds of equipment jump into deep water and drown . 4 . On beach , wind and tide force landing boats together , allowing Germans to concentrate fire in small areas . 5 . Many wounded , unable to crawl faster than a swiftly rising tide , drown . 6 . Massive German cross-fire pins invaders behind obstacles ; one-third of engineers sent to clear lanes through obstacles are killed . Concrete seawall , first real protection , is in triple cross fire : machine_guns and artillery from sides , small arms from front , mortars overhead . * Sources : &quot; D-Day , June 6 , 1944 , The Climactic Battle of World_War_II , &quot; by Stephen Ambrose ; &quot; Decision in Normandy , &quot; by Carlo D ' Este ; &quot; Overlord , &quot; by Max Hastings ; &quot; The Longest Day , &quot; by Cornelius Ryan ; &quot; The Invasion of France and Germany , &quot; by Samuel Eliot Morison ; &quot; D-Day : Operation Overlord , &quot; Smithmark Publishers ; &quot; Illustrated History of World_War_II , &quot; The Reader ' s Digest Assn .
