   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRATS TAKE_AIM AT LONGTIME GOP STRONGHOLD ; POLITICS : WITH REAPPORTIONMENT AND NOLAN IN PRISON , GLENDALE-BASED ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEEMS UP FOR GRABS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Democrat in the Glendale-based 43rd District state Assembly seat ? Most years the idea of a breach in that Republican bastion would seem laughably quixotic , if not delusional . But that was before reapportionment , before Bill_Clinton and before veteran GOP incumbent Pat Nolan went_to prison . Now Democrats are daring to hope that a 33-year-old former prosecutor , endorsed by several law_enforcement groups , can wrest the 43rd District out of Republican hands with a platform that is tough on crime but moderate on hot-button social issues . Democrats also are drawing comfort from the recent disclosure that a front-running Republican , Municipal Judge James Rogan , is supported by the Allied Business PAC , a group noted for its ultraconservative , Christian fundamentalist agenda . &quot; It helps identify Rogan with fringe views , &quot; said one Democratic Party official . The situation worries some local GOP leaders as their party enters a confusing series of elections in the 43rd District this year to pick Nolan ' s successor . &quot; There was a time when Democrats would n ' t even file to run in this district , &quot; said Glendale City Councilman Larry Zarian , a local Republican leader and Rogan backer . &quot; But the old way of winning is over . Now we have to work hard. &quot; State Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) predicted recently that there is a good chance the Democratic Party would target the seat for party funding . &quot; Democrats are excited about our prospects in that district , &quot; said Katz , who represents an adjoining district . &quot; I think we have a good shot in November of taking this seat. &quot; On May 3 voters will go_to the polls to pick a successor to Nolan , who was forced to resign after pleading guilty Feb . 18 to a political racketeering charge . He is now serving a 33-month sentence in a federal prison_camp . If no one gets a majority in that election , the top vote-getters from each party will face each other in a June 28 special election . The winner of this set of elections will fill_out the remainder of Nolan ' s term , which expires Dec . 5 . In a separate , regular election cycle , the candidates will campaign in a June 7 primary and a Nov . 8 runoff for the two-year Assembly term that begins Dec . 5 . In the past , Republican hegemony was taken_for granted in the quiet suburban cities of Glendale and Burbank , the cornerstones of the 43rd District . But the 43rd District -- the bailiwick that produced Nolan , Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and U . S . Rep . Carlos Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) -- isn ' t what it used to be . Under the 1990 reapportionment plan , the district gained the Silver Lake and Los Feliz neighborhoods from the city of Los Angeles -- additions that eroded the GOP ' s historic registration advantage . Given the greater propensity of Republicans to vote , the district , with a registration that is now 43.3 % Democratic and 42 % GOP ( as opposed to 47 % Republican , 41 % Democratic before reapportionment ) is still considered Republican . Yet the GOP ' s grip on the 43rd District has slipped . In 1992 , Clinton carried the newly reconstituted 43rd District -- and even took the Glendale portion of it , where 2 out of 5 of its voters reside . That same year , Democratic senatorial candidates Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein also beat their GOP opponents in the district and the entrenched Moorhead won with only 49 % of the vote . The 43rd District , as Democratic political strategist Parke Skelton is fond of saying , is not Orange County . &quot; This is now a swing district , &quot; Skelton maintains , pointing to the fact that the Glendale and Burbank areas are increasingly populated by young renters , Latinos and Asians , who are more fertile ground for Democrats than the home-owning Anglos of yore . If these developments were not disconcerting enough to area Republicans , Nolan ' s surprise guilty plea suddenly left them without their beloved standard-bearer and frantically casting_about for his successor . Meanwhile , into this rapidly evolving political situation has stepped Democratic candidate Adam Schiff , 33 , a Harvard Law_School graduate who has been walking precincts since December when he quit his job as an assistant U . S . attorney to become a full-time candidate . Schiff , and his political handler , Skelton , believe 43rd District voters are anxious about crime , embarrassed by Nolan ' s involvement in the current wave of scandals in Sacramento and fed up with the divisive brand of partisanship practiced by their former assemblyman . If they are right , then a fresh-faced prosecutor like Schiff , armed with a pledge that he will seek bipartisan solutions to the state ' s problems , may go_far . Skelton also sees parallels between this year ' s 43rd District race -- especially if Rogan is the GOP candidate -- and the 1992 Assembly matchup between Venice attorney Debra Bowen , now the area ' s Democratic assemblywoman , and Redondo Beach mayor Brad Parton . Parton ' s ties to Christian fundamentalists helped alienate some voters and put Bowen over the top , contends Skelton , who ran Bowen ' s campaign and now sees a chance to resurrect some of its themes if Rogan , also backed by fundamentalists , is the GOP candidate in the 43rd District . But others doubt that there ' s a Republican crisis brewing in Glendale and Burbank . One of these is Steve Frank , former chairman of the California Republican Assembly , the state GOP ' s conservative wing . &quot; The Democrats are whistling past the graveyard on this one , &quot; Frank said . &quot; This seat is ours to lose , and we will lose_it if we go_to_sleep -- but I don ' t see that happening. &quot; Meanwhile , the GOP candidates are engaged in costly and bruising infighting . The top-ranked Republicans in the special election are Rogan , 36 , who has the support of many Nolan partisans , and Los Angeles Community_College District Trustee Julia Wu , 56 , a Silver Lake resident who beat incumbent Marguerite Archie-Hudson in 1987 . A third major GOP candidate is Peter Repovich , 36 , a Los Angeles Police_Department community relations officer . But Repovich , who has raised more_than $ 350 # 000 for his campaign , has opted to skip the special election with an eye toward concentrating his resources on the regular election . His war_chest so far is the largest among the Republican contenders . Repovich and Wu have teamed_up in their attacks on Rogan , accusing him of being a Johnny-come-lately to the Republican_Party . After being a Democratic Party activist for years , Rogan joined the GOP in 1988 and two years later was appointed to the bench by Republican Gov . George Deukmejian . Rogan ' s conversion has been labeled opportunistic by Repovich and Wu . &quot; He changed parties so he could get a judgeship , &quot; Wu has charged . Rogan denies it . &quot; I got tired_of being the odd man out_in the Democratic Party , and the Republicans were welcoming me with open arms , &quot; he said . &quot; Besides , I joined the party when ( 1988 Democratic presidential nominee ) Michael Dukakis was 17 points ahead in the polls against George_Bush . I hardly call that opportunistic. &quot; Rogan also proudly points to his support from the Allied Business PAC as a sign that the integrity of his philosophy and credentials has gotten the stamp of approval from rock-solid conservatives . Rogan opposes abortion rights , opposes most gun_control measures -- including bans on so-called assault_rifles -- supports a voucher program to help families pay_for private_school tuition , wants to see the National_Guard patrolling the U . S.-Mexico border to deter illegal entry and urges the abolition of conjugal visits and other privileges for prison inmates . Both Wu and Repovich support legalized abortion , although Wu says she would not support tax funding of abortions for the poor . Like Rogan , Wu and Repovich are opposed to limits on assault-weapon ownership , but unlike Rogan , they would support legislation -- now being pushed by Assemblyman Katz -- to make_it a felony to carry a concealed weapon . On crime and illegal immigration , the three are virtually indistinguishable hard-liners who call_for beefing_up patrols along the border , ending welfare benefits to illegal immigrants and meting out tougher treatment to violent criminals . While calling_for longer prison sentences , Wu is reluctant to spend more money on new prisons . &quot; We should not be building modern prisons for prisoners when we don ' t even have modern classrooms , &quot; she said . In his own crime spiel , Repovich , the police_officer , adds a dig at Rogan . &quot; We should lock ' em up and get_rid_of the soft , double-talking judges , &quot; he said recently . &quot; We pick them up , but it ' s the judges who let them go. &quot; Such campaign talk gives Skelton reason to hope that the Republican nominee -- whomever it might be -- will be weakened by intraparty squabbling . &quot; I ' m for as much democracy for the Republicans as possible , &quot; he quipped . Meanwhile , Schiff , who faces weaker primary opposition , is focusing his attention on the regular election . Skelton said he sees no advantage in being an incumbent for only a_few months and that Schiff should concentrate_on Rogan , who Skelton expects to be the GOP nominee in November . &quot; I think it ' s a frightening development that all this extremist money is coming_into the district , &quot; Schiff said last week after it was reported that Allied Business PAC is backing Rogan ' s campaign . The PAC and its principals -- four Republican millionaires , including savings and loan heir Robert Ahmanson and state Sen . Rob Hurtt ( R-Garden Grove ) -- have given $ 9 # 500 to Rogan ' s campaign so far , but are prepared to give much more if needed , a spokesperson for the group said last Thursday . In 1992 alone , the group gave $ 2.2 million to Republican candidates and conservative causes . Schiff , who ran in 1991 in a special election to fill the Hollywood-based seat vacated by retiring Assemblyman Mike Roos , is pro-abortion rights and would use tax dollars to fund abortions for the needy ; he supports banning assault weapons , and opposes a voucher system . &quot; I think the views of Mr. Rogan and the Allied Business PAC are way_out of step with this community , &quot; Schiff said .</TEXT>
