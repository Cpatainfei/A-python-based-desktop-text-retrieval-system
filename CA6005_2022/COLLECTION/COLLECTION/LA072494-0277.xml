   <HEADLINE> VALLEY IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC OF RECOVERY ; POLL : TIMES SURVEY FINDS THAT AFTER TWO YEARS OF GLOOM MANY BELIEVE THEY HAVE REACHED END OF DOWNWARD SLIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> San Fernando Valley residents -- those not chased out by lost jobs or scared_away by petty crooks and big-time earthquakes -- seem to be shaking_off the black mood that had spread and deepened in the sprawling Los Angeles suburb over the past two years . Life is not great , but it is getting better . That is the prevailing sentiment of Valley residents found in a Los Angeles Times Poll that probed feelings about neighborhoods , personal finances and the workplace -- areas where change has erased many longstanding notions about suburban life . &quot; I had expected lifetime employment , &quot; said Richard Wagner , 58 , of Van Nuys , a former aerospace_engineer who started his own graphic design business after being laid_off two years ago . &quot; I ' ve found now that I like to work for myself and I have a knack for the kind of work I do . But the financial impact is dramatic. &quot; Wagner used to earn $ 25 an hour . Now he makes between $ 6 and $ 10 an hour . &quot; I have different expectations today , &quot; he said , echoing others who have seen their lives and neighborhoods change dramatically over the past five years . &quot; Instead of retirement , I ' m going_to have to work one way or another until I drop , &quot; he said during an interview following his participation in the poll . &quot; that ' s OK . I ' m fine . I don ' t mind working. &quot; The Times poll , supervised by John Brennan , interviewed 1 # 094 adults living_in the Valley -- including the cities of San Fernando and Burbank -- on July 9 and 10 . The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage_points . The poll found that after surviving a wave of layoffs , business failures and dramatic declines in real_estate values , Valley residents are beginning to express cautious optimism about the area ' s financial prospects , despite the widespread pain that continues to be felt in many households . Far from an economic recovery , many Valley residents instead say they have reached the end of a downward slide . After four years of recession -- as well as several years of accelerated demographic and other social changes -- most say they have hit bottom and are now poised for a rebound . Despite lingering economic troubles for many , only 5 % of residents polled said they believe their finances will worsen in the next year , with 50 % saying they will improve and 40 % say they will probably remain about the same . Crime remains by far the main worry , but now fewer than half of Valley residents , 43 % , believe the quality_of_life in their community is going downhill , compared to 54 % who despaired over their neighborhood ' s prospects a little more_than a year ago . A total of 70 % now say they are satisfied with their neighborhoods , compared to 59 % reporting in an April , 1993 , Times poll . Looking ahead , 31 % say they think the Valley will not be in a recession next year . The growing optimism over finances and community comes despite the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , which caused major damage at 44 % of residents ' homes and apartments , according to The Times poll . About 30 % say they are worse off financially because of the quake . Even so , the shift to a more upbeat mood is broad-based , shared almost evenly by whites , Latinos , young , old , rich , poor , homeowner and renter . The mood is similar to the feelings of residents countywide , according to a countywide Times poll conducted last month . More people , 57 % , say they are making big purchases such_as cars , furniture , vacations and tuition . About 45 % of those polled said they have postponed buying because of financial troubles . The turnaround was dramatic for artist Andrew Totnan , 33 , a Studio City homeowner . &quot; Last year was my worst year and this year will probably turn_out to be my best , &quot; he said . Sales of his work , which range_in price from $ 200 to $ 6 # 000 , are suddenly at a record pace . Last year , with few buyers , Totnan said he considered returning to teaching , a profession he left to be a full-time artist . Now , he said , life is good . &quot; I have friends in different professions and it seems like most of them are doing better , that the economy is really picking_up , &quot; he said . For many others , however , there is only hope of financial recovery , and not much more . Despite economists ' claims to the contrary , 66 % still say they believe the Valley is in some kind of economic decline -- either a mild , moderate or serious recession . Last year , however , the figure was 80 % . Mohamad Barmaki , 47 , of Burbank says his finances haven ' t fallen much during the past few years . He buys , repairs and sells used cars for a living . But he still sees the effects of the recession on his customers . &quot; People are not as easy as they were before , &quot; he said . &quot; They are more into getting bargains . Some are really suffering. &quot; The recession and a changing economy has forced many businesses to trim payrolls and eliminate jobs . &quot; I don ' t see much dead wood out at the workplace these days , &quot; said Alan Darnell , 47 , of North Hollywood , who works as a temporary accountant at different firms . &quot; The people who are_on the job are really working . They ' re not just there to collect a paycheck. &quot; But for many caught in the campaign to cut costs , times are still tough . Two out of 10 Valley residents say the area remains in a serious recession , compared to 34 % in 1993 . And a substantial group , one-fifth of the Valley ' s population , remains stuck in a monthly struggle to pay rent , buy groceries and make car or insurance payments , according to The Times poll . &quot; In the last year and a half my hours were cut from 40 a week to 32 , and my husband has less work , &quot; said Roberta Rohwer , 43 , of Burbank . &quot; We were renting a house and now we ' re renting an apartment . . . . This year we couldn ' t go_on vacation . They shut_off the cable before Christmas and we haven ' t been able to get_it put_back on because there are too many other important things to pay_for , like electricity. &quot; Rohwer , who works in sales at the Ikea home furnishings store , said she has been taking night classes in child development at Valley College for the past two years . But she is discouraged now after learning that entry-level workers at child-care centers earn less than retail sales clerks . &quot; It doesn ' t seem we will be doing a heck of a lot better any time soon , &quot; said the Burroughs High_School graduate . &quot; It ' s just frustrating. &quot; For job losses , the worst may be over . This month , 16 % report they or someone in their household was fired in the last 12 months , compared to 23 % in April last year . The total proportion of Valley households affected by lost jobs , work or income fell to 34 % from 43 % in April of last year . Among those who lost work_through staff cuts , the proportion dropped to 23 % , compared to 37 % last year . Also , fewer families who lost jobs are blaming the recession , 22 % , compared to 42 % who said that was the reason last year . Valley residents as a group apparently value education , an investment that is consistently made among all income groups , according to the poll . Of households making major purchases in the past year , tuition is second only to vehicle purchase among those earning $ 20 # 000 and less a year . Of Valley residents who postponed major purchases , more said they deferred buying cars , furniture , vacations and appliances before postponing tuition . For many , education is the route to regaining lost ground after losing a job in the past two or three years . Often , that means learning a new trade or new skills . Most of the 34 % who say they have gone_to school or taken training to improve or learn new careers say the extra work has paid_off . Schooling landed Robert Broadway a job in computer software engineering . But at age 32 , he has already been laid_off twice in his career and seen his annual income drop $ 16 # 000 after his last job change . This is not what he expected after following his father ' s footsteps into the computer_business , said the El Camino Real High_School graduate . His dad , Broadway said , has been out_of_work for more_than a year . Laid-off aerospace workers , many with advanced college degrees , have flooded the market , making_it especially difficult for younger , less experienced workers , Broadway said . Despite the uncertainties of his business , though , Broadway said he is better_off than when he was working as a car mechanic . He got_out of that career after he attended Pierce College and completed courses at an electronics trade_school . His first big break came when he was hired by a firm servicing electronic_equipment for local Fortune 500 companies . &quot; They were paying $ 36 an hour , &quot; Broadway said . &quot; Then three years ago I got laid_off . They had to downsize because they were mostly servicing aerospace companies. &quot; Four months later , Broadway found another job , this one paying $ 11 an hour in the technical support division of computer-maker Packard Bell Electronics Inc. &quot; Technical support is not a high-paying job , &quot; he said . &quot; But there are always openings . It ' s the drudge job of the computer industry. &quot; Then after the Jan . 17 earthquake , he was laid_off again , only to be rehired two weeks later in the company ' s software engineering division . Now , he said , he is not taking any more chances . &quot; I ' m back in school , taking classes in advanced computer software , &quot; he said . &quot; As technology becomes more powerful , computers will support more advanced programs and so people who write advanced programs will be more and more in_demand . To stay alive in this industry , you have to read what is going_on in three or four years. &quot; Reflecting the changing nature of the workplace , 58 % of those employed report earning better salaries than they were paid five years ago . But only 31 % report improvements in benefits such_as health_insurance and vacation pay , while 20 % say they are worse . About 26 % of Valley residents who work say they receive no benefits at all , 16 % say their income fell_over the past five years and 23 % say it is about the same . Considering everything , 51 % of Valley workers say their job or business is better than it was five years ago , 23 % say it is worse and 24 % say it is about the same . However , 86 % say they are satisfied with their jobs . The majority of Valley residents , 74 % , describe their finances as secure , up a bit from a year ago , and higher than residents polled this spring countywide , 66 % , and statewide , 63 % . A total of 28 % say they are having trouble paying their rent or mortgage . Alfred Tutungi , 38 , whose Sylmar townhouse suffered extensive damage during the earthquake , is one of the people whose housing costs have become a burden . While waiting for insurance adjusters and his neighbors to agree on how to proceed with repairs , Tutungi must pay to rent another place to live , as well as support his wife and newborn baby . &quot; It was tough before and now it ' s worse , &quot; said Tutungi , a child-care director at a city-run center in North Hollywood . &quot; ( Home ) prices had fallen enough already , and now the earthquake on top of it. &quot; Homes have become a burden rather than an asset for 20 % . That is roughly the same proportion of Valley homeowners who bought their houses or condominiums in the years 1988 through 1991 , the peak of the area ' s real_estate market , according to the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors . But 72 % of Valley homeowners consider their properties an asset . That is also about the same proportion who have owned their homes more_than six years and , presumably , still have some equity despite the fall_in prices , now back to 1988 levels . Next year , 27 % of homeowners say they believe the value of their property will go_up , with half saying it will probably stay the same . Former homeowner Leslie Dimattia has seen both extremes of the Valley economy . She and her ex-husband built a pizza chain of 24 stores in five states during the 1980s , then went bankrupt in 1991 . &quot; It was a nice ride , you know , trips to Maui , live-ins , donating money , not having to think_about what this or that cost , &quot; said Dimattia , 41 , who figures she and her ex-husband ended_up owing about $ 8 million at the end . Now she works as a waitress in a Tarzana coffee_shop . She and her two children live_in a rented Van Nuys house , creditors having long ago taken her home_in Sherman Oaks . &quot; It ' s rough , but the silver_lining is that the kids are getting_in_touch with budgeting , something they never had to think_about , &quot; Dimattia said of her children , ages 8 and 14 . &quot; But they remember the Hawaii trips , private_schools and going shopping for clothes . Here in Van Nuys you have gang members on one side and crack dealers on the other . One good_part , the princess in my daughter had to disappear. &quot; Assistant Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus contributed to this story . Economic Poll Findings San Fernando Valley residents , after surviving a lingering recession and a major earthquake , say life is not great , but it ' s getting better .
