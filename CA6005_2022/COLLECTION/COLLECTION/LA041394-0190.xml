   <TEXT> Former Venezuelan soccer star Cheche Vidal hung_up his cleats years ago , but when the World Cup soccer championship -- the most-watched sporting event on the planet -- kicks_off this summer , he ' ll have a lot more on his mind than winning a game . Vidal is vice_president of technology for World Cup USA 1994 Inc. He is in_charge of what is perhaps the most advanced computer and telecommunications_system yet designed for a sporting event . World Cup USA 1994 , the Los Angeles-based organizer of this year ' s soccer championship , is responsible_for bringing the playoff to the United States for the first time . The 52-match series begins June 17 at stadiums in nine cities across the country . Seven of the games , including the final one , will be played_at the Rose Bowl . Behind the four-week championship will be a computer_system that uses the latest technology , including computer networking , multimedia and high-speed fiber-optic communications . Designing the system was a considerable challenge to World Cup officials . &quot; No one was prepared_for the staggering dimension of the job of generating a working environment for an event the size of the World Cup championships , &quot; Vidal said . According to Vidal , the system will be used by about 50 # 000 people as an aid to daily administration and operations -- for tasks such_as the instant dispensing of photo identification passes to players , coaches , referees and World Cup employees . One of the most far-reaching applications of the computer_system will be the World Cup News Service . Designed for the use of the 3.6 million ticket holders , as well as the 7 # 500 to 10 # 000 journalists who will cover the matches , it is intended to be an easy-to-use source of timely information about the games , statistics , rules and players ' biographies . The system ' s database will also contain historical data on the 64-year-old World Cup and the 3 # 000 games and 20 # 000 players that have participated in the quadrennial competition . The computers will also be linked to closed-circuit TV that will feed statistics to broadcasters during the games . You don ' t have to go_to the game to get_to the information , though . The general public will have access to it via the CompuServe network . The World Cup ' s computer_system blends technology from some of the most prominent suppliers : The computers are_on loan from Sun Microsystems Inc. , and telecommunications giant Sprint International will provide the fiber-optic communications to link up the international network . Two Sun SparcCenter 2000 servers -- computers that serve as the main repository of data and software for the system -- in Dallas will anchor the network . Systems integrator EDS -- Ross Perot ' s former firm -- designed the system and wrote some of its most critical software . All three of the firms are marketing partners of the World Cup , as are several other companies . In exchange for donations of $ 5 million each , they ' ll receive special advertising and promotional benefits . &quot; With their partnership , we ' ve been able to capitalize on the most advanced of established technology , &quot; said Bill Alaoglu , assistant vice_president of technology for World Cup USA . The World Cup ' s system will have about 1 # 000 computer workstations distributed among approximately 50 smaller networks in the nine host cities . But because of the &quot; distributed computing &quot; technology used , every computer user will have access to any item of data or software program in the system , whether the information is in a computer across the room or across the country . A system of this sort is nothing unusual in the halls of big business , but the logistic demands of the World Cup nevertheless made this project unusually tricky . One problem was time . &quot; We have to put_up a nationwide and international information_system , but instead of having three years to describe the system and two years to develop it , we ' ve had to get the whole_thing up and running in a year and a half , &quot; Alaoglu said . Space was another challenge . The World Cup ' s host cities -- Los Angeles , San Francisco , Dallas , Chicago , Detroit , Boston , New York , Washington and Orlando -- are in four time_zones . The system also had to be linked with soccer ' s international parent organization , the Zurich-based Federation Internationale de Football . Already , about half of the system -- or about 500 workstations -- is in place . But the rest can ' t go_up until the stadiums and other hotel and office spaces are free , and that won ' t happen until the last minute . &quot; We ' re going to have as little as 10 days to set_up the office_buildings , physically lay cabling for the computer_networks and deploy 500 more workstations , &quot; said Bud Bencic , the EDS account_executive on the World Cup project . World Cup officials expect that 1.6 billion people -- nearly a third of the world population -- will watch the final game on July 17 in Pasadena .</TEXT>
