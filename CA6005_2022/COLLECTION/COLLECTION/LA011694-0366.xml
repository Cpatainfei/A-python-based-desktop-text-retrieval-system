   <HEADLINE> WHITEWATER : WHEN SCANDAL SEEMS AS STYLIZED AS KABUKI ; POLITICS : WASHINGTON HAS SHIFTED INTO DAMAGE-CONTROL HIGH_GEAR . BUT CAN ANYONE IDENTIFY WHAT IS WRONG ? OR IS THIS SMOKING GUN JUST SMOKE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Act One of the Whitewater scandal ended last week on a disorderly note . President Bill_Clinton , in the midst of his Eastern European trip , suddenly decided to accept political reality and ask the attorney_general to appoint a special counsel to conduct an inquiry . At the same time , in an attempt to escalate hostilities , Senate Republican leader Bob Dole charged that Congress ' regular Democratic leadership could not be trusted to probe the mess and called_for the establishment of special Senate and House committees . But the President ' s announcement stepped all_over Dole ' s lines . Congressional Democrats , gratefully seizing_on the President ' s surrender , stoutly resisted the Republican call_for Iran-Contra-style hearings . So Clinton did a prudent thing . But from a scientific point_of_view , his announcement was too_bad , because the Washington community was_on the verge of acting_out the following thought experiment : If in today ' s Andy Warhol world you can now be famous for being famous , can you also be guilty of being thought guilty ? How far can the scandal process go before someone finally has to say just what the accused official is guilty of ? Our political scandals have now become as stylized as Kabuki . There is the character of the High Official , brought low by long-ago sins . The Opposition Leader , pressing the scandal forward as far and fast as possible . The Inquiring Journalist , nobly enraged by lack of access to documents . The smooth Damage Controller . The Shady Character from the High Official ' s past . Have we gotten so good that we no longer need any substantive information to keep the drama going ? The Whitewater dance was_on the verge of supplying some answers to this question . As of a month ago , what we generally knew about Whitewater was that : ( a ) the First Couple had some savings-and-loan connections that could signify either foul crimes or just garden-variety Southern friends-and-neighbors politics ; ( b ) a lot of papers were missing , and ( c ) a close Clinton aide in the White_House had committed a surprising suicide several months before . This was not a whole_lot -- and not much more of a fundamental nature has emerged since then . Instead , the current scandal burst_upon us for reasons that were formal and technical . First , in late December it became public that after Vincent W . Foster Jr. ' s death , papers in his office concerning the Clintons ' personal_business affairs had not been given to investigators . Thus , the charge of cover-up -- which , in turn , was taken_to imply that there must be something to hide . Next , the media community had just been jolted by the trooper scandal , in which Arkansas police gave details of the President ' s past sexual exploits during his days as governor . Since the late 1980s , opinion-makers had grown increasingly queasy about their role in spreading such tales . And if there was any sex scandal to upset the faint of stomach , it was the trooper stories : They described highly private behavior , most already known in outline to the electorate that voted Clinton into the presidency in 1992 . By contrast , over there , shimmering on the horizon , was the aptly named Whitewater scandal : a nice , clean scandal , fit for prime-time and family newspapers . By pursuing Whitewater , you could avert your eyes from the troopers ' tales , yet show you were not a Clinton patsy . Thus , the burst of media enthusiasm for James B . McDougal and his Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was , in part , a great , windy sigh of relief . So here we were , in the Washington political audience , with our newly intensified interest in -- well , we still didn ' t know exactly what . But the Clintons , bless them , kept us going_with their not-atypical evasiveness and their inexplicable insistence that Whitewater fell inside some sacrosanct &quot; zone of privacy &quot; where the press had no right to tread . This claim had approximately the same effect as stamping a document &quot; Top Secret Unbelievably Classified One Eye Only. &quot; Media enthusiasm was sustained . If everyone had continued to play his or her role as written , the next steps might have gone like this : Dole calls_for select committee to investigate Whitewater . Committee appointed . Editorial opinion massively in favor of independent investigation . Congress quickly reauthorizes independent counsel . Independent counsel appointed . Independent counsel in clash with committee over issues of subpoenas , witness immunity . Reporter from Arkansas Stiletto finds witness alleging he saw Mrs . C . receiving cash_in brown paper_bags . Witness testifies . Insurance , pharmaceutical industries attack First_Lady as profiteer . Whitewater documents turn_up in abandoned car in Little_Rock parking_lot . OK , this is a somewhat fanciful version of the future -- but not by much . Most Americans still do not care much about Whitewater , any more_than they cared about those shocked Arkansas troopers . Yet , among the chattering classes , the Clintons are profoundly vulnerable . In his case , deep doubts persist about whether he is a President -- strong , stable , and capable -- or an amiable kid . In her case , the situation is more poisonous . Hillary Rodham Clinton has become , for reasons not all_of her own making , a dramatically polarizing public figure . She has many admirers . But her enemies are bitter . One measure of this is the gleeful snickering you hear around Washington as it becomes clearer that she , rather than her husband , played the major role in the couple ' s relationship with Madison Guaranty . These are the sorts of people who lie_in_wait . So perhaps it is not so surprising that in the Whitewater matter , a modest tendril of scandal smoke quickly turned_into the monster blaze that ate Oakland . Still , the rapid development of this scandal tells as much about our system of political communication as it does about the Clintons . We simply do not need much fuel any more to get ourselves going . With just a small piece of encouragement , we are capable of attaining critical mass and becoming self-sustaining in our production of scandal energy . For the moment , Clinton has pulled the rods out of the reactor . His acceptance of a special prosecutor has heartened his own party . It gives his people another justification for not making the Whitewater documents more public . The special prosecutor ' s scope and reporting requirements are not clear and may be subject_to negotiation . The investigation will drive the case underground for some period_of_time . But the President ' s reprieve can only be contingent and temporary . Rep . Jim Leach ( ( R-Iowa ) , who has been pursuing the Madison matter , is fighting with the Office of Thrift Supervision about access to that agency ' s documents . At the Office of Professional Responsibility , the investigation into Foster ' s death is , as they say , widening . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . is investigating Hillary Clinton ' s law_firm to see whether she and her colleagues misled regulators . Washington has never given a clearer demonstration of the fact that it is an exceedingly dangerous place .</TEXT>
