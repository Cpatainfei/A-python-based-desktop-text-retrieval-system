   <TEXT> More_than 900 soldiers from countries on both sides of the former Iron_Curtain are in Poland this week , taking_part in the first military exercises between NATO troops and soldiers of the now-defunct Warsaw Pact . The five-day training_program is getting under way today at Biedrusko , a village north of Poznan in western Poland.It is the initial field operation of NATO ' s Partnership for Peace program , which was created last year to provide military_training and planning among North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization countries and non-NATO members in Eastern Europe . The soldiers come from 13 countries , including the United States , but there are no participants from Russia , which reluctantly joined the partnership program this summer but remains wary of NATO ' s intentions toward the former Soviet Bloc countries .</TEXT>
