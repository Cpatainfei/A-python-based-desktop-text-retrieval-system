   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : GENETIC PROFILING COULD MAKE DNA VIOLENT CRIME ' S WORST ENEMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Three strikes , you ' re out &quot; felony sentencing and Brady bill gun_control may win the political popularity_contests , but they ' re not the breakthroughs that will deter violent crime . There is an innovation , however , that could have an enormous impact in identifying , capturing , convicting and deterring violent criminals . After a scandal arising from improper lab practices , this technology is now quietly but relentlessly moving through America ' s justice system . Where it ' s used , it works . Within a decade , every community that cares about fighting crime will revise its laws and build new databases accordingly . Genetic profiling -- the use of biotechnology to identify the unique characteristics of an individual ' s DNA -- is about to become as prevalent as the Breathalyzer and more important than the fingerprint . Genetic profiling used to be called genetic fingerprinting , but for reasons of technical precision and political correctness , the forensic criminologists opted for the kinder , gentler description of the technique . With but a single hair , a dandruff flake , a skin sliver beneath the fingernails , a gobbet of spit or any other bodily_fluid , crime lab investigators today can positively identify -- or completely clear -- a suspect based on the idiosyncrasies of that individual ' s DNA . With polymerase chain-reaction technology , a Nobel Prize-winning technique that amplifies minute strands of DNA , &quot; criminal investigators will soon be able to identify individuals off the butt of a cigarette they smoked , &quot; predicts Victor McKusick , the Johns Hopkins medical geneticist who chaired a National Academy of Sciences panel on forensic DNA matching . McKusick ' s panel last year concluded that although gene profiling needs rigorous monitoring , it is a valid and reliable technology that should become a part of the criminal justice system . The challenges today are no longer technical ; instead they lie_in taking the technology and building a meaningful legal infrastructure around it . That means that every violent felon in America ( including juveniles ) must be required to submit to DNA sampling -- a drop of blood or a saliva swab -- just as they are now required to submit to fingerprinting and mug_shots . Every state in the nation must be required to participate in the support of local and national DNA databases to quickly identify violent criminals . It should be a national crime policy goal that a police_department anywhere in the country should be able to run a DNA match tomorrow as quickly , casually and cost-effectively as it can run a license_plate check today . &quot; The DNA technology is going_to allow us to develop evidence for the courts , both the prosecution and the defense , far better than we have ever been able to do before , &quot; says Paul Ferrara , director of Virginia ' s Division of Forensic Science , which built one of the country ' s first gene-profiling facilities . &quot; In fact , we ' re exonerating suspects in 25 % to 30 % of cases . . . . Even today , our police are much more aware of preservation of the crime scene . . . . The success rate we have going from the laboratory with evidence is going_to increase dramatically. &quot; Currently , fewer than half the states have laws requiring DNA sampling from violent felons . Many of the states restrict sampling primarily to sexual_assaults . What ' s more , states have only just begun to set_up their own DNA databases to record criminal profiles . &quot; Only about half_a_dozen states now have functioning databanks , &quot; Ferrara acknowledges . California and many other states have not moved nearly as quickly as they should have or could have to build their DNA databases . What ' s more , DNA database sharing between states is inadequate , although the FBI has taken a strong lead in facilitating standard-setting and cooperation with state labs for this emerging forensic technology . &quot; All of the state databanks are being constructed using the same technology so that data can be exchanged between them , &quot; says John W . Hicks , director of the FBI ' s crime laboratory . &quot; We ' re doing about 2 # 500 profiles a year right now . . . . In a_few years , it should be in the tens of thousands. &quot; The technology has already begun to pay_off . Within the last six months , several states recorded their first &quot; cold hits &quot; off the databases . That is , by finding a DNA sample at the scene of the assault , investigators were able to match it with a DNA sequence already stored in the database . In cases involving sexual predators or child_molesters , such DNA databases are indispensable . Hicks estimates there could be more_than 20 # 000 profiles of sex offenders in digital DNA databases by this time next year . But when one considers how difficult it is for a criminal not to leave some organic trace of himself or herself at the scene of a violent crime -- or even an ordinary robbery -- it should be immediately clear that this technology radically increases the opportunities for criminal identification and capture . &quot; In five years , &quot; says Ferrara , &quot; databank hits should be commonplace. &quot; The economics of these techniques are also favorable . Computer matching is cheap and , as biotechnology improves , the costs of DNA sampling could fall from roughly $ 200 a test today to less than $ 50 by the end of the decade . In the interest of justice and fairness , every effort must be taken_to assure that these technologies are completely valid . It ' s unfortunate that there has been no technical coordination , for example , between the multibillion-dollar Human Genome Initiative and the forensic DNA programs of the FBI . &quot; The Human Genome Project could be helpful in addressing some of the kinds of technical statistical issues that have come_up in terms of populations , &quot; acknowledges the FBI ' s Hicks . &quot; It could help do_away_with a lot of the polemics on how unique certain DNA sequences are. &quot; The rise of forensic DNA is hardly_a panacea for crime-weary Americans . On the other hand , it presents the most credible opportunity for stripping security and anonymity away from those who commit criminal acts . Criminal behavior may_not be genetic . But criminals will be betrayed by their own DNA at the scene or on the weapon of a crime .</TEXT>
