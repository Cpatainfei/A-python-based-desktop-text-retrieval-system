   <HEADLINE> S . KOREA , U.S. PLAN U.N. STEPS ON N . KOREAN SANCTIONS ; DIPLOMACY : GRADUAL APPROACH IS INTENDED TO EASE CHINESE RESISTANCE TO A STRONG STAND ON INSPECTION OF NORTH ' S NUCLEAR SITES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and South_Korea agreed Wednesday on a gradual , step-by-step strategy to overcome Chinese resistance to U.N. Security_Council sanctions against North_Korea over its suspected nuclear_weapons program . &quot; I think it is unlikely the Chinese will veto the kind of resolution we are working_on right now , &quot; South_Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo said after a 50-minute meeting with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . Later at the United Nations , in what many took as a sign that the strategy might be working , China proposed that the Security_Council president issue a statement calling_on North_Korea to submit to inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency . Such a statement would carry less weight than a formal resolution , but it would put the council -- and China -- on record . Under U.N. rules , presidential statements must have the unanimous support of the 15-member council . Although the United States , Britain , France and Russia -- the permanent members of the Security_Council along with China -- clearly would prefer a resolution , a senior U.S. official described the Chinese action as &quot; a sign that on content they are moving_in the same direction as we are. &quot; The official said Washington and its allies have not yet decided whether to go_along with China ' s proposal or to continue pushing for a resolution . But he said the proposed statement &quot; says a lot of good things and has the Chinese on board. &quot; The dispute with the North_Koreans escalated this year after Pyongyang refused to allow international inspections of nuclear facilities under the requirements of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The IAEA has been trying to determine whether North_Korea is diverting plutonium that comes_out of its nuclear_power plants for use in nuclear bombs . The United States hopes to persuade Beijing , a North_Korean ally , to support mild Security_Council criticism of Pyongyang , on the assumption that China would then be less likely to veto a stronger resolution later if North_Korea spurns the council ' s request . The council may act_as early as today on a statement or a resolution requiring North_Korea to go_along with the inspections . If , after a reasonable time , the North_Koreans fail to comply , the council would consider economic sanctions . Although Christopher has predicted that China would not block U.N. action against North_Korea , Chinese officials repeatedly have opposed sanctions , calling instead for &quot; dialogue &quot; with Pyongyang . Foreign Minister Han briefed Christopher in Washington after talks in Beijing between Chinese officials and South_Korean President Kim Young Sam . Han went_to the United Nations later Wednesday . &quot; The Chinese are_on board in the sense of discussing the form and the content of the Security_Council measure , &quot; Han said . &quot; We ' re still talking . There ' s no conclusion as_to which way it would go . We are fairly certain about the content of either ( a resolution or a statement ) and that means there would be certain minimum requirements. &quot; Christopher said the United States and South_Korean positions &quot; are completely congruent. &quot; Wednesday evening in San Diego , where he is vacationing , President Clinton declined to speculate on the chances that the Security_Council will adopt a resolution . &quot; I ' ll just say that we and the South_Koreans are exploring with all_the relevant parties what our options are , &quot; he told reporters . He was also cautious in predicting the Chinese response on the issue . &quot; we ' ll have to see where China comes_down on it in the end , &quot; he said . State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry conceded that the U.S. strategy could take time . But he said that a delay may be necessary to ensure Chinese acquiescence . &quot; In a very deliberate , careful way , in a step-by-step way , ( the Security_Council ) will begin to make clear the international community ' s determination to successfully resolve the North_Korean issue , &quot; he said . North_Korea insists its nuclear facilities are for peaceful purposes . But Kim Il Sung ' s regime has repeatedly blocked international inspections . McCurry said the IAEA must try to determine , based on information it has been able to gather , whether North_Korea has an active nuclear_weapons program . Such a finding , he said , would have &quot; grave consequences. &quot; In recent weeks , North_Korea ' s formidable propaganda apparatus has threatened war if the West invokes sanctions . Officials in both Washington and Seoul have said the North_Korean threats are a cause for concern but that the West should not change policy because of them .
