   <HEADLINE> EX-FARRAKHAN AIDE BRINGS HIS WAR OF WORDS TO L.A. ; RACE : KHALLID ABDUL MUHAMMAD ' S STATEMENTS ABOUT BLACKS , JEWS AND ARABS HAVE BEEN DENOUNCED NATIONWIDE AS VENOMOUS INCITEMENTS TO HATRED . HE CALLS HIMSELF A ' TRUTH TERRORIST. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He says he ' s a teacher . He says he ' s at war . But most black_and_white leaders tend to describe Khallid Abdul Muhammad with words like these : repugnant , vile , anti-Semitic . Muhammad , the 43-year-old former senior aide to Louis Farrakhan , head of the Nation of Islam , became more controversial than his mentor for remarks at a Nov . 29 speech at Kean College in New Jersey . He said that Jews and Arabs were &quot; the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the black community. &quot; He called Pope John Paul II a &quot; cracker &quot; ; he suggested that Jewish people brought_on the Holocaust themselves . Now he has come_to Los Angeles , where he grew_up and where he will speak Saturday night -- his first address here since the speech that made him infamous . In an interview Thursday , with his 9-year-old son , Farrakhan Khallid Muhammad , constantly at his side in a borrowed office in the Crenshaw district , Muhammad reflected on his critics . There are many . Not only was his speech denounced by the President , the Congressional Black Caucus , the Rev . Jesse Jackson , and leading black and Jewish leaders , but Farrakhan himself was forced to reprimand Muhammad and suspend him from his duties as a top aide and spokesman . &quot; He said my speech was vile in manner , repugnant , malicious , mean-spirited , and spoken in mockery of individuals and people and not in the spirit of Islam . I will never forget those words , &quot; Muhammad said . &quot; I feel very hurt over those words , to be honest. &quot; ( Adding_to the controversy , however , Farrakhan said he agreed with the basic truths of what Muhammad had said -- just not the way he said it. ) Muhammad , who will speak Saturday night at the Vison Complex theater in the Crenshaw district and Sunday at UC Riverside , gives an average of five speeches a week , for what he says is an average honorarium of $ 10 # 000 a speech . And his usual topic is the &quot; black holocaust , &quot; the sufferings of blacks for centuries , before , during and after the American slave_trade . Where it gets incendiary is when he begins to compare it to the World_War_II Holocaust , saying that oppression of blacks has taken far more lives . The Anti-Defamation League is among his most vocal critics . &quot; I don ' t see what ' s to be gained by relativizing human tragedy , &quot; said David Lehrer , regional director here of the Anti-Defamation League . &quot; It ' s pernicious . . . . My hope is that Khallid Abdul Muhammad doesn ' t speak_for many black people . He is a divisive separatist who spews forth venom in every direction . Good people in all communities have and will continue to reject the blandishments of this bigot. &quot; Muhammad does not disavow any of his Kean College remarks , and is likely to touch_on the same themes here . In fact , like a politician on the campaign trail , he uses phrases again and again . &quot; I ' m a truth terrorist , I ' m a knowledge gangster , &quot; he often says . On Saturday night , he promises , &quot; I will name the names of the Jews in all_of the major networks who have great control and influence over all_the negative images of blacks in movies and television and the media in general. &quot; Ask him why he measures which is worse , black suffering or the Holocaust , and he replies without raising his voice , &quot; That is such a ridiculous question to ask me . We never made_it an issue . It ' s the so-called Jews who make_it an issue . . . . The Jews believe they have a corner on suffering. &quot; The venom and vitriol of most of his speeches tend to overshadow any lessons about black oppression that he has to offer . But he doesn ' t really care who is offended . White , Jewish , Catholic , Arab critics -- they ' re among the oppressors of blacks . Black critics are brainwashed or &quot; house niggers. &quot; All this is said calmly , quietly during the interview . In speeches , he is commanding , theatrical . But here , he rarely raises his voice . He is articulate , if sometimes given to making small speeches that quote a blur of sources from historical writings to the Bible . He arrives with an entourage of security , but his son is his most ardent observer . Farrakhan listens raptly , scrutinizing his father and his father ' s interviewer . He stands when his father is ready to leave , gets papers for him from his bag when his father requests them . Muhammad , who is divorced from his son ' s mother , refers to her only as a member of the Nation of Islam , &quot; a very brilliant African queen. &quot; Muhammad is reluctant to reveal many of the details of his life or boyhood in Los Angeles . He spent his childhood between Texas -- where he was born Harold Moore Vann -- and Los Angeles , where he still has close ties . He says he has a doctorate in sociology but he declines to name the university where he earned it , saying his Ph.D. from a white institution means little to him . ( Other news accounts say he attended Dillard University in New Orleans , and put his age at 48. ) He does say that he grew disenchanted with traditional academia and eventually took_up the work of the Nation of Islam after meeting Farrakhan in New Orleans in 1967 . In 1988 , while living_in Atlanta , Muhammad was convicted of using a false Social_Security_number on a home mortgage loan_application , and served one year in prison . He now lives_in New York and spends most of his time traveling and making speeches . If they offend people , he says , so be it . &quot; If you ' re at war , you ' re supposed to attack your enemies . It ' s arrogant to tell the aggrieved , to tell the victim , to tell the survivor of the African holocaust how to suffer or how to talk. &quot;</TEXT>
