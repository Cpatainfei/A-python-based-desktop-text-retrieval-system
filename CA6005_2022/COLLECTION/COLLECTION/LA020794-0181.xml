   <HEADLINE> WILL BORDER BUILDUP BE EFFECTIVE ? ; IMMIGRATION : PATROL SAYS HUNDREDS MORE AGENTS , HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT WILL DETER ILLEGAL ENTRY . BUT HISTORY OF NEGLECT AND ABUSES TEMPER THE ENTHUSIASM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. Border_Patrol has long been regarded_as the blue-collar underdog of law_enforcement . Agents drive battered vehicles . Radios fail during pursuits . Lack of personnel in San Diego forces agents into tedious tasks such_as interviewing lines of prisoners being returned to Tijuana -- often the same faces night after night . In an effort to end the frustration and anarchy at the border , the immigration control initiative announced by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno last week will send unprecedented reinforcements to San Diego : a 40 % increase in the 1 # 000-agent contingent combined with sorely needed new technology . &quot; These physical improvements and the increase of agents will give us a considerable degree of control that we don ' t have now , &quot; said William T . Veal , deputy chief of the Border_Patrol ' s San Diego sector . &quot; Our end goal is deterrence . We achieve that by ensuring that anybody who tries to enter illegally will be caught. &quot; The buildup will deter would-be illegal immigrants and redirect the flow_away from a region that records half of all border arrests , Border_Patrol commanders say . Less optimistic observers say the Clinton_Administration acceded_to only a moderate buildup in response to political pressure . &quot; It ' s not enough , &quot; an immigration official said . &quot; They are going_to have to do more. &quot; Memories of neglect temper the enthusiasm among agents . &quot; Everybody ' s just kind of waiting and watching , &quot; said Border_Patrol spokeswoman Ann Summers . &quot; It ' s a big , big move_in the right direction . As much as has been promised to us in the past , when we actually start seeing it is when we are going_to see the highest morale. &quot; The plan has also renewed fears about the potential for abuse by an agency with a record of misconduct cases and allegations . For U.S. and Mexican migrant advocates , the acquittal in Arizona on Thursday of a Border_Patrol agent who shot an unarmed suspect in the back served as an ironic counterpoint to the attorney_general ' s announcement . But Justice_Department officials intend to avoid the hiring rushes of the past that allowed dubiously qualified agents to slip through . Doris Meissner , the new commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service , is emphasizing better screening , training and discipline , and creating a citizens advisory panel . Avoiding past mistakes is crucial , according to experts . Although new resources will unquestionably worsen the odds for illegal crossers , the volatile confrontation at the international line will continue between a growing paramilitary police_force on one side and determined migrants on the other . &quot; It depends not only on the number of the agents but on the mentality of the agents , &quot; said Victor Clark Alfaro , director of the Bi-National Center for Human_Rights in Tijuana . &quot; As crossing becomes more difficult , that makes people desperate . The irritation among the migrants is created not only by the presence of Border_Patrol agents but by the smugglers , the presence of robber gangs . This mix creates tension. &quot; The two-year INS plan includes an already appropriated $ 45 million package for this year aimed at shutting_down the main corridors of illegal immigration . The patrol will deploy 620 additional agents in San Diego and El Paso , which together recorded three-quarters of border arrests last year . An additional 400 San Diego agents -- including about 100 existing agents who will be relieved from support duties by new civilian workers -- will be divided among three border stations and a planned roving unit , Veal said . Unlike last year ' s border blockade in El Paso , which fielded a massive show of force overnight , the increase in San Diego will unfold gradually as classes graduate from the patrol ' s academy . To ensure that agents are properly equipped , the government will supply 200 more vehicles in San Diego , improved infrared detection devices and motion sensors , and new radios designed to prevent eavesdropping by smugglers of drugs and immigrants . &quot; Some of the technology we ' ve found on smugglers made us look_like we were playing with toys , &quot; Summers said . The fortification of The Line , as the boundary is known among agents , will accelerate . The patrol will build a second fence behind the existing 10-foot metal barrier on a barren stretch of terrain known as Otay Mesa , creating a 50-yard-wide corridor in which agents can trap illegal crossers . High-intensity lights are being installed along the 14-mile strip of canyons and mesas . An existing mile of lights and double and triple fences have reduced crossings and violence along the Tijuana River . Under the plan , commanders also hope to eliminate one of the job ' s most curious and tedious rituals , in which agents must return to their stations to conduct brief interviews with dozens of weary captured migrants . After the paperwork is complete , the prisoners are then returned voluntarily to Tijuana , where many turn_around and cross again . Bilingual civilian employees will take_over routine processing duties , freeing_agents to spend more time in the field . &quot; I want to have those forms filled_out by civilians rather than Border_Patrol agents , &quot; Veal said . &quot; It ' s going_to mean agents are used more effectively. &quot; New computers will streamline paperwork . Commanders hope that an automated fingerprinting system will permit identification of all arrestees for the first time , providing records on arrest levels and repeat offenders after years of murky estimates . At present , Border_Patrol agents could conceivably capture and release a wanted murderer among the crush of immigrants because they do not always have the time or means to identify hardened lawbreakers . The shift to the border could eventually curtail the operations of the San Clemente and Temecula freeway checkpoints , which employ about 170 agents . Those stations are coveted assignments because they provide opportunity for promotions and alternatives to the grueling work_at The Line , but Commissioner Meissner told The Times that their value may decline . &quot; we ' ll continue to have those checkpoints at the present_time , &quot; she said . &quot; But if we succeed in San Diego in the way we envision with this level of resources , there will be much more deterrence at the border because we ' ll be preventing entry , and we will then have to look again at whether those checkpoints really make sense. &quot; If the plan works , arrests will rise and then decline as discouraged migrants give_up or go elsewhere , officials said . &quot; Nobody ' s naive enough to think it ' s going_to cure the total problem of the border , &quot; said INS spokesman Duke Austin in Washington . &quot; But as they move to other areas , the flow becomes more manageable. &quot; The second year of the proposal would add another 390 agents to the patrol , pending congressional approval . In addition to border enforcement , the wide-ranging initiative would also expedite deportation of immigrants convicted of serious crimes , streamline the political asylum process , strengthen sanctions against employers of undocumented workers and promote citizenship for legal immigrants . In Tijuana , however , many Mexicans believe that the forces of poverty and hunger will continue to drive illegal immigrants over any number of obstacles . &quot; It makes_it difficult , but not impossible , &quot; said Clark , the human_rights activist . &quot; The ingenuity of the migrants and the talent of the smugglers surely will find a way. &quot; Most illegal crossers will keep trying to sneak across from Tijuana because of the forbidding terrain of deserts and mountains to the east , Clark said . There have been predictions of harrowing tactics -- boat forays along California beaches and massive charges on Interstate 5 . And it remains to be seen if increased competition will push smugglers to raise their prices , which have remained constant since the late 1980s , Clark said . The get-tough policy has critics of the Border_Patrol worried about the potential for violence . The agency has suffered from flawed screening , training and oversight that have caused scandals and controversies . Clearly aware of the patrol ' s spotty image , the Clinton_Administration underscores the importance of internal scrutiny and human_rights . Agents are receiving additional civil_rights and ethics training , Meissner said last week . To keep better track of potential problem agents , an internal watchdog unit in Washington is monitoring complaint patterns more closely . Personnel officials say they are speeding_up woefully slow background investigations , which have remained incomplete long after agents were hired and allowed recruits with criminal_records to take_the_field . &quot; We have had problems in the past , &quot; Austin said . &quot; We have made great strides . We can identify people who may be problems before they become entrenched. &quot; The commissioner has also created a nationwide civilian advisory panel that will begin functioning by the summer , Austin said . It will be made_up of two Justice_Department representatives and 13 volunteers to be appointed by Meissner . Unlike a civilian review board for the patrol proposed by Latino legislators , the advisory panel will have no investigative powers and will concentrate_on improving community relations . &quot; She thinks there ' s a need for that type of input on the handling of complaints and in our own disciplinary actions and monitoring those actions , &quot; Austin said . &quot; This will assist her in getting an external view. &quot;</TEXT>
