   <HEADLINE> CRUTTENDEN HIT WITH $ 4.5-MILLION ACTION ; SECURITIES : FORMER MANAGER SAYS O.C. BROKERAGE FIRED HIM FOR REFUSING TO BREAK TRADING RULES . FIRM ' S FOUNDER DENIES CHARGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The former head of retail sales for Orange County ' s largest brokerage filed a $ 4.5-million complaint Monday against Cruttenden &amp; Co . alleging that he was fired for refusing to violate securities rules , his lawyer said . The complaint , filed by Bradley C . Weddon with the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , alleges that company founder Walter W . Cruttenden III knowingly sold low-quality stocks in_order to generate large fees on private stock offerings , many for small Orange County companies , said Gary L . Gebler , Weddon ' s attorney . Walter Cruttenden , reached Monday at the brokerage ' s Irvine headquarters , denied all_of the allegations in the complaint and characterized Weddon , who left the firm in February , as a disgruntled former employee . &quot; The whole_thing is ridiculous . He was fired for cause , &quot; Cruttenden said . He said he did not want to &quot; get_into the causes &quot; of Weddon ' s departure but said the company has &quot; excellent documentation. &quot; &quot; When people do bad things around here , we fire them , just like we fired Brad , &quot; he said . He would not elaborate . The NASD complaint alleges that Weddon , who was hired in August , 1990 , was fired earlier this year because he &quot; refused to participate in and tolerate the flagrant violation of NASD and SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission ) regulations by Cruttenden management . Cruttenden ' s solution , a retaliatory termination of the potential ' whistle-blower , ' clearly constitutes wrongful termination , &quot; the arbitration action states . The complaint asks_for $ 500 # 000 to compensate for lost wages and $ 4 million in punitive damages . &quot; I brought my concerns about the activity up_to management , and they didn ' t seem to care , &quot; Weddon said in an interview Monday . &quot; There was never any indication of them being unhappy with my performance. &quot; The arbitration action states that , under Weddon ' s direction , the brokerage ' s retail business doubled from $ 3 million for 1992 to $ 6 million for the following year . The eight-page complaint also alleges that , when the firm handled the initial public stock offering in 1992 for Wilshire Technologies , a Carlsbad company , it &quot; elected to disregard and bury negative information relating to the security , &quot; including earnings statements , which resulted in &quot; substantial monetary losses to public customers who bought based on Cruttenden ' s knowing misrepresentation of the company. &quot; Further , the complaint alleges that founder Cruttenden , compliance officer Dennis Holtorf and others maintained an account to keep_up with losses or gains from unauthorized trades_in client accounts . The document also alleges that Weddon made &quot; continued complaints about such conduct at the manager ' s meeting prior to his termination. &quot; Walter Cruttenden denied that Monday and said of Weddon : &quot; If he did know about those things , why didn ' t he say anything in the last three years ? &quot; Once the complaint is received by the NASD , the agency will assign a hearing date to resolve the dispute .</TEXT>
