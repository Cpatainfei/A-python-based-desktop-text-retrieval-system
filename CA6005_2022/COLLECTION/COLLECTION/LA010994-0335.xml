   <HEADLINE> MEXICO_CITY BLAST SPARKS FEARS VIOLENCE WILL SPREAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As army troops continued to bar access to indigenous communities in the south where the government has attacked suspected rebel strongholds , a car_bomb exploded early Saturday in the capital amid fears that violence may spread . A second explosion was reported in the tourist resort of Acapulco as government_agencies stepped_up security measures following threats from the self-proclaimed Zapatista National Liberation Army to extend its war to the capital . No one claimed responsibility for Saturday ' s explosions , but suspicion immediately fell on the Indian rebels . The Mexico_City newspaper La Jornada said it received a fax from the rebels saying they are willing to talk with the government , the Associated Press reported . The fax said the offer wasn ' t a surrender and appealed_to Mexicans to join the rebels ' cause . In the southern , impoverished state of Chiapas , where the uprising began a week ago , about 100 demonstrators marched through winter drizzle Saturday through the picturesque town of San Cristobal de las Casas demanding an end to all violence . And in Mexico_City , where at least 6 # 000 demonstrators marched Friday , an estimated 3 # 000 protesters rallied outside the Interior Ministry to demand the firing of Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco , who until recently was the governor of Chiapas . The protesters blame Gonzalez for past brutal campaigns against Chiapas ' large Indian population . The Mexico_City blast , which injured five people and damaged about 20 businesses , occurred about 1 a.m. Saturday in the underground parking garage of a shopping_center . Around dawn , a grenade exploded outside government_offices in the tourist city of Acapulco . No injuries were reported . The Zapatista Army claims to have an urban front , which earlier in the week vowed to attack &quot; nerve_centers of the oligarchy. &quot; Authorities said they were beefing_up police patrols and other security at airports and other government installations . &quot; People are afraid that ( violence ) could extend_to other parts of the republic and that this could turn_out to be a more organized group , &quot; said author Homero Aridjis , president of the Group of 100 , an environmental organization . In a report late Friday , the Interior Ministry conceded that the guerrillas are not a largely foreign-inspired movement and that the leaders are mainly home-grown .</TEXT>
