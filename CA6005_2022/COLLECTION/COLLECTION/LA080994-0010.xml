   <TEXT> We were pleased that LaVera Porter Williams recognized Pat Harvey as an important local anchor ( letter , Aug . 4 ) However , we must point_out that Harvey can be seen weekdays on KCAL TV Channel 9 , not Channel 5 . Harvey has been an integral part of KCAL ' s award-winning &quot; Prime 9 News &quot; efforts since the program ' s inception in March , 1990 . The co-anchor of the station ' s 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. newscasts , Harvey was recently honored with Emmys for her &quot; Sex &amp; Aids in Russia &quot; series , both for program content and for her excellence as the host .
