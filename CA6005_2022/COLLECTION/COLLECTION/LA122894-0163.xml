   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN DEFENDS CONTINUATION OF CHECHNYA WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin ordered Russian forces Tuesday to continue disarming the rebel fighters of Chechnya , and he defended the war against the Muslim republic as necessary to end the violence and instability of an outlaw regime . &quot; The reign of banditry on Chechen soil poses a danger to our entire country , &quot; Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address , his first speech explaining why he sent thousands of troops into the tiny republic Dec . 11 to crush Chechnya ' s 3-year-old bid for independence . &quot; No territory has the right to secede from Russia , &quot; Yeltsin declared , saying that Chechnya is an &quot; indivisible &quot; part of Russia under the constitution adopted a year ago . At the same time , Yeltsin sought to reassure the Chechen people , who suffered under Russian rule_in czarist and Soviet times , by promising that &quot; Russia is not an enemy to the Muslims &quot; and will respect Chechnya ' s unique traditions . The president made_it plain that Russia will not rest until the Chechen rebels and foreign mercenaries alleged to be fighting alongside them are disarmed . &quot; Law and order on the territory of the Chechen Republic will be restored , &quot; Yeltsin promised . &quot; Grozny should be cleansed of criminal elements shortly. &quot; Intelligence sources said a major attack on Grozny , the besieged capital , is expected before Saturday . Deputy Prime_Minister Nikolai D . Yegorov said the cleanup operation in Chechnya is to be completed within 10 days . In a gesture to the many Russians who have reacted with revulsion to televised footage of the carnage inflicted on civilians by Russian air strikes , Yeltsin ordered the military to halt &quot; bombing raids that can cause casualties among the peaceful population of Grozny. &quot; In fact , the bombing of Grozny was halted several days ago , although Chechen authorities reported Russian air strikes on outlying villages Monday and Tuesday . But if Yeltsin held an olive_branch in one hand , the Kremlin ' s other hand was still clenched in a fist . An unnamed military official quickly gave warning that the presidential order not to bomb Grozny did not mean that Chechnya ' s skies are safe . &quot; As soon as weather_conditions permit , &quot; the Russian air_force plans to attack Chechen positions with laser-guided missiles , a tactic that &quot; practically rules_out casualties among civilians &quot; because the missiles are accurate to within three yards , a senior Defense Ministry official told the Interfax news_agency Tuesday . A unit of elite Omon riot police was dispatched to Chechnya on Tuesday to take_part in the &quot; second phase &quot; of the Russian military operation , that of restoring order in Grozny , the Itar-Tass news_agency reported . The feared Omon troops have been used to crush rebellions and riots , and they stormed the Russian Parliament building in Moscow in October , 1993 . But Yeltsin insisted that a political settlement is still possible . He authorized three senior officials to negotiate with the Chechens for a cease-fire and disarmament . That offer has been made before by Moscow and repeatedly rejected by Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev , who has demanded a Russian withdrawal before his forces lay_down their arms . Dudayev remained defiant Tuesday . &quot; We propose , while there is still time , an immediate withdrawal of troops from Chechen territory , &quot; Dudayev said in an interview in Grozny before Yeltsin ' s speech . &quot; Chechnya does not want to shed the blood of Russian soldiers. &quot; Baiting the Russian bear as he has consistently since coming_to power in 1991 , Dudayev was shown on Russian television Tuesday giving an interview to a Turkish reporter in which he called_on Ankara to supply Chechnya with warplanes capable of bombing Moscow . &quot; Give me some airplanes who may fly to Moscow and I ( will ) attack , &quot; the former Soviet air_force general said in English , arguing that Turkey should help a Muslim neighbor defend itself against Russian bombing . Russia has vied with Turkey for centuries over influence in the strategic Caucasus region , and the plea for Turkish intervention in what Russia considers an exclusively internal affair seemed calculated to enrage the Kremlin . In Grozny , residents emerged from hiding in their basements Tuesday and went_out in search of food and water . Kiosks and small markets reopened , but the city reportedly remained without electricity or running water . Fighting continued in at least five areas outside the city . Russian authorities said two more Russian soldiers had been killed , bringing the official toll to 44 dead and 147 wounded . But casualty figures on both sides of the conflict are considered to be of dubious accuracy . Chechen officials claimed to have captured 16 Russian prisoners after fierce fighting near the city of Argun . They said Dudayev ' s 23-year-old son , Avgur , was seriously wounded during a Chechen attack on Russian positions there . Russian authorities said armed Chechen &quot; gangs &quot; in many areas have taken_to wearing Russian military_uniforms . The Russian government press service alleged that busloads of refugees trying to flee Grozny have been turned_around and sent to Freedom Square in downtown Grozny , where they are being kept as human shields in case Grozny is stormed . But there was no independent confirmation of this , and Russian official information has proved highly unreliable in the past . On Tuesday , a press-freedom watchdog group protested &quot; outrageous violation of journalists ' rights of access to comprehensive and authentic information , &quot; the pressuring of journalists to make their reports more sympathetic to Moscow and other violations of the Russian constitution . The Kremlin ' s response was more of the same . A reorganization of the official press service was announced that put Deputy Prime_Minister Sergei M . Shakhrai in_charge . The Kremlin has ample reason to worry about negative media coverage . A poll released Tuesday found that 75 % of Russians disapproved of Yeltsin ' s actions as president , up from 70 % in September , Interfax reported . The poll surveyed 1 # 602 Russians across the nation and was conducted Dec . 16-20 , before the intensive bombing of Grozny began . Yeltsin promised to step_up humanitarian aid to Chechnya , rebuild its schools and hospitals , restore postal_service and telephones , and pay pensioners who have not received their benefits for months or years . All the money Moscow has allocated for such purposes has been diverted by the Dudayev regime to buy weapons , he said . First Deputy Prime_Minister Oleg N . Soskovets estimated that it will cost a_trillion rubles -- about $ 285 million -- to rebuild Chechnya ' s shattered economy . The first priority will be restoring severed railroad service , he said .</TEXT>
