   <HEADLINE> ANALYSIS ; A WINTER OF IOC CONTENT AFTER LILLEHAMMER GAMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a divorce of convenience . Simple as that . The whole_thing had grown so unwieldy -- Winter_Olympics in February , then the Summer Games only a_few months later in a totally different part of the world . And then 3 1 / 2 years of nothing but preparation for the dreaded double all_over again , in two other parts of the world . And the bigger the Olympics got , the more difficult it was for all involved to put_on Games twice in one year . &quot; Let ' s split them up , &quot; someone suggested , and the hush that followed was absolute , for those who run the Olympics are not used to hearing radical proposals . And this was definitely a radical proposal . Split the Games ? Disturb the Olympic cycle ? Goodness , what would people think ? Still , something had to be done . And upon sober consideration , radical began sounding reasonable . So , eventually it was decided to spin_off the Winter Games from the Summer , putting them on_their_own four-year cycle . That meant one final Winter-Summer combination in 1992 , then the Winter Games quickly again in ' 94 , then four years later in ' 98 , four years after that in 2002 and continuing on that schedule . Summer Games would continue in the old cycle after ' 92 , again in ' 96 , then 2000 , and so on . That would make things much simpler for the International Olympic Committee -- and the national Olympic committees of the world , whose job it is to provide the athletes for the Games . And there might even be a byproduct . Maybe , just maybe , the Winter Games , that scrawny little_brother always standing_in the shadow of the strapping Summer Games , would grow a bit , acquire an identity of its own , perhaps even develop a little muscle . Talk_about your growth spurts ! It ' s not a certainty , but it ' s at least even money that in years to come , when the discussion gets_around_to it , Lillehammer ' 94 will be regarded_as the Olympics in which the Winter Games came_of_age . Not as a moneymaker , for these government-subsidized Games will not come_close to covering expenses , but in terms of interest . Here in Norway , and probably throughout most of Europe , the interest was enormous , as expected . But suddenly this time around , the Winter Games were boffo in the United States , too . Nobody had anticipated that . CBS might have hoped , but in previous years , hardly anybody said , &quot; Gee , the Olympics are_on tonight . Let ' s catch some of that great biathlon action. &quot; In the past , Americans watched the women ' s figure_skating , the hockey , a little of the speedskating , maybe some of the Alpine skiing . This year ? Many complained about CBS not having shown much of the action , but they watched whatever CBS was showing anyway . The network dominated the ratings during the first week of the Games , more of the same is expected when the second-week ratings are in , and last Wednesday night ' s showdown between Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding was the third-highest rated sporting event in U.S. television history . All of which would have been a bit surprising , had it not been for the X factor , the Harding-Kerrigan morality_play . The attack on Kerrigan in Detroit on Jan . 6 , and the subsequent involvement of Harding , her former husband and others known to her in the real-life soap_opera that followed , obviously alerted viewers to the fact that , yes , we were having Olympics again , even though we ' d had them only a_couple_of years ago . Even speedskater Dan Jansen , who played the lead in his own little ongoing drama here , was moved to remark about the Games ' high rating . &quot; I guess the situation with Tonya and Nancy had something to do with that . It seemed a_few months before the Games that people didn ' t even know they were coming. &quot; If &quot; Tonyagate &quot; piqued the interest , though , the Games themselves sustained it . The friendly Norwegians partied hearty for two weeks on the Alpine slopes , the Nordic arenas , the speedskating venues . They showed_up in such great numbers for cross-country_skiing and biathlon that other curious folk simply had to see what all that shouting , singing and flag waving was about . And with audiences like that , the athletes responded like ham_actors in a crowded drawing room . They showed new viewers what they , and people in so many other parts of the world , like about these winter sports . The men ' s 40-kilometer relay cross-country race , for instance , was far more gripping -- for its 1-hour 40-minute duration -- than any Super Bowl , recent or otherwise , has ever been . These Games , in fact , so excited the Norwegians that they are talking here about bidding again for the Winter_Olympics of 2010 and getting their money ' s worth out of the Olympic venues . As for the $ 130-million deficit , that was part of the plan . Said Tor Aune , press chief for the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee : &quot; The deficit is what the ( Norwegian ) government is paying as an investment for new ( tourist ) activity in this area. &quot; After the exposure of these Games , Norway probably won ' t remain Europe ' s best-kept secret . It is , in fact , every U.S. traveler ' s dream -- a beautiful , clean country whose people are not only warm , helpful and friendly but speak English in the bargain . The International Olympic Committee is almost giddy . &quot; Wonderful , &quot; IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said . &quot; Best ever. &quot; More expansive was Andrew Napier , the IOC ' s media liaison , who said : &quot; Lillehammer will be a golden memory . What Lillehammer has done for the Olympic movement is excellent. &quot; What Lillehammer did for the Olympic movement was to move the Winter Games out front and center , right there in the sunshine , next to big_brother .</TEXT>
