   <HEADLINE> POWTER KEG ; SHE ' S NO LONGER SATISFIED WITH MERELY STOPPING THE INSANITY . THE , UH , PASSIONATE HEALTH MAVEN BLASTS INTO YOUR HOME NEXT WEEK ON HER OWN TV TALK_SHOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the applause from the studio audience finally dies_down , Susan Powter gets some congratulations from the man upstairs . It ' s not God , exactly , but Executive Producer Woody Fraser , whose voice comes_through Powter ' s tiny earphone . &quot; Thank you , Woody , thank_you very much , &quot; she says into her body mike , although it looks as if she ' s speaking_to no one . Beaming , she turns_to her staff and squeals , &quot; My daddy said I did a good job ! &quot; God , &quot; she adds at a normal octave , &quot; I ' ve just gone_back 25 years. &quot; Even a professional motivator appreciates a little boost once in awhile . If you don ' t know the 36-year-old woman about to launch &quot; The Susan Powter Show , &quot; then you haven ' t been channel surfing . Her &quot; Stop the Insanity &quot; is the tsunami of infomercials . Men who push products by torching car hoods or baking cream_puffs in hot-air ovens are ripples by comparison . She ' s that wild woman with the spiky platinum buzz cut who jumps around yelling , &quot; Fat makes you fat ! &quot; or &quot; You ' ve gotta eat , you ' ve gotta breathe and you ' ve gotta move ! &quot; Then , the next minute , she ' s the girlfriend who makes the raw confession that she once wanted to kill her ex-husband and stresses that she ' s passionate , not angry . Using straightforward information on food and exercise -- info , she admits , that isn ' t original -- she propels her followers , mostly women , into health , self-esteem and empowerment . Don ' t want those eight glasses of water a day ? Don ' t want to munch on carrot_sticks ? Don ' t want to take an aerobics class from a perky Barbie doll in a thong leotard ? Fine . Neither does she . Those who have heard her story and believed have snatched_up her $ 79.80 infomercial package -- including audio tapes , a video , a fat caliper and various guidebooks -- to the tune of more_than $ 50 million . The phenom has become the stuff of People magazine stories . Anyone vaguely familiar_with Powter probably knows this much : She ' s a former Texas homemaker whose white-picket-fence life exploded when her husband left her to raise two young children on_her_own . She ate herself into a 260-pound stupor before she &quot; figured it out. &quot; That is , she discovered that low-fat foods and a basic exercise program were her salvation . But her story doesn ' t end minus 133 pounds later . There was a stint as a topless dancer , the time she was kept by a married_man , the tummy tuck , the exercise studio , seminars , books , videos , the infomercial , a second marriage , the brother who blabbed to the tabloids that she never was that fat ( she maintains she was ) . And now the talk_show . &quot; My husband said to me the other night , we ' re lying_in bed and he ' s flicking through the channels , and he said , ' God , they ' d give anybody a damn talk_show these days ! ' And I said , ' Thank_you ! Thank_you , honey , I appreciate it. ' Actually he said ' any moron . ' &quot; So here she is , in her partially furnished office in the Santa Monica studios where the show is taped before a audience . Sitting behind a rustic dark-wood desk decorated with a neo-romantic lamp , Powter exhibits the same unfettered energy as she does on television . She goes from zero to 60 in 1.3 seconds and seldom brakes . &quot; I came_out of the womb with energy , &quot; she says . She gestures with hands that end in fake coral-colored nails , her words tumbling out_in great , long rushes . When Powter gets angry -- er , passionate -- the tendons in her neck stand_out . Pushing_out so_much verbiage at once often results in incomplete sentences , even words . &quot; What I always do when I start explaining what the show is , &quot; she says , &quot; is tell them what it isn ' t . There will be no tabloid issues at all . There is no exploiting people at all . And there ' s no yelling and screaming and fighting and if that doesn ' t fly_on TV , it ain ' t gonna fly. &quot; She ' s banking that American women are tired_of watching people with over-teased hair blather about their addictions to phone sex . Her show will be celeb-free and low on experts : &quot; Oh , please . We ' ve been hearing from experts for years and it hasn ' t done us a damn bit of good . Women are experts . I want to talk to a woman who ' s gone_through it. &quot; And topics ? Everything from women and heart_attacks to the rain_forest to paper versus plastic . &quot; A million issues . A ba zillion . Funny ? I ' m going_to a construction site -- this is the truth -- I am getting_up on the beam with the guys and I want to see what the hell they ' re whistling at . I ' ve got the hat , the lunch box -- I ' m telling you , I ' m doing_it . I ' m so afraid of heights you don ' t know . Faaaabulous shows . I don ' t know why anybody didn ' t think_of this before. &quot; Executive producer Fraser , a veteran of the &quot; Home Show &quot; and &quot; Good_Morning America , &quot; calls Powter &quot; lightning in a bottle &quot; and adds , &quot; I ' ve put a lot of people in that host seat , and she ' s the fastest study. &quot; As someone who has already been a target of a &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; sketch , featuring Kirstie Alley in a blonde fright wig , is the hyperbolic Powter in danger of becoming a parody of herself ? &quot; If we get that successful in eight or nine years down the line , great , &quot; Fraser says with a chuckle . &quot; But you know , she ' s going_to have to fight that fight , and as long as she remains really interested in helping people change their lives , then she will not become a caricature of her life. &quot; That life now involves shuttling between Dallas and Los Angeles with her family , sons Damien , 11 , and Kiel , 10 , from her first marriage , and husband Lincoln Apeland . They recently bought a home_in Pacific Palisades . When in Texas , they share a duplex with her ex-husband and his wife so their kids can see both parents . She turned a bad divorce into a livable situation -- look_for it as a show topic . And six years into husband No . 2 , marriage still baffles her . &quot; I don ' t understand marriage , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' m not sure that I ' m very good at it . . . . I ' m learning how to be married and it ' s very hard for me . I ' m not that good at it , and he knows it . I mean , I don ' t scream ' wifey-poo , ' whatever that means . He ' s got his own thing , he ' s a musician , he does his own thing , I do my own thing . I ' m not sure that I ' ve decided on it yet . I ' m not sure it ' s my thing. &quot; Work is definitely her thing . But juggling a family , workouts and a TV_show isn ' t enough for Powter . She has written another book , this one titled &quot; Food. &quot; It will have her trademark no-nonsense information about nutrition and diet , plus low-fat recipes . &quot; I ' ve been working_on this for eight months every day from 5:30 in the morning , &quot; she says . &quot; Every day . I love this book . I love it ! I can ' t tell you how excited I am . Fabulous . ' Food , ' by Susan Powter . that ' s the title . ' Food , ' by Susan Powter . I ' m very excited . &quot; I interviewed . . . I can ' t even tell you . I mean , books ? You don ' t know . Interviews ? You don ' t know . Researching and doing and going and talking to dairy_farmers and everything . The FDA . We ' ve got_it all here . We took all_the mishegosh , the muck , that everybody is confu -- I mean , HDL , LDL , cholesterol , saturated fat , oil , good , bad , boil , fry , what do we do with this ? I broke it down. &quot; That ability to relate the basics to her audience has given Powter staying power , says Dr. David Heber , chief of clinical nutrition at the UCLA School_of_Medicine . &quot; Her greatest asset is that people can connect with her , and I think that ' s an important part of the therapy of obesity -- there are both psychological and physical aspects , &quot; he says . &quot; She is honest and upfront in that she does not claim to be a scientific expert . She ' s taking bits and pieces from the scientific literature and paraphrasing it correctly. &quot; Indeed , because her program is grounded in common_sense , Powter has not drawn the criticism heaped on some weight-loss gurus . &quot; Swear to God , you ' ll understand everything when you read this book , I ' m telling you , you ' re going to love it , &quot; she says , slapping the stack of &quot; Food &quot; pages next to her laptop . &quot; And then you make your own decisions because it ' s your decision with your body . Have you ever seen cuter kids than this in your life ? I just wanted to ask you , &quot; she says , suddenly grabbing a picture of her sons . &quot; In your life have you ever seen cuter kids than this ? Now they ' re 10 and 11 , they were , like , 5 and 6 here . But have you ever ? I mean , c ' mon . They ' re very cute kids. &quot; This is the Susan Powter viewers will get beginning Monday ( 5 p.m. on KCAL ) in their living_rooms -- the Susan Powter who will talk_about anything , from her kids to her failed marriage to her obesity . Because the time when she was too fat and unhealthy to play in the park with her kids is still very real in her mind . So is the memory of being too broke to pay the electric_bill . She taps into the past and her emotions easily , as if they sat in a shallow well . When she brings_up her problems , women listen . They understand the pain of being left for another woman , of hurting so_much that they stuff themselves , and hurt more and stuff more . Powter might not be where she is without Rusty Robertson , the manager / publicist who took_on the struggling aerobics-studio owner back in Dallas . The two are practically joined at the hip , business-wise and emotionally . They even have the same rapid-fire patter . &quot; I ' m the planner of the future for us , and Susan makes the best of where we are , &quot; says Robertson , a former actress . She recalls their first meeting : &quot; ( Susan ) walked in , bald , in a black leather jacket , looking great . She sat right in front of my desk and said , ' I ' ve got this program and I ' m saving people ' s lives . . . . Susan had been literally living below the poverty level . . . . This is a woman who truly lived_on nothing . that ' s why I respect Susan more_than any other woman in the world , including my mother. &quot; With Robertson tending the big picture , Powter can work_on the here_and_now . &quot; There ' s a balance now that I think a lot about , &quot; Powter says . &quot; I have a friend staying with me for a week and . . . I spent the afternoon shopping with her , and that was hard for me and I told her that . I realized that I ' d become very selfish with my time , which made me think -- is that good , is that bad , is that right ? I don ' t know . &quot; Basically I don ' t ever want to stop working_on stuff . The day I stop working I ' m going_to be 10 feet under . . . . The day that it ' s all OK is the day I want to have a Mack truck hit me . I mean , it ' s not OK . It never will be all OK . I never want it to be all OK . I want all_of it , everything . &quot; The other day I went_for a walk and I just said , ' Wow . I love this and I want everything and I ' ll take the good and the bad , you know ? Who the hell knows who I was talking , to , I was probably talking to a ficus bush . But I mean it . I want . . . I want . . . . I ' m willing to take the responsibility . I will work_on the bad . I ' ll work toward the good , but I want it all , I just . . . c ' mon , ' cause I like it. &quot;</TEXT>
