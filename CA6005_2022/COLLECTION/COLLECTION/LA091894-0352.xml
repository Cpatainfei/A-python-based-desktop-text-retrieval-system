   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; MILITARY IS STILL UNEASY OVER ITS MISSION IN HAITI ; PENTAGON : A TRUCE BETWEEN CLINTON AND OFFICERS IN THE ARMED FORCES HAS DEVELOPED . BUT IT COULD UNRAVEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The officer leaned_on a railing overlooking a verdant Pentagon courtyard and reflected on his commander_in_chief ' s latest order to muster the troops for a possible invasion of Haiti . The problem with President Clinton ' s Haiti policy , the officer complained , was the mixed signals , the flip-flops , the on-again , off-again threats . The problem with Clinton ' s Haiti policy , added a fellow Army_officer , is that troops alone cannot rebuild a country in which political terror and grinding poverty have long prevailed . The problem with Clinton ' s Haiti policy , chimed_in one brush-cut Marine , is that it will strain shrinking U.S. forces with yet another commitment at a time when money is short and demands are everywhere . Notably gone from the officers ' banter , however , was any talk_of a young Clinton ' s draft-dodging or pot-smoking . Gone was the stinging resentment of the days when Clinton appeared intent_on opening the military to out-of-the-closet homosexuals . Gone were the jokes about the commander_in_chief ' s weak salute or his letters to the draft_board . Military_officers , seemingly marching toward an invasion of Haiti at Clinton ' s order , are grappling with disquieting doubts about the mission they may be asked to conduct in that impoverished island nation . But the deep disquiet they felt toward Clinton almost two years ago has given_way to a more businesslike relationship . Today , few continue to question the intentions , the integrity or the military prerogatives of a commander_in_chief who never served in the U.S. armed forces . &quot; I think we ' ve gotten_over that immature thing , &quot; one Army_officer said . &quot; This is not a personal military thing against the President . He ' s the commander_in_chief , and most of the military has just sort of internalized that . We ' ve got our bats and balls and we ' re ready to play . People have basically made their peace with Bill Clinton. &quot; But it may be an uneasy peace . While the raw feelings of Clinton ' s early days in office have eased , the professional misgivings of many military_officers about the Haiti operation have not . And if an invasion of Haiti draws U.S. troops into a protracted commitment or , worse , military disaster , officers warned that their newly cordial relations with Clinton could sour . That , in turn , could have dramatic political consequences for a commander_in_chief whose foreign and defense_policies have failed to win the enthusiastic support of either the military or the American people . On Saturday , ready for a battle that could be defused by a last-minute diplomatic maneuver , military_officers were willing to fill the void with talk_about the impending mission and the policies that led to it . Clinton , meanwhile , took pains to demonstrate a solid front with the Pentagon ' s senior military_officers , traveling_to the Pentagon for a final briefing on the military ' s invasion plan . Striding out of the Pentagon with Gen . John Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , and the four chiefs of the nation ' s service branches in tow , Clinton appeared both commanding and attentive to the military officials -- a delicate balance for a leader as he prepares to send troops into harm ' s way . Many experts , pointing to Clinton ' s lack of military_service and his controversial first_steps in overhauling military policy , predicted that any use of force would unleash a torrent of barely concealed complaints from military_officers . And so far , many retired officers , including Persian_Gulf_War commander Gen . H . Norman Schwarzkopf , have been openly critical of Clinton and his invasion plans . By contrast , however , the misgivings of the military ' s active-duty leaders have been largely muted . Fortunately for Clinton , one of the military ' s most authoritative figures -- retired Gen . Colin L . Powell , a former Joint Chiefs chairman -- so far has voiced little public complaint about an invasion that has drawn weak support from the American public and vigorous opposition from Capitol_Hill . At Clinton ' s request , Powell joined former President Jimmy_Carter and Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) on a mission Saturday to the Haitian_capital of Port-au-Prince to try to defuse the crisis . But one senior officer , noting that many officers at the Pentagon harbor profound concerns about an invasion of Haiti , warned that the military ' s stance could change . If the Haiti invasion turns sour , he said , military_officers will be blunt in their &quot; I-told-him-so ' s. &quot; &quot; The chickens coming_home to roost will not just be from the military but from the public at_large , &quot; the senior officer said . &quot; President Clinton will really be held accountable if this thing goes south. &quot; Officers will not need to hold press_conferences to air their grievances , either . Lawmakers , many of them bitterly opposed both to the invasion and to Clinton , will call admirals and generals into open hearings to dissect the operation . In those sessions , as well as in future hearings on budgets and military_missions , the officer said , &quot; direct questions will be met with very candid and direct responses. &quot; Principally , officers cited concerns that they could be drawn into a protracted engagement in which foes are indistinguishable from friends and where the definition of success -- or of completion -- is not sharp . &quot; These are issues about which reasonable men and women will disagree , and that ' s the way this debate is being conducted , &quot; said one recently retired colonel who maintains close ties to former colleagues . &quot; But because the military ' s means are so limited now , all those apprehensions have been magnified. &quot; Still other officers complained about the constant stream of demands for military solutions at a time when their ranks , and their budgets , have thinned . At this point , the relative quiescence of military_officers reflects one crucial fact : Once a President ' s order has been given , the military ' s role is to determine how best to accomplish an operation ' s declared objectives , not to question whether they ought to be pursued . &quot; Do I think it ' s worth any American lives to intervene in Haiti right now ? No . There ' s not a catastrophe down there -- you can ' t justify it , &quot; one Marine officer said . &quot; But we ' re leaning forward right now . People joined the military to do stuff like this. &quot; Moreover , the proposed Haiti invasion comes at a time when the military_services are jockeying furiously for roles and resources in an environment of shrinking budgets and force consolidations . Last week , Army and Air_Force leaders were called before a congressionally established commission to plead their case , and in the coming week , the Navy and Marine Corps will be called_in . If it goes_forward , the Haiti invasion will give each service ammunition in the scramble for resources . &quot; There is a sense among many that , hey , it may be a lousy war , but it ' s the only one we ' ve got_at a time when everyone ' s being called_upon to justify themselves , &quot; the Marine officer said .</TEXT>
