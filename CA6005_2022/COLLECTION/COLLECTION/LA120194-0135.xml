   <HEADLINE> IMPROVED GASOLINE BLEND ARRIVES IN COUNTY TODAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tanker trucks begin delivering a new blend of gasoline to service_stations across Ventura County today , trying an altered formula designed to cut 15 % of pollution emitted from cars . The reformulated gasoline , expected to raise gas prices 5 to 10 cents per gallon , will be required at all gas_stations in the county and other places around the nation that violate federal health standards for air_pollution . Although the federal Clean Air Act does not require the sale of the new blend until Jan . 1 , oil_companies will infuse storage_tanks with the cleaner-burning fuel this month so they can flush out the old gas by the New Year . that ' s when the price increase should hit the pump , said Tim Hamilton of the Automotive Trade Organizations of California , which represents service_station owners . &quot; My prediction is that we are going_to see prices ease_up a nickel to a dime in January , &quot; Hamilton said . But he warned that the price per gallon could jump as high as 25 cents if oil_refineries fail to produce enough of the new formula . The new formula will replace all grades of gasoline regardless of octane . The improved fuel was applauded Wednesday by environmentalists and county air quality officials as an important step toward reducing pollution from cars -- the largest contributor to the county ' s serious smog problem . &quot; The minute the reformulated gas hits the market , there will be an immediate improvement in the performance of cars , &quot; said Veronica Kun , a senior scientist with the Natural_Resources Defense Council . &quot; It is a very worthwhile and cost-effective solution over the next couple of decades , as long as we have internal_combustion engines that rely_on gasoline. &quot; The new formula mandated by the Clean Air Act was developed during a six-year , $ 40-million research program undertaken by a consortium of 14 oil_companies and America ' s Big Three auto_makers . Over the years , much of the effort to reduce automobile pollution has concentrated_on improving cars . But this time , auto and oil_companies tinkered with gasoline formulas to reduce the emission of compounds that react with other chemicals in sunlight to form ozone , the major component of smog . &quot; It is a simple concept , &quot; said J . Wayne Miller , a leading chemical engineer with Unocal Corp . who worked with the consortium on the new formula . But he said it was not so simple to derive the new formula or figure_out the least-costly way to manufacture it . Miller said it will cost the industry an average of 5 cents a gallon to make the new formula . Market conditions , he said , will determine if that is passed_on to consumers . Miller is scheduled to tour Ventura County today to talk_about reformulated gasoline that reduces 15 % of air toxics , such_as benzene , and 15 % of smog-forming hydrocarbons . &quot; The reformulated gasoline is part of a series of steps to making air healthier to breathe , &quot; Miller said . Beginning in March , 1996 , the California Air Resources Board will require oil_companies to sell an even cleaner-burning blend of gasoline throughout the state . But the federally mandated reformulated gasoline emerging this month will only be required for_sale in Ventura County , the greater Los Angeles area , San Diego , and other areas around the country with severe smog problems : Hartford , New York , Philadelphia , Chicago , Baltimore , Houston and Milwaukee . Dozens of other metropolitan areas have decided to join the program , so the reformulated gas will account_for nearly 35 % of all domestic gasoline consumption , according to Unocal . Ventura County ' s highest smog levels usually occur in the inland valleys , such_as Ojai Valley and Simi Valley , where breezes off the ocean trap air pollutants against surrounding mountains . William Mount , Ventura County ' s deputy air_pollution control officer , said he views reformulated gas as a cost-effective way to further reduce air_pollution and help the county meet federal clean-air standards . &quot; We ' ve squeezed about everything we can out of our industrial section , &quot; Mount said . The new fuel , he said , &quot; is not going_to make a major impact , but it is part of the overall solution. &quot;</TEXT>
