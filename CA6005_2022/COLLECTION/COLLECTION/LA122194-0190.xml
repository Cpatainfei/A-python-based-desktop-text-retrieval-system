   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; Q &amp; A ; DO-IT-YOURSELF PENTIUM CHIP REPLACEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that Intel Corp . has finally decided to offer &quot; no questions asked &quot; replacements for the flawed Pentium computer chip , what should Pentium PC owners -- or prospective owners -- do now ? The company will provide a replacement any time during the life of the machine , so that even if you don ' t act now you can get a replacement later . Still , replacing the chip is not without hassles and risks . Here are some answers_for computer owners ' questions : * Q : I have a Pentium PC . How do I know if it has the flaw ? * A : Virtually all Pentiums shipped to date have the flaw . Some software programs , including most spreadsheets , will reveal the flaw if you run the following formula : ( 4 # 195 , 835 x 256 ) ( 3 # 145 , 727 256 ) The correct answer is 87 # 413.1 , but a flawed Pentium will yield 87 # 407.9. * Q : OK , I have the flaw . Should I replace my chip ? * A : If you are doing heavy-duty arithmetic such_as scientific modeling or very sophisticated spreadsheets that involve division , then you should get a new chip . Even then , according to Intel , the chances of your getting a wrong answer are &quot; once in every nine billion number pairs , &quot; but IBM and others who have researched the problem say that Intel has grossly underestimated the likelihood of an error . If you ' re using your computer for word_processing , graphics , communications , entertainment or simple calculations using programs like Quicken or Microsoft Works , then the odds of your encountering a problem are quite small . You then have to weigh the inconvenience and risks associated with replacing the chip against the benefit of having a chip without this flaw . * Q : I ' ve been thinking_of buying a Pentium machine . Will it have the flawed chip ? What should I do ? * A : If you buy a machine in the next month or so , there is a good chance it will have the flawed chip . You could instead buy a 486 that ' s upgradeable to Pentium , but this will probably be more expensive in the long_run . You could also wait for machines with new chips . But Intel ' s offer stands even for newly purchased machines , so you can get a replacement chip_at any time . * Q : What do I have to do to get a replacement chip ? * A : Call Intel ' s toll free customer support line at ( 800 ) 628-8686 . A recording will instruct you to press 5 for Pentium processors or hold if you ' re not calling from a touch-tone phone . Allow plenty of time for the call as you may be_on hold for a while . A representative will answer the call and ask you the make and model number of your PC along with your name , address and phone_number . Between seven and 15 days later , Intel says , you ' ll get a follow-up call . That person will verify exactly which Pentium PC you have ( there are 60 , 66 , 75 , 90 and 100 MHz models , but most people have a 60 or 90 MHz chip ) . In many cases , the CPU speed is part of your computer ' s name ( such_as Dell XPS-90 ) . Some utility_programs , including the &quot; Sys Info &quot; program from Norton Utilities , will report what type of CPU you have . The person who calls will also ask_for a credit_card number , but you will be charged only if you fail to return the old Pentium within 30 days after they ship a new one . If you return the chip later , they ' ll issue you a credit for the charge , according to an Intel spokesperson . You could be charged_up to $ 1 # 000 if you don ' t return the old chip . The chip should arrive within 60 days of the follow-up call . In addition to the chip , there will be instructions on how to perform a replacement , a list of local dealers who can replace it for you at no charge and a postage-paid box for you to return the old CPU . * Q : How hard is it to replace the chip myself ? * A : First , you need to open_up the computer . that ' s usually a matter of removing several screws and slipping_off the case but , in some situations , it can be more complicated . Then you have to hope that the CPU is accessible . It usually is but , on some systems , the CPU can be under a disk_drive or other component . If so , you ' ll have to remove that component . The next issue is whether you have a Zero Insertion Force ( ZIF ) or a regular socket . Chances are you have a ZIF socket , which , as the name implies , makes_it a lot easier to remove and replace a chip . If you have a ZIF socket , there will be a lever to one side of the CPU , which is the largest single chip on the system boards . In many cases , a Pentium processor has silver-colored metal fins ( a heat_sink ) on it , so it might not look_like a regular chip . The Pentium may also be mounted under a small fan which you can lift_out with the chip . If you don ' t have a ZIF socket , then you ' ll have to use a chip extraction tool or a small screwdriver to pry the chip out of its socket . This can be a bit tricky and , if you ' re not careful , it ' s possible to bend a pin on the CPU . * Q : What if I don ' t want to replace the chip myself ? * A : The replacement chip will come_with a list of your closest dealers or repair centers . Chances are you ' ll have to bring_in the machine . The dealer may be able to replace the chip while you wait or you might have to leave it and pick it up later . * Q : Are there any risks associated with changing the chip ? * A : There are always risks involved when you change components . If you fail to discharge any static_electricity in your body , for example , you can damage the Pentium or any other component . If you insert the chip incorrectly , you can bend a pin . Even if you decide to bring the machine to a service center , there ' s a possibility that you ' ll drop it or damage it in transit . Modern PCs can handle a small amount of jostling , but the hard_disk and other components can fail if they ' re dropped or shaken during transit . It ' s best to transport the machine in the original packing_material or at least place it in a well-padded box . You can even use a seat_belt to strap it into one of the car ' s passenger seats . If the machine is damaged during the chip replacement process , Intel will evaluate whether or not to pay_for the repair of the damages &quot; on a case-by-case basis , &quot; according to a spokesperson . * Intel offers to replace chips . A1 * Rivals could find opportunities . D6</TEXT>
