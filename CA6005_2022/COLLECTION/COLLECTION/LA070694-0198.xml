   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE EASE REGULATIONS ON FOREIGNERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new government Tuesday ordered a slashing of some of the red_tape that has blocked foreign businesses from the Japanese market , and the finance_minister called_for even more cuts . The package to ease regulations on 279 products and services was approved in principle in the last_days of the previous government , but outgoing Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata left final approval to the new government , which was formed last Wednesday . A major part of the package is wider acceptance of foreign test data on home building_materials , automobiles , food_products , pharmaceuticals and other goods . New Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama is to explain the plan ' s details to President Clinton this weekend while both are at the Group of Seven summit in Naples , Italy , officials said . Japan has announced deregulation on 781 other items in the past year as part of measures aimed both at stimulating Japan ' s sluggish economy and reducing its giant trade surplus , which reached $ 59 billion with the United States alone last year . The huge surplus is one of the factors contributing to the yen ' s rise against the dollar . The strong yen stifles Japan ' s export-driven economy by making its products more expensive to foreign consumers . The dollar last week fell to below 100 yen for the first time since World_War_II . It closed at 98.70 yen in Tokyo in late-morning trading today . &quot; This package is a step_in the right direction , but more steps are necessary &quot; to give foreign competitors a better chance at success in Japan ' s market , said Jason James , an economist at securities firm James Capel Pacific . But the new finance_minister , Masayoshi Takemura , was among the critics who called the package insufficient . He urged other Cabinet members to promote deregulation more aggressively . Masaru Takagi , chief economist with Fuji Research Institute , said the new Murayama government should make Tuesday ' s package the starting_point for further deregulation . &quot; The question is still how to increase domestic demand and thus reduce the trade surplus through deregulatory measures , &quot; Takagi said . Murayama told a news_conference Friday that he would continue to promote economic reform and domestic consumer demand to try to increase economic expansion and ease trade friction . The package calls_for formulating a five-year deregulation action program by the end of the fiscal_year , next March 31 . It is unclear how much power Murayama ' s government will have to push new deregulation . The government is an uneasy coalition of Socialists and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party , and Murayama has said he will call national elections soon .</TEXT>
