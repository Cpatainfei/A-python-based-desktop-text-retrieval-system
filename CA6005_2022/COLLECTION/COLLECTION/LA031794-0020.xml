   <HEADLINE> GARDEN FRESH ; THE DANDELION : A WEED IN ITS PLACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even the most city-bred among us at some time in childhood bent down and plucked a puff of dandelion , blew on it and watched , transfixed , as a_zillion seeds on silken wings sailed away on the wind . Then some of us grew_up to be gardeners and installed lawns . Rather than being transfixed by the blowballs , the adult in us now gets agitated . Out the plants come_by their roots , usually with a curse . Never was the definition of a weed more apt than for the dandelion : a plant out_of_place . Certainly dandelions don ' t belong in a manicured lawn . But with their raggedy leaves in ebullient rosettes , dandelions are a joy in the border . Set their sprays of green beside bright primroses and dahlias . Lend their sauciness to sedate sages and kales . Back to childhood . If any of us knew the leaves beneath the puffs were good for us , there ' d have been fewer seeds on the wind . No self-respecting child has anything to do with something healthy . * So next time you pull_up a dandelion when it ' s out_of_place ( assuming it has never been sprayed ) , bring it into the kitchen . The thinnish , slightly succulent leaves are lightly bitter -- refreshing in the manner of curly_endive . With its forgiving nature , dandelion will nourish you mightily . The raw leaves have twice the beta carotene of beet_greens , as much iron as spinach and as much calcium as turnip greens . In its season , every part of the dandelion can be enjoyed . As is the case with most plants , the leaves are tenderest and most delicately flavored before the plants flower . Of course , raw dandelion leaves are an enchanting addition to tossed salads . Pick them as small as you can so you ' ll have the pleasure of seeing a whole indented leaf -- don ' t waste the effect by tearing it into pieces . If you nip_off buds as they come_along , you ' ll keep the leaves virginal . The trick is to have enough plants dappled through the garden so you can let some flowers bloom . Summer ' s small golden daisy-like flowers are also charming in salads . Were you to have bucketfuls , you could make a delicate and flowery golden wine ( ask your local library for a book on homemade wines ) . And if you let a_few flowers turn_into fairy puffs , your supply of fresh plants for next season will be assured . Then in autumn , the large roots may be cooked as parsnips . Or slowly roast the roots until dry and dark brown , finely grind them , then brew them into a lusty sort of coffee . Now dandelion leaves are classed as a potherb -- one of the greens that rise so easily in spring they ' re disprized . Potherbs are traditionally dropped into a simmering pot along with savory vegetables such_as carrots and onions to make an invigorating soup . * You ' ll also read about potherbs being cooked like spinach . For my part , I don ' t fancy a mess of boiled dandelion_greens . Whether raw or barely cooked , I like to use them as an accent . I ' m partial to slicing slender greens into ribbons . When a recipe calls_for leaves of chicory , arugula , escarole , curly_endive or Italian_parsley , for example , I play with dandelion leaves in their place . Bear_in_mind that , as with other greens that are wild at heart , lemon buffs the rough edges and makes dandelion ' s flavor shine . Italians have a gift for lifting what others consider lowly to the inspired . Especially in compositions of pasta . Mix al dente rigatoni with chopped , softened sun-dried tomatoes , ribbons of dandelion leaves , thinly sliced celery , minced garlic ( all these vegetables raw ) , olive_oil and lemon_juice . Toss piping-hot cheese tortellini with ribbons of dandelion leaves and fine shreds of lemon_zest , dress with olive_oil and wisps of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese ( ready-to-cook tortellini are available in many deli cases ) . Chop dandelion leaves and mix with toasted pine_nuts -- melted butter this time with the lemon_juice -- into translucent egg_noodles . Another Italian way is to thread ribbons of raw dandelion leaves through rich broth , then top with grated cheese . * The confusing thing is that when you see greens labeled Italian dandelions in the market or a catalogue , they ' re not dandelion but chicory . There are several dandelion-like chicories , and their leaves can grow a foot long . True dandelion leaves are rarely longer than the span of a hand . Now in these sensuous days when even water comes_in designer flavors , there are designer dandelions . Naturally , they ' re French . They are refined forms of our childhood dandelion , the leaves a bit larger and the flavor a bit milder . With names such_as Amelior and Verte de Montmagny , they are beautiful . Dandelions are hardy perennials , that is , they ' ll be evergreen in a balmy garden and return after frost in a frosty garden for years . Although some say the plants lose quality after the first year and recommend pulling them up , I don ' t . I find that it depends_on the plant ' s quality_of_life . Although they ' ll grow generously almost anywhere , what makes dandelions happy is well-drained soil in full sun , and they ' ll beam if their soil is fertile . The refined sorts of dandelions do_best when started indoors . For autumn eating , sow from the month before through the month of your last expected frost of spring -- or if you have no frost , any time in spring . Where it ' s very hot in summer and also where it ' s temperate , you can sow seeds in late summer for fresh dandelions over winter . Keep at about 60 degrees and don ' t let them dry_out . When the plants have five or six leaves , set them in the garden , first hardening them off ( for a week before transplanting , put them outside every day , then bring them in at night ) . * To plant , snip back the roots and tips of leaves by about one-quarter . This light pruning makes the plant throw its energy into vigorous roots and new leaves . Keep moist the plants you don ' t want to flower ( dry soil causes them to start making seeds ) . Regularly pick leaves for salad from the center , those for cooking from the outside , to keep leaves coming . Should dandelion leaves prove too bitter in late summer , blanch them . Although blanching cuts_down on nutrients -- the deeper the green , the richer the Vitamin_A -- pale dandelion leaves are as elegant as Belgian_endive . And unlike Belgian_endive , you can ' t buy them . Wait until the plant is mature and the days are relatively cool ( usually autumn or spring ) . Expect the plant to deteriorate once blanched , so either eat fast or do a_few plants at a time . Make_sure the leaves are bone-dry , or they ' ll mildew ( if the plant is in the path of necessary watering , cover it with a bucket for a_few days ) . Remove all dead or dying leaves . Gather_up the leaves fairly tightly and tie with something soft about one-third down from the top . The outside leaves won ' t blanch , of course , but in 10 to 14 days , inside leaves will be creamy-white tinged with butter-yellow and will taste worlds sweeter . * Still not mainstream , when you ' re looking_for dandelions in seed_catalogs , if they ' re not listed , look under Greens or Salad_Greens or , as a last_resort , under Herbs . And when you pass dandelions in the grass , remember your childhood and return their smiles . Sources Fresh -- Supermarkets and farmers ' markets . Seeds -- Amelior from the Cook ' s Garden , P.O.

According to your mood and menu , this may also be prepared with walnut_oil and embellished with toasted walnuts or pine_nuts . . . or with chopped , hard-cooked eggs . . . crumbled bacon . . . diced pimientos . . . matchsticks of softened sun- dried tomatoes . . . or cooked celery_root . . . or make_it a main dish with small shrimp or diced ham . . . When dandelions are scarce , I substitute part or all curly_endive or another chicory -- any slightly bitter leaf that still has a vestige of crunch when wilted .
