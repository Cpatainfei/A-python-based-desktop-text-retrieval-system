   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON BOSNIA ; HAVE WE FORGOTTEN THE LESSON OF GUERNICA ? ; ONCE BEFORE , THE WEST WATCHED A TOWN LIKE BIHAC BEING DESTROYED , WITHOUT CHALLENGING FASCISM ' S SPREAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since the so-called international community decided to capitulate and abandon the U.N.-proclaimed &quot; safe zone &quot; of Bihac to the Serbs ' brutal onslaught , there is more interest in the press for the unity of the United Nations and NATO , which proved to be so impotent in Bosnia ' s case , than for the fate of 180 # 000 civilians in that remote Bosnian town . But in those rare news_stories about the continuing terror , one element didn ' t change . Almost seven days after the U.N. commander announced with certain relief that the &quot; Serbs can take Bihac at their will , &quot; the Serbs occupied only 30 % of the area and were still &quot; a_few hundred yards &quot; away from the town ' s hospital , shelling patients . This means that the defenders of Bihac , armed just with light personal weapons against a huge military_force -- tanks , cannons , rocket_launchers , mortars and anti-aircraft guns -- managed to keep their lines much longer than did the international institutions that were supposed to protect them . There is strong symbolism in that . The defense of Bihac is not just a fight for the survival of 180 # 000 desperate people &quot; paralyzed by fear &quot; and with no place to go . It is also the last line_of_defense of the most basic rules and principles on which the international new order was supposed to rest . It is also the testing ground of the forces of ultranationalism , racist &quot; ethnic purity &quot; and genocidal &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; to check if there is anything to oppose their quests_for greater states , starting with &quot; greater Serbia. &quot; But they dream , like Russia ' s Vladimir Zhirinovsky , about the &quot; orthodox empire from Vladivostok in Russia to Knin in Croatia. &quot; And then it won ' t be &quot; just &quot; Bosnia or Bihac but many other borders , states and towns that will be disputed , contested and targeted because they don ' t fit_in the maps developed by Milosevic-Karadzic-Mladic-like conquerors . This is why in listening to the reports about Bihac I see Picasso ' s &quot; Guernica. &quot; That painting depicted the town bombed and terrorized during the Spanish Civil War without anyone recognizing that it was fascism marching_on its way to the most terrible crime in history . Marching unchallenged like the Serbian genocidal forces in Bosnia . It is not only shameful but also frightening for the future of the Balkans and the whole of Europe to see the institutions of the new_world order powerless , humiliated and defeated in Bosnia and even conspiring to make the best out of that failure and , instead , producing face-losing formulas . There are more and more signs that the abandonment of the Bihac &quot; safe zone &quot; was a deliberate , calculated and coordinated decision to speed the &quot; final solution &quot; for Bosnia , to force it to surrender , and then to present its capitulation as the peace settlement and permanent cease-fire . But they miscalculated at one crucial point . Even under the blackmail of abandonment , Bosnians can ' t surrender because they have no place to go and they don ' t have the_British and French colonial arrogance of proclaiming someone ' s country someone else ' s . They will fight for the survival of Bihac , for the survival of the country and for high principles , which were so easily sacrificed in this case . With the experience of Bosnia , which was prevented by the arms embargo from protecting itself and was openly told that no one will protect even the &quot; safe zones , &quot; it is cynical to discuss expansion of NATO or European security . What kind of all-European &quot; partnership for peace &quot; can these institutions guarantee to the newly born European democracies , when they proved to be so tragically impotent in protecting even a small Bosnian town ? that ' s why Bihac might not be just an &quot; episode that shouldn ' t affect the future of the alliance , &quot; as Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher put it in Brussels . Bihac is the symbolic beginning of the whole post-Cold War history , and now that all institutions of the collective_security have failed so miserably , those who had any power to stop genocide in Bosnia must take_care as_to which side of that history they want to be recorded as being_on : the side of marching ultranationalism and genocidal &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; or the side of international_law and order defended now only by the heroic defenders of Bihac ?</TEXT>
