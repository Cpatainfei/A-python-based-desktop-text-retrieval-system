   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CHINA TRIP UNDERSCORES U.S. POLICY CONTRADICTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s just-completed human_rights mission to Beijing was aimed at making China a less sensitive issue on the Clinton_Administration ' s foreign_policy agenda . Instead , Christopher ' s lack of results and the avalanche of vitriol that the trip inspired from both sides have done the reverse : They have catapulted China to the top of the list of America ' s problems overseas , creating dilemmas for which there will be no easy solutions . And they have underlined seeming contradictions in the Administration policy toward China . &quot; This ( trip ) now raises the amount of political capital that an already weakened President will have to spend to keep this China issue from spilling over , &quot; Douglas Paal , an Asia specialist and former George_Bush Administration official , said Tuesday . Clinton &quot; is eventually going_to have to go_to Congress to hold the China policy together. &quot; With China , the Administration ' s foreign_policy team does not face the sort of problems that have plagued it elsewhere -- in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Somalia and Haiti . The question in those disputes has been to what extent , and for what sorts of missions , America should commit its troops abroad in an era of limited resources at_home . Yet for American foreign_policy and the Administration ' s own future , China is likely to be more important than any of those trouble spots . The issues confronting the Administration in China are broader than the use of force . China is , after all , Asia ' s emerging superpower and one of the most important countries in the world . How , then , and to what extent , should America confront China over human_rights abuses that violate what Christopher calls America ' s &quot; core values &quot; ? What tactics best achieve this goal ? Should the Administration encourage or cool the ardor of an American business_community that , rightly or wrongly , views the China market as its version of nirvana ? Should the United States accommodate a regime that , less than five years ago , used live ammunition against citizens on the streets of its capital ? Beijing has voiced no regrets for doing so and has changed few of its top personnel since then . It still imprisons some democracy advocates and during Christopher ' s trip continued to detain more of them . Eleven days and more_than 20 # 000 miles ago , when Christopher was leaving Washington for Asia , reporters asked him why he was traveling_to Beijing . Only hours before , Chinese officials had initiated a series of roundups , detentions and interrogations of dissidents that would continue up_to and during the secretary ' s visit to China last weekend . Yet Christopher ' s schedule had been fixed , and he showed no interest in changing it to adapt to changing circumstances . &quot; These events only underscore the importance of being able to make human_rights points at the highest level , &quot; he explained . Now , in the wake of Christopher ' s trip , the question has to be asked : What went_wrong ? And why did he go_in the first place ? Christopher and his aides argued that , while in Beijing , the secretary delivered a tough message to the Chinese regime , one that Premier Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin needed to hear . China , he said , must do more to retain its low-tariff trade benefits in the United States . Yet whatever Christopher said , the Chinese leaders probably got a different message . They saw that Christopher had come talking_about the need for a broader relationship between Washington and Beijing -- even as the Chinese regime was showing its people and the rest of Asia that it has the power to do whatever it wants to suppress peaceful opposition . If the Clinton_Administration wanted only to deliver a tough message to Beijing about its human_rights policies , which the Chinese leadership would have understood without ambiguity , in retrospect canceling the trip might been a more effective way of making the point . But there were other purposes for Christopher ' s visit that could not have been achieved that way . The truth is the Administration also wanted , through this trip , to improve its ties to Beijing . The American business_community -- fearing losing out_to such foreign competitors as the_French and Japanese , whose prime_ministers will soon visit Beijing -- wants to smooth_over the human_rights disputes to ensure there will be continued trade with China . And the Pentagon wants to work more closely with China on important issues , including North_Korea and non-proliferation . These factors help explain why Christopher chose not to cancel his visit . But they also underscore the mixed message the Administration is sending to Beijing . The Chinese have a favorite concept that can be applied to the American policy : It is a maodun , or contradiction . In Chinese terms , it is a maodun for the Administration to want to confront China head-on over human_rights abuses while improving ties with it to benefit the business_community and the Pentagon . To Chinese Marxists , in particular , a maodun is something to be exploited . And Beijing is certainly showing it knows how to exploit underlying contradictions of American policy . The American business_community , for example , has been so well courted that it is leading the charge in criticizing Clinton ' s policy toward China . How did the Administration get_into this mess ? To understand America ' s China policy , one must look_to the common_factor in the personalities of the three men who serve as its principal architects -- President Clinton , Christopher and Winston Lord , assistant secretary_of_state for East Asia . All three have records of strongly supporting human_rights . Yet all are instinctive balancers , better at trying to accommodate all points_of_view than at making hard choices . Clinton , the politician , has made a career out of appealing_to different factions within the Democratic Party without alienating any of them . It has worked often in the White_House , most recently in his successful campaign on behalf of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Christopher , the lawyer , had his most memorable success when , as deputy secretary_of_state , he patiently negotiated the deal with Iran that allowed the release of American hostages . Lord , a foreign_policy specialist who began his career as a Republican appointee but now works for the Democrats , is a cautious man who likes to borrow from both sides of any argument . That worked well on Vietnam policy , when he led the way in taking seriously the issue of missing U.S. servicemen while slowly building political support for a lifting of the trade_embargo . But can the Administration mediate , balance or accommodate all_the competing interests on China ? For a short time , the problem might be fudged . If China follows past patterns , it may soon release a_few dissidents from jail or let families of dissidents leave the country . In the wake of Christopher ' s trip , Clinton is now in a situation where he may be forced to inflate the significance of cosmetic gestures if he is to extend China ' s trading benefits after they expire in July . Ultimately , the President may find that he must impose discipline on his Administration ' s China policy , making hard choices among the separate , conflicting agendas of human_rights , commerce and military strategy . * RELATED STORY : D1</TEXT>
