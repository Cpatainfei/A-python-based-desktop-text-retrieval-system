   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; A FRENCH CONNECTION ; EDUCATION : LANGUAGE IMMERSION WAS THE GOAL , BUT SEVEN TEEN-AGERS ALSO GOT A TASTE OF INDEPENDENCE AND INTERNATIONAL LIVING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Learning to speak French was the goal , but spending a summer in France provided more_than a language education for seven Orange County teen-agers who attended Lycee Paul Valery , a three-week summer school in Menton , France . While tasting independence and negotiating the_French language , we became locals in an international school atmosphere . Menton , a border town on the_French Riviera , is only 10 minutes by train to Italy . The school ' s location makes_it ideal for international exchanges . Language immersion classes filled the mornings , leaving the afternoons free to explore the Matisse and Chagall museums in Nice , the Jacques Cousteau Aquarium in Monaco and the tiny medieval-looking town of St . Paul de Vence . We had time to sample hazelnut ice_cream , to skip down Monaco ' s petunia-lined streets and relax on a pebble beach watching fireworks explode and float down into the Mediterranean_Sea . Since curfew at the school was 2:30 a.m. on weekdays and 4:30 a.m. on weekends , the local discotheque beckoned . There was dancing -- the music alternated between techno and American tunes -- romance and a smoke-filled environment . &quot; For us , the curfew seemed like it was really late , but it ' s not for French_people . Things start at midnight , &quot; said Costa Mesa High_School senior Susan Channels . The opportunity for the Orange County students to attend the school and taste the culture came_about after Sunny Hills High_School French_teacher Lynn Johnson met the_French school ' s director , Gerard Poulet , while team-writing the new International Baccalaureate French exam . &quot; He knew that I was looking_for a French summer school to send students to and it was just kind of out_of_the_blue that he offered his school , &quot; Johnson said . After a two-week tour of England and France with 23 other high_school students who were part of the International Study Tours program , seven of us chose to further our studies at Lycee Paul Valery . * We took the bullet train to the south of France and the school , where we were the only Americans enrolled . &quot; I was really intimidated by the people at first , &quot; said Sunny Hills High_School junior Katie Tucker . &quot; I thought everyone knew more French than I did . I found that that wasn ' t the case . There were all levels and everyone was pretty friendly. &quot; Founded in 1967 , the school offers two summer sessions , each lasting three weeks . It is for students 16 and older . Most of those in_attendance with us were in their 20s . Second-session enrollment totaled 70 students and represented 10 nationalities . &quot; The originality of the school is that we combine a serious , intensive course in the morning with a definite holiday outlook in the evening , &quot; said Poulet , who teaches French during the year at the University of Exeter in England . &quot; Because we ' re small , we know everybody and there is a relaxed spirit. &quot; On campus , four students of different nationalities shared a two-room suite . Meals were served in a central cafeteria . Classes ran from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Monday through Friday . The school_day began when Poulet clapped his hands three times each morning and hollered , &quot; La joie par le travail , &quot; meaning &quot; Work brings joy. &quot; Students were placed in one of four class levels : beginner , elementary , intermediate or advanced , according to written and oral tests . &quot; Most clientele are people who had French in school , but didn ' t learn how to communicate , &quot; said Etienne Andre , a professor and native of Menton . &quot; Our goal is to develop the speaking ability by teaching grammar , vocabulary and idioms. &quot; &quot; Class wasn ' t what I expected , &quot; said Jessica Johnson , a junior from Sunny Hills High_School . &quot; We worked_on verbs and played murder mystery games -- all_in French . Everyone actively participated and learned lots of new vocabulary relating to how the victim died ; not that we ' ll use those words , but it helped to play the game. &quot; * Time outside of class was &quot; adventure time. &quot; One Friday afternoon , the group took the train to Vintimille , a border town in Italy . The open market buzzed with activity , resembling a swap meet . For some of us , the true quest was food . The gelato tasted yummy , but pizza took a while to find . Restaurants close_in the afternoon . We finally asked a waitress in French for pizza to go , but she had to round_up an English translator to understand us . After 35 minutes , it still had not arrived because the waitress had forgotten to pick_up our order . We finally got our pizza , but missed the early train back to Menton . We sat outside the station and ate our mushroom and cheese_pizza while waiting for the next train . We took beach excursions , hiked to the Fragonard perfumery and went shopping in the old village . There were spirited volleyball and Ping-Pong tournaments , water-skiing on the Mediterranean and attempts at making giant crepes with a Belgian friend on the school ' s industrial-size kitchen_stove . &quot; The staff gave us a lot of freedom and I think we handled it really well , &quot; said Melissa Birkholz , also from Sunny Hills . &quot; My parents trust me more now. &quot; The weeks passed quickly . At the end of the session , the mayor of Menton hosted a formal diploma ceremony at the town_hall to commend the students ' efforts . The students who absorbed the most French during the session tended to have the highest comfort levels , both with the language and with being away from home_in a foreign country . Reflecting on the experience , Sunny Hills student Ann Kim said she felt older students might fare better . &quot; I ' d recommend Menton to someone who ' s older , at least 18 . You need someone who ' s willing to speak French and try new frontiers , the person who is the brave traveler , &quot; she said . Johnson , the Sunny Hills teacher who set things in motion , said she is anxious to see how what the students learned translates into the classroom this year . &quot; This experience melds everything they ' ve learned . Learning a language is always a struggle in class , but when you ' re set_in a real-life situation , it all comes_together in a way that ' s phenomenal. &quot; As for personal growth , Los Alamitos High_School junior Michelle French said : &quot; I learned a lot about myself and how I judge people . I learned how to take_care of others and myself . I ' d love to go back. &quot;</TEXT>
