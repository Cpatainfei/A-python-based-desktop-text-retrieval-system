   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON POLITICS ; THE DEMOCRATS ' TROUBLED SALES JOB ; THEY can ' t WIN THE WHITE_HOUSE AS GOP-MODERATE CLONES ; MAYBE A PURE LIBERAL STANCE ISWORTH TRYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine taking_on the job of Middle_East sales rep for Virginia_ham , or exporting tea to Brazil . How about managing a skateboard store in a retirement community ? This gives you an inkling of the thoughts that have been haunting Democratic strategists : Maybe we ' re in the wrong business . Scanning the presidential elections since World_War_II for evidence of convincing Democratic victories -- popular-vote totals that we denominate as mandates -- we find that only once did the winner go much above 50 % . That was in 1964 , when Lyndon Johnson , the successor of the martyred John Kennedy , trounced the ultraconservative Barry Goldwater by 23 points . During the same postwar period , however , Republicans won smashingly in five of their seven victories . Only Richard Nixon finished with less than 50 % , and that was in the three-way race with Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace in 1968 . Bill_Clinton ' s 43 % in 1992 was the lowest of all . In their effort to reclaim their market share of the electorate , some Democratic groups -- most notably the Democratic Leadership Council -- have argued , quite plausibly , that only a move to the political center will save Clinton ' s presidency and , indeed , the party itself . They argue that a forthrightly liberal Democratic Party would be nothing more_than a stunted , isolated leftist sect -- a stark denial of the fact that the country seems headed resolutely in a rightward direction . The strongest support for a centrocentric Democratic Party comes from its last two presidential victories , in 1976 and 1992 . The moderate appeal of Jimmy_Carter and Bill_Clinton , it is argued , enabled them to win . But another way to look_at those two victories is that Carter and Clinton would have won no matter where they were situated ideologically ( barring , of course , flagrant extremism ) . Anger with Watergate and the pardon of Nixon would have propelled any of the 1976 Democratic primary hopefuls into the White_House . Likewise , the readiness of the public to trade_in recession-weary George_Bush in 1992 could have benefited anyone from Paul Tsongas to Tom Harkin had they been more successful than Clinton in the primaries . Difficult as it may be for Democrats to accept , they tend to win the White_House when Republicans get_into trouble . The Democratic Party is America ' s standby equipment . It is the relief_pitcher , the national escape clause , the voice when we dial 911 . While the Democrats until this year had been able to dominate congressional elections , the presidency with its high moral symbolism and patriarchal majesty has been Republican real_estate in normal times . And what did the last two Democratic beneficiaries of voter rejection of Republicans do ? They picked_up the precepts of the men they had just defeated . Carter plunged ahead with the deregulation agenda set by Gerald Ford and Clinton went_all_out for NAFTA and GATT , which may have been good public policy but Republican policy all_the same . For his troubles , Carter got what Democratic presidents can expect when they govern like Republicans : a challenge from the party ' s left . Clinton courts the same fate if his definition of New Democrat varies in no substantial measure from garden-variety Republican . ( As for a challenge from the Democratic right , that is ludicrous . Who would mount it , Sen . Howell Heflin ? ) The one thing that has any political significance for the Democratic Party is its liberal wing -- the unions , the poor , the minorities , the old_men who got their first paycheck from the New Deal , the middle-aged women in Birkenstocks , the bald guys with pony tails fixing_up old VW buses in Berkeley and , at least potentially , a whole_lot of new voters turned_off by the GOP ' s puritanical tendencies . For the Democrats , finding , much less capturing , the elusive political center is a task more metaphysical than political , more the stuff of necromancers than pollsters . When Republican presidents blow it and Democrats have a chance to govern , the last thing in the world they should contemplate is taking the stance that the voters have just repudiated . They should use these opportunities to demonstrate the virtues of liberalism , not repent of them . Political survival alone dictates that the standby equipment be made of different stuff than the gear that has broken_down . Democratic presidents who are forthrightly liberal , however , are far more able to conciliate those elements in the party who can be counted_on to cause the most sleepless nights : a sullen and rebellious left .</TEXT>
