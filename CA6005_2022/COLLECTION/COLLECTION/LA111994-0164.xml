   <TEXT> The weekend should be a great one for outdoor_sports and events , according to weather_forecasters who predict warmer temperatures and clear skies for Orange County through Sunday . Strong winds should continue to buffet the Southland , with gusts of up_to 35 m.p.h. expected . Wind advisories are in_effect for mountain areas and the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys . According to WeatherData Inc. , which provides forecasts for The Times , temperatures today should reach the lower 70s and not dip below the upper 40s . Sunday should be a bit warmer with most of the gusty wind conditions , what forecasters describe as a &quot; cool Santa Ana , &quot; gone . At the beaches , waves are expected to be 3 to 5 feet . Forecasters don ' t expect any rain for the county in the next few days , as several storms from the Pacific_Ocean will move inland across the Rocky Mountains rather than over Southern California .
