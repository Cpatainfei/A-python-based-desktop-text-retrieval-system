   <HEADLINE> PARTNERS IN RECOVERY ; WHEN BREAST_CANCER STRIKES , THE WOMAN IS NOT A LONE VICTIM . ORANGE COUNTY COUPLES SHARE HOW A MAN CAN OFFER SUPPORT IN A RELATIONSHIP WHILE COPING WITH HIS OWN FEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To the mourners at her father ' s funeral , Lynn Barlow was a wonder . Although she had lost both her father and her breast to cancer in a span of three months , she was bearing_up without any signs of strain . Her doctor had told her husband , Rich , that the quiet stoicism might crack . But as the months wore_on , there was no sign of it . &quot; I was beginning to be confident we weren ' t going_to have a low low -- a bottom_out , &quot; he said . &quot; But when it hit , it was like a bomb went off. &quot; Rich came_home one day , eight months after Lynn ' s mastectomy , to what looked_like ground zero . Lynn had emptied her closet and strewn her clothes throughout the house . She was huddled on their bed , sobbing uncontrollably . It took a tranquilizer to calm her enough so that she could speak , he said . &quot; She said : ' I ' m not a whole person . How can you love me ? Why do you love me ? ' &quot; In the months that followed , the Barlows , who live_in Aliso Viejo , struggled to keep their marriage intact . Like other couples , they came_to realize that breast_cancer not only invades a woman ' s body and endangers her life . The disease also can destroy a woman ' s self-image and her confidence . And it can strain a relationship to the breaking point . While it is the woman who has cancer , her partner also faces some of its effects . He is afraid she will die . He ' s unsure how to respond to her range of emotions as she copes_with her illness . He feels compelled to be stalwart and rock-ribbed , even when he is terrified . And , finally , he has to confront how he feels about the woman ' s body , transformed by surgery and chemotherapy . &quot; It ' s hell for her , but him too , &quot; said Ron Pepin , 65 , of Anaheim . His wife , Ginny , 65 , had a mastectomy in 1988 and reconstructive surgery a year later . &quot; So many things happen to a woman where the guy doesn ' t understand what the hell to do . It ' s confusion , frustration and fear . It ' s a lack of knowledge and understanding . All that together , you ' ve got a big problem. &quot; It was a problem that led to the formation of a men ' s support group at the Breast Care Center in Orange . Two men whose wives had been treated by the center saw how they benefited from the patient support group and asked if a similar program could be started for men , said Barbara Scott , the center ' s patient educator . The groups began meeting in the fall of 1992 . Once a week , for a month or so , women whose cancer has been diagnosed in the past six months come_to the center with their partners . The couples talk together for about a half-hour , then split into men ' s and women ' s sessions for an hour or more . Then the couples meet again to summarize what ' s been covered that evening . When the formal sessions have concluded , couples can exchange addresses and phone_numbers and continue to meet if they wish , Scott said . &quot; The thing I see most is a fear of saying what you ' re feeling to that other person , &quot; Scott said . &quot; The woman is so busy saying ' I ' m fine , fine ; I ' m going_to be fine , ' that she doesn ' t get_to say , ' I ' m really scared. ' And the man is so busy saying , ' You ' ll be fine , ' that he doesn ' t have the opportunity to say he ' s scared , too . Here they can come_to a safe place and say their deepest feelings in a supportive environment. &quot; Dr. John West , the surgical director of the center , said he urges men to go_to the meetings . &quot; If they don ' t do_it , I lean_on them a little bit , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m now convinced it ' s part of the healing . The males do better ; the relationship does better , and maybe there ' s a survival-rate improvement. &quot; Although men are not known for pouring_out their hearts to strangers , the group setting does_work , said Craig Nattkemper , a psychologist who leads the men ' s sessions . Even if a man doesn ' t talk , he can at least listen and learn that other couples are going_through the same difficulties . Men such_as Pete Wesselink , 48 , of Lemon Heights , attend_to tell the group what they and their wives went_through . Susan Wesselink had a bilateral mastectomy , rigorous chemotherapy and reconstructive surgery in 1990 . &quot; It ' s so valuable for the guys , &quot; Pete said . &quot; It gives them the chance to see how other people have dealt with this thing . If a guy asks , ' What did you do when her hair fell_out ? ' or &quot; How was your love life and did_it bother you that your wife didn ' t have a breast ? ' you give them the benefit of your experience . that ' s been comforting to people. &quot; The groups nearly always talk_about what it means for a couple when a woman loses her breast to cancer . Women and men who ' ve participated in the groups and talked to couples individually agree : It ' s more often the women who think losing a breast makes them less desirable . &quot; It ' s almost a universal response , that when the woman asks about what the loss of a breast means , the man says , ' Hey , it doesn ' t matter , ' &quot; Ron Pepin said . &quot; Most women don ' t buy it. &quot; Wesselink said he understands why that might be . &quot; If you watch TV or go_to the movies , it ' s fairly obvious that it ' s the stereotype that ' s presented : Men are attracted to women because of their breasts , &quot; he said . &quot; And it ' s not just breasts , but the bigger the better. &quot; Wesselink said most men aren ' t as fixated as the media make them out_to be . &quot; It ' s a factor , but you learn to deal with it . You come_to the realization , when you face a life-threatening illness , that there are more important things. &quot; Since Lynn Barlow ' s surgery eight years ago , Rich Barlow , 51 , has talked with some men who don ' t share that opinion . &quot; It ' s almost like they ' re putting their wife on display . . . and to them , it would be like displaying a diamond : You would n ' t want to display one with a flaw , &quot; he said . &quot; To me , it ' s very shallow . Those two pieces of flesh in the front of a lady have nothing to do with her brain or her heart. &quot; But even when a man sincerely tells a woman that the breast doesn ' t matter , it can take a year or longer for a woman to believe it , Nattkemper said . It was extremely difficult for Marie Lussenden , 58 , of Anaheim . She had a breast removed in 1991 and resisted reconstructive surgery because she was &quot; so petrified of dying &quot; that she couldn ' t even think_about it . In chemotherapy , she lost every strand of her body hair , including eyelashes . &quot; Seeing your body with only one breast is bad enough , &quot; she said . &quot; Losing you hair is another psychological blow. &quot; To top things off , she gained 40 pounds . Her husband , Dale , saw her through all_of it . Her voice still catches as she praises him as &quot; the biggest gift in my life. &quot; &quot; He would say wonderful things : ' I didn ' t marry you for your breast ; I don ' t care if you weigh 500 pounds ; I love the Marie inside. ' But to me , I was hideous , &quot; she said . &quot; All I could do was put my arms around her and hold her , &quot; said Dale , 50 . &quot; Sometimes we said nothing . I guess I treated her the way I would have wanted to be treated. &quot; The couple still is coping_with the changes cancer has wrought . Marie said tamoxifen , the drug she takes_to ward_off the recurrence of breast_cancer , has reduced her sex_drive . And she still fights the feeling that if she hates her body , her husband must , too . &quot; But things are getting better , &quot; she said . Not every relationship survives the buffeting that breast_cancer inflicts . Pepin knows of one recent situation where a woman ' s fiance left her after hearing that her cancer recurred . In such situations , Wesselink said , &quot; you want to take the guy in the other room and knock his block_off . &quot; But you can ' t force someone to care_for someone . In my opinion , something was wrong before. &quot; Susan Wesselink , 47 , agreed . &quot; They say that relationships that aren ' t strong have a difficult time surviving adversity , &quot; she said . &quot; Ours was good to begin with , and one of the gifts of cancer was that it made_it stronger. &quot; She calls her husband &quot; Prince Pete &quot; for his approach to her illness . He shared nearly every step of treatment with her -- from reading her books on healing and attending all her chemotherapy sessions to shaving her head so that she would n ' t have to watch hair fall_out in clumps every day . &quot; We both stood there in the bathroom , crying , cutting hair , &quot; he said . Ginny Pepin said she and Ron also found that her illness brought them closer . &quot; In 40 years of marriage , although you get_along , you sort of take each other for granted , &quot; she said . &quot; When this happens , it makes you realize how special life is and how much you appreciate one another. &quot; The Barlows couldn ' t agree more . Lynn ' s illness tested their marriage , they said , but it also made them see the depth of their commitment . Lynn , who had her other breast removed in 1987 as a precaution and then underwent reconstructive surgery for both breasts , finally realized that Rich meant it when he said he loved her for the heart inside her chest , not what was in front of it . &quot; Aren ' t I lucky ? &quot; Lynn asked . &quot; I ' m the lucky one , &quot; Rich replied . &quot; You came around. &quot; Where to Get Help * The men ' s support group at the Breast_Cancer Center in Orange is also available to those who are not patients_of the center .
