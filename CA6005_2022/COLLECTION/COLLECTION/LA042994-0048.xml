   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON NUCLEAR DISASTER ; NO PEACE FOR CHERNOBYL ' S VICTIMS ; THERE IS MORE SICKNESS , MORE DEATH AND THE CONSTANT THREAT THAT ANOTHER SOVIET-ERA REACTOR WILL BLOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This week marks the eighth anniversary of Chernobyl , the nuclear disaster that spewed 50 tons of radioactive particles ( 10 times the fallout of Hiroshima ) . The world ' s memory of Chernobyl has dimmed , its focus moved to other places in harm ' s way , like Rwanda and Bosnia . But for people living_in the contaminated areas of Ukraine , Belarus and western Russia , the accident continues to wreak consequences whose danger and immensity could not have been imagined before the explosion . The small republic of Belarus was hardest hit by the catastrophe . The Chernobyl nuclear-power plant is in Ukraine , but the reactor that exploded during the night of April 26 , 1986 , is only 10 miles from the Belarusian border . The lethally radioactive cloud that was emitted passed first over Belarus ; 70 % of the radioactive matter ejected by the explosion fell there . Nearly half of Belarus ' 10 million people are still living_in contaminated areas and we are just beginning to see the devastating results . There has been an astronomical increase in thyroid cancer , especially among Belarusian children , with 237 cases diagnosed since the Chernobyl accident . About a dozen of the stricken children have already died . Under normal circumstances , the incidence of thyroid cancer in children younger than 15 is infinitesimal , on the order of one per million per year . Other cancers , anemias , immune disorders and respiratory illnesses have also increased considerably in the affected regions of Ukraine , Belarus and Russia . Birth_rates have dropped , due in part to the fear of genetic problems , and there is an increase in infants with Down ' s syndrome . In addition , there have been horrific mutations in humans , animals and plants , including livestock born with extra legs and other body_parts and children born with missing limbs and skulls . The harm of the radiation was multiplied because irradiated food_products were distributed throughout the Soviet_Union . Today , eight years after the explosion , potatoes , grains , cucumbers , onions , leafy green vegetables and fruit continue to be grown on highly contaminated land . Some farms in Ukraine and Belarus that were officially shut_down continue to harvest grain ; local officials even collect taxes on the produce . People know that the meat and vegetables they cultivate are poisonous , but not to eat them can mean going hungry . Western experts believe that all three types of Soviet-designed nuclear_reactors , especially the 15 Chernobyl-style reactors still operating in the former Soviet_Union , are dangerously flawed and that another catastrophe is almost inevitable . But economic hardships , a lack of hard currency and energy shortages have forced the newly independent states of the former Soviet_Union to continue depending_on nuclear_energy . Since the 1986 disaster at the No . 4 reactor , there have been four fires and one water leak at the still-functioning Chernobyl units . There were also two &quot; incidents &quot; -- irregularities of function due_to safety defects -- just last week . In 1992 , there were 205 reported incidents at energy plants in the former Soviet_Union , a rise of 19 % over the previous year . In March , 1994 , the Russian Federal Nuclear and Radiation Safety Oversight Committee reported 20 # 000 safety violations for 1993 . On April 8 , Ukraine said that it would shut_down Chernobyl , but two weeks later told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it can ' t afford to do so . Chernobyl alone generates 7 % of the country ' s electricity . Among Chernobyl ' s most tragic victims are the so-called liquidators , the 600 # 000 young cleanup workers -- mostly soldiers , coal_miners and army veterans -- who were sent_in shifts over three years to the disaster site without protective clothing . They buried chunks of radioactive graphite blown_out of the reactor and built a &quot; permanent &quot; concrete sarcophagus that is already dangerously ineffective . Health monitoring is poor , but more_than 7 # 000 of the young_men , whose average age is 29 , are reported to have died of causes related to Chernobyl ; up_to 80 % of the others are said to suffer from spinal-cord disorders , nerve damage and psychological problems . A spokesman for the Russian government ' s Chernobyl committee revealed last year that 18 % of the men who have died -- about 1 # 250 people -- committed suicide , unable to cope_with radiation effects . Then there are the indirect victims , among them the &quot; squatters &quot; who have returned to their contaminated , abandoned villages to live_out their lives rather than face ostracism as &quot; Chernobyl goblins. &quot; Evacuees from Chernobyl ' s irradiated regions have been shunned and discriminated against . In addition to inflicting immense suffering , the Chernobyl disaster has also spawned numerous scams , many of them involving Western humanitarian aid . In one such cheating operation , bureaucrats in the Bryansk region of Russia sent their own children , instead of sick Chernobyl youngsters , to Western summer_camps . Chernobyl has even given_rise to poisoned values among children . Eight-year-old leukemia victim Pasha , who was born a month before the Chernobyl disaster in Gomel , Belarus , told a visiting journalist in his hospital_room : &quot; I like to eat everything with radiation . Without radiation , it doesn ' t taste good. &quot;</TEXT>
