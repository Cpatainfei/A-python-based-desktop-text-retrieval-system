   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; MAD AND GLAD OVER NAFTA ; AS SUMMIT DELEGATES GATHER TO PONDER THE HEMISPHERE ' S ECONOMY , THEY WILL BE LOOKING_AT THE TRADE ACCORD ' S FIRST YEAR . SO FAR , IT HAS SPARKED CONTROVERSY , CONFUSION AND SOME SURPRISING OPPORTUNITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you want to know how sticky free_trade can get these days -- literally -- just ask the guys at Burlington Northern Railroad about the green goop . The brouhaha erupted earlier this year , when Mexican officials decreed that U.S. corn shipments be dyed green . Trade deal or no , this was business : The dye helps Mexicans track American corn in their restricted market , and the rule stands , despite American complaints . &quot; In many cases , the corn colored the inside of the rail cars green , &quot; said Rusty Jesser , a spokesman for Burlington Northern , explaining why the railroad will no longer carry the gooey grain . As heads_of_state from North and South_America gather Friday in Miami to consider closer economic ties , a towering precedent will loom over their summit : the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , now approaching its first birthday . By many gauges , free_trade has been good medicine for the North_American economy and an instructive lesson for the entire hemisphere . Yet a close look_at one year ' s experience with NAFTA shows how profoundly the world of commerce can vary from the world of political rhetoric and cold statistics . Neither the burning fears nor extravagant expectations sparked by the pact have been borne_out since it took_effect Jan . 1 . ( It will , of course , take years to determine NAFTA ' s true effect on jobs , industries and the economies of North America. ) Some rules have led to controversy , red_tape and confusion , with the green-corn flap as only one example . Others have opened_up surprising opportunities . Tomato farmers in Florida are mad . Sausage exporters in Illinois are glad . And amid the fears of organized labor , union jobs in a Whittier factory have expanded . The nitty gritty of international trade , in other words , has proved to be a much quirkier process than the idealized image that emerges from global summits . &quot; Most people thought NAFTA meant ' Put the stuff in my truck and cross the border , ' &quot; notes Ross E . Porter , a customs adviser , recalling how one frustrated American merchant finally gave_up on shipping low-cost bathing_suits into Mexico after a series of delays . It ' s not that easy , he says . So , as delegates gather_in Miami , the NAFTA experience offers some points to keep_in mind as they sketch an economic future for the hemisphere : * NAFTA ' s greatest significance is symbolic , its very existence a security_blanket for American executives spooked by Mexico ' s uncertain business culture . The reductions in import taxes , however sweet , are less important than the reductions in fear . &quot; If you ' re going to pick a country ( with vast potential ) , Mexico is the one , &quot; declares Richard J . Heckmann , chairman of U.S. Filter Corp . in Palm Desert . &quot; But without NAFTA you ' re scared to death of it. &quot; * Free_trade isn ' t free . Mexican avocado growers , U.S. cherry farmers and Canadian peanut-butter makers are a_few of the parties unhappy with restrictions imposed by their next-door neighbors . * NAFTA ' s short-term benefits , while real , may be exaggerated by the economic recovery that is stimulating exports and investment throughout North_America . Certainly , the pact is far-reaching : Tariffs are being phased_out over the next 15 years , as the three neighbors try to make their business laws and standards much more harmonious . Yet the real action is concentrated in Mexico , an economy of breathtaking potential that only now is edging toward the free-market practices of the United States and Canada . The post-NAFTA hassles of doing business in Mexico pale in comparison to the not-so-old days when bureaucratic caprice turned export efforts into a helter-skelter gamble . To get the flavor , consider the seemingly mundane matter of clothing labels . U.S. exporters used to wonder , &quot; Did labels have to be attached ? Did they have to be sewn on ? Did they have to be stuck_on ? Could you put them side_by_side with the freight ? There were as_many different answers as there were ports_of_entry , &quot; recalls Porter , marketing manager at Porter International in San Diego . The trade deal should ease the confusion by answering those nettlesome questions : &quot; With NAFTA the red-tape burdens are sometimes a problem -- but at least they ' re dependable. &quot; Throughout North_America , investors and executives are teaming_up in joint_ventures , scrambling for product distributors across the border and exhibiting a fresh interest in neighboring countries . Trade among the three nations is galloping at record levels . &quot; Eleven months ago we had only four people in Mexico , &quot; says Carlos J . Valderrama , director of Latin_American operations for the Carlsmith Ball law_firm in Los Angeles , which advises clients on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border . &quot; Now we have 16. &quot; Doing business in other countries is not always for the faint of heart . Trade provisions can have pull-your-hair-out complexity -- and none is more important than the rule that products must be made in North_America to qualify for lower tariffs . Sound simple ? At Alesis , a Los Angeles manufacturer of studio electronics equipment , the made-in-North America proviso has triggered a time-consuming research project devoted to figuring_out if a digital audio tape_recorder with hundreds of components passes NAFTA muster . &quot; When NAFTA passed I jumped_for_joy , thinking we would n ' t have to pay duties in Mexico , and we ' d be even more competitive , &quot; recalled Mark Frederick , international sales manager for the company . &quot; When we looked_at the paperwork , I was really disappointed. &quot; In any case , the growing demand by Mexican musicians for Alesis ' ADAT audio tape_recorder underscores a larger point about NAFTA : It is a catalyst to an ongoing process . International trade inside North_America is burgeoning anyway . &quot; We ' ve been growing in Mexico 30 % to 35 % the last few years -- NAFTA or no NAFTA , &quot; Frederick points_out . For others , however , NAFTA is of paramount importance , a reassuring sign that the United States and Mexico have committed themselves to a new relationship . The commitment , rather than the fine print , is what prompted these executives to take a fresh look south of the border . And the rewards are starting to flow back . &quot; Mexico was last on my list of places to go , &quot; concedes Raymond W . Cohen , a vice_president with Diagnostic Monitoring Systems , a maker of medical software in Orange County . Before NAFTA , that is . This year , the Orange County firm projects that Mexican sales could reach $ 50 # 000 -- up from zero_in 1993 . &quot; Specifically because of NAFTA , I said , ' This is a good time for us to do some business in Mexico , ' &quot; Cohen says . Not that trade wrangles have vanished into the past . U.S. restrictions on avocados have angered Mexicans , and Mexican restrictions affecting apples , cherries and plums have frustrated Americans . Florida ' s tomato growers were infuriated earlier this year by what they considered massive dumping of low-cost tomatoes from Mexico . And don ' t forget the Canadians : They want to ship a lot more wheat , sugar and tobacco to the United States than U.S. officials allow . But for all that , trade is humming . Even U.S. corn exports to Mexico are up dramatically ( almost tenfold ) under NAFTA , despite the green-dye rule that aims to keep corn for animal feed separate from corn for consumers -- protecting Mexico ' s highly subsidized corn industry in the process . &quot; We continue to look_at Mexico as a good customer , &quot; says Richard R . Calhoun , an assistant vice_president with Cargill , a giant grain company in Minneapolis . Meanwhile , one year after organized labor lost a furious fight to stop NAFTA , the employment impact looks modest in a U.S. economy that has 115 million non-farm jobs . The Labor_Department has approved special benefits for only 13 # 496 casualties of the trade accord so far . Requests have been received from 286 companies in 40 states , including 17 firms in California . While the Clinton_Administration claims a gain of 100 # 000 jobs , the Joint Economic Committee of Congress estimated a net loss of 10 # 000 , and some insist that the jobs deficit is much higher . The harshest criticism goes beyond numbers , however . NAFTA , its opponents maintain , has given employers a potent new lever to use on workers and politicians , in_effect letting them say : Don ' t make waves or we ' ll shift production to Mexico . While no massive shifts have occurred so far , the game is in its early stages . &quot; What the serious critics of NAFTA said was that this would be part of a general downward trend in_labor standards and environmental_conditions , &quot; said Dean Baker , an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington . &quot; And everything we ' ve seen bears this out. &quot; Most experts are more enthusiastic . Free_trade , goes the mainstream thinking , is bringing North_Americans a greater choice of goods and services , making the entire continent more productive and providing a downward pressure on prices . &quot; In any trade agreement some people will lose their jobs and some people will gain jobs , &quot; said Kurt E . Karl , an economist with the WEFA Group near Philadelphia . &quot; The big news is that prices go_down and consumers are the winners. &quot; Well-paid union workers should be at the top of the losers ' list , according to common wisdom . Yet in another of NAFTA ' s anomalies the real_world of business offers various examples to the contrary . At U.S. Filter , a major manufacturer of water-treatment systems , 1994 has been a banner year for Mexican business : a sewage treatment system for the city of Cuernavaca ( in which the California company is investing $ 20 million ) and water_systems at a new Chrysler plant and the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Mexico_City . And all that work has prompted a flurry of hiring north of the border . &quot; The engineering is done_in Pittsburgh . The construction is done_in Whittier and Rockford ( Ill. ) And the installation is in Mexico , &quot; explains Heckmann , company chairman . The Whittier plant , for instance , has added about 30 employees this year , largely because of the demand from Mexico . They are mostly welders and assembly workers who belong_to the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and are paid on average $ 13 an hour plus benefits . The Mexicans &quot; need our help , and we need their business , &quot; said Heckmann , a fervent NAFTA supporter who travels_to Mexico once a month . &quot; To me it ' s the perfect combination. &quot; Many companies , meanwhile , prefer to furnish Mexican customers with products made in the United States . Amir A . Moghadam , owner of a lingerie factory , looks_forward to rising sales in Mexico for his Parisa label . But he believes it pays_off to keep the sewing_machines right outside his office in Van Nuys where he can walk to the floor in seconds if a problem emerges . &quot; Everyone ' s telling me to go there and open_up a factory , but I have no intention , &quot; said Moghadam , president of AFT Apparel International . As some see it , post-NAFTA ferment is leading inevitably to even more ferment , as the process of trade liberalization settles over increasingly large regions of the Western_Hemisphere and the whole world . The forecast is for new headaches , new opportunities and an increasingly integrated global economy , dramatized by the Summit of the Americas . &quot; It ' s not a new status_quo , &quot; declares Van R . Whiting Jr. , a senior fellow at UC San Diego ' s Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies . Rather , he continued , NAFTA has sparked &quot; a continuing process of new problems and solutions. &quot; Keith Heard , executive_vice_president of the National Corn Growers Assn . -- which continues to protest the green-dye requirement -- puts it simply : &quot; The only people that you don ' t have trade problems with are the folks that you don ' t trade with. &quot; BACKGROUND The North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which took_effect Jan . 1 , phases_out over the next 15 years tariffs and other barriers to the movement of goods , services and investment among the United States , Mexico and Canada . The pact creates the world ' s largest trading bloc , covering more_than 360 million people .</TEXT>
