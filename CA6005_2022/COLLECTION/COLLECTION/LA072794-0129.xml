   <HEADLINE> UCLA GRADE_SCHOOL WEIGHS SEEKING CHARTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For much of its 112-year history , the prestigious , sometimes-criticized elementary_school on the UCLA campus has been a place where some of the nation ' s foremost educators tried_out their ideas . Many hallmarks of today ' s education reform_movement -- including mixed-age classes , team teaching and cooperative , hands-on learning -- have long been mainstays at the Seeds University Elementary School . Now officials of one the nation ' s few remaining university-run &quot; laboratory &quot; schools are considering applying for a state charter , a move that would put UES at the forefront of yet another innovation . It also would alter the course of this unique institution , often faulted for its likeness to elite private campuses , by turning it into a truly public_school . The fledgling charter school movement , which is rapidly catching_on in California and several other reform-minded states , grants selected campuses great autonomy in their efforts to improve student achievement . Once their ideas have been approved by the local school_board or the state , such schools are allowed to make their own decisions about everything from course offerings to hours of operation to staffing . The charter move would allow UES financial stability . Currently a hybrid that is neither fully public nor fully private , the school is funded partly by the UCLA chancellor ' s office -- public money -- but it charges tuition and is free to decide which students to take . If it becomes a charter school , it could count_on the same per-pupil financing as other public_schools and would be required to eliminate tuition , now up_to $ 5 # 000 a year . Because of special legislation passed_on its behalf , however , UES would not have to be affiliated with a school district , as other charter schools are . Along with the money would come the uncertainties that go_with a new partnership -- in this case , the state_Department of Education , which would issue the charter . Also , the school would need to find ways to make_up the difference between the state financing and the higher costs of operating UES . The charter proposal comes as university officials are trying to broaden the lab school ' s role in efforts to overhaul American education . At the same time , the state ' s continuing recession and the resulting budget_cuts in its college and university systems have forced the lab school to increase tuition and step_up private fund-raising_campaigns . Over a five-year period , the UCLA chancellor ' s office is withdrawing its $ 1-million annual cash subsidy -- half of UES ' yearly budget . With a charter , allowed_in California since January , 1993 , the lab school could keep most of its crucial freedom from Department_of_Education rules and regulations while receiving state financing as a public_school . It also could help light the way for those public campuses beginning to grapple with issues raised by their newfound independence . &quot; We never thought_about the charter as an answer to the budget problem but as a way to connect more clearly to the public_schools , to become directly a part of that system , &quot; said Theodore Mitchell , dean of the UCLA Graduate_School of Education , which oversees the campus elementary_school . Yet Mitchell acknowledged that university budget_cuts , which have led to steady annual climbs in lab school tuition , &quot; certainly focused attention &quot; on the school ' s need to resolve how best to fulfill its mission while maintaining a quality education for an increasingly diverse group of students . For years , UES , tucked into an exquisite , redwood-studded plot with a creek along Sunset Boulevard , has worked to provide research , develop innovations in instruction and disseminate proven methods that are relevant to public_schools . Its reputation and location in affluent Westwood ensure it far more applicants than it can accept , despite steadily rising tuitions . Its students ' parents tend to be very involved . Many make extraordinary efforts to get their children to the school , which does not provide transportation , and to adjust their schedules to the high number of pupil-free days set_aside for faculty_members to plan lessons together and update their skills . All this has cost UES some credibility among public_school faculties . &quot; I ' ve received too many comments from teachers and principals saying , ' You just don ' t know what it ' s like out here. ' Their view is that you can ' t do much of this as a public_school , &quot; said Deborah Stipek , UCLA professor of education and director of UES . But there are drawbacks to going public , and the proposal is sparking passionate debate . &quot; When you begin talking_about people ' s children , it ' s amazing how emotional things can get , &quot; said John Brice , the father of a UES 7-year-old and one of three presidents of the Family School Alliance , the lab school ' s equivalent of the PTA . &quot; There is a range of reactions from parents , and the range of concern varies from family to family , &quot; said Brice , who attended UES as a child and is_well acquainted with the strong , protective feelings the school stirs in its families and alumni . * Financing is a major concern . As a public_school , UES would not be allowed to charge tuition or other fees to make_up the difference between its share of tax dollars and the costs of running the lab school , which are higher in part because of the research and workshops conducted there . As a tuition-charging school , however , it is harder to attract very poor children , who are attending California public_schools in increasing numbers . Some parents feel increased fund-raising_efforts detract from the school ' s &quot; egalitarian &quot; atmosphere and put too_much emphasis on money . The longevity of the charter schools experiment is another concern . Each charter lasts only five years and prospects for renewal of the program are unclear . Another concern is educational quality , especially since UES costs more_than the average public_school . &quot; In general , people who come_to UES see it as a place that is terrifically sensitive to children . . . . Whether you have a lot of money or little money , they do a great job . It ' s a marvelous environment , &quot; said Brice , who added that he sees broad agreement on such goals as further increasing student diversity and broadening the school ' s role in education reforms . &quot; The issue is , how do we get there ? This is not an easy decision. &quot; Change -- often precipitated by crisis -- is not unusual for the lab school that began Downtown in 1882 as a teacher training institution at the Los Angeles Central Library . It affiliated with UCLA in 1919 and moved onto the Westwood campus in 1947 . Corinne A . Seeds , its namesake and progressive principal from 1925 to 1957 , raised hackles with some of her projects : having her students send materials to Japanese American students in internment_camps during World_War_II and teaching about Russia during the Cold_War . Seeds ' successors , including some of the best-known education leaders of their time , put their own stamps on the school . Team teaching and multi-age grouping came_in while John Goodlad was director , and during Madeline Hunter ' s 20-year tenure as principal there was an emphasis on developing teacher skill as the key to a student ' s academic achievement . In 1989 , UCLA Chancellor Charles E . Young proposed moving UES off campus and giving it to the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District . The following year , after strong opposition from lab school parents and alumni , he agreed to keep the facility on campus but told officials the school must sharpen its focus_on research and dissemination to ensure its future with the university . UES officials have tried to do that , in part by diversifying the enrollment so that it better reflects the ethnic and economic mix_in California ' s public_schools . About half the 462 students receive financial_aid and 36 % have annual family incomes of less than $ 35 # 000 . Almost 12 % come from families earning $ 250 # 000 or more . Half are white , nearly 16 % are Latino , 14 % are African American and 11 % are Asian ; some are just learning English . The school has held workshops for thousands of California teachers and administrators , forged partnerships with three Los Angeles Unified School District elementary campuses , assisted with the development of state curriculum guides and engaged in research projects , ranging from classroom assessment practices to home and school effects on Latino students ' academic achievement . Mitchell , the education school dean , said UES has proved &quot; there is a great need for a lab-school-like environment where we can take our experience and make the transition between research and practice a smoother and shorter one. &quot; He said he views the charter debate -- which probably will not be decided until the fall -- as primarily &quot; a technical set of questions about how we can best continue to pursue the UES mission. &quot; Unlike the 1989 debate , Mitchell added , &quot; this is not about whether UES should continue and what it will look_like . . . . I think we are all_in fundamental agreement on the ( goal ) and are trying to work_out the means. &quot;</TEXT>
