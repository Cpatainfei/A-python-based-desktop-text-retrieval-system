   <TEXT> Edyta Starosta ' s athletic build and smiling face belie the fact that she ' s a speed freak . Now six weeks into rehabilitation at the Monar drug treatment center in this village south of Warsaw , the 20-year-old says her experiences with illegal drugs terrified her . She started with marijuana two years ago and moved_on to amphetamines at the beginning of this year because &quot; I needed something stronger. &quot; But , she says , &quot; it turns_out there wasn ' t anything good in it. &quot; She enjoyed the buzz the speed gave her in the beginning , but soon began having suicidal thoughts , hallucinations and memory_loss . &quot; It was just terrifying , &quot; she recalls , and she admits the pull of the drugs is still strong . &quot; I know if I left here now , I would begin taking them again. &quot; Edyta and tens of thousands of other young Poles have begun using illegal drugs since communism collapsed here in 1989 and the country ' s borders became more porous . The adoption of Western ways , relaxed penalties and changing European drug-traffic patterns have all contributed to the outbreak . &quot; There is a very visible drug boom going_on in Poland , &quot; says Marek Kotanski , founder of the 23 Monar centers and a pioneer in drug treatment in the days when the Communist government insisted Poland had no drug problem . &quot; It ' s a very threatening phenomenon. &quot; As a drug_user and dealer , Jarek Skopowski , 23 , has witnessed the boom firsthand . &quot; In Poland and especially in Warsaw more and more people are addicted , &quot; he says . &quot; There ' s a terrible invasion of amphetamines and their price has fallen drastically . There ' s a renaissance of LSD being brought from Holland. &quot; Every illegal drug is available in Poland . The only one that ' s not popular , Skopowski says , is cocaine -- simply because it ' s too expensive . Studies show that while about 7 % of Polish teen-agers admitted using drugs in the 1970s and 1980s , the figure is now more_than 25 % . Police blame the drug boom on increased availability and lower prices , but sociologists say the reasons run much deeper . Janus Sieroslawski , who has studied drug use in Poland , points to &quot; the consequences of the process of profound changes &quot; unleashed since 1989 when Poland shed 44 years of communism , began building capitalism and democracy and adopted Western lifestyles . Poles have experienced &quot; a crisis of norms and values , weakening of social_control , unemployment ( and ) psychological stress &quot; since the 1989 upheaval . These factors , Sieroslawski said , encourage many to escape into &quot; pharmacologically induced oblivion. &quot; Poles have long appeared to have a self-destructive streak . They have been notorious abusers of alcohol , and with the adoption of Western ways , glamorously packaged bottles of foreign booze are flooding the Polish market . But drug-treatment pioneer Kotanski thinks Western influences are too facile an explanation . He points instead to change-of-system stresses . &quot; With the economic transformation , every family is in a constant chase for money , &quot; he said . &quot; There is great frustration because of the discrepancy between great expectations and the reality . We are still unprepared for quick changes. &quot; Certainly Polish customs officials were unprepared for the influx of drugs after war broke_out in the former Yugoslav federation in June , 1991 , cutting_off traditional trucking routes to Western Europe from Turkey , Asia and Africa . Lax laws and inexperienced customs officers made Eastern Europe a paradise for drug smugglers . Because Communist border security had been so tight , and punishment for criminal offenses so harsh , practically no one smuggled drugs into the region before 1989 . Longtime isolation from the West also meant there was little , if any , cooperation with more sophisticated police_forces and customs authorities in Western Europe . In addition , most East European_countries emerged from the Communist era without any laws against possession and use of drugs . &quot; A policeman stops a drug dealer with eight kilograms ( 17.6 pounds ) of amphetamines on him , as happened last year in Szczecin , and can ' t do anything , &quot; complained Bogdan Zielinski , Poland ' s top narcotics police_officer . &quot; We arrested him , but then had to release him and apologize . Such a situation would not have taken_place anywhere else in the world. &quot; Police are further hamstrung in their attempts to fight drug trafficking because undercover operations , drug buys and sting operations are all illegal , although the Polish government is moving to change the law . Of all_the East European_countries , Poland emerged as a favorite transit route for drug smuggling because of its seaports . A series of recent drug seizures confirm Poland ' s heightened role in world drug-smuggling : * In January , Polish customs officers seized 1 # 140 pounds of cocaine worth $ 45 million in a ship ' s cargo of bananas . * Working with Polish authorities , British customs officers intercepted 2 # 640 pounds of cocaine being smuggled by ship from South_America to Poland via Liverpool in February . &quot; Polish ports are now the main entrance for cocaine to Europe , &quot; said Maciej Lubik , a top Polish customs official . * That same month , Polish authorities confiscated about 200 gallons of a crucial ingredient of amphetamines disguised as ketchup coming from Bulgaria . Poland has become a center for the manufacture of black-market amphetamines for export to Scandinavia and Germany . * In May , Polish customs officers seized 88 pounds of heroin worth $ 3.2 million being smuggled to Germany in two cars . This first seizure of drugs on their way_out of Poland led police to suspect a narcotics packing_plant had been set_up within the country to serve Western Europe . As for curbing drug_abuse , Kotanski is pessimistic . &quot; There is no drug prevention in Poland , &quot; he says flatly . &quot; I don ' t see any forces on the scene who are seriously interested in dealing with this situation properly. &quot;</TEXT>
