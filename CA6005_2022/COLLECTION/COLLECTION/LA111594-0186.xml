   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; IN PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES , ARAFAT IS LOSING GROUND ; MIDEAST : THE PLO LEADER FACES CRITICISM FROM ALL SIDES . THAT HAS ISRAEL WORRIED ABOUT HIS ABILITY TO KEEP CONTROL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In both the Gaza Strip , where he now resides , and the West_Bank , where he hopes one day to rule , PLO leader Yasser Arafat ' s political fortunes are in a state of steep decline . Even within Fatah , his own faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization , Arafat faces increasingly harsh criticism for his handling of negotiations with Israel and his running of the Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho . Arafat is being blamed for everything from Israel ' s repeated closure of the territories to a recent outbreak of cholera in the Gaza Strip . About 60 cases of the highly infectious_disease were reported this month before doctors in Gaza finally declared Monday that it was under_control . &quot; People do expect too_much of Arafat , &quot; said Amin Makbool , a member of the Fatah Higher Committee for the West_Bank , in an interview in Nablus . &quot; The situation is hard , and people expect more_than he can deliver . The nature of the revolution meant that we had to depend_on the sole decision of the leader . Now , we need also the input of institutions , which we still lack . So everything has to go_back to the leader , and he ' s only human . He makes mistakes. &quot; Watching nervously from the sidelines is the Israeli government -- concerned that the man they are making_peace with may_not be able to maintain his grip on Palestinian society . &quot; The Palestinian Authority ' s ability to manage properly the Gaza Strip is very important to us , &quot; said Ephraim Sneh , Israel ' s minister of health and a former head of the civil administration in the West_Bank . &quot; We definitely want them to succeed , because their failure is the victory of Hamas. &quot; Hamas , a militant Islamic group , is Arafat ' s strongest opposition . Seeking to illustrate that he still controls the PLO ' s most important institution , Arafat announced last week that , for the first time , the PLO ' s 15-member Executive Committee will meet in Gaza . But within days , eight members declared that they will not attend the session , scheduled for today . The Executive Committee is the supreme governing body of the PLO , bringing_together the various factions . It has been largely inactive since Arafat moved to Gaza in July and formed a governing authority there to run daily life . Among those who say they will stay_away_from today ' s meeting are two veteran Fatah leaders -- Farouk Kaddoumi , Arafat ' s de_facto minister of foreign affairs , and Mahmoud Abbas , a founding member of Fatah who oversaw the PLO ' s secret negotiations with Israel that led to the Oslo accords . They continue to run offices in Tunis , the capital_of_Tunisia -- Arafat ' s former headquarters -- and refuse to move to the territories . But Arafat ' s troubles are not confined to disgruntled officials living outside the territories . In the West_Bank , Arafat was faced 10 days ago with the first elections to local Fatah councils , organized without his support . During Israel ' s occupation , Fatah councils , always appointed by Arafat , provided clandestine , grass-roots support for the faction . The councils recruited members , disbursed funds and carried_out activities in the territories . A year ago , after Israel and the PLO declared mutual recognition , Fatah activity in the West_Bank and Gaza became legal . Local activists soon began to say that Arafat ' s method of appointing loyalists was outmoded , that Fatah needed to elect councils that could transform the guerrilla faction into a political_party . So Fatah activists in the West_Bank organized elections . The first was held_in Ramallah . It produced two elected councils . Reformers in Fatah hailed the development as the first_step toward democratizing the faction and reshaping its mission . Arafat , however , sent no congratulations to the new councils . And this week , Fatah announced the &quot; postponement &quot; of other elections scheduled across the West_Bank . The reason given was technical difficulties . But sources within Fatah said that Arafat was displeased with the elections in Ramallah , where many former prisoners known to oppose him gained seats on the two councils . Even as he faces problems within Fatah , Arafat also is edging closer to confrontation with Islamic militants in Gaza . On Monday , Arafat ordered his police_force to arrest more leaders of the extremist Islamic Jihad group and to ban public demonstrations . The edict on demonstrations forced Jihad to scale_down a march planned for Monday afternoon . Under the watchful eyes of hundreds of Palestinian police , militants mourned the death of Hisham Hamad , a 21-year-old suicide bomber who pedaled his explosives-laden bicycle into an Israeli checkpoint in Gaza on Friday . Palestinian officials have had enough of Jihad ' s public muscle-flexing . On Friday , Jihad called thousands of supporters into the street to mourn the death of Hani Abed , a Jihad activist killed in a car bombing in southern Gaza on Nov . 2 . Their march began shortly before Hamad blew himself up along with three Israeli reserve army_officers . Jihad said that Hamad ' s attack was revenge for Abed ' s death -- for which they blame the Israelis . Sprinkled throughout the mourners at Friday ' s demonstration were young_men wearing white sheets -- symbolizing their willingness to become martyrs by carrying_out suicide attacks -- and masked men who fired Kalashnikov rifles into the air and chanted slogans against Israel , the United States and Arafat . Arafat continues to make overtures to the militants , however . Last week , he appointed two Hamas supporters as members of the religious courts in Gaza and the West_Bank , and he has met with political_leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad . He is trying to walk an increasingly fine line , his supporters say , between drawing Islamic militants and their supporters into the political process and preventing their military wings from destroying his fragile negotiations with Israel .</TEXT>
