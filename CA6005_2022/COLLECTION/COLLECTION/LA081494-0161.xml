   <HEADLINE> SANTA MONICA AIRPORT NEIGHBORS TO AIR COMPLAINTS ; AIRCRAFT : THREE FATAL CRASHES ADD URGENCY TO RESIDENTS ' CALLS FOR TIGHTER FLIGHT CONTROLS . THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL_OFFICIALS AT A COMMUNITY MEETING TUESDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It didn ' t take three planes tumbling from the sky to get the attention of neighbors of the Santa Monica Airport . Residents have complained for years about noise from planes landing and taking_off , while pilots , for their part , have tried to explain the safety precautions they take and the inevitability of noise from what is one of the nation ' s busiest single-runway airports . But three fatal crashes in the past nine months have given the issue even more urgency . At a community meeting Tuesday night , residents will have the opportunity to share their concerns with local and federal_officials , who plan to discuss recent safety recommendations made by a citizens ' committee created after the most recent crash . The recommendations include increasing pilot education , purchasing new air traffic_control gear and other safety equipment , conducting more aircraft inspections and re-evaluating the process by which residents file complaints concerning the airport . Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and U.S. Rep . Jane Harman ( D-Rolling Hills ) are sponsoring the meeting , which is primarily for residents of Venice and others with complaints about planes taking_off to the west of the airport . Galanter previously held a meeting for residents of Cheviot Hills and other neighborhoods under the flight_path to the east . Galanter said she has received a growing number of complaints about the airport from residents recently . If it ' s true that pilots are flying lower or not following noise-reduction procedures , she said , she will urge the airport and the Federal Aviation Administration to do something about it . &quot; The airport can step_up its educational efforts for the pilots , &quot; she said . &quot; The FAA has a lot of power , if they choose to exercise it. &quot; Harman gave the committee ' s recommendations to FAA officials last week , and she hopes they ' ll respond by Tuesday , said Ed Hatcher , her chief_of_staff . &quot; The requests are very reasonable , &quot; he said . &quot; The residents have very legitimate concerns. &quot; But reconciling them with pilots ' concerns won ' t be easy . For example , under one noise-abatement procedure already in_use at the airport , pilots taking_off to the west must fly over Penmar Golf_Course instead of the surrounding residential streets . One of the committee ' s recommendations is that the airport tell pilots the exact heading to follow over the middle of the golf_course . To overfly the golf_course , however , pilots must turn left as soon as they take_off , then turn_back to the right , said airport manager Tim Walsh . &quot; It ' s a tricky little maneuver , &quot; he said . In fact , outspoken pilot Don Brandsen says it ' s simply not realistic to expect pilots to follow an exact heading over the center of the course . When you take_off from the airport , he said , you ' re busy enough trying to gain altitude and keep_up airspeed &quot; without trying to find_out whether you ' re 12 inches this side of the golf_course or 18 inches to that side of the golf course. &quot; Compliance with the procedure appears marginal . During one 20-minute period on a sunny afternoon last week , only two of eight planes that took_off kept to the middle of the golf_course . Three flew along its edge and three others missed it completely , flying over residential streets . Neighbors say that ' s not unusual . Pilots who stray are likely to find themselves over the Lincoln Place apartment of Frieda Marlin , who helped organize her neighbors against airport noise . Humans , she said , aren ' t the only ones disturbed by the planes . &quot; The birds don ' t sing anymore , not like they used to , because of the planes , &quot; she said . Another frequent complaint of residents is that pilots ignore another procedure that is supposed to be in_use -- to fly west until they reach Lincoln Boulevard . One of Marlin ' s neighbors , Gideon Dagan , said planes often turn early . &quot; It bothers me . Sometimes you ' re on the phone , &quot; he said as he stood on his front_porch , distracted by a plane flying overhead . &quot; You hear it yourself. &quot; Griff Hoerner admits he ' s one of the early-turning culprits . He said that when he ' s flying a Piper Cub , a relatively slow plane , he has to stay closer to the airport on takeoff . Otherwise , he would n ' t be able to glide back to the airfield if his engine dies . But he ' s trying to cooperate , he said . When one neighbor complained about his early turns , he called the resident to explain and even offered to give him a plane ride to demonstrate the problem . Brandsen , sitting in his office over the Spitfire Grill , said pilots and residents have shown they can work together , but he doesn ' t expect everyone to be happy . &quot; As long as there are planes and people living next to airplanes , it ' s never going_to go_away , &quot; he said . that ' s particularly true when the airplanes are crashing . In the most recent accident in April , cable_television director Patrick Dean Brinnon died while trying to accumulate enough flying hours to get a pilot ' s job . The engine of the Piper Saratoga he was piloting failed shortly after takeoff , and he crashed into a garage while trying to return to the airport . The crash was the third in five months involving planes taking_off or landing at the airport . Five people in the planes died , although no one on the ground was hurt . There ' s no evidence that airport procedures contributed to any of the crashes . The airport has averaged one crash per 200 # 000 takeoffs and landings -- about one a year -- a safety record considered better than average . Walsh , the airport director , said the explanation for increased airport noise of late is the increased number of flights in summer . Last summer , airport construction kept the number of flights down , but now on sunny days pilots are taking_to the skies enthusiastically . He doesn ' t have to tell that to Marlin . &quot; On a clear day , &quot; she said , &quot; you can hear forever. &quot;</TEXT>
