   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS SAY DISABLED GENE IS A CAUSE OF KIDNEY CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A disabled gene that seems to let cells grow uncontrollably , like a car losing its brakes , is responsible_for the most common form of kidney cancer , scientists reported Friday . Identification of the gene may lead to earlier detection of kidney cancer and possibly better treatment and prevention , said Dr. W . Marston Linehan of the National Cancer Institute , senior author of the study . The gene is one of a growing class of known &quot; tumor suppressor &quot; genes , which normally act to prevent cancer . When they are disabled , that control is lost . &quot; It ' s like a car losing its brakes , &quot; Linehan said Friday . The gene is linked to a form of kidney cancer that accounts_for more_than 19 # 000 cases every year in the United States , Linehan said . This form accounts_for about 85 % of kidney cancers . The institute said the gene is responsible_for the kidney cancer type . But David Smith of the Wayne State University School_of_Medicine , who studies the genetics of kidney cancer , said he did not consider that proven . &quot; I ' m sure that it plays a role , how big a role remains to be discerned , &quot; he said . Linehan said the work may lead to some form of test to identify disabled versions of the gene in cells in the blood or urine , which could greatly improve the prospects for early diagnosis of the kidney cancer . The work is reported in the May issue of the journal Nature Genetics .</TEXT>
