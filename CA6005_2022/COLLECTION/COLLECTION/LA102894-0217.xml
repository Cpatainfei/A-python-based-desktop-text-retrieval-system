   <HEADLINE> RACIALLY RESTRICTED SCHOLARSHIP IS REJECTED ; LAW : RULING BY FEDERAL APPEALS COURT SETS THE STAGE FOR A SUPREME COURT CONFRONTATION . CASE CHALLENGES UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that college scholarships that are restricted to students based on their race are unconstitutional . The broadly worded , unanimous opinion by the three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sets the stage for a Supreme Court confrontation on whether two-thirds of the nation ' s colleges can continue to set_aside at least some scholarships exclusively for minority students . &quot; Of all_the criteria by which men and women can be judged , the most pernicious is that of race , &quot; wrote Judge H . Emory Widener of Richmond , Va . &quot; The casual invocation of benign remedial aims &quot; is not enough to justify a state-funded scholarship that bars some students from applying solely because of their race , he said . The decision invalidates the University of Maryland ' s Banneker Program , which awards all-expenses-paid scholarships to promising black students . In a closely watched lawsuit , the state-funded program had been challenged by a Latino student who was deemed ineligible to apply , even though he had a 4.0 grade average in high_school and a score of 1 # 340 out of 1 # 600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test . Daniel Podberesky , now 22 and a first-year medical_student at the University of Maryland , is entitled to the $ 35 # 000 in scholarship aid he should have received as an undergraduate , the court said . &quot; This is a decisive victory , and it ' s an important statement , &quot; said Richard Samp , an attorney for the Washington Legal Foundation , a conservative group that supported the lawsuit . &quot; We ' re disappointed . that ' s all I can say now , &quot; said Evelyn Cannon , the state ' s chief of litigation . The U.S. Department_of_Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund had supported Maryland in the case . In 1990 , an obscure lawyer in the George_Bush Administration set_off a national controversy over &quot; race-targeted &quot; scholarships when he advised officials of the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Ariz. , that they could not earmark scholarship money exclusively for African American students . To do so violated federal civil_rights law , said Michael L . Williams , an Education_Department official who is black . However , faced with a barrage of criticism , the Bush White_House quickly rescinded Williams ' order and announced that it would study the_matter . In February of this year , the Clinton_Administration reversed the stand entirely and gave its approval to &quot; race-targeted financial assistance &quot; at the nation ' s colleges and universities . &quot; We want the doors to post-secondary education to remain open for minority students , &quot; said Education_Secretary Richard W . Riley . The controversy does not concern scholarship programs that give an edge to minority students , but rather those that take applications only from students who are , for example , black , Latino , Native_American or Asian . It was not clear if the ruling would affect other , specifically targeted scholarships , such_as those directed to women . Earlier this year , the General Accounting Office found that race-targeted scholarships make_up only a small portion of all scholarships -- 5 % in undergraduate schools , 3 % in graduate_schools and 10 % in professional schools . However , the study also found that at least two-thirds of the nation ' s higher-education institutions had at least one of these scholarship programs . University officials said they are especially important for attracting minority students to highly competitive fields_of_study , such_as a graduate chemistry program . In a landmark case in 1978 , the Supreme Court said universities may_not use racial quotas in admission but that they may use race as a &quot; plus factor &quot; in favor of minority applicants . But Clinton_Administration officials said &quot; race-targeted &quot; scholarships are legal if they are intended to &quot; remedy past discrimination , &quot; or if they are needed to &quot; achieve a diverse student body. &quot; The University of Maryland certainly has a history of racial discrimination . The late Justice Thurgood Marshall , though a native of Baltimore , could not apply for admission to the University of Maryland Law_School . As a lawyer , he later won a ruling striking down that discriminatory admissions policy . But the appeals court said Thursday that this discrimination is too far in the past to justify a current discriminatory policy that favors black students . It ordered that the university no longer &quot; require that the applicant ( for a Banneker scholarship ) be of the African American race. &quot;</TEXT>
