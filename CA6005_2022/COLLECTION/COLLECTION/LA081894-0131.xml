   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : TUSTIN ; COUNCIL ENDORSES SOS BALLOT MEASURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The city in which Proposition 187 was born has endorsed the controversial statewide initiative that targets illegal immigration . Known as Save Our State , the November ballot measure would bar illegal immigrants from attending public_schools and prevent them from receiving social_services or non-emergency public health_care . Polls show widespread voter support for Proposition 187 , which has been endorsed by the California Republican_Party . Opponents include Latino rights organizations , immigrant activists and a broad coalition of religious_leaders , health_care professionals and school officials . &quot; This is where the initiative began , almost one year ( ago ) today , &quot; Ron Prince told the City_Council on Monday . Prince , a Tustin accountant , co-authored the ballot measure and is co-chairing its statewide campaign . After hearing Prince ' s presentation , the council voted unanimously and without comment to support the ballot initiative . The action came two weeks after the council unanimously passed a resolution urging Congress to address as a top priority issue &quot; the escalating numbers of illegal immigrants crossing the border into California. &quot; The resolution , which is similar to one adopted by the League of California Cities , cites the &quot; severe negative fiscal and social impacts &quot; that illegal immigrants create for state and local_governments . The resolution also notes that the proximity of the Border_Patrol checkpoint , which it contends is &quot; inadequately equipped to detain illegal immigrants , &quot; has resulted in high-speed chases that endanger the lives of Orange County residents . In his presentation to the council , Prince said that &quot; we would like to determine who is here legally and who is not. &quot; He estimated that there will be 3 million illegal immigrants in the United States by the end of the decade . Of that number , about 40 % come from Mexico , he said , and the rest are from &quot; virtually every country in the world. &quot; Many of these people tend to be uneducated and unskilled , Prince contended . Prince seemed especially concerned about the estimated 400 # 000 undocumented children he said are attending U.S. public_schools . &quot; We are taking money away from our own children to give it to others , &quot; Prince said . Some critics have characterized Save Our State as an invitation to officially harass foreign-born people . The measure could result in undereducated children roaming the streets , prone to contagious_diseases and drawn to crime , critics contend . Opponents of Save Our State also point_out that illegal immigrants help support California ' s economy by providing low-wage labor and paying taxes . Even if Proposition 187 passes in November , the provision barring illegal immigrants from receiving public education might never be implemented . In a landmark case , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled_in 1982 that illegal immigrant children are entitled to attend public_schools . An analysis by the state ' s nonpartisan legislative analyst ' s office found that the initiative could put at risk as much as $ 15 billion in federal funds now provided to California for health , education and welfare programs .
