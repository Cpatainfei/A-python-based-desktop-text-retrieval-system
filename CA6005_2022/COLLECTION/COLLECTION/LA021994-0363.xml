   <TEXT> Summers in California , winters playing hockey in Rouen , France . . . . As French Olympic left wing Eric Lemarque says cheerfully , &quot; Life ' s a beach. &quot; Lemarque , the son of a French father and an American mother , grew_up in Southern California and began playing hockey in the now-defunct Topanga Hockey Assn . and in Culver City . Lemarque later went_to Detroit for two seasons , finished high_school a year early and attended Northern Michigan University on a full scholarship . He was drafted by the Boston Bruins after his first year -- he earned a degree in marketing and a place among the school ' s top 10 goal scorers -- but wasn ' t offered a contract and so went_to France . &quot; I have my French passport now because European citizens can play in other leagues in other countries , &quot; he said . Lemarque , 24 , returns to Manhattan Beach each summer , except for the six weeks he teaches at hockey schools . &quot; This is my third season in the_French European League and first on the national team , &quot; he said . &quot; This has just worked_out great. &quot; * U.S. defenseman Ted Crowley , who needed nearly a dozen stitches to repair a facial cut he suffered in Thursday ' s 3-3 tie with Canada , will wear a face_mask or half-shield tonight to protect his sore nose . Winger Brian Rolston , who had a swollen right foot , was able to walk normally Friday and is expected to take his regular shifts . HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
