   <HEADLINE> ANALYSIS ; COMMERCIALS DON ' T MEASURE UP TO HYPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe it ' s because they long for the ' 60s , or perhaps they just prefer folk and rock to rap_music , but an assortment of advertising executives Monday chose Pepsi ' s &quot; Woodstock Reunion &quot; spot as their favorite Super Bowl commercial . In reviewing more_than three dozen Super Bowl spots , six of the eight ad critics interviewed for this article chose the Woodstock spot , by ad_agency BBDO , as one of the best . The ad includes kids who look_on at the reminiscing adults and express hope that they won ' t skinny-dip again . Five of the critics , saying they may have been influenced by the recent cold_weather , chose two sensuous and understated spots for Norwegian Cruise Line by Goodby , Berlin &amp; Silverstein as among their favorites , although some questioned whether they were too soft-sell for the Super Bowl . &quot; I would consider taking the cruise , &quot; said critic Ted Littleford , executive creative director at FCB / Leber Katz . Overall , the critics expressed dismay that , just like the Super Bowl itself , it ' s become very difficult for the ads to live_up_to expectations for the highly showcased event . They cited a Frito-Lay potato_chips spot featuring former Vice_President Dan Quayle as falling_short_of the advance hype . &quot; It ' s just amazing to me how much money is blown on celebrities and extravagant productions , &quot; said Bill Oberlander , creative director at Kirshenbaum &amp; Bond . &quot; The program was_full of spots that tried so hard that they ended_up looking desperate , &quot; said Brian Sitts , senior_vice_president and group creative director at J . Walter Thompson . As an example , he cited the sixth annual Bud Bowl with once dazzling computer animation that &quot; has become ho-hum today. &quot; Several of the critics said a spot in which Cindy Crawford turns_into Rodney Dangerfield after being deprived of Pepsi was overproduced and predictable . They also gave mediocre marks to a Pepsi spot starring taste-testing chimps , even though the ad got a record high score in a USA Today poll . The execs split on two Nike ads starring Steve Martin that asked whether Michael Jordan had faked retirement . Some said the comedian was wasted ; others said the spot was very entertaining . They also split on a Doritos Tortilla Thins ad in which Chevy Chase is fired and on Chrysler spots introducing the Neon . Some critics said the use of a rapping and dunking Shaquille O ' Neal for Reebok did not work . &quot; The Reebok spot was pretty mind-numbing , &quot; said Julie Newton-Cucchi , creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather . The ad execs said that even if an ad works in normal programming , it may be wasted in an event that charges advertisers a whopping $ 900 # 000 per 30 seconds and that plays to a largely partying crowd . &quot; Those advertisers that don ' t do commercials that are significant enough to get pre- or post-PR out of it are really wasting money , &quot; said Ron Berger of Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer . As examples , the critics cited spots for Ray-O-Vac batteries that were heavy on graphics but short on entertainment , and a Goodyear spot with cars tugging water skiers . Some spots went_on too long , the critics said , citing a 90-second spot for Alamo rental cars , when a couple takes a 4-million-mile trip . &quot; It went_on so_long I ended_up feeling sorry_for the family , &quot; Sitts said . Other spots have overextended their themes , critics said . A McDonald ' s spot last year that pitted Jordan against Larry Bird in a whimsical basketball showdown was warmly received , but the sequel stretching to outer space and adding Charles Barkley was not as popular . &quot; The idea is tired , &quot; said Brent Bouchez , senior_vice_president at Ammirati &amp; Puris . Similarly , some critics said the use of basketball star Larry Johnson as &quot; Grandmama &quot; for Converse has grown tired , even with Wizard of Oz imagery . And 7-Up ads using animated spots to wipe_away the color of cola were not helped by the additions of humans in a casino , several critics said . Some ads were entertaining but seemed to have little to do with the product , said Jay Schulberg , vice_chairman at Bozell . A few critics cited a Lipton Iced Tea spot that was a spoof of Kung Fu with David Carradine and The Three Stooges as looking more like a cola commercial , while others said it was clever . In contrast , critics were impressed by a Reebok Insta-Pump spot with Emmitt Smith that looked almost like part of the game . Said Carmon Johnston , broadcast production director at Uniworld Group , &quot; The star of the show was the Reebok ad that used actual highlight footage to cut a commercial live. &quot;</TEXT>
