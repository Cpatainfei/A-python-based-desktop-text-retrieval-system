   <TEXT> The problems on the Russian national soccer team , which Coach Pavel Sadyrin called &quot; normal , &quot; threaten to disrupt the team ' s World Cup preparations . Sadyrin dismissed the problems Saturday night in Seattle , where the United States tied a depleted Russian squad , 1-1 . More_than half of the national team refused to make the trip . Two months ago , 14 players met in Athens and sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin ' s sports adviser demanding that Sadyrin be replaced by former national coach Anatoly Byshovets . The mutiny involves most of the team ' s best players , including eight from the powerful club team Spartak Moscow and several from the Italian , German and English leagues . Even without the support of the country ' s top players , the Russian federation is fully behind Sadyrin . The coach said most of the problems can be traced to club teams ' refusal to release players for matches before the World Cup . &quot; It is a normal process with the Russian national team , &quot; Sadyrin said after Saturday ' s game . &quot; Some people are not happy with something . Some don ' t like what he sees . But only the players who want to play will play_on this team . In soccer , there are always replacements. &quot; The dissident players say Sadyrin is incompetent . But the hidden agenda includes anger at the Russian federation over financial deals . Some players say they haven ' t received promised bonuses for qualifying for the World Cup . The main concern is about an official team deal -- brokered by Sadyrin -- with Reebok . Russian players are angry that the team deal conflicts with their own endorsement contracts . Shades of the U.S. team ' s deal with Adidas . Sadyrin was not in a kiss-and-make-up mood . But if the Russians hope to get_out of the first round in the World Cup ' s Group_B -- with Brazil , Cameroon and Sweden -- all parties will have to learn to live together , if only for a short while . * The report on Roy Wegerle ' s knee injury has gone from minor to serious , which might keep the England-based forward , who plays for the U.S. national team , sidelined for two months . U.S. soccer officials learned earlier this month that Wegerle suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament during a match against Coventry City on Jan . 8 . After hearing that , U.S. team trainer Rudy Rudawsky estimated Wegerle would miss only 10 days . However , a diagnostic arthroscopy revealed a 50 % tear of Wegerle ' s anterior cruciate ligament , which doctors repaired . The more serious nature of the injury has team officials worried , almost as much as the behavior of Coventry ' s medical team . Rudawsky has requested that Wegerle ' s medical_reports be faxed to him , but there has been no response . Normally , U.S. officials would ask a player to return to the United States for rehabilitation , but in this case there is concern that such a move might offend Wegerle ' s English doctors . U.S. General_Manager Bill Nuttall said Coventry City must approve any travel for Wegerle , and the club is unlikely to allow him to return to the United States for treatment . Nuttall said it is possible that U.S team doctors would go_to England to examine Wegerle ' s knee . Wegerle expects to be playing again in mid-March . * Major_League Soccer held a bidder ' s conference last week in Santa Monica , where groups from 29 cities were briefed about the process of franchise approval . Bidders were told that MLS would expect each group to sell a minimum of 10 # 000 season_tickets , and to have plans for the use of or construction of a stadium with a capacity of 20 # 000 to 30 # 000 . Bids are_due by May 15 , and the announcement of the 12 finalists is set for June . The league is expected to begin play in 1995 . General Secretary Hank Steinbrecher of the U.S. Soccer Federation said Saturday night that MLS , which has been sanctioned by his organization as a Division 1 professional soccer entity , is expected to have most of its financing in place by the end of April . The federation ' s advisory_board monitoring the progress of MLS start-up activities will meet again next week , Steinbrecher said . Soccer Notes Roger Milla of Cameroon , sentimental star of the 1990 World Cup , said he is considering a comeback with the team he currently directs . Milla , 42 , added : &quot; Everything depends_on my form. &quot; If Milla does participate , he would be the oldest player ever in a World Cup . . . . Indications are that AC Milan owner and media magnate Silvio Berlusconi is preparing a campaign to become prime_minister of Italy . Berlusconi has bought advertising time on television , and his slogan , interestingly , is identical to that of the Italian national soccer team . . . . Riot police fired tear_gas and charged about 200 fans who went_on a rampage outside the training camp of AS Roma last week . The fans were apparently angry after the team lost its sixth game of the season . . . . Terry Venables is expected to be named England ' s national coach . Venables would replace Graham Taylor , who resigned in November after his team failed to qualify for the World Cup . Concern about Venables ' still-unresolved business_dealing while running Tottenham Hotspur has reportedly prompted the_English Football Assn . to build an escape clause into Venables ' s two-year deal should the coach be implicated in any wrongdoing .</TEXT>
