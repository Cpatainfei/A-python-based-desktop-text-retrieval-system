   <HEADLINE> OPEC ' S FAILURE TO AGREE ON CUTS IN OUTPUT COULD PUSH PRICES LOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> International oil prices are poised to drop after OPEC ministers gave_in to Saudi demands that the current oil_production ceiling be extended until the end of the year . After two days of talks , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on Saturday failed to hammer_out an agreement to cut output , electing instead to hold the ceiling at 24.52 million barrels a day.OPEC produces 40 % of the world ' s supply . Since that quota was set_in September , oil prices have slumped about 20 % . A senior OPEC official warned that oil prices may slide further , to single digits , if member states don ' t strictly adhere to the limit . &quot; Everybody sees the danger if we don ' t follow the script , &quot; the senior official said . &quot; A single-digit price is not excluded. &quot; West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. crude benchmark , for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange , settled at $ 15.13 a barrel on Friday . Analysts were divided over the outlook for prices , although few were as skeptical as the OPEC official . &quot; It means OPEC is not prepared to defend the price of oil , &quot; said Mike Rothman , senior energy analyst for Merrill Lynch Commodity Research Unit . Arthur Tower , research manager with New Orleans-based Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. agreed . &quot; The ( U.S. ) market may trade off $ 1 or $ 2 . I can ' t see how you can say this agreement is good. &quot; Other analysts said prices will be steady since the decision was in_line with expectations .</TEXT>
