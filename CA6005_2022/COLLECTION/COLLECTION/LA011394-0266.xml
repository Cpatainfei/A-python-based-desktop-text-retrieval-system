   <HEADLINE> U.N. REPORT ON AIR STRIKES IN BOSNIA DUE ; BALKANS : BOUTROS-GHALI ORDERS THE STUDY . NATO HAS THREATENED TO USE AIR_POWER , BUT ISSUE REMAINS CONFUSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an atmosphere of doubt and ambiguity , U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday ordered a top aide to prepare a report in the next five days on the possible use of NATO air_power to break rebel Serb strangleholds in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Boutros-Ghali ' s decision on whether to authorize such air strikes -- and the procedure for ordering each one -- apparently will be made after the report is taken_up at a high-level U.N. meeting in Geneva on Monday . The secretary_general ordered Yasushi Akashi of Japan , his highest-ranking civilian official in the Balkans , to make the report after this week ' s NATO threat to use air_power to relieve Canadian peacekeepers in Srebrenica , open the Tuzla airport for humanitarian supplies and stop the bombardment of Sarajevo . The warning came at the end of a summit of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization in Brussels . The whole issue has been clouded , however , by widespread skepticism over NATO ' s resolve and confusion about how any order would be carried_out . Under a Security_Council resolution passed last June , the final authority for ordering air strikes appears to lie_with Boutros-Ghali . But there is a good_deal of ambiguity about the procedure . To complicate matters further , the secretary_general reportedly has been angered by the attitude and remarks of Gen . Jean Cot of France , commander of U.N. forces in the former Yugoslav federation . Cot has argued in interviews that the military command -- not a civilian such_as the secretary_general -- should make the final_decision on any air strikes . His comments , according to Reuters news_agency , prompted Boutros-Ghali , long wary of any use of air_power in Bosnia , to send Cot a letter of reprimand . In Geneva , U.N. spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said that Akashi , the secretary_general ' s special representative for the former Yugoslav federation , will present his report to Boutros-Ghali at a Monday meeting that will be attended as well by Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway , the co-chairman of the Bosnian peace conference , and by Marrack Goulding , the undersecretary general for political affairs . In its June resolution , the Security_Council said that NATO , &quot; under the authority of the Security_Council and subject_to close coordination with the secretary_general &quot; and the U.N. peacekeeping force , &quot; may take . . . all necessary measures , through the use of air_power &quot; to support the peacekeepers in their mission . On the basis of this resolution , Boutros-Ghali later told the council that &quot; the first decision to initiate the use of air resources in this context will be taken by the secretary_general in consultation with the members of the Security Council. &quot; It has never been clear whether Boutros-Ghali intended to simply inform the council of his decision or to seek its approval . This presumably will be cleared_up after the Monday meeting .</TEXT>
