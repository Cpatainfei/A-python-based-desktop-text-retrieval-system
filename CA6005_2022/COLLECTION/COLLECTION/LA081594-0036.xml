   <HEADLINE> ALLAN MALAMUD : NOTES ON A SCORECARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the fourth day of the strike , the Angels remain closer to first place than the Atlanta Braves . . . . What bugs me is the lack of urgency shown by both parties in the labor dispute . . . . Richard Ravitch and Donald Fehr have appeared together more often on television than at the negotiating table . . . . Right now , most of the owners and players are more concerned about punishing the other side than about reaching an agreement . . . . Will the broken hand suffered by Jeff Bagwell during the Houston Astros ' next-to-last game before the strike be known as a timely injury ? . . . . Dennis Gilbert called to say that New York Met pitcher Bret Saberhagen , not Dodger third_baseman Tim Wallach , should be the National League comeback player of the year . By the way , Gilbert is Saberhagen ' s agent . . . . * If you like slaughters , you must have loved switching between the PGA Championship and the World Championship basketball final Sunday . . . . Shaquille O ' Neal was one Dream Team II member who would have belonged on Dream Team I . . . . The competition in Canada was weak , but O ' Neal showed that he has improved his footwork and will be a more versatile offensive player next season . . . . TV analyst Doug Collins wondered if there will be a better starting five in the NBA this season than O ' Neal , Horace Grant , Dennis Scott , Anfernee Hardaway and Nick Anderson of the Orlando Magic . . . . The trash-talking Americans might not have won any Mr. Congeniality awards , but , as usual , Joe Dumars was a class act.The veteran Detroit Piston guard never embarrassed the opposition and asked Coach Don Nelson to cut his playing time so teammates could play more . . . . Riddick Bowe needs an eye exam if he didn ' t realize that Buster Mathis Jr . was_on one knee when he landed a right_hand on Mathis ' jaw Saturday night . . . . Too_bad George Foreman wasn ' t working the fight for HBO because he could have told viewers about the time he did virtually the same thing to Joe ( King ) Roman in the first round in Tokyo in 1973 . . . . That night , though , Foreman , making his first defense of the heavyweight title , was declared a knockout winner over Roman . . . . The &quot; no contest &quot; ruling in Atlantic_City was proper , but there is no need for a rematch . Mathis , though willing , is not exactly the complete package . It was only a matter of moments before Bowe would have finished him cleanly . . . . Bowe got sharper as the bout progressed , but looked_like a fighter coming_off a nine-month layoff . He should have a tuneup fight or two before challenging Lennox Lewis for the World Boxing Council title . . . . Funny , but Foreman would be a heavy favorite over Joe Hipp , who is expected to replace him as Michael Moorer ' s next opponent . . . . And if you don ' t think politics were involved in the cancellation of the Moorer- Foreman fight , how come the WBA waited until a month after the bout was signed to announce that it would n ' t sanction Foreman ? . . . Former bantamweight and super-bantamweight champion Lupe Pintor , 39 , should be saying &quot; no mas &quot; after being stopped by Leonardo Mas . . . . Eddie Delahoussaye again demonstrated that nobody is better on a stretch runner when he rode Tinners Way to victory over Best Pal in the $ 1-million Pacific Classic Saturday at Del Mar . . . . * USC quarterback Rob Johnson and tackle Tony Boselli were among Trojans who worked_on the Coliseum reconstruction crew this summer . . . . &quot; I only worked about a week and a half , sweeping up and picking_up trash and wood , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; Some of it was_on the graveyard_shift from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. I lost interest fast . I usually get bored when I ' m doing something besides sports. &quot; . . . The stadium , which was badly damaged by the earthquake , is supposed to be ready in time for the Trojans ' Sept . 3 opener against Washington and Johnson is delighted about that . . . . &quot; I love the Coliseum , &quot; he said . &quot; It gives us a huge home-field advantage . I think a lot of visiting teams are intimidated. &quot; . . . The Raiders showed midseason form Saturday in Pittsburgh when they were penalized 10 times . . . . So did the Rams when they put their quarterbacks ' lives in danger against the New England Patriots . . . . The addition of 1 # 000-yard running_back Leonard Russell won ' t help the Denver Broncos solve their biggest problem , which is defense . . . . Parity among Americans on the PGA Tour means mediocrity when none of them wins a Grand_Slam tournament in 1994 .</TEXT>
