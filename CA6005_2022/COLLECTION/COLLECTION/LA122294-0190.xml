   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; STEALING INTO OUR LIVES ; UNSENSATIONAL CRIMES OFTEN TAKE BIGGEST TOLL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The crimes from which we suffer are not typically the crimes that grab headlines . Rape , robbery and murder stories may fill newspapers and local TV news_shows , but annually they account_for less than 5 % of the nation ' s reported felony crimes . Our victimization is more mundane : a stolen bicycle , a battered wife , an old car taken from a parking_lot , a cherished watch swiped from our house . These commonplace crimes are categorized by the FBI as larceny thefts , aggravated assaults , auto thefts and burglaries . Although all_of those crimes inched downward last year and in the first six months of 1994 , according to recently released FBI statistics , they still take_up the biggest chunk of police time and involve huge financial_losses -- $ 15.2 billion in 1992 -- and untold emotional distress . Crime statistics from the 30 cities in the San Gabriel Valley reflect the same trend . Of the 88 # 656 serious felony crimes reported in 1993 to valley law_enforcement officials , 91 % of them , or 80 # 957 , involved thefts , assaults , auto thefts or burglaries . An examination of those four felonies in the San Gabriel Valley provides a clearer picture of the toll everyday crime exacts on our lives . BURGLARY The Pico family was asleep last Christmas_Eve when burglars broke_into their Glendora home on a quiet hillside cul-de-sac . The thieves took a garage door opener from an unlocked family car_parked outside , used it to enter the garage and walked inside through an unbolted door . When Pasadena attorney Tristan Pico awoke early Christmas_Day , he found sports equipment worth $ 1 # 800 missing . Worse , $ 4 # 600 in cash was gone , along with his wallet and his wife ' s purse . The couple rarely kept cash on_hand , but Pico had just been paid_for settling a court case . The family planned to use the small windfall to pay past-due bills ; business had been bad that year and their six children already knew they would receive no gifts . Now , on Christmas_Day , the burglars put the family in serious financial straits . * &quot; It was an awful experience , &quot; Tristan Pico , 48 , recalled . Creditors doubted their story , he said . The insurance_company would reimburse only $ 100 of the stolen cash . The family did not recover financially for six months , he said . The emotional toll was equally heavy . &quot; What was frightening about it was we didn ' t know who did_it , &quot; said Rosalie Pico , 47 . She suffered nightmares . Her teen-age daughter feared entering the home alone , even during the day . Six months later , one of the burglars , a neighborhood teen-ager , was caught , and $ 900 worth of the sports gear was recovered . He pleaded guilty and got probation . The Picos now lock their house at all times . Rosalie watches her back to make_sure no one follows her home from errands . &quot; We ' ve just become more paranoid , &quot; she said . Unwittingly , the Picos , with their 6 # 000-square-foot home amid million-dollar houses , fit the profile of those most at-risk for burglaries . Houses in low-income neighborhoods -- where most potential burglars live -- and those in high-income neighborhoods -- where costly jewelry and other valuables attract burglars -- are most often targeted , said criminologist Jim Garofalo . Secluded houses and those on cul-de-sacs are also more likely to be burglarized , according to the Insurance Information Institute , a national_insurance association . Nationwide , a burglary occurs every 11 seconds , and , according to 1992 national crime statistics , burglaries accounted_for and cost $ 3.8 billion in losses . In the San Gabriel Valley , nearly 22 % of all reported serious felony crimes last year were burglaries . Bedroom communities such_as Glendora , which are_quiet during the day , are particularly hard-hit , said Glendora Detective Gregory Santelices . * Burglars usually operate in pairs , most often during daylight hours and on weekdays when homeowners are at_work , police say . The cat_burglar or &quot; second-story man &quot; with specialized skills for cracking into securely locked houses is largely a fiction . A typical burglar is a drug_addict with simple prying tools : a screwdriver , crowbar or locking pliers , Santelices said . The recovery rate for stolen goods is poor , Santelices said . &quot; I tell ( burglary victims ) they ' ll get their stuff back , but most of the time , you don ' t , &quot; he said . &quot; Stolen stuff disappears real quick. &quot; To prevent burglaries , police and insurance_companies suggest that homeowners install deadbolt locks , outdoor motion sensor lights , an alarm_system hooked to a central monitoring station and timers on lights and a radio or television . Shrubbery should be trimmed to remove hiding_places for thieves . AUTO THEFT Hun ( Steve ) Kim , 23 , had planned to baby his shiny burgundy 1994 Honda Accord for the first 1 # 000 miles . But last Valentine ' s Day , as the former waiter returned home alone at night in his prized vehicle , he was followed to his family ' s home_in Bassett and confronted by three teen-agers , one holding a rifle . Ordered to lie_down on the concrete driveway , he gave_up the keys to his beloved car . The gunman threatened to kill him . Struggling to keep calm , Kim reasoned with the youth . &quot; Hey , man , it doesn ' t have to happen like that . I didn ' t provoke you , dude , &quot; he recalled saying . The three fled , leaving him unharmed . Four days later , detectives from a special county team specializing in auto thefts found the car in Baldwin Hills . Two 16-year-olds and a 15-year-old had used it to carjack six other cars before they were arrested and ultimately convicted . Even with his car back , Kim said , he remained upset for months . He fantasized about becoming a vigilante . He couldn ' t drive , stayed home from work and got_behind in his bills . He neglected his car , which had come_back filled with trash . &quot; It was disgusting , &quot; he said . &quot; I imagined them eating , joking and driving_around to carjack other people in my car. &quot; Over time and with help from his girlfriend , he calmed_down . But his life is changed . &quot; To this day , I ' m very paranoid , &quot; he said . &quot; I look behind me . I feel more guarded now. &quot; The team that found Kim ' s car is part of TRAP , the Taskforce for Regional Autotheft Prevention , a year-old program with its headquarters in El Monte . State funding began in 1990 after California legislators realized the magnitude of auto theft in California . Cars stolen in the state made_up 20 % of the 1.7 million cars worth $ 15.2 billion that were stolen nationwide in 1992 . Nearly half the California cars -- or 137 # 000 cars worth $ 1 billion -- were stolen within Los Angeles County alone in 1992 , said Sheriff ' s Lt . Stephen Curry of TRAP . The 50-person TRAP team uses detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , the California Highway Patrol , the Los Angeles Police_Department and other law_enforcement agencies . They ignore the &quot; mules , &quot; the hirelings who actually steal the cars , and instead concentrate_on the network of sophisticated criminals who devise intricate tricks to separate cars from their owners . One common subterfuge is to steal an expensive car , strip it of parts and return it to the streets for police to retrieve . The thieves buy back the frame when it is sold later at an auto salvage yard , after the vehicle identification_number on the frame has been recorded as &quot; salvaged &quot; instead of &quot; stolen. &quot; With the new legal designation , the thieves can replace the stolen parts , get insurance on the car themselves , arrange to have it stolen from them , falsely collect insurance on the missing car and repeat the cycle all_over again . One $ 96 # 000 Turbo Targa Porsche 911 was stolen , stripped and retrieved six times , with insurance_companies paying_out more_than $ 575 # 000 to the thieves , before TRAP detectives advised the sixth insurance_company to have the frame crushed , said Los Angeles Police Lt . Jim Murphy of TRAP . * Another scam involves credit fraud , in which thieves tap into a credit service such_as TRW , find someone with a good credit rating , make phony documents in their name and buy an expensive car , Murphy said . The thieves then drive a new car off the lot , never to make a payment . Said Curry of the scams they uncover : &quot; Protean is the word for it : It keeps_on changing , it ' s alive , it alters its shape , it changes its form and it ' s highly adaptive. &quot; For beat patrol officers such_as San Gabriel ' s Tony Baumgart , the perspective is different . Baumgart , who was honored this month for retrieving more_than 70 stolen cars , catches the mules , or car thieves . They are generally teen-agers equipped with a_few simple tools to break_into and start a car in seconds . The owner of a new Lexus or Mercedes-Benz often recognizes that the car is a target for thieves , but the owner of an older , less-expensive cars often does not realize the vehicle might also be targeted . In California , the three most frequently stolen cars last year were Oldsmobile Cutlasses and Toyota Celicas and Corollas , model years 1974 to 1983 , according to Western Insurance Information Service . In the San Gabriel Valley , Hondas of every model are targeted , Baumgart said . Although thieves cannot be stopped , they can be slowed_down , police and insurance_companies say . They suggest locking car_doors , using The Club or other anti-theft metal locks , parking inside garages at_home , parking in lighted areas when away from home and installing an alarm_system hooked to a personal pager . ASSAULT Maria ' s husband repeatedly banged her head against a bathroom mirror on their wedding_day . It was abuse so common that Maria now says she barely remembered it until a friend told her later about having seen it . Maria said that within two months after they met , her husband , charming and attentive at first , had moved her from her family ' s El Monte home into an apartment where he kept her isolated and jealously monitored her every move . He put a block on the phone so she couldn ' t call outside her area_code . He outlawed her studies at a community_college and at a dancing_school . He beat her if she glanced out the apartment window at a male neighbor ' s apartment or if she looked sideways on the freeway at a male motorist , she said . Planning their 1990 marriage had been a refuge of sorts . After a year of violence , Maria said , she was left alone if she busied herself with marriage plans . But once married , the abuse began again . Shame and embarrassment kept her silent and in denial , she said . During one fight at her parent ' s home , where Maria had sought some escape , her husband beat her 65-year-old grandmother . Maria finally recognized her plight . &quot; Until I saw him do_it to someone else , I didn ' t really know how bad it was , &quot; she recalled . It took a 45-day stay_at a women ' s shelter , a temporary restraining order that was repeatedly violated by her husband , divorce proceedings and assault charges against him -- eventually dismissed -- before Maria permanently freed herself from her husband . Now the articulate 26-year-old is raising two sons , ages 10 and 3 , as a single mother . A worker at a women ' s shelter , she helps other women , like herself , recognize abuse and take steps against it . She hasn ' t seen her ex-husband in more_than two years , but Maria adds , &quot; I ' m not entirely free_of the fear of him . I don ' t know what he ' s capable of doing. &quot; In the San Gabriel Valley , assaults made_up 13 % of serious felony crimes , or 11 # 559 , in 1993 . Police do not keep separate statistics on how many of the assaults involve domestic violence , but officials estimate that it accounts_for up_to half of the assault cases they log . Indeed , even as gang violence increases , patrol officers still spend much of their time answering calls between arguing couples . &quot; If anyone understands the horrors of domestic violence , it ' s the average foot_soldier police_officer , &quot; said Alana Bowman , chair of the county ' s Domestic Violence Council . &quot; They know women are not crying wolf on this. &quot; In Pasadena , officers in January will receive special training on domestic violence , said Sheila Halfon , executive_director of Haven House , a Pasadena shelter for abused women . Meanwhile , in West Covina , the county in October began a pilot_program with a separate domestic violence courtroom , in part because such assaults make_up a sixth of the courthouse ' s caseload . Municipal Judge Dan Thomas Oki , who presides over the domestic violence courtroom , handles all misdemeanor domestic violence cases and preliminary hearings on felonies before they are transferred to Superior_Court for trials . Plans are afoot to also have felony trials heard in his courtroom , Oki said . Despite new police procedures and the new courtroom , victim reluctance to testify in court or even report the violence to police remains an obstacle to helping women , Halfon said . &quot; If police do intervene , it just creates more problems , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s why so many of them won ' t follow through. &quot; For domestic violence victims needing shelter or counseling , there are three shelters in the San Gabriel Valley with 24-hour help lines : YWCA Wings in Covina , ( 818 ) 967-0658 ; the House of Ruth in Pomona , ( 909 ) 988-5559 , and the Haven House in Pasadena , ( 213 ) 681-2626 . THEFT On a Monday evening last April , a man strolled into J.C. Penney store on Pasadena ' s Green Street . Clerk Carol Beggy asked him if he needed help , but he said he was just looking . Minutes later , the man pulled_out wire_cutters , snipped the cable securing a $ 1 # 000 designer Raiders jacket to the rack , put the jacket on and walked casually out the door . Employees and store security spotted the thief outside as he left in a 1977 Chevy Malibu . Pasadena police traced the license_plate to the man ' s house in Pasadena , where officers recovered the jacket stashed behind a sofa and found the thief hiding in a bedroom closet . He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 28 months in state_prison . The FBI ' s statistics for larceny cover a broad category of crime , including shoplifting , theft of goods from inside a car , theft of vehicle parts , and employee theft of goods and cash from their workplaces . The annual toll for all such thefts came_to $ 3.8 billion in 1992 , according to national crime statistics . Scams are also logged by the FBI under the category of thefts . In the San Gabriel Valley , the FBI is investigating a phony operation that promised to provide consumer_loans in return for a processing fee , said Lisa Altmar , a special_agent in the West Covina FBI office . The loan group previously operated out of Orange County . But when enforcement toughened there , they moved to offices in West Covina , Alhambra , Glendora and South Pasadena . To combat theft , police_departments often provide store owners with free anti-theft sessions as part of crime prevention . Police also warn local residents against providing money up front when callers ask_for fees to process alleged sweepstakes winnings or to provide services or products , sight unseen . Overall , police provide a standard line of advice -- &quot; harden the target &quot; -- when they talk_about crime prevention . Criminologist Garofalo suggests that the advice may have worked . Statistics from 1973 to 1992 have shown little increase in overall crime , including thefts , assaults , auto theft and burglary . &quot; Trends have been pretty flat since the late 1970s , &quot; he said . &quot; One possibility is that there is better home security , more Neighborhood Watch associations , better locks , more security surveys by police and a trend toward community policing. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Valley Crime Although the number of murders in the San Gabriel Valley increased last year , all other types of crime decreased . 03 # 15 , 08 # 08 Type of crime 1992 1993 Murder 188 221 Rape 533 494 Robbery 6 # 766 6 # 006 Assault 12 # 955 11 # 559 Burglary 19 # 997 19 # 193 Theft 35 # 959 34 # 820 Auto theft 15 # 841 15 # 385 Arson 1 # 319 978 Total 93 # 558 88 # 656 % Change -5.2 % Source : Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation , California Department_of_Justice , Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department and police_departments in the San Gabriel Valley .
