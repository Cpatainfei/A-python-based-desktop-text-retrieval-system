   <HEADLINE> FBI SUBPOENAS KIM ' S RECORDS ; ETHICS : FORMER MANAGER SAYS MATERIAL ALLEGEDLY SHOWS THAT THE CONGRESSMAN IGNORED WARNINGS TO OBEY U.S. CAMPAIGN LAWS . KIM HAS BLAMED PROBLEMS ON STAFF_MEMBERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Rep . Jay Kim ( R-Diamond Bar ) launched his drive for reelection this month , the manager of his 1992 campaign said the FBI has subpoenaed campaign records allegedly showing that Kim ignored warnings from his staff to obey federal campaign laws . William Silva , who was interviewed Feb . 18 by the FBI and IRS for two hours , said he told agents that he discovered early in 1992 that some campaign expenses had been paid with funds from Kim ' s engineering corporation . He said he warned Kim of the problem in a written report and gave Kim an informational video explaining that federal law prohibits corporations from contributing to federal campaigns . Last week , the FBI subpoenaed hundreds of pages of campaign material , memoranda , promotional literature , videos , computer diskettes and reports from Silva , who is suing Kim for allegedly failing to pay him a $ 40 # 000 bonus . A federal probe of possible election , tax and labor law violations was launched in July after The Times reported that Kim used about $ 480 # 000 from JayKim Engineers Inc. to finance his federal campaign . Kim , the first Korean-born American to serve in Congress , did not return phone_calls Tuesday . But Kim , whose 41st Congressional District includes portions of Los Angeles , Orange and San Bernardino counties , earlier said his staff was to blame for any campaign irregularities . He said he discovered during the 1992 campaign that his corporation had paid a_few small campaign expenses , but that he always intended that the campaign would repay the money . So far , records show , the campaign has not repaid any money to the corporation . And the corporation , which Kim sold last year to relatives , has forgiven the debt . On Oct . 27 , Kim ' s son-in-law , David Kim , who now runs JayKim Engineers , directed company officials to write_off $ 485 # 075 that was identified in company records as Kim ' s 1992 campaign costs , records show . David Kim did not return phone_calls Tuesday . President Rodney Allen said the costs were written_off , not as campaign costs , but as &quot; normal business expenses. &quot; During Kim ' s 1992 congressional campaign , records and interviews show , JayKim Engineers provided Kim ' s campaign with free rent , staff and office supplies . With Kim signing the checks , records show , the company paid campaign bills ranging from airline tickets to telephone_service . The expenditures were not disclosed on campaign reports that Kim filed . Kim ' s former chief financial_officer , Fred Schultz , said he provided Kim with a monthly tally of campaign expenses paid by the corporation . In a slander suit against Kim , Schultz said the congressman told him not to bill the campaign . FBI_agents who interviewed Schultz last summer and seized documents from JayKim Engineers had no comment , and neither did Assistant U.S. Atty . Stephen Mansfield , who is in_charge of the investigation . Silva said Kim brushed_off warnings by him and other campaign staff_members about use of corporate funds . Silva said he was upset and called the Federal Elections_Commission hot_line to inquire about his personal liability . &quot; I saw this was bad business , &quot; he said . Silva said Kim assured him that he would handle the_matter . &quot; After that , I just bundled_up the invoices and gave them to him to pay , &quot; he said . One of the invoices , Silva said , was for rent owed to the corporation for office space under terms of a lease . Kim earlier said it did not occur to him that the campaign should pay rent for space , which totaled $ 17 # 000 . Last July , Kim hired a Washington election attorney and a prominent Republican accounting_firm to review his books and determine what , if any , money was owed by the campaign to the corporation . Kim initially said he would use his personal funds to pay their fees . He has reported spending $ 23 # 000 in campaign funds to pay the bills . The accounting_firm ' s report has not been released , but Kim has said it concluded that his corporation should not have paid the rent or other incidental campaign expenses of $ 30 # 000 to $ 35 # 000 . Kim has said that he was entitled to his full-time salary during the campaign because he worked an estimated 40 hours a week on corporate business . But Silva said he told FBI_agents that Kim did not work enough on corporate business to justify collecting his full salary . &quot; There is no way he was working_on the business in the months of April and May , Monday through Saturday , &quot; Silva said , adding that he kept a log of Kim ' s political appointments . Records show that Kim collected about $ 300 # 000 in salary , benefits and expenses during the campaign and after the election . Silva said he first met Kim at the dinner where Kim announced his candidacy to about 30 close supporters . Records show that the catering bill of $ 946 was paid with a check from Jaykim Engineers , signed by Kim , even though the invoice carried a notation that it was a campaign expense . Silva said he left Kim ' s campaign after the June primary victory , when Kim allegedly broke a promise to pay him a $ 40 # 000 bonus . He sued the congressman last June . His attorney , Barry Besser , said he has rejected an offer from Kim ' s attorney to settle the case for $ 7 # 000 . Kim is scheduled to be deposed in the case April 2 . Kim founded JayKim Engineers about 16 years ago . With the help of government loans and contracts , the company flourished , at one point employing as_many as 170 people in five offices . Several relatively unknown Republicans so far have notified the secretary_of_state of their intention to run against Kim for the congressional seat . Attorney James V . Lacy , who ran against Kim in the last election and lost to him by 1 # 200 votes_in the primary , is considering running again . And Assemblyman Paul V . Horcher ( R-Diamond Bar ) said he is considering entering the race .</TEXT>
