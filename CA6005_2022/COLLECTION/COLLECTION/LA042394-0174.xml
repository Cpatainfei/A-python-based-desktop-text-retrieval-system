   <HEADLINE> EXCERPTS : MRS . CLINTON LINKS PROBLEMS TO ' OUR INEXPERIENCE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here are excerpts of First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s news_conference Friday : Question : Do you know of any money that could have gone from Madison to the Whitewater project or any of your husband ' s political_campaigns ? Answer : Absolutely not . I do not . Q : Actually on the same theme , with your commodities profits , it is difficult . . . to look_at the amount of the investment and the size of the profit . I mean , is there any way you can explain how you -- A : . . . Back in 1978 in October , one of our best_friends , Jim Blair . . . talked to me about what he thought was a great investment opportunity . He is someone who has been an investor ever since he was a teen-ager , with usually very good results . . . . And when Jim said , &quot; I think there ' s going_to be a great opportunity to make money , &quot; and explained why and asked me what I thought we could afford to invest , I told him $ 1 # 000 . So I opened an account at his very strong recommendation and proceeded to trade over the next months until July . You know , not all my trades made money . Some of them lost money . I talked to Mr. Blair very frequently . In fact , Jim would call me on a regular basis and I would make a decision whether I would or would not trade , and then the trade would be placed . Often he placed it for me . And there was nothing wrong with that . He was_on the spot . . . . I stopped trading_in July of 1979 , and I did stop trading in large measure because I could not keep_up with it . It takes a lot of nerve to be in the commodities trading , and I had just found_out I was pregnant . And so when he called again I said , you know , I just don ' t want to do this anymore . . . . And I didn ' t , and I ' m glad I didn ' t because he and other friends of mine who were trading ended_up losing money . So it was a good investment offered by somebody who knew a lot , who could provide a lot of good advice , and I was lucky and made the decision to stop when I did . . . . Q : Do you wonder since then if maybe your broker might have , because of your position or your husband ' s , might have given you some kind of unfavorable -- or , you know , a favored advantage ? A : There ' s really no evidence of that . I didn ' t believe it at the time . As I said , I made and lost money in that commodities account . . . . And even Mr. Blair , who ended_up losing money , I think would find it very hard to argue that he got any favorable treatment . . . . Q : There was a second account with the Stephens Co . in which I think you invested $ 5 # 000 . And at first the White_House claimed you lost money on it , but later you put_out documents showing you actually made $ 6 # 000 on it and didn ' t close it until a_few months after Chelsea was born . A : . . . There were two accounts . The first account , the one that I was just talking_about , was the Refco account . . . . Now , I closed that account_for good in October of ' 79 and I took some of the money that I had made and put it into an account at Stephens . And at that point , I made that a discretionary account . My Refco account was a non-discretionary account , which meant that I had to approve and give the go-ahead for every trade . In the discretionary account at Stephens , my broker made most of the decisions , and I think did a good job for me . He diversified the money that I gave him and put it into money_market and stocks and bonds , and $ 5 # 000 into some commodities . . . . In February of 1980 , my daughter was born . . . . And I remember talking to my broker some time after that , and I said , &quot; You know , I just want to get_out of commodities altogether . I don ' t ever want to have to worry about it. &quot; So he got me out of the positions that I had been in so that by May I was no longer doing any kind of commodity trading in the Stephens account . Now , what happened , though , is that he took the money that I now know I made -- I really didn ' t think I ' d made any money in commodities -- and he bought some stock and he did some_other things for me . Now in the fall of 1980 , my husband lost his election , we moved , so by 1981 , when I gathered all my documents together to give to my accountant , I had a year-end statement from Stephens which did not report anything about commodities , I had a year-end statement from the Peavey Brokerage Co. , which reported a loss , and I had no year-end statement from either Clayton or the company called ACLI . So I think what happened is we bundled all_of the documents we had because I took all_of the reports that I had , gave them to the accountant , and I believed that in the absence of a year-end statement , the accountant and my husband and I missed the fact that we had actually made some money in the Aklee account . . . . Q : Do you know anything about Mr. Foster ' s death ? Do you know what he wanted to tell the President that he didn ' t get_to tell him ? A : You know , I don ' t know that he wanted to tell the President anything . that ' s the first I ' ve heard of that . My memory is that the President actually talked to Vince Monday night before he died . . . and when I talked with the President afterward , he was stunned because the conversation was a very normal kind of a conversation . . . . Q : . . . There ' s been a lot criticism of the papers in Mr. Foster ' s office , that some may have been removed . A : I know there ' s been a lot of concern and criticism about that . I cannot speak_to that in any detail , but I know the special counsel is looking_into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster ' s death and I assume he will issue a report about that which I hope will put all these matters_to rest once and for all . Q : The Whitewater development was set_up , as you say , as a 50-50 partnership between the Clintons and the McDougals , meaning that you were liable for 50 % of the losses or 50 % of the gains ; and yet , by your own accounting , you lost half or even maybe a third of what the McDougals lost . . . . Doesn ' t that discrepancy represent some sort of a gift or gratuity ? A : No . And let me say that , yes , the ownership of the corporation was 50-50 . The liability on the underlying debt was 100 % for each one of us . I mean , there was no gift in that . When my husband and I signed that mortgage and when we re-signed guarantees , we assumed the whole responsibility . I mean , if Jim had gone_into bankruptcy early on , if Susan had left , we would not have only 50 % of the obligation , we would have 100 % of the obligation . Q : But why was it that the McDougals lost so_much more money than you did ? I don ' t understand . A : I can ' t answer that . I mean , we gave whatever money we were requested to give by Jim McDougal . I mean , he was the one who would say , &quot; Here ' s what you owe on interest , here ' s what your contribution should be. &quot; We did whatever he asked us . . . . Q : . . . surprising that , given that you were jointly and severally liable for all_the debt and that you and your husband are both lawyers , that you would be so passive about a substantial investment . A : Well , but we were not real_estate developers , and Jim had a track record . And I wasn ' t a cattle expert ; I trusted Jim Blair and it worked_out for me . And I wasn ' t a real_estate expert and we lost money . Those things happen . . . . Q : . . . I ' m wondering what kind of a toll , if any , this has taken_on you and the President ' s personal and political lives , and do you ever look in the mirror and wish that you just never got_into this ? A : No . Never , never . I mean , some days are better than other days , but you know , I think what has helped me in the last couple of weeks , aside from some good friends who have talked with me and helped me get rezoned , if you will , is my belief that this is really a result of our inexperience in Washington . . . .</TEXT>
