   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEWS ; ' CRONOS ' ALIVE WITH CHARMS ETERNAL ; MEXICAN WRITER-DIRECTOR GUILLERMO DEL TORO TURNS A FAMILIAR HORROR STORY INSIDE OUT TO CREATE A FRESH AND HUMOROUS TALE STRAIGHT FROM THE CRYPT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bela Lugosi may have made_it look easy , but being one of the undead , &quot; Cronos &quot; insists , is hardly_a simple thing . It can be a lonely state , painful but also crazily comic in a charming if grotesque way . It ' s all on view in this pleasant and spooky film that gives surprising new life , so to speak , to a genre that won ' t die . The first feature by 29-year-old Mexican writer-director Guillermo del Toro , &quot; Cronos &quot; exemplifies the good things that can happen when adventurous filmmakers choose to investigate traditional forms . Winner of both the Critics Week competition at Cannes and nine Ariels , Mexico ' s Academy Awards , &quot; Cronos &quot; surprises with its sophisticated and spirited look_at a tale straight from the crypt . &quot; Cronos &quot; opens with a prologue , detailing the strange history of an alchemist who fled the Spanish Inquisition to Veracruz in 1536 in_order to continue working_on his plans for a machine that granted eternal_life , a machine he called the Cronos Device . Four hundred years later , the alchemist dies in a freak accident and though his mansion and its contents are sold , the portentous narrator informs , no mention was ever made of this device and &quot; as far as anyone knew , it never existed. &quot; Existing as well without any knowledge of all this is Jesus Gris ( Frederico Luppi ) , a gray-haired antiques dealer in today ' s Veracruz who lives perhaps too quietly with his wife ( Margarita Isabel ) and his mostly silent granddaughter Aurora ( Tamara Shanath ) . One day , his attention drawn to a figure of an archangel in his shop , Jesus discovers a wondrous mechanical gold egg inside , an impressively elaborate mechanism that makes a fine , creaky sound when it ' s wound_up and also does strange and insidious things to its owner once it is fully operational . Before he can figure_out quite how it works , Jesus and the device attract the attention of the sinister De la Guardias . Though concerned , in one of the film ' s many oddball touches , with a forthcoming nose_job , nephew Angel ( Ron Perlman ) is basically the muscle , following the orders of his obsessed uncle Dieter ( Claudio Brook ) . A Howard Hughes type , Dieter lives in a germ-free environment , listening to opera and dreaming of life_eternal . Forty years earlier , Dieter found the Cronos Device ' s instruction_manual and now he wants the item itself , which he warns Jesus , should never be used without proper guidance . But Jesus , already addicted to the machine ' s frightening , hypnotic actions , cannot turn_back . With this as the buildup , &quot; Cronos &quot; goes_on to tell the story of how Jesus deals both with the De la Guardias and the device , which , we gradually and deliciously come_to understand , is turning him into a vampire . It is a mark of what makes this old-fashioned story so clever that this realization does manage to sneak_up on us . Director Del Toro takes pleasure in turning the familiar horror story inside out , dispensing_with the evil vampire of legend and concentrating_on how an understandable desire for youth leads an average citizen into decidedly irregular paths . One of &quot; Cronos ' &quot; most characteristic features is its fondness for over-the-top Grand Guignol scenes that both graphically and comically illustrate the wear_and_tear of vampiredom , how bad it is for the complexion , for instance , how grueling and tiring it can be not to die even when circumstances make you wish for it . Though veteran Latin_American star Luppi gives a poignant and amusing performance as a man trapped by his obsession , the real centerpiece of this film is writer-director Del Toro , who ' s made a droll film out of what is often exploitation material . Edgar Allan Poe with a sense_of_humor , Del Toro not only has fun mixing genres , he knows how to convey his enjoyment and make the result distinctly his own . With any luck he ' ll have a creative life as long as any vampire ' s . * MPAA rating : Unrated .
