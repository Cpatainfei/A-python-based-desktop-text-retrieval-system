   <HEADLINE> POSTSCRIPT ; DIGGING INTO THE PAST ; RECANTED TESTIMONY ABOUT A CHILD ' S EXECUTION IN WWII UKRAINE CAUSES A FUROR AND REOPENS CONTROVERSY OVER SOVIET-ERA EVIDENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are no Jews left in Lisets . An abandoned cemetery of tumbling gravestones engraved in Hebrew is the only visible reminder of the 40 Jewish families that lived_in this western Ukrainian village before the Nazis deported them in the first phase of Adolf Hitler ' s Final Solution . Somewhere within the cemetery ' s chain-link fence lies the tiny grave of Monica Singer , the town doctor ' s 4-year-old daughter , who escaped the roundup only to be exposed as a Jew and executed outside the Nazi-run police_station . For years , the people of Lisets forgot about Monica . But a renewed quest to punish her accused killer is forcing some of them to re-examine the past , and the results are casting new light on one of the few areas of American-Soviet cooperation during the Cold_War : the hunt for Nazi war_criminals . Hanna Snigur remembers that autumn evening in 1943 , when she was driving the family cows home from pasture and saw a uniformed man carrying the Singer girl out of the police_station . &quot; The child was crying : ' Mama , he ' s going_to kill me and I want to live ! ' &quot; recalled Snigur , 64 , in her parlor hung with colorful embroideries and a poster of the Pope . Nearly four decades after the Soviets replaced the occupying Nazis , Snigur told her story to five Soviet officials and Kathleen Coleman , a lawyer from the U.S. Justice_Department ' s Nazi-hunting unit , the Office of Special Investigations . * In the videotaped interview , Snigur accused Bohdan Koziy , a Ukrainian American then running a hotel in Florida , of being the policeman who killed Monica . Although Snigur testified that she only heard the gunshots , three of her neighbors said they saw Koziy shoot Monica and also fingered him as the murderer of other Lisets Jews . Based on those videotaped depositions , in 1984 , a Florida court stripped Koziy of his U.S. citizenship for concealing his wartime past from immigration officials . Koziy maintained he was innocent . Facing deportation to the Soviet_Union to stand trial for war_crimes , Koziy fled to Costa Rica . He had been living there in relative obscurity from 1985 until June , when the World Jewish Congress launched a campaign to have Koziy , 84 , expelled . &quot; Costa Rica is disgraced before the world community for continuing to harbor this mass murderer , &quot; said Elan Steinberg , the congress ' s executive_director , by telephone from New York . Despite demands for Koziy ' s expulsion by U.S. lawmakers , including the sole Holocaust survivor in Congress , Rep . Tom Lantos ( D-Burlingame ) , Costa Rica has refused to oust him without an extradition request . The most logical country to request extradition would be the now-independent Ukraine , the scene of Koziy ' s alleged crimes . But when news of the campaign reached Lisets , Hanna Snigur decided that it was time to clear her conscience . &quot; I was a false_witness , &quot; she admitted , &quot; and I don ' t want to sin before God for making an innocent suffer. &quot; While Snigur did see someone carry Monica out of the police_station , she now maintains that it was not Koziy and that she never heard any gunshots . Snigur said it had never even occurred to her that Koziy was the killer until the KGB , which led Soviet war_crimes investigations , began questioning her about Koziy in the mid-1970s . &quot; I kept telling them I didn ' t see anything , &quot; she insisted . But when a Lisets policeman who was also a witness in the case threatened to send her &quot; to see the polar_bears in Siberia &quot; during a 1976 KGB interrogation in nearby Ivano-Frankivsk , Snigur said , &quot; I was afraid and I understood that I had to say that I saw Koziy carrying that child. &quot; She was also afraid when the Americans videotaped her . The KGB agents who interrogated her in 1976 warned her not to change her story and &quot; they were all there , in the room , &quot; she said . As the first witness in a Nazi war_criminal case to publicly charge that she was forced to lie under threats from Soviet authorities , Snigur has reopened the old controversy over the Office of Special Investigations ' use of what critics called &quot; Soviet evidence. &quot; In a rare show of Cold_War cooperation , the Soviets actively helped the OSI hunt for Nazi collaborators by providing lists of suspects in the United States , most of them emigres from East Bloc countries and what were then the Baltic and Ukrainian Soviet republics . The Soviets also provided copies of documents and witnesses -- such_as Snigur -- to prove the guilt of suspects . &quot; Snigur shows that Soviet evidence was unreliable and the OSI was either duped or deliberately defrauded the U.S. courts in_using it , &quot; charged New York lawyer Askold Lozynskyj , who was a member of Koziy ' s defense_team . But Steinberg , the World Jewish Congress executive , dismisses anything that Snigur says outside of a courtroom , contending that her change of heart has less to do with Soviet arm-twisting than with a new political climate in Ukraine . &quot; That region was a hotbed of Nazi collaboration , &quot; Steinberg said . &quot; During the Soviet era , this was something people wanted to hide . Now , many of the same collaborationist sentiments are coming_to the fore. &quot; Other skeptics point_out that because the three Lisets witnesses who testified with Snigur are dead , including the police_officer who allegedly threatened her , it is impossible to verify their earlier testimonies . But for Myron Wasylyk , a Ukrainian American on a council of advisers to the Ukrainian Parliament , Steinberg ' s equation of Ukrainians with collaborators simply proves the success of what he calls a KGB campaign of using the war_criminal cases &quot; to paint anti-Communist emigres as Nazis and anti-Semites in_order to undermine their political influence in the United States. &quot; Wasylyk ' s colleague on the council , Petro Matiaszek , recalls feeling that campaign ' s effects when he told fellow students at Seton Hall University in South Orange , N.J. , of his Ukrainian heritage , only to be asked if his father was a Nazi . &quot; It was supposedly a joke , but it reflected a widely accepted stereotype , &quot; Matiaszek said . Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksander Skipalsky , a former KGB colonel , confirmed that &quot; neutralizing &quot; anti-Communist emigre groups &quot; was definitely one of the KGB ' s goals &quot; in helping OSI . &quot; They were interested in finding war_criminals , &quot; he said . &quot; But only if they served that larger political purpose. &quot; For that reason , Skipalsky cautions against assuming that the Soviets were deliberately framing innocent people . &quot; You have to re-examine each case , &quot; he said . * Lozynskyj , the New York lawyer who worked_on the Koziy case , has long been convinced that the Soviets were pursuing a hidden political agenda under the guise of Nazi hunting and twisting the truth to achieve it . But he could never find proof . &quot; We had no access to anything in the U.S.S.R. , &quot; he complained in a telephone_interview . Soviet witnesses were not allowed to travel_to the United States , and depositions in the Soviet_Union were taken by Soviet prosecutors &quot; who interfered with defense_attorneys ' cross-examination , &quot; Lozynskyj said . &quot; It was a farce , &quot; he concluded . At a time when foreigners ' movements in the Soviet_Union were severely restricted , it was also impossible for defense_attorneys to hunt for their own evidence . In the case of John Demjanjuk , deported from the United States to Israel for alleged war_crimes , Lozynskyj noted , it was only under the easing policy of glasnost that Demjanjuk ' s lawyers were allowed to travel around what was then still the Ukrainian Soviet_Socialist_Republic to find evidence they claim showed that the brutal death camp guard &quot; Ivan the Terrible &quot; was someone else . Koziy ' s attorneys were not permitted to visit Lisets because the village lies_in the Ivano-Frankivsk region , home to the Mukachevo radar station and thus a closed military zones . * But now that the U.S.S.R. is no more and Ivano-Frankivsk is open_to the public , Snigur ' s recantation has fueled a local counter-campaign to clear Koziy ' s name . Mikhailo Boichuk , a deputy on the Ivano-Frankivsk regional council ' s human_rights commission who has been collecting evidence from Snigur and other Lisets residents , is sure that Koziy was framed by the KGB . He has asked the local Ukrainian security service , successor to the Soviet KGB , to drop the charges against Koziy . &quot; This way , Koziy can come_to Ukraine without fear if Costa Rica expels him , &quot; he explained . Whether Snigur ' s recantation would be enough to return Koziy ' s U.S. citizenship is unclear . Lozynskyj , Koziy ' s lawyer , did not indicate whether Koziy would seek to return to Florida . But now that the sole living witness against Koziy claims that he is innocent , political observers consider it unlikely that Ukraine will seek his extradition from Costa Rica .</TEXT>
