   <HEADLINE> GARDENING ; CULTIVATING FRIENDS : PLANT BUDDIES LOOK_OUT FOR EACH OTHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Companion planting allows the gardener to become a matchmaker with plants , turning strangers into fast friends . The practice of companion planting goes_back centuries , driven by the abiding belief that some plants do_better when grown near other species , either for protection from pests or as a result of a chemical interaction beneficial to at least one of the partners . The technique is unproven scientifically , although in its quaintness it may have merit , especially because each gardener ' s preferences provide gardens of diversity and character . In one plot , the aim might be to attract birds , in another , to repel raccoons . Companion planting in the modern garden is generally a casual undertaking , with few rules and an openness to new ideas and combinations . In fact , one of its basic truths is that where a combination might fail in one garden , it could prove indispensable in another . Most people , whether they are new_to gardening or have many seasons behind them , are familiar_with the marigold ' s reputation for warding_off all manner of insect pests above and below the ground . Although this reputation may be overblown , it goes_to the basic concept of companion planting : Plant marigolds among your vegetables , and you ' ll have fewer bugs . Marigolds , in field tests and in lab trials , seem to have a pretty good record in controlling damaging subterranean nematodes that invade plant roots . But in most cases , no one knows why something does_better when planted near something else . One gardener swears that planting radishes around her beans controls Mexican_bean_beetles . I have tried this and have seen little effect on the voracious bean pests . While the variables from one garden to the next will dictate much of how successfully companion planting works , there are some fundamental_principles that are universal and have been proved : * Don ' t plant tomatoes , eggplant and potatoes close_together . All members of the nightshade family , they tend to share pests . Thus , if the potato_beetle finds your eggplant near the potatoes , the pest probably will afflict the eggplant . Some gardeners find that eggplant is more vulnerable to beetles than are potatoes . * Don ' t plant parsley , carrots and cilantro near each other . These also share a family_tree and the pesky carrot fly . Its grub prefers to tunnel into the carrot but will go_to parsley and even cilantro if they are close_at_hand . * Do interplant onions , radishes and even -- yes -- marigolds with other garden varieties . Apart from the practical aspect of sneaking space-saving onions and radishes among larger plants -- they rarely compete with companion plants , and they do very well in the smallest of spots -- they emit an odor that is repugnant to a wide range of insect pests . Ordinarily , radishes and onions are pulled before they bloom . However , if they are left to mature , their flowers are most attractive to predatory insects that prey on pests . * Do combine dissimilar species . Eggplant with beans ; corn with potatoes ; lettuce and basil with tomatoes . * Do intermingle herbs with vegetables . With the exception of fennel , nearly all herbs offer aid to garden_plants by attracting predatory insects , repelling pests or simply providing a compatible growth habit . * Do interplant flowers with vegetables . These will attract birds and insects that prey on many pests . The classic example of this is nasturtium , with its peppery , edible foliage and its aromatic , edible flowers , themselves a magnet for hummingbirds . * Worth a try : Plant bush beans among tomatoes . I did this a_couple_of years ago and was delighted with the beans ' ability to keep_down weeds . In addition , they will fix nitrogen in the soil , providing an important nutrient to tomatoes . As a living mulch , low-growing bush beans ensure an even moisture content in the soil , important in the prevention of blossom-end rot in tomatoes . One caveat on this companionship , however : My bean crop was poor , I think because the tomato vines robbed the beans of their full measure of sunlight . * Worth a try : Combine corn with pumpkins , melons or other climbing squashes . The rough foliage of the squashes is reputed to dissuade raccoons from invading the corn at the time ears are ripening . The corn is thought to deter the squash_vine borer moth from laying its eggs_on pumpkin_vines . The squash shades the ground around the corn and even climbs_up stalks but does not hinder the corn ' s growth and development .</TEXT>
