   <HEADLINE> ELECTION ROUNDUP ; FAMILIAR FACES , SPIRITED CHALLENGES ; ELECTIONS : SOME INCUMBENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE RETURNED TO OFFICE , BUT NOT WITHOUT BEING GIVEN A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Voters across southeast Los Angeles County are expected to return several familiar faces to office next week , but challengers in some races are making spirited bids . Topping the list of close matchups is the 38th Congressional District contest between Rep . Steve Horn ( R-Long Beach ) and Democrat Peter Mathews , who hopes to buck what many political observers predict will be a banner year for GOP candidates . Registration figures in the district -- where 52 % of voters are Democrats and 36 % Republicans -- appear to favor Mathews . But the figures themselves do not tell the whole story . Political observers say that conservative Democrats in the district do not hesitate to cross party_lines . Horn , who has won support for his moderate brand of politics , may have the advantage because of his appeal_to such voters . In two other closely watched races , state Sen . Ralph C . Dills ( D-El Segundo ) and Assemblywoman Betty Karnette ( D-Long Beach ) are facing stiff challenges by well-organized Republican candidates . In the 28th Senate District race , Republican David Barrett Cohen , an attorney from Redondo Beach , has tried to paint Dills as an entrenched politician tied closely to special_interests . Dills , 84 , who has served longer than any lawmaker in California history , has focused_on Cohen ' s missteps , including erroneous allegations that Dills collected a legislative pension while in the Senate . Karnette is facing Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall , the Republican candidate in the 54th Assembly District , in which Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans .
