   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; CINEMA ZONE IDEA DRAWS CITY ' S INTEREST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Glendale City_Council asked_for more information from city staff this week about a proposed cinema zone that would allow movie_theaters to be located only along the Brand Boulevard corridor . City_Manager David Ramsay said the council will receive a report at its July 19 meeting on a proposed moratorium on cinemas and the results of a survey of cinema owners conducted to gauge their interest in the zone . Ramsay said the city is interested in designating a cinema zone to revitalize the city ' s downtown area . &quot; Often cities have found theaters to be a catalyst to facilitate a lot of good things happening , &quot; Ramsay said . The cinema zone concept emerged from discussions between the Redevelopment Agency and city consultants about how to create a &quot; 24-hour downtown &quot; in Glendale , said Jeanne Armstrong , director of redevelopment . In a move to draw more people into the downtown area , the city ' s economic adviser , Keyser Marston Associates Inc. , recommended that officials modify zoning requirements to allow movie complexes only along Brand Boulevard . Although Glendale currently has two theater complexes and a total of 12 screens , they are not close_together , eliminating the &quot; critical mass &quot; needed to draw patrons to the area , Keyser Marston representative Dick Botti wrote in a letter to the agency . Multi-screen cinemas can help revitalize sagging retail centers , Botti said , citing Santa Monica ' s Third Street Promenade and Pasadena ' s Old Town , two thriving areas that were &quot; virtually devoid_of any retail activity &quot; until theaters opened . Patronage at restaurants in Burbank jumped 25 % after an AMC theater was expanded from 10 to 14 screens , according to Keyser Marston figures . Although council_members approve of the cinema zone concept , they questioned the Krikorian cinema proposed for the third floor of the former Robinson ' s department_store . The theater would be_on Wilson Avenue , about three blocks from Brand Boulevard . Ramsay said his report to the council will include an update on the Krikorian proposal . JENNIFER OLDHAM</TEXT>
