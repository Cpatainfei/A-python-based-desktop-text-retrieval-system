   <HEADLINE> MICHAEL MORIARTY ON TV VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Michael Moriarty presented a dramatic , if not logical , argument against censorship of television violence ( interview , Opinion , March 6 ) . In the same edition , Cal State researchers reported that &quot; children who watch ' Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ' can be dangerous to other children ' s health. &quot; He presents an emotionally charged argument defending television violence . He says those in the government who want to censor violence have &quot; sick attitudes &quot; and are &quot; liberal fascists. &quot; Moriarty asks if we want a government that treats the nation as if we were children . No , but I appreciate the government looking_to protect children from an excess of violence being modeled for them on TV . Children lack the skills to mediate the violence they see on TV against the real_world . Young people being killed by guns is_on the rise in this country . This increase in aggressive behavior is not happening by accident . Moriarty needs to stop acting and start thinking . WILLIAM MALE Encinitas * The interview with Moriarty should be required reading for finger-pointing , whining religious groups attacking TV_programs , framed and sent to all transient politicians in Washington and reprinted in enough quantity to wallpaper Atty . Gen . Janet Reno ' s home . I am angered and disgusted that we have become a country allowing this or that bleeding-heart group to continue to blame &quot; outside forces &quot; for all_the social problems that suffocate our nation currently . One wonders if Reno and her gang offended anyone with their deadly assault in Waco , wherein dozens of people were slaughtered ? And , that production was without any special_effects . Unlike an action show of violence seen sometimes on TV , the attacked did not walk away -- and never will . The tsunami of censorship mentality prevailing now in America -- if carried to its fullest potential -- could ( and can ) do_away_with just about everything . Along with banning smoking , firearms , ethnic_jokes , helmet-free bicycle or motorcycle riding , fluid-less outdoor barbecue cooking , firecrackers on the 4th of July , curfew-free beaches at night and all_the other insanities of lost freedoms shoved in our faces , it is time to stop the madness . MAX ST . YVES Newport Beach * So Moriarty has had enough of being a liberal ! One issue and he throws_in_the_towel . What conviction ! Where was the righteous Moriarty when the visual arts were taking a pasting by members of Congress who wanted to censor the artists ' right to freedom of expression ? Or is it a case of whose ox is gored ? Of course we have always had violence in drama . But the Greeks and Shakespeare did_it with more class than &quot; Law and Order. &quot; Moriarty is a superb actor . He should get_off his personal soapbox defending violence on television and worrying about censorship of said violence and stay_on the stage and screen where his talents are fully appreciated . Please , Mr. Moriarty , don ' t make Janet Reno a personal vendetta . SHIRLEY PORTER Sunland</TEXT>
