   <HEADLINE> A SUITABLE MOM ; A PRINCESS COSTUME , A CLEAN CLOSET AND A MONTH OF EPIPHANIES LATER , A WORKING MOTHER REFLECTS ON THE MIXED JOYS OF STAYING HOME FULL TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I didn ' t work today . This might be no big deal for the 33 % of American moms who stay home full time , but I went_to work_at 16 , filing repair invoices at a Chevy dealership , and I haven ' t stopped since . I am confirmed workaholic -- by temperament , surely , but also by economic imperative , since I , like so many women , just didn ' t think to marry a pre-Clinton private-practice physician . Besides , I was one of those idealistic young_women who , 20 years ago , bought everything the women ' s movement was selling . A career meant independence and identity . I was not going_to be like my stay-at-home mom , who looked_at her suddenly empty house one day and wondered what to do with the rest of her life . All my friends had careers and then kids . We interviewed child-care people ( my favorite was the 17-year-old boy who thought that tending babies was a good career move after a summer at McDonald ' s ) . We swapped nursing-mother horror stories , most of which centered_on being trapped in a meeting at mealtime . We cut our hair short because we didn ' t have time to blow-dry the longer styles . We discovered that even the most enlightened male shows_up at the dinner_table at the appointed time assuming that someone will feed him . Our free_time evaporated -- and we pretended it didn ' t matter because there was nothing we could do about it . Everything got done somehow . We were no longer second-class citizens ; if anything , given how much we did , we were better than equal . That shoulder pain wasn ' t from the Snugli straps -- it was from reaching up and over to pat ourselves on the back . Convinced I was a member of an elite , if beleaguered , sect , I confidently signed 18-month-old Sarah up for what the preschool called a Mommy and Me class . It was supposed to be an opportunity for children to get used to school in two-hour sessions with their folks ; as it turned_out , I was the one who had trouble getting acclimated . Suddenly I was surrounded by women I hadn ' t known existed : my chronological peers , women in their 30s and 40s , who didn ' t work and didn ' t want to . Excuse me . They didn ' t work outside the home for compensation . They were full-time mothers . But most of them had child_care anyhow . They went_to the gym . They seemed to have read recent books from beginning to end , and they cooked meals that took more_than 20 minutes . Some of them had manicures , and all_of them were less harried than my indentured pals and I . Worst of all , they seemed happy . They weren ' t drooling for the chance to have a career . They were as smug as I was . In fact , some of them felt rather sorry_for me , trapped as I was by fiscal circumstance . I wanted either to kill them or be adopted by them . We circled each other warily . Moms with careers need to think that full-time moms are self-absorbed and limited ( no , no , they reply , we ' re focused and devoted ) . They , in turn , want to find us distracted and uncaring ( no , no , we insist , we ' re swimming in the economic mainstream and / or providing our children with a new , less lopsided gender model ) . We are too civilized to say so straight out , but everyone ' s self-esteem rides_on being right : Getting_up happy in the morning depends_on believing you ' re living a good life . Each side has its credentialed advocates , but nobody really knows how the other half_lives . So I decided to find_out , however briefly : I stopped working for a month to see what life was like on the other side ( OK , OK , in the interest of full disclosure , I did two book_reviews , got paid_for this piece and did not hang_up when my agent called ) . I took a dilettante ' s tour of what I secretly imagined was heaven on Earth -- and prayed would turn_out to be a dull purgatory , since winning the lottery stands between me and a lifestyle choice . I explained to Sarah , now 4 , exactly what I was doing . I was working_on not working ; this was not a permanent change . Going_into this , I imagined such bliss . Let ' s be honest here ( and I speak as someone who would just as soon read &quot; Babar &quot; to my daughter as watch a C-SPAN hearing ) : There ' s down time built into this child-rearing business . Our daughter ' s first six months of life revolved_around a lot of sleeping , with nursing breaks_in between ; she didn ' t know that I raced back home four times a day from my book research to be there when she woke_up . I admit her second year was a bit harder . I have an office at_home , and she quickly learned how to pick_up the knife and plunge it directly into my heart . A favorite early sentence : &quot; Mommy , you don ' t have to finish that chapter now . Your job is to play with me. &quot; But 3 and 4 filled_up faster than I was ready for , with preschool every morning and various superkid activities in the afternoon . If I didn ' t work while she was otherwise engaged , I could be a regular Renaissance woman -- well-read , well-toned , my garden a bevy of organic vegetables rather than the site of an ongoing turf war between wimpy lettuce and bruiser weeds . And I would n ' t be distracted when she was around . I ' d be serene . So why did I start my sabbatical in the clothes_closet , surrounded by piles of incipient hand-me-downs ? For the first time since I became a mom , I had time to enforce the two-year rule : Anything that hasn ' t been worn in two years goes_away . The same applied to the kitchen pantry . It was time to throw_out the impulse-buy Asian fish sauces and the toasted buckwheat . And Sarah ' s complete photographic history awaited me -- two shelves ' worth of unsorted snapshots , the profit from which has surely paid the private-school tuition for the lab owner ' s firstborn . Truly , a woman ' s work is never done -- not by herself , if she has an outside job , nor , it seems , by her husband , who carries the what- a- day- at- the- office- I ' m- too- bushed- to- do- anything chromosome . My own house reproached me . I was confronted by the true , silent casualty of working motherhood -- not my daughter so_much as her physical environment . No wonder Sarah ' s idea of cleanup time is simply to stack her stuff next to her father ' s pile of newspapers or my magazine Tower of Pisa . While the apple of my newly focused eye spent her mornings with her school buddies , I spent mine on drudge work . It hardly seemed the glorious existence I imagined the stay-home mom to have , but maybe the payoff would come later , when my kid came_home and I was ready to engage in a play activity that would exploit her formidable fine-motor skills and guarantee her eventual success as a brain_surgeon . Except when she appeared one day , I was inserting little moth-repellent sachets into sweater bags -- an activity Sarah and her fine motor skills found fascinating , much to my horror . I have women friends who never learned to type , lest they be consigned to the typing pool ; I harbor the same distrust of certain domestic skills . If you understand arcane rituals like the cleaning of tile grout with a toothbrush , you are doomed to repeat them . I liked it better when she followed me into my office , turned_on the ancient electric_typewriter and poked_out Happy Birthday Karen Love Sarah . My fondest childhood memory is of hanging_around deserted restaurants on Saturday afternoons while my father sold dishes and pots and pans to their owners . In my early days I drank many_a solitary Shirley Temple in dark , wood-paneled bars ; I consumed fortune_cookies while my dad flogged stockpots . Other girls imagined princes in castles . I had real-life adventures among men in tuxedos and women who wielded eyeliner with precise daring . So I like the idea of sharing my workplace , such_as it is , with Sarah -- and I like to think that she likes it , too . As to my essential role as the nurturing centerpiece of my child ' s universe : On my first Friday I hosted a &quot; play date , &quot; a scheduled interaction that , in this era of justifiable paranoia , commuter students and too_much to do , has replaced just hanging_out with the kids on your block after school . I usually send Sarah to the homes of non-working moms , but this month I was determined to reciprocate . I proudly drove both girls home from school , served_up a snack and waited to see what they might like to have me help them do . They ran upstairs , and Sarah ' s friend tried to close the child safety gate that we haven ' t gotten_around_to removing . &quot; Don ' t , &quot; said Sarah . &quot; We don ' t use that anymore . It ' s for babies. &quot; &quot; But if we close it , your mom won ' t be able to get upstairs. &quot; I waited for Sarah to tell her friend how glad she was that I was home and how she wanted me to be with her every minute . &quot; We can close my door instead , &quot; said the light of my life , with what I thought was inappropriate glee . The next sound I heard was a loud slam . By the time they emerged , I had read two sections of the newspaper . If she wants to discuss conditions in Sarajevo before bedtime , I ' m ready . Heartbroken and feeling not a little displaced , but ready . The second week was better . I came_home from car-pooling and paged through the paper . I renewed my acquaintance with our NordicTrack machine . I had conversations with my husband that were more_than two sentences long and did not begin , &quot; I ' m going_to_bed , but . . . . &quot; I dragged_out a_couple_of recipes for the simple reason that I like to cook them . The truth is , most working mothers make time for their kids by eliminating any time for themselves . Full-time moms -- or so it seemed to me -- at least have a little time to breathe . Once I got_into the swing of not working , new vistas opened_up . In the past , I would pick Sarah up at school and bring her right home so I could go_back to work . Now we could go anywhere , and we did . As odd as it felt , we went_to the park in the middle of a weekday afternoon . We lolled at the frozen-yogurt store while I waited for an officer from the responsibility police to come arrest me . We cruised the aisles at the arts-and-crafts store looking_for things to make collages with -- and then I sat and watched while Sarah turned our kitchen_table and floor into glitter beach , punctuated by rolling waves of glue . I spent a blissful couple of days making her a dress-up costume , for no particular reason other_than I had the time . My husband came_home one day to find me sprawled on the floor , surrounded by yards of pink satin and floral lace , sequined braid and the tissue pattern pieces for a generic princess / bride outfit . He froze . This was not his wife , who objected to pastels on moral grounds and took even the slightest alteration to her long-time tailor . This was the woman who represented a sizable chunk of the household ' s annual income . Finally , Larry found his voice . &quot; Is this something you ' ve known how to do the whole time we ' ve been together ? &quot; he asked . Once convinced that my condition was temporary , he was amused . My friends were not quite so charitable . It ' s amazing , the hostility a little initiative can elicit . My working buddies allowed as how they would never have time to make a costume , even if they did know how to sew , which of course they didn ' t ; it was such a retrograde pursuit , after all . Women who didn ' t work acted_as though I had poached on their turf . I had a career . It wasn ' t fair for me to know how to sew . All I had done was dust off a vestigial skill to make my daughter happy . But I felt_like a traitor . Just for a moment , I had blurred the boundaries between working women and home-moms -- and taken all_the fun out of the competition . A true adversarial relationship requires a foe who ' s clearly not like you . Otherwise , you have to wonder , why all_the animosity in the first place ? At least Sarah was pleased . Ecstatic , actually ; she wore the costume every time we had company . She put it on when she got home from school . She implored me to make a matching veil , and I did . She told everyone who asked , and several people who didn ' t , that her mother ( it sounded like she spelled it in all-capital letters ) had made_it for her . Heady stuff , to be the object of such unedited affection . Still , some little part of my brain protests : Play with her , it says , but do something else , too . I ' m beginning to think that the categories are wrong . It ' s not working mothers versus stay-at-homes . It ' s a matter of how you define the world -- whether you need a public life or not . I know one ex-worker who stays home now with two boys and is busier than ever , fund-raising , working for political candidates ; she needs to be , whether she gets paid_for it or not . Halfway through my month , God snickered , and for a daunting week I was completely on my own . My husband left town . Our child-care person , as if on cue , got sick . My sinuses flooded , but there was nobody around to feed me tea or tuck me into bed . When Larry gets sick , like most men , he assumes a woeful countenance and a prone position . But that kind of behavior presupposes the presence of a nurturing soul to look_after him . Sick moms usually stay_on their feet , particularly if there ' s no one above the age of consent to help them out . I was_on call , dawn to dusk . Sarah is a reasonable child : Once we negotiated the number of times I would read &quot; Nutcracker Noel &quot; in any given 24-hour period , we were fine . But I kept thinking_about what life would be like , hardest case , if both of us were_sick and I had to be at the office , and there was no dad or child-care person coming_back soon . Maybe it was an auditory hallucination , some side_effect of the cold pills , but David Byrne ' s lyrics kept pumping through my soggy brain : &quot; This ain ' t no party , this ain ' t no disco , this ain ' t no foolin ' around. &quot; The stripped-down , strapped mom -- the one who lacks the resources to hire in-house child_care or stay_at home herself -- faces a world that is pretty unfriendly to the institution of motherhood it pretends to revere . The rest of us , the luckier ones , get distracted by all_the infighting over what we ought to do , which in turn supports legions of social pundits looking_for a topic to take a position on . But hey : Want a good mom ? How about some decent corporate child_care ? How about participatory dads ? How about paycheck equity , so that a woman ' s work is worth as much as a man ' s , and she doesn ' t have to stay home by default just because she earns less ? I came_of_age in the era of conspiracy theorists : How about the notion that as long as middle-class women of clout keep snapping_at each other , they ' ll be too busy to notice that momhood in_general needs a societal helping hand ? So now , on top of everything else -- including my pending return to gainful employment -- I have to think_about being a more charitable human being . I have to stop envying the top tax_brackets and be more aware of what moms in_general need . It ' s a full life . Toward the end of my self-imposed exile , I attended a baby shower for my daughter ' s departing preschool teacher . We ate , swapped stories and watched her open presents . Then one mother presented her with a truly priceless gift -- a poster full of photographs of the kids in her class . She barely got her hands on it before the moms started passing it around , searching out our own children and our kids ' best pals . In the thin , wistful light of that autumn afternoon , our fingers lingered on those little faces , and then a strange thing happened . One woman called across the room to another , to tell her how lovely her daughter looked . Another commented on a happy , rascally picture of two boys . The generosity of the day demanded that one mom acknowledge another ' s delight . We had come_to know each other ' s children so well that we could judge the appropriateness of an expression : Sarah , caught in some serene reverie , looked just like Sarah , and I was not the only one who knew it . We are circumstantial friends , of course , brought_together not by anything lasting , but by the single coincidence of our children ' s age . Next year , when many of them head_off to kindergarten , only some of us will remain in touch . But we have handed our children over to the outside world together , if only for three hours a day , and that makes a bond -- one that for the moment blots_out the differences among us . Only a handful of us work ( we ' re the ones quietly checking our wristwatches ) . Would any of the other women in this room , right this second , really be willing to say that we are bad parents ? I don ' t think so . I don ' t know that the full-time moms are falling_short , either . I can ' t be so condescending -- or so defensive -- anymore ; I can envy them and do a good five-minute rant on how life is unfair , but that has nothing to do with them . You might have thought that was going_to be the soft-focus end of this little experiment . Not a chance . I am about to leave my kid again , so I ' m looking_for a bad_guy to blame . If all moms are potential allies -- or if the dreadful ones are driven by individual character flaws , rather than their membership in a particular caste -- then where did we get the idea that we were at war ? From Sarah ' s bookshelf . From the great childhood legends of our time -- or rather , the ones that the good people over at Disney have chosen to immortalize . We tried a Disney book embargo at one point , since they read like bad studio synopses and are riddled with redundancies and not a_few typos , but gift-givers did us in . We are surrounded by tellings and retellings of a handful of fairy tales -- and who are the villains ? Women ( more often than not , moms and stepmoms ) . There ' s the wicked queen in &quot; Snow White , &quot; the nasty stepmother and stepsisters in &quot; Cinderella , &quot; an octopodous Mama Cass look-alike in &quot; The Little Mermaid , &quot; and the evil Malificent in &quot; Sleeping_Beauty , &quot; a far more interesting lady than the heroine ' s mom , who is such a cipher that the storytellers don ' t even bother to give her a proper_name . Wonderful moms tend to die young and leave their daughters vulnerable : Belle in &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; must have inherited a whopping genetic legacy from her late mom , which spared her from resembling her Pillsbury Doughpop , Maurice , but we never get_to meet the lovely matriarch or even find_out what happened to her . Where are the dads , meanwhile ? Out , it seems -- or at least out_to lunch . Snow White ' s father was too dense to realize he was marrying evil incarnate and no match for it once he had ; Cinderella ' s pop made a similarly awkward choice and then dropped_dead ; Sleeping_Beauty ' s dad , Stephen , is an ineffectual dolt ; Ariel ' s father is in great shape for a guy his age , for all_the good it does him . They are all too busy ruling their respective kingdoms -- or , in Maurice ' s case , trying to invent one . In every story , the blame rests squarely on the distaff side : If mom had been less concerned with herself and more involved_with her dear daughter , that sweet young thing would not have slept_in the ashes / nearly had her heart cut_out by the huntsman / pricked her finger on a spinning_wheel ( any mom worth her salt knows that you borrow extra plates rather than snub a single fairy ) / faced a long life listening to a candelabrum do a Maurice Chevalier imitation . So our daughters go_to the movies and find_out that Prince Charming is going_to rescue them , and they ' ll live happily ever after , a lesson that guarantees job security in the fields of psychiatry and talk-show hosting for the next 30 years . And they learn that it ' s mom ' s fault they got_into trouble in the first place . Mothers , in turn , get the not-so-subliminal message that they should and could be doing a better job . My husband , who also works_at home , is held_in high esteem by a lot of people who admire him for spending so_much time with his daughter . But we both agree that I spend more time with her ( which is why he can tell you what was in the newspaper this morning and I can ' t ) . And all I get is people speculating about whether I ought to spend more . How ' s that for a double_standard ? I no longer think that happiness is a function of working or not . Nor do I think there will be a winner in the who ' s-the-best-mom sweepstakes . As the computer said in the movie &quot; WarGames , &quot; after a frustrating game of thermonuclear tic-tac-toe , &quot; The only winning move is not to play. &quot; I want to make my peace with me and with Sarah ; that will suffice . So at the end of the month , I told her what came next . Mommy was going_back to work , in spades , about to spend six months researching a book that would keep me out of the house most of the week . I tried to be as matter-of-fact about it as I could , but I was wildly ambivalent . Not that I wanted , any longer , to be home full time . All I really wanted was choice -- which is , when you think_about it , what any mother wants , the opportunity to do what she thinks is best . Sarah wasn ' t ambivalent at all . Her little face got long , and the edges of her mouth and eyes seemed to dip ever so slightly . &quot; I am sad to hear you say that , &quot; she said . &quot; I know , &quot; I said . &quot; It makes me sad , too . But do you think you and I could make a plan for special time together ? &quot; Instantly the skies parted , and the sun shone through . &quot; Like what ? &quot; she asked . &quot; Oh , &quot; I said , shuffling madly for an answer , &quot; how about nighttime play dates ? we ' ll get Daddy to make dinner , and as soon as I walk in the door , we ' ll just play until bedtime. &quot; She was thrilled by the idea , and too polite to remind me that her father ' s idea of cooking a meal is paying_for takeout . Life was back to normal . I am Sarah ' s mother and Larry ' s wife and the book ' s author , and if I have time for a monthly haircut , I ' ll feel that I ' ve indulged myself . On bad days , I feel_like the Oakland of human_beings ; as Gertrude Stein said , there is no there , there . But most of the time it ' s OK . Really . The reflected light can be quite nice . The next day Sarah walked into what she considers our office , put a sheet_of_paper in the electric_typewriter , typed madly for a moment and then handed the indecipherable results to me . &quot; Want me to read it to you ? &quot; she asked . &quot; Sure. &quot; She pointed to the letters and recited , &quot; I love you Karen . When you are the best working_girl I can love you very much. &quot;</TEXT>
