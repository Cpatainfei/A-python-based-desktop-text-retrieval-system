   <HEADLINE> ITO REJECTS DEFENSE BID TO BAR SEIZED EVIDENCE ; SIMPSON CASE : RULING DEFEATS EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE ITEMS FROM DEFENDANT ' S ESTATE , INCLUDING GLOVE , BLOODSTAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Returning to the volatile issues of police credibility and the lawfulness of searches , Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito ruled Wednesday that new questions about whether officers lied on the stand during O.J. Simpson ' s preliminary hearing cannot be used to suppress evidence they seized . Ito also upheld the right of investigators to test blood found at Simpson ' s estate , rejecting an unusual defense argument that police should have secured a separate warrant to justify those tests because they can reveal private information about the person from whom the blood was drawn . Ito called that argument by Simpson attorney Gerald F . Uelmen &quot; rather interesting and novel , &quot; but said he could find no case_law to support it . The rulings Wednesday struck_down the latest efforts by Simpson ' s lawyers to exclude a number of potentially significant items from evidence -- including a bloody glove found outside Simpson ' s house and blood recovered from his driveway . Although Ito ' s rulings do not guarantee that any of those items will be introduced as evidence , they remove obstacles for prosecutors . The search that yielded the bloody glove has been contested on several grounds , each time unsuccessfully , and Simpson ' s lawyers are still moving_on one last front , hoping to show that they should be allowed to renew their objections to that search based on allegations that Detective Mark Fuhrman is a racist . For months , Simpson ' s lawyers have waged an aggressive attack on Fuhrman ' s credibility and have suggested that he might have planted the glove outside Simpson ' s home . On Wednesday , Simpson ' s attorneys renewed their campaign against Fuhrman , arguing that they had only learned many of the specifics of the detective ' s alleged racism after the preliminary hearing was over . Because of that , they asked Ito to let them reopen the argument about the initial search of Simpson ' s estate , during which Fuhrman said he found the bloody glove on a walkway at the back of Simpson ' s home . In a sworn declaration obtained by The Times , a lawyer who alerted Simpson ' s defense_team to allegations about Fuhrman said he delivered a copy of a pension file involving the detective July 15 , after the preliminary hearing ended . In that file , Fuhrman is quoted making racially inflammatory remarks . The statement by lawyer Robert Deutsch could help corroborate Simpson attorneys ' contention that they became aware of new details about Fuhrman after the preliminary hearing ended , even though the file was in the public record and Deutsch said his initial contact with defense_lawyer Robert L . Shapiro ' s office was July 5 , while the hearing was under way . Ito deferred a ruling on reopening the issue of the search based on questions about Fuhrman ' s credibility . He is expected to return to it in the coming week , however , because he is trying to resolve the lingering evidentiary issues before jury selection resumes Oct . 12 . In the meantime , Ito rejected the latest defense attempts to discredit the officers who searched Simpson ' s estate after the discovery of the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to the June 12 murders , and his attorneys maintain that he is the victim of sloppy and overzealous investigators . In court Wednesday , defense_attorney Gerald F . Uelmen said that recently obtained transcripts from a private security company raise questions about the truthfulness of sworn testimony by some officers . Uelmen read transcripts of calls between Westec Security officials and LAPD officers in which the dispatcher from the private Westec firm said officers were at Simpson ' s front_door and about to force entry when they first called to see whether he was home . According to the transcripts that Uelmen read , a Westec patrol officer informed a dispatcher at 5:23 a.m. on June 13 that police_officers were &quot; at the front_door , and they are requesting entrance. &quot; One minute later , that dispatcher , in a conversation with an LAPD sergeant at the West Los Angeles station , said : &quot; I am going_to call the residence right now to see if anyone is there because my patrol officer said you guys are there at his front door. &quot; Sgt . David Rossi of the LAPD responded : &quot; Yeah , we are. &quot; If true , that could contradict testimony that the police only entered the property after first trying to reach Simpson over the phone . During the preliminary hearing , officers said they had repeatedly tried to telephone Simpson from outside the estate but had only reached an answering machine . The detectives testified that they finally decided to jump the wall after seeing a small red stain -- it later turned_out to be blood -- on the door handle of Simpson ' s Ford Bronco and after learning through Westec that Simpson had a live-in maid . Those discoveries raised their fears that additional victims could be inside the estate , the detectives testified . Defense_lawyers have disputed those statements , maintaining that the officers jumped Simpson ' s fence to engage in an illegal search of the property . Citing the transcripts that he read in court Wednesday , Uelmen accused the LAPD officers of presenting a &quot; well-orchestrated tissue of lies. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark responded by saying that the transcripts were unclear and that neither the Westec dispatcher nor the LAPD sergeant was at the scene . Moreover , she maintained that the officers could have been referring to the front gate when the officers said they were at the front_door . In addition , Clark noted that the Simpson team could have raised the issue earlier and neglected to , making_it improper for them to do so now . Under California law , attorneys must choose whether to try to suppress evidence either in Municipal Court or Superior_Court but may_not do so in both places unless new facts emerge that were unavailable to them during the earlier hearing . During the preliminary hearing , several officers testified about cellular_phone calls between the detectives and Westec . The defense did not act_on that information at that time , however , and only raised it recently because Simpson ' s lawyers obtained the transcripts after prosecutors secured them through a subpoena . Clark disputed the defense ' s rationale for failing to act sooner . She said defense_lawyers knew from the preliminary hearing that officers were communicating with Westec via cellular_phone . &quot; They did nothing about it , &quot; Clark said . &quot; They had the opportunity and they failed to do so. &quot; Without addressing the question of whether he believed the transcripts raised new doubts about the detectives ' credibility , Ito agreed that defense_attorneys had missed their chance to raise those points . That ended that defense challenge , but Simpson ' s lawyers moved simultaneously to contest an array of other searches . One involved the seizure of a pair of Simpson ' s shoes June 13 , and that too was challenged Wednesday . Although the objection to that seizure was based on vague language in a property report , attorney Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . used his questions about the shoes to raise other issues about the search . Breaking frequently to consult with an animated Simpson , Cochran asked LAPD Detective Tom Lange whether the detective had seen a large amount_of_money in Simpson ' s closet at_the_same_time he took the shoes . Lange , who said Simpson was with him with he took the shoes , said he had not seen any money . Cochran did not pursue that line of questioning , and Ito ruled that the shoes had been properly seized . As Wednesday ' s hearing continued , Simpson ' s lawyers pressed ahead with their efforts to force the exclusion of certain other items of evidence , most notably papers , fibers , debris and bloodstains recovered from Simpson ' s car when it was repeatedly searched at a police garage . The difficulty with those searches is that an employee of the towing company broke_into the Bronco while it was being held and stole receipts from it . That threatens the chain of custody that protects evidence from being contaminated , and Uelmen painstakingly questioned the towing service manager about gaps in the supervision of the car . The manager , Robert B . Jones , conceded that one of his employees had apparently broken_into the car , but denied that detectives had failed to place the vehicle under an &quot; investigative hold. &quot; Simpson ' s lawyers hope to establish that the LAPD lifted that hold while the car was in the garage . If so , that would strengthen their argument that police have badly bungled the investigation . Clark , however , countered that the Police_Department had maintained its hold_over the car throughout , and that the break-in did not compromise any of the evidence seized . The defense ' s courtroom efforts drew a skeptical comment from one of Nicole Brown Simpson ' s sisters who has regularly attended the hearings . Speaking briefly to reporters Wednesday , Denise Brown questioned why defense_attorneys are contesting evidence if Simpson has nothing to hide . &quot; If O.J. is so innocent , why are ( his defense_lawyers ) trying to suppress all_the evidence ? &quot; As the debates over evidence continue , both sides are gearing_up for an extensive court hearing on the admissibility of DNA tests that are being conducted on blood samples from the murder scene , as well as Simpson ' s home and car . Late Wednesday , the defense filed a motion that challenges the admissibility of the DNA tests by asserting that the process is not generally accepted in the scientific community . &quot; The prosecution seeks to introduce DNA evidence derived from a variety of testing methods , &quot; says the defense motion , written by DNA specialists Barry C . Scheck and Peter J . Neufeld . &quot; Many of these methods are novel : Some have never been reviewed for admissibility by an appellate_court in California , some have never been reviewed by any appellate_court anywhere. &quot; That argument has long been predicted and sets the stage for what could be the trial ' s most important debate -- the so-called Kelly-Frye hearing that will determine whether DNA results are admitted and , if so , how much statistical significance jurors can attach_to any findings . * THE SPIN : Pulling the plug won ' t cool_off trial coverage .
