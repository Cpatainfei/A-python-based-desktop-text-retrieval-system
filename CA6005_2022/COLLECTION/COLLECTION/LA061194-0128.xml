   <HEADLINE> INFLATION NEWS AIDS STOCKS , BUT YIELDS RISE TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks posted solid gains Friday on surprisingly mild inflation data , but less favorable aspects of the report sent long-term bond yields higher and the dollar lower . The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.31 to 3 # 773.45 , up 1.23 for the week . In the broader market , advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where volume totaled 222.62 million shares . The stocks of economically sensitive companies rose after the Labor_Department reported that the producer_price_index fell 0.1 % in May -- the second straight monthly drop_in a row -- compared to an expected increase of 0.2 % . The drop_in the price_index lessened the threat of further credit tightening by the Federal_Reserve_Board , which has raised short-term interest_rates four times this year . But the bond and currency markets were alarmed by a 0.4 % rise in the so-called core producer_price_index , which excludes volatile food and energy prices . The increase was the biggest since January and was slightly higher than the 0.3 % that analysts were predicting . It suggested that the Fed ' s moves to raise interest_rates this year may_not have choked_off economic_growth , as had been feared . This caused nervousness among bond- and dollar-based investors , who fear that the value of their holdings might be eroded . The yield on the Treasury ' s main 30-year bond closed at 7.31 % from 7.27 % on Thursday .
