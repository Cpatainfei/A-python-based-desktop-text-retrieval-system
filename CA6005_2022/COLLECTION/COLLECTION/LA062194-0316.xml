   <HEADLINE> POSTSCRIPT ; A NEW THEORY ON ' 84 BOMB MYSTERY ; ARGENTINE MERCENARY LINKED TO SANDINISTAS IS SUSPECTED IN ATTACK ON CONTRA LEADER ' S NEWS_CONFERENCE 10 YEARS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ten years ago , a group of Costa Rican and American journalists ventured into the night , bound for a secret rendezvous with guerrilla leader Eden Pastora . As the news_conference began in a jungle hide-out in southern Nicaragua , a bomb intended for Pastora shattered the room , killing an American journalist , two Costa Rican colleagues and a number of Pastora ' s aides . Pastora , the fabled Comandante Zero of the revolution that ousted Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza , was gravely wounded but survived . The bombing at La Penca became one of the most notorious and mysterious incidents of the long war between Nicaragua ' s Sandinista regime and U.S.-backed Contra rebels , who by that time included Pastora . Suspects were plentiful but evidence scant . Most accusers blamed the CIA , and the Costa Rican government indicted two CIA operatives . Now , a decade later , a new explanation has emerged . A Costa Rican congressional commission , concluding a 3 1 / 2-year-long investigation , blamed the bombing on an Argentine terrorist who operated in Nicaragua under the 1979-1990 Sandinista regime . The orders to assassinate Pastora came from deep within the Sandinista Interior Ministry , said Sonia Rodriguez , president of the commission . &quot; The attack at La Penca is the maximum revelation of the desire to eliminate Eden Pastora , and although there existed other groups that considered Pastora an obstacle to their interests , it is clear that the person who executed the act was intimately tied to a section of the Sandinista Front government , &quot; the commission said in a 200-page report . Some pieces of the La Penca puzzle were known within days of the May 30 , 1984 , explosion . The bomb had been placed inside a camera bag and smuggled into the news_conference by a man posing as a Danish journalist named Per Anker Hansen . The last television footage taken by a Costa Rican cameraman who was killed in the explosion , Jorge Quiros , showed &quot; Hansen &quot; sneaking_out of the hut where the news_conference was taking_place seconds before the bomb was triggered by remote_control . Hansen feigned injuries himself and then vanished after he and 20 badly injured journalists were evacuated from the jungle . During the years that followed , survivors , journalists and other investigators chased down numerous leads in a quest to find_out who Hansen was and who he was working for . Pastora , the flamboyant guerrilla fighter , had plenty of enemies to choose from . He had betrayed his Sandinista comrades . He spooked the CIA , which considered him unreliable . He resisted the U.S._government ' s grand scheme of uniting Pastora ' s rebel front in southern Nicaragua with Contras in the north . * But all efforts to close this chapter of dirty tricks failed . Finally , new information emerged that pointed investigators in the direction of the Sandinistas . Using recently discovered fingerprints , the Costa Rican commission identified the bomber as Vital Roberto Ganguine , a member of the leftist Argentine People ' s Revolutionary Army , which allied_with the Sandinistas in the 1970s . Ganguine , along with other revolutionaries from all_over Latin_America , worked for a shadowy intelligence and espionage unit within the Sandinista Interior Ministry . Investigators matched a fingerprint from official Argentine records with those on Hansen ' s immigration documents for Panama to prove that Hansen was Ganguine . The Costa Rican investigation largely confirmed the results of a multinational probe conducted last year by the Miami Herald and a group of Argentine journalists and U.S. free-lance reporter Douglas Vaughan , who is credited with turning_up the Panamanian immigration documents . Vaughan at one time worked as an investigator for the Christic Institute in its $ 23-million lawsuit that accused 28 Contras , CIA operatives and others of conspiracy in the La Penca bombing . The plaintiffs were Tony Avirgan , a television cameraman who was wounded in the bombing , and his wife , Martha Honey , for whom proving CIA involvement became a crusade in the years after the bombing . A federal judge threw_out the suit in 1988 , saying it was frivolous , and ordered the plaintiffs to pay court fees . Both the Costa Rican commission and the Herald reported that Ganguine was said to have been killed in a 1989 Argentine guerrilla attack on the La Tablada army barracks near Buenos Aires . But the Costa Rican investigators said Ganguine ' s body was never identified , and an arrest order remains in_effect in Argentina . The Sandinista Front , which governed Nicaragua from its overthrow of Somoza in 1979 until its upset loss in 1990 presidential elections , denied the reports that it was involved in the La Penca bombing . Otherwise , the news surprisingly has had little impact in Managua -- in part because Pastora ' s profile has been eclipsed by time , and partly because the Sandinista Front is caught_up in more immediate crises and more recent scandals . &quot; Maybe it ' s just old news , &quot; a diplomat in Managua said . &quot; Eden Pastora isn ' t that important anymore . The judgment now is what dirt can you get_on your enemies today. &quot; Among the survivors whose lives were shattered 10 years ago , there is mixed reaction . In her new book , &quot; Hostile Acts : U.S. Policy in Costa Rica in the 1980s , &quot; Honey indicates that she and Avirgan believe the bomber was Ganguine . They investigated the new information themselves and were able to place &quot; Hansen &quot; in Sandinista Nicaragua . But some of the other survivors remain convinced of CIA involvement . They argue that if the Sandinistas were responsible , the U.S._government , eager throughout the 1980s to publicize any and all negative news on the leftist Nicaraguan regime , would have made_sure the story got_out before now . Since that didn ' t happen , these survivors conclude , Ganguine was not the man .</TEXT>
