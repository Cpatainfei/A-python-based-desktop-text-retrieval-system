   <HEADLINE> 500 # 000 AFFECTED BY MTA STRIKE ; LABOR : WALKOUT BY MECHANICS IS HONORED BY DRIVERS AND CLERKS , TAKING 85 % OF BUSES OFF STREETS . NO FURTHER TALKS ARE SCHEDULED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles staggered to work Monday , car-pooling , hailing cabs , hitchhiking and even walking on the first day of a bus and train strike that left more_than half a_million riders desperately searching for other modes of transportation . The walkout by the Metropolitan Transit Authority ' s 1 # 900 mechanics -- honored by 5 # 000 bus and rail drivers and transit clerks -- came_after talks on a new contract broke_down between the MTA and the mechanics union late Sunday night . Although unions representing the drivers and clerks reached tentative last-minute contract agreements , they decided to support the mechanics ' strike . It was the first shutdown of the nation ' s second-largest transit system since 1982 , when drivers walked_off the job for five days . It was a day of aggravation , uncertainty , sore feet and occasional violence by striking workers who viewed themselves as pawns in the MTA ' s desperate effort to balance its annual budget of nearly $ 3 billion . In Beverly Hills , three striking drivers attempted to hijack an MTA bus driven by a temporary driver about noon , police said . The suspects boarded the bus and threatened the driver with violence while the sole passenger aboard fled , said Lt . John Dunkin , an LAPD spokesman . Two were arrested . The strike ' s full effect on traffic was not expected to be felt until today , when more bus and train riders , having more time to plan , turn_to cars . &quot; A lot of people just didn ' t go_to work ; some people just got scared_off , &quot; said Jerry Baxter , director of the local Caltrans office . On Day 1 : * Riders waited for hours in vain as only about 15 % of the buses hit the streets . Because the strike was not called until after midnight , many riders were unaware of it until they showed_up at their bus_stops . Only about 310 buses -- compared to the normal 1 # 200 -- rolled on the 30 busiest routes , and service was limited to between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Substitute buses included yellow school_buses driven by private drivers hired by the transit agency at a total cost of $ 160 # 000 a day . White_paper covered the word school and the MTA ' s &quot; circle M &quot; symbol was added_to the front , sides and rear of the buses . As the news sunk_in , some called taxicabs , which reported booming business . Some raised their thumbs and hitchhiked , drawing occasional cooperation from commuters . Others called friends , and many simply gave_up and went_home . Moaned one San Fernando Valley rider : &quot; I have to pray for a ride. &quot; * No further negotiations were scheduled . There were signs that the strike could be prolonged because the main sticking point -- the transit agency ' s desire to contract_out some work done_by unionized mechanics -- is a life-or-death issue to organized labor in many sectors of the economy . Complained Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , an MTA board_member : &quot; The mechanics , representing less than a third of the ( striking ) work_force , have disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Angelenos -- all_in order to preserve archaic work rules that reward inefficiency and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. &quot; Responded Joe Drouin , a shop_steward for the Amalgamated Transit Union , who was walking on a picket_line outside a bus yard in Downtown Los Angeles : &quot; We ' re fighting for our livelihood. &quot; * The lack of buses caused unusually high absenteeism in schools across the city . At Crenshaw High_School , about 500 students out of 1 # 600 were absent Monday . &quot; Our attendance is down significantly due_to the bus strike , &quot; said Jacqueline Wyse , the summer school_principal . &quot; I hope it ' s not going_to go long-term . We have a lot of kids who want to be here. &quot; * The alleged hijacking attempt by striking drivers was the harshest action of the day . It was foiled when police_officers noticed the bus pulled over in an odd spot near Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards and boarded it . Five-year MTA driver Benjamin Leyva and seven-year driver Ace Brawner , both of Los Angeles , were arrested and booked on suspicion of robbery . Police were seeking a third suspect , who fled . &quot; We don ' t advocate this ; we don ' t condone it . We certainly regret it , &quot; said Goldy Norton , spokesman for the United Transportation Union . &quot; Sometimes people just do things they shouldn ' t do . We think it ' s absolutely the wrong thing to do. &quot; The MTA reported 40 acts of vandalism against buses and property Monday . The city ' s Department_of_Transportation reported that eggs and rocks were thrown at city DASH buses and that a rock broke the windshield of a Commuter Express_bus . The MTA pledged to go_to court Wednesday to seek a temporary restraining order to limit union picketing at its properties . On the Streets At street_corners throughout town , despair set_in early among the transit-dependent who make the vast majority of the 1.2 million daily boardings of MTA buses . Bea Alexander , who lives_in Hollywood and works Downtown as a secretary , was fuming as she sat in a friend ' s house , waiting for a car ride that would get her to work hours late . Alexander , a regular MTA bus rider on a line that runs_on Sunset Boulevard , said she watched the 11 p.m. news Sunday to see whether there was a strike , saw that it was still up_in_the_air , then went_to_bed and rose to get_to her regular bus_stop at 6:45 a.m. She waited 20 minutes . Then another rider , listening to the news on headphones , found_out about the strike . Alexander said she was mad that MTA had not provided any alternate bus_service on Sunset , a main artery toward Downtown . &quot; I stood_out there with a woman with a walker who was trying to get_to a doctor . I don ' t understand what people think we ' re going to do -- jump in our Mercedes ? Call a friend at 5:30 ( a.m. ) and say , ' Pick me up ? ' &quot; People who ride the buses , we ' re already challenged -- disabled people , elderly people , handicapped people , hard-working people who get_up at 5 a.m. to get a 6 a.m. bus . To stand_out and get treated like this because we don ' t own a car -- in a city where no one should own a car -- is ridiculous. &quot; In West Los Angeles , Santa Monica office manager Joyce Cohan waited 20 minutes at a bus_stop before she learned of the work_stoppage . &quot; It ' s going_to be a problem , &quot; she said . &quot; I have no other way to get_to work. &quot; After waiting an hour in Wilmington for a bus that never arrived , Holson Chang Lee walked 4 1 / 2 hours before he reached his Crenshaw home . The security_guard , who got_off work_at midnight , reached home at 5:30 a.m. At 8 a.m. , he again waited for a ride , this time to take him to the bank so he could withdraw $ 1 # 600 to purchase a car . In the San Fernando Valley , riders waited patiently and impatiently for buses to appear . By 7:45 a.m. more_than 50 people crowded three stops at Van Nuys and Ventura boulevards in Sherman Oaks , a major transfer point . At the corner of Van Nuys and Roscoe boulevards in Panorama City , a man waiting at a stop shouted to a friend in a passing car : &quot; Come on , man , I ' ve been waiting three hours ! &quot; Laura Rios , 20 , of Van Nuys , kept checking her watch , now edging_up on 9:30 a.m. &quot; I have to be at_work at 10 , &quot; said Rios , who was waiting with others at the bus_stop at Sepulveda and Roscoe boulevards in Van Nuys . She works_at a McDonald ' s restaurant in North Hollywood , on Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Victory Boulevard . She said she hadn ' t heard about the strike . &quot; No wonder there ' s no bus , &quot; she said in Spanish . &quot; I ' ve been waiting here since before 9. &quot; After learning of the strike , she said , &quot; I ' m going home. &quot; Lou Cline and his wife finally gave_up waiting and started to walk home from the stop on Sepulveda and Vose Street . &quot; Every day we take two buses to the senior center at Victory and Coldwater , &quot; said Cline , 85 . &quot; We have our friends there , have a little fun , a little entertainment . Thank God I feel good_enough to want to go_to the center. &quot; Instead , the couple must stay home until the buses begin running again . Pedro Ocampo was at the pay phones at Saticoy Street and Sepulveda telling his boss he was not going_to be able to work Monday . &quot; I work in San Fernando , and I don ' t have a way to get there , &quot; said the 37-year-old gardener . &quot; I ' ll just have to see about getting a ride there tomorrow. &quot; Searching for Alternatives Commuters left stranded by the strike were desperately calling taxicab companies in unprecedented numbers , often from bus_stops and street_corners . Some taxi dispatchers reported their business was double that of a normal workday . &quot; Well , ( the strike ) might be bad news to the bus riders , but not to the taxi drivers , &quot; said Belinda Esnayra , a public_service agent for Checker Cab Co. , whose business shot_up 40 % during the morning commute . &quot; It ' s amazing how many people depend_on the bus. &quot; Still , the wait for a taxi was often more_than an hour during rush_hour , and cab_fares were a far_cry from $ 1.10 bus rides . &quot; We are very , very busy , &quot; explained Mae Caringal , a secretary at United Independent Taxi who was helping_out with dispatching Monday morning because of the extra workload . All 231 drivers were_on the road Monday instead of the usual 100 at a time , she said . People on street_corners even tried to flag_down the Skycar service , which mainly drives travelers to LAX , said dispatcher Tylee James . &quot; There are a lot of very desperate-sounding people who ' ve got_to get_to work , got_to get somewhere and don ' t have buses to do that , &quot; James said , adding that his drivers are trying to help_out as much as they can . MTA board_member John Fasana asked employers to be tolerant . &quot; We ' re urging all employers to cut a little extra slack for their employees today . It may be a little difficult for them to get_to work , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re asking everybody to try to help each other out over these next few days. &quot; Riders on the regular MTA buses were charged 50 cents Monday . Passengers on school_buses rode for free because the buses have no fare collection equipment . The bus system will operate only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m in the initial days of the strike . Service on the Metro Red and Blue Lines will be virtually unaffected , but the trains will operate only on weekdays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Blue Line trains that ran from Downtown Los Angeles stopped at the Willow Street station in Long_Beach instead of continuing to the southern terminus in Long_Beach . Long_Beach buses ferried train riders to the end of the line . The Negotiating Stalemate Contracts between the MTA and its three major unions expired June 30 . The transit agency reached a tentative agreement at 3:15 p.m. Sunday with the United Transportation Union representing drivers and at 2 a.m. Monday with the Transportation Communications Union representing clerks . But the Amalgamated Transit Union and the transit agency remained at loggerheads over the issue of subcontracting . MTA officials want to contract_out some work now performed by union mechanics , such_as making parts . At a news_conference at MTA headquarters Monday , officials said it costs the agency more to have union workers make dustpans and mop buckets than to buy them at a store . Union mechanics are skeptical of the transit agency ' s assurances that no employees will be laid_off . They regard subcontracting as a union-busting tactic and say it could reduce their wages and result in poorer quality work . &quot; They put subcontracting on the table , which is definitely something we are not going_to agree to -- that ' s taking_away our work and giving it to other people , &quot; said Mike Bujosa , president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated Transit Union . MTA chief negotiator Gordon Krischer said , &quot; There are items that we can purchase for less outside than it costs to make inside. &quot; He said that under the proposal on the table , union mechanics would be given an opportunity to bid on the work . &quot; Let our own employees bid on this work , &quot; he said . The union also opposes the MTA ' s desire to reduce the hourly wage for newly hired mechanics . The strike drew attention in the governor ' s race . State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , the Democratic candidate for governor , said she would have used the governor ' s power to order a 60-day cooling-off period -- a move Republican Gov . Pete Wilson has refused to make . &quot; You ' ve got thousands of people who are inconvenienced , who are not_able to get_to their work , &quot; she said . &quot; That causes a ripple effect in the whole Southern California economy . . . . A cooling-off period would be most appropriate . that ' s what you have those laws for. &quot; Wilson said Democrats and Republicans on the MTA board had asked him not to intercede . Mayor Richard Riordan had said he was concerned that delaying the strike until September would give the unions more leverage because the walkout would occur as more students were to school . Nevertheless , the strike appeared to be affecting the Los Angeles Unified School District ' s summer program , in which about 65 # 000 students are enrolled . Idelle Thaler , assistant principal of Birmingham High_School in Van Nuys , said she was advising students &quot; to call_up all their friends and neighbors and family members -- cousins , aunts and uncles -- to try to get a ride here . The vast majority of these kids are here for very specific reasons and this is very difficult on them. &quot; Contributing to the MTA strike coverage were Times staff writers David Colker , Aaron Curtiss , Sam Enriquez , Larry Gordon , Nicholas Riccardi , Tim Rutten , Beth Shuster , Amy Wallace and Timothy Williams and community correspondent Simon Romero .
