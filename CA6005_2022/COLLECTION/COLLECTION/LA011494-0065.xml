   <HEADLINE> CLINTON AND WHITEWATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In 10 years in Congress I have never seen a more irresponsible piece of journalism than Lars-Erik Nelson ' s Column Left ( Jan . 11 ) on the Whitewater scandal . Nelson writes that over a recent breakfast I &quot; talked easily about impeaching President Clinton &quot; and engaged in &quot; offhand , reckless speculation . . . . &quot; He notes that &quot; the very word impeachment puts his legitimacy as President in doubt , &quot; and adds &quot; Partisan politicians like Armey are joined by the howling jackals of the press in_using the sly weasel_words of accusatory politics. &quot; The first time I ever heard the word impeachment used in connection with Whitewater was when Nelson raised the prospect of impeachment at that breakfast . Nelson quotes me accurately as saying that &quot; these things ( political scandals ) take_off like an amoeba in all directions , &quot; but neglects to note that after he repeatedly pressed me on the prospect of impeachment , I repeatedly told the reporters present that I was not there to talk_about impeaching the President . Here are the points I made : I don ' t know what an investigation will turn_up , but the circumstances certainly merit one . I don ' t know if there ' s anything there that would lead to impeachment , and have never heard the prospect discussed by any Republican in Congress . Political manipulation of a government-guaranteed savings and loan for personal gain is a serious charge , and I think the President should be forthcoming with information . Nelson ' s column is like the old &quot; when did you stop beating your wife &quot; line . He asks me about impeaching the President , I answer his question , then he blasts me for &quot; talk ( ing ) easily about impeaching President Clinton. &quot; What a crock . I feel sorry_for his readers . REP . DICK ARMEY R-Tex . * Why it is that , contrary to our system ' s having placed the burden_of_proof on the prosecution , the Clintons must prove their innocence -- to the satisfaction of clearly partisan Republicans and the so-called &quot; liberal &quot; press -- of incredibly vague , unspecified and wholly unsubstantiated allegations , based on nothing but speculative innuendo and accusatory conjecture ? And especially since Republicans , with their record of formal indictments and convictions , and legacy of insulting the public with thoroughly implausible denials of wrongdoing , have conveniently pardoned themselves from the rule_of_law , proclaiming that their self-serving conspiracies , cover-ups and sundry other violations of the Constitution were motivated by &quot; patriotism , &quot; and the mainstream media just yawned ? Should an independent counsel be appointed to investigate the unspecified wrongdoing which the Republicans have suggested were behind Bill_Clinton ' s student visa to Moscow ? If not for that , then why for this ( and vice versa ) ? Why isn ' t the press ' focus instead on the monumental hypocrisy , pathological cynicism , and basic Joe McCarthy character which motivate the Republicans ? BRIAN ZICK Los Angeles * Oliver North and George_Bush should immediately offer their shredding machines to Bill and Hillary Clinton as a gesture of goodwill . BOB JONES San Juan Capistrano * Apparently the NAFTA treaty has dissolved and all remembrance of it has died . It was so nice to see the two warring army ' s join and fight together for a common goal . But the civil_war rages on ; the Democratic army is digging_in to protect itself from the Republican barrage . The new hill to be taken : Whitewatergate . Leading the troops is Gen . Bob Dole , who has been heard rallying the troops by yelling , &quot; Remember Iran Contra. &quot; Oh , who could forget that victory , the &quot; I don ' t remember &quot; and &quot; I wasn ' t present &quot; battle_cries rang_out to keep the casualties to a single marine . Long live the memory of Oliver North . Will this battle have the same outcome ? I believe so . Commander_in_Chief Clinton has his top tacticians and strategists scattering about collecting all_the top secret documents . For if these documents were to fall_into enemy hands , Gen . Dole may have a victory as profound as the one known as the &quot; Battle of Tricky Dick. &quot; While the armies bombard each other with accusations , slander and pointed fingers , little civilian girls get kidnaped and killed , commuters on subways get slaughtered , and the number of gun sales in Los Angeles continues to rise . It is time for both of the armies to put_up the white_flag and return to protecting , serving and being all that they can be for the citizens that enlisted them . SCOTT STARR San Juan Capistrano * I hope Whitewater doesn ' t turn_into whitewash . ROBERT W . DIEHL Burbank</TEXT>
