   <HEADLINE> OUTGOING MEXICO PRESIDENT SEEKS ROLE ON WORLD STAGE ; LATIN_AMERICA : SALINAS IS A TOP CANDIDATE FOR GLOBAL TRADE POST . HIS CLOSE TIES TO THE U.S. COME UNDER SCRUTINY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For six years , Carlos Salinas de Gortari has used the power of the Mexican presidency to transform his nation , cementing a free-market economic revolution and initiating political reform so profound that it has deeply divided his own party . Salinas will turn_over the authority of a virtually unchecked executive_branch to his successor , Ernesto Zedillo , on Thursday . But at age 46 , the Harvard-educated economist hardly seems ready to retire to the life of behind-the-scenes intrigue that usually occupies former presidents here . More_than any Mexican president in two decades , Salinas appears intent_on playing an international role . He is one of three leading candidates for the top position in the World Trade Organization to be created as a successor to the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the largest international trade pact , with 124 members . Salinas brings_to his bid a striking record of having converted an inward-looking , protectionist country into a leading free-trader , a member of the most important international economic organizations and a founding partner in the world ' s largest trading bloc , the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . At the same time , the possibility that he might head the economic equivalent of the United Nations , equipped to tear_down barriers to trade and investment around the world , has made his administration a subject of closer international scrutiny than Mexican leaders usually receive . Along with the economic accomplishments , such_as slashing triple-digit inflation to about 7 % in six years , there have been political pitfalls . Salinas leaves_office with a peasant rebellion still simmering in the southern state of Chiapas and two major political assassinations still unsolved . Election reforms guaranteed that his successor was chosen Aug . 21 in the cleanest polls since the Institutional Revolutionary Party began ruling the country 65 years ago . Still , those elections were fraught with irregularities , observers said , and fraud was again rampant in state elections in Jalisco and Tabasco earlier this month . Further , even modest attempts at political reform have set_off a battle within the ruling party . Polls show most Mexicans believe that political infighting was behind the murders of Luis Donaldo Colosio , Salinas ' first choice for a successor , and Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the second-ranking party official . Serious questions even exist about who has benefited from economic reforms . Two dozen Mexicans have made the Forbes magazine list of the world ' s richest people . Mexico was one of a handful of developing countries that have actually reduced the number of citizens living_in absolute poverty , according to a recent United Nations report , but half of the workers still earn less than $ 12 a day . Both the accomplishments and the problems have been reported widely , especially since Salinas has made what appears to be the final round in the World Trade Organization selections . That Mexico and Salinas should be taken so seriously in international circles is in itself a feat hardly anyone could have imagined six years ago , when the short , balding man with the big ears took_office . Cartoonists called him &quot; Dumbo &quot; in an astounding display of disrespect in this usually deferential country . Many observers seriously doubted whether he could govern Mexico , as opposition parties protesting election_fraud were cleared from the main plaza with tear_gas only hours before his inauguration . In the following weeks and months , Salinas won through his actions the legitimacy denied him at the polls . He arrested a powerful union boss , imprisoned a prominent financier and started a bold economic program of selling_off hundreds of government-owned companies , balancing the federal budget and reviving international investment . Nearly three-fourths of the 2 # 550 Mexicans questioned earlier this month in a nationwide Indemerc Louis Harris poll said the country was better_off now than when Salinas took_office in 1988 . How Salinas achieved those accomplishments -- as much as the accomplishments themselves -- is being considered in judging his ability to head the World Trade Organization . For example , NAFTA , the historic trade pact among the United States , Mexico and Canada , will turn 11 months old the day Salinas steps_down . The agreement is both the greatest asset and the major drawback in his bid to head the proposed trade organization . &quot; The impact of NAFTA worldwide is an important part of his credentials , &quot; said Gabriel Szekely , an expert on Mexico-Asia trade and investment . &quot; For economies of such diversity to be able to negotiate and to achieve such a degree of liberalization , getting_into several areas that not even GATT did &quot; is a notable achievement . At the same time , heading a nation that is part of NAFTA and depends_on the United States for three-fourths of its foreign trade makes Salinas appear too close to Washington for the tastes of European and Asian_countries , said Szekely . &quot; They see the Salinas government as being completely sold_out to the U.S._government , &quot; he said . Ironically , that is the same criticism leveled at the outgoing president by opponents of free_trade in his own country . Salinas missed an opportunity to change that perception -- at least internationally -- at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Indonesia earlier this month . Asian members looked_to Mexico for support in their opposition to Super 301 , a section of American trade law that allows the United States to unilaterally impose tariffs of up_to 100 % on countries deemed to have erected the most egregious trade_barriers . They were disappointed . The limitations of Salinas ' contacts in Europe are evidenced by Mexico ' s failure to attract more investment from across the Atlantic , said Mexican economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O . The perceived closeness to the United States may have tarnished Salinas ' image more among trading nations than the political upheaval that has occurred in the wake of his economic reform . On the other hand , the other candidates -- former Italian Trade Minister Renato Ruggiero and former Korean Industry and Trade Minister Kim Chul-su -- also have strong regional ties to overcome . As a result , Salinas ' qualifications for founding director of the proposed new trade organization hinge largely on his ability to reconcile conflicting interests . The director of the World Trade Organization is expected to be mainly a conciliator . &quot; The job can carry considerable clout , depending_on the skills of the person , &quot; said Patrick Low , an economist who has worked_at GATT and written extensively on international trade_policy . &quot; But you have to have a mediator &quot; in the post . Throughout his administration , Salinas emphasized public shows of reaching consensus . Labor and business_leaders were called_in to negotiate the pactos , the economic agreements on Mexican wages and prices that were used to bring inflation under_control and restore economic_growth . Both groups also advised the NAFTA negotiators . &quot; Mexico has changed enormously during his presidency , and he has led it , &quot; said Low , who has also served as a visiting scholar at the prestigious El Colegio de Mexico graduate_school in Mexico_City . &quot; He has often had to work very hard for consensus. &quot; But behind the compromises , Salinas always had the enforcement power of the presidency . &quot; Definitely the powers of the presidency were overarching &quot; in achieving domestic consensus , said Szekely . He claims that business and labor_leaders actually did little negotiating in the agreements . &quot; It was just a ' photo op ' with the finance_minister , &quot; he said . Ramirez said not even a president could have made changes as profound as those Mexico has undergone during the past six years without reaching consensus . &quot; Salinas is a great negotiator , &quot; said Ramirez , who is often critical of the government . &quot; He knows how to distinguish which subjects require the maximum attention . He knows how to think strategically . He knows where the trends are going , where the centers of power are and where the trade-offs can be made. &quot; Mexicans themselves are divided over whether they want their outgoing president to be named to the prestigious international position . &quot; He would be an excellent director , &quot; said Ramirez . Others are skeptical about both his chances and qualifications . &quot; I hope he is not elected , &quot; said Szekely . &quot; There are still a lot of accounts to be settled here. &quot;</TEXT>
