   <HEADLINE> SCOTT HARRIS : A LETTER FROM ' EXHIBIT A ' IN ' 3 STRIKES ' DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Got another letter from my pen_pal the other day . that ' s pen as in ballpoint and pen as in penitentiary . Brian Simpson recognized the pun before I did . Now it ' s truer than ever because Simpson , a thrice-convicted felon , has been transferred from jail to state_prison . When I first wrote_about Simpson in January , he was facing a 17-year sentence . As it turned_out , he accepted a plea bargain with a 12-year term . As always , Simpson reports from Wasco State_Prison , I ' ve landed on my feet , ever the wily convict , yet an anomaly amongst the ' peckerwoods ' ( white inmates ) : a college_man , well-spoken , articulate , clean-cut &amp; shaven , no ' tacks ' ( tattoos. ) This generally works to my advantage , this professorial aspect , but can backfire ( there are times to be a &quot; wood , &quot; when a high-falutin ' vocab . isn ' t appreciated. ) Brian ' s letters always make me leery . You have to worry about a con . that ' s con as in convict and con as in con job . Still , as California contemplates building 20 more prisons and committing $ 2 billion a year to operate them , Simpson is a decent Exhibit A in the unpopular case against &quot; three strikes and you ' re out. &quot; * Perhaps you are disappointed that Simpson , 40 , won ' t be spending the rest of his days in prison , as he would if the best-known &quot; three strikes &quot; proposal were now law . If he lived to the age of 80 , that would cost us $ 1 million to house a man who is not prone to violence and might actually join the ranks of law-abiding taxpayers if he could kick his craving for crystal methamphetamine . ( The defense will stipulate that during his last residential burglary , Simpson did swing a Christmas stocking loaded with a metal box when he was surprised by a boarder who happened to be a highway patrolman. ) Simpson may have targeted elderly victims in his burglaries but he didn ' t leave a trail of blood . Perhaps the most interesting thing about this criminal is that he had a middle-class upbringing and was attending UCLA when he spiraled into drugs and crime . This waste of opportunity may be all_the more reason to regard Simpson with contempt . But as California moves toward passage of some version of &quot; three strikes , &quot; the relevant question is whether Simpson ' s punishment fits his crimes . Under California ' s current laws , Simpson may be eligible for parole after six years if he behaves . So is six to 12 years enough for a three-time loser like Simpson ? Or , as the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative proposes , should such a felon be put_away forever ? Fear of crime and outrage over the failures of the criminal justice system -- illustrated by the reckless handling of Richard Alan Davis , the accused killer of Polly Klaas -- have fueled the demand for extreme sentences and has politicians trying to look tough . Gov . Pete Wilson and his Democratic gubernatorial opponents have endorsed the harshest &quot; three strikes &quot; proposal . The National Rifle Assn . touts it as an alternative to gun_control . The prison_guard union , naturally , loves it . The prevailing wisdom in Sacramento , then , is that a creep is a creep is a creep . There is no distinction between the sicko who kidnaps , rapes and kills children and a petty thief armed with a Christmas stocking . All are beyond redemption . Interestingly , politicians closer to the trenches , such_as Sheriff Sherman Block and Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , oppose this measure . Assemblyman Richard K . Rainey ( R-Walnut ) , a former sheriff , has offered perhaps the best alternative to the &quot; three strikes &quot; bill -- one that would impose life imprisonment for a third violent felony , or a third serious felony if the first two were violent . The chief argument against &quot; three strikes &quot; is its expense , which would divert money from education , drug rehab programs , police and prosecutors . For years , California has spent more and more to put people in prison and less and less to educate children . Fifteen years ago , California was one of the top states in spending per student . Now it is near the bottom . More prisons haven ' t discouraged crime but , it seems , weaker schools have encouraged it . Troubled schools , the deterioration of family life , easy access to guns -- all have fueled the ugliness in youth crime . Other arguments deal with practical effects . Doesn ' t the prospect of life imprisonment give felons incentive to murder witnesses ? Garcetti , moreover , predicts a &quot; tremendous jury backlash . Jurors are going_to require more proof than ' beyond a reasonable doubt. ' &quot; Garcetti should know . His office is prosecuting the Menendez boys . The moral argument against &quot; three strikes &quot; is one that no one wants to hear . People like Simpson ' s wife , Christine , and his father , Bob , a retired school_principal , say Brian has let them down in the past , but they believe he may yet redeem himself . Simpson , with credit for a year spent in jail , should be out_in 1999 . He might screw_up again . But maybe he won ' t .</TEXT>
