   <HEADLINE> EMMYS TAKE_ON A ' BLUE ' SHADE ; 26 NODS FOR ' NYPD ' ; BREAK PREVIOUS NOMINATION TOTALS FOR A TV SERIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ABC ' s gritty police drama &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; the target of criticism for its rough language and bits of nudity even before it debuted , on Thursday earned a record-setting 26 Emmy Award nominations from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences . But academy voters again snubbed &quot; Roseanne &quot; as a contender for best comedy series . It has never been nominated in that category in its six seasons on ABC , although the show has won increasing praise and its title star earned her first Emmy as best actress in a comedy series last year . This year , at her request , she was nominated simply under the name Roseanne because of her split with her husband , Tom Arnold . The 26 nominations for &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; in its first season was the highest total ever for a weekly series in one year . The miniseries &quot; Roots , &quot; however , got 37 nominations in the 1976-77 competition . The amount for &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; surpassed the previous series record of 21 , earned by another drama from producer and co-creator Steven Bochco , &quot; Hill Street Blues , &quot; also in its first year , 1980-81 . A third Bochco drama , &quot; L.A. Law , &quot; was next with 20 nominations in its freshman season , 1986-87 . Bochco ' s co-creators on the three landmark television series were Michael Kozoll on &quot; Hill Street Blues , &quot; Terry Louise Fisher on &quot; L.A. Law &quot; and David Milch on &quot; NYPD Blue. &quot; &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; swept all five nominations for best writing in a drama series , and four of the five for best directing . When &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; was launched , the TV industry was intensely under_fire for prime-time violence . The series , which still is not cleared by all ABC affiliates -- but could profit in that area from the Emmy nominations -- became a target for its rough-and-tumble action , in addition to its language and nudity , relatively strong for network TV but mild compared to other show_business forms . Bochco argued that network TV , with its declining audience , had to assume some of the same liberties as cable -- which was drawing_off audiences -- if it hoped to remain competitive in the new age of alternative viewing . The audience responded favorably . &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; ranked a strong 22nd among 128 prime-time network series this past season , attracting on average 23 % of the available viewers each week . &quot; Roseanne , &quot; which tied with &quot; Seinfeld &quot; as the season ' s second-ranked entertainment series -- &quot; Home Improvement &quot; was No . 1 -- earned five Emmy nominations . The other &quot; Roseanne &quot; nominees included lead actor John Goodman and supporting players Laurie Metcalf and Sara Gilbert . The producers of &quot; Roseanne &quot; issued a statement almost identical to the one they released after last year ' s nominations : &quot; Though we are obviously happy about the nominations we did receive , we are also very disappointed that the show was not nominated. &quot; Academy sentiment toward the &quot; Roseanne &quot; program was clear as &quot; Seinfeld &quot; was nominated for best comedy series , along with &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; Home Improvement , &quot; &quot; Mad About You &quot; and &quot; The Larry Sanders Show. &quot; Asked about &quot; Roseanne , &quot; John Leverence , awards director of the television academy , said simply : &quot; It didn ' t get the votes. &quot; In another oddity of the nominations , television ' s top star , Tim Allen of &quot; Home Improvement , &quot; was not nominated because , academy spokesman Mark Rosch said , &quot; He was not entered prior to the entry deadline . There was a request after the deadline to enter him , but the deadline had passed . It was a slip_on his representatives ' part . It was certainly an unfortunate omission. &quot; The Emmy Awards will be televised by ABC Sept . 11 from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium . Network TV , which rebounded slightly in audience tune-in last season , made a comeback Thursday in the prestigious Emmy category of made-for-television movies . Last year , the traditional Big Three networks were shut_out and highly embarrassed as HBO grabbed four of the nominations and PBS the fifth . But the latest nominations of made-for-TV movies included not only HBO ' s drama about AIDS , &quot; And the Band Played On , &quot; but three productions from CBS -- &quot; Gypsy , &quot; &quot; To Dance With the White Dog &quot; and &quot; Breathing Lessons &quot; -- and ABC ' s &quot; A Place for Annie. &quot; Top-rated CBS led in overall Emmy nominations with 91 , while ABC had 73 -- nearly one-third from &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; -- and NBC earned 66 . Fox , despite expanding to seven nights a week , could manage only nine nominations . Pay-cable nominations totaled 63 , more_than half going_to HBO , which had 34 . Distant runners-up to &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; for most nominations were &quot; And the Band Played On , &quot; which had 13 ; &quot; Gypsy , &quot; with Bette Midler , and &quot; Seinfeld , &quot; which tied with 12 each ; &quot; Frasier , &quot; with 11 , and , with 10 , &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; the low-rated but critically praised CBS show that was a surprise winner as best drama series at last year ' s Emmy Awards . It ranked 66th in the ratings this season . NBC ' s &quot; Frasier &quot; stars former &quot; Cheers &quot; regular Kelsey Grammer in his previous role as a pompous psychiatrist who , following a divorce , moves to Seattle , where he becomes host of a radio advice program . He was among the nominees for best actor in a comedy series . In the high-profile late-night competition , the series of both David Letterman and Jay Leno were nominated in the category of best variety , music or comedy shows . But &quot; Late Night With David Letterman , &quot; in its first season on CBS , picked_up seven nominations overall , while NBC ' s &quot; The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &quot; got only three . CBS ' &quot; Northern Exposure , &quot; which led last year ' s nominations with 16 but was trounced at the Emmy Awards ceremony , clearly fell_out of favor with academy voters this season . It earned only four nominations : for best drama series , supporting actor ( Barry Corbin ) , sound editing and sound mixing . The unprecedented total of 26 nominations for &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; included -- in addition to the five writing and four directing honors -- nine for acting , including nods to both of the show ' s stars , David Caruso and Dennis Franz . Regular supporting actors also nominated were Gail O ' Grady , Sharon Lawrence , Amy Brenneman , Nick Turturro and Gordon Clapp . Guest performers nominated for &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; were Penny Fuller and Dan Heday . &quot; And the Band Played On &quot; also picked_up a fistful of acting nominations -- six -- as Matthew Modine was honored for his lead performance , along with supporting players Richard Gere , Ian McKellen , Alan Alda , Lily Tomlin and Swoosie Kurtz . In a sidelight , Faye Dunaway , recently dropped from the stage production of &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; amid heated exchanges , was nominated for a guest performance in ABC ' s &quot; Columbo. &quot; Bochco said that he was &quot; thrilled &quot; by the recognition given &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; -- &quot; for everything we went_through and the battles we fought against the reactionary forces who had negative responses without even seeing the show . And I ' m pleased for ABC . They stuck_by us. &quot; Comparing his reaction to past honors , he said &quot; Hill Street Blues &quot; was satisfying because , at the time of the nominations , it &quot; was almost dead in the water ( in the ratings ) . &quot; The &quot; L.A. Law &quot; nominations were &quot; personally satisfying after being fired by MTM off ' Hill Street. ' &quot; As for &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; the &quot; most significant thing is that we got all_the writing nominations , and to me that is the heart and soul of the show. &quot; Some highly competitive races shaped_up in the Emmy nominations . Besides the shootout for top weekly comedy , the candidates for best drama series are &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; &quot; Northern Exposure , &quot; &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation &quot; and the quietly powerful &quot; Law &amp; Order. &quot; Competing against Roseanne for the award as best lead actress in a comedy series are Helen Hunt of &quot; Mad About You , &quot; former winner Candice Bergen of &quot; Murphy Brown , &quot; Patricia Richardson of &quot; Home Improvement &quot; and Annie Potts , the onetime &quot; Designing Women &quot; star who replaced Susan Dey in &quot; Love &amp; War &quot; last season . In yet another strong competition , the contenders for best lead actress in a miniseries or special include Midler for &quot; Gypsy , &quot; Kirstie Alley for &quot; David ' s Mother , &quot; Joanne Woodward for &quot; Breathing Lessons , &quot; Helen Mirren for &quot; Prime Suspect 3 &quot; and Jessica Tandy for &quot; To Dance With the White Dog , &quot; in which she co-starred with her husband , Hume Cronyn , another nominee . And Angela Lansbury , who has never won an acting Emmy for &quot; Murder , She Wrote &quot; since the series debuted in 1984 , will give it yet another try as a drama series nominee .
