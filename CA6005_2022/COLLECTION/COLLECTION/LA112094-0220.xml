   <TEXT> Surrounded by recumbent grips and gaffers , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are perusing a bookcase ' s worth of X-rated videos between takes_on the set of &quot; Junior. &quot; Modeled after a fertility clinic , the sprawling set , crammed onto a sound stage on the Universal lot , is rigged with an antechamber for sperm donors that the movie ' s cast and crew have dubbed the Masturbatorium and turned_into an unofficial lounge . &quot; Let ' s see , &quot; DeVito says puckishly , scanning titles such_as &quot; Triple Header &quot; and &quot; Double the Pleasure. &quot; &quot; Seen it , seen it , seen it . . . . &quot; Schwarzenegger , dressed in a pink maternity smock that bulges over a prosthetic stomach , chuckles grimly and puffs on a stubby cigar . In a moment the actors will venture down the hall to another set , where Schwarzenegger , his character &quot; pregnant &quot; with an embryo implanted in his abdomen by research partner DeVito , will explore the presumably fertile comic possibilities of a man going_into labor . But for now , there is only the desultory kibitzing that makes a day on a movie set seem like a hitch in the peacetime Army . Finally , the director is ready , and the entire surreal assemblage -- towering pink-clad former bodybuilder , riotously diminutive co-star and slumping union brethren -- disappears in a cloud of cigar smoke . There is , arguably , only one director likely to gather such unlikely characters around an equally unlikely premise . And while this director hasn ' t earned an Oscar , his films have grossed more_than $ 2 billion at the box_office and permeated the pop-cultural consciousness to_the_point that , right here on the shelves of the Masturbatorium , there ' s a porn homage to his most successful movie , evocatively dubbed &quot; Sexbusters. &quot; &quot; For some reason , I get attracted to difficult premises , &quot; Ivan Reitman says with a shrug , settling into his director ' s chair as Schwarzenegger , DeVito , co-star Emma Thompson and a gaggle of supporting actors take their places . &quot; I mean , they ' re somewhat gimmicky : Ghosts exist and you can zap them ; Arnold and Danny are twins ; a man who looks_like the President takes_over and does a better job . But I try as hard as I can to find a_level of reality in the fantastic premises that I latch onto. &quot; Tellingly , Reitman rattles_off this resume without mentioning any titles . He doesn ' t need to . You may_not have seen &quot; Ghostbusters &quot; ( 1984 ) or &quot; Twins &quot; ( 1988 ) or &quot; Dave &quot; ( 1993 ) , but their stories and characters have had an uncanny way of burrowing into the cultural topsoil , there to sprout catch phrases , ancillary toy lines , hit singles , talk-show debates . Thanks to those films , as well as &quot; Meatballs &quot; ( 1979 ) , &quot; Stripes &quot; ( 1981 ) , &quot; Kindergarten Cop &quot; ( 1990 ) and hits such_as &quot; National Lampoon ' s Animal House &quot; ( 1978 ) and &quot; Beethoven &quot; ( 1992 ) , which he produced , the 48-year-old Reitman , a Czech refugee and Canadian expatriate , enjoys a_level of discretion available to few directors . Last March , he moved his Northern Lights production company into an imposing compound on the Universal lot within hailing distance of fellow zillionaire Steven Spielberg ' s Amblin Entertainment . Rather than fret over the availability of his favorite film editor and sometime associate producer , Sheldon Kahn , he simply put him on the Northern Lights payroll . And it was Reitman who helped pioneer the practice of having stars trade huge upfront salaries for a percentage of a film ' s box-office take . &quot; I think he ' s one of the few people capable of being a really excellent movie director one day and running a studio the next , &quot; says producer Sean Daniels , who as a young Universal Pictures executive worked with Reitman developing &quot; Animal House. &quot; &quot; He understands this bizarre combination of entertainment and business. &quot; Reitman ' s financial acumen has , to his frustration , tended to obscure his filmmaker credentials . &quot; I am not confused at all about this one , &quot; producer Julia Phillips sniped about Reitman in her scorched-earth Hollywood memoir , &quot; You ' ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again. &quot; &quot; He is a businessman , not an artist. &quot; &quot; Comments like that really hurt a lot , &quot; Reitman admits . &quot; I think I am a businessman , in terms of I ' m not a fool with_regard_to how the business works . But setting all that aside , when I start on a film , from the moment I start working_on a screenplay to the last point of editing , it ' s really an intensive creative endeavor . The films I ' ve made are pretty complicated and have worked for a number of creative reasons , and I ' m very proud_of them . Since ' Twins ' and ' Dave , ' there ' s been a kind of grudging respect. &quot; That tide may be turning , even if &quot; Junior &quot; has more in common with &quot; Twins &quot; than the more cerebral &quot; Dave. &quot; &quot; I think after ' Dave ' people took him a lot more seriously , &quot; says one of Reitman ' s contemporaries . &quot; That was a huge step_forward , both creatively and as an artist. &quot; While no one would confuse &quot; Meatballs &quot; or even &quot; Dave &quot; with a Merchant Ivory production , Reitman does bring a gloss of sophistication to the sort of mainstream populist comedies that can gross upward of $ 100 million . And in a field strewn with tortured would-be auteurs , Reitman is by all accounts precise , organized and workmanlike . A former musician , he obsesses about tone , rhythm and pacing . The upshot is Reitman ' s better films click along with the sureness of a metronome . &quot; I like working with him because he has his act together , &quot; Schwarzenegger says . &quot; He ' s well prepared . He gives you the feeling : OK , he ' s not frantic , not worried , everything is mapped_out , he knows what he wants to do . that ' s a big advantage , unlike some_other directors. &quot; &quot; He ' s sharp as a needle , &quot; adds Thompson , who cut her teeth in rough-and-tumble British sketch comedies before perfecting early 20th-Century ennui in &quot; Howards End &quot; and &quot; The Remains of the Day. &quot; &quot; Comedy directing is the hardest , because you tread that line between engaging the audience with story and character , and making them laugh . It ' s a nightmare. &quot; Once known to sic packs of writers on problematic scripts -- such_as the misbegotten 1986 Robert Redford-Debra Winger vehicle &quot; Legal Eagles , &quot; Reitman ' s first attempt to appeal_to more mature sensibilities -- Reitman has tended to work closely with one or two writers on his most recent projects . On &quot; Dave , &quot; for example , Reitman used only Oscar-nominated screenwriter Gary Ross ( &quot; Big &quot; ) , who wrote the original script . &quot; I found him very sensitive to the aspirations of the material , &quot; Ross says . &quot; ' Dave ' is very difficult . You ' re trying several things at once -- a political satire with a fantastic premise that needs to be rooted in reality . ( Reitman ) was amazingly thoughtful and inclusive. &quot; Over the years Reitman has also learned to tickle , rather than bludgeon , laughs from the absurdist premises that form the backbone of most of his films . Setting the tone for &quot; Junior , &quot; Reitman says , &quot; was a very delicate thing . Because you can so easily go_into farce with this. &quot; Instead , the film ' s best moments come from juxtaposing Schwarzenegger ' s bodybuilder physique and Teutonic bearing with a feminine awareness of the physical and emotional swings of pregnancy . At one point he turns_to a smitten Thompson , who is unaware of his condition , and pleads with wide-eyed sincerity : &quot; Does my body disgust you ? &quot; But Reitman ' s satiric edge is countered by a sentimental streak , manifested in &quot; Junior &quot; with lingering , dewy close-ups of newborns and beaming parents . The combination of anarchy and treacle can be found in the director himself , who relished developing the authority-tweaking &quot; Animal House &quot; but insists that &quot; I couldn ' t make a film with despicable people. &quot; &quot; I have villains , &quot; Reitman says , &quot; but my movies have the kind of people we ' d all like to be . Go_back to any of my films -- even with a rascal like Bill Murray ( in &quot; Meatballs , &quot; &quot; Stripes &quot; and the two &quot; Ghostbusters &quot; ) -- and you know when you get right down to the bottom there ' s a good_person there with the right heart who ' s going_to do the right thing at the right time . &quot; I could never make a movie like ' Short Cuts ' or the ( Quentin ) Tarantino movies . They ' re great films but have a very black outlook on life . My outlook is the opposite . I keep looking_for that thread of decency that keeps us as humans special. &quot; Reitman pulls_off a pair of headphones and regards the tableau before him : cameras , snaking cords and literally expectant characters . To his left , Aida Turturro , James Eckhouse and Pamela Reed , who plays DeVito ' s ex-wife , hugely pregnant and slumped in a wheelchair , wait for Reitman ' s cue to enter . DeVito , Schwarzenegger and Thompson huddle behind a wall , ready to burst in from a side_entrance . The scene about to be shot is part of &quot; Junior ' s &quot; climax , and though it will last no more_than 15 seconds in the final cut , Reitman has spent much of the morning blocking the cameras and actors . &quot; This is basically a Marx Brothers scene , &quot; Reitman says , grazing from a plate of watermelon chunks . The crux of it is the discovery of the male-pregnancy experiment by DeVito ' s gynecology partner , played by Eckhouse . Reitman pulls the headphones on and stares intently at a video monitor . &quot; Action ! &quot; DeVito , Thompson and Schwarzenegger stumble onto the set ; Eckhouse and Reed , wheeled in by Turturro , enter from stage_right . &quot; What is going_on ? &quot; whines Eckhouse . &quot; Up , up , out of here , &quot; DeVito huffs , shooing Reed from the wheelchair and depositing in it the grimacing Schwarzenegger . &quot; Hurry ! &quot; bleats Thompson . Reitman hunches_forward in his chair , nodding in time to the dialogue . &quot; This is our patient , &quot; DeVito sputters at Eckhouse . &quot; What do you mean , ' patient ' -- what ' s wrong with him ? &quot; &quot; My best guess , &quot; DeVito says , &quot; is that his baby ' s tangled in the large intestine. &quot; &quot; His baby ? &quot; Eckhouse gasps , as the entourage scrabbles for the door . &quot; Oh my God . . . . &quot; &quot; Cut. &quot; Reitman pulls_off the headphones . &quot; Jim ? &quot; he addresses Eckhouse , &quot; that ' s too big. &quot; The scene rolls_out again and again , identical except for Eckhouse ' s changing the inflections of &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; God &quot; and &quot; baby. &quot; Finally : &quot; Cut . Print that . that ' s it. &quot; Reitman pulls_off his headphones and confers_with the crew . &quot; Let ' s do one more , &quot; he says , turning from the monitor . &quot; Something wonderful might happen , and I have to give us the opportunity to discover that . . . and , action . &quot; Nothing apparently more or less wonderful than the previous 11 takes reveals itself . &quot; All my focus was_on Jim and getting that moment right , &quot; Reitman explains , &quot; because that ' s where the laugh is. &quot; DeVito plunks himself into Reitman ' s chair and regards veteran director of photography Adam Greenberg . &quot; Lighting ' s good , Adam , &quot; he needles Greenberg , an Academy Award nominee ( &quot; Terminator 2 &quot; ) . &quot; You ' ve got a future , Adam. &quot; Is DeVito enjoying the filming ? &quot; Yeah , yeah , having a good time , &quot; he mutters . &quot; It ' s always a good time. &quot; What does he think_of Reitman ? &quot; He ' s a very good director. &quot; What distinguishes Reitman from the other directors that DeVito -- a director himself -- has worked with ? DeVito bristles , as if Jim Ignatowski has asked him to make change for the coffee machine on &quot; Taxi. &quot; &quot; He ' s Canadian. &quot; Born in Czechoslovakia , Reitman was barely 5 when his father and mother , an Auschwitz survivor , smuggled the family out of the country in the hold of a tugboat . They eventually settled in Toronto . &quot; I remember learning to speak ( English ) very quickly , &quot; Reitman says , though a_few Canadianisms -- he pronounces been as bean -- linger in his sentences . Reitman attended McMaster University in Hamilton , outside Toronto , around the same time as Martin Short , Dave Thomas , Eugene Levy and other young comics , some of whom would go_on to form the seminal SCTV troupe . Soon , an entire generation of Canadian talents -- among them Dan Aykroyd , John Candy and &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; producer Lorne Michaels -- would set the tone for comedy in movies and television for much of the ' 70s and ' 80s . Reitman , who would later find himself in the thick of them producing a National Lampoon stage show in New York in 1974 that would metamorphose into &quot; Animal House , &quot; instinctively grasped the withering irony of their humor . &quot; What happens with Canadians , suffering from a national inferiority_complex from the day they ' re born , is that they become great voyeurs of life -- standing back and watching . I have this sort of odd combination : the optimism of a refugee and the odd , ironic cynicism of a Canadian who is sort of commenting on things all_the time. &quot; While at McMaster , Reitman directed a comedy short , &quot; The Orientation , &quot; which was packaged with the 1969 Dustin Hoffman feature &quot; John and Mary &quot; in Canadian theaters . ( &quot; Frankly , it got way more laughs than ' John and Mary ' did , &quot; Reitman chuckles. ) Flush with the film ' s warm reception , Reitman and some college chums raised enough money to produce a feature-length film , &quot; Cannibal Girls , &quot; which Reitman directed after graduation and sold to producer Samuel Arkoff . He then produced several low-budget films for director David Cronenberg . &quot; ' Cannibal Girls ' was a mess , &quot; Reitman says . &quot; I realized I knew_nothing about directing . But in retrospect , I wish I ' d kept doing that -- I would have had three or four other films . This whole producing thing just got_in the way . I learned an awful lot , but it ' s not what ' s fun. &quot; What drove Reitman back to directing was &quot; Animal House. &quot; &quot; I had worked real hard on it , developing the script and getting John Belushi and all those people . I was hoping to be able to direct it myself , but it was very hard for the studio to go_with me . ( John ) Landis had just finished ' Kentucky Fried Movie , ' which was a big hit , and he did a wonderful job . But it was clear I was going_to get no creative credit for it , and did not , except retrospectively. &quot; Reitman could console himself somewhat because , as a producer of the film , &quot; probably individually , I made the most money from that movie of anybody . ( Landis ) was_on a small deal , and John Belushi was paid $ 60 # 000 for his part . So I got none of the credit for the movie , but I got the lion ' s share of the income . Actually , Universal got the lion ' s share . I got a decent share. &quot; Eager to direct , Reitman dragooned Hamilton buddies Dan Goldberg ( still with Reitman , he is one of &quot; Junior ' s &quot; executive producers and directed the film ' s second unit ) and writer Len Blum and , with a script polish by Harold Ramis and a reluctant Bill Murray playing the lead , started filming the summer-camp romp &quot; Meatballs &quot; two days before &quot; Animal House &quot; opened . The film was a hit , and launched Reitman ' s remarkable string of box-office success throughout the ' 80s and early ' 90s . A month after wrapping photography on &quot; Junior , &quot; Reitman and editor Sheldon Kahn sit in a darkened editing room at Northern Lights , playing and replaying a 20-second snippet of the movie on a massive console . Reitman looks exhausted . He ' s taken only one week off since shooting ended in early July , and the deadline to turn the film_over to the studio by early November to make its Thanksgiving release seems to sit leadenly on his shoulders . Still , he ' s satisfied -- perhaps a little relieved -- with an early assemblage of the footage that he screened for Northern Lights employees . &quot; It feels good . It ' s clear there ' s a movie there , and the performances are very strong . There ' s also a strong emotional kick to the movie , which is what I was really hoping for. &quot; ( It isn ' t always thus . At an early screening of &quot; Ghostbusters II , &quot; Reitman had what he calls &quot; a moment of exquisite focus &quot; when he realized the last two reels of the movie &quot; just died a horrible death . We went_out and shot 25 minutes in four days to replace everything that happened from that moment on. &quot; ) Reitman and Kahn dig_in . On Reel 9 , they grapple for an hour trying to transpose an entrance by Pamela Reed to speed_up a romantic pratfall by Schwarzenegger and Thompson at a crucial juncture in the story . &quot; This should be a huge laugh and it ' s not yet , &quot; Reitman says ruefully . &quot; I ' ve got a real problem because of the way I ' ve blocked the damn scene. &quot; Down the hall , editor Wendy Greene Bricmont is sifting through a slate of takes from Reel 12 in which Thompson fumblingly tries to comfort Reed , who has suddenly gone_into labor . ( &quot; Picture a garden , &quot; Thompson soothes in a lilting Welsh accent , &quot; with trees , and birds , cheep , cheep , cheep . . . . &quot; ) Here , the problem is more insidious . All of the takes are funny , but funny in different ways . Reitman must choose . &quot; This is what makes you crazy -- too_much wealth , and how do you spend it ? &quot; And so goes the rest of Reitman ' s summer , cocooned in the sleek silver compound financed by some of the most profitable comedies ever made . As a rule , films that gross more_than $ 100 million -- films such_as &quot; Ghostbusters &quot; and &quot; Twins &quot; -- must play to a demographically immense audience . Does Reitman , then , consciously choose projects that will somehow satisfy the entertainment cravings of everyone from sullen mall rats to doting seniors ? &quot; I ' ve been very fortunate that my films have played over the broadest spectrum of_age , &quot; Reitman says . &quot; Everybody loved ' Twins , ' ' Ghostbusters , ' even ' Dave. ' ( But ) I don ' t think_of an audience . I place myself in every moment of every scene that I do . It ' s the only gauge . &quot; I seek , &quot; declares the highest-grossing comedy director of his generation , &quot; only to please myself. &quot;</TEXT>
