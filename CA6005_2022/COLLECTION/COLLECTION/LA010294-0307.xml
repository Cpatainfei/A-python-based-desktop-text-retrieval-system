   <HEADLINE> O.C. CLIMB FROM RECESSION IS CREAKY , SLOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As 1994 dawns , Orange County is struggling out of its deepest and longest recession in 60 years . Experts say a recovery is underway , but so sluggishly it is barely noticeable . When the last big recession ended a decade ago , the county blasted into one of its strongest economic booms ever . Why the difference ? Economists tell us that we ' re in so deep because of an unparalleled confluence of events : a global recession , major defense cuts , a regional real_estate plunge , a sharp drop_in tourism and , finally , the collapse of the savings and loan industry and resulting nationwide tightening of credit . One or two of those events can trigger a recession ; all_of them happening in the same four-year period added_up to an economic catastrophe . &quot; This is definitely the worst recession since the 1930s , &quot; said Walter Hahn , an economist in the Newport Beach office of the accounting_firm Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co . &quot; But I think that Orange County has a good economic future. &quot; Even before the recession officially began in July , 1990 , Orange County was in_trouble from the decline of its real_estate development industry . In 1988 , commercial builders discovered that they had erected far more office towers than needed in the county , and by the end of 1989 residential builders learned that people no longer were willing to pay $ 350 # 000 and up for tract homes . The ripples from the real_estate crunch soon upset the equilibrium of other industries like retailing and business services . With fewer homes being sold and few offices being leased , the market for home and office_furniture , draperies , carpets , copy machines , landscape materials , even shoe repair and dry_cleaning started shrinking . The county probably could have weathered that , but when defense cutbacks started turning_into layoffs at the Southland ' s myriad aerospace and weapons factories , the die was cast . The multiple whammy of major employment losses in development , retailing , services and defense was too_much even for Orange County ' s vaunted economy to withstand . Like the previous year , 1993 ended on a dismal note . Retail sales declined for a second consecutive year , the first two-year drop since World_War_II . The increase in real_estate foreclosures , though slower than in the previous year , still is expected to grow nearly 70 % for an all-time high of 5 # 240 forced sales . And the 11 # 863 personal and business bankruptcies filed_in the county through October barely changed from the number filed_in the first 10 months of 1992 . Worst of all , the county ' s once-mighty job machine ran_out of steam . After adding an average of 38 # 000 jobs a year to their collective payrolls in the last_half of the 1980s , employers in Orange County so far have spent the ' 90s slashing an average of 22 # 000 jobs a year . Now the delicate instruments by which economists measure such things have plotted an upward trend for 1994 and beyond . The prediction , announced recently by economists at Chapman University and Cal State Fullerton , is that the economy will bounce along the bottom for the first_half of the year with a generally lackadaisical business climate until early summer . With that as a backdrop , The Times Orange County Edition invited a group of county business_executives who daily grapple with corporate decisions to share their thoughts on the local economy and business scene . The Times ' Round_Table provides a frank airing of the concerns facing county businesses . Though they represent a variety of interests and backgrounds , the panel members had several common_grounds : All have built businesses in Orange County , all say they want to stay here and each believes that the cost -- in time , money and aggravation -- of coping_with proliferating government regulation of business is at least as onerous a burden as anything the economy has thrown at them in recent years . Excerpts from the two-hour Round_Table discussion : TIMES : If you could make the rules , what is the most important thing you could do to put us back into a healthy recovery mode ? JUDEE SLACK , small-business owner : We need to get_back to free_enterprise . that ' s what our country was built_on . Business needs to be able to do what it does best rather than being made to operate as an agent for the government a lot of the time . that ' s particularly hard on small businesses . A lot of these businesses have just two or three employees and the government expects them to be specialists in human relations and taxes and accounting and a dozen other things . We also need to do something to make financing more available to help some legitimate small businesses . ROBERT MIRANDA , foreign trade specialist : To let business operate competitively and compete globally . And that will require cutting_back on this over-regulation that makes us less competitive internationally and creates obstacles to the start-up and the success of businesses . There ' s a need to take a close look_at a lot of this legislation and decide whether it ' s necessary . We have a lot of social problems that are hurting business development here , and the way to cut_back on gang problems and crime is to provide jobs for the people . TED SMITH , high-technology industry executive : I have lived_in Orange County since 1968 , and particularly in recent years I ' ve seen the environment for business deteriorate . The environment for everyone , all_of us , has deteriorated significantly . The most dramatic thing recently has been the crime problem : the number of killings in the county , especially in Santa Ana ; the gang problem , the graffiti encroachment that is a cosmetic indication of that . And I think this is_on all_of our minds . In fact , a UC Irvine survey indicated that 40 % to 50 % of the people in Orange County are afraid to go_out at night walking in their community . For the last five years in my business we have seen talented , brilliant people either thinking_about leaving or leaving the county to go_to Oregon , Washington , Texas and other places . They ' re not going because of economic problems , except maybe the cost of housing ; they ' re leaving because of the social problems . And if we don ' t get a handle on this , then it is going_to be working against us . WALTER HAHN , economist : I ' m going_to join the parade on the government regulation issue . I have this belief that all_the rules and regulations and requirements could be substantially simplified , and the cost of complying greatly reduced , without damaging the objectives that all_of this stuff is trying to achieve . But there are two other things I ' d do if I were king here in Orange County , and one of them goes_to the problem that Ted and Bob talked_about . I would improve our vocational_training programs for the majority of our children who are not going_to go_on to college . We have a real need for people who can read and write and do basic math and have training in some type of a craft . Other countries , Germany and Japan in particular , have excellent vocational_training programs , and we are sorely lacking . We need them so our kids don ' t all turn_out to be hamburger flippers ; so that they can do something much better and provide the kind of work_force that most of our growing businesses , including high-tech businesses , need . The other thing that I would do is stoke up the economic development and promotion efforts in Orange County , both as a county as_a_whole and individually for the various cities . We need to go_out and sell Orange County to the rest of the world . We need to be more competitive , and part of being more competitive is promoting ourselves . * TIMES : How will county business fare in international trade , especially under the new North_American Free_Trade Agreement ? MIRANDA : NAFTA is important for all businesses , but smaller and medium-sized businesses especially should look_at it as an opening for new markets . Mexico has more_than 85 million people and a growing , substantial middle_class that really looks_to U.S. products as quality products . I grew_up along the Mexican border and I remember as a child that the majority of the people buying goods and services in my town were coming_across the border from Mexico . There ' s always been a perception there that U.S. products have a higher_quality . So Orange County businesses should take a very close look_at the trade opportunities that NAFTA has opened_up . Beyond NAFTA , though , is a bigger mission in Latin_America . Mexico is what we were hearing about in the news , but other countries in South_America and Central_America are really looking_to NAFTA as a blueprint for a full North and South_America trading zone . And that has tremendous potential for the long-term future of Orange County . ALAN HOOPS , health_care industry executive : A lot of companies can benefit from international trade . At PacifiCare , for instance , we ' ve had inquiries from Australia , New Zealand , Belgium , Spain , Portugal , Greece and even one country in Southeast_Asia . They want us to consult with them to move their nationalized health systems to a more private system because of problems they ' re having . So it just may be that health_care could have international opportunities , even though you think_of it as being much more of a local business . * TIMES : Health_care is at the top of most people ' s lists of concerns these days . What does all_the change portend for business ? HOOPS : This is just my crystal ball on health reform , but the thing we need to remember is that the things being contemplated by the Clinton_Administration plan and other legislative proposals already are_well underway here in California . There will be some costs , and we may find that small businesses are going_to be burdened by some of the requirements , but I believe that employers here are not going_to be impacted much by what goes_on in Washington . As far as the general economy goes , in many respects I see what ' s happening throughout California as being a microcosm of what ' s happening nationally and perhaps internationally . We have been through a rather unique period of prosperity where America was relatively self-sufficient . But somewhere in the late ' 70s and ' 80s we lost that self-sufficiency and our whole country had to recognize that we were not going_to be independent of the international economy . And now I see the same thing in California . For most of the ' 80s , California was an economic juggernaut , growing every year . We were importing a lot of people and a lot of business , especially small business start-ups , and that was really keeping the state going and growing . SMITH : But now our economy is being dramatically affected by the removal of aerospace jobs , and that , together with the U.S. and global recession , has had a further impact on the real_estate market that has brought growth to Orange County . On top of that , American industry has finally figured_out that it has to be more efficient to get more competitive , so we have restructuring going_on in major corporations . It ' s practically every_other day we see 10 # 000 to 20 # 000 jobs being removed from a major corporation . Personally I applaud that because I think it really bodes well for American industry to be effective at becoming lower-cost providers . But it has its costs . I don ' t think that Orange County is going_to overcome the loss of aerospace jobs anytime soon . It ' s a long-term process to replace that many jobs with other activities . We need to recognize that while we ' re in a global recession , it is , after all , a temporary thing . We all know that we will come_out of it . * TIMES : But when , and how ? MIRANDA : In my company we really see at a micro-level what this recession is doing . From our small-business clients , we see a tendency to be not very optimistic about the prospects for 1994 . Companies are keeping themselves lean and mean , and there ' s a reluctance to add a lot of permanent staff to the payrolls . They tend to work people overtime instead . There ' s also a desire to to keep the business flexible so they are able to change rapidly in the event things don ' t turn_out as hoped for . Inventories are being maintained at very minimal levels -- just enough to keep operations going -- and there is a big concern about the availability of and access to financing . SLACK : Access to capital is a very big issue for small business . We recently did a survey of women business owners -- most of them are small businesses -- and that was a big concern . A lot of banks are saying that they make_it easy to borrow . But when you go there and go_through the red_tape , they say ' Oh ! You don ' t qualify. ' Now , a lot of the reason isn ' t necessarily the bank ' s fault . A lot of small-business owners don ' t know how to manage money or write a business plan , and that ' s something the banks are looking_for . There ' s also a lot of underground economy out there . Many small businesses keep books for tax purposes , so they don ' t want to show as much profit as they really make , and that hurts when they try to get a loan . It ' s a problem . Some of our members in the National Assn . of Women Business Owners would like to see some sort of alternative to bank financing . Even ( Small Business Administration ) loans don ' t always work because in a lot of service businesses there is very little in the way of collateral . If you don ' t own a home or have already borrowed against it , you can ' t get an SBA loan . TIMES : In light of data that shows that foreclosures in Orange County are at a record level , are we creating some sort of time-bomb ? If owners of small businesses repeatedly refinance their homes to get business capital , how many now face losing their houses because of economic hard_times ? MIRANDA : That could be a bubble that ' s beginning to burst . A lot of small businesses are being started by people who lost their jobs , and they have certainly looked_to their homes as a source of business capital . SLACK : I know I ' ve seen several of my clients lose their homes to foreclosures . I ' ve seen them refinance and refinance and turn manageable house payments into $ 2 # 000- and $ 3 # 000-a-month payments that their businesses just cannot support any more . MIRANDA : That is a real difficulty with the economy in a spin . A lot of our clients have to access financing sources like the SBA , and those kinds of loans do require a lot of collateral . And with the value of houses going_down significantly , it becomes a real tough challenge for a small-business person to go_out and obtain financing . Because small businesses traditionally provide most of the new jobs in the county as they grow , if they can ' t get financing and grow , we ' re going to see job losses as a long-term process . HAHN : Now it ' s time for some economist-speak , specifically on how deep the soup is and how we ' re going to get_out of it . This definitely is the worst recession since the 1930s . In the previous worst recession we had , in 1981 and ' 82 , the state lost about 1.5 % of its jobs . By the time this one ' s over it probably will be close to four years long instead of a year , and we ' ll lose 4.3 % of our jobs . It ' s a pretty devastating recession . And Orange County has fared a little bit worse than the state . Before we ' re finished here we ' ll lose about 65 # 000 jobs , or about 5.5 % of the employment when the recession started . My outlook is that it won ' t be until the second_half of next year that Orange County will get_back to positive job growth . And that is when the recovery starts . * TIMES : That all sounds rather bleak . HAHN : But I think that Orange County has a good economic future . First of all , the U.S. economy as_a_whole is growing at about 3 % a year . When you consider that California has about 15 % of the national economy and is in recession , that tells you that the rest of the country is doing pretty good . And we sell our goods and services throughout the United States , we don ' t export everything . So when the rest of the country is doing_well , it definitely helps our economy . International trade also is very important , particularly Pacific Rim trade , because we are the gateway to the Pacific Rim for the United States . What will help us get_out of our recession is that our trading partners are going_to recover and buy more of our things . * TIMES : How will other sectors fare ? HAHN : Another industry that is going_to help us pull_out of this is entertainment and multimedia , which , in fact , never had a recession and has continued to grow rapidly . The information highway is coming on-line , and Southern California is the world ' s capital for a lot of the programming that makes_it work . In the related telecommunications field , we have services businesses here that are going_to be spending a lot of money on capital improvements like fiber optics , and we have companies in Orange County that produce the equipment and provide a lot of services to help operate the equipment . Another thing that will help the economy is the housing_industry , which I see recovering starting in the second_half of 1994 and then going_into a fairly substantial building mode for a_couple_of years as we catch_up_with the pent-up demand for housing that has gone unsatisfied during this recession . And the last thing that ' s going_to help us grow out of this and recover is tourism . California and particularly Southern California is one of the world ' s primary tourism destinations . When the national recession hit , that slowed our tourism down because most of our visitors come from the rest of the United States . Even if Disney doesn ' t go_ahead with its expansion in Anaheim , I see solid growth happening in tourism . * TIMES : A lot of people suggest that much of the job growth we can expect is going_to be lower-skilled , lower-paid jobs . Are we losing one of our most attractive assets -- a highly skilled work_force ? SMITH : Well , I ' ve been actively involved with programs at UCI over the last few years , and it ' s been encouraging . About 90 % of the graduates stay in Orange County , and that flow of intellect and skill and energy is a tremendous asset . HOOPS : It ' s not really a matter of less-skilled jobs . With the reduced importance of the defense and aerospace businesses here , perhaps we ' re seeing the final cleansing of the one-company career track . It may be that people are all going_to have multiple careers and will have to develop a number of skills . HAHN : I absolutely do not see Orange County being hollowed_out and losing all_of its well-paid jobs . I think it ' s going_to continue to be pretty balanced . In fact , in the past 10 or 15 years we ' ve lost a lot of our lower-paid jobs . The companies that moved here in the 1950s and ' 60s because everything was so cheap have moved again , out of state or to the Inland Empire , because now Orange County is expensive and they can ' t afford to be here . While we certainly have added some lower-paid jobs in the ' 80s , we also added a lot of jobs in industries like Ted Smith ' s , in telecommunications and biomedical research , and we didn ' t lose them all_in the recession . HOOPS : I think that the recovery is going_to be a steady one , but probably not a robust one . But the result will be a more resilient economy . Not being able to rely as much on real_estate and aerospace means we will have to have a much more sound foundation of smaller employers who perhaps will be more able to deal quickly with economic trends and opportunities . we ' ll have a different economic profile , but there is reason for optimism .
