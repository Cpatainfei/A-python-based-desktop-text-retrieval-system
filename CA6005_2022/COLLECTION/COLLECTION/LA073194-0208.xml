   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : THERE WILL BE LITTLE JOY LEFT IN MUDVILLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I never saw a strike that was &quot; won. &quot; Not in the short run . Oh , don ' t get me wrong . I ' m no advocate of big business . I grew_up in a household where my grandfather worked 14 hours a day . If he got hurt on_the_job -- as he often did -- that was his tough luck . They not only didn ' t pay his medical_expenses , they didn ' t even pay his salary while he was off the job . I ' m guessing that was about $ 15 a week . Management took the position the injury was his own damn carelessness . No concern of theirs . Costly strikes elsewhere helped to change that sorry state of things . But so did indignant doctors and enterprising lawyers . If a Royal Typewriter strike garnered a $ 2-an-hour raise , the price of typewriters went_up 50 bucks . So did the services of those who had to buy them . Newspapers went from 3 cents a copy to 10 cents . Reporters went clear_up to $ 25 a week . Which brings me to the baseball strike that is imminent . For the first time in history , the World_Series is in danger of being wiped_out . Not even world_wars could wipe_out World_Series . But a union might do_it . With a lot of help from management . I don ' t think either unionist Don Fehr or ownership ' s Richard Ravitch wants to be known as &quot; the creature that killed baseball. &quot; Ravitch maintains that he ' s trying to save it . Fehr ' s view is narrower . He ' s trying to save the union rank_and_file their multimillion-dollar lifestyles . If it comes_to pass , it will be the first strike in history where the strikers had more money than the bosses . In the whole history of labor warfare , this has never happened anywhere but baseball . The issues are clear : Ownership wants a salary cap , i.e , a fixed ceiling on the amount_of_money they will pay the help each year . The union scoffs at this . Understandably . Why play for table stakes when you have all_the aces ? Baseball says nine or more of its teams are losing money . Then , someone goes_out and pays $ 173 million for the Baltimore_Orioles . The Baltimore_Orioles ! The team that used to be the St . Louis Browns -- a team that drew fewer fans in a decade than the New York Yankees drew_in a big week . Why plead poormouth when southern cities are so salivating for franchises that they build stadiums in the hopes they can lure a team and will pay almost anything to get one ? How can you plead poormouth when the game could charge Miami and Denver $ 95 million merely for the license to do business ? Batteries ( ballplayers ) not included . Baseball insists it has to have a salary cap to institute revenue sharing . Now , revenue sharing is obviously a priority . The Yankees ' local radio-TV contracts , the real lifeblood of a franchise , were for about $ 54 million . The Seattle Mariners ' were for about $ 3 million . Pittsburgh had to trade -- or simply lose -- Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla and Doug Drabek . that ' s half a pennant right there . The San Diego Padres had to scatter Fred McGriff , Gary Sheffield , Tony Fernandez , Bruce Hurst , Randy Myers and Benito Santiago . Couldn ' t afford them . Clearly , small-market teams are overmatched in the counting house . And , therefore , on the playing_field . It has to be leveled . Not everyone can move to Tampa-St . Pete . If the Dodgers take_in $ 80 million more in TV revenue than , say , San Diego , the game has a problem . that ' s San Diego ' s problem , the players say . Well , not exactly . The essence of sport is competition , not exhibition . A Dream Team giving a recital only works every decade or so . If you can ' t compete at the bank , you can ' t compete on the bases . How many of the advantages of today ' s players are ascribable to work_stoppages ? Well , the costliest one in baseball history , 1981 , started_out with management having a strike fund with Lloyd ' s of London that paid each club $ 100 # 000 per lost game . The policy didn ' t go_into effect until the second week and topped out at 500 games . The strike lasted 712 games . The owners lost $ 72 million -- offset by Lloyd ' s $ 44 million -- but the players lost $ 28 million . Home mortgages , alimonies , autos , club dues , maids , butlers , yard work , phone_calls and the yacht go_on whether baseball does or doesn ' t . Setting a strike date is like dropping leaflets over an open city . It gives the enemy , i.e. , the owners , time to break_out the white_flag . What if they don ' t ? What if the game takes this called third strike with its bat on its shoulder ? Well , the economic ruin would be devastating . It has been estimated that it would cost Barry Bonds more_than $ 25 # 000 a day . Or more_than $ 1.3 million if the rest of the season is wiped_out . It would cost baseball $ 140 million if the postseason were wiped_out . What if baseball itself is wiped_out ? What if fan disgust finally boils_over ? What if they gave a ball_game and nobody showed_up ? Not likely . They will show_up , all_right . The day after the ' 81 strike ended , 60 # 000 fans showed_up in Philadelphia to see Cincinnati ' s Pete Rose go_for his 3 # 631st all-time National League-leading hit . Baseball fans don ' t have to buy tickets , they have the remote_control in their hands . They have the veto power . They simply won ' t exercise it . It ' s hard to argue with the gains posted . Fehr , as did Marvin Miller before him , likes to behave as if he is representing the girls in the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire , but the ante has gone steadily up for these hired hands who not only don ' t make shirts in a sweatshop but who are probably the most visible bunch of underachievers in the labor_force . They fail at what they do two out of every three times . They sign $ 43-million contracts , with a $ 10-million signing bonus -- then they go_out and sell their autographs . In many cases , they refuse to help promote the game that makes them all this money . The gains they have made are hardly made on the picket_line . Free_agency came_about mainly because owner Charlie Finley neglected to put part of pitcher Catfish Hunter ' s salary in an insurance fund and a three-man arbitration committee declared him a free_agent . A permanent arbitrator -- which was to turn_out to be the owners ' Little Big Horn -- was put_in place by the owners themselves , by a vote of 22-2 . Salaries , of course , escalated . But that was_due not so_much to labor activity as_to the presence of a new and well-heeled player in the game , television . At one point , television was paying $ 14 million a year to each club . It was a major reason baseball ' s average salary went from $ 35 # 000 a year in 1975 to $ 326 # 000 by 1984 to more_than $ 1 million today , with nearly 200 players making more_than $ 2 million a year . But baseball_teams play 162 games a year compared with 82 for basketball_teams and 16 for football_teams . A baseball_game is hardly the event the others are -- as CBS was to discover to its sorrow . CBS paid $ 1.06 billion for the grand old game -- and lost its shirt . Today , baseball merely takes its cut of TV revenue with the networks . In short , it only gets what it earns , based on how it performs . Too_bad the players can ' t do the same . When last seen , baseball was paying about $ 50 million to players who were no longer performing at all -- and at least one team , the Dodgers , were paying millions to a player ( see Darryl Strawberry ) who was performing for another team and beating their brains out . It ' s not a game anymore . It ' s an industry . It ' s barnacled with agents , accountants , superstations , licensing_fees , strikes , lockouts , corked bats and card shows . It ' s run_by and for millionaires . It ' s not &quot; Casey at the Bat &quot; anymore , it ' s Casey at the Bank . When I think_of Grandpa crawling around those belt lines at Pratt &amp; Whitney for 54 years , I could cry . Strike Losses Players who would lose the most in salary during each day of a strike , with 1994 salary , daily loss and total loss if the strike lasts from Aug . 12 through the rest of the season . Salaries listed do not include prorated shares of signing bonuses or other guaranteed income , or incentive bonuses earned or money lost because of lost opportunities for incentive bonuses . Daily loss is calculated by dividing 1994 salary by 183 , the number of days scheduled for the 1994 season . The method was established in a 1983 decision by arbitrator Raymond Goetz dealing with salaries during the 1981 strike . 05 # 05 , 28 # 12 , 09 # 12 52-Day No . Player , Team Salary Daily Total 1 .
