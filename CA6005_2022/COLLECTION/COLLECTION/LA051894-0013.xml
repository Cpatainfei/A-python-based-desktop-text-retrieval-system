   <HEADLINE> INFLATION FEARS ? HEED TOKYO ' S EXPERIENCE ; INTEREST_RATES : THE U.S. CAN TAKE LESSONS FROM THE DISASTER THAT FOLLOWED JAPAN ' S RATE HIKES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s two recent nominees to the seven-member Federal_Reserve_Board should add weight to arguments against further interest-rate increases . Their confirmation by the Senate is urgent , given that the Fed has again taken action to raise interest_rates . The Fed ' s measures could dampen the recovery that we have seen recently in California and return the state to the economic doldrums of the past few years . The impact of monetary policies is brutally evident in the Japanese recession that has now entered its fourth year , having shaken a once-booming economy to the core . It is a recession exacerbated by mistakes in economic_policy at the hands of the Bank_of_Japan -- Tokyo ' s counterpart to the Federal_Reserve_System . The name of the Bank_of_Japan ' s governor is Mieno , which literally means &quot; threefold &quot; in Japanese . There is irony in the name , for Mieno actually made three major errors in his handling of monetary policy . First , having experienced the runaway inflation of the early to mid-1970s , when consumer price increases at their peak reached 30 % per year in Japan , Mieno was obsessed by the prospect that inflation might rekindle . Although high inflation was not imminent , he raised the discount_rate sharply after taking_office in late 1989 . That key rate rose by almost 2 percentage_points within a_few months in 1990 . Mieno kept interest_rates at high levels until mid-1991 , when the economy had already fallen_into a recessionary spiral . Mieno , for his second error , did not recognize the importance of the stock_market to the overall economy , and ignored the warning sounded by the collapse of the Tokyo stock_market in 1990 . He even regarded these market declines as a desirable correction from the so-called &quot; bubble economy &quot; of the 1980s . And finally , Mieno apparently believed that unlike other advanced economies , Japan ' s economic health was so robust that his high interest policy could not substantially retard the growth of the real economy . He never expected that a tight monetary policy would lead Japan to the worst recession in the postwar era . Although Mieno came_to realize in 1992 that his fight against inflation was stifling Japan ' s economy , he was reluctant to cut the discount_rate for fear of being accused of reversing his stand against speculation in the securities and real-estate markets . As a result of his tight-money policies , the Japanese economy is still suffering from major declines in asset values and from very high &quot; real &quot; interest_rates . Even though the nominal interest_rates may appear low , the current Japanese deflation rate is about 2 % a year on the wholesale level . The &quot; real &quot; rates are therefore about 2 % above the percentage actually charged . Mieno ' s mistakes have taken their toll , and Japan has had near-zero growth for some time . While U.S. conditions are not the same , there are enough comparisons to cause concern . Rapid interest-rate hikes by the Federal_Reserve have spooked the financial markets and triggered substantial declines . Perhaps they would have occurred anyway , but that is surely no reason for the Fed to lead the charge . The national economy is poised for a major recovery . But this expansion can quickly be halted by a dose of monetary restraint . With the example of the Japanese recession in mind , President Clinton ' s new appointees , White_House economic adviser and Princeton professor Alan Blinder and UC Berkeley economist Janet Yellen , would do_well to curb the Fed ' s excessive fears of inflation . California is still poised for recovery -- if only the Fed can restrain its own hand .</TEXT>
