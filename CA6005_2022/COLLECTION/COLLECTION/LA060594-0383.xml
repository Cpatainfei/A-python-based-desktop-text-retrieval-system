   <HEADLINE> VILLA TERMINI ; TERMITES ARE TREATED TO DINNER ' ON THE HOUSE ' AS PART OF UC BERKELEY STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE EXTERMINATION METHODS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ah , these Californians . First they take some prime real_estate in the San Francisco Bay area . Then they build a custom home . And then they give it to . . . termites ? Well , the house wasn ' t exactly a gift . It was part of a scientific experiment on the UC Berkeley campus . The termites were placed in the house in waves , and each wave was attacked by a different method of extermination -- heat , cold , electric_shock , microwave , fumigants -- to see which works best . The researchers dubbed the house &quot; Villa Termiti. &quot; Cute idea , and a real media draw . When the first body_counts were announced two months ago by the co-investigators at Berkeley and the U.S. Forest Service , reporters rushed to the battlefield -- even CNN , as everyone involved likes to point_out . The war was such fun , the conclusions were almost buried . The data proved that nontoxic &quot; alternative &quot; methods can kill drywood termites . But it also showed that for a real no-survivors , no-escape victory , nothing beats , or even equals , whole-house fumigation . After the media blitz , California homeowners swamped Berkeley ' s extension office with requests for more information on the experiment . &quot; I love my work but given the demands and the lack of resources , the attention has gotten_to be a drag , &quot; said entomologist Vernard Lewis , Ph.D. , one of the principal_investigators . The interest is understandable . Drywood termites are a big problem in California . Each year , Californians spend an estimated $ 300 million to $ 400 million to fight termites , most of it on drywood rather than subterranean termites . The study was undertaken , Lewis said , to try to answer the questions of both consumers and the industry about the effectiveness of alternative termite treatment methods as well as traditional fumigation techniques . Vendors of alternative methods have been marketing nontoxic treatments -- freezing termites right in the walls with liquid_nitrogen , roasting them , zapping them with &quot; Electro-Guns. &quot; These are appealing because they seem environmentally benign , impressively high-tech and there ' s no telltale Baggie over the house advertising the presence of termites and the absence of occupants . But do the alternatives really work ? The consumer can ' t tell . The only visible evidence of live termites is little piles of droppings ; there ' s no evidence of termite death . The study of alternative methods includes projects at both UC Berkeley and UC Riverside . It is funded by grants from the state ' s Structural Pest Control_Board and donations from the pest control industry . &quot; Pest control operators need to have as_many tools available to them as possible , because people may have a real or perceived objection to pesticides , &quot; said Harvey Logan , executive_vice_president of the Sacramento-based Pest Control Operators of California . &quot; We hoped the study would show alternative methods safe and effective , that they worked. &quot; Villa Termiti , built at Berkeley ' s Forest Products Lab , is really only a 20-by-20 foot room ( the size of a two-car garage ) finished in gray stucco with a green shingle gabled roof . The villa has four identical sides , each with a door and windows , and an attic and crawl space . It has no insulation , no pipes , no heat and the main room is just drywall over framing . ( The drywall has already had to be replaced three times over the months of testing. ) The house was ready for occupancy last August , but the termites weren ' t just ushered_in and allowed to choose their own rooms . They were hand-placed in Douglas fir boards that were divided into three &quot; galleries &quot; with 25 termites in each gallery , for a total of 75 termites per board . Then , Lewis said , the boards &quot; were randomly placed in the villa . The studs were exposed , the boards were affixed to the studs and the drywall was put back. &quot; The villa was treated 11 times with six drywood termite eradication methods -- two fumigants , heat , liquid_nitrogen , microwave and electrogun . Pest control operators specializing in each method performed the treatment , with the exception of the liquid_nitrogen method , which researchers applied because Tallon Termite &amp; Pest Control , whose Blizzard System advertises that &quot; We freeze their little buns off , &quot; refused to participate in the study . Four of the six methods were full-house treatments , involving 48 boards ( and 3 # 600 termites ) -- 12 in the attic , 24 behind the drywall , 12 in the sub-area . The microwave people couldn ' t do the sub-area , and the liquid_nitrogen was put only into the walls . In all cases , the boards were pulled_out and the survivors counted within a_couple_of days and carefully put aside , Lewis said , because &quot; if you leave them too long , the ants find them. &quot; The results : -- Sulfuryl fluoride ( &quot; Vikane &quot; ) , a fumigant gas injected into the tarp-wrapped villa : No termites survived , no damage to structure . -- Synergized methyl_bromide ( &quot; MAKR &quot; ) , a fumigant gas cut by carbon_dioxide and injected into the tarp-wrapped villa : No termites survived , no damage to structure . -- Heat , in which propane heaters in the tarp-wrapped villa raised the internal temperature of the wood to 120 degrees ( and the room air to 187 degrees ) : About 35 , or 1 % of the 3 # 600 termites survived , those closest to the concrete foundation . Minor warping of some boards . -- Liquid_nitrogen ( 292 degrees below zero ) , sprayed into the wall voids_of the villa ' s main room : No termites survived . Minor warping of drywall panels . Holes drilled into the drywall for the procedure required repair . -- Microwave , over 500 watts , administered through a funneled device the size of a toaster oven set_on a tripod close to the wall . Almost 8 % of termites survived . Some boards severely burned . -- Electric_shock , administered by electrogun through pinholes drilled_in the drywall : About 50 % of the termites survived , but another 30 % expired over the next several weeks . Pinholes in the drywall required repair . &quot; The bottom_line is obviously that ( all methods ) kill insects , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; But if you ' re looking_for 100 % , some fall_short , and in the field , they probably fall_shorter yet . If you want 100 % , you ' re in the chemical area. &quot; Spot treatment might be good_enough , but only if all_the spots of infestation are located , which can be difficult . The UC researchers used acoustic detection equipment not yet commercially available to pick_up signals that humans can ' t hear -- in this case , the sound of wood fibers being torn by tiny mandibles . &quot; If the industry had the tools I have , maybe they could use spot techniques , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; And still , if I picked_up termites in three or four different areas of a house , I ' d fumigate. &quot; At least , he added , &quot; I now have data that says : first , if you treat for termites , treatment methods are not always 100 % , but second , even with the Electro-Gun , 80 % are killed . Given all that , someone ( who is ) chemical-phobic could make a decision. &quot; The industry reaction to the news from Villa Termiti was mixed . Jay Tallon , owner of Tallon Termite , although &quot; tickled pink by the conclusions , &quot; criticizes both procedure and results . &quot; These people didn ' t have the foggiest notion of how much ( nitrogen ) to use , &quot; he said , having refused to give them the information . And he thinks the conclusion bears_out his suspicion that the purpose was &quot; to come_out and ( show ) fumigation still the best way to go. &quot; The Pest Control Operators ' announcement of the results ( &quot; Some Non-Chemical Termite Treatments May Fall_Short in Their Claims , Study Finds &quot; ) seems to support his assertion . But , Logan said , it was &quot; intended to be realistic , not negative. &quot; The association considers the study &quot; somewhat encouraging , &quot; but &quot; basically a laboratory experiment , using more of the ( alternative ) product than what ' s used in the field. &quot; But there is support in the industry for the nontoxic techniques . &quot; The industry would accept the fact that all alternative methods are effective spot treatments , &quot; said Carl Doucette , vice_president of American City Pest Control in Lawndale and an industry member of California ' s Structural Pest Control_Board . &quot; The problem is they guarantee the whole house. &quot; So far , there aren ' t many vendors using alternative methods . While Villa Termiti was being alternately infested and attacked , researchers at UC Riverside examined 20 # 000 termite inspection reports filed_in three Southern California counties . They found that nontoxic alternatives were used in fewer than 10 % of termite control jobs . Most consumers stick_to conventional methods -- either spot treatments with chemicals or whole-house fumigation . The Villa Termiti study isn ' t definitive , but it ' s a first and a useful step , the researchers said . The public response to it certainly proves that the question of drywood termite treatments in_general and alternative methods in particular is of wide interest . Further study is needed , Lewis said , with more resources and more manpower , so he and his fellow entomologists can get_off the phones and back to work .</TEXT>
