   <HEADLINE> TAKING_AIM AT THE BAD ADS ; GROUP SAYS FINE PRINT BELIES WHAT PRODUCTS TOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tiny print carrying the bad news in ads -- virtually hidden at the bottom of the TV screen or page -- was a favorite marketing ploy used by many of the nation ' s top advertisers last year . That is the conclusion of the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest , which handed_out its ninth annual &quot; Lemon Awards &quot; on Thursday for &quot; Worst Ads of 1993. &quot; The group said ads carrying tiny print ranked among the most misleading and irresponsible of the year . Bold promises in many of the cited ads were often contradicted by their small print , the center said . Among the biggest culprits , it said , were American Honda , Northwest Airlines and Hasbro . &quot; Small print cannot justify an otherwise misleading claim , &quot; said Bruce Silverglade , legal director of the center . &quot; The only way to read the small print in most TV spots is to videotape it , freeze-frame it and look_at it with a magnifying glass. &quot; The center ' s bad ad awards are a public relations nightmare for most companies , which frequently face days of embarrassment following the citations . The privately funded center , started on a shoestring in 1971 , has amassed considerable political power over the years , helped in part by the publicity from its Lemon Awards . But the center itself is also the subject of criticism . Some have accused the group of trying to garner publicity -- as well as donations -- by hosting this ad-bashing ceremony each year . Center executives say the best way to keep a close watch on advertisers would be to name a consumer advocate to fill a soon-to-open commissioner ' s post on the Federal Trade Commission . But those interests might appear to be somewhat self-serving , because group co-founder Michael Jacobson has previously stated an interest in that post . Executives at the center insist that they are only looking_out for what ' s best for consumers . And at Thursday ' s ceremony in Washington , officials said that too many consumers are being misled by new forms of deceptive advertising . For help in selecting the worst offenders , the center sought the aid of several consumer groups that specialize in specific areas . Officials at the center were particularly irked by a Honda car lease spot that they say seduces viewers with a promise that it is &quot; designed to improve cash flow. &quot; While the ad promises payments of $ 199 a month , the small print notes charges that add_up to much more . &quot; Instead of ' designed to improve cash flow , ' the slogan for the lease ads should be ' designed to obscure the true cost , ' &quot; said Debra Barclay , communications director for the Center for Auto Safety , a consumer group that selected the Honda ad as the most offensive . Honda denies that the commercial is misleading . &quot; Obviously , no one is going_to lease a car based on a single TV spot , &quot; spokesman Mike Spencer said . &quot; The ad meets all legal , ethical and moral requirements. &quot; Only the tiniest print in an ad for Northwest Airlines revealed that the promised &quot; incredible vacation fares &quot; -- which appeared to be offered over a three-month period -- were actually available for just 15 days . &quot; The ' incredible vacation fares ' are so incredible that for most would-be travelers , they don ' t exist , &quot; said Geraldine Frankoski , director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project , a Washington-based group affiliated with consumer activist Ralph Nader , which selected the offending ad . Northwest insists that it wasn ' t loose with the facts . &quot; We don ' t feel that is misleading , &quot; spokesman Jim Faulkner said . The center said an ad by toy maker Hasbro is especially misleading because it targets a vulnerable group -- children . The TV commercial depicts toy cowboys in a snazzy Western town -- but the toy town is not for_sale . &quot; The toy is targeted to children who are too young to read , &quot; pointed_out Bill Wood , consumer advocate for U.S. Public Interest Research Group , which selected the ad . For its part , Hasbro says the TV spot is perfectly clear . The toy is sold via a toll-free phone_number . And the company has only received two calls from consumers who think the toy Western town is for_sale , said Wayne Charness , vice_president at Hasbro . Aside from too_much small print , the center found lots of other misleading statements in ads over the past year . Two of its biggest industry culprits were makers of alcoholic_beverages and tobacco products . It was harshly critical of a print ad for Kool cigarettes that features an attractive woman in high heels next to the headline &quot; Totally Kool. &quot; Center officials said the ad implies that smoking can somehow add_to sexual attraction . But a spokesman for Brown &amp; Williamson , maker of Kool cigarettes , said the ad &quot; conforms_to the code in every way. &quot; The center also accused brewer Anheuser-Busch of violating the beer industry ' s own code that prohibits ads showing beer being consumed illegally . In an ad for its Bud Light brand , a man is shown riding in the back of a limousine while holding an open bottle of Bud Light . But having an open container in a moving vehicle is illegal in some states . &quot; It is ridiculous to over-analyze what is meant to be humorous , &quot; said Francine Katz , director of consumer awareness at Anheuser-Busch . ' Worst Ads ' of 1993 This list of &quot; the most misleading , unfair and irresponsible &quot; advertising of 1993 was compiled by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a Washington-based consumer organization .
