   <HEADLINE> CHINESE BREAK LAW TO SEE POPULAR CORRUPTION SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Corruption and crime are such hot_issues in China these days that people are willing to break the law to see them . Tickets for the Beijing Anti-Corruption and Bribery Exhibition , for example , sold_out soon after the show opened last week , according to its official sponsor , the special state prosecutor ' s office . In some cases , factories or government_departments purchased tickets for their entire work_forces . But ticketless folks had no problem getting_into the crime show on a recent morning . Illegal scalpers were plentiful outside the museum , selling entries for six times the original price ( about 30 cents ) . The exhibit , at the Chinese People ' s Military Museum , is closed to foreigners because of the negative picture it presents of officialdom . But the prosecutor ' s office claims that more_than 20 # 000 citizens come daily to the museum to see case_histories and photographs of corrupt officials and white-collar criminals . Uniformed guides provide commentary . In front of the photograph of one convicted official , said a man who attended the exhibition , the guide reports that the wrongdoer ' s jet-black hair &quot; turned snow-white as soon as he was arrested. &quot; Another display features photographs of the handsome white-collar criminal Wang Feng , including one in which he is sipping brandy while surrounded by adoring and beautiful women . According to the case_history , Wang once spent 1 million yuan -- the equivalent of $ 120 # 000 -- on a single night ' s entertainment in a karaoke bar . Wang , manager of a government-owned trading firm , was convicted in 1993 of obtaining 21 illegal bank loans totaling $ 60 million and using them for private pleasures . When police arrested Wang and his cohorts , they had only $ 4 million left . Such details stunned some of the visitors to the exhibit . &quot; I was shocked by the amount_of_money , &quot; said a young bookkeeper from Hubei province who attended the show with her fiance , an air_force enlisted man on_leave from Inner Mongolia . Others may have been attracted by the accounts of corruption and high living . The Chinese capital , it seems , has an insatiable appetite for crime news . Crime reporting in daily newspapers has increased noticeably . Recent stories in Beijing have detailed police shootouts with armed hoods , a crackdown on railroad-ticket counterfeiters and a vice raid on prostitutes in a luxury hotel . One of the most popular shows on television since it began airing in April is &quot; Broadcast Focus &quot; -- a prime-time investigative news_show that reports on such subjects as child_abuse in public day-care centers , battered women , restaurant hygiene and public corruption . In the restaurant episode , reporters proved that a local eatery was reusing disposable wooden chopsticks by gluing them together to make them look new . In the child-abuse segment , the reporters exposed a provincial day-care worker who punished a 3-year-old girl for bed-wetting by beating her and burning her with cigarettes . But the most popular broadcasts , according to producer Sun Yusheng , are those on official corruption . &quot; Corruption is the hot topic these days , &quot; Sun said in a telephone_interview . One of his most recent shows focused , in fact , on the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Exhibition at the Military Museum . The exhibition was set_up by the special prosecutor to demonstrate the government ' s firm resolve in combatting the corruption and white-collar crime sweeping China . Even senior Chinese officials admit that corruption has become rampant since senior leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing the economy in the early 1980s . The official explanation is that corruption is an unpleasant side_effect of a market_economy . But with 90-year-old Deng ailing , many senior officials fear that the corruption issue could turn against them in the succession battle that will inevitably follow his death . The impression that senior public officials are considered beyond the law is deeply rooted here . A recent public_debate over stringent new laws governing dog ownership in Beijing , for example , included a demand from one resident that the new rules also apply to &quot; high-ranking officials living_in independent compounds , so that it will not ruin their reputation in the minds of ordinary citizens. &quot; According to the official program sold at the door of the exhibition , the Beijing special prosecutor ' s office has handled 2 # 143 cases of corruption since 1990 . The cases have involved 41 senior officials , including two vice ministers . Not everyone at the exhibition was convinced that the prosecutor had netted all_the bad_guys . One government employee who attended the show eavesdropped on two elderly men , both former bureaucrats , as they walked through the displays . &quot; It ' s not very big , &quot; said the first . &quot; No , &quot; agreed his friend . &quot; Most of the bigger crooks are still hidden. &quot; &quot; What about you ? &quot; said the first man . &quot; I ' m not hidden , &quot; replied the friend . &quot; I ' m retired. &quot;</TEXT>
