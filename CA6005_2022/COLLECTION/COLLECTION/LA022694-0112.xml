   <HEADLINE> OIL CLEANUP MAY END BY NEXT WEEK ; SPILL : COST OF SANTA CLARA RIVER PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO TOP $ 1 MILLION . A NINTH BREAK IN PIPELINE LEAKS 168 GALLONS BUT IT ' S NOT NEAR THE WATERWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cleanup of a major oil spill that blackened miles of the Santa Clara River after last month ' s earthquake is expected to be completed by early next week , state_Department of Fish and Game officials said Friday . More_than 190 # 000 gallons of crude_oil spilled from a pipeline rupture that was triggered by the Jan . 17 quake . The leak killed 693 fish , birds , amphibians and other wildlife and created a black gooey mess that stretched 17 miles from Santa Clarita to just east of Piru . Fish and Game officials and cleanup crews hired by Atlantic Richfield Co. , parent company of the Four-Corners Pipeline , expect to finish their cleanup efforts this weekend . &quot; We expect to have complete sign-off on the project Monday or Tuesday , &quot; said Arco spokesman Scott Loll . Arco has not yet determined the cost to clean_up the spill but hoped to have preliminary figures by Monday , Loll said . However , Fish and Game officials estimate the cost will be_well over $ 1 million . A ninth break_in the pipeline was discovered during a test of the line Thursday , Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese said . The rupture , which Reese said was not near the river , leaked 168 gallons of oil . &quot; It ' s an old pipeline , it was constructed in 1925-26 , &quot; Reese said . &quot; It ' s not the only pipeline in the area , and it ' s not the only one where we ' ve had breaks . The pipeline runs from production areas to refineries , whatever is in between is at risk. &quot; With the majority of the thick black crud already vacuumed from the river , crews are trying to remove any remaining pockets of oil floating on the surface or trapped in the soil , officials said . &quot; At this point we ' re digging_up sediments ; there ' s very little free oil left , &quot; said Bob Schlichting , a Fish and Game spokesman . He said 193 # 494 gallons of oil were spilled as a result of the broken pipeline . &quot; Of that , we are saying we ' ve recovered 64 # 638 gallons , &quot; Schlichting said . &quot; The rest either evaporated or sunk into sediments or is wrapped_up in trees. &quot; In one section of the river that was still being cleaned , crews wearing yellow plastic suits stood thigh-deep in the water Friday , wiping the surface with rags in an attempt to capture any remaining oil . While the river appears normal , Fish and Game officials cautioned that oil trapped in vegetation or soil can still be dangerous to wildlife . &quot; Obviously when you have a spill like this there is damage . We will do what we can to be sure the area recovers , &quot; Reese said . &quot; A lot of it depends_on how well you can clean_up the oil. &quot; * Fish and Game supervisors divided the river into eight sections after the spill to manage the cleanup efforts . So far , four sections have been cleaned and officials anticipate completing the other four by early next week . &quot; It doesn ' t guarantee that all_the oil is removed , &quot; Reese said . Reese said the department is planning a study to assess the effects on wildlife in the area . He said the study will take two to three years to complete . Officials said they will carefully monitor an endangered bird known as the least Bell ' s vireo during the next few months . Although the migratory birds had not returned from their winter habitat in the south when the spill occurred , they are expected to arrive_at their nesting grounds along the Santa Clara River in March . Wildlife experts fear the spill could contaminate the birds ' food supplies . &quot; We always have concerns about them because they ' re endangered , &quot; Reese said . &quot; We don ' t expect the spill to eliminate the vireos , but that could happen. &quot; In addition to its assessment , the Department of Fish and Game will produce an investigation report that will be submitted to the Los Angeles district_attorney ' s office . The pipeline broke_in Santa Clarita , which is in Los Angeles County . Reese did not know when the report would be completed . * Schlichting said it is possible Arco could face legal charges because of the spill , but that could be four or five months away . Arco ' s Loll said the company has not been notified of any lawsuit and doesn ' t anticipate one . &quot; We feel the pipeline was_well maintained , &quot; Loll said . &quot; We feel this was the result of the earthquake . We don ' t subscribe_to the arguments we ' ve heard. &quot; Environmentalists have blamed the spill on the pipeline ' s age and a lack of a maintenance . Loll said all eight breaks_in the Four-Corners Pipeline have been repaired , and Arco hopes the line will be back in_operation by the end of March . The pipeline moves oil from the San Joaquin Valley to the Los Angeles Basin , Loll said . It carries an estimated 50 # 000 barrels a day .</TEXT>
