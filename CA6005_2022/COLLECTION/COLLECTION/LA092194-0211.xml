   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT BESET BY WOES , ON WANE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With prominent groups like the Sierra Club , Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society facing sharp declines in membership and revenue as well as waning political influence , the environmental movement is struggling to recapture the momentum that made_it one of the strongest_forces in the nation over the past quarter of a century . Few in the movement agree on a strategy for resuscitation . As they grope_for solutions , some fear that their cause may have become so_much a part of the American mainstream that many people no longer believe that it merits special attention . The outlook is gloomy despite some smaller success stories . Several regional groups who have built nationwide constituencies on behalf of specific forests or canyons continue to hold their own . And at least one innovative national organization has grown as it looks_for ways to curb pollution that minimize costs and regulations . But at a time when the movement was expected to prosper -- just two years after the election of its first White_House ally in more_than a decade -- most major organizations are groping_for a vision that will replenish revenue , reunify members and inspire the public . A deficit of several million dollars has put the Sierra Club , the nation ' s oldest environmental organization , in its worst financial shape in 20 years , said Carl Pope , the club ' s executive_director . &quot; We are trying to do all we can , and that will mean some cutting_back , some restructuring , to avoid a crisis , &quot; Pope said . In Orange County , the Sierra Club ' s paid membership has dropped to 8 # 300 members from about 10 # 000 three years ago , said local Chairman Diana Berry . Turnout at meetings and at campaigns such_as saving Laguna Canyon remains the same , she said , but contributions are not . &quot; People are still around . They just are not supporting us financially as they had been . People are just as concerned as they always have been about environmental issues . It is just that they feel they have more personally pressing financial concerns. &quot; Officials of Greenpeace , a group that got its start in the early 1970s trying to block nuclear_weapons tests , say membership is down nearly 1 million from its 1990 high of 2.5 million , and its revenues are off by a third . A 30 % decline in membership during the same period has forced the Wilderness Society to close offices and lay off employees . At the same time that many of these groups are hobbled by layoffs and reduced budgets , they are trying to rebound from a dismal performance in Washington . Up against well-organized opponents , the environmental movement has not been able to pass a single piece of major legislation in 1994 . Hostile forces in Congress have succeeded in bottling_up bills that would grant Cabinet status to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , strengthen the Clean Water Act , the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Endangered Species Act and put more teeth in mining regulations . The pain of downsizing is aggravated by fierce infighting within the movement over the cause of its problems . Fund-raisers cite the recession and the public ' s preoccupation with crime and financial security . Roger Craver , an executive of a firm that raises money for several major environmental organizations , said the movement has lost support because &quot; it has failed to demonstrate convincingly that its goals are compatible with the economic needs of the country. &quot; With a friendly Administration in Washington , environmentalists are having to learn an age-old lesson of reform politics . Social movements often have more energy when they are out of power than when they are in . The environmental movement was never bigger or better funded than during the 1980s when it was_on the outs , doing battle with two conservative Republican administrations . For old_hands in the movement , the turnabout in fortunes has been breathtaking . &quot; In all my years I have never before seen such apathy , &quot; said Liz Frenkel , a Sierra Club official in Oregon who has been an activist with the club since 1957 . Other groups , such_as the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural_Resources Defense Council and the Audubon Society are hoping to compensate for declining membership by relying more heavily on foundation support , wealthy donors , celebrity performances and novel marketing schemes . This year , for instance , singer James Taylor is giving a portion of his concert receipts to the NRDC . In a joint_venture with a stuffed animal manufacturer , the Audubon Society is offering free memberships to anyone who buys a teddy_bear named Nature Bear . For the past year , public_opinion_polls have routinely found that fewer than 5 % of Americans think that the environment is one of the nation ' s pressing problems . And although most Americans still think_of themselves as environmentalists , said Washington-based pollster Celinda Lake , &quot; not so many are inclined to identify with the environmental movement. &quot; Reflecting on the changes in attitude , some analysts argue that the movement has become a victim of its past success . &quot; People have brought the environment into their lives to such an extent through recycling or buying green products , many no doubt feel they are doing their bit and don ' t need to do any more , &quot; said Jack Murray of the Natural_Resources Defense Council . &quot; Many of us got_into this movement fighting faceless bureaucrats . . . who were hellbent on destroying some beautiful place , &quot; said Dennis Hayes , one of the architects of the first Earth Day 24 years ago , who now runs a foundation that gives $ 500 # 000 annually to environmental causes . &quot; Today , if you ask a typical American to name a bureaucrat , he ' ll point to someone in some environmental agency. &quot; Among environmental groups , the Sierra Club may be the best example of bureaucratic heft . With its $ 40-million annual budget , its Washington lobby and legal arm , its $ 6-million book business and $ 3-million worldwide eco-tourism operation , the Sierra Club looks more like a holding company than a society of nature lovers . &quot; Sometimes you want to ask : Will the real Sierra Club stand_up ? &quot; said Priscilla Feral , an animal rights advocate who tangled_with the organization earlier this year . Feral said she felt betrayed when the club refused to join a boycott of Alaskan tourism spearheaded by her group , Friends of Animals , to protest the state ' s decision to allow the trapping of wolves . Instead of joining the boycott , the Sierra Club took_out a full-page ad in the New York Times , encouraging people to travel_to Alaska and learn about the wolf issue firsthand . Club officials argued that exposing people to the wilds tended to make them wilderness advocates . But Feral accused club officials of allowing business interests to dictate environmental policy . The club ' s decision also reflected the complicated task of trying to satisfy a huge membership with widely varying views . Although many members favored the boycott , the club deferred to its Anchorage chapter , which opposed the boycott because it did not want to penalize local outfitters and guides who opposed the wolf kill . The controversy highlighted a developing rift within the movement over the impact that environmental policies have_on the lives of working people -- from farmers and ranchers to wilderness guides and outfitters . James Connor , a former head of the Montana chapter of the Sierra Club , quit the organization after it endorsed one of the most sweeping wilderness bills ever proposed in Congress . The bill , unsuccessful so far , would put a 35-million-acre , five-state swath of wilderness off limits to any economic activity . &quot; I got involved in the environmental movement because I thought it was in the enlightened self-interest of humankind , &quot; Connor said . &quot; But I ' m not in tune with what is going_on now . Something snapped . People in the movement have lost faith in humankind . They have retreated into utopian fantasies , become 100 % environmentally correct and 100 % politically impotent. &quot; Connor argued that environmental extremism has played into the hands of political opponents who repeatedly depict groups such_as the Sierra Club as enemies of working people . A broad alliance of rural landowners , suburban real_estate developers and big-city industrial interests , the opposition has combined populist rhetoric with corporate contributions to repeatedly beat_back environmental initiatives . Craver , the movement ' s fundraiser , agreed . &quot; The groups have not been good at responding to the jobs-versus-nature rhetoric that you hear in so many rural_areas , and it has hurt them. &quot; Still , not every environmental organization is suffering . The Environmental Defense Fund , which searches for market-based solutions to environmental problems , has grown from 100 # 000 members in 1990 to about 250 # 000 today , while its budget has increased just over 20 % , to $ 22 million , said Joel Plagenz , its director of public affairs . The EDF helped draft provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act that reward companies that comply with clean air standards by allowing them to sell pollution &quot; credits &quot; to firms not meeting the requirements . The group is working_on a proposal to offer financial incentives to property_owners to set_aside land that is home to endangered species . Even some environmental hard-liners have made gains , particularly in places where ecological degradation has been the most conspicuous . With 1 # 500 members scattered across the country and a $ 2-million budget , Oregon ' s Native Forest Council broke ranks with the mainstream movement when it called_for prohibiting all commercial logging in the Northwest ' s ancient forests . &quot; We cut_through the fog of rhetoric with a simple solution that appealed_to a lot of people , &quot; said Victor Rozek , one of two ex-Sierra Club_members who founded the group . But the hard-liners also are contributing to the rural backlash , and the voices of dispossessed loggers and ranchers are the ones being heard in Washington these days . &quot; The notion that rural people are under siege by a bunch of yuppies is taken quite seriously in a lot of small_towns in this country , &quot; said Andy Kerr , an early leader of the campaign to protect old-growth forests in the Northwest . &quot; A lot of environmental groups are learning that these places have a surprising amount of political influence , but they don ' t know what to do about it. &quot; Kerr thinks he does . Last winter , he moved his family from Portland to Joseph , Ore. , a small logging town where residents blamed a recent sawmill closure on environmentalists such_as Kerr . &quot; Until we start knocking_on doors and getting involved in local issues , showing people their concerns are our concerns , we ' re not going_to get very far , &quot; Kerr said . But in Washington and in the offices of the nation ' s largest environmental groups , some people are more concerned about making_peace within the movement . At the Sierra Club , officials are so concerned about internal hostilities that they have threatened to cut_off computer access to members who uses electronic_mail to vilify their colleagues . &quot; We used to wake_up in the morning knowing who the enemy was and how to face him , &quot; said Pope . &quot; All too often lately , we seem to be treating each other like the enemy. &quot; Times staff writer Mark I . Pinsky contributed to this report .</TEXT>
