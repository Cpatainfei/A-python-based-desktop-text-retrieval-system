   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : ED WOOD -- THE FILM CULT THAT would n ' t DIE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Ed Wood , &quot; Tim Burton ' s delightful homage to the cross-dressing Grade Z movie-maker , ends with a brief written epilogue that describes the fate of this unique auteur . &quot; Wood died in 1978 , &quot; it reads . &quot; Two years later he was voted Worst Director of All Time , bringing him worldwide acclaim. &quot; How did Wood go from this anonymous status to becoming the center of a thriving international cult ? And when did his rogues ' gallery of eccentric collaborators emerge from the Wood-work ? ( As Wood ' s friend and frequent star Bela Lugosi bellows in &quot; Glen or Glenda &quot; : &quot; Da story mahst be tohld ! &quot; ) I ' ll confess that I played some role in Wood ' s transformation , and thanks to Burton ' s biopic ( &quot; ' Ed Wood ' : ' 50s Blithe Spirit , &quot; Calendar , Sept . 28 ) , I can finally say with dignity that I was his cult leader . Wood ' s &quot; Worst &quot; status was not the result of some universal poll of film critics -- there were only two &quot; bad movie &quot; mavens who determined the vote , and they happened to be Harry and Michael Medved . My brother and I gave Wood the life achievement award for worst director of all time in the pages of our 1980 tome , &quot; The Golden Turkey Awards , &quot; where we recognized for the first time Wood ' s monumental contributions to the world of bad cinema . Our decision was influenced by the surprisingly strong showing of &quot; Plan 9 From Outer Space &quot; in our readers ' poll for the worst film of all time . * We felt compelled to track_down the mad genius-in-reverse who created this multilayered mess-terpiece . Rumor had it that Wood hung_out at a 16mm film rental house in central Hollywood -- this was in the days before video stores -- where he rented his favorite Westerns and Lugosi horror movies . When I asked_for help in contacting Wood , I was told , &quot; Oh , you just missed him ! &quot; &quot; Did he leave a forwarding number ? &quot; &quot; No . He just died . He had a heart_attack while watching a football game. &quot; Despite my heartbreak at his recent passing , I remained undaunted in my search to discover the &quot; true facts &quot; of his complex life and interviewed dozens of lovable lunatics who inhabited Wood ' s circle of Hollywood &quot; fringies. &quot; At the age of 17 , I had developed a fearless devotion toward my subject , somewhat akin to the relationship that Wood himself enjoyed with Lugosi , as depicted in the screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski . ( To further my connection with Wood , the personal assistant to TV psychic Criswell even offered the possibility of contacting Wood through one of their seances at the Hollywood YMCA -- and he reassured me that Criswell ' s pronouncements were &quot; 97 % accurate . . . most of the time. &quot; ) * As I journeyed into Wood ' s past , his co-workers reacted with muffled guffaws of disbelief . &quot; Plan 9 &quot; star Gregory Walcott howled through the phone receiver when I first contacted him about &quot; Eddie &quot; Wood : &quot; His was the most ridiculous film I have ever worked_on in my life ! Why in the world would anyone want to read a book about his god-awful movies ? &quot; As if to answer his question , &quot; bad film &quot; fanatics came crawling out from underneath their rocks or from under their sinks_in the early ' 80s , and a genuinely rabid Ed Wood cult began ( notably at UCLA where an All-Day Wood Marathon was held at Melnitz Hall in 1981 ) . My brother and I hosted screenings of the Wood Triptych ( &quot; Bride of the Monster , &quot; &quot; Glen or Glenda &quot; and &quot; Plan 9 &quot; ) at Worst Film Festivals on four continents , developed a successful TV series in England devoted to Wood and other schlockmeisters representing &quot; The Worst of Hollywood , &quot; and unveiled historically awful film_clips from the Wood pile on &quot; Today , &quot; &quot; The Tonight Show , &quot; &quot; The Evening News With Dan Rather &quot; and more_than 400 talk_shows around the world . David Letterman and &quot; Seinfeld &quot; devoted segments to &quot; Plan 9. &quot; Video documentaries , comic_books and trading_cards followed , but after eight years as Keepers of the Ed Wood Flame , we passed the torch to Golden Turkey fan Rudolph Grey , providing him with reams of unpublished interviews that he used for his Wood biography , &quot; Nightmare in Ecstasy. &quot; The extraordinary irony is that our epithet for Wood as &quot; Worst Director of All Time &quot; has helped make him a hot commodity . Like most of the misfit characters in Tim Burton ' s movies , Wood wanted desperately to fit into the mainstream , and now he has finally made_it , 16 years after his death . The cult followers will see_to_it that the Wood fires will never flicker . Ed , if you ' re up there in &quot; bad movie &quot; heaven with your angora wings fluttering and observing your long-overdue lionization as American popular culture phenomenon , I hope you ' re savoring every moment .</TEXT>
