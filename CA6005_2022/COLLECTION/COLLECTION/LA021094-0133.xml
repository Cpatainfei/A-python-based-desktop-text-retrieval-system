   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : WHEN THE POWER GOES_OUT , THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES ; THE QUAKE BRINGS THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY HOME . FROM GENERATORS TO FLASHLIGHTS , HERE ' S WHAT TO LOOK FOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sustainability has become an important environmental concept , especially in business . The idea of getting_by without over-dependence on outside resources can be seen in manufacturing and agriculture . In the steel_industry , for example , more companies are recycling steel rather than depending_on scarce ore , while newspapers such_as this one are using more recycled newsprint instead of virgin stock . The Northridge earthquake seems to have brought the concept of sustainability home to the consumer . &quot; Everybody wants to be self-supportive , &quot; said Ron McKee , manager of a Home Base store in Simi Valley . He reports selling many home generators , &quot; not mostly the little $ 300 ones for three or four bulbs , but more often the big ones at $ 800 that generate 3 # 500 watts. &quot; Of course , having your own generator isn ' t the perfect antidote to a power outage from a quake , fire or flood . You need gasoline . McKee recommends keeping a five-gallon supply near , but not in the generator , as petroleum left standing in a machine will gunk it up . He even recommends rotating the five-gallon gasoline stash regularly -- use it in the lawn_mower and put fresh stuff in the container . A product that gets closer to the sustainability idea is being marketed nationally by a local firm . Solarmode , in Oxnard , is marketing an emergency &quot; preparedness kit &quot; that provides electricity day and night -- from the sun . Trevor Hewson , owner of Solarmode , didn ' t suddenly decide to capitalize on the quake ; he ' s been selling &quot; self-maintaining &quot; equipment for years to camping and RV enthusiasts and homeowners who want to have electrical backup systems that don ' t require gas or batteries . Hewson said his kit includes a compact photovoltaic solar_panel , which sucks_up the sun ' s energy even on overcast days ; a power_pack , which stores the resulting direct_current in rechargeable batteries ; an inverter , which converts the direct_current to run your TV or appliances , and a pair of energy miser fluorescent_lamps , which provide bright light for extended periods . &quot; I use a setup like this when I go camping -- for lights and the radio , &quot; Hewson said . Asked how bulky this $ 300 kit is , he said it would fit into a shopping_bag . Theoretically , with one of these rigs , you can enjoy a modicum of normalcy in your powerless home even if Southern California Edison took forever to repair the power_lines . For a less pricey dose of peace_of_mind -- and something so environmentally correct that you ' ll want to brag about it at Sierra Club meetings -- you might consider getting a Dynamo &amp; Solar AM-FM receiver . With this $ 29 gizmo from Real Goods , a Northern California mail-order company , you can even survive a long-term solar_eclipse . Just turn the crank for a minute to hear 10 minutes of disaster news . Or three minutes to hear an entire Beatles ' album . Otherwise , pray for sun and when you get_it , stick the radio in the window . Real Goods has a wide selection of equipment that allows you to carry_on a &quot; sustainable &quot; existence , including a mysterious thing called a Five Gallon Solar Shower . My wife guessed that it must be something like the water-filled garden_hose she used to leave lying_in the sun to provide hot showers on camping tips . Indeed , the $ 12 Real Goods ' item uses similar sustainable technology , but provides more showers at a time . If you think shower talk is frivolous and beside the point , consider the results of my informal poll of local outlets of hardware chain_stores . When I asked representatives from both Ace and True Value to tell me the No . 1 post-quake-related purchase , they said it was equipment to reconnect or strap down home water_heaters . &quot; Copper flex pipe became our hottest seller -- 2 # 000 a day , &quot; said Jeff Arenson , who monitors supplies for all True Value stores in our area . Both chains report heavy post-quake sales in the appliance that is the perfect example of earthquake preparedness , sustainability and environmental consciousness : Black &amp; Decker ' s line of flashlights that are kept plugged into a home electrical outlet for emergency use . Each contains a_battery that , because it is constantly being recharged , is always at_the_ready . In the event of a power_failure , one model switches itself on so you can see where it is . Details * FYI : Electrical products that make you energy-independent in the event of power blackouts are available at local Ace , True Value and Home Base outlets , also at Solarmode in Oxnard 382-8318 and Real Goods in Ukiah ( 800 ) 762-7325 .</TEXT>
