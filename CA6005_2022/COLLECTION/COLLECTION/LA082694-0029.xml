   <HEADLINE> SEXUALITY IS NOT JUST ' GAY ' OR ' STRAIGHT ' ; GAY RIGHTS : A MOVEMENT THAT IDENTIFIES A PERSON BY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IS LIMITING , NOT LIBERATING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When we look_at the gay political_movement , we see 25 years since the Stonewall riots focused_on promoting gay identity . This agenda has focused_on &quot; coming_out , &quot; asking people to publicly identify themselves as homosexuals . It is an agenda aimed not at sexual freedom but defining homosexuals as a minority of persons to be protected against discrimination as defined in statutes . It attempts to cast what is essentially a moral issue as a civil-rights issue . But does this effort succeed ? The identity agenda is based on three assumptions : * Coming_out is the best way to integrate one ' s sexual experience into one ' s life and personality . * Coming_out reduces the social stereotypes and fear of homosexuality . * Coming_out has resulted in political changes promoting greater acceptance of homosexual behaviors . None of these assumptions , however , is true . Many studies have indicated that coming_out entails the adoption of the stigmatic role that society has created in_order to isolate and confine a certain behavior to a distinct population . Like other stigmatic roles , it attributes the behavior to an internal condition ( sometimes called &quot; sexual orientation &quot; ) that distinguishes some people from others . Instead of helping stigmatized persons integrate their sexual behavior into a moral system of behaviors , gay identity does just the opposite , removing it from the realm of freedom and responsibility . It objectifies the behavior , making_it a &quot; thing &quot; with a life of its own that tends to organize more and more of one ' s personality and life around sexual behavior . The identity agenda also assumes that coming_out reduces the fear of homosexual behaviors . Sociologists point_out that intimacy is rarely the solution to oppression and give the case of women ' s intimacy with men as proof . Coming_out only brings_home the lesson of stigma that no one is &quot; safe , &quot; making others even more guarded of_their_own gay feelings . Science has repeatedly confirmed that homosexual experiences are not confined to any psychological or physical type of person . Gay identity results not from an internal condition but from adopting a role that society has constructed for the purposes of controlling , isolating and confining gay behaviors . Authorities such_as Sigmund Freud , pioneering sex researcher Alfred C . Kinsey and John DeCecco , editor of the Journal of Homosexuality , have expressed the belief that everyone is born potentially bisexual and that one ' s sexual capacities and choices are influenced by a wide combination of social and personal factors . Aristotle long ago condemned our human tendency to define people by their behavior , an error of logic he called &quot; hypostasis. &quot; English philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote , &quot; Of all vulgar modes of escaping_from considerations of the effect of social and moral influence on the human mind , the most vulgar is that of attributing the diversities of conduct and character to inherent natural differences. &quot; Gay identity is the result of our society ' s intense and long-standing persecution of homosexual behaviors . As Kinsey pointed_out in 1948 , &quot; There are practically no European groups , unless it be in England , and few if any other cultures elsewhere in the world which have become as disturbed over male homosexuality as we have here in the United States. &quot; This disturbance has produced a vicious and lazy way of thinking that divides the whole world into two kinds of persons , gay and straight . Labeling people as gay and straight is a no-win agenda that only reinforces the stigma , because it is a function of the stigma . Jim Fouratt of New York , one of the leaders of the gay_liberation_movement that arose from the Stonewall riots in 1969 , wrote : &quot; Homosexual . I find the word hard to relate to because it puts me in a category which limits my potential . It also prescribes a whole system of behavior to which I ' m supposed to conform which has nothing to do with the reality of my day to day living . . . . I reject the word homosexual . I reject a category that defines my central life thrust in limiting terms . I am a human being. &quot;</TEXT>
