   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; WHAT IN THE WORLD IS BORA DOING NOW ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European media spent much energy looking_into Bora Milutinovic ' s recent flirtation as a potential coach for AC Monaco , which plays in the_French first division . that ' s because they don ' t know Bora . Milutinovic is one of the most noncommittal coaches to stand_in front of a chalkboard . He signed to coach the U.S. team to the World Cup , but that contract did little to anchor him to the country . In the summer of 1993 there were rumors that Milutinovic would leave to become the national coach of a South_American team . Far from categorically denying them , Milutinovic smiled coyly and said something to the effect that he works for Mr. Alan and he loves America . It ' s all for the benefit of Mr. Alan that these rumors start . Mr. Alan Rothenberg is Milutinovic ' s boss and , more to_the_point , pays his salary . When asked what his plans were_after the World Cup , Milutinovic said he always has his bags packed , he ' s a coach . This is the life . Eventually , Milutinovic managed to say that his future was tied to Mr. Alan and if Rothenberg won reelection as president of the U.S. Soccer Federation , then he ' d stick_around . Rothenberg won , and still Milutinovic ' s name is floated for coaching openings around the world . Even given Milutinovic ' s reputation as a successful coach of national teams and the U.S. team ' s surprising performance in the World Cup , it ' s strange that the soccer world doesn ' t view Milutinovic as a coach working and looking_to stay in the United States , because he ' s still under contract until the end of the year . Like most , Milutinovic would like to be paid more money . To gain leverage with his boss , Milutinovic must demonstrate that he ' s a sought-after talent who might leave at any time . The more Milutinovic ' s name is out there , the more gilded his reputation becomes , the higher his salary will become . On this , Milutinovic is not wishy-washy . And in this regard , he has taken_on true American characteristics . As he might say -- My friend , this is the life . * While goalkeeper Brad Friedel continues to get the runaround regarding his work_permit in England , Cobi Jones , at least , got_into his first game in the_English Premier League last week . His team , Coventry City , beat Leeds United in Jones ' debut . It was also Coventry ' s first victory of the season . Jones was responsible_for one of Coventry ' s goals when he was pulled_down for a penalty kick after making a swift run and eluding a handful of defenders . However , Jones ' role was only grudgingly acknowledged . The Observer ' s account of the game referred to Jones as &quot; the little U.S. player. &quot; * The decision by the_English Football Assn . to eliminate shootouts in some lower division matches should be cheered by anyone who remembers the World Cup_final . Under the experimental system that will be used in November , if the game is tied after 90 minutes , one player from each team is removed every five minutes for the next 20 minutes , until there are seven players per side . If the game is still tied , another 10 minutes of sudden_death are played . Officials haven ' t figured_out what to do if neither team scores after that , but the fact that soccer ' s staid officials are tinkering with ways to make the game more fan-friendly is a welcome development . * The French have presented the logo of the 1998 World Cup -- a soccer_ball / globe representing a sunrise . World Cup organizers always treat the unveiling of the logo as a landmark event . What it does is signal the beginning of the merchandising stampede . It also allows sponsors to get the logo on those soda_cans . The best thing to come_out of the news_conference was a remark by FIFA official Guermillo Canedo . In light of the fact that France failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup and considering France is host of the next one , Canedo remarked that while he liked the logo , &quot; We don ' t know yet if the_French team will be good. &quot; Thanks for sharing . Also in France , after two unusual incidents of violence recently , club officials say they will start bringing legal_action against fans who cause trouble at matches . Jean-Louis Levreau , vice_president of Marseilles , needed stitches after suffering a gash in his cheek , caused by a fan who threw a stone after a match in Paris . &quot; We ' re going to sue , &quot; Levreau said . &quot; This is not football , this is war. &quot; In another incident , the goalkeeper for Lens was punched and knocked_down by a fan who rushed on the field at Bordeaux . The French are accustomed to relative tranquillity on the field -- if not off -- and have a low tolerance for mischief . The threats of lawsuits should signal that club officials are serious . * Soccer might be becoming too_much of a good thing in Italy . A group representing 4 # 000 Rome restaurant owners has asked the Italian prime_minister to intervene in a situation that , last week , allowed Roman soccer fans to watch a live match every night of the week except Monday and Friday . The restaurant owners complain that televised matches keep their potential clients at_home , in front of the TV . During the middle of the week the various European club and national competitions are televised and Italian league games are shown on Saturday and Sunday . Even the players are beginning to complain . Roberto Baggio noted that with so_much soccer on television , fans will stop attending games . The restaurant owners have a point , but there ' s one problem with their plea to Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi : Berlusconi owns the country ' s biggest team , AC Milan , and a television channel that broadcasts European soccer . * Germany and South_Africa would like to play host to the 2006 World Cup_finals . The countries offer sound and similar arguments for their candidacy : politically reunited nations that can boast strong fan support for soccer . Germany has the advantage of a superior infrastructure and organization , in addition to well-placed officials within FIFA . South_Africa also has large , modern stadiums . Its advantage is FIFA would like the symbolism of placing the World Cup in South_Africa -- soccer as a means for peoples of the world to come_together in peace -- and , like the United States , Africa is a vast and still-untapped resource for soccer talent and future revenues . Like the United States , however , South_Africa ' s sprawling size might work against its bid as will nagging doubts about its political stability . By the turn_of_the_century , when the bids are awarded , much can change .</TEXT>
