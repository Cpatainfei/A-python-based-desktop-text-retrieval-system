   <HEADLINE> HAS BLACK COMEDY BEEN BEATEN BLUE ? ; ' DEF COMEDY JAM ' IS A HIT -- BUT WITH SOME AFRICAN AMERICAN COMICS TURNING TO CABLE SHOWS THAT LIMIT THE RAUNCHINESS , CLEAN AND SUBTLE COULD BE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The makeshift &quot; green room &quot; at the Ebony Showcase Theatre in South-Central Los Angeles was filled with the sweet smell of fresh soul food and the sting of dueling punch_lines from comedians waiting their turn_to &quot; kick it &quot; with the overflow crowd waiting in the jammed theater downstairs . Seasoned veterans of the African American comic scene -- T . K . Carson from &quot; The Sinbad Show &quot; and John Henton from &quot; Living Single &quot; -- mixed easily with aspiring comics while a monitor showed the live proceedings taking_place below . Onstage , comedian Paul Mooney , wearing a blue scarf over his head , was saying , &quot; White people are always trying to bring big dead white people back to life , like Elvis . You don ' t ever hear anybody saying , ' Hey , I just saw Sammy Davis Jr . shopping at the supermarket. ' &quot; The predominantly black audience roared its approval as cameras rolled . The steady stream of comedians had gathered for a marathon taping session of &quot; Comic Justice , &quot; Comedy Central ' s showcase for black comedians and vintage film_clips honoring black entertainers from the past . &quot; Comic Justice &quot; is one of a series of existing and proposed programs fashioned after &quot; Russell Simmons ' Def Comedy Jam , &quot; the HBO late-night showcase that has propelled the grass-roots popularity of black stand-up comedy into the national mainstream . The 3-year-old show has given unprecedented exposure to young performers who use comedy to express their anger and observations about growing_up black . Yet &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; has become just as infamous for the unabashed rawness and profanity used by many of the comedians in depicting X-rated sex and raunchy behavior -- no-holds-barred material that might make even fans of Richard Pryor , Redd Foxx or Eddie Murphy blush . And that has created a backlash . Comedians at the &quot; Comic Justice &quot; taping said the success of the HBO series has been a double-edged sword , making black comedians a hot commodity but creating an expectation among audiences and club owners that all black comics must be blue . Indeed , &quot; Comic Justice &quot; was conceived last year in response to &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; as a showcase for &quot; clean &quot; black comedians . &quot; We ' re trying to aspire to a higher energy , &quot; explained Jerry Kramer , the show ' s director and co-producer . &quot; You can be funny without saying ( expletive ) before every noun . You can talk_about any issue without cursing. &quot; * The arrival of &quot; Comic Justice &quot; and other black stand-up shows , such_as &quot; Comicview &quot; on Black Entertainment Television , comes as &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; continues to grow far beyond its limited audience at HBO . Two &quot; best of &quot; compilations are available in video stores . Groups of comedians traveling under the &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; banner have been playing to sold-out audiences around the country , and future tours are planned . Comics featured on the show continue to be feverishly courted by the networks as performers or writers . A special , &quot; Bad Girls of Def , &quot; is scheduled on HBO in July , and &quot; Def Jam &quot; producers have been working_on a toned-down version of their show that they hope to sell to a network . The series has even spawned a Latino version , &quot; Loco Slam , &quot; which will air on HBO in June ( see story , Page 62 ) . Comedians at the &quot; Comic Justice &quot; taping acknowledged the groundbreaking nature of &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; and praised the series for helping black comedians make inroads . But they and others maintain that the show ' s edgy style of humor has promoted an overemphasis among black comics on raunchy , in-your-face comedy rather than on more subtle , insightful humor . Much of the &quot; Def Jam &quot; humor , they charge , is degrading to women , employs racial epithets and uses stereotypes that portray black_men and women as oversexed , loud and profane . And young audiences , particularly those who like rap_music , now expect black comics to perform &quot; Def Jam &quot; -style material . &quot; Audiences who have been attending comedy clubs haven ' t changed , but there is a new audience out there , the hip-hop audience , and the ' Def Jam ' stuff is what they want to see , &quot; said A . J . Jamal , the host of &quot; Comic Justice. &quot; &quot; I ' ve performed in front of mixed audiences , and young brothers will come_up_to me afterward and say , ' I guess you couldn ' t let yourself go_off or talk_about somebody ' s mama because there were white people in the audience , right ? ' Then I have to tell them I don ' t do that type of material. &quot; * Jamal and others also complain that aspiring comics , influenced by &quot; Def Comedy Jam , &quot; think they can get_by with just a_few minutes of raunchy jokes without providing a social context or a personal identity such_as a Richard Pryor or a Redd Foxx . &quot; With Richard Pryor , you never knew the cursing was there , &quot; said Jamal , a former regular on Fox ' s &quot; In Living Color. &quot; &quot; It was brilliant . Now it ' s ' F this ' and ' F that , ' ' N this ' and ' N that. ' Like , where ' s the joke ? These guys don ' t even introduce themselves . They just start right off saying those words . Why does_it have to be so violent , and why does there have to be so_much bad language ? &quot; The creators and producers of &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; bristle_at the blasts against their program , saying that critics have the wrong impression about the show and the style of comedy . &quot; We do not look_for blue or raw_material , &quot; said Stan Lathan , &quot; Def Comedy Jam ' s &quot; director and one of the executive producers . &quot; When we sold this show to HBO , it was conceived as a show where we could present a club setting that was real and pure . We do not tell any of the comics what to say or what to do . There are lots of comics who do clean sets. &quot; Lathan continued : &quot; Sure , there is a lot of blue stuff on the show , a lot of extremely graphic sexual material . But this is the material that these comics do_in the clubs . We ' re presenting the purest state of black American comedy . This is a fact. &quot; Rap_music mogul Russell Simmons , who created &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; and is another one of its three executive producers , said : &quot; Black comics have a real forum on ' Def Jam , ' not these other places . No matter what anyone says , it ' s an honest expression of our culture . There is absolutely no emphasis on being dirty . The emphasis is_on being honest. &quot; Lathan , a television veteran who is also producer and director of Fox ' s &quot; Roc , &quot; said : &quot; I understand the sensitivity of many black people to the images that are presented on our show . I agree in many cases that television does a disservice to black people . But ' Def Comedy Jam ' is a show that ' s on very late at night on an adult pay-TV network . It ' s available to a very limited audience . It ' s not in your face at 8:30 or 9 p.m. on the networks. &quot; Mooney , a former writer for Richard Pryor and a veteran of the comedy scene , calls the finger-pointing &quot; just more black-on-black crime . ' Def Jam ' is part of the black experience . If things were equal , there would n ' t be a need for a ' Def Jam. ' People need to get hip_to that . &quot; Nevertheless , the creators of &quot; Comic Justice &quot; and &quot; Comicview &quot; say their programs provide a timely and essential alternative to prove that black doesn ' t have to be blue . Comedians appearing on the shows are told to check their four-letter and 12-letter obscenities , as well as their more sexually explicit material , at the door . Though some references_to drugs and urban ills remain , the comics ' delivery is closer to &quot; Ed Sullivan &quot; than &quot; Def Comedy Jam. &quot; Andre Wiseman of M . L . Management , which produces &quot; Comic Justice &quot; in association with Visualize Productions , said he and colleagues developed the show because &quot; clean &quot; black comedians needed a television showcase . &quot; We wanted to focus_on family values and honesty . We interview everyone beforehand , and all_the comedians , including the ones who use profanity in their act , know this is a positive thing we ' re doing. &quot; Mark Adkins , Wiseman ' s partner , said : &quot; For some of these comedians , it ' s a relief for them to do clean comedy . They can ' t use profanity , so they are challenged to do their comedy another way . This kind of show increases their marketability. &quot; In addition to showcasing comics , &quot; Comic Justice &quot; also spotlights vintage film_clips featuring Hattie McDaniel , Eddie ( Rochester ) Anderson , Sammy Davis Jr . and vaudeville teams . &quot; It ' s important to show the legacy , &quot; Wiseman said . * Unlike &quot; Comic Justice , &quot; which features more established comics , BET ' s &quot; Comicview &quot; is designed as a competition for up-and-coming black comedians . The comics are told to do &quot; clean and original &quot; material , which is then judged by a panel of entertainment_industry professionals . Weekly winners are eligible to star in their own half-hour comedy special . Lynn Taylor , producer and director of &quot; Comicview , &quot; said that though her show was not developed as a direct reaction to &quot; Def Comedy Jam , &quot; &quot; we thought there was a need for a lot of good and talented comics who do not use profanity in their acts . We wanted to show that you could enjoy this kind of comedy without having to send the kids or the grandparents out of the room. &quot; Actor-comedian Dave Chappelle said he thought it was about time that shows like &quot; Comicview &quot; and &quot; Comic Justice &quot; came_along : &quot; ' Def Jam ' is cool ; it ' s a good thing . I just think people should realize it ' s not the only thing . There has to be a balance. &quot; * Chappelle said &quot; Def Jam &quot; has definitely had an influence on the expectations of audiences and club owners toward black comedians : &quot; You have to remember , when ' Def Jam ' started , it was huge . It was a lot of white people ' s first introduction to ( that kind of stand-up ) comedy , and it ' s what they thought it was all about . I found when I was touring that , in a lot of people ' s minds , especially young people , your comedy was not as colorful if you were less blue . And club owners , when they would see that I ' m young and black , would be reluctant to deal with me , saying : ' He ' s one of those &quot; Def Jam &quot; comics. ' &quot; Ajai Sanders , a comedian who was also a regular on NBC ' s &quot; A Different World , &quot; said she had not planned to perform blue material when she appeared on &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; two years ago . But she said she altered her routine because of the audience : &quot; When I was_on ' Def Jam , ' the pressure to be dirty was really there. &quot; Part of her routine centered_on the simulation of a sexually explicit act between her and her boyfriend . The young crowd responded enthusiastically . &quot; ' Def Jam ' started_out as a venue where a comic could be fly but clever , &quot; Sanders said . &quot; Now the cleverness has been thrown_out . It ' s about time we had a show like ' Comic Justice. ' We need this and ' Def Comedy Jam. ' I like this better . I ' m more comfortable. &quot; Although she said she is grateful for the exposure she received from &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; ( &quot; I couldn ' t go anywhere without people recognizing me &quot; ) , Sanders said she would never go_on the show again : &quot; I just feel_like I need to challenge myself more. &quot; Chappelle said he just taped his second &quot; Jam &quot; session , and &quot; it went really well . The first time I did_it , I was a bit blue , but this time , I was more myself . It was a show of all clean comedians. &quot; Jamal and others said they believe that the raw style of black comedy is a passing phase . &quot; Eventually clean comedy will come_back , comedy that is mainstream , where the language will be more like Bill Cosby , &quot; he said . * Lathan said that he is not threatened by the competition and that there is room for all_the black comedy shows , blue and non-blue . &quot; We all feed each other , &quot; he said . &quot; We as black producers are all going_to benefit -- there ' s no question about it . It ' s gone from the grass roots to the mainstream , and we can have every aspect of the spectrum . And the whole entertainment_industry will take_on a flavor that will be a little more black. &quot; * * &quot; Comic Justice &quot; airs Saturdays at 11 p.m. and Sundays at 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central . ( The episodes taped in Los Angeles will start airing in April. ) &quot; Comicview &quot; can be seen nightly at 5:30 and 10 o ' clock_on BET . &quot; Def Comedy Jam &quot; airs Fridays at midnight and in various other late-night slots during the week on HBO .</TEXT>
