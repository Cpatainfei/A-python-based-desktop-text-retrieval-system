   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; PARISIEN ' S STORY IS BAD NEWS / BAD NEWS ; SKIING : SHE HAD A TRAGIC ' 92 , WHEN SHE LOST A MEDAL AND THEN HER BROTHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It took U.S. skier Julie Parisien 20 years to reach the mountaintop in ski_racing , but less than one year to lose an Olympic gold medal and her brother . So_much for life ' s fairness . So_much for 1992 . Grief , cloaked in degrees , became Parisien ' s night stalker . The Olympic loss struck first -- what a gnawing pain it seemed then -- on the slopes of Meribel , France , at the 1992 Albertville Games . A month before , Parisien had crashed into a recreational skier and lost four front_teeth . A few days later , she cracked her wrist on a slalom gate in Italy . But she charged into Albertville , fought_off the pain , flashed her newly capped teeth , was fitted for a cast , taped her injured wrist to her ski_pole and went_on her Olympic way , choosing to ignore this run of misfortune . Parisien posted the fastest time after the first run of the Olympic slalom . The gold was hers to lose . Between races , she went_back to her room , alone . &quot; We had so_long between runs , that was the hard part , &quot; Parisien recalls . &quot; It was about 2 1 / 2 hours . Usually we have about 45 minutes . Looking_back , I would have stayed and hung_out with the rest of the competitors . It wasn ' t that I thought too_much , but I think I got a little complacent , a little mellow . It was like , ' Cool. ' &quot; Parisien wins gold in France . Cool . No , magnificent . So how come the second run was slow_motion , compared to the first ? She knew she had blown it mid-run and expected the worst , then looked_up at the leader board and found it . Parisien did not simply squander the gold , she finished fourth -- the ultimate Olympic indignity -- losing the bronze by five-hundredths of a second . Could there be anything worse ? Yes . The next Dec . 17 , while Parisien was away at a World Cup race in Canada , older brother Jean-Paul , her mentor , was killed when his car was run_off the road by a driver only miles from the family home_in Auburn , Maine . J.P. , a student at the University of Colorado , was returning home for the Christmas holidays . &quot; It was a hit-and-run , but they found the guy 15 minutes later , &quot; Parisien says , recounting the story . &quot; There was black ice around this corner , and J.P. was going_about 40 , under the speed_limit , and this guy pulled_out to pass him . He was a disabled driver as well , he was driving with hand controls . ( He was also ) a habitual drunk . He rear-ended J.P. and he spun_around and hit a tree. &quot; Unlike those relatives who seek justice to ensure closure on tragedy , Parisien did not involve herself with the post-crash particulars . &quot; The guy ' s life is ruined already , &quot; she says . &quot; He ' s a paraplegic , he ' s a drunk and now he ' s killed someone. &quot; Given the emotional weight of the last two years , it comes as no great surprise that Parisien -- the world ' s top-ranked slalom skier a year ago -- is struggling . These were to have been the Olympic Games of redemption , a chance to right the wrong of ' 92 . Patience is not one of Parisien ' s virtues , so it had to be fate that she would have to wait only two years before Lillehammer . Yet , Parisien begins the 1994 Olympics battered and bruised emotionally , with only a_few top-15 finishes to show for her season . She is no longer among the top 20 slalom skiers in the world . What went_wrong ? In the weeks after J.P. ' s death , Parisien had jumped right back onto her skis . &quot; I knew I had to get_back , &quot; she says . &quot; I couldn ' t mope . You grieve , you go_through this whole terrible process , but it ' s a process , and you just have to keep things as normal as you can . Your mind and your heart are so gone . But you go_out with your friends , even though it ' s hard ; you go_out with people who are going_to make you feel safe . You put_on a good face , you go on. &quot; Her brother was gone , but Parisien swears he was there in some form , propping her up . Three weeks after Christmas , when Parisien slightly twisted her knee , J.P. kept pushing her , all_the way to the World Championships in Morioka , Japan , at which Parisien got a silver medal in slalom . Yet , afterward , she was almost despondent because she hadn ' t won gold for her brother . Parisien continued to feel J.P. ' s presence . Together , perhaps , they were destined to take the gold in Lillehammer and make some sense of his loss . Everywhere she looked , there was J.P. , in some incarnation . Sometimes he took the form of her other brother , Rob . &quot; There were times when it was Robby turning_into J.P. &quot; she says . &quot; He ' d say something that sounded so_much like him . There are mystical feelings . You feel presence. &quot; Last summer , Parisien sought a fresh_start . She requested that she train independently of the team with Rob Clayton , who had coached her on the Alpine B team . The U.S. team agreed to try it . As Parisien struggled to put the pieces back together , it was arranged for former World Cup champion Tamara McKinney to accompany her to Italy in October for pre-World Cup training . But none of this -- not Clayton , not McKinney -- translated into results , and after several mediocre performances early in the season , the Clayton plan was scrapped and Parisien returned to the team . Parisien ' s slump continued through Christmas . In fact , she had to rally in January with a_couple_of top-15 performances just to meet the U.S. team ' s Olympic qualifying criteria . Although she has yet to crack the top 10 , Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , thinks there is time to repair Parisien before the gates open on her specialty , the slalom , on Feb . 26 . &quot; Julie has really struggled at times , &quot; Major said last week . &quot; It ' s been a real emotional battle. &quot;</TEXT>
