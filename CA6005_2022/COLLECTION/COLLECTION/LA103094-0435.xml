   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA ' S ELECTIONS ; PROP . 187 ; 187 : DENIES SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> P roposition 187 proposes action in several major areas : education , health , social_services and law_enforcement . Following is a summary of how the measure would impact each area and arguments for and against its passage . SCHOOLS * WHAT IT DOES Proposition 187 requires educational administrators to verify the legal_status of each child -- and their parents -- enrolled in public elementary and secondary_schools . Children who cannot prove they are citizens or lawfully admitted immigrants would be barred from school after a 90-day period . School administrators would also be required to forward the names of suspected illegal immigrant children and parents to the INS , the state_attorney general and state superintendent of public instruction . Estimates by various authorities have placed the number of students statewide who could be expelled as a result of this provision at between 300 # 000 and 400 # 000 . The annual savings for excluding 300 # 000 students could amount to $ 1.2 billion annually . However , passage of Proposition 187 would put at risk $ 2.3 billion in annual federal education funding because the reporting of suspected illegal immigrants appears to violate the provisions of a federal educational privacy act , according to the state legislative analyst . Unlike other provisions of the ballot measure , which would take_effect immediately upon passage , verification of the legal_status of children enrolling in school for the first time would begin Jan . 1 , 1995 . By Jan . 1 , 1996 , the status of current students and their parents would have to be checked . Both sides agree that passage of Proposition 187 would result in a legal challenge . In order for this component of the law to take_effect , the U.S. Supreme Court would have to ignore or reverse its decision in the 1982 Plyler vs . Doe case , which made_it unconstitutional to deny public education to undocumented school-age children . The proposition includes a clause , common in statewide initiatives , saying that if any portion of the measure is held invalid , other portions would remain in_effect . * ARGUMENTS FOR Sponsors say that by reducing the number of students in schools across California , classroom overcrowding and educational costs would be significantly reduced . The state ' s student-to-teacher ratio could be decreased , costly bilingual programs could be reduced and the quality of education could be improved for students who are legal residents . The process of verifying legal_status would not require major bureaucratic entanglements since school administrators already are responsible_for receiving identification documents and health records for students enrolling in school . Students who do not produce documents will be reported to the INS so they can be returned to their home countries to receive an education . A challenge of the Plyler vs . Doe decision could force the Supreme Court , which now includes six new members , to reverse its decision , allowing this measure , and similar ones that other states might be encouraged to enact , to stand . * ARGUMENTS AGAINST Opponents say it is unfair to turn school administrators into quasi-immigration officers and immoral to turn children into scapegoats because their parents may have broken the nation ' s immigration laws . If children are not educated , yet remain in the country , they are bound to be a costly , long-term burden to society . The measure provides no specific means of deporting illegal immigrants so most would remain in the state . Youngsters who are_on the streets rather than in school would be more likely to turn_to street gangs , drugs and lives of crime . Even some youngsters who are citizens could face problems remaining in school if their parents were reported to authorities as illegal immigrants . The legal challenge that would result if Proposition 187 passes would be costly , time-consuming and would , in all likelihood , result in the Supreme Court reaffirming its 1982 decision . If the sponsors of 187 were serious about saving taxpayers ' money and wanted to challenge the court decision , opponents ask , why aren ' t they doing_it without forcing taxpayers to foot the bill ? PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES * WHAT IT DOES : The state ' s public colleges , universities and community_colleges would be barred from admitting pupils who are not citizens or lawfully admitted immigrants . Administrators would be required to verify the legal_status of all students and provide the names of those suspected of being illegal immigrants to state and federal_officials . Undocumented students currently taking courses for credit at community_colleges or the University of California are required to pay non-resident tuition to cover the cost of their education . Students in the California State University system , in_accord with a court ruling , pay in-state tuition . * ARGUMENTS FOR Those who break the law by being in California illegally should not be allowed to make use of the state ' s public_services . * ARGUMENTS AGAINST There is no reason to penalize students who are paying their own way through school . The release of information to immigration authorities would violate federal privacy requirements and jeopardize at least $ 1.1 billion in federal funds subject_to these standards . HEALTH_CARE * WHAT IT DOES Virtually all health_care clinics and hospitals would be barred from providing any services other_than emergency medical_care to anyone who cannot prove that he is a U.S. citizen , a lawfully admitted permanent resident or a lawfully permitted temporary visitor . The wording of the measure indicates that medical service could not be provided at publicly funded hospitals and clinics even if a patient was willing to pay_for it . Those suspected of being illegal immigrants would be refused health_care and would have their names forwarded to the state Director of Health Services , the state_attorney general and the INS . Currently , illegal immigrants are eligible for prenatal services and nursing_home care_for the elderly and disabled . They also participate in public health programs such_as immunizations and testing for sexually transmitted disease . Illegal immigrants are generally not eligible for non-emergency Medi-Cal services but can receive basic indigent health_care service . Eliminating these services would provide savings of more_than $ 100 million a year , according to the legislative analyst , but also appears to run_afoul of federal confidentiality requirements , placing at risk the approximately $ 9 billion in annual federal funds California receives for its entire Medi-Cal program . * ARGUMENTS FOR In an ideal world , all people who need health_care would receive it . But with health costs high , a system of rationing is required . Proposition 187 would accomplish that , saving taxpayers the expense of subsidizing the health_care costs of those living_in California illegally . Strict controls on health_care might even persuade illegal immigrants to leave California or not come here in the first place . Since illegal immigrants are not screened for diseases , any effort aimed at reducing their numbers might limit the spread of infectious_diseases into the state . The measure also does not preclude concerned opponents from setting_up their own privately funded clinics to pay_for and dispense vaccinations and other medical services . Sponsors of Proposition 187 have suggested that groups ranging from the Catholic_Church to the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund could take_over such services -- and remove the cost from taxpayers ' wallets -- since they are so concerned about the rights of illegal immigrants . As for the $ 9 billion of at-risk funds , proponents say it is politically naive to think that the Clinton_Administration , faced with a 1996 national election , would deny billions of dollars of funds to California because the state refused to pay_for services to illegal immigrants . * ARGUMENTS AGAINST Disease does not recognize borders or ask_for green_cards . Therefore , denying care to illegal immigrants could result in the spread of illnesses to the general population . The lack of preventive treatment , particularly for pregnant women , is likely to have much steeper long-term emergency medical costs , since children born in the United State are citizens . Already overcrowded emergency_rooms would be further packed , and the measure , as written , might even prevent screening exams to determine whether an emergency exists when a patient arrives . Also unclear is just when an emergency is no longer an emergency , and therefore , when hospitals would have to report the legal_status of patients who are illegal immigrants to federal authorities . Proposition 187 is likely to have such a chilling effect that illegal immigrants who need medical_care might not seek it until it is too late . The measure would also turn doctors and nurses into quasi-immigration agents when their time is more properly spent dealing with the public health . SOCIAL_SERVICES * WHAT IT DOES Proposition 187 requires the cutoff of all public social_services to anyone other_than U.S. citizens or immigrants lawfully admitted as permanent residents or temporary visitors . All persons employed in providing these services would be called_on to verify the legal_status of applicants and turn_in the names of anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant to federal authorities and the state_attorney general ' s office . Illegal immigrants are already precluded from receiving most major publicly funded social_service grants , including food_stamps , unemployment insurance and welfare . If Proposition 187 is approved , the list of banned services would be extended_to child welfare and foster care benefits , publicly funded family_planning programs and specialized government efforts targeting at-risk groups , including abused and parentless children , the elderly , blind , homeless , mentally impaired and drug abusers . Passage of Proposition 187 could save counties and the state roughly $ 50 million a year , the legislative analyst estimates . It would also put at risk about $ 3 billion in federal matching funds for Aid to Families With Dependent Children because the reporting requirement runs counter to federal confidentiality regulations . * ARGUMENTS FOR Illegal immigrants who are paid the minimum_wage or even less for their labor cannot afford to live_in many parts of California without supplementing their income with public benefits . For that reason , a certain percentage takes_advantage of social_service programs , if need be , by using false identifications . Strict verification standards might make some illegal immigrants think_twice about seeking social_services they do not qualify for . Moreover , taxpayers should not have to pay_for any services at all for those who enter the United States illegally . Every time an illegal immigrant takes_advantage of a social_service program , less money is available for American citizens . Moreover , politically speaking , it is silly to think that the federal_government would cut_off $ 3 billion in funds from California because the state is not paying_for social_services for illegal immigrants . * ARGUMENTS AGAINST Most social_services are already beyond the legal reach of illegal immigrants . If there is fraud in those programs , the state simply should enforce the rules that already exist . It would be mean-spirited to extend the ban to programs for foster_children and other needy youths . Indeed , if youngsters taken from abusive parents or without any parents at all are booted_out of county programs , it is unclear just what their fate would be . The ballot measure does not stiffen the penalty for falsely obtaining services currently unavailable to illegal immigrants . Yet it puts at risk federal funding for all AFDC cases , including those of legal residents . POLICE * WHAT IT DOES All law_enforcement agencies would be required to fully cooperate with the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service after arresting anyone suspected of being an illegal alien . Law_enforcement officers would seek to verify the legal_status of all people arrested by questioning them regarding their date and place_of_birth and entry into the United States . Documentation would be demanded regarding citizenship status . Arrestees who appear to be in the United States illegally would be informed , apart from any criminal justice proceedings , that they must obtain legal_status or leave the country . Officers would notify the state_attorney general and the INS of the names of all arrestees suspected of being illegal immigrants . The measure would apparently void all municipal sanctuary ordinances protecting refugees and end limited-cooperation agreements the INS has with some law_enforcement agencies . * ARGUMENTS FOR Law_enforcement officers already seek the identity and legal_status of those arrested , so this provision would hardly turn California into a police_state . Besides , the measure only applies to those arrested for other crimes -- people cannot be arrested on the suspicion of being an illegal immigrant . Getting_tough on the illegal immigration issue requires action that would prevent local communities from granting any shelter to those who are in the United States illegally . Passage of the measure would increase the pressure for federal authorities to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes -- and who now make_up about one-sixth of the state ' s prison population . * ARGUMENTS AGAINST The aura of suspicion created by Proposition 187 would make_it tougher for police to do their job . Crime witnesses and victims would be less willing to cooperate with law_enforcement authorities if they feared they might be reported to federal immigration officers . Law_enforcement agencies across California are already stretched to their limits and will be forced to deal with more paperwork and bureaucracy by having to report all suspects . With more_than 300 # 000 illegal immigrant youngsters expelled from school , the job of police will be even tougher . FALSE DOCUMENTS * WHAT IT DOES : Proposition 187 provides a new state penalty of five years in prison or a $ 75 # 000 fine for manufacturing , distributing or selling false citizenship or resident alien documents . It also provides a new state penalty of five years in prison or a $ 25 # 000 fine for using fake citizenship documents . * ARGUMENTS FOR Stiffening the penalty for selling or using false documents might make illegal immigrants more reluctant to use fake identifications to apply for jobs or for government-funded social_service and health programs . That , in turn , would free up more jobs for American citizens and result in fewer phony public welfare claims . * ARGUMENTS AGAINST The manufacture or use of false immigration or citizenship documents is already a federal crime and the state already has statutes against the forgery of such documents as driver ' s licenses . Why impose such severe sanctions against individuals who are most often carrying fake papers so that they can find work , usually at meager wages ?</TEXT>
