   <HEADLINE> SCHOOLING BY GENDER ; SOME TEEN-AGERS THRIVE IN GIRLS-AND BOYS-ONLY INSTITUTIONS . OTHERS SAY THEY ' D GO CRAZY IN SUCH A SITUATION . ARE THERE SOCIAL OR ACADEMIC ADVANTAGES ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Do students at single-sex schools fare better than those at coeducational schools ? And by what measure : Academically ? Socially ? The debate over the merits of boys-only , girls-only and integrated schools has been going_on for decades and seems no closer to resolution than it ' s ever been . Opponents of single-sex schools argue they violate federal law prohibiting sexual discrimination in federally subsidized school programs . As a result , a number of previously single-sex schools have converted to co-educational facilities or merged with opposite-sex schools , and others are considering similar moves . On the other hand , some co-educational schools are experimenting with single-sex classes as a way to bolster students ' self-esteem and academic performance . Advocates of all-girls schools cite studies showing that in the classroom , boys seem to be called_on more frequently than girls , and boys are praised or criticized more often . Some boys also tend to interrupt girls , making_fun of them and their contributions . Studies show that upon entering first_grade , girls score higher on virtually every standardized achievement test and for years after remain superior in verbal skills . By the time they graduate from high_school , however , girls are_well behind boys in every area , including verbal . Among factors cited as possible reasons for the shift in performance are subtle differences in the way teachers respond to male and female students , attitudes on the part of students about sexual roles and sexual_harassment . In a study last year of conversations with 150 high_school and middle_school students in California , nearly all had seen , experienced or participated in some form of sexual_harassment , according to Elizabeth Kennan , president of Mount Holyoke College . School has become a threatening place for many girls , who have become afraid to call attention to themselves , she said . * With the removal of males as distracters and harassers , many girls believe they are at an advantage . &quot; Single-sex schools give girls a chance to discover their capabilities without the neglect that they receive in the presence of the opposite sex . The temporary segregation disallows the many outside influences that have interfered with female advancement for years , &quot; said Katie Gibson , a senior at Rosary , an all-girls high_school in Fullerton . Rosary sophomore Shilpa Balan thinks &quot; single-sex schools give girls a chance to express themselves and feel good about who they are . These girls can become assertive women. &quot; Other girls believe_in a different advantage . &quot; I think that being in an all-girls school is more comfortable than in a co-ed school because you don ' t have to worry about what you ' re going to wear or what the boys will think_of you . You compete against other girls and you don ' t have to worry about the competitive obstacles males put_up to be better than you , &quot; said Lorrie Waldle , a junior at Rosary . During adolescence , boys and girls are under tremendous pressure from society , friends , family -- you name it . Single-sex schools can serve as a refuge . Rosary junior Selene Macias believes this kind of advantage is more important than others . &quot; I prefer being in an all-girls school , not because I can come_to school everyday looking_like a monster -- I dress nicely for myself . I like being in an all-girls school because I can raise my hand and answer a question without worrying about some guy yelling it out first. &quot; Brendan Powers , a Rosary English_teacher and co-ed high_school graduate observed , &quot; When girls leave Rosary , they seem more confident and well-spoken than students at co-ed schools. &quot; * Is the improved academic environment for girls seen in female-only schools also found to exist for boys in male-only schools ? Two Michigan educational researchers found that all-boys Catholic_schools are at least as academically strict as the girls ' schools . Yet boys in the single-sex schools had no comparable advantage over boys in co-ed schools , they said . This does not mean boys ' schools have no advantage ; it shows that the advantages are less tangible . Some graduates of boys ' schools claim the importance of tradition -- a tradition that even boys at first doubtful of the system come_to cherish . Boys ' schools share many of the advantages of girls schools : you can remove the opposite-sex distraction factor and have fewer boys worrying about being &quot; Joe Cool. &quot; All-male schools are also credited with providing an environment that helps form enduring friendships . And boys in this environment can develop a deeper &quot; care factor , &quot; learning to listen and care_for one another in the absence of females , who are stereotypically the comforters . Some argue that if girls ' schools encourage females to get involved in traditionally &quot; male &quot; interests , such_as math and science , then boys ' schools encourage males to get involved in traditionally &quot; female &quot; interests , such_as theater and art . Rudy Salo , a junior at Servite , an all-boys Catholic_school in Anaheim , believes &quot; single-sex schools are more beneficial than co-ed schools because there are no distractions from the opposite sex and less gossip. &quot; * Students at all three types of schools point to differences in socialization opportunities -- which some see as important to well-being as academic opportunities . &quot; Single-sex schools are bad because they hinder one ' s confidence in being with members of the opposite sex , &quot; said Tony Cardenas , a junior at Servite . Rosary junior Gretchen Adams expressed a similar opinion . &quot; People don ' t know how to act around people of the opposite sex when they get_together in groups and ( they ) come_across as really immature. &quot; In addition , some students feel the transition from a single-sex high_school to a co-ed college can be difficult . &quot; At a single-sex school , you can only hear from the view point of that sex , and you are not aware of the other sex ' s viewpoint . I think that being able to see two sides of an issue on an everyday basis is something a co-ed school offers , &quot; said Jessica Alaniz , a sophomore at Rosary . Thomas Lee , a sophomore at Brea Olinda , a co-ed high_school in Brea , simply says : &quot; Co-ed schools are better because there are males and females and they all live_in the same world. &quot; For others , it is just personal preference . Amber Mooney , a sophomore at Brea Olinda , said that &quot; being in a school where there is nothing but girls would drive me nuts . I also believe it is important for the two sexes to intermingle so they will know how to relate to each other later in life. &quot; Angela Armen , a junior at Rosary admits , &quot; At co-ed schools , the guys are fun to have around . Like in class , they tend to add humor and jokes. &quot; Preston Turno , who attended all-male Servite and is now a junior at Brea Olinda , said he likes co-ed better because he ' d rather look_at girls all day than boys . Brea Olinda senior Cara Henson believes there are definite disadvantages to single-sex education . &quot; If a group of kids are in a single-sex school , they might be inclined to do their work more . But after a while , they might begin to be upset that the other sex isn ' t around and resent their school and spend more time_out of school with the opposite sex. &quot; * Most students interviewed seem to believe_in their school ' s system , whether it be coeducational or single sex , which suggests both types of students are benefiting from their particular system . There is no one answer in the debate over the merits of the types of schools , except perhaps that different students benefit from different environments , and for that reason there should be a variety of educational paths available .</TEXT>
