   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; NIGERIA MUST FACE THE MUSIC : ITS OIL MUST BE EMBARGOED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three months ago , a U.S. embargo against Nigerian oil imports was not even on the policy-option table . Today , this drastic , albeit overused , sanction is under serious consider ation as one of the remaining options the United States could pursue to dislodge the repressive military government of Nigerian Gen . Sani Abacha . Everything else -- cessation of foreign_aid , diplomatic castigation and outright threats -- has failed . The international community ' s apparent toleration of continuing human-rights abuses in Nigeria is incomprehensible . Nigeria is Africa ' s most populous nation . It has the potential of being both a regional and continental military power . Following Libya ' s decision to restrict its oil_production in 1973 , Nigeria became Africa ' s leading producer of petroleum . Since the Arab oil embargo in the ' 70s , it has consistently weighed in as the second- to fifth-largest supplier of crude_oil to the United States , accounting_for about 10 % to 18 % of U.S. imports . Petroleum and its related products account_for more_than 85 % of Nigeria ' s foreign earnings . There is a long history of foreign exploration and exploitation of Nigeria ' s oil reserves . Multinationals are present in a big way . Royal Dutch Shell , British Petroleum , Elf Aquitaine and Agip Francaise are among the major players . American oil_companies -- Chevron , Mobil , Texaco and Ashland -- provide the largest portion of fixed U.S. investment in Nigeria . Also , most of the major oil-field service and supply firms are doing business in Nigeria as well . In light of Nigeria ' s human-rights crisis , this cozy relationship between U.S. oil interests and the highly nationalized Nigerian oil_industry is especially disturbing . By omission , if not commission , the companies have traceably dirty hands in the repression of Nigeria ' s pro-democracy movement . Their connections to the government have been so close that Abacha gave them a special paean in his Aug . 17 address , in which he unilaterally suspended striking Nigerian oil unions . U.S. companies defensively assert that their interests are purely commercial . They claim that showing sympathy for the pro-democracy movement could result in retaliatory measures against them by the Nigerian government , to the advantage of British , French and Asian oil concerns . Good business , they say , means not interfering in Nigeria ' s internal affairs . This casuistry has provided a convenient cover_for their inaction in the face of brutal repression , but their continued acquiescence makes them as culpable as their Nigerian benefactors . Once it became clear that the Nigerian government was pursuing a program of corruption and tyranny , U.S. oil_companies could have reacted by becoming responsible corporate citizens . The industry should have recognized that it was in its own best interest to oppose Abacha . Not only would it have earned the goodwill of Nigeria ' s pro-democracy movement , the industry could have been a standard-bearer of responsible corporate conduct in the developing world . When the National Security_Council signaled that an embargo of Nigerian oil , perhaps accompanied by the freezing of Nigerian assets , may be in the offing , Abacha ' s reaction was typically arrogant : There are more American assets in Nigeria than the other way around . Thus , multilateral compliance with a U.S. embargo will be necessary to exert effective pressure on Abacha . One of the paradoxes of Nigeria ' s political crisis is that an oil embargo could be the one measure that preserves the country ' s valuable but fragile petroleum industry . Given the downward economic spiral caused in no small part by the government ' s corruption , repression and inefficiency , oil_production could see further declines . It may only be a matter of time before a pumping station or storage facility explodes , spreading substantial and , perhaps , irremediable financial_loss to the infrastructure and operation of foreign companies . If U.S. companies are not seen as part of the solution , they will be seen as part of the problem by the pro-democracy forces who , if left unattended , have no stake in the presence or profits of unsympathetic foreigners. *</TEXT>
