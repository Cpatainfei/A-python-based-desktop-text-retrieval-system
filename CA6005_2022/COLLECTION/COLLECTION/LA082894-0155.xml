   <HEADLINE> NRA ' S WISHES COME BEFORE THE VOTERS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Orange County congressional delegation unanimously voted against President Bill_Clinton ' s crime bill , which outlaws assault_rifles . No intelligent person could sanction the use of these weapons of war by anyone not in the military_services of the United States . You may just as well advocate murder ! As a Marine Corps night fighter_pilot in combat in three wars , I have fired more ordnance than most people have seen . As a federal prosecutor for five years , I am responsible_for sending felons to prison for sentences totaling 1 # 000 years . The cops , our front-line soldiers , who lay their lives on the line on every tour_of_duty , certainly deserve more_than our delegation gave them . It does no good to talk against crime and then vote for unrestricted instruments of slaughter on our streets . There is no lawful civilian use for an AK-47 or any of its progeny . Have they forgotten Stockton and the dead children ? The large contributions from the National Rifle Assn . and other right-wing military kook organizations should not direct legislation that encourages killing . WILLIAM A . DOUGHERTY Colonel , USMC ( retired ) Villa Park * Do Orange County voters really need any further evidence that their representatives in Washington cater far more to the wishes of ( demands of ) the National Rifle Assn . than of the people they are supposed to represent ? In spite of the fact that the overwhelming majority of the public , including those in Orange County , wanted the crime bill passed , they voted against it based on their lame excuse that it was loaded with pork . The only pork that will come_out of this crime bill will be the dollars that will be given to those who voted against it for their reelection campaigns . Wake_up Orange County voters ! Kick those rascals out of Congress once and for all ! JOHN M . CONCILIO Garden Grove</TEXT>
