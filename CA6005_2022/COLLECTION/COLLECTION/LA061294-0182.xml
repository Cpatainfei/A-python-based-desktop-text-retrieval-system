   <HEADLINE> CENTERS OF ATTENTION ; FOR THE KNICKS THERE ' S EWING , FOR THE ROCKETS THERE ' S OLAJUWON ; OTHER MATES ARE DISTANT SECOND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their recipe for success seems borrowed from a distant age , when winning a National Basketball Assn . title without leaning heavily on your center was as tricky as making an omlette without eggs . The New York Knicks and Houston Rockets are chasing this year ' s championship with an old-school formula . The big man , once again , is a big factor . For a while , he watched impatiently while the league turned_into a trendy smaller man ' s game . Leapers and three-point shooters and no-look passers reaped the NBA ' s ultimate reward while post play became secondary and post players became complimentary . Now , either the Knicks ' Patrick Ewing or the Rockets ' Hakeem Olajuwon will claim a ring later this month . Both are , by far , the best on their teams . There is Ewing and there is Olajuwon , and on those squads , every_other player falls_in_line a distant second . There hasn ' t been anything like this in a while . In fact , 16 years have passed since a center-dominated team won the NBA Finals . Make no mistake -- several great centers have won titles in that span . But they all had something in common . They all had tremendous teammates . Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish were surrounded by Hall_of_Fame help . Moses Malone didn ' t win until he joined Julius Erving . Wes Unseld had the Big E . You remove Ewing from the Knicks and Olajuwon from the Rockets , and you have the Sacramento Kings vs . the Washington Bullets . This much is evident : The game has evolved once again . The revolution of the cycle is complete . A few eras ago , teams were only as_good_as their pivotmen . Nobody won championships without Russells or Chamberlains or Reeds or Waltons . Then came was a lengthy drought when guards and forwards -- basketball ' s equivalent_to the welterweight division -- steered their teams to championships . Today , half of this year ' s serious championship contenders were center-oriented . And now , two have a chance to win a title . This was destined to happen , once the Magic-Bird-Jordan years were officially over . &quot; This history of basketball has always been marked by a big man leading his team , &quot; said Bill Walton , &quot; with a 16-year exception. &quot; Walton was the last of his kind , a center with tremendous responsibility on a championship team . He was complemented by worthy and capable role_players on the 1976-77 Portland Trail Blazers . They performed their specialized duties well enough . &quot; I was blessed with teammates who could catch my bad passes , &quot; Walton says modestly . But , truth is , everything hinged_on the performance of Walton . He had to play superbly throughout the championship round in_order for the Blazers to win . &quot; I wanted him to touch the ball on every possession , &quot; said Jack Ramsay , who coached that Blazer team . The Blazers ' entire offense was stamped with Walton ' s signature . The Blazers ran a constant motion offense , primarily because of Walton ' s passing skills , the best of any center before or since . He also had post-up and mid-range shooting ability , and was one of the better defenders of his time . The Blazers beat the Philadelphia 76ers in six games , claimed the title . . . and then the NBA developed a new identity for the next 16 years . Gradually , the skill positions began to dominate the scope . The impact of the center was lessened as the years passed . The Seattle SuperSonics won a championship based on backcourt play , with a clever point guard and a defensive-minded big guard . By the turn of the decade , Magic Johnson and Larry Bird suddenly were players that teams needed to win championships . You may argue that , in his rookie season , Johnson wasn ' t the focus of the Los Angeles Lakers . Abdul-Jabbar was . However , the Lakers would n ' t have beaten the Sixers for the 1979-80 title if not for Johnson . Abdul-Jabbar , victimized by a severely sprained ankle , didn ' t even suit up for the deciding game . Johnson assumed the major role , and his legendary Game 6 line -- 42 points , 15 rebounds and seven assists -- lifted the Lakers to glory . The purists could only satisfy themselves with one thing about that game : At least Magic played center that day . The rest of the ' 80s and the early ' 90s were noted for its complete blackout of the team-carrying center . The only center who came_closest to fitting that description was Malone . On sheer determination , he single-handedly led the Houston Rockets to the 1981 finals , where they challenged the Boston Celtics . that ' s when Malone uttered his famous quote , about how he &quot; and four guys from Petersburg , Virginia &quot; could whip the Celtics . He discovered that four Celtics and Bird were much better . In fact , Malone ' s title chase proved futile until he linked himself with Erving and took the ' 83 trophy . From there , the center ' s role on championship teams began to diminish , even on the great Celtic and Laker teams of the ' 80s . Bird was clearly the leader of the Celtics , and forward Kevin McHale was every bit as important as Parish . Abdul-Jabbar ' s impact decreased with age , to_the_point where he occasionally was the third option on the last two Laker championship teams . When the Celtic-Laker era ended , the Detroit Pistons won two consecutive titles with the three-guard rotation of Isiah Thomas , Joe Dumars and Vinnie Johnson , while center Bill Laimbeer was valued mainly for his intimidation and rebounding . Then the center was removed almost entirely from the last three NBA Finals , all won by the Chicago Bulls and the game ' s greatest player , Michael Jordan . What ' s especially noticeable about that period is that the Bulls didn ' t even face a team with an outstanding center in any championship series . They beat the Lakers and Vlade Divac , the Blazers and Kevin Duckworth , the Phoenix Suns and Mark West . &quot; The centers weren ' t as_good_as the other players in that time_period , &quot; Walton said . &quot; You win the championship with the best players , and for the most part , they weren ' t centers . They were the Isiah Thomases , the Birds and the Johnsons . &quot; You had a period_of_time when so many of the big men who came_into the league did so because they were big . They had to become good players. &quot; The game changed , too . It progressed from a half-court , ram-it-inside style to an up-tempo , fast-break pace that required athletes . Not many centers were built for baseline-to-baseline sprinting . The introduction of the three-point shot also placed a heavier value on the smaller man . All of a sudden , every position on the floor was important , not just the one in the middle . On some teams , the big man was the weak link . &quot; What really helped the smaller player was his shooting ability from the perimeter , &quot; Walton said . &quot; The game back in the ' 60s was built around centers because they took the easiest shots . The shooting percentages of other players were low . Now , smaller guys have developed_into great shooters . They began hitting the wide-open 20-footers , and you have to do that today or you ' re not in this league for long. &quot; When the playoffs began a month ago , center-dominated teams littered the field . There was Shaquille O ' Neal in Orlando , David Robinson in San Antonio and Dikembe Mutombo in Denver , along with Ewing and Olajuwon . With the exception of the first two , centers were the most visable and valuable players in the post-season . The youthful Nuggets were successful mostly because of Mutombo . His defensive presence was immense throughout the playoffs . He snuffed the team with the NBA ' s best regular-season mark by rejecting a record 31 shots by the SuperSonics . Then he put a scare into the Utah Jazz by disrupting their half-court style with 38 blocks , breaking his own record in the process . Mutombo invoked the same style that Bill Russell used during the Celtics ' run of championships in the ' 60s . He left the scoring to others while he concentrated_on the elements that produced the end result -- blocking shots , grabbing rebounds . The Suns , last year ' s Western Conference champion , were simply Hakreemed . While Charles Barkley disintegrated from back and groin injuries , Olajuwon produced 37 points and 13 rebounds and dusted off Phoenix in Game 7 of their semifinal series . As the same time , Ewing was busy helping the Knicks dispatch the Bulls , their nemesis of recent playoff years . With Jordan retired , Ewing was expected to push the Knicks past the Bulls , and that was accomplished after a struggle . &quot; I feel_like it ' s finally my time , &quot; Ewing said . Neither Ewing nor Olajuwon is blessed with a great point guard , and that ' s the most astonishing factor_in their ascent this season . Most centers , the good and not-so-good , usually require a decent point guard who can deliver the ball . The Rockets and Knicks have point guards by committee . Still , the lack of an outstanding point guard hasn ' t disrupted either center . One reason lies_with the perimeter shooting ability of both centers . When the lanes become clogged with the double- and triple-team defenses , both players can step outside and sink the 18-footer . Therefore , it ' s not necessary that they rely_on a point guard on every ball possession . More_than any other player , Ewing ' s championship chances were damaged by Jordan . Three times in the previous four seasons , Ewing and the Knicks were eliminated by the Bulls . All that changed with an October news_conference in suburban Chicago . When Jordan muttered two magical words -- &quot; I ' m retired &quot; -- Ewing ' s window of opportunity was pushed wide open . &quot; If Jordan was still here , he ' d carry the Bulls past New York and everyone else , &quot; said Pat Williams , the Orlando Magic president . &quot; He would not let his team lose to the Knicks , and once he reached the finals , Jordan was as unstoppable as anyone . So I ' d say , as much as anything else , Jordan ' s retirement will be responsible_for a great center winning this year ' s championship. &quot; The Rockets are completely built around Hakeem . The defensive attention he attracts makes_it easier on his teammates . He allows Vernon Maxwell and Kenny Smith to get open three-point shots . He enables forward Otis Thorpe to roam inside for rebounds . He had a chance to win an NBA championship before . But , like Ewing , he fell victim to one of the great non-centers of the ' 80s . Eight years ago , two Rocket centers -- Olajuwon and 7-foot-4 Ralph Sampson -- were not enough to overcome Bird . What has helped Olajuwon is his resiliency . Rather than try to beat Bird and Magic Johnson in their prime , Olajuwon simply outlasted them . And he actually became a better player during the waiting period , sharpening such skills as passing and jump-shooting to become the best player in the game . &quot; His game has developed over the years , &quot; Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said . &quot; It ' s amazing how far he ' s come . He was really pretty raw when he got_to America ( in 1980 ) , but now he ' s got the power and the quickness . He can beat you with the finesse game , going outside . He can play big , strong guys in the middle or drift out on a guard and use his quickness . It ' s really a great story about how far he ' s come. &quot; Not coincidently , Olajuwon became the first center to win the league ' s Most_Valuable_Player trophy since Malone in ' 82-83 . &quot; He ' s the best center this game has seen in quite a while , &quot; Ramsay said . &quot; He can do so many things to dominate a game . Olajuwon is incredible . You can ' t stop him . Teams will double him and he gets his shot off before the double comes . Or he ' s passing it out_to wide-open teammates . Olajuwon always finds a way to beat you. &quot; It would be only fitting for a dominant center to win this year ' s title . They have won everything else this season . Robinson claimed the scoring crown and became the first center to do so since Bob McAdoo nearly 20 years earlier . Robinson finished just ahead of O ' Neal . And in the MVP race , four of the top five vote-getters were centers , with Olajuwon finishing ahead of Robinson . The trend throughout the league this year was defense and half-court offense . Both aspects placed a heavier emphasis on center play . It ' s no surprise that the Knicks and Rockets excelled in the style that was favored by most teams this season . &quot; The game is really changing , &quot; said basketball TV analyst Doug Collins . &quot; You ' re not seeing as_many fast-breaks . You ' re seeing more possession basketball . The possibility of Patrick and Hakeem getting_together is exciting . You ' re seeing the big man start to become a major part of things again . With Magic , Bird and Isiah gone , we ' ve lost some of the most dominant creators on the perimeter in the last couple of years . Centers are taking their place. &quot;</TEXT>
