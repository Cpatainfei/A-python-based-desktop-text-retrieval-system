   <HEADLINE> FUGITIVE MEXICAN OFFICIAL FIGHTING EXTRADITION ; CRIME : FERNANDO HERNANDEZ , CHARGED IN $ 3-MILLION EMBEZZLEMENT , SPENT FIVE YEARS UNDETECTED IN CHULA VISTA . HE RAN AFOUL OF THE INS IN A VISA SCAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During almost five years on the run , a fugitive Mexican official accused of embezzling more_than $ 3 million lived comfortably in a suburban house guarded by security cameras a_few miles north of the border , according to federal_agents . Then Fernando Rodolfo Hernandez Martinez stumbled , authorities say . He applied for a special clergy visa to legalize his status , one of dozens of applicants who posed as ministers in an immigration scam broken_up by investigators this month . &quot; Not only were they not working_on Sundays , they were not men and women of the cloth , &quot; said Rudy Murillo , a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Now Baja California state prosecutors want to extradite Hernandez , 55 , on charges of engaging in a massive land fraud while he was manager of a state-run resort development . The INS is trying to deport him . The former official has asked_for political asylum on the grounds of government persecution in Mexico , a claim that Baja officials deny . &quot; There has been a charge pending since 1989 , &quot; said Gabriel Rosas Guzman , a spokesman for Baja Gov . Ernesto Ruffo Appel . &quot; The criminal case will proceed like any other. &quot; Shortly after Hernandez ' s arrest this month , his lawyer said the charges were false . The lawyer , George Siddell , has declined further comment . Hernandez will go before a U.S. immigration judge for a hearing this week . The case represents one strand of a web of scandal that brought_down former Baja Gov . Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera of Mexico ' s dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party in 1989 . Allegations of rampant corruption and incompetence forced Levya ' s resignation , helping to bring_about the historic election that year of Ruffo , the first governor from the opposition National Action Party . A subsequent investigation by Baja California authorities targeted Hernandez and more_than 20 other Leyva administration officials , including several who reportedly fled across the border . Mexican authorities alleged that as manager of San Antonio Del Mar , a state-run coastal development south of Tijuana , Hernandez sold properties to politically prominent cronies at undervalued prices and pocketed more_than $ 3 million . Hernandez owns a jewelry_store and real_estate in the San Diego area , authorities said , and he told investigators that he owns restaurants in Tijuana . He used a legal border-crossing card to enter the United States , Murillo said . Hernandez lived_in Chula Vista during much of the past five years and crossed back and forth into Baja occasionally despite his fugitive status , according to Jeff Casey , a U.S. Customs Service official . Customs conducted a brief investigation , but it was closed because too_much time has passed to trace the embezzled funds , Casey said . INS agents ran_across Hernandez ' s name recently while investigating a scam in which a Pentecostal minister charged at least 82 illegal immigrants up_to $ 4 # 000 apiece . The applicants posed as assistant pastors of a small barrio church to obtain special expedited visas granted to foreign clergy . Realizing that Hernandez was wanted in Mexico , agents arrested him Feb . 10 at a house registered to his mother . &quot; We got_out there and the house had security cameras . We sensed immediately a lot of security , &quot; Murillo said . &quot; But he did come_to the door . He was pretty talkative and forthright. &quot; Hernandez admitted paying $ 4 # 000 for the bogus visa application and asked_for political asylum , Murillo said . Mexicans in the United States rarely gain asylum , which is granted in cases of fear of persecution based on political affiliation or other grounds . Hernandez will be deported if his petition is denied .</TEXT>
