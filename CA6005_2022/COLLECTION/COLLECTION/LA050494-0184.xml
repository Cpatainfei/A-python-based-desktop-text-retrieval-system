   <HEADLINE> CLINTON BIDS FOR FRIENDLY N . KOREAN TIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton delivered an impassioned appeal Tuesday night to North_Korea and its people to turn_back from the increasingly ominous confrontation over international inspection of nuclear sites . Even as senior Administration officials have stepped_up warnings that the issue could lead to crisis and even conflict , Clinton used a worldwide television broadcast to assure the Korean people that the United States continues to hope for a peaceful solution . &quot; I believe we have North_Koreans watching us tonight , &quot; Clinton said , and &quot; I say to you : The United States wishes to have friendly and open relationships with you . We wish to have a constructive relationship . We want you to have a constructive relationship with South_Korea . . . . &quot; The options are , I think , clear , but they are not easy , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; No one wishes this confrontation . But neither does one wish to have a state not only with nuclear_power but with a capacity to proliferate nuclear_weapons to other nations . It is a very serious potential situation. &quot; Clinton ' s appeal_to the North_Koreans was part of a larger effort to use an unusual worldwide television broadcast on the Cable News Network to restore luster to his image as a foreign_policy leader . Faced with widespread criticism that he has been hesitant and inconsistent , the President insisted he is prepared to maintain the American leadership role -- even in messy post-Cold War conflicts such_as North_Korea , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Haiti and Rwanda . Clinton ' s statements on North_Korea paralleled those made earlier on Tuesday by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , who told Pyongyang the United States is ready to provide substantial economic aid if it agrees to drop its nuclear_weapons program . But Perry also sought to warn Americans that U.S. insistence on Pyongyang ' s compliance with international nuclear_weapons inspections also contained the risk of &quot; consequences &quot; that might provoke North_Korea into military_action against the South . Describing his &quot; road map &quot; for national security and foreign affairs , Clinton acknowledged that American involvement in overseas conflicts &quot; costs money and it costs lives. &quot; And , he said , &quot; we cannot solve every problem , nor should we. &quot; Yet the United States &quot; must be willing to assume the perils and the risk of leadership , &quot; he declared . &quot; And I am willing to do that. &quot; Fielding questions from correspondents representing news organizations from about 100 countries , Clinton made these points : * China : Taking a middle course , he said Beijing had met some American demands on human_rights but had fallen_short on enough others that ending most-favored-nation trade status for China is &quot; clearly on the table &quot; and still &quot; a possibility. &quot; &quot; I do not seek , nor would it be proper , for the United States or for any other nation to tell a great nation like China how to conduct all its internal affairs or to treat all its citizens or what laws it should have . That would be wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; The criteria in the executive order I issued are those things recognized in all universal declarations by all countries as essential to human rights. &quot; * Bosnia : He angrily defended his policies against charges that he had &quot; flip-flopped , &quot; asserting he had done everything he could in the face of European opposition to more aggressive action . Asked by CNN ' s Christian Amanpour , from Sarajevo , whether his cautious stance in Bosnia had prompted North_Korea to take Washington less seriously , a nettled Clinton shot back : &quot; No , but speeches like that make them take me less seriously than I ' d like to be taken . &quot; There have been no constant flip-flops , madam , &quot; he declared . * Middle_East : Asked what signs of progress he saw in negotiations between Israel and Syria , he said Syrian President Hafez Assad has shown new flexibility . * Rwanda : He said the world &quot; has grieved for the slaughter in Rwanda &quot; but stopped well short of pledging direct American military intervention . He said the United States will join other nations in helping Rwandan refugees .</TEXT>
