   <HEADLINE> FUGITIVE IN MURDER CASE ARRIVES TO FACE CHARGES ; CRIME : RICHARD LEOS , ACCUSED IN 1975 INCIDENT , WAIVES EXTRADITION FROM SEATTLE . HE IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT AIRPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise move , fugitive Richard Leos waived extradition Wednesday and was flown from Seattle to Los Angeles to face murder_charges in a Pacoima barroom slaying he allegedly committed 19 years ago before disappearing under a variety of fake identities . Arriving_at Burbank Airport just after 5:30 p.m. , Leos , handcuffed , was whisked through the airport and into a waiting police_car to be held for arraignment , which could come as early as today . Casually dressed in a turquoise shirt , Leos , 42 , smiled broadly as he was led through airport passageways clogged with travelers . He said little , except that he was not the killer who authorities say blasted a man in the head with a shotgun in 1975 when the victim refused to cooperate with robbers in a Pacoima bar . &quot; I didn ' t do_it , &quot; Leos said softly . &quot; that ' s enough said. &quot; Leos , also known as Jess or Jessie Caruso , waived extradition at a preliminary hearing before a judge in Seattle . Had he fought the request , it could have taken Los Angeles prosecutors as long as three months to get custody of Leos from Washington state authorities . &quot; It really took us by surprise , &quot; said Detective Ray Broker , a homicide investigator in the LAPD Foothill Division , who attended the hearing . &quot; He said there ' s no sense in fighting it . He said he wants to face the charges. &quot; Leos was arrested last week by an interagency fugitive task_force based in Washington state , after Los Angeles police determined that he was living_in a Seattle suburb under a false identity , with a common-law wife and her two grown daughters . Leos faces charges of murder , armed robbery and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution . If convicted , he could be sentenced to life in prison without parole . It was Broker , authorities said , who followed up a tip to end Leos ' nearly two decades as a fugitive , under various aliases , in the United States and Mexico . Broker and Los Angeles Police Detective Rick Plows were at the preliminary hearing in Seattle on Wednesday as part of the LAPD ' s continuing investigation into the case , and they immediately took custody of him and flew back . Broker said the detectives plan to fly back to the Seattle area to see if they can find information to bolster their case against him , and perhaps find the two alleged accomplices that authorities say were with Leos during the holdup . Authorities say they can produce a witness who knew Leos and was in the bar when the shooting occurred , who can testify that Leos was the killer . Leos ' common-law wife said Wednesday that he has called her every day from jail , maintaining his innocence while declining to discuss with her specifics of the case . &quot; He is innocent , &quot; said Ginger Rosendale . &quot; They are going_to have to prove everything . He ' s told me he doesn ' t know why they are taking him down. &quot; Rosendale said Leos waived extradition so he can confront the charges against him in court . &quot; He isn ' t fighting it , &quot; she said . &quot; He is just getting_on_with it , to clear this thing up. &quot;</TEXT>
