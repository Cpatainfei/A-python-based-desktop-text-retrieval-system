   <HEADLINE> RETRO ; SINGING AUTRY ' S PRAISES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Folks nowadays may think_of Gene Autry as owner of the California Angels or a museum namesake , but he was Hollywood ' s first &quot; singing cowboy &quot; and one of Tinseltown ' s biggest movie_stars . Autry , 87 , is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Gene Autry : Melody of the West , &quot; premiering Sunday on AMC during the cable network ' s Second Annual Film Preservation Festival . AMC also will air restored copies of Autry ' s only Technicolor films , &quot; The Big Sombrero &quot; and &quot; The Strawberry Roan. &quot; The one-hour documentary is narrated by country great Johnny Cash , who happens to be a huge Autry fan . Also featured are reflections from Autry ; actress Ann Rutherford , who received her first on-screen kiss from Autry ; actress Gail Davis , TV ' s &quot; Annie Oakley &quot; ; stuntman-actor Richard Farnsworth ; Dick Jones , Autry ' s frequent co-star ; country legend Patsy Montana , and Autry ' s musical sidekicks , &quot; The Cass County Boys &quot; ( Fred Martin and Jerry Scoggins ) . Producer-director Len Morris hopes to &quot; bring Autry back for audiences who did experience that popularity and enjoyed those films . We are also trying to introduce them to a new audience who would n ' t have had that experience . And we are trying to explain why he was so hugely popular. &quot; Autry , whose career has spanned 60 years , was working as a telegraph_operator at a railroad depot in Oklahoma when the great humorist Will Rogers heard him sing and encouraged him to give show_biz a try . Autry began his career in 1928 , performing cowboy songs on the radio . By 1931 , he had his own show . Coming_out to Los Angeles , he starred in Mascot Pictures ' bizarre 1934 serial &quot; Phantom Empire , &quot; Hollywood ' s first and only singing Western / sci-fi adventure . He made his feature debut the next year in 1935 ' s &quot; Tumblin ' Tumbleweeds , &quot; With his comic sidekick Smiley Burnette and his horse Champion , Autry made 94 Westerns for Republic and Columbia Pictures and starred in the 1950-56 TV series &quot; The Gene Autry Show. &quot; He also made 635 recordings ; he wrote or co-wrote more_than 200 . His records have sold more_than 50 million copies , including the first certified gold record ( &quot; The Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine &quot; ) recognizing sales of more_than a_million copies . And these days his Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum is a popular Los Angeles tourist attraction . Morris believes audiences have loved Autry for many reasons . &quot; I think it was the voice , &quot; he says . &quot; It was not the first time a radio personality had made movies , but since cowboys were going_to sing , it was going_to help to have a real musician . People forget that Gene Autry is a musician of considerable gifts . He brought that and the popularity of his radio career and his recordings to the movies . Cowboys had sung before -- John Wayne even sang , but it was just beyond awful . Gene could sing. &quot; Beyond that , Morris says , there was Autry himself . &quot; There was something boy-next-door , something very trustworthy , something very reassuring about him . He had principles that he stood_up for . He wasn ' t cynical. &quot; And audiences of all ages responded . &quot; You ' ve got_to keep coming_back to Gene Autry , &quot; Morris says . &quot; As Gene Autry would say , ' If it were easy , everybody would be doing it. ' Many other people tried to do_it and only Roy Rogers succeeded . It comes_down to the individual and how people sitting in their seats and buying tickets perceived him . They perceived Gene Autry as concerned -- concerned about them. &quot; &quot; Gene Autry : Melody of the West &quot; premieres Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on AMC . &quot; The Big Sombrero &quot; airs Sunday at 7:30 a.m. ; &quot; The Strawberry Roan &quot; airs Sunday at 9 a.m. MUSEUM IS THE ' FULFILLMENT OF MY DREAM ' Though Gene Autry was not available for an interview , he did respond by fax to several questions about his life and career . What do you see as your legacy as a cowboy movie_star ? For over 60 years , my 93 movies , 91 TV movies and 650 recordings and 16 years of the &quot; Melody Ranch Radio Show &quot; entertained several generations of kids and their parents . I deeply appreciate the loyalty of my fans and thank them from the bottom of my heart for their support all_of these years . To give something back -- with the wonderful help of my wife , Jackie Autry , and Joanne Hale -- we built the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles ' Griffith Park , which is an accredited historical and education museum showing the history of the American Western from the days of the Conquistadors to the modern cowboy , as well as Hollywood ' s history of Western movies . ... it is the fulfillment of my dream in leaving a legacy for my fans , young and old . How do you feel about the resurgence of Western films on the Hollywood screen today ? The first &quot; story &quot; movie was the 1903 &quot; The Great Train Robbery , &quot; a Western , and there have been Western movies ever since . The Western was the backbone of the film_industry for 60 years , and in the late ' 30s and early ' 40s , as_many as 200 Westerns were produced in a year . It is logical that there would be a resurgence of the Western -- all it needed were some good ones like &quot; Dances With Wolves , &quot; &quot; Unforgiven , &quot; TV ' s &quot; Lonesome Dove &quot; and more . GENE AUTRY ' S COWBOY CODE A cowboy never takes unfair advantage -- even with an enemy . A cowboy never betrays a trust . A cowboy always tells the truth . A cowboy is kind to children , old folks and animals . A cowboy is free from racial or religious prejudices . A cowboy is helpful and , when anyone ' s in_trouble , lends a hand . A cowboy is a good worker . A cowboy is clean in_person , thought , word and deed . A cowboy represents womanhood , parents and laws of the country . A cowboy is a patriot .</TEXT>
