   <HEADLINE> BENTSEN PREDICTS INTEREST_RATES WILL RISE IN ' 94 ; ECONOMY : THE TREASURY_SECRETARY ' S COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION would n ' t FIGHT A FED MOVE TO TIGHTEN MONEY_SUPPLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a signal that the Clinton_Administration is prepared to accept at least some brakes on the nation ' s economic recovery , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen predicted Wednesday that the economy will have to weather a period of higher interest_rates and declining stock prices in 1994 . His remarks suggest that the Administration , which had hoped that low interest_rates would continue to feed the recovery through 1994 , now believes there will be some economic speed_bumps along the way . Even so , Bentsen said the Administration expects the recovery to remain on track and unemployment to subside this year . Discussing the economic outlook with a small group of reporters , Bentsen said it appears likely that there will be a modest increase in short-term interest_rates and that stock_markets will experience a downward correction . He did not predict that the Federal_Reserve_Board will orchestrate the interest_rate increase as part of its mission to keep inflation in check , but the Fed has broad power to influence short-term rates . While Bentsen ' s comments echoed the forecasts of many private analysts , it is unusual for a Treasury_secretary to predict such developments . Among other things , his comments served as a signal that the Administration would not argue against a Fed decision to push interest_rates higher . He did not take credit on behalf of the Administration for the decline in interest_rates that has sent them to their lowest levels since Lyndon B . Johnson was President , or for a drop_in inflation , which he said is now at an &quot; acceptable &quot; level . At a rate of 2.8 % , he said , inflation is at its lowest level in 28 years . But he did say these developments are attributable , at least to some degree , to the Administration ' s efforts to tackle the budget_deficit . The Administration has put_forward a plan intended to trim $ 500 billion from the deficit over five years . Bentsen also chided Japan for not doing more to stimulate its ailing economy . &quot; Japan , with its huge trade surplus , cannot look_to the United States and other countries to make_up for slack demand at_home , &quot; he said in a speech intended to give the Administration a pat on the back for its first-year economic performance and to send a signal of confidence in the future . He acknowledged that the U.S. interest in a growing domestic market in Japan is based on the need to build overseas consumption of U.S. products . And , in a comment that set_off a small flurry in currency markets , Bentsen said that meddling with the exchange_rate of the yen -- allowing it to fall_in value in_relation_to the dollar to make Japanese products more competitive in the United States , for example -- is not a course favored in Washington . &quot; Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way_out of recession for Japan , &quot; he said . The dollar rose to 112.90 yen , up from 112.60 on Tuesday , after falling earlier in trading in Tokyo . The dollar was mixed against other currencies . Some analysts attributed a rise in interest_rates Wednesday to apprehension in the market over Bentsen ' s comments . The Treasury ' s key 30-year bond yield rose to 6.40 % from Tuesday ' s 6.34 % . Bentsen addressed the Administration ' s 1993 economic efforts in two separate forums , first with reporters invited to his conference_room and then in a speech at the Brookings Institution , a public policy research organization . &quot; I want to see that the Administration gets some credit for it , &quot; Bentsen told reporters , reflecting the political sensitivity attached_to the role that a successful economic recovery is likely to play in President Clinton ' s political fortunes . In addition to low interest and inflation_rates , he cited positive signs that include a &quot; booming &quot; stock_market , falling unemployment , increases in productivity , lowered business debt and greater business equity . Predicting more of the same for 1994 , he said : &quot; I ' d like to see us achieve a solid 3 % real growth and hold inflation to approximately 3 % . This should allow interest_rates to remain relatively low and reduce further the unemployment_rate . . . . It ' s been a good first year -- solid , steady , non-inflationary growth -- and we ' re planning to sustain this one. &quot; But asked whether he agrees with the assessment of private analysts that 1994 would see a correction in the stock_market , he said , &quot; That would not surprise me. &quot; Still , he added that he did not expect any such drop to become &quot; so major as_to slow_down the growth of business. &quot; Asked whether he anticipates any move to boost interest_rates in the first_quarter of the year , he said the Administration assumes &quot; there will be a modest increase in short-term rates. &quot; But he took_care not to say when it would occur or how long it would last .</TEXT>
