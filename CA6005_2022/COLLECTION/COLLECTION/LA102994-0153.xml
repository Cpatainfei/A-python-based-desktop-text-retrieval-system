   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN LEGISLATORS OK TESTING OF FOREIGNERS FOR AIDS VIRUS ; HEALTH : VOTE IN THE LOWER HOUSE IS NEARLY UNANIMOUS . BUT ACTIVISTS CALL THE BILL COSTLY , DISCRIMINATORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s lower house of Parliament voted 247-1 Friday to require all foreigners who visit Russia to be tested for the virus that causes AIDS . The bill , which sailed_through the Duma on its second_reading over the strenuous objections of AIDS activists , must still be passed_by the upper house of Parliament and signed by President Boris N . Yeltsin . But if it becomes law , the measure will require those coming_to Russia for &quot; work or study or other purposes &quot; either to be tested for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , or to present a medical certificate showing that they are HIV-negative . Foreign residents of Russia who test positive for the virus could be deported . AIDS activists , doctors and even an official in the Health Ministry criticized the measure Friday , saying it is costly and discriminatory , makes a travesty of medical privacy and violates international human_rights conventions that Russia has signed . Worse , they say , it will do nothing to stop the spread of AIDS in Russia . &quot; This might have been effective before , when Russians did not go abroad so_much , &quot; said Nikolai Nedzelsky of the Russian Names Fund , which helps HIV-positive people . &quot; Now many Russians are going overseas . . . . It ' s useless. &quot; AIDS activist Kevin J . Gardner , co-founder of the Moscow-based Aesop Center , which has lobbied against the bill , called the measure &quot; utterly unrealistic. &quot; &quot; AIDS is a convenient tool for . . . slamming foreigners and blaming them for the ills of Russian society , &quot; Gardner said . He argued that the money needed to test foreigners would be_better spent on AIDS education programs , which are scanty here . The head of the Duma health_care committee that sponsored the bill , Bella A . Denisenko , has in the past called the testing of foreigners &quot; a matter of state security. &quot; &quot; We should erect a civilized barrier against infected foreigners coming_in , &quot; she said in June , when the bill was approved on its first_reading , according to the Moscow Times newspaper . &quot; Those who don ' t want AIDS incidence in Russia to reach the level of Western nations should vote for the bill , &quot; she said . Russia has so far been spared the worst ravages of the AIDS epidemic , although public health officials have said that skyrocketing rates of sexually transmitted diseases and widespread public disdain for condom use are likely harbingers of an AIDS explosion to come . As of Aug . 15 , 740 Russian citizens and 450 foreigners were officially listed as infected with HIV , and 110 people had died of AIDS . Activists say the real_numbers are much higher , because many people who suspect they may be infected try to avoid contact with the Russian public health system . &quot; Discrimination occurs in 99 % of cases &quot; when HIV-positive patients are entered into the official roster , Nedzelsky said . Today , Russians are routinely tested for HIV without their knowledge or consent , and sometimes people who test positive for the virus are not informed of the results or are told they have another disease , such_as hepatitis-B , he said . Those who do test positive are often shunned , dismissed from their jobs or forced to move to another city , Nedzelsky said . The name_and_address of one AIDS patient in Siberia was broadcast by a local radio_station , he said . And doctors in a Moscow suburb recently telephoned the parents of a 25-year-old man to inform them that their son had tested positive for HIV and was being sent to an AIDS clinic in the city , he said . The new AIDS bill contains a clause that bans discrimination against HIV-infected people . &quot; It ' s a very good clause , but there is no mechanism for its implementation , and it doesn ' t say what happens if people do discriminate , &quot; Nedzelsky said . Similarly , the bill &quot; guarantees &quot; free medical treatment for AIDS victims , but desperately underfunded Russian hospitals lack the money , medicines and expertise to make_good on such a promise , he said . Under a Soviet-era AIDS law , foreigners could be required to undergo testing . The law was applied sporadically , however , and usually against Africans , foreign students and some foreign workers . Infected people have been deported . &quot; This creates a false sense of security among Russians , &quot; said Irina Savelyeva of Aesop . &quot; They believe that AIDS is connected only with foreigners , and without foreigners they will be safe. &quot; The AIDS activists said they had not seen the final version of Friday ' s bill ; Nedzelsky said lawmakers had refused to give it to them . But a recent draft of the bill contained a clause that would allow authorities to test anyone deemed at risk of spreading HIV , Gardner said . &quot; The phrase is so unclear it could be taken_to mean anyone -- or whoever the authorities decide to target , &quot; he said . &quot; If someone comes_in_for dental treatment , for example , and the dental worker thinks the person looks_like a homosexual or a prostitute , the worker could demand that the person be tested or have a certificate. &quot; The law would probably create a lucrative black_market for fake medical certificates for those who are HIV-positive or who do not wish to be tested , he said . Vadim Pokrovsky , the chief AIDS expert at the Health Ministry , said mandatory testing should be required only of blood_donors . He expressed fears that lawmakers are moving toward allowing universal mandatory testing .</TEXT>
