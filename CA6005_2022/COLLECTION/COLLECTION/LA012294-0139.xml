   <HEADLINE> SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE : IT ' S TIME FOR SLUMPING KITT TO TAKE FOOT OFF THE BRAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So , who wants to tell the downhill racer that he needs to go faster ? You think AJ Kitt doesn ' t know ? Kitt spits speed . Once , he described -- in what he considered layman ' s terms -- the sensation of going 60 m.p.h. down the side of a mountain . &quot; Say you ' re in a car with four other people , going 120 m.p.h. , &quot; Kitt said , as if people routinely did this sort of thing . &quot; Everyone shuts_up , everyone grabs a handle , everybody starts thinking_about their safety and everybody starts concentrating_on what ' s ahead , including the driver . In that way , you ' re almost in your own little world. &quot; Kitt began the season as perhaps America ' s best hope for an Olympic medal in Alpine skiing . He was in his own little world . He kicked_down the downhill door last year and established himself as an international star , despite winding_up with little to show for it . Kitt led the first World Cup downhill at Val d ' Isere , France , before it was canceled because of weather . He led the Aspen downhill before it was canceled , unjustly by judges , because of a small hole in the course . Kitt did get_to keep the bronze medal he won at the World Championships , a race he could have won except for one minor technical glitch . Despite some setbacks , Kitt , 25 , seemed poised to pounce on this Olympic season . His climb through the U.S. ski team ranks had been methodical and calculated . His career course was steady , not spectacular , until he cracked the World Cup scene with two top-10 finishes in 1990 . Then , in 1992 at Val d ' Isere , Kitt became the first American to win a World Cup downhill since Bill Johnson in 1984 . That year Kitt also finished second at the famed Hahnenkamm at Kitzbuehel , Austria , and ninth in the Olympic downhill at Albertville . But the weeks leading to the Lillehammer Games have been strangely quiet for Kitt , who has watched teammate Tommy Moe surpass him as America ' s speed king . Moe advances toward Lillehammer with the necessary momentum , confident of his medal chances_on the slopes at Kvitfjell , Norway . While Moe has been king of the_hill , Kitt has been mostly been middle of the pack . Moe ranks sixth in the World Cup downhill standings . Kitt is 22nd . Last weekend , Moe shined_at Kitzbuehel , finishing eighth in the downhill and fourth in the combined . Kitt was 33rd in downhill . Kitt is not skiing horribly -- he has 11th- and 13th-place finishes -- but ho-hum performances were not what he had_in_mind when he began what he believed would be a dominating season . To set the tone , Kitt even shaved his head before the first race . But he has been anything but razor sharp . U.S. ski team officials insist there is nothing physically wrong with Kitt . Quite the contrary . &quot; AJ ' s in great shape , &quot; Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , said recently . &quot; He ' s in fantastic shape . He ' s skiing technically well in races , but there ' s been some inconsistency there with AJ. &quot; Major maintains that Kitt ' s problems might stem from his overzealous workout regimen last summer , when he hired a personal trainer and doubled his summer off-season skiing days from 25 to 50 . Major warned Kitt that such a drastic departure from the norm might affect his early-season results . &quot; If you dramatically increase your sports-specific training , you expect to have a downfall in your results , &quot; Major said . &quot; I told him , ' Expect to not have a good December , but then the results will pick_up after that. ' &quot; But Kitt has yet to show improvement . He finished 31st at Bormio , Italy , on Dec . 29 , 13th at Saalbach , Austria , on Jan . 6 and 33rd at Kitzbuehel . The race to Lillehammer heats_up considerably in the next few weeks , with three downhills scheduled before the men ' s Olympic downhill Feb . 13 . Moe and Kitt -- who take their rivalry seriously -- take their shots this weekend in another big race at Wengen , Switzerland . Moe , younger at 23 , is king for now , but he doesn ' t underestimate his rival . &quot; AJ definitely has been in the spotlight for the U.S. for the last couple of years , and I think he was a good mentor for me because I had somebody to chase , &quot; he said recently . But even Moe doesn ' t know what ' s wrong with Kitt . &quot; It ' s hard to say , &quot; Moe said . &quot; He can click at any time , too , and pop into the top three . He ' s definitely got_to get his act together a little bit more right now . I ' m just kind of on a roll , and I have a lot of confidence going right now . I think AJ is definitely skiing well , but now I think I ' m the top guy. &quot; Ski Notes The U.S. men ' s giant slalom team , which had not scored a World Cup point all season , finally cracked the top 30 when Jeremy Nobis placed 28th in a recent race . Only the top 30 finishers are awarded World Cup points . . . . After much outrage and confusion , the International Ski Federation ( FIS ) at last canceled a women ' s super-giant slalom raced two Saturdays ago at Altenmarkt , Austria . Twenty-six of the first 32 skiers crashed in the finish area . The race was halted , but results were later made official by the FIS despite its own rule that disallows any race in which half of the competitors do not start . Less than half the field raced at Altenmarkt , and it took the FIS only a week to figure it out . Tommy Moe ' s fourth-place finish in the combined at Kitzbuehel was the highest for an American since 1984 , when Phil Mahre took third . . . . Hilary Lindh , defending 1992 Olympic silver medalist , is charging after a slow start and ranks eighth overall in World Cup downhill , with Picabo Street 13th . Heidi Voelker ranks seventh in giant slalom , with Eva Twardokens ninth . Southern California ski areas that are open report no earthquake damage to roads leading into the mountains . And , though there is no natural snow to speak_of , skiing is said to be surprisingly good because of cool nighttime temperatures and sophisticated snow-making capabilities . . . . Mountain High East and West are open and offer night skiing daily . The Big Bear resorts are also in full operation . Snow Summit is operating 10 lifts and night skiing . Bear Mountain has 32 groomed trails available and Snow Valley has 23 trails and seven lifts open . Mt . Baldy has closed and will not reopen until the next significant snowfall . Forecasters are projecting that a series of storms will pass_through Southern California , beginning this weekend . Spokesman John Koulouris said Mt . Baldy could reopen soon after the first storm .</TEXT>
