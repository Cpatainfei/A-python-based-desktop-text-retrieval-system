   <HEADLINE> RESEARCHER SCAVENGES ANCIENT HUMAN BONES FOR ANSWERS ON DNA ; BACTERIA : OTHER REMAINS , INCLUDING GUTS AND FECES , ARE EXAMINED BY PALEOMICROBIOLOGISTS SEEKING INSIGHTS INTO EPIDEMICS AND AILMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After 25 years of surgery , Dr. Mark Spigelman left his patients in Australia to look_after a much older clientele here . About 1 # 500 years older , in fact . The surgeon-turned-sleuth scours remains of human bones , guts and feces searching for bits of bacterial DNA . These remnants from long-dead bacteria , he believes , will provide one of the most accurate pictures of medical_history and may also offer clues to understand current epidemics . Scientists still do not understand the ebb and flow of germs -- why the same bug can wipe_out a community one year and barely cause illness the next . The answer may lurk in the genes and how they slowly mutate over time . &quot; We are giving a handle to a lot of historical diseases , but there is also the practical_application . I ' ve always felt that a lot of problems of modern diseases lay_in ancient times , &quot; said Spigelman . He was surrounded by boxes of human bones and glass cases of skulls in an office at the Institute of Archaeology . Some of the research has important implications outside medicine . A team at the University of Minnesota retrieved TB from a 1 # 000-year-old Peruvian mummy , a finding that suggests Columbus has been wrongly accused of bringing the disease to the Americas . Spigelman is one of a small but growing group of scientists worldwide studying genes from ancient germs . The fledgling field , called paleomicrobiology , involves an eclectic group of researchers , including archeologists , pathologists , microbiologists and , in Spigelman ' s case , a surgeon with a penchant for the past . &quot; I wanted to learn archeology , not medical_history , because I ' m a surgeon , a hands-on man , &quot; said Spigelman . He displayed a vial of ancient feces -- now looking more like sand -- that he collected recently at a dig_in Israel . &quot; This stuff to me is even more important than bones , &quot; he said . &quot; Bone is from an individual , but when you go_into the toilet it ' s like a community roll_call for disease. &quot; DNA scavengers have no intention of reincarnating microbes from yesteryear , building a microscopic &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Their goal is threefold : to verify historical theories about how infections have spread , to provide insight into current diseases and perhaps to shed_light_on the origin of some species , such_as tuberculosis or leprosy . The scraps of DNA lurking in human remains are far from enough raw_material to create a bug . They are more like fingerprints that scientists examine to identify a particular microbe . &quot; Up until now you were only able to look_at ancient diseases by the impact on the growth of bone . A lot of illnesses kill too soon , before it impacts bone , or they don ' t have an impact on bones at all , &quot; said Dr. Martin Jones , a professor of archeological science at Cambridge_University . Jones also heads Britain ' s Ancient Biomolecules Initiative . So far , most of Spigelman ' s research has been_on bones , which seems to be the best for preserving DNA . Typically , Spigelman fetches the bones from digs_in England and Israel and brings them to his collaborators in the department of microbiology at the University of London . &quot; What we ' ve really done is apply modern diagnostic clinical techniques to the ancient bone , &quot; said Dr. Helen Donahue , one of the microbiologists . Within the last 10 years , scientists realized that bacterial DNA can survive centuries , escaping enzymes that degrade the rest of the human_body . At the same time , researchers devised a technique , called polymerase chain_reaction , or PCR , that amplifies DNA so it can be studied more easily . Donahue and her colleagues X-ray bones to zero_in on where the germ seemed to do its damage , the most likely spot for hunting its DNA . Then they jab the bone with a sharp needle and retrieve a sample , perhaps half a gram . Using chemicals that clean off excess proteins , they isolate the DNA and then amplify using PCR , comparing the pattern of genes to the known pattern of the incriminated germ . The pattern looks_like lines of ink blots . So far , Spigelman said he ' s retrieved genes of E . coli , a gut bacteria , from a bog man dating to AD 500 , tuberculosis DNA from ancient bones and leprosy DNA from a bone dating to 600 BC . The TB findings were published last year in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology and the leprosy study in a letter in a recent issue of the Lancet , a medical journal . Other experts said the research may be an important step_forward but the findings need to be confirmed , particularly because the group did not do any gene sequencing -- identifying the precise order of the DNA -- to validate their preliminary findings . Dr. Svante Paabo , a pioneering DNA hunter and professor of biology at University of Munich , said gene sequencing -- identifying the precise order of DNA -- is crucial because PCR can sometimes gives false results . If confirmed , the findings would provide yet another step_forward in a lengthy trail of chasing the bacterial culprits , Paabo said . ' It ' s extremely interesting if one can go_back and look_at the evolution of pathogens and see how rapidly they change_over time , &quot; Paabo said . If it turns_out that some genes don ' t change_over time , they could be targeted by new drugs or vaccines , he said .</TEXT>
