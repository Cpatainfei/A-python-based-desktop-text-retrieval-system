   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : SOUTHEAST : SOUTH GATE ; CITY_MANAGER ' S ROLE IN ELECTION CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City_Manager Todd W . Argow implemented unusual , and potentially unethical , procedures that may have favored incumbents during the recent City_Council election , said Acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller . In a Feb . 2 memo , Argow instructed all department_heads to &quot; remember that our loyalties lie_with the existing &quot; City_Council members and ordered them to inform him when council candidates requested information or documents on city policies and projects . If the incumbents benefited from Argow ' s efforts , the results of the election did not seem to reflect it -- two of the three on the ballot were defeated . Still , Argow ' s order potentially muddied what should be an atmosphere of neutrality at City_Hall during an election , Miller said . &quot; It does raise the specter of impropriety to the extent that it implies that the city employees should be other_than neutral , &quot; Miller said . &quot; In the election business , the appearance ( of impropriety ) is very important in undermining the integrity of the process to the public . I ' m not aware of anything criminal , but it does raise one ' s eyebrows. &quot; Argow said he regrets using the word loyalties , but he defended his memo as a reminder to his staff to continue serving the council with gusto despite the additional pressures of an election . City Clerk Nina Banuelos said Argow bypassed standard procedure by instructing his staff to handle information requests that are usually funneled through her office . Banuelos asserted that another of Argow ' s policies may have given incumbents an unfair advantage . In a second document , an internal weekly update to select city officials and council_members , it is clear that Argow ordered city staffers to inform council incumbents when their opponents requested information and the nature of that information . &quot; As promised , we are keeping you informed of requests for information which staff receives from council candidates , &quot; states the Feb . 17 newsletter . Argow said he allowed department_heads to expedite information requests to cut_down on bureaucracy during the election . Providing summaries of the requests to the City_Council was a way to keep the council &quot; informed , to let them know what the public interest is and what the staff workload is . . . and where the demands are coming from. &quot; The city clerk , as the city ' s election official , should be involved with any election-related matters , Banuelos said , adding that her office is the official clearinghouse for document requests . Providing incumbents with summaries of information requested by opponents gives them ammunition that challengers do not have , she said . Incumbents Johnny Ramirez and Larry Leonard lost their seats to Bill Martinez and Henry Gonzalez . Mary Ann Buckles was reelected to her second term . Gonzalez , who said he had difficulty obtaining city documents during the election , said he believes Argow ' s policy was improper and gave incumbents an unfair advantage . MARY HELEN BERG</TEXT>
