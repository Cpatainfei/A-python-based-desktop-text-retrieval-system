   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : OME FACE PAPER_CHASE GETTING QUAKE CHECKS ; INSURANCE : HOMEOWNERS MAY FIND THAT THEIR CHECKS FOR REPAIRS ARE ALSO MADE OUT TO THEIR MORTGAGE LENDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of local homeowners are starting to receive eagerly awaited checks from their insurance_companies for repair and reconstruction of properties damaged in the Northridge earthquake . Many of you may be surprised , however , to find that these checks are made_out to you and your mortgage lender . Without consent of such a mortgage holder , the checks can ' t be cashed and the money can ' t be spent on repairs . Lenders and other lien holders are named on insurance_company checks for two reasons . While residential lenders don ' t generally require borrowers to get earthquake insurance , earthquake coverage is usually just a rider or endorsement to general casualty policies in which lenders demand that they be named as payees . Also , insurance_companies want to avoid lawsuits by lenders that might claim an insurer ignored the lender ' s interest in the property . Unfortunately , insurance_companies and lenders don ' t follow any across-the-board policy in handling earthquake checks , which only adds_to the paper_chase nightmare that many homeowners with quake damage are already going_through . Some insurance_companies include the policyholder and all lien holders on all their earthquake damage checks . Other companies include lien holders only if the check is for more_than a certain amount_of_money arbitrarily set by the insurance_company . Lenders have differing policies too . Depending_on the size of the check , a lender may simply endorse the check and hand it back to the borrower , or the lender may place the check proceeds into an escrow account and release the funds only after the borrower offers proof that quake repairs have been made . The lender , however , can ' t generally keep the money . &quot; Lenders are supposed to be named in all checks regardless of the amount , but this isn ' t done , &quot; said Marlyn Dinon of Western Insurance Information Service , a nonprofit trade group funded by insurance_companies in the 10 Western states . &quot; Where the damage is small , the lien holder is hardly ever named. &quot; 20th Century Insurance Co . in Woodland Hills , however , is naming all known lien holders on its earthquake checks , said Rick Dinon , vice_president at 20th Century and the husband of Marlyn Dinon . Lenders holding a second_mortgage on the property will not appear on the check if their mortgage contract didn ' t require that they be named as a loss payee , he said . Otherwise , &quot; a loss payee endorsement to the insurance_policy ensures that the lender will be_on the check. &quot; Cashing an earthquake insurance check may be further complicated for borrowers who have refinanced , or who have had their loan sold in the so-called secondary market , Dinon said . If the name of the old mortgage holder is_on the check , the policyholder has to send the check back to the insurer , along with information about the new mortgagee . Homeowners who haven ' t received a check_in the mail yet should call their insurer and find_out in_advance about any joint payees , Dinon said . Alas , there is a lot of confusion about earthquake damage checks . For instance , a friend of mine in Woodland Hills who has earthquake insurance with 20th Century was told that he would get a $ 1 # 000 check for his earthquake damage . A 20th Century claims employee also told him that because his check was for less than $ 1 # 500 , it would be made_out directly to him and would not include his mortgage company . The 20th Century person said the $ 1 # 500 cutoff was required by state law . In fact , there is no such law , according to the California Department of Insurance . And my friend did get his $ 1 # 000 check made_out directly to him . Safeco Corp. , an insurance_company based in Seattle , has a more lenient policy regarding insurance checks than 20th Century . Earthquake damage checks issued for less than $ 5 # 000 by Safeco will generally not include any mortgage companies , said Robie Baker , catastrophe manager for the insurer in Glendale . But putting lenders ' names on larger checks &quot; keeps people from walking away from their homes , &quot; he said . &quot; Most mortgagees will bend over backward to work with catastrophe victims , &quot; Baker said . &quot; But we can ' t force them to hold by any standard. &quot; Unfortunately , he said , some mortgage companies &quot; will sometimes put our policyholders in a Catch-22 because they won ' t release insurance proceeds to a homeowner until the work is done . I try to referee these situations and get the parties to work the situation out. &quot; At California Federal Bank , any earthquake checks from insurance_companies for less than $ 10 # 000 can be endorsed over to the homeowner on the spot by a branch manager , said Donald L . Black , senior_vice_president , while checks of more_than $ 10 # 000 are &quot; handled on a case-by-case basis. &quot; * In deciding whether to endorse a larger check or place the funds in escrow , Black said , the savings and loan looks_at the borrower ' s past relationship with the institution , the value of the property and the size of the loan . Cal Fed won ' t use its power to withhold funds as a way to force certain troubled borrowers to pay_up on their loans . &quot; We would not require that a borrower bring the loan payments current before endorsing a check , &quot; Black said . &quot; We ' ve chosen not to do that. &quot; At Lomas Mortgage USA in Dallas , most insurance_company earthquake checks for $ 10 # 000 or less are being endorsed and sent_back to borrowers to spend at their discretion . But checks of more_than $ 10 # 000 , or checks being forwarded to Lomas by a borrower who is behind in payments , will be placed into a separate interest-bearing account , with the money released in stages , said Kelly Eckels , a Lomas assistant vice_president . Some real_estate loan documents state that the lender can demand that any insurance proceeds be used to reduce a borrower ' s debt , rather than repair the property . Despite what the documents say , courts generally won ' t allow such a provision to be enforced , said John H . Kuhl , partner in_charge of the real_estate finance practice at the Century City law_firm Cox , Castle &amp; Nicholson . According to the 1978 California appellate_court case of Schoolcraft vs . Ross , a borrower is entitled to use insurance proceeds to rebuild premises that have been damaged . A lender has to show that its security is being &quot; impaired &quot; before insurance proceeds can be used to reduce the debt . A lender may be able to argue that its security is being impaired , however , if the property cannot be restored to its condition and value just prior to the casualty , Kuhl said . &quot; Only an extremely aggressive lender would try to deny a borrower the money to rebuild , &quot; he added . &quot; And a court would most probably decide in favor of the homeowner. &quot; The net effect of Schoolcraft and provisions in California ' s Civil Code is that mortgage lenders may have the right to receive and control earthquake damage proceeds . But lenders are still required to make those proceeds available to pay the cost of repairing the damage that caused the money be available , Kuhl said . &quot; Surprisingly , we are not hearing about too many disputes between borrowers and lenders . It seems that most borrowers and lenders are able to agree without resorting_to the lawyers. &quot;</TEXT>
