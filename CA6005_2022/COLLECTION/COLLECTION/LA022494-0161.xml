   <HEADLINE> SIMI SEX EDUCATION CLASSES TO INCLUDE LESSONS ON BIRTH_CONTROL ; SCHOOLS : SOME PARENTS FEAR STUDENTS WILL GET MIXED MESSAGES . BUT THE BOARD SAYS THE PLAN BOLSTERS INSTRUCTION ON ABSTINENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the objections of some parents , the Simi Valley school_board Wednesday unanimously adopted a plan to add birth_control information to sex education classes in the seventh and 10th grades . Although some parents worried that discussing birth_control would send students a mixed message , the board agreed in a 5-0 vote that the plan adequately beefs_up lessons about sexual abstinence . Board_members Judy Barry and Doug Crosse at earlier meetings expressed opposition to the plan . The two decided to go_along because of a_few wording changes that they said made abstinence the most important lesson students will learn . &quot; This is the first time in a long_time the board has really come_together in making a tough decision , and it took a little bit of giving on everyone ' s part , &quot; Barry said after the meeting . &quot; Everyone came_out a winner. &quot; The remaining three board_members agreed to the changes , which they said simply clarified the intent of the plan developed by a 25-member committee of teachers , parents , administrators and nurses . &quot; We want the same things , &quot; board_member Diane Collins said . &quot; This meets the mom test. &quot; Board_member Debbie Sandland , who initiated the debate last spring when she proposed adding birth_control information to the curriculum , said she could live with the modifications . &quot; I think the only difference between myself and the people that want abstinence only is the only word , &quot; Sandland said . Some people on both sides of the issue said they were satisfied with the board ' s compromise , although parents who have argued against the plan for months said the issue wasn ' t totally put to rest . &quot; Our group ' s concern is that the abstinence message is in outline form only , so the content still needs to be worked_out , &quot; said Ginny Murray , one of the leaders of a parents group that has fought the plan . &quot; We ' re just going_to monitor it very closely. &quot; Some who support giving students birth_control information said the board did not go_far enough , because teachers will not be allowed to talk_about how various birth_control_devices work . &quot; They ' re going to have students do role-playing so they can learn to just say no , &quot; said Paige Moser , a coordinator of the Simi Valley chapter of the National Organization for Women . &quot; But what happens if they say yes ? &quot; During board discussion late Tuesday , board_members added three words to a committee ' s recommendations saying abstinence will be stressed &quot; as a standard. &quot; Another language change said students would be taught the consequences of their actions . Board_member Crosse said the benefit of all_the debate about sex education is that it has set a clear standard for teachers to follow . In the past , teachers have made their own decisions about what to teach , including about birth_control , Crosse said . But Crosse said he feared that formally placing birth_control information in the curriculum is just the start of a trend toward more permissive sex education . &quot; I have a major concern , personally , about the foot-in-the-door aspect of introducing this , &quot; Crosse said . When the board voted , President Carla Kurachi heard five &quot; aye &quot; votes_in favor , and no one opposed . She jokingly said , &quot; Wait a minute . Are there any abstentions ? &quot; Opponent Gary Morrison said he was pleasantly surprised by the unanimous vote , because Crosse and Barry won changes in the proposal for their votes . &quot; There was enough power with the three ( board_members ) that wanted it , they could have passed the program in its unmodified state , &quot; Morrison said . &quot; We would have had to live with that. &quot; The next step will be for a committee of teachers and nurses to take the board ' s direction to develop the specific program that teachers will use . Any materials chosen will be available for parents to review late this summer , said Leslie Crunelle , the district ' s director of secondary_education . Any parent will have the option of removing a child from the class , Crunelle said . The birth_control debate began last April , after a routine board review of the sex education curriculum . First-term board_member Sandland called the lack of birth_control information a major gap in students ' learning . To determine when and what students should learn about birth_control , the board formed a committee , which began meeting in September . The committee ' s recommendations were issued in December . The panel said students should learn basic information in a one-hour lesson about birth_control in the seventh grade , while a wider discussion of about two lessons would be reserved for high_school sophomores . The committee also recommended strengthening the teaching of abstinence by giving students skills to refuse an aggressive partner , resist peer pressure and build their self-esteem .</TEXT>
