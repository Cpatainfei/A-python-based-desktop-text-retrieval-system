   <HEADLINE> A MATTER OF ( ACADEMIC ) LIFE AND LIMB ; HEALTH : CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAS TAKEN GIANT STEPS IN THE FIELD . ITS BACHELOR ' S DEGREE_PROGRAM IN PROSTHETICS IS UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF ONLY THREE IN THE NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For four hours a day , five days a week , Ken Smith toils at a workbench in a dusty basement , applying physics , handcrafts and a touch of psychology to the project at_hand -- making legs . Smith fashions artificial limbs out of plastic , metal and rubber as part of his program in orthotics and prosthetics at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson . It ' s the only undergraduate degree_program of its kind in California and one of only three bachelor ' s level prosthetics programs in the nation . Previously , Smith ran a construction business . &quot; It ' s easier to use your mind than your brawn , &quot; Smith said as he fidgeted with the adjustments on a leg . Smith needs both the dexterity to build the legs and the clinical expertise to make_sure they fit , as well as the empathy to work well with patients . &quot; There are people out there that have the hand skills but don ' t have the people skills , &quot; Smith said . Prosthetists fill a doctor ' s prescription the same way a pharmacist fills a drug order , but doctors expect prosthetists to make suggestions about which artificial knee , limb or foot would work best for each patient . Smith is one of several students who designed prosthetic legs for Matt Baughman , 21 , who acts_as a patient . Baughman and several others are paid to come_to class three times a semester to be measured and fitted for limbs , giving the students a chance to practice their craft . When the class is over , the legs are generally disassembled and the parts reused . Last week , the professional patients made their final visit to Dominguez Hills , modeling the new legs while students discussed techniques for fabricating the pieces and answered questions from instructors . Some students , such_as Smith , whizzed through the process and presented a functioning artificial limb . Others haven ' t yet finished their limbs . Some students take_advantage of carbon graphite supports and high-tech metals that flex and add spring to a patient ' s step . Another new design uses a suction seal to hold the prosthetic_device on the patient , providing more stability and keeping water out . Fitted with the newest technology , people with artificial limbs run marathons , swim and play football , basketball and other sports . Prosthetists take the patient ' s activity level into consideration when they choose from the 125 prosthetic knees and dozens of feet available in the marketplace . * The first_step in making an artificial leg is to create a plaster_cast of the patient ' s residual limb . From that , a &quot; check socket &quot; is made of clear plastic . When the patient tries_on the check socket , the prosthetist can see against the transparent surface those points were the skin is pinched by excessive pressure . After assembly of the final socket , knee_joint , foot and ankle , the prosthetist adjusts the leg again . Often it ' s covered with foam that is colored and shaped to match the patient ' s other limb . Last week , the emphasis was_on the function of the students ' projects . As the patients walked back and forth , instructors observed the motion and gait of each leg . It takes practitioners about three weeks to make a below-the-knee prosthesis , which costs $ 2 # 500 to $ 6 # 000 , and about six weeks to make an above-the-knee model , which costs $ 4 # 000 to $ 12 # 000 . On average , patients replace their prosthetic_devices every three to five years , often using the same prosthetist . &quot; This is a lifetime relationship , &quot; said Scott Hornbeak , the director of the program at Dominguez Hills . Each of the 12 students will complete five semesters in the classroom and then spend 3 # 800 hours in a formal internship -- half in prosthetics , or the replacement of body_parts , and half in orthotics , which is the bracing of body_parts . To get certification , students must pass exams that test general_knowledge , technical expertise and patient management . About 3 # 000 are currently certified by the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics , based in Alexandria , Va . But even before becoming accredited , the students ' work is in_demand . &quot; There ' s no such thing as an out-of-work ( prosthetist ) , &quot; said Ed Ayyappa , a Dominguez Hills instructor . Fresh out of school and uncertified , practitioners earn $ 28 # 000 to $ 40 # 000 , Ayyappa said . Joining a relatively unknown profession does come_with a disadvantage , though . &quot; The word prosthetist will get you some raised eyebrows , &quot; said Dana Glidden , who added that she follows it with a quick explanation : &quot; I ' m in school to make artificial limbs and braces. &quot;</TEXT>
