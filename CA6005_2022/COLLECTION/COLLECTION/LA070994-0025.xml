   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE SOARS ALOFT WITH AQUATIC ANIMALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Columbia roared through clouds into orbit Friday , beginning a scheduled two-week mission to study the development of aquatic animals and cells . NASA officials fretted throughout the morning that storms might interfere with liftoff.But the weather cooperated and the shuttle blasted_off at 9:43 a.m. PDT . It was the first shuttle launch since April and the fourth this year . A puff of some material briefly appeared near the right solid-rocket booster about a minute into the flight as Columbia streaked over the Atlantic_Ocean . Shuttle manager Loren Shriver said it probably was condensation created by shock_waves , but he asked flight controllers to check their data as a precaution . Flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston also had to cope_with a computer problem in the final minutes of the countdown . Some of their monitors were off by nearly a second , but they worked around the problem . Once settled in a 184-mile-high orbit , the seven astronauts began powering up the bus-sized laboratory in the shuttle cargo bay . The crew includes Dr. Chiaki Mukai , the first Japanese woman in space . Columbia is carrying a variety of Japanese fish , newts and sea_urchins as well as toad eggs . There also are flies , slime_mold , mouse bones , roots , cress and lentil seedlings , day_lily cells , yeast cells , and human and mouse white_blood_cells . More_than 80 experiments are planned , with more_than 200 scientists from around the world participating . Shriver called the mission &quot; a stepping stone into the space_station program. &quot; Columbia is scheduled to return to the space center_on July 22 .</TEXT>
