   <TEXT> MAKING MUSIC Although the Palisades boys ' basketball_team was competing in the Beverly Hills tournament last week , 6-foot-5 starting center Greg Thomas missed a game . Thomas , a drummer for the group Oedipus , skipped a game to do a sound check at a West Hollywood nightclub . Sarah Schroeder , a Palisades volleyball_player , is the group ' s lead vocalist . Thomas ' decision struck a bad note with Palisades Coach James Paleno . He lost his starting job . Thomas earned his starting job back last week in an 84-73 win_over Jefferson in the final of the Eagle Rock tournament . Thomas had 16 rebounds Thursday as the Dolphins became the first_team in 19 years to win consecutive Eagle Rock tournament titles . HAWAIIAN DUTY Pacific Hills finished third last week in the Roosevelt Tournament in Honolulu . Bryan Sterling , who recovered from the chicken pox to make the trip , had career highs of 34 points and 14 rebounds as the Bruins beat host Honolulu Roosevelt , 70-52 . Sterling made all 16 of his free-throw attempts . &quot; It was beautiful , &quot; Pacific Hills Coach John Bobich said . &quot; We wore shorts the whole time . I think the low ( temperature ) was 70 degrees . We went_to the beach , did some snorkeling . We went_on all_the tours . I hated to come back. &quot; Pacific Hills ( 10-3 ) has had a successful holiday season . The Bruins also won the El Segundo tournament and finished fifth in the Charter Oak tournament . &quot; When we ' re healthy , we ' re good and we can play with anybody . If we don ' t come ready to play , we ' ve proved to be a less than average team. &quot; LOSING PAINS St . Monica ( 2-10 ) , off to its worst start in 10 years , may have lost 5-11 guard Gabe Pagtama for the season . Pagtama , who is averaging 15.4 points a game , suffered a hairline fracture of his right ankle and will be out a minimum of three weeks . Pagtama first felt a pain in the ankle on Thursday during the Mariners ' 74-72 loss to Granada Hills in the fifth-place game of the Chaminade tournament . Despite the loss of Pagtama , Coach Leo Klemm remains optimistic about the season . His son , 6-6 center Adrian Klemm , has recovered from a broken left ankle he suffered during football_season . Kenny Jackson , a 6-4 forward , has returned to practice after missing last week because of a shoulder injury . &quot; I still think were going_to be a good team when league starts , &quot; Klemm said . &quot; we ' ll find some good in all_of this. &quot; KANGAROO FEVER Venice High got a bittersweet taste of basketball ' s international flavor on Monday when it played host to the boys ' and girls ' teams from Condell Park High in Bankstown , Australia . The visitors were_on a three-week tour of four cities . In the San Diego Slam ' N Surf tournament , the Condell Park boys won the championship and the girls finished fourth in their division . Trailing by 11 points at halftime , the Gondolier boys outscored Condell Park , 23-8 , in the fourth quarter , to win , 64-55 . &quot; We finally took a game from someone at the end and this was against a very good team , &quot; Venice Coach Thermon Moore said . &quot; Intensity on defense is what we needed . And we showed we ' re making efforts in the right direction. &quot; Venice ( 8-6 ) was led by junior forward Quintin McCowen , who had 20 points . Moore hopes the Gondoliers get_off to a quicker start when they open Coastal Conference play_at Manual Arts Friday . &quot; We didn ' t get_down on ourselves . . . for what looked_like the eight count , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to carry it into league. &quot; In Moore ' s three previous seasons , Venice has yet to defeat Coastal Conference powers Manual Arts , Fairfax or Westchester and has beaten Palisades only once in three games . &quot; We definitely have equal talent , but we have to practice harder and play with intensity for an entire game , &quot; Moore said . &quot; If we don ' t , we ' ll just be a another good team that can ' t win. &quot; The Venice girls missed 16 free_throws in 21 attempts and lost to Condell Park , 56-43 . Karen Haddad had 12 points to lead Condell Park . Senior Carly Furuno and junior Yuriko Jung led the Gondoliers with 12 and 10 points . Venice will play host to Los Angeles at 4 p.m. Friday to open Coastal Conference play .

Campbell , who joined the Vikings ( 3-8 ) as a sophomore , is the team ' s leading scorer ( 13 ) and rebounder ( nine ) in his second season of organized basketball . &quot; So far he ' s doing a good job scoring and playing defense , &quot; Sprague said . &quot; He ' s got good three-point range with a nice high release , a lot of quickness and good ball-handling. &quot; Sprague believes Campbell has a particularly bright future because of his size and athleticism . &quot; He has all_the guard skills , and what impresses me most is that he is 6-foot-6 and still growing , &quot; he said . &quot; I fully expect him to be one of the best players in the Southern Section next year . I definitely believe he ' ll be good_enough to play Division I. &quot; BALANCED ATTACK Injuries and illness reduced the Culver City roster to seven players last week during the quarterfinals of the 22nd Hart Holiday Classic .
