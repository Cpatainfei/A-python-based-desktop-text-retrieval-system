   <HEADLINE> RAINFALL IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AS HEAVY AS PREDICTED ; WEATHER : STORM WILL BRING SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE COUNTY BUT THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE LIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The brunt of a Pacific storm will pass Ventura County by this weekend , leaving overcast skies and some scattered showers but not the heavy rainfall originally predicted , meteorologists said Friday . The rain could begin by this evening and continue into Sunday , with accumulations of up_to a quarter of an inch along the coast and half an inch in the inland areas , forecasters said . &quot; The heavy precipitation doesn ' t look_like it ' s coming &quot; to the county , said Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist with WeatherData , Inc. , which forecasts for The Times . Instead , the storm system will be concentrated in Northern and Central California , forecasters said . Although the amount of rain expected is less than originally predicted by some forecasters , it is still unusual for this late in the season . The record rainfall for April 24 -- the date when this weekend ' s rainfall is predicted -- is only one-tenth of an inch , recorded in 1983 . Thoren said if the storm does bring half an inch of rain to parts of the county , &quot; that would be an unusually wet system for this late in the season. &quot; The weather should be unseasonably cool as well as damp , Thoren said . Cold air from the Gulf of Alaska , where the storm system started , should bring a chill to the air , dropping temperatures into the 40s by Sunday evening . Brad Fujii , a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Oxnard , said average temperatures for the county this time_of_year are normally in the 60s or low 70s , with nighttime lows around 55 degrees . Snow levels in the Northern Sierra could drop as low as 3 # 000 feet , Fujii said . The Santa Barbara Mountains might see a slight dusting on Sunday , he said , if snow levels dip to 5 # 000 feet . Organizers for Ventura ' s California Beach Party , which starts today and continues through Sunday , said rumors about the predicted storm had been flying through the office all day Friday . But the party will go_on , rain or shine , according to event coordinator Faye Campbell . &quot; The weather report keeps changing , &quot; Campbell said . &quot; We expect to get either two half-good days or one good_day . If anybody stays home they ' re going to miss a good time. &quot; Campbell said it has never rained on the beach party in its eight-year history . Thoren said skies should be sunny this morning and during the early afternoon , with clouds rolling in during the late afternoon . High_temperatures should be in the 60s . Sunday is likely to be overcast , he said , with chances for sporadic showers throughout the day . Temperatures should be in the upper 50s to mid-60s during the day , dipping_into the 40s in the evening .</TEXT>
