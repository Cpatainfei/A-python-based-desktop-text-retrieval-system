   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MILOSEVIC SIGNATURE SEEN IN SERBS ' GAINS ; BALKANS : BELGRADE MASTERMIND ' RECONCILES ' WITH REBELS AS DREAM OF GREATER SERBIA IS_ON THE VERGE OF COMING TRUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First there was the appearance throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina of antiaircraft missile batteries that Western military sources said had come from Yugoslavia . Then there was U.N. confirmation of Yugoslav aid to Croatian Serb rebels , who in turn were openly collaborating with Bosnian Serbs in the month-old assault on Muslims in Bihac , the besieged enclave in the northwestern corner of Bosnia . Now Bosnian Serb politicians whose spurning of an international peace plan caused a highly publicized rift with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic earlier this year are suddenly heeding his advice that the proposal provides a &quot; good basis for negotiation. &quot; After months of diplomatic bickering that has masked military collaboration on the ground , Serbs throughout the Balkans have conveniently mended fences to take_advantage of the international community ' s indecisiveness over Bosnia , sensing that their dream of a Greater Serbia is_on the verge of coming true . U.N. officials , NATO sources and Western diplomats say the fine hand of Belgrade -- the capital of the new Yugoslavia , which consists_of Serbia and Montenegro -- is increasingly visible in the latest Balkan violence . They say they fear that Milosevic has been maneuvering his Bosnian and Croatian Serb pawns in a clever end game . &quot; There ' s a good chance he ' s been double-dealing and is involved in the Bihac stuff , &quot; one senior diplomat said , observing that while the evidence is not conclusive , &quot; I ' m suspicious as hell. &quot; The U.N. special envoy for the Balkans , Yasushi Akashi , said he is not as convinced as others of a grand conspiracy among the Serbs to expand their state against the will of the world . But asked if Milosevic is playing peacemaker as a smoke_screen to cover his followers ' determined land-grabbing , Akashi conceded , &quot; He may be. &quot; Consider the following incidents that indicate Yugoslav Serb involvement or orchestration of the latest violence racking the region : * When a Croatian Serb helicopter crashed during a bombing_run over Bihac in late November , the dead pilot was identified as a native and resident of Serbia . * Paramilitary thugs who detained and beat two Western photographers over the last week , American Ron Jacques and Frenchman Luc Delahaye , identified themselves as Serbs from Belgrade and wore the insignia of an elite commando squad loyal to Milosevic . * When Milosevic had the chance last month to have all U.N. sanctions lifted from his country by simply recognizing the prewar borders of Bosnia and Croatia , he refused . * Despite Belgrade ' s claims to have imposed a blockade against Bosnian Serbs for their refusal to endorse the international peace plan , SA-2 , SA-3 and SA-6 surface-to-air_missile batteries have made their way from Yugoslav army stocks across the allegedly sealed Bosnian border and are now capable of shooting_down aircraft from the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization over at least 40 % of Bosnian terrain . * Belgrade claims to have cut the fuel_line to the Bosnian Serbs , whose tanks were said to have ground to a halt last month . Yet convoys of fuel tankers listed as &quot; transit &quot; deliveries for Croatian Serbs are allowed through Serbian-occupied Bosnia by U.N. sanctions monitors , even though the two Serbian rebel factions are known to be collaborating in the assault on Bihac . * U.N. officials confirm that when Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev visited Belgrade last month he met not only Milosevic but also Bosnian Serb army chieftain Gen . Ratko Mladic , suggesting that the Serbian president ' s alleged break_with Bosnian Serbs has been a ruse . * A delegation from the intransigent Bosnian Serb parliament visited Belgrade a_few days ago to meet with Milosevic and express interest in resuming peace talks with the five-nation Contact Group -- the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . * Diplomatic sources say they have intelligence to suggest that Croatian Serb troops have moved through Yugoslav territory to deploy in Bosnia to help with the assault on Bihac . Yugoslav army helicopters also have been spotted ferrying supplies to Bosnian Serb troops in the east of the republic . The reconciliation of Milosevic with his Bosnian Serb proxies , if they were ever truly estranged , comes as foreign mediators seem most desperate to stifle the Balkan crisis with a paper settlement and when all_the Serbs have in_view are carrots , not sticks . Russia has demanded that the U.N. Security_Council lift all punitive sanctions levied against Yugoslavia for fomenting the Bosnian crisis , arguing that Milosevic is doing everything he can to bring_about peace . France and Britain , fearful for their thousands of soldiers serving as U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia , have tried to entice Bosnian Serbs back to negotiations by hinting that the rebels could annex their conquered territory to Yugoslavia in a Serbian confederation . The United States had previously rejected any premature rewarding of Serbia for no longer blatantly inciting Bosnian violence , insisting that sanctions should be eased only after the Bosnian Serbs agree to a negotiated peace . But senior U.S. officials have lately been proclaiming that unity within the NATO alliance and good relations with Russia are more important than a just Bosnian peace deal , signaling that Washington may bow to European pressures to craft a settlement acceptable to the Serbs . But in an example of appeasement creating appetites rather than sating them , Bosnian Serbs have recently upped the ante for compliance , demanding that NATO abandon protective air patrols over Bosnian skies . The U.S. ambassador to Croatia , Peter Galbraith , deemed the evidence of pan-Serbian collaboration &quot; very serious &quot; after hearing the brutal details of the torture of the two photographers , who were beaten , subjected_to a mock execution and doused with water and left in the cold . * Other Western diplomats have expressed fear that Milosevic has again duped foreign mediators into offering further concessions for the Serbs at the expense of Bosnian Muslims . &quot; I ' ve never been comfortable with the Contact Group ' s approach of dealing with Milosevic as a man of peace , &quot; one envoy said . &quot; Some people are too quick to forget how this whole_thing got started. &quot; Milosevic rose_to_power as head of the Serbian Communist_Party by whipping_up nationalist passions over the predominantly Albanian province of Kosovo and arming Croatian and Bosnian Serbs prior to their land grabs . If the assault on Bihac eventually succeeds and the last government-held pocket of northwestern Bosnia falls , Bosnian Serbs will hold more_than 80 % of the republic and will provide a supportive bulwark along the length of the Serbian-occupied territory in Croatia , making_it difficult , if not impossible , for Zagreb ever to reassert its authority over its lost land . And with the international community ' s current offer of &quot; confederal rights &quot; for the Bosnian Serb holdouts and the unbreakable grip that they would have_on occupied Croatian territory as a result , a Greater Serbia would be virtually achieved .</TEXT>
