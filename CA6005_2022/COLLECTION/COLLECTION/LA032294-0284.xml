   <HEADLINE> DOCUMENTARY ; NO WINDOWS , NO HEAT , NO HOT WATER -- AND NO VACANCIES AT SARAJEVO HOTEL ; JOURNALISTS FLOCK TO THE CITY ' S ONLY OPERATING INN , BARTERING LIQUOR , EGGS AND BATTERIES FOR THE MISSING AMENITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About halfway up the 11 flights to my room in the ozone_layer of the Holiday Inn , I ran_into my friend Jamie Graff from Time magazine , bounding down the glass-strewn stairwell in the opposite direction . &quot; I ' m getting an omelet in exchange for a bath , &quot; he declared gleefully , brandishing the immersion water_heater that would be his part of the deal . The uninitiated might assume the coiled metal rods Graff was carrying had something to do with the omelet , as the device looks_like an oversized egg beater . But any journalist who has holed_up at Sarajevo ' s Holiday Inn to cover the war in Bosnia instantly recognizes it as a means for heating water and knows its incalculable value . At the tail_end of a brutal winter in a hotel that has no running water , heat or intact windows , anything that can help you get warm or clean is a desirable barter good in the media ' s daily flea_market of favors , talents and information . The immersion water_heaters , which take about two hours to warm a full tub , can be seen changing hands in the hallways at all hours of the day and night , in trade for everything from granola_bars to cough medicine . As the only working hotel in this battered Bosnian capital and the sole place where journalists can get access to a satellite telephone to file their stories , the Holiday Inn , despite its dearth of amenities , has been the refuge of the foreign press corps since the Serbian siege of Sarajevo began two years ago . The hotel itself , which is no longer affiliated with the international chain , has been at the center of the conflict . It stands only a_few hundred yards from the front_line cutting_through this ruined city . Dozens of rooms on the south_side , facing the Serb-held neighborhood of Grbavica , have no windows , indeed no exterior walls . While its charms are lost on all but those desperately seeking a &quot; sat &quot; phone and access to the outside world , the Holiday Inn has become a strangely comforting -- almost familial -- retreat for the journalists who are compelled to live and work there . Confronted with physical hardships and the hazards of sniper fire and shelling , the press corps engages in a rare symbiosis , swapping creature comforts and generally ensuring that everyone gets_by . I earned the use of a coveted space_heater from the Philadelphia Inquirer correspondent for bringing in a supply of contact_lens solution . The Washington Post correspondent got Russian translation in exchange for driving me across the siege lines to Serb-held Lukavica in his armored car so that we could both talk to the Russian troops about their role here . In return for use of his water_heater , Graff exacted two eggs from the crate that a Time colleague had purchased in the rebel Serb stronghold of Pale and smuggled in his armored car into the hungry government-held part of the city . Fresh food is almost nonexistent in Sarajevo , which has been cut_off from trade and commerce by a Serbian blockade for two years . Some goods are swapped across the trenches by daring black-market dealers on both sides , making onions , potatoes and cabbages available at war-economy prices , but seldom is something so fragile as an egg to be bought for any amount_of_money . When journalists with armored cars and the necessary sheaf of credentials from all warring factions brave a crossing of the dangerous no-man ' s-land between the inner_circle of Bosnian government defense troops and the outer ring of Serb nationalist rebels , they stow caches of oranges , cheese , eggs and other goodies out_of_sight in their trunks or truck_beds to keep them from being pilfered by gunmen who paw through each vehicle crossing the gantlet of checkpoints . Even in Pale , the Serb staging ground 10 miles east of here where residents are safe from the shelling and able to continue with farming and some industry , many items are unavailable , like imported cigarettes , chocolate , batteries and liquor . After water boilers and space_heaters , these luxury items are most in_demand and have become the price of favors , like securing a room at the hotel when events overwhelm the staff ' s ability to provide even the shell of a room . When at least 400 foreign journalists thronged to Sarajevo ahead of the Feb . 21 threat of NATO air strikes , enterprising colleagues already ensconced at the hotel secured the last available rooms for their friends or held them in exchange for promises by latecomers that they would bring_in some scarce item as a payoff . Because each passenger allowed on relief flights operated by the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees is limited to 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) in luggage -- including laptop_computers , body_armor and emergency rations -- there is precious little allowance left for heavy breakables like bottles of booze . Nonetheless , to pry my humble cubicle from a Newsweek stringer , it cost two bottles -- one Scotch and one cognac -- plus four packs of AA batteries , in addition to the normal $ 90 per night for the heatless and waterless room in which even the interior walls are nicked with bullet_holes and shrapnel scars . Most days , staying_at the Holiday Inn differs little from camping . Plastic sheeting has replaced the glass long ago blasted out of the windows by artillery shells , making_it a challenge , even with a space_heater , to keep the inside temperature much higher than that outdoors . Electricity comes and goes , with an outage of several hours fairly common in early afternoon . But if the city supply is still pinched off by the surrounding rebels as European newspaper deadlines approach , the hotel turns_on its gas-powered generator , fed with U.N.-supplied fuel , to provide power to most rooms -- but just one outlet -- allowing journalists to plug_in their rechargeable laptops or portable satellite telex units . Water is even scarcer than power , which has taught the hotel regulars to immediately plug and fill their bathtubs when it ' s available so a sizable supply is_on hand to replenish the toilet tank when outages stretch to several days . The bathtub plug is missing from most rooms , however , so one has to be added_to a journalist ' s travel supplies . I forgot one on my last visit and had to pay_for the oversight by hauling gallons of water up 11 flights of stairs each day until I bribed a hotel maid to bring one from home_in exchange for two packs of cigarettes . Running water has become such a rare service these days that the Holiday Inn management has arranged for a water tanker to be parked outside so guests can fill and ferry containers to their rooms to have a survival ration to boil for drinking and washing . Those journalists who don ' t know to bring collapsible water bags have to fill empty wine_bottles from the restaurant to carry their supplies upstairs . Restaurant workers sometimes fill a_few dozen bottles after the communal dinner each night so those who didn ' t have time to fetch water before the 10 p.m. curfew have something to use overnight . It works this way : The waiters prune the tables of empty one-liter bottles that contained some of what seems an inexhaustible supply of cheap white_wine and fill them with water they say has been filtered . I usually grab a_couple_of these bottles anytime I make the long trek upstairs . That way I can keep a supply of six or eight liters on_hand for those times the power is_on and I can boil up enough hot water for a sponge_bath . One morning , as I heated_up successive cupfuls in my tiny electric kettle and dumped them into the bathroom sink , I detected a smell I couldn ' t quite identify , but I was suddenly overcome with images of apres-ski revelry and cozy fires . &quot; Hot spiced wine ! &quot; I eventually realized . &quot; Some people really know how to prepare . Here I can ' t even bathe properly and someone on this floor is having a party. &quot; It was only after dumping the newly boiled contents of my electric kettle into the sink that I realized the aromatic brew was of my own making . Apparently , a full bottle of wine had been accidentally placed among the bottles of filtered water . But having already soaped up and not wanting to bear the chill for as long as it would take_to boil a new sinkful , I rinsed in my warm cocktail and thought , &quot; Only in Sarajevo. &quot;</TEXT>
