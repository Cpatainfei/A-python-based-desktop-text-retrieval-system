   <TEXT> Grappling with serious structural damage and the onslaught of hundreds of injured people , many hospitals and clinics across Los Angeles continued Tuesday to buckle_under the strain of Monday ' s shattering earthquake . In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley , doctors turned a hospital parking_lot into an emergency_room , desperate kidney patients sought alternative care after five dialysis clinics closed , and quake victims waited in_line for hours for treatment of broken bones , mashed hands and cut heads and feet . Officials released details of several quake-related deaths at Los Angeles hospitals , including two babies born dead to quake-stressed mothers and a car crash victim who died when a power outage halted his ventilator . Psychiatrists told of traumatized quake victims , including one young_man who was trapped under rubble at a collapsed Northridge apartment complex and was forced to listen as three of his roommates died after being pinned in the wreckage . Hospital officials reported Tuesday that more_than 530 people were hurt badly enough to be admitted , while another 2 # 333 had been treated and released . The total casualties were almost 1 # 000 higher than the number of people injured during the 1992 riots , although more_than 50 people were killed in the riots . The earthquake has claimed at least 40 lives . More_than 700 patients -- many of them in intensive care -- were moved_out of quake-damaged facilities and transferred to other medical_centers . In the Valley , which bore the brunt of the temblor beneath Northridge , three hospitals -- the Veterans Administration facility in North Hills , Holy Cross Medical_Center in Mission Hills , and Olive View-UCLA Medical_Center in Sylmar -- were closed indefinitely because of structural damage and loss of water and power . Among the dozens of others that sustained enough damage to require them to move_out some of their patients were St . John ' s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica and the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Panorama City . Because of structural problems discovered late Monday , the county ' s psychiatric_hospital , part of the County-USC Medical_Center complex near Downtown , had to move_out its patients and also close doors to a large_number of outpatients . Childrens Hospital Los Angeles suffered some structural damage , and , like several hospitals in the area , canceled elective surgeries . At least eight earthquake victims were admitted to Childrens Hospital , including a 23-day-old infant with a broken leg . The baby ' s mother said it could have been caused when a clock fell on her while she was nursing the infant . At Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center , 25 patients had been admitted to the hospital for serious injuries by midday Monday , and at least 100 more were treated for lesser injuries and sent home . &quot; The emergency_room was jammed , &quot; said Ronald Wise , a spokesman for the hospital . He added that Cedars-Sinai is part of the countywide emergency response network , and its staff was_well prepared . &quot; We had 12 doctors and 15 nurses , plus technicians , and they immediately went_into the disaster-response mode . Everything worked very smoothly . We were able to take_on all comers , &quot; Wise said . Two of the busiest hospitals in the region Tuesday were Northridge Hospital Medical_Center , where doctors and nurses cared_for patients in a parking_lot , and Granada Hills Community Hospital , where there was no heat or water . At the Northridge facility , near the powerful earthquake ' s epicenter , more_than 300 people had been treated since the quake for broken bones , glass cuts , bad bruises and stress problems . Tired nurses and doctors set_up a makeshift emergency_room in a parking_lot where they evaluated patients under the hot sun , separating those who needed immediate care from those who could wait a while . A row of portable toilets stood nearby . &quot; Most everyone slept here last night , &quot; Dr. Paul Karis , chief of emergency medicine , said of the hospital staff . &quot; People haven ' t had a shower . There ' s no running water . The toilets are in the parking lot. &quot; Karis said the quake also knocked_out the hospital ' s CAT scan and magnetic imaging equipment , needed to diagnose head and spine injuries . &quot; We don ' t know when they ' re going to be back_up , &quot; he said . As regular staffers grew exhausted , more_than three dozen doctors , nurses and psychiatrists were brought into the hospital under a federal medical relief program . * One of them , Dr. Steve Salenger , chief_of_staff at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino , said he counseled anxious earthquake victims as well as exhausted doctors and nurses Tuesday . Salenger said one victim , a young Desert Storm veteran , was trapped for more_than three hours under the rubble of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex where 16 people died , including three of the man ' s roommates . &quot; He couldn ' t move , and he could hear one of his roommates slowly choking to death each time there was a slight settling of the rubble , &quot; Salenger said . &quot; Since coming here , he ' s been withdrawn . He ' s afraid to be alone . He ' s sleeping_in the hospital because he ' s afraid to go anywhere else. &quot; Karis said two babies were born dead at Northridge when their mothers went_into quake-induced labor . At Holy Cross , 20-year-old Lionel Ventura died when the earthquake knocked_out power to his ventilator , according to the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office . Coroner ' s investigators were told that Ventura had been at the hospital since December , when he was injured in a car crash . Elsewhere in the Valley , five kidney dialysis centers were put_out of operation by the earthquake , affecting an estimated 300 patients who need the blood cleansing treatments to stay alive , health officials said . &quot; It ' s just wild and woolly , &quot; said Linda Black , administrator of the St . Joseph Regional Dialysis Center in Burbank . &quot; Individual patients are wandering around . . . calling to find a place to get treatment . There are so many that just don ' t know what to do . I can ' t tell you how many people have called me , frantic. &quot; Several hospitals canceled routine appointments and elective surgeries to handle emergency patients .</TEXT>
