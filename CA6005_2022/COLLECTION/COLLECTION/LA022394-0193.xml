   <TEXT> The International Commission of Jurists said Tuesday that Mexican troops committed serious human_rights abuses in trying to put_down a peasant uprising in Chiapas last month . The accusation came_in a preliminary report by a mission of two Latin_American lawyers sent by the respected Geneva-based body earlier this month to investigate the situation in the southern state following the rebellion . &quot; Government troops were guilty of serious violations of human_rights , &quot; said a summary of the report issued by the commission , which has a membership of 45 lawyers around the world and aims to defend the rule_of_law . &quot; These violations included : summary executions of prisoners , some of whom had been wounded before their capture ; the arbitrary detention of perhaps more_than 200 civilians , torture and other forms of abuse , &quot; the commission said . The report was issued as peace talks were under way in the Chiapas capital of San Cristobal de las Casas between rebel leaders and Mexican government envoys . The two commission lawyers , Alejandro Artucio of Uruguay and Eduard Duhalde of Argentina , said in the report that they feared people may have been kidnaped by the armed forces . There were approximately 20 people whose whereabouts were unknown , they said . The report estimated that between 200 and 300 people died in the 10 days of fighting after the rebels seized several towns in the region Jan . 1 . The conflict was rooted in extreme poverty and discrimination against the indigenous population , it said . The two lawyers said that during 10 days in Chiapas and in Mexico_City from Feb . 1 through Feb . 10 , they received no complaints of abuses against civilians by the insurgents ' Zapatista National Liberation Army . But they also recorded that they received &quot; generous cooperation and support &quot; from the Mexican government and local authorities .</TEXT>
