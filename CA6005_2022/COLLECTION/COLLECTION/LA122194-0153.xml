   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; HEADING TO EL NORTE -- TO SHOP ; FROM THE BERNINI BOUTIQUE TO PRICE CLUB , MEXICAN VISITORS SPEND BILLIONS EACH YEAR IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA . THE SUPER-RICH SEEK SAFETY AND LUXURY . THE MIDDLE_CLASS JUST WANT TO FIND BARGAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the Paladion mall , a sleek downtown citadel patrolled by well-dressed guards with earphones , a customer from Mexico walks in and buys $ 60 # 000 worth of designer suits at the Bernini boutique . He pays_cash . At Price Club 10 miles to the south , a suburban bastion of U.S. consumer culture , the bustle of Spanish-speaking families and cars with yellow Baja California license_plates resembles a Mexican marketplace . About three-quarters of the customers drive_up from Tijuana , which has the largest middle_class among Mexican border cities . The two businesses have one thing in common : Their survival depends_on customers from Mexico . Particularly during the holidays , hundreds of thousands of legal Mexican border-crossers descend on San Diego and spend money . They contribute more_than $ 2.8 billion a year to the U.S. economy , mostly in the San Diego border region , according to a recent study . Tuesday ' s devaluation of the peso will reduce Mexican spending power , but it is not expected to seriously affect cross-border buying patterns , analysts say . In California , the vehement dispute over illegal immigration and Proposition 187 centers relentlessly on working-class immigrants , obscuring the beneficial influx of wealthy and middle-class Mexican visitors . But the political acrimony has not altered a fundamental border reality : This city has profound economic and cultural ties to Tijuana and the rest of Mexico . &quot; These people coming here to shop , to work , to go_to our movie_theaters , have legal_documents , &quot; said Millicent Cox , a researcher at UC San Diego who oversaw this year ' s border study . &quot; They aren ' t coming here to take_advantage of us . They are coming here because it is part of their community. &quot; San Diego holds a special allure for Mexicans from the interior as well , combining climate , a convenient location and a glamorous , resolutely American image . It is a de_rigueur stop in the orbit of the Mexican ruling_class , along with country homes outside Mexico_City , the beaches of Acapulco , and U.S. destinations including Houston , Miami and the ski slopes of Colorado . &quot; In the summer , I see more of my friends here than in Mexico_City , &quot; said former diplomat Marcela Merino , a human_rights researcher at a Tijuana think_tank , who lives_in La Jolla . Tycoons , former presidents and future cabinet_ministers own vacation_homes in La Jolla , Coronado and other outposts of a voraciously ostentatious lifestyle satirized by the foremost chronicler of the Mexican elite , Guadalupe Loaeza , in her 1992 book , &quot; I Shop , Therefore I Am. &quot; You hear patrician Mexico_City accents in yacht_clubs , exclusive restaurants and hip cafes . San Diego is both a playground and a refuge from Mexico ' s smog , crime and political violence . &quot; They feel safe here , &quot; said Shirley Muller , who owns a bilingual bookstore in Coronado where her fellow Mexico_City natives sip espresso and browse through newspapers and novels from home . &quot; Here they wear their jewels . You have the most beautiful boutiques in Mexico_City , you can find anything you want . But the attitude still is , ' Let ' s go_up to the States. ' There is still that thing that if it ' s made in the States , it has to be better. &quot; * Although not as flashy as the millionaires , Tijuana ' s expanding middle_class is central to San Diego ' s prosperity -- the mirror_image of the Southern Californians whose dollars drive Baja ' s tourism and service_industries . Tijuana government officials , factory managers , entrepreneurs and professionals flock north to the movies , the zoo , Sea World , supermarkets , outlet stores , swap meets and football and soccer games . Nonetheless , the benefits remain largely invisible to many residents of San Diego , whose views are often shaped by problems such_as illegal immigration and drug violence . &quot; The average San Diego resident has no conception of the economic benefits that Tijuana brings_to San Diego because they have an out-of-date view of Tijuana as an impoverished place , &quot; said Charles Nathanson , a UC San Diego border expert . A recent focus group led by Nathanson toured the Mexican city and was &quot; amazed that Tijuana had grown_into a thriving industrial and commercial center. &quot; The massive legal flow_from Tijuana includes about 40 # 000 workers who travel_to jobs in San Diego using &quot; commuter alien &quot; work_permits granted to applicants from the Mexican border region . An estimated 27 % of northbound crossings are by people who have green_cards granting permanent residence in the United States ; others are U.S. citizens by virtue of immigration history or birthplace . And tens of thousands obtain &quot; border-crossing cards &quot; that , based on proof of financial stability , allow stays of 72 hours within 25 miles of the international line . Travelers from the Mexican interior , meanwhile , tend to use tourist visas that permit repeat extended visits . The cross-border network of interdependence seems largely impervious to activists ' calls_for Mexicans to use economic power to punish California for perceived anti-immigrant politics . Several retaliatory boycotts of San Diego have drawn lukewarm support . &quot; For many people in Tijuana , a sustained boycott would create a real hardship , &quot; said Cox of UC San Diego . &quot; They might respect a one-day boycott . But would they realistically stop crossing ? I can ' t imagine someone who works here giving_up their job. &quot; Khaled Richani , manager of the Bernini and Versace boutiques at the Paladion mall , said Mexicans still account_for half of his sales . But Richani has noticed a decline since the bitter November election . &quot; Proposition 187 has affected Tijuana ( clients ) . I can feel it , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m worried that it might have a permanent impact . These people can shop anywhere they want. &quot; When the Paladion opened two years ago , the marble-and-glass atrium mall targeted the Mexican market with opulent stores , valet parking and a pianist performing beneath an art nouveau statue of a nymph . &quot; Everyone in San Diego recognizes that Mexicans are a vital aspect of our economy and they all have marketing programs for them , &quot; said Jonathan Bailey , the mall ' s marketing manager . &quot; The market continues to grow . They have been extremely helpful in keeping these businesses successful. &quot; Well-off Mexicans have gravitated to San Diego for years . After the traumatic devaluation of the peso in 1982 sent Mexican_capital fleeing abroad , an expatriate colony of sorts flourished in Coronado , a bay-side oasis of stately homes and serene streets . So many of the newcomers bought condominiums in the commanding Coronado Shores beachfront development that some mean-spirited neighbors dubbed it the &quot; Taco Towers. &quot; Today , the Mexican elite visit during the Easter and Christmas seasons , the summer , holidays and for weekend getaways . They go_to the doctor and elderly Mexicans spend months here for state-of-the-art medical_care . They buy products considered better or cheaper than those available in Mexico . They go_to the bank . They unwind . Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , a leftist opposition leader and two-time presidential candidate , has been seen relaxing in jeans in the tasteful lobby of the La Valencia Hotel overlooking the La Jolla cove . The wife of a fugitive Tijuana drug lord was spotted strolling through Nordstrom at the Fashion Valley mall last year , days after her husband ' s gunmen allegedly killed a Roman_Catholic cardinal in Guadalajara . Mexican television personality Nino Canun visited Tijuana to host a talk_show in which the guests lambasted alleged racism in the United States ; then he made a cross-border foray to a Chula Vista drugstore and bought a cartload of goods . &quot; You see someone in here today and tomorrow you see them on television , &quot; said saleswoman Beyka Salman of Cartier at the Paladion . Salman , a U.S.-educated Tijuana native , is one of many mall employees selected for their impeccable Spanish . Mexicans represent about 35 % of sales at Cartier , according to store manager Shohreh Parvin . Although the clients may speak the_English of the Ivy League , they like to do business in Spanish . They prefer large and glitzy items such_as a gold Panther watch that sells for $ 11 # 500 . &quot; They love to shop when they are away , &quot; Parvin said . &quot; They don ' t like to shop when they are in Mexico . There ' s a safety_factor . They don ' t want to be seen buying jewelry at home. &quot; Across the atrium at Tiffany , prominent Mexico_City families arrive with entourages of bodyguards and spend up_to &quot; six figures &quot; on crystal and china , employees said . The ironies have not been lost on Mexican literary observers ; for decades , this insular plutocracy has provided them with abundant material . In &quot; I Shop , Therefore I Am , &quot; Loaeza explores an era in which the rich got richer . As then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari oversaw a dramatic drive to open the economy and privatize state enterprises , the ranks of billionaires swelled from one in 1987 to at least 24 today . Following well-heeled women on jet-set shopping excursions , Loaeza ' s book skewers their ultra-mannered slang sprinkled with English , their obsessive appetite for designer labels . These excesses are a grim counterpoint to the poverty endured by an estimated 40 million Mexicans . Former diplomat Merino of La Jolla moves between both worlds , dedicating two days a week to social_work among the Mixtec Indians of Tijuana ' s shack town periphery . With mixed resignation and amusement , she said Loaeza paints a basically accurate picture . &quot; My friends can spend $ 5 # 000 in a day at Neiman Marcus , &quot; Merino said . &quot; They don ' t believe the poor exist . They think I invent them. &quot; Moral considerations aside , Mexican money represents a rare opportunity for growth on San Diego ' s barren economic landscape . Merchants work to keep cross-border shoppers happy and woo them from aggressive competitors such_as Houston and Dallas . Paladion management joined a city delegation on a recent promotional trip to Mexico_City and sponsors classical concerts at clients ' palatial homes . * Because of northern Mexico ' s modernizing , predominantly urban economy , Tijuana ' s income distribution resembles San Diego ' s to a surprising degree , according to sociologist Nathanson . &quot; As you map the census tracts of the two cities , there ' s an enormous similarity , &quot; he said . &quot; So there ' s increasingly an interdependence of equality. &quot; The study generated compelling numbers : There are 6 million northbound crossings from Tijuana to San Diego each month . Shopping is the primary purpose of about 1.6 million visits , primarily to Chula Vista , a border-area suburb , and the malls of southern and central San Diego . &quot; Some stores in San Diego have a greater variety of goods , &quot; the study said . &quot; Auto parts stores . . . benefit from customers who like to take_advantage of the quick distribution of parts from the main warehouse instead of waiting two weeks in Tijuana for a $ 20 item . Perceived quality is an important part of the purchase decision : High-quality meat , fresh produce without pesticides and good quality toilet_paper , for example , are more readily available in San Diego. &quot; The $ 2.8 billion spent yearly in the area by Mexicans generates $ 120 million in California sales tax , the study found . Those estimates are decidedly conservative , Cox said . Researchers did not cover air arrivals and they believe that some people understated spending because the official -- if intermittently enforced -- Mexican customs limit on duty-free goods is $ 50 per person . The top consumer destinations : Ralphs , Vons and Price Club , which has waged a membership campaign at Tijuana factories and professional_associations . In fact , PriceCostCo . opened its first Tijuana outlet -- the ninth in Mexico -- this month . But executives expect that the Chula Vista Price Club a_few miles north will not suffer . Shopping is an ingrained ritual based on more_than just acquisition or convenience . &quot; It ' s as much a day or weekend trip as it is a shopping trip , and Price Club is just one of the destinations , &quot; said Bob Hickok , a Price Club vice_president . &quot; It ' s part of the culture to come_to San Diego to visit family and friends. &quot; Hector Cordoba , a Price Club_member for seven years , personifies the emerging Tijuana middle_class . A dignified , down-to-earth businessman in a suede jacket , he recently emerged from the cavernous Chula Vista store burdened with provisions for holiday feasts . He runs a business that delivers potable water to Tijuana homes and lives in Playas de Tijuana , a pleasant coastal neighborhood . But he spends a lot of time and money in San Diego . &quot; It ' s cheaper and it has more to offer , &quot; Cordoba said . He does not take_issue with the California crackdown on illegal immigrants . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , it ' s all_right that they deny services if people were taking_advantage of them , &quot; Cordoba said . &quot; Everybody should work for a living. &quot; For all_the vocal Mexican criticism of U.S. immigration policies , Cordoba ' s attitude reflects the sentiments of other Tijuanenses who endure long waits at the freeway ports_of_entry . Although illegal immigration occurs on their doorstep , they do not feel that the issue affects them personally . And border-crossing is part of the fabric of their daily lives . &quot; I think this Price Club survives purely because of Mexican people , &quot; Cordoba said . &quot; I don ' t think people are going_to stop buying here. &quot;</TEXT>
