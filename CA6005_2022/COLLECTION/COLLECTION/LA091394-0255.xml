   <HEADLINE> 17 NATIONS PLEDGE TROOPS TO HAITI PEACEKEEPING FORCE ; CARIBBEAN : U.S. APPEALS GARNER 1 # 500 POLICE AND MILITARY_PERSONNEL . FRANCE AND CANADA DENY REQUEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , laying the groundwork for a yearlong multinational occupation of Haiti , announced Monday that a total of 17 other countries have agreed to send 1 # 500 police and military_personnel to the island nation -- as long as U.S. forces go ashore first . Officials said the new force commitments will save the United States from being stuck_with sole responsibility for the potentially dangerous mission of policing Haiti after an invasion . And that , they said , should help build public and congressional support for intervening . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher called a news_conference to trumpet the 17 enlistments , which came_after weeks of behind-the-scenes appeals_to foreign leaders from President Clinton and his aides . The countries that have offered to provide forces soon after U.S. forces enter Haiti include Britain , Israel , the_Netherlands , Belgium , Argentina , Panama , Bolivia , Bangladesh and nine former British colonies around the Caribbean , officials said . But at least six other countries , including longtime U.S. allies France and Canada , turned Clinton down , at least for now . Christopher aides drafted a list of 23 participating countries Monday morning , but they pared it back to 17 as it became clear that some commitments were not coming_through . Christopher said he expects more countries to sign_on in coming weeks , however . The newly committed foreign forces are a key part of the Administration ' s plan for the transfer of power in Haiti , which officials have been revising during recent weeks as a U.S. invasion began to appear inevitable . The plan now has three basic phases , officials said : Phase 1 is the landing of an all-U.S. force of 20 # 000 or more troops -- either an invasion to dislodge Haiti ' s military regime or a relatively peaceful operation if the regime gives_up power without a fight . The U.S. force will be responsible_for securing key installations and making_sure there is no armed resistance to the reinstallation of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Phase 2 , described by one senior official as &quot; pacification , &quot; could begin as soon as 48 hours after a peaceful landing . The U.S. invasion force would be drawn down rapidly to perhaps 4 # 000 . About 2 # 000 foreign troops -- including the 1 # 500 announced on Monday -- would arrive to keep order and begin building a new Haitian police_force . Phase 3 , peacekeeping , would begin as soon as the Administration can persuade the United Nations to take_over the job and turn the multinational intervention force into a U.N. peacekeeping force . Even then , the remaining force of about 6 # 000 troops would still include at least 2 # 000 Americans . Christopher has said that the entire peacekeeping operation should end in early 1996 -- after a little more_than a year . But other officials worry that this calendar is overly optimistic and predicted that U.S. troops will be needed in Haiti for at least two years after Aristide ' s government is restored . Administration officials acknowledged Monday that a protracted military operation like the one envisioned in Haiti will require a call-up of at least some military reservists , a politically sensitive step . Under the Pentagon ' s post-Vietnam doctrine , many of the units most suited to pacification work in Haiti , such_as companies trained to assist civil governments , have been largely transferred to the reserves . With the active force shrinking under pressure of budget_cuts , the Pentagon clearly will need reservists once the initial fighting ends . Nevertheless , the step is sure to be controversial because the activation of reserve units disrupts the lives of the individuals and affects their families and their communities . The Pentagon avoided reserve call-ups throughout the Vietnam_War , although the George_Bush Administration activated reservists for the war in the Persian_Gulf . In any case , officials said Monday ' s announcement marked a significant accomplishment for the Administration , eliminating fears that the United States might invade Haiti and then find that none of its major allies were willing to share the burden of pacifying the country . Most of the foreign contingents offered are small , and the United States has offered to pay_for transportation and other support costs for some countries , especially the small Caribbean_island countries , officials said . The Caribbean countries that have offered to participate are Antigua , Bahamas , Barbados , Belize , Dominica , Guyana , Jamaica , St . Vincent , and Trinidad_and_Tobago . France , which once ruled Haiti as a colonial power and has taken an active role in diplomacy on the issue , turned the President down flat , despite a personal_appeal from Clinton to French President Francois Mitterrand , diplomats said . Canada is still considering the issue , officials said , despite a last-minute telephone plea from Clinton to Prime_Minister Jean Chretien over the weekend . &quot; We said ' no , ' &quot; a Canadian official said , &quot; but it was a positive ' no. ' &quot; Canada has already promised to send several hundred French-speaking officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to Haiti to help train a new police_force , but at this point they will wait until a U.N. force is in place . At his news_conference at the State_Department , Christopher repeated the Administration ' s warnings that time is running_out for the Haitian junta and said the addition of the new forces would not delay U.S. military_action . Times staff writers Norman Kempster and Richard A . Serrano contributed to this report . * DEBATE DEMANDED : Republican congressional leaders seek vote on Haiti . A12</TEXT>
