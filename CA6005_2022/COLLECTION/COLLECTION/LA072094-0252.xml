   <HEADLINE> TACO BELL TO HIRE GUARDS AT OUTLETS STAYING OPEN LATE ; CRIME : THE ORANGE COUNTY-BASED CHAIN SAYS SECURITY COSTS WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL BUT ARE NONETHELESS NECESSARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In recognition that &quot; it ' s a nasty world out there , &quot; Taco Bell Corp . Chairman John Martin said Tuesday he has authorized the hiring of security_guards at company-owned stores that stay open late at night . The decision to bolster security was driven_in part by the January slaying of four employees at a Taco Bell restaurant in Clarksville , Tenn . Police reported that the restaurant ' s safe was open and cash_registers were empty . Taco Bell , which has 4 # 500 locations , will spend &quot; several million dollars per quarter &quot; to post off-duty police_officers and security_guards at an unspecified number of restaurants that keep late hours . &quot; It ' s a very substantial expense for us , &quot; Martin said . &quot; But we ' ve come_to the conclusion that it ' s a nasty world out there. &quot; Restaurant and retail industry observers applauded Taco Bell ' s decision to help safeguard employees and customers . &quot; All restaurants have to face security costs these days , &quot; said Michael Rhodes , president of Orange-based Frontier Restaurants and president of the Orange County chapter of the California Restaurant Assn . &quot; You run the risk of robbery and break-ins at closing time , &quot; Rhodes said . &quot; You don ' t even want employees leaving alone at night . You want them to leave in groups of two or three. &quot; Security_guards are less common at fast-food restaurants than at bars and grills , which typically stay open later . &quot; It can be a scary thing at late hours , &quot; Rhodes said . &quot; People have been out at parties or whatnot , they can be feeling boisterous , and tempers can flare . You don ' t want ( employees ) trying to restore law and order. &quot; Most consumers welcome the added sense of security , experts said . &quot; It translates as someone is looking_out for their safety after dark , &quot; said Anna Northcutt , a former FBI_agent who directs security at San Diego-based Hahn Co. ' s 45 shopping_malls . &quot; I know that when I pull into a fast-food place at 11 or 12 o ' clock at night , I feel more comfortable with an off-duty policeman standing there. &quot; Most fast-food restaurants close early , negating the need for -- and expense of -- late-night security . Operators who do remain open late at night say that the cost of hiring guards can be prohibitive . Most fast-food restaurants &quot; don ' t typically do that much business at night anyway , and now you have to cover the added cost of security , &quot; said one hamburger chain franchisee who asked not to be identified . &quot; The result is that many places that need security at night simply close earlier. &quot; Separately Tuesday , Taco Bell reported a 5 % decline in operating profit for its latest fiscal quarter , despite a 19 % increase in revenue . The Irvine-based fast-food company , a subsidiary of soft-drink giant Pepsico Inc. , said it earned $ 54.6 million for the quarter , down from a profit of $ 57.4 million for the same period a year earlier . Revenue for the company ' s second quarter , which ended June 11 , rose to $ 767.1 million from $ 643.1 million . Martin said the drop_in operating profit was driven by one-time expenses and that &quot; the business is still healthy. &quot; Same-store sales -- those at locations open for more_than a year -- were up 3 % , he said , &quot; which is still very dynamic. &quot; &quot; This was just one quarter where everything came_together on the cost side , &quot; Martin said . &quot; We ' re still within our plan. &quot;</TEXT>
