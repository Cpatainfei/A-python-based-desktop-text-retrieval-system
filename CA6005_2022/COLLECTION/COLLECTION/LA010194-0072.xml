   <HEADLINE> A TALE OF TWO SORRY TRUCES ; IRA VIOLENCE PALES NEXT TO THE AWFULNESS OF BOSNIA ' S FAILED CEASE-FIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 1993-94 holiday season is proving to be , among other things , a tale of two truces . Neither truce makes_for a happy tale , but the difference between them is instructive . The first truce is the Bosnian one that , running from Dec . 23 to Jan . 15 , was to include both the Croats ' Roman_Catholic and the Serbs ' Eastern Orthodox Christmas . What the interval has become , instead , is a ferocious push for territory in the last_days before a perhaps fateful round of negotiations begins . On Christmas_Day alone , the Serbs pumped 689 artillery shells into Sarajevo , including several that landed near Kosevo Hospital , according to monitors from the United Nations . The Sarajevo toll for the Dec . 23-26 period was 11 dead and 99 wounded . Another U.N. monitor reported 100 Croat shells fired into Muslim eastern Mostar on Christmas_Day . The religious element in this quasi-religious war has never shown an uglier face . The second truce was the traditional 72-hour Christmas truce of the_Irish Republican Army in Northern_Ireland . The IRA observed the truce but , 16 minutes after its expiration , fired a mortar shell at a police_station in a village west of Belfast . Further attacks then came_in quick succession , including Thursday ' s slaying of a British soldier , hit by a single sniper bullet as he patrolled . The recent Anglo-Irish Joint Declaration on Northern_Ireland had been fueled by a hope that the IRA , showing_the_way to the &quot; men of violence &quot; on the other side , might be ready to call a halt to arms . Those who from the start scoffed at this hope can only seem vindicated by these holiday season attacks . But the calculated mockery by the IRA means infinitely less than the superficially comparable actions in Bosnia , for the Anglo-Irish Joint Declaration represents a harmony among ancestral enemies in the_British Isles that has no counterpart in the Balkans . Northern_Ireland was once as Bosnia now is . Once , alleged outlaws actually did the bidding of legitimate governments . Now , the outlaws on either side are without official support and with a steadily shrinking base of unofficial support . In isolation and with their number declining , they can still kill , but they cannot win ; in time they will see this . The joint declaration rests_on a consensus that no sniper can bring_down . A comparable reconciliation in the Balkans is no doubt years or decades away , and yet let no one declare it impossible . The post-Cold War world may seem fissiparous and seething with new antipathies , but in a longer look_back , forgotten reconciliations return to memory . Reconciliation between the Castilians and the Catalans in Spain once seemed impossible , but despite as_many as a_million deaths it was achieved . Reconciliation will come_in Ireland too and someday -- however unimaginable this seems as 1994 opens -- even in South Slavia .</TEXT>
