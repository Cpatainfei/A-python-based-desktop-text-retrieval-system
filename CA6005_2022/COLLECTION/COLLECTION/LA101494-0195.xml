   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; REDSTONE SAYS VIACOM MAY GET INTO RECORD BIZ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The record business seems to be music to Sumner Redstone ' s ears . The Viacom Inc. chairman , speaking in France at the international television marketing conference , said the company is edging toward record distribution , prompted by recent efforts by major record labels to form a competitor to Viacom ' s MTV music channel . Redstone said Viacom previously thought it would not go_into the business . It released records from its &quot; MTV Unplugged ' series with major record labels , he noted , earning a royalty payment . But the company believed it should not compete with its suppliers , the record companies , he said . &quot; Now that the record companies are interested in competing with us , it is no longer a forbidden agenda , &quot; Redstone said . &quot; They have already taken a shot at us , and even though I doubt their channel would ever get past the Justice_Department , that is the way they have decided to do it. &quot; Bertelsmann Music Group , which owns the RCA and Arista labels , and cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. announced plans last year for a music video network but scrapped them in June . Warner Music , Sony , EMI and PolyGram , along with Ticketmaster , later announced similar plans . Redstone said any Viacom record company would probably involve a distribution joint_venture with another label . He also said a number of promotional opportunities involving Viacom assets exist , including its newly acquired Paramount Communications and Blockbuster Entertainment operations . Sources say one possibility is that Viacom will strike a deal with Walter R . Yetnikoff , the former CBS Records chief . Paramount , which for years was criticized for not acquiring a record company , came_close on several occasions , but talks always fell_through . Blockbuster has diversified from video rentals into music retailing and is now one of the nation ' s largest music store chains .</TEXT>
