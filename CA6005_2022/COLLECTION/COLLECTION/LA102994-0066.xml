   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE CLUB ANGRY OVER SEA_LION ' S DEATH ; COURT : AN EXPLOSIVE IN A FISH BLEW OFF THE ANIMAL ' S HEAD IN FRONT OF A PASSING GROUP OF SCHOOLCHILDREN . THE SUSPECT DENIES GUILT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Orange Coast College science club has started a letter-writing campaign to push for tough prosecution of a man accused of blowing_up a sea_lion by tossing it a dead fish with an explosive inside . The Marine Mammal Research Group , a club of 25 students interested in marine biology , wants students and other people interested in sea_lions to send letters to Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti and encourage his office to fully prosecute a man arrested on suspicion of killing the sea_lion nicknamed Oscar . Vincent Terzoli , a San Pedro fisherman , was charged in June with felony cruelty to animals in the April 8 incident near Berth 73 in Los Angeles Harbor . Police allege that Terzoli threw Oscar a &quot; seal bomb &quot; -- an explosive usually used to harmlessly scare_away sea_lions -- inside a fish carcass . The explosive blew the mammal ' s head_off , and the incident was witnessed by a boatload of passing schoolchildren on a harbor tour , police said . Oscar -- also known as Jelly by some old_salts and regulars in the harbor area -- was a frequent visitor to the San Pedro waterfront and often ate what visitors threw to him , Los Angeles Port Police Lt . Martin Renteria said . Renteria said concerned residents called the police after the incident . &quot; We had several complaints about how cruel it was to destroy an animal , &quot; he said . OCC marine biology professor Dennis Kelly , who advises the Marine Mammal Research Group , said students do not want charges against the fisherman to be reduced in any plea-bargaining arrangements . &quot; Students want to encourage the district_attorney to fully prosecute the gentleman who carried_out this deed , &quot; Kelly said . &quot; It was pretty awful. &quot; The charge against Terzoli carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $ 20 # 000 fine . After his arrest in June , Terzoli told reporters he was innocent . Kelly said the death-by-seal-bomb was a violation of the Marine_Animal Protection Act and difficult to accept because the animal had become accustomed to interacting with people . &quot; It was a sea_lion that was encouraged by people in that area to come_around and ask_for food , &quot; Kelly said . &quot; It had become tame. &quot; According to Kelly , seal bombs are devices similar to firecrackers , measuring about 3 1 / 2 inches long and half an inch wide . Fishermen may legally toss them in the water , where their blasts scare_off hungry sea_lions , Kelly said . Carolyn Heath , assistant_professor of biology at Fullerton College , said she has never seen a similar incident against a sea_lion but has seen animals with bullet_holes on occasion . &quot; It ' s an attitude problem , &quot; said Heath , who has led summer student groups from Orange County to Baja California to study sea_lions and marine wildlife . &quot; Are we the only ones allowed to eat fish , or do we share ? &quot; Renteria said the case is scheduled to go_to a jury trial Nov . 15 .</TEXT>
