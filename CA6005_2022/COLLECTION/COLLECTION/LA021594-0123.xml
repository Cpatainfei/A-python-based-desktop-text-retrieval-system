   <HEADLINE> NAVY TERM FOR ' KILLING '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once again , the Navy and government officials have come_up with another politically correct word for killing things . I refer to the Article of Feb . 2 on the OK for the Navy to detonate thousands of pounds of explosives off the Channel Islands . Their new word for killing whales and other federally protected species is incidental take . During the ex-President George Bush-sponsored war in Iraq , the word for killing innocent civilians was collateral damage . Why can ' t the Navy just say they are going_to kill things ? Robert H . Launius Channel Islands Harbor</TEXT>
