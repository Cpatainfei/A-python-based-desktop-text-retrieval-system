   <HEADLINE> NEWS BITES : I SAY IT ' S FLANK_STEAK AND I SAY THE HECK WITH IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For those who don ' t like the flavor of flank_steak , try this handy hint : Marinate three days in tamari soy and a little balsamic vinegar . It ends_up tasting remarkably like liver ! The Newest Mediterranean Cuisine Cuisine Baladi ( from the Arabic word for &quot; country &quot; ) is the fusion cuisine of modern Israel , combining local ingredients and Arab dishes with the influences brought by Jewish immigrants -- notably from Yemen , Morocco and India . Greater Galilee Olive_Oil Co. , which wants to make us Baladi-conscious , imports a luscious varietal olive_oil entirely made from the Souri olive , various flavored olive_oils , bottled olives and a number of interesting sauces . Among them are a well-made tahineh , an unusual orange chutney , several oil-less sauces ( including a curry-like hot and sour garlic_sauce ) and tart , appetizing sauces made from the Arab thyme and sumac mixture zaatar . Available in Los Angeles at gourmet and health_food stores such_as Bristol Farms , Erewhon , Mrs . Gooch ' s ; for mail_order or Cuisine Baladi recipes , call ( 310 ) 459-9120 or ( 800 ) 290-1391 . Safe Sponge Now it dawns on us . Yes , the Estracell II dish sponge ( Newsbites , Nov . 18 , 1993 ) retards the growth of fungus and bacteria , but this doesn ' t mean , as we thought , that it contains a bacteriocide . The polyester material that Estracell II is made from just washes several times cleaner ( and dries faster ) than cellulose , so it doesn ' t give the bugs so_much chance to grow in the first place . Pocket Pepper Pump The Bonny Portable Pepper_Mill is a pepper_grinder that looks_like , well , a white lipstick six inches long . The idea is that you put it in your purse or pocket and then whip it out at will for fresh pepper , without becoming obligated to a waiter for coming out and grinding some for you on one of those big mills . The cool part is that it works by pump_action ; it ' s all_in the thumb . At supermarkets and cookwares stores . What ' s It All About , Algae ? Omega-3 fatty_acids , found in the richer ocean fish , are thought to be good for your circulatory_system . So biotechnologists are planning on harvesting omega-3 from algae and then enriching poultry feed with it in_order to produce high-omega-3 chicken , turkey or even ( gasp ! ) eggs . Why use poultry as a middleman ? that ' s obvious : Nobody wants to eat algae . But why harvest omega-3 from algae in the first place ? Because that ' s where it comes from ; that ' s where fish get_it , for instance . I Need a Good Yak Wine You tell WineSelect for Windows what you ' re going to serve , and the computer_program suggests wines to serve with it , even generating a wine &quot; shopping list. &quot; Understandably , the focus is mostly French , but hidden away in its several databases ( which include a wine appreciation course ) is a lot of international information , including how to say a votre sante in a surprising number of languages , including Mongol ( tanai eruul mendiin toloo ) . It ' s $ 39.95 plus shipping from SkillMaster Software , ( 800 ) 949-6112 . Requires three megabytes disk_space and Windows 3.1 or higher . CHARLES PERRY</TEXT>
