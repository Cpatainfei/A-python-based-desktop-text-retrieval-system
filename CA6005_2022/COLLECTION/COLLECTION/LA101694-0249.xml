   <HEADLINE> IN KIDNAPING ISRAELI SOLDIER , HAMAS SHOWS A NEW SOPHISTICATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By kidnaping an Israeli soldier , Hamas held the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks hostage , undermined Yasser Arafat ' s authority and damaged the morale and pride of the Israeli military . Nonetheless , the Israeli government salvaged some pride , at least in the eyes of Israelis , by showing its determination to fight terrorism , though its high-risk rescue attempt tragically failed to free Cpl . Nachshon Waxman . In the operation on Friday , Waxman , three Hamas captors and one Israeli rescuer were killed . Hamas , whose military wing took responsibility for the operation , had managed within days to achieve several of its long-sought goals . Although the Palestinian fundamentalist movement had linked Waxman ' s freedom to the release of hundreds of Palestinian guerrillas -- including their spiritual and religious_leader , Sheik Ahmed Yassin -- the Hamas ' agenda was more far-reaching . Aside from sabotaging the peace talks , which aimed to extend Palestinian self-government beyond its limited authority in Jericho and the Gaza Strip , Hamas has poisoned the atmosphere between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization . The kidnaping of Waxman overshadowed Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s visit to the region and his mission to narrow the gap between Israel and Syria . No less important , the drama deepened the distrust between Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Arafat at an especially sensitive time . Both leaders , along with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , were named recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday . What enabled Hamas to succeed where it had failed time and time again ? The answer is a combination of timing and self-improvement . The kidnaping of the Israeli soldier was the second blow the organization had inflicted on Israel within 48 hours . Last Sunday , two gunmen , also members of Hamas ' military wing , opened_fire on a crowded and narrow street in a fashionable part of Jerusalem , killing two and injuring 15 . These two incidents showed , as Israeli military and intelligence_officers have acknowledged , that the military wing of Hamas has become an impressive , sophisticated and deadly guerrilla force . Hamas , which in Arabic means &quot; fervor , &quot; was formed by Sheik Yassin in late 1987 or early 1988 , about the same time the intifada began . Its founding charter contends that the soil of all Palestine is a wakr ( Muslim holy property ) that belongs_to Muslims forever . To Hamas , there is no place for Israel as an independent state of the Jewish people . The Hamas message also includes Muslim unity and enmity toward the West and modern Western culture . The mosques , religious_schools , clinics and community_centers that Israel ' s military administration helped to build during its 27 years of occupation of Gaza and the West_Bank became hotbeds of religious and political agitation , as well as centers for the recruitment and military_training of Hamas members . At the same time , Hamas secretly formed its military wing , known as Ez a-Din al-Kassam Brigades . It is named after a Syrian-Palestinian leader of the 1930s , whose ideology was a mixture of Muslim religiosity , Arab nationalism and the idea of jihad ( holy war ) against the_British government , which ruled Palestine at the time , and Jewish Zionists during Israel ' s pre-statehood . Eventually , Kassam was killed in 1935 , in a military clash with the_British forces . Mirroring their namesake , Ez a-Din al-Kassam Brigades declared jihad against Israel . After using knives and axes to indiscriminately kill Israeli civilians inside and outside the occupied territories , Hamas guerrillas embarked_on a new campaign in December , 1992 . Israeli soldiers , secret_agents and Jewish settlers became the preferred targets . Before Waxman , nine Israeli soldiers were kidnaped and murdered . Two of Israel ' s General Security Services agents were slain by their Palestinian informers . In these operations , members of the Hamas military wing disguised themselves as Israelis , occasionally even pretending to be Orthodox Jews , and used stolen cars with Israeli license_plates to lure their intended victims , some of whom were hitchhiking . Though Israeli intelligence has occasionally succeeded in planting informers , exposing its secret cells , arresting its members and killing some of its commanders in armed clashes , Hamas has become far more difficult to control . &quot; The Ez a-Din al-Kassam Brigades , &quot; admits a senior Israeli intelligence operative , &quot; maintain a highly secretive structure which is difficult to penetrate . They minimize contacts between the various units and use special couriers with coded messages for communication , which is hard to intercept . Their cadre is very disciplined and committed to their cause . They are ready to die for it. &quot; It is estimated that the brigades have no more_than a dozen active members . But the hard-core enjoys strong support from a large segment of the population , especially in Gaza . The Hamas also has offices in Jordan , Syria , Sudan , Lebanon and Iran , which has become a major source of financial_support . Israeli intelligence believes that Dr. Mussa Abu Marzuk , who studied engineering in the United States and now shuttles between Syria and Jordan , is the political_leader of Hamas . To a certain extent , his authority also covers the activities of Hamas ' military wing . The Hamas ' improved military_capability was clearly evident in how it handled the Waxman kidnaping . The corporal was abducted in the heart of Israel . His abductors managed to smuggle him to the Jerusalem area and place him in a shelter apparently prepared in_advance . From there , they succeeded in smuggling the videos showing the captive soldier to Gaza in an attempt to mislead Israel ' s security_forces . The tragic ending of the Waxman kidnaping may well add_to the movement ' s prestige in the eyes of many Palestinians as the only force that dares to fight Israel and save Palestinian honor . While Arafat emerges from the crisis as a weak and hesitant leader , Israel holds him responsible_for his lack of willingness to tackle Hamas terrorism , though he ordered the arrest of hundreds of Hamas sympathizers in Gaza in a vain attempt to find the kidnaped Israeli soldier . Hamas , on the other hand , portrayed Arafat as a traitor to the Palestinian cause , someone who has no power to stand_up to Israeli pressure . It is expected that Israel will soon try to take its revenge against Hamas . Israel will also continue its pressure on Arafat to handle extremists and fundamentalists among his people . Yet , most Israeli Cabinet_ministers know that they have no other serious alternative but to continue to deal with Arafat , as well as_to speed_up talks with Jordan and Syria . &quot; Only peace , &quot; said several Israeli ministers , &quot; can uproot terrorism and Hamas violence. &quot;</TEXT>
