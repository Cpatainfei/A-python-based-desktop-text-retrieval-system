   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; THE DEBATE ON BILINGUAL EDUCATION POLARIZES SCHOOL FACULTIES ; TEACHERS OPPOSED TO INSTRUCTION METHODS AIMED AT EDUCATING LIMITED-ENGLISH STUDENTS FORGET THAT THEIR OWN ANCESTORS OFTEN SPOKE IN OTHER TONGUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just when teachers begin to nod_off at a faculty meeting , someone mentions bilingual education . Eyes click_open , and teachers divide into pro and con camps . Regardless of their opinions , all teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District are receiving 24 hours of bilingual education training during four pupil-free days . Skip the mandated workshops and a teacher risks transfer or dismissal . Although all attend , many grumble so vehemently that they ' re not hearing the message . Instead they describe how their European ancestors learned English without any special help . This is America , and they shouldn ' t come here if they ' re not going_to speak English . Who ' s saying immigrants don ' t want to speak English ? Check_out any night_school and you ' ll find classrooms with standing room only . How quickly we forget that our Colonial ancestors lived_in a multilingual community and that assimilation took generations . When Benjamin Franklin promoted a program to phase_out all but English instruction in 1750 , the Pennsylvania Germans voted him out of the Colonial assembly . Bilingual education stayed . Despite the facts , there is little movement from one camp to the other . Everyone has an opinion , and few listen to anyone else ' s . During one of these compulsory workshops , Michael Genzuk , director of the USC School of Education Latino Teacher Project , hauled out some statistics . In the LAUSD , 86 languages are spoken . In California , 1 # 179 , 000 public_school students are identified as having limited English proficiency . that ' s 23 % of the state student population , and the number is growing . The Los Angeles figure is closer to 66 % . Our student population with primary languages other_than English continues to grow . And that ' s the message . Faced with the facts , opponents of bilingual education argue that it ' s impossible to teach in 86 languages . And they are absolutely right . In one of my English_classes my students ' primary languages include Vietnamese , Tagalog , Spanish , Mandarin and Egyptian . And there are only 20 students in the class . Although teaching to a diverse student population is a formidable task , it is not impossible . Although called bilingual , the workshops do not demand that teachers speak Spanish . They offer strategies for teaching in &quot; sheltered English , &quot; using devices which are helpful and relatively simple to employ . Things like slowing_down , repeating the same idea in different ways , using visuals to supplement the reading , previewing the text so students have an idea what to expect , connecting new material to curriculum already mastered . It ' s just good teaching . Nevertheless , there is a great reluctance to do what is perceived as dumbing down the curriculum . Outspoken critics , usually faculty_members who are closest to retirement , can be heard defiantly declaring , &quot; I ' m not changing , and you can ' t make me. &quot; Fortunately , their numbers are dwindling . The theory behind the compulsory training , and the hope , is that once educators confront the myths and examine the current school demographics , they ' ll be ready to learn the techniques for teaching a linguistically diverse population . Unfortunately , other issues cloud the debate . There ' s considerable resentment of the inclusion of politically correct hyphenated nationalisms which , I and many of my colleagues believe , further alienates us from one another and seems to endorse the non-acquisition of English . It doesn ' t help that the pro-bilingual advocates often insinuate that anyone who doesn ' t agree with them is a racist . Although sparks have been flying in the faculty lounge , teachers try to keep their frustrations out of the classroom . We aren ' t always successful . I share many of my colleagues ' frustration over the fact that , in additions to the curriculum , I must teach about sex and AIDS , must counsel kids in crisis , must try to steer them away from drugs , must watch for signs of hunger and child_abuse . In eighth-grade English we ' re working on manners . On bilingual education I sit in the pro camp . The other issues are matters_to be fought in other venues . The federal_government has to re-examine its immigration policies . Parents have to be educated to feed and shelter and love their children so the schools won ' t have to do_it . * Teachers have control only of their classrooms . And if the kids walking in the doors are unable to speak English , then we ' ll have to adjust our lessons , like it or not . The goal , after all , for both advocates of bilingual education and for those who ' d toss it out , is for all our graduates to be English-language proficient .</TEXT>
