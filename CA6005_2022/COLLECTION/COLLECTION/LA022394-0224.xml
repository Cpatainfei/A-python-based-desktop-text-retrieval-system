   <HEADLINE> DECIDING ON LIFE OR DEATH FOR O.C. ' S WORST MURDERERS ; JUSTICE : PROSECUTORS MEET IN SECRET TO WEIGH EVIDENCE , IMPACT ON JURY . CRITICS LIKEN PROCESS TO ' STAR CHAMBER. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of Orange County ' s ghastliest murders , a La Habra janitor is accused of walking into a Tustin office last year and dousing a woman with gasoline before setting her on_fire . If Jonathan D ' Arcy is convicted , prosecutors will seek the death_penalty . In another case that shocked the county , Robert Chan , 19 , is the alleged ringleader in the 1992 New Year ' s Eve murder of a high_school honor student who was bludgeoned and buried in a Buena Park back yard . Prosecutors want Chan to spend the rest of his life in prison if he is convicted . Such decrees on who should live and who should face the death_penalty are reached each month in Orange County -- but far from a courtroom . Instead , the decision whether to seek a death sentence against those charged with Orange County ' s most heinous killings is made by an elite group of veteran prosecutors who gather_in secret for high-stakes sessions , taking evidence and weighing the odds before reaching a critical verdict that is usually endorsed by judges and juries . In coming weeks , the panel of prosecutors will consider the fate of a Dana Point postal worker accused of gunning_down his mother and his best_friend during a shooting rampage across Orange County , and a Westminster survivalist charged with shooting two women to death at an embroidery shop . Many defense_attorneys praise Orange County prosecutors for their sensitivity in singling_out only the most aggravated cases for death sentences . But others complain that California law allows each county too_much discretion because there are no uniform guidelines for deciding to seek a death_penalty . Still others liken the process in Orange County to a &quot; Star_Chamber proceeding &quot; -- a reference_to a royal English court long abolished but notorious for secret sessions and harsh judgments . Assistant Dist . Atty . John D . Conley , the panel ' s ranking prosecutor who makes the final determination , said he ' s just interested in following the law . In his 22-year career , he has become all too familiar_with the savage work of serial_killers , brutal rapist-murderers and those who prey on children . &quot; There ' s no joy in doing this , &quot; said Conley , who sees his role as seeking justice on behalf of those silenced in death . &quot; I often think_about what the victims went_through in the last moments of their lives. &quot; What Tips the Scales The committee must weigh which defendants deserve to die for their crimes and whether 12 jurors are likely to agree before pursuing cases that typically cost taxpayers millions . They methodically consider factors that might tip the scales of justice in favor of life -- or death -- including the suffering of the victims , the defendant ' s age and previous criminal_record . Some cases are easy to decide , such_as that of Randy Steven Kraft , the Long_Beach computer consultant sentenced in 1989 to die for killing 16 Orange County men and boys , Conley said . While prosecutors refused to discuss pending trials , Chan ' s case clearly proved more troublesome than most . The death_penalty could have been sought in Chan ' s case , but some attorneys said they thought a jury would be reluctant to condemn a young_man who was a onetime contender for class valedictorian . The committee decided recently to seek the death_penalty against D ' Arcy . Authorities allege that his victim , bookkeeper Karen LaBorde , 42 , of Orange , died a torturous death after she was set_on_fire following a dispute over a $ 150 check D ' Arcy claimed was owed him . The decision by the Special Circumstances Committee -- a panel of seven men who have nearly 125 years of prosecuting experience combined -- is just one step_in the process that can lead to the gas_chamber or death by lethal injection . &quot; It ' s not the final_decision , but in many ways it ' s the most critical_point in the whole process , because they have the discretion , &quot; said Associate Prof . William Thompson , who specializes in death_penalty issues at UC Irvine . &quot; It ' s also the process that we have the least information about. &quot; A defendant is condemned only after a jury and judge agree that death is appropriate , and death sentences are automatically appealed_to California Supreme Court . Statistics show that jurors usually endorse the prosecution ' s request for the death_penalty . In 37 capital cases prosecuted in Orange County since 1984 , jurors have spared the lives of convicted murderers in nine instances . Statewide , Orange County ranks third behind Los Angeles and Alameda counties in condemning killers to death . Of the 381 inmates currently on death row , 27 men and one woman were sentenced by Orange County judges , according to a recent analysis by the state_Department of Correction . Orange County killers account_for 7.2 % of death row inmates . First Line_of_Defense Defense_attorneys are not required to appear before the prosecution panel but they typically do . Despite concerns that prosecutors may use the meetings to gain insights into possible defense strategies , attorneys rarely give_up the opportunity to plead for a client ' s life . &quot; We really see this as a bargain with the_devil , &quot; said Assistant Public_Defender Michael P . Giannini , who has appeared before the panel several times and likened the process to a star_chamber . &quot; Unless you change their minds , there is no advantage for you as the defense_attorney . But you just can ' t pass_on that chance. &quot; The tone of the hearings is always intense and emotionally draining , defense_attorneys say . Prosecutors are seated around a conference_table . Sometimes defense_attorneys are peppered with questions . Other times , prosecutors just listen . &quot; They just sit there like a group of Sphinxes , they are very hard to read , there are very few clues to what they are thinking , but it is not unfriendly , there is no animosity , &quot; said defense_attorney Jennifer Keller , who has twice appeared before the committee . Defense_attorneys present anything and everything that might sway the prosecutors -- or a jury -- including the facts of the case as they see them , details about the defendant ' s upbringing , abuse suffered as a child or psychiatric evaluations . Some attorneys briefly state why death is not appropriate . &quot; We ' ve also had presentations where there are videotaped statements from friends and relatives , paintings , drawings and poetry ( by the defendant ) , certificates of merit , report_cards , photo albums , &quot; said prosecutor Rick King , head of the homicide unit of the district_attorney ' s office and chairman of the death-penalty panel . Sometimes , defense_attorneys are successful . &quot; I can say there are times where I believe a case is a death-penalty case , but I have changed my mind listening to a defense_attorney , &quot; King said . He declined to elaborate . The committee meets and deliberates behind closed doors . Defense_attorneys are notified of the outcome in a a one-sentence form_letter -- delivered by mail -- and sometimes called a &quot; death letter. &quot; No explanation is offered . &quot; Not knowing always bothers me , &quot; said Keller , who unable to persuade the panel to spare D ' Arcy ' s life because of his troubled mental history . &quot; I would like to be given more information about what were the deciding factors . I would like to see the whole process opened_up more to the public. &quot; A Dearth of Diversity Critics say the way prosecutors decide death-penalty cases varies from county to county . In some instances , a single prosecutor decides whether capital_punishment will be sought . Critics call_for statewide , uniform guidelines on making such determinations . Some also criticize the lack of diversity on the Orange County panel , whose members are all white males . Of the 28 Orange County prisoners on death row , 16 are white , seven are Latino , three are black , one is Native_American and one is Asian . &quot; Diversity is important in everything , especially a decision like this , &quot; said Sacramento attorney James Thomson , president of California Attorneys for Criminal Justice , who said he has concerns that factors such_as race or economic status can play a role in determining whom is targeted for a death sentence . In Orange County , only experienced prosecutors who have tried death_penalty cases are eligible for the panel . As the office ' s two female homicide prosecutors and other deputies gain more experience , the makeup of the panel will change , ranking prosecutor Conley said . &quot; No doubt ( diversity ) would add an extra dimension , &quot; Conley said . &quot; But we believe experience in determining whether death is appropriate , or predicting how a jury will react , is more important than whether a man or a woman is involved &quot; in making the decision . Some defense_attorneys said that some murder victims appear to be given more &quot; worth &quot; than others when prosecutors are weighing a death_penalty case . &quot; You know when you have a murder involving a child , it ' s ' killing time ' &quot; for the defendant , public_defender Giannini said . Above all else , Conley said , prosecutors strive to be fair and consistent , judging each case on the facts and the law . Before the panel ' s inception in 1985 , the decision to seek the death_penalty often was left to the prosecutor who took the case to trial , Conley said . The panel was formed to ensure uniformity and provide the viewpoints of more experienced prosecutors , he said . &quot; It ' s a weighing process and everyone is treated equally , &quot; Conley said . &quot; While I have the final say , it ' s very much a group process , and I think we benefit from the long collective memory -- and the collective wisdom -- of experienced prosecutors , &quot; he said , adding that panel members sometimes disagree , but the majority ' s sentiments usually prevail . The committee ' s judgment is sometimes called into question by a jury . Recently , a jury deliberated one day before sparing the life of Shaleke Nasir , 22 , a kick boxer from Orange who was convicted of first-degree murder for bludgeoning , robbing and attempting to rape his girlfriend , Lena M . Forbes , 21 . Jurors said that while Nasir ' s crime was heinous , he did not deserve death . His sentencing is pending . Prosecutors involved in the process say their decisions are never made without careful deliberations . &quot; This is one of the most important things I do as a prosecutor , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert C . Gannon Jr. , head of the major fraud and consumer protection unit , who has also prosecuted numerous homicide and death-penalty cases . &quot; It ' s a very serious undertaking , &quot; King said . &quot; It ' s a tremendous responsibility to know that you are participating in a decision that has as its consequence the taking of a life. &quot; Deciding on Death The Special Circumstances Committee of the Orange County district_attorney ' s office reviews certain aggravated murder cases to decide whether prosecutors will seek a death sentence during trial . A jury and judge must agree before a defendant will be condemned . COMMITTEE_MEMBERS Assistant Dist . Atty . John D . Conley , 52 , makes the final_decision .
