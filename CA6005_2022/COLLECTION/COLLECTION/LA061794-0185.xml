   <HEADLINE> BROKERING VOTES FOR HEALTH REFORM BEGINS IN EARNEST ; POLITICS : SPECIAL_INTERESTS -- OIL AND TOBACCO -- STEP_UP LOBBYING . DEAL MAKING MAY BE ONLY WAY TO GET BILL PASSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hey , it ' s just a thought , Mr. President . Just an offhand suggestion on how to get_around a sticky little legislative technicality -- and one that might make_it a bit easier for you to get that health bill through Congress . Maybe all_the health bill needs is , say , a tax_break or two for the oil_industry . Upon hearing that idea , offered Thursday when President Clinton met with about 60 oil-patch lawmakers , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen &quot; just kind of put his head in his hands , &quot; said Sen . John B . Breaux ( D-La. ) , who had broached the proposal . Capitol_Hill hand that he is , Bentsen knew that -- as surely as the National_Anthem is followed by the words &quot; Play ball &quot; -- he was hearing the opening pitch_in a time-honored game . And the playing_field in this case -- health_care reform -- is bigger and richer than anything Congress has seen for a long , long_time . Nothing is as high a priority for the President -- and , therefore , no bill is likely to involve more incongruous trades to get_it passed . The nation has heard two years of soaring rhetoric invoking high moral_principle , a generation ' s duty to its sick and vulnerable . But in the end , it is likely to take scores of far-flung breaks for special constituencies to make the legislation happen . It might seem odd , for instance , that a congressional committee working to improve health_care would vote to lower a proposed tax on such a notorious carcinogen as tobacco . But that is precisely what the House Ways and Means Committee did Thursday . By a 24-14 vote , the committee scaled back Clinton ' s proposed 75-cent-a-pack cigarette tax increase in favor of a 45-cent increase , because that was the most that Democratic Rep . Lewis F . Payne Jr . of a tobacco-growing Virginia district said he would support . And the committee needs his vote , if it is to get any bill at all . Lawmakers are getting plenty of advice on what they should ask_for . Last weekend , while the rest of the Capitol was dark , no fewer than 70 lobbyists could be seen going_in and out of the Ways and Means Committee chamber with other proposed amendments to be considered by overworked Republican staff_members , according to a Washington Post report . In the largest sense , the crafting of the health_care bill will be an example of politics as the art of the possible -- and of the cynical . Asked about lawmakers brokering health reform votes_in exchange for oil concessions , Senate Finance_Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) deadpanned : &quot; Grazing fees come first with me. &quot; Moynihan can afford to scoff at those who must get their breaks by begging for them . As chairman of a pivotal committee , he can write his in himself -- as he did when he included $ 40 billion in aid to academic medical_centers ( of which New York has many ) in the legislation that will serve as his panel ' s first draft of health_care legislation . Breaux said that Clinton was noncommittal about his proposal to add oil-industry tax_breaks to the health_care bill . He and other oil-staters also vehemently deny any suggestion that their health_care votes might be tied to any special deals for the industry . &quot; I would not think there would be that much direct linkage . Health_care is too important , &quot; said Sen . J . Bennett Johnston ( D-La. ) , chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural_Resources Committee and one of those who met with Clinton . &quot; It may sweeten the pot a little bit for some marginal voter who is right on_the_fence but I just don ' t see the linkage. &quot; However , the oil-patch legislators also point_out that the oil_business is hurting and that it would take a tax_bill to ease its financial problems . By happy coincidence , the only tax_bill on the horizon is the health legislation . &quot; It ' s been done before , &quot; Breaux said , when it was suggested that the health bill could be loaded_down with unrelated goodies . The industry and its allies are seeking a series of breaks , including tax_credits to encourage production from new and marginal wells , reductions of penalties for pollution and measures that would reduce imports of refined products . On the oil_industry ' s side is one of the most formidable and savvy allies any interest_group could have : Rep . John D . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and one of the chief architects of the health reform effort in the House . Last April , Dingell co-signed a letter to Clinton that implicitly linked the issues of energy and health as &quot; two very important domestic policy concerns. &quot; &quot; In particular , two vitally important issues must be resolved this year , both of which affect the long-term economic security of this nation and its citizens , &quot; the letter said . &quot; Specifically , we are concerned with the economic devastation occurring in the energy industry and we believe that comprehensive health_care reform must be adopted during this Congress. &quot; Few in Congress are as skilled as Dingell in figuring_out where the votes are_on a bill , and what it takes_to get them . The version that he is drafting is laden with breaks for such important groups as small business and agriculture . He also made a high-profile concession that would weaken Clinton ' s proposal to give the government significant leverage over the prices of breakthrough drugs -- a move that allowed two freshmen on his committee , Reps . Lynn Schenk ( D-San Diego ) and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky ( D-Pa. ) , to claim a significant victory for the biotechnology firms of their districts . Both are facing difficult battles for reelection , and won wide praise from the businesses in their districts for winning the biotechnology breaks . But for all his maneuvering , Dingell still finds himself several votes short of a majority . Which means that the dealing is not over .</TEXT>
