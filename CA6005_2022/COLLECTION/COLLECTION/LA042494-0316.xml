   <HEADLINE> THE ELECTRIC_CAR : ITS TIME IS HERE -- AND SO IS ITS OPPOSITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After Times auto reviewer Paul Dean drove a state-of-the-art electric_car in 1991 , he wrote : &quot; Electric motoring is_best compared to softball . The equipment , rules and technique are similar . But the pace and excitement are far from the real_thing . . . . The ( 50-mile ) range of electric_cars restricts their roles to suburban puddle jumpers . Speed and acceleration are dangerously beneath the entrance pace of the Los Angeles freeway system. &quot; Fast-forward to last month , when Dean tested a car he dubbed Sparky -- the experimental Ford Ecostar van , which has a range of 100 miles between recharges . &quot; Throughout seven days with Sparky , we stopped for nothing except daily destinations . The little van not only ran at freeway speeds but actually passed many among the snorting , polluting , environmentally incorrect . It accelerated almost as well as the breeziest subcompacts and . . . held that performance whether the battery was 100 % charged or nearly flat. &quot; What a world of difference ! It ' s this sort of progress that ' s stiffening the will of the state and its Air Resources Board to require that zero-emission vehicles constitute 2 % of the new-car market in the 1998 model year and 10 % of sales by 2003 . The Big Three U.S. auto_makers , which have claimed over the years that seat_belts , gas-mileage standards and air_bags could ruin their industry , scorn electric_cars . But even as they lobby against the California standards they are reluctantly joining research efforts . They know that they could otherwise lose the whole market to public-private initiatives like California ' s Calstart . Now the major oil_companies , their gasoline sales on the line , are putting_up an anti-electric public relations blitz that puts the auto_makers to shame . The Times ' Michael Parrish wrote earlier this month that an ostensibly &quot; grass-roots &quot; protest against utility-company investments in alternative vehicles is funded by the Western States Petroleum Assn. , which represents oil_companies . The effort involves 200 # 000 letters to utility ratepayers ( about a &quot; hidden_tax on your gas and electric_bill &quot; ) , a petition effort and demonstrations at public_utility offices . The oil_companies have long argued that their &quot; reformulated gasolines , &quot; in conjunction with a new generation of catalytic_converters , are enough by themselves to reach California ' s clean-air goals . Another often-heard argument is that electric_cars won ' t really reduce pollution because electric_power plants will have to burn something to produce the juice . Opponents also argue from the consumer end that auto-addicted Californians will never accept the distance and performance limits of electric_cars , that the right battery hasn ' t been invented and that anyway it takes years to gear_up for production . Then there ' s the $ 30 # 000-and-up price_tag , to say nothing of the $ 2 # 500 to $ 15 # 000 replacement tab for a state-of-the-art battery . In a perverse way , alternative-vehicle advocates are happy about this burst of opposition . As they see it , only powerful issues attract powerful opposition . And , just as happily , they see answers to the objections . First , the fuel issue . Low-emission gasolines are certainly welcome ; indeed , they are the biggest part of the clean-air solution ; oil_companies that have been reformulation pioneers , such_as Arco , deserve great credit . But it ' s the zero-emission vehicles that take the necessary last step ; vehicles are the source of more_than 70 % of air_pollution , so that problem must be attacked at its primary source . A huge bonus of electric and electric / gas hybrid vehicles is that if California can produce good ones first , Europe and even Japan will buy them . that ' s the attraction for aerospace companies involved in Calstart . The former chairmen of Lockheed and Hughes Aircraft are co-chairs of Project California , an effort to focus state officials and business_leaders on finding industries for the future . And battery makers say production can begin easily by 1998 . As for reducing pollution , 35 % of California ' s power comes from plants burning natural_gas ; 20 % is hydro-power imports , and the rest is a mix of nuclear , coal and renewables like wind and solar . The result , say air-quality advocates , is that electric_cars are 97 % cleaner than today ' s autos . Investments now in such things as consumer recharging stations will turn a profit later as more vehicles go electric . And the batteries on the Ford Ecostar are recyclable . The consumer issues are serious , but they rest_on dated assumptions , among them that two-car families all want two long-distance vehicles and that innovative lease arrangements won ' t lure consumers . They also assume electric_cars won ' t keep improving fast and prices won ' t go_down steeply with mass production . Five years ago , CD-ROM was not viewed_as a consumer technology because of its stratospheric cost -- it was targeted at industrial and subsidized buyers , mostly schools ; less than 20 years ago , barely programmable two-head VCRs weighed 30 pounds , lacked remote_controls and cost $ 1 # 000 ; and 100 years ago , buggy makers were arguing about automobiles scaring the horses . Today , the thing to be scared of is standing_still . Go , Sparky .</TEXT>
