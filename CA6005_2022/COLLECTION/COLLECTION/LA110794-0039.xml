   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE ; TURN CAMERAS ON , GAG THE LAWYERS ; A SEASONED TRIAL REPORTER BELIEVES THE ATTORNEY MANIPULATION OF THE MEDIA JUSTIFIES HER CHANGE OF HEART .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Judge Lance A . Ito may rule today on whether the camera inside the O.J. Simpson trial room should be removed . I am a reporter who for 30 years covered more high-profile trials in this country than any other person I know . When cameras were introduced into courtrooms , I spoke out_in the press , on TV networks and on the radio in their favor , because I fought for decades to have more open courts . I did this even though I knew , as a print reporter , that the use of cameras and tape_recorders at trials would give TV and radio their first opportunity to take_over what had become the last great newspaper story -- the high-profile trial . But I believed then , and I believe now , that cameras give the public their real right to know what happens in the courts , and I urge Judge Ito not to black_out the public . But what I also urge him to do -- and I am making a complete and startling reversal of my lifetime beliefs -- is to issue a gag order on the lawyers on both sides . The worst problem of the Simpson trial emanates from what is happening outside the courtroom . As a generation of reporters who worked with me will tell you , I always instructed them to &quot; stay inside the courtroom , that is your job , to bring the public inside the trial , where a judge is in_charge and where the most important part of your story is what the jury hears from the witness stand. &quot; The out-of-court coverage has been appalling since early on , but for me it came_to a head recently . In what The Times wisely described as a &quot; carefully choreographed &quot; plan , defense_attorneys went outside the courtroom to denounce prosecutors for allegedly treating black prospective jurors differently than others . They did not make this accusation to the judge in court and in the presence of the prosecutors , but to the media alone . I would never have used such an accusation in a story until it was made in open court . But that was then , and this is now , and I realized to my horror that if I were covering the Simpson trial , I would have had to go_along with this manipulation . I find that demeaning , unprofessional , unethical . I do not fault the defense_attorneys . They are doing what they are paid to do , everything possible to win for their client , just as everything the prosecution says and does is to try to win a conviction . What I find appalling is the fact that at this trial , because of the overwhelming force of the electronic press , even a reporter who would not want to use any accusation until it was made in court is forced into doing so . That the media can be manipulated and pulled without protest into publicizing whatever the defense -- or prosecution -- wants them to do is wrong . It is going_to leave the media in even a worse position than they are right now , when polls show that the public has lost all trust in newspapers , TV or radio . There is only one way to stop the out-of-court acrobatics and that is to issue a gag order . This will astound the judges and lawyers and reporters with whom I worked . I have been unalterably opposed to gag_rules and fought through difficult times before the courts ruled that a judge may gag his court officers , but cannot gag the press . I used to say that only insecure judges issued gag_rules . Now , however , I am making a complete turnaround because of what is happening outside the courtroom . When defense_attorneys Howard Weitzman and Donald Re spoke on the federal courthouse steps where John DeLorean was_on trial , they mainly were filling_in the TV and radio reporters barred from the court . The prosecutors would have been wise_to do likewise . Those remarks were entirely different from the out-of-court statements , theories and accusations that the Simpson press has been feeding_on . Judge Ito , please give the public a break and keep the camera in the courtroom . Issue a gag order to stop the prejudicial comments being fed to an unquestioning and rather naive media . And , oh yes , sequester the jury . Jack Ruby ' s jury in Dallas was sequestered in the jail ; the Simpson jury could be given much better treatment in a hotel , and could concentrate_on the trial if they did not have to go_home every night facing possible contamination and family problems . ( What the Jack Ruby trial needed was not sequestration but a change of venue . But that ' s a whole other story. )</TEXT>
