   <HEADLINE> WILL JOIN NATO PROGRAM , RUSSIA SAYS ; MILITARY : STATEMENTS BY YELTSIN AND KOZYREV COME ON HEELS OF ALLIANCE ' S REBUFF OF BID FOR SPECIAL TIES . BUT THE TWO LEADERS SIGNAL DISAPPOINTMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite its obvious disappointment at terms offered by its longtime adversaries , Moscow is ready to enter a military partnership with the United States and its European allies , Russian leaders said Friday . At separate news_conferences , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and his foreign_minister , Andrei V . Kozyrev , stressed that Russia will sign the military cooperation agreement with the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . The accord would open the door for Russia to work with the West in such areas as joint military exercises , defense planning and peacekeeping operations . &quot; Certainly we will sign it , &quot; Yeltsin told reporters in Moscow . Kozyrev , speaking_to reporters here after addressing a meeting of foreign_ministers from NATO and many of the former East Bloc states , said he hoped to come_to NATO headquarters in Brussels &quot; in the near future &quot; to launch the cooperative arrangement . After extensive talks with Kozyrev on Friday , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher also said he expected Russian acceptance . The statements were significant because they came less than 24 hours after NATO foreign_ministers here effectively rebuffed Russian demands for a far more extensive agreement , including a formal political dialogue that many feared could give Moscow a direct influence within the alliance . A communique issued after a meeting of NATO ' s 16 foreign_ministers Thursday noted that the alliance was &quot; interested in a broad dialogue with Russia. &quot; But NATO Deputy Secretary_General Sergio Balanzino clarified that any consultations would be informal and on a case-by-case basis . &quot; It is natural that it is not to their liking . . . ( but ) we said no to them , &quot; summed_up German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel . But ambiguities in Yeltsin ' s remarks and a clearly unhappy Kozyrev left the impression that Moscow had probably not yet given_up its attempts to win a formal commitment from NATO that would expand the relationship to include talks on a broad range of European security issues as the price of its commitment to cooperate militarily . So far , 20 nations , the majority of them once part of the Soviet empire , have signed the military cooperation accord with NATO , an agreement known formally as the &quot; Partnership for Peace. &quot; But because of its size and power , Moscow has argued it needs a &quot; special relationship &quot; with the Atlantic Alliance that includes a formal political dimension . Besides gaining a say in alliance affairs , Moscow would like to use such a dialogue to reshape the current system of European defense agreements in a way that would effectively devalue NATO ' s role . For example , Moscow reportedly would like to upgrade the role of the amorphous , 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , transferring to it cooperative efforts in peacekeeping activities now being developed under the Partnership for Peace . At his news_conference , Yeltsin indicated that Moscow will pursue its demands for a broader relationship by trying to get commitments written into a detailed list of cooperative projects that must be negotiated as part of the program . He spoke_of the need for a protocol with NATO to deal with military aspects of the cooperative accord . At one point , he seemed to make_it a condition of Russian involvement . &quot; They will sign this protocol , and we will sign that Partnership for Peace document , &quot; he said . But then he added : &quot; Certainly we ' ll sign it . After all , even if some bureaucrats reject that protocol , we will sign it anyway. &quot; Neither Kozyrev nor Yeltsin gave any indication of when Moscow might sign the accord , although Kozyrev indicated that he wanted all negotiations on the details of cooperation completed before Russia signed the statement of principle committing it to the Partnership for Peace . &quot; I only want to come_to Brussels once , &quot; he said . Other nations involved in the program have committed themselves first in principle and left details for subsequent negotiation . Apparently irked at being rebuffed Thursday , the Russians held_up agreement of a final statement on Friday ' s meeting -- which included other non-NATO countries -- for more_than five hours with Cold War-style intransigence . &quot; It has been quite an experience for me as it has been for the other participants , &quot; admitted Balanzino , when asked about the Russian negotiating tactics . Injecting a sense of history into Friday ' s meeting , Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski urged Moscow to join with the West and not draw a new_line through Europe , saying : &quot; The decision of the former Soviet_Union not to participate in the Marshall Plan . . . was one of the factors clinching the division of Europe . We hope this mistake will not be repeated and Russia will join the Partnership for Peace , the program for the rehabilitation of European security after the period of confrontation. &quot;</TEXT>
