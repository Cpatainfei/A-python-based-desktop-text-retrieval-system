   <HEADLINE> FEAR SHROUDS AUTOPSY IN FUMES CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; What are you afraid of ? &quot; a reporter shouted . In a basement room , not far from a gathering throng of pathologists , paramedics , fire crews and hazardous-materials specialists , Chief Deputy Coroner Dan Cupido answered without hesitation : &quot; The unknown . . . the fear of the unknown. &quot; Late on Thursday night , doctors cloaked in heavy-duty safety suits -- in a building sealed_off by police tape -- began to perform the most extraordinary autopsy ever conducted in Riverside County or perhaps anywhere else . They were to open the body of Gloria Ramirez cautiously , hoping to determine why the 31-year-old cancer patient apparently emitted toxic fumes while she lay dying in a hospital emergency_room . The case of Ramirez , who died of a heart_attack Saturday night , has perplexed health officials despite nearly a week of investigation . The ammonia-like fumes were so severe that six emergency_room attendants at Riverside General Hospital had to be rushed to other emergency_rooms after suffering breathing difficulties and muscle spasms , and two of them remained hospitalized Thursday . Although officials were evasive about what they found in laboratory tests of Ramirez ' s blood , they told a crowded pre-autopsy news_conference at the Riverside morgue that they remain baffled . &quot; The one thing we absolutely know about this case is that very little is known , &quot; Tom DeSantis , a Riverside County spokesman , told at least 50 reporters and photographers who filled a basement conference_room . Through the day , the number of media on_hand from around the nation grew as interest in the mystery soared . Riverside County Supervisor Bob Buster , who called the episode &quot; unprecedented , &quot; added : &quot; The hunger for a thorough ( explanation ) of this strange event . . . has certainly overrun our medical and scientific abilities. &quot; It was hoped that the autopsy , scheduled when the building would be mostly empty , would begin to unravel the mystery . But county health officials acknowledged that the incident might never be fully understood . Dr. Humberto Ochoa , who stood next to the most seriously afflicted nurse throughout the incident , said he suffered no problems and did not notice the noxious fumes . He did , however , notice what appeared to be white crystals in blood drawn from Ramirez just before his colleagues began collapsing . &quot; I ' d never seen anything like that , &quot; said Ochoa , chairman of the hospital ' s Emergency Medicine Department . &quot; I have no explanation. &quot; Initially , authorities said it seemed likely that the fumes were caused by organophosphates , a highly reactive group of chemicals used in pesticides and nerve_gas . But preliminary tests conducted on the blood sample uncovered no evidence of organophosphates . Cupido , who said investigators were &quot; still dealing with an unknown , &quot; seemed reluctant to say whether anything unusual had turned_up in the initial tests on Ramirez ' s blood . &quot; Are you saying they ' re normal ? &quot; one journalist called_out . Hesitating , Cupido answered , &quot; I did not say that , &quot; but he termed it premature to disclose exactly what the blood analysis showed . &quot; We have reason to believe it was not a natural death , &quot; the deputy coroner added . Ramirez , who was in the advanced stages of cervical cancer , had consulted with doctors at Loma Linda University Medical_Center , but was not being treated there . It was possible , investigators acknowledged , that the fumes might have come from elsewhere , including a rinse basin located inside the emergency_room . &quot; Those are the kinds of questions we are asking , &quot; DeSantis said . &quot; At this point , we can ' t rule_out anything. &quot; In preparation for the autopsy , authorities closed_off two narrow avenues beside the quaint Spanish-style , ivy-covered coroner ' s office . Safety cones and yellow police tape divided Orange Street along its center stripe . On one side of the barrier , reporters and TV camera crews huddled outside their satellite transmission vans and clustered near the rear entrance of the building , hoping for glimpses into the mystery . On the other side of the police line , emergency teams prepared_for the moment when Ramirez ' s body would be removed from its airtight , aluminum casket and double layer of plastic body_bags . &quot; I don ' t think anybody ' s ever done anything like this , &quot; said Bill Redden , a supervising industrial hygienist for the Riverside County Environmental Health Department , as he showed reporters the arrangements -- including the 8-by-15-foot , plastic-lined enclosure specially created to house the examination . Two industrial hygienists -- from Riverside County and Cal / OSHA -- were to begin the procedure by removing the outer body_bag and poking small holes into each end of the inner bag , Redden said . Air samplers and a remote camera were to monitor the body for about an hour with no members of the autopsy team present , he said . The forensic examination was then to begin and would involve checking the skin and organs for chemical contamination and clues to the cause of death . The autopsy was expected to conclude about midnight . All four members of the team were to be wearing &quot; Level B &quot; safety suits , sealing themselves completely from gases in the room . Four members of a hazardous-materials team would be outside in oxygen_masks and protective suits , ready to rescue the others if necessary . According to a detailed report released Thursday , Ramirez arrived by ambulance at the emergency_room semiconscious with a rapid heart beat . Nurse Susan Kane , who was drawing blood , was the first to faint . Dr. Julie Gorchynski , who took_over , also passed_out , and soon afterward Ochoa ordered an evacuation . County officials said Ramirez received uninterrupted care . Rick Rice of Cal / OSHA said the heating and ventilation_system in the emergency_room had been checked and nothing was found that could explain the bizarre episode . A spokesman for the hazardous-materials team noted at the news_conference , however , that no one had checked the drains in the emergency_room . Gorchynski was removed from a respirator at Loma Linda University Medical_Center and was breathing normally , hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell said Thursday . Gorchynski ' s condition is listed only as fair , however , because she continues to have mild muscle spasms . Residents of Riverside who looked_on with curiosity Thursday expressed sympathy for Ramirez ' s family while puzzling over the strangeness of the case . &quot; God only knows , if they find something , how it might change the medical_profession , &quot; said attorney William Shapiro , who speculated that the worst-case scenario might be another &quot; AIDS-type epidemic. &quot; Times medical writer Thomas Maugh II contributed to this story in Los Angeles .</TEXT>
