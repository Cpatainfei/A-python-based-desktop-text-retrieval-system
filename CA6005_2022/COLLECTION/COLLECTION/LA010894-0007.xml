   <HEADLINE> EPA BEGINS STEPS TO PENALIZE STATE OVER SMOG PLANS ; POLLUTION : ACTION AGAINST CALIFORNIA COMES EVEN THOUGH STATE AND FEDERAL_OFFICIALS ARE CLOSE TO A COMPROMISE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration on Friday started the process of withholding federal highway funds and imposing other strict economic sanctions on California , Illinois and Indiana for failing to overhaul their state Smog Check programs . Under the action proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the federal_government on June 15 could freeze more_than $ 1.5 billion a year in highway funds allocated for the three states unless their lawmakers adopt bills that improve their policing of automobile tailpipe emissions . California stands to lose as much as $ 800 million a year . Among state officials in Sacramento , reaction was swift . Top officials in the Wilson Administration and some members of both parties in the Legislature attacked the EPA , saying the federal action was tantamount_to war . Mary Nichols , the EPA ' s assistant administrator for air and radiation , told The Times that the Clinton_Administration &quot; has no choice &quot; under the Clean Air Act than to take the action . The EPA gave California a two-month reprieve to fix its program in November , even though the Clean Air Act requires states to have more stringent car inspection programs in place by January , 1995 . Nichols stressed , however , that she is confident that such dire action will be averted in all three states . &quot; There is every reason to expect that we will never impose these sanctions , &quot; Nichols said . &quot; All we ' re doing now is starting a time_clock , which will result in sanctions next spring if we don ' t get a bill passed . But I emphasize that I think we will get one before then . I really want to emphasize how very preliminary this action is. &quot; The federal action comes at a time when a team of California legislators , Gov . Pete Wilson ' s aides and EPA officials say they are close to agreeing on a compromise bill that will be sent to the Legislature . The compromise is designed to clean_up the worst exhaust-belching cars without putting California ' s 9 # 000 Smog Check stations out of business . California ' s massive Smog Check program -- mandated by federal law and administered by state_government -- requires motorists to have their vehicles tested every two years and repaired if limits on smog-causing gases are exceeded . For years , the program has been criticized as being plagued by fraud and for failing to identify and fix the worst polluting cars . Although all sides agree that it needs fixing , the conflict between the federal_government and state officials centers_on how to do_it . Much of the debate focuses_on whether the same service_stations that administer the tests should be allowed to continue handling repairs . Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , a leading negotiator , said the EPA ' s move toward sanctions could anger so many state leaders that it will short-circuit the progress that has made . &quot; EPA is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory , &quot; Katz said . &quot; I don ' t see why the EPA feels the need to prove it ' s the biggest kid on the block . . . . Particularly for people who don ' t like the compromise , it could be a convenient excuse to go_to_war on this thing. &quot; James M . Strock , Wilson ' s secretary for environmental protection , called the proposed sanctions &quot; inexplicable &quot; and a &quot; foolish action by the federal government. &quot; Strock said the Wilson Administration now will have to &quot; take a second look &quot; at the proposed compromise because it raises &quot; a question of good_faith and even competence &quot; of EPA officials in the negotiations . &quot; We believe we are very close to an agreement ; we expected it as early as Tuesday . But now , with no reason I can understand , they imposed sanctions that are not required by law but lie fully with the discretion of the ( EPA ) administration , &quot; Strock said . &quot; At this point , one has to wonder if there is any point to continuing the negotiations. &quot; But Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) , who authored a bill revamping Smog Check and has been trying_for months to get state leaders to agree , said &quot; the EPA has been very patient and cooperative with California to this point. &quot; &quot; The ( sanctions ) process still allows plenty of time . . . to reach agreement on an acceptable proposal , &quot; he said . Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , co-author of the Clean Air Act , endorsed the move toward sanctions , calling it &quot; a wake-up call to Gov . Wilson and the California Legislature. &quot; Environmental groups also applauded the EPA ' s action . &quot; It ' s overdue and we ' re happy to see them do_it . It ' s a sign that the EPA will obey the federal Clean Air Act , &quot; said Gladys Meade , a longtime clean air advocate with the American Lung Assn . of California . The EPA will hold a public hearing on the sanction proposal March 3 at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power . The final action by the EPA on whether to impose the sanctions will come May 15 , and the penalties could go_into effect a month later , Nichols said . California is the furthest behind of the three states in overhauling its auto inspection program . The Indiana and Illinois legislatures , Nichols said , must make minor technical and funding revisions , while California ' s Legislature still must agree on a complete overhaul . The EPA believes that California should replace the thousands of privately owned Smog Check stations with a network of centralized test-only centers overseen by the state and equipped with sophisticated equipment . Cars that fail the tests would have to be taken_to independent mechanics for repairs . The EPA says separating the inspections from the repairs is the best way to minimize fraud and clean_up more exhaust . But Wilson and most legislators want to retain the 9 # 000 independent stations and enhance the program with random roadside inspections using a technology called remote sensing to catch the worst polluters . They say the EPA ' s approach of test-only centers would inconvenience motorists and be less successful in targeting the dirtiest cars . In the proposed compromise , 30 % of California cars would undergo enhanced testing at the centralized stations , increasing to 60 % in 1996 unless the state can prove the program of random roadside testing works . Nichols said some details are still being debated but that the compromise looks good to the EPA .</TEXT>
