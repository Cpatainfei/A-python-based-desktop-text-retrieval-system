   <HEADLINE> 2 KILLED IN S . AFRICA TOWNSHIP DURING VISIT BY ANC LEADERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gunfire erupted as a high-level African National Congress delegation toured this violence-plagued township Sunday . Two people , including a journalist , died in the shooting . Abdul Shariff , 31 , a South_African free-lance photographer on assignment for the Associated Press , was shot once and pronounced dead at Natalspruit Hospital in Katlehong . Witnesses said he was wounded in the back while running_across a clearing . Two other journalists were injured , and police said they shot to death one man and arrested three people while confiscating four AK-47 automatic_rifles . Township residents said at least two other people were also shot . ANC Secretary_General Cyril Ramaphosa and Communist_Party chief Joe Slovo led the delegation into Katlehong , one of South_Africa ' s most violent townships , after recent reports that ANC supporters were attacking each other . Within minutes after they started walking on a dirt road through a neighborhood of burned-out and damaged houses , shots rang_out from the direction of a workers hostel dominated by Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party , the ANC ' s main black rival . ANC President Nelson Mandela quickly blamed the government of President Frederik W . de Klerk for not cracking_down on such violence , which he said is a daily occurrence in Katlehong , 12 miles southeast of Johannesburg . &quot; There is no excuse for the police not doing their duty . . . . The police should not allow any people to fire at innocent residents , &quot; he said in a televised interview Sunday night . After the initial shots , gunfire crackled sporadically for 40 minutes from the area of the hostel and from AK-47s and handguns carried by scurrying township residents . There was no immediate information about the man killed by police or the other people wounded . Much of the political fighting that killed more_than 3 # 000 blacks last year , including 1 # 200 in Katlehong and the neighboring Thokoza township , stemmed from the ANC-Inkatha power struggle . Slovo said he believed Inkatha supporters started the shooting , and that although police were present in the township , none were near where the gunfire occurred .</TEXT>
