   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : GAMES END BUT SONG GOES ON AND ON . . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We interrupt the baseball strike for a not-so-brief musical interlude : &quot; Take Me Out to the Ballgame , &quot; on radio_station WJMP in Akron , Ohio . All the time . Seriously . Over . . . and . . . over . . . and . . . over . &quot; Take Me Out to the Ballgame &quot; is played non-stop on the temporarily former all-sports station during the baseball strike , one version with a twangy country instrumental , another with a Bruce Springsteen sound-alike , 72 times an hour for the 14 hours a day that the 1 # 000-watt station is broadcasting in the Cleveland-Akron area . The counter was at 16 # 359 as of 4:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday . &quot; We do provide air_sickness bags for our audience , &quot; said Bob Klaus , vice_president of WJMP , who is responsible_for the idea , for better or worse . &quot; If it overcomes them , they are free to use the facilities. &quot; Exactly what this is doing to the station ' s ratings is not known because they are not released until September . But Klaus , noting that the feedback from listeners who applaud the air_raid as a protest against the strike has been positive , said WJMP will stick_with &quot; TMOTTB &quot; until the owners and players reach an agreement , be that tomorrow or next spring . &quot; We ' re committed , &quot; he said . &quot; Or about to be committed. &quot; * Add WJMP : &quot; We ' re beginning to ask our audience to send_in their own audio cassette of ' Take Me Out to the Ballgame ' and we will put that into our play rotation , &quot; Klaus said . &quot; We are hoping to get a semi-truckload from around the country , and if we do , we hope to drive to Major_League Baseball in New York and dump it on their doorstep. &quot; The station ' s address is P.O. Box 2170 , Akron , Ohio , 44309 . &quot; Blame me or credit me , &quot; he says . &quot; It was either a brainstorm or a brain drizzle. &quot; * Trivia time : The 10th-leading active rusher in the NFL did not gain one yard as a running back in college . Who is he ? * Long-term planning : Organizers of the Vermont Sports Council realize they have little or no chance of getting the Winter Olympic Games before 2006 at the earliest , but they are serious about a bid for sometime after that . Their vision is that Burlington , Vt. , would be the host city and the site of opening and closing ceremonies and some events . The half-dozen ski resorts within two hours would also serve as venues . The success of the most recent Winter_Olympics in the relatively small community of Lillehammer , Norway , and at the far-flung venues that comprised the games in Albertville , France , and Calgary , Canada , convinced the Burlington group that it could stage a successful Olympics . * Trivia answer : Randall Cunningham , the Philadelphia Eagles ' quarterback , who has rushed for 4 # 096 yards . * Quotebook : Former New York Knick Earl Monroe : &quot; Sports is the only profession I know that when you retire , you have to go_to work. &quot; SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER</TEXT>
