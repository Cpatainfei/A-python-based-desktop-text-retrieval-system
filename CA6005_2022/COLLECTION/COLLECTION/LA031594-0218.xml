   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : BRUSSELS ; EU MEETS ON EXPANSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European Union ' s 12 foreign_ministers meet here today to try to complete negotiations with Norway on the terms of its entry to the union . The plan is to present the Norwegian entry application to the European Parliament on Wednesday , together with those of Austria , Finland and Sweden , whose terms of entry have already been agreed on . Proving even tougher to resolve than the entry talks themselves is the issue of what would constitute a so-called &quot; blocking minority &quot; in union voting . Britain and Spain are insisting on the present formula by which two big nations and one small one can effectively combine to block new initiatives . The others insist that as the union grows , so too must the blocking minority . Because the terms of entry must be approved by the European Parliament and subjected_to referendums in all four countries , both issues must be resolved this week if the enlargement is to take_effect as scheduled next Jan . 1 .</TEXT>
