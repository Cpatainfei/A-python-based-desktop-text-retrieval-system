   <HEADLINE> DIVIDED SENATE PANEL WRESTLES WITH HEALTH_CARE BILL ; CONGRESS : APPROVAL BY FINANCE_COMMITTEE WILL SEND THE DEBATE TO ITS NEXT PHASE . THE FINAL VOTE IS EXPECTED TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bitterly divided Senate Finance_Committee struggled on Friday night to pass a compromise health_care reform plan , one that fails to meet President Clinton ' s demand for guaranteed coverage but nevertheless would shift the hot debate into a new phase as Congress breaks for its July 4 recess . The committee ' s progress was slowed by a series of Republican attempts to restrict abortion coverage in the bill , and it adjourned late Friday night without a final vote . The panel was scheduled to resume work this morning . The emotional debate over abortion is sure to be revisited as the health_care issue moves through both houses of Congress later this summer . In the words of Sen . John C . Danforth ( R-Mo. ) , author of several of the anti-abortion amendments : &quot; the whole enterprise ( of health_care reform ) could founder on this subject. &quot; Considered a bellwether panel for the full Senate , the Committee rejected by a 11-9 vote a proposal by Sen . Orrin G . Hatch ( R-Utah ) to bar abortion coverage in health plans except in the case of a life-threatening condition or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest . But the committee did adopt , 12 to 8 , a Danforth amendment that says states would not be required to open abortion clinics in regions that have no doctors who perform abortions . By the same margin , the panel adopted a second Danforth amendment providing a &quot; conscience clause &quot; allowing employers to offer health plans without abortion coverage . In such cases , individual workers wishing to have abortion coverage would have to buy a supplemental policy , Danforth said . On a separate issue , the committee voted to impose a limit of $ 250 # 000 as the most that any victim of medical malpractice may receive for non-economic damages . The committee , which earlier in the week had rejected any requirement that employers pay 80 % of workers ' insurance costs , also killed -- on a 13-7 vote -- a 1 % payroll tax on employers with 500 or more workers , which would have been used to subsidize coverage for low-income workers . It also voted , 15 to 5 , to kill a tax on handgun ammunition that would have helped pay_for health_care . Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) had proposed the tax . The committee is expected to finish its work today , moving the focus of health_care reform to the full_House and Senate when Congress returns in mid-July . Three congressional panels have already approved varying versions of health_care reform , and the next step is for House and Senate leaders to meld differing bills together before the issue is debated on the floors of the two chambers . The White_House and its Senate allies will seek to resurrect the key features of the President ' s plan that have been stripped by the Finance_Committee , including the so-called employer mandate . Most lawmakers say they believe that universal coverage cannot be achieved if employers and / or individuals are not required to pay_for insurance . &quot; It doesn ' t matter ( what ' s in the bill ) , &quot; said one top Administration official . &quot; we ' ll do_it on the floor. &quot; The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee earlier passed a bill that contains many of Clinton ' s proposals . The President , in a letter to House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) , hailed &quot; a remarkable week . . . on health_care &quot; and noted that , when Congress returns , &quot; we will have the opportunity to give the American people what they need and want , and to give the American economy what it needs -- guaranteed private insurance for every American. &quot; The anticipated vote of approval by the Finance_Committee will conclude the critical first phase of legislative action on health_care reform . Although the Finance_Committee will be the last committee to act_on health_care legislation , its endorsement is thought to be particularly influential because its membership is more representative of the various factions that must be brought_together before any such measure can become law . To the chagrin of some senators , however , the price of passing a bill before the July 4 recess was a breakdown of bipartisanship . Republicans said the final measure will be almost entirely the work of Democrats and is being &quot; railroaded &quot; to a final vote with little consideration for GOP amendments . &quot; It ' s a sorry day for this committee , &quot; said Sen . Bob Packwood ( R-Ore. ) . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) also complained about what he said was more_than $ 200 billion in taxes over 10 years in the committee ' s bill , and he decried the rush to report_out a bill before the July 4 deadline set by Democratic congressional leaders . &quot; that ' s not the way this committee does business , &quot; said Dole , who chaired the committee in the 1980s when the Senate was controlled by Republicans . &quot; We spent more time on the B-2 bomber than on this bill. &quot; But Sen . John B . Breaux ( D-La. ) said committee_members have sat through &quot; countless meetings &quot; and 31 formal sessions . &quot; We ' ve talked enough about health_care to make us all sick , &quot; he said . &quot; We know the issues . We know enough to make the best decisions that are humanly possible. &quot; Earlier this week , a strong majority on the panel balked at imposing an employer mandate -- even as a fallback -- if other measures could not achieve virtually universal coverage . All nine Republicans and five Democrats joined to strike that provision -- proposed by Moynihan -- from a draft bill on a 14-6 vote . Instead , the panel voted , 12 to 8 , for an approach advanced by a group of moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats that would set_up a government commission to make recommendations for expanding coverage if 95 % of all Americans did not have health_insurance by the year 2002 . The bill includes provisions aimed at making_it difficult , but not impossible , for Congress to avoid voting on those recommendations or an alternative that it would select . But whether this provision can be resurrected on the Senate floor is unclear . The Finance_Committee also voted for a provision , bitterly fought by organized labor , that would impose stiff taxes on health plans that are more costly than the average for their localities . The proposal , by Sen . Bill Bradley ( D-N.J. ) would impose a 25 % tax on high-cost plans , paid by the plans themselves . Also on Friday , former independent presidential candidate Ross Perot confirmed reports that he intends to buy national television time for a program on health_care to be produced by the Republican National Committee . He said that Americans &quot; need more facts and less propaganda. &quot; GOP National Chairman Haley Barbour said Perot and his supporters &quot; hold similar views to those of the Republican_Party on health_care reform. &quot; He said the GOP program would try to &quot; advance the debate in a positive way. &quot; Dr. Bernadine Healy , former director of the National Institutes of Health and a recent unsuccessful Senate candidate in Ohio , will host the program . The unusual collaboration stems from Perot ' s and the GOP ' s dissatisfaction with Clinton ' s health_care proposals . Both Perot and the Republican National Committee contend that Americans are not getting factual information . &quot; The Republican_Party wants an opportunity to explain health_care to the American people . I have agreed to pay_for this television time so the American people can have more balanced information , &quot; Perot said in a statement . &quot; The program will provide an objective analysis of the health_care system in this country and how to improve it. &quot;</TEXT>
