   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ACCUSES U.S. OF ' DUMPING ' STEEL ; TRADE : OFFICIALS CLAIM UNFAIR PRICING AS THEY SLAP TARIFFS ON SHEET PLATE AND GALVANIZED LAMINATE STEEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> America ' s steel_industry , one of the most aggressive complainers about foreign steel &quot; dumping &quot; in the United States , found itself on the receiving end of the same accusation Tuesday in Mexico . The Mexican Commerce_Department slapped tariffs on two types of U.S. steel imports , arguing that the step was needed to prevent the United States from selling its products at unfairly low prices in Mexico . U.S. steelmakers accused of the actions did not immediately respond . The Mexican action comes at a time when the U.S.-Mexico economic relationship is expanding , partly as a result of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Steel tariffs are to be phased_out over the next decade under NAFTA , the pact designed to make North_America a single market in which most goods and services can flow freely across borders . Dumping is selling a product in a foreign market at a price lower than the price charged at_home to shed excess stock . It is a prevalent accusation in international trade disputes . Mexico ' s commerce_department said Bethlehem Steel , USX , Geneva and Lukens were hit with tariffs for sheet plate steel . The government also imposed tariffs for galvanized laminate steel that would affect USX , Mitsui , New Process and World Metals . The accused &quot; have shown that they were exporting to Mexico at dumping prices that have or threaten to damage the national industry , &quot; the Mexican statement said . Under NAFTA , tariffs on steel will be phased_out by 2004 , along with any on textiles , cotton , lumber and cosmetics . Duties on goods such_as glassware , orange_juice , sugar and peanuts are to be phased_out within 15 years.DUMPING ( TRADE )</TEXT>
