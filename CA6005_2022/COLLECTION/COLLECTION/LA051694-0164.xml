   <HEADLINE> NEW FEARS CITED OVER MARGARINE , OTHER FOODS ; HEALTH : PROCESSED ITEMS COULD BE LINKED TO 30 # 000 HEART_DISEASE DEATHS , NUTRITIONIST SAYS . SOME IN INDUSTRY CRITICIZE REPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An article being published today raises the possibility that margarine and other processed foods could be the cause of 30 # 000 of the nation ' s heart_disease deaths . The fact that margarine may be a major factor_in heart problems is not new . A year ago , researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health announced findings that margarine can increase the risk for heart_disease in women by as much as 70 % . But the numbers in today ' s American Journal of Public Health article were seen as alarming and came under immediate attack . The article was written by Harvard nutritionist Walter Willett , renowned worldwide as one of the leading researchers on diet and health disease . &quot; Will people be shocked ? I suspect so , &quot; Willett told the Associated Press . &quot; Many people who are trying to make_good nutritional decisions for themselves and their kids are being grossly misled. &quot; But others in the food industry were critical of the report , saying it was , in fact , an editorial and contained no new scientific data . &quot; This information has been worked_on for quite a while , &quot; said Susan Borra , a registered dietitian with the International Food Information Council . &quot; There ' s nothing new there. &quot; The article , done at the request of the journal , is labeled as &quot; commentary. &quot; In it , Willett posed the danger of what scientists have come_to call &quot; trans fats &quot; which are produced during the hydrogenation process . That process is used to make such items as margarine , shortening , cookies , crackers and chips . Doctors have long advised their patients to avoid saturated fat , found in both meat and butter . Instead , they have recommended polyunsaturated vegetable_oil , for which there is no known risk of heart_disease . Manufacturers , in turn , have used hydrogenation to solidify the polyunsaturated oils , making them easier to use in various products . Hydrogenation , in turn , produces the trans fats . While many foods are marketed as healthy because they contain no polyunsaturates , they do contain the trans fats that tend to increase so-called bad cholesterol , whose technical name is low-density_lipoprotein . It has also been shown to decrease &quot; good cholesterol , &quot; or high-density_lipoprotein . Willett said a number of foods carry &quot; egregiously deceptive &quot; labels such_as &quot; fat free &quot; and &quot; cholesterol free &quot; and &quot; cooked in vegetable_oil &quot; when in fact they contained harmful trans fats . He recommended that there be warning labels on food containing trans fats . &quot; Such warning labels are , indeed , more justifiable than those on cigarettes and alcoholic_beverages because the nature of the product is invisible to the consumer , &quot; Willett said . Ed Scarbrough of the Food and Drug Administration , said the agency is considering the labeling issue . &quot; The story about trans fat is still emerging , &quot; he said . In his article , Willett said he determined that the median U.S. intake of trans fats is 2 % of the daily number of calories consumed . He used that figure to calculate the number of people who would be subject_to heart_disease because of trans fats . &quot; Although the percentage of coronary heart_disease deaths in the United States attributable to intake of trans fatty_acids is uncertain , even the lower estimates . . . would suggest that more_than 30 # 000 deaths per year may be_due to the intake of partially hydrogenated vegetable fat , &quot; the article said . &quot; Furthermore , the number of attributable cases of nonfatal coronary heart_disease will be even larger. &quot; Willett also said that , like the tobacco_industry , the oil-processing industry claims the cause-effect relationship cannot be established without a randomized trial . He called such a trial &quot; ethically and logistically impossible. &quot; &quot; Indeed , in this country , further epidemiological studies will be difficult because the food sources of trans fatty_acids have changed so dramatically over the last several years , such_that even persons with stable diets will not have had stable trans fatty_acid intakes , &quot; Willett wrote . Meanwhile , industry dietitian Borra said the article has an alarming sound , while problems could be avoided altogether by sticking_to a diet in which the total fat intake is only 30 % of the daily diet . According to health experts , the average fat intake is 46 % of the average American ' s diet . She also said she believes the article should have undergone peer_review before it was published . Journal editor Mervyn Susser told the AP that the article did undergo internal peer_review . &quot; It ' s respectable scientific opinion , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
