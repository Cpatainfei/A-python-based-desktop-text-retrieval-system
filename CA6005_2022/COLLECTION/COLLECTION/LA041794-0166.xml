   <HEADLINE> FISHERMEN STAGE BLOCKADE TO PROTEST BAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly before dawn Saturday , about 15 commercial fishing_boats staged a brief blockade at the entrance of Ventura Harbor to protest a ban on gill-net fishing in coastal waters and other perceived hardships . At 5:10 a.m. , the Ventura-based fishermen assembled more_than a dozen 30- to 65-foot boats at the harbor entrance , blocking sailboats and sportfishing vessels heading out_to sea , Senior Deputy Harbor Master Dave Glaser said . The fishermen would not respond to the harbor master ' s radio calls , forcing a patrol crewman to take a boat out_to the blockade and ask the protesters to move along . &quot; We warned them that they would be arrested if they didn ' t disperse quickly , &quot; Glaser said . The fishermen complied and left the entrance just before 6 a.m. &quot; Most of them went_back to their slips , &quot; Glaser said . Bill Sutton , a commercial fisherman , said the protesters staged the blockade to express their frustration and anger over increased government regulations that they say have hurt their livelihood . He said the commercial fishermen assembled before dawn to stop sportfishing boats from taking anglers to the waters where they are struggling to make a living . &quot; We accomplished what we wanted to accomplish , &quot; Sutton said . &quot; If I can ' t go fishing , you shouldn ' t be able to go fishing. &quot; In 1990 , California voters passed Proposition 132 banning the use of gill_nets , which are anchored to the ocean_floor and stretched for miles to trap fish . Supporters of the ban said the nets posed a threat to marine mammals such_as dolphins and sea_lions . A San Diego Superior_Court judge last month dismissed a lawsuit challenging the proposition . Former gill-netter Hank Hubble said he joined the protest Saturday &quot; just to let the state of California know they put me out of business . I was protesting that I have lost my complete livelihood . My bills go_on and I can ' t work anymore. &quot;</TEXT>
