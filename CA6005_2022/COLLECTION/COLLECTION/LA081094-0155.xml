   <TEXT> Challenging the conventional wisdom about silicone breast_implants , researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said Tuesday that preliminary laboratory tests in a handful of women suggest that implants may actually help combat breast_cancer when the silicone seeps into the body . Reporting their results at a meeting in San Francisco , a team of radiology scientists found that plasma samples from three women with silicone implants -- long suspected of causing rheumatoid_arthritis and other diseases -- apparently killed breast_cancer cells in the test_tube . The radiologists cautioned that the results are very tentative and that more research will be necessary to confirm their findings . They added that they would not recommend the controversial implants as a way to fight disease . But , they said , their work does point scientists toward a new area of investigation : how silicone , or silicone compounds , might be used to treat cancer . &quot; You ' re always surprised when you find something like this , &quot; Leoncio Garrido , the research radiologist who led the research effort , said at a news_conference . If these findings are true , there is the potential for new types of drugs that can kill breast_cancer and other types of cancer. &quot; At least one prominent cancer expert was highly skeptical of the findings . Dr. John Glaspy , director of the Boyer Oncology Center at UCLA , said that other properties in the plasma -- and not silicone -- may have been responsible_for killing the cancer_cells . &quot; It ' s an interesting preliminary observation , but I don ' t think there ' s anything you can conclude from it , &quot; Glaspy said . &quot; The numbers ( of women in the study ) are so small that you can ' t tell that there ' s any correlation with breast implants. &quot; Thousands of women have filed lawsuits contending that they were injured by silicone gel breast_implants , which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned two years ago for nearly all cosmetic purposes . Earlier this year , the manufacturers of the implants joined in a record-breaking $ 4.2-billion settlement to put an end to the suits . Garrido and his colleagues reported their findings at this week ' s annual meeting of the Society of Magnetic_Resonance in San Francisco . They conducted two separate studies , one tracking the migration of silicone inside the body and a second analyzing how the blood of women with implants reacted with cancer_cells in the test_tube . The studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts General , respectively . The first study involved 32 women -- 26 with breast_implants and eight who served as controls . Using magnetic_resonance spectroscopy -- a technique for analyzing the chemical composition of tissue -- the researchers found that silicone from breast_implants travels_to the liver . There , it is apparently broken_down into smaller molecules containing silicon , the element upon which silicone is based . The concentrations of silicone and silicon varied from woman to woman . Although higher levels of each were found in women whose implants had ruptured , Garrido said that implants do not need to rupture in_order for silicone to seep into the body . The second study analyzed how the blood of five women with breast_implants reacted with cancer_cells in the test_tube . It found that plasma drawn from three women whose implants had been in place more_than a decade -- from 11 to 17 years -- killed cancer_cells ; two of those women had leaky implants . Plasma drawn from two women whose implants had been in place for less time -- about 6 1 / 2 years -- failed to kill the cancer_cells , as did plasma drawn from three women who lacked implants .</TEXT>
