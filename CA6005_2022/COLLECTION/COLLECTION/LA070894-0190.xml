   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; A WHOLE_LOT OF NIL GOING_ON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four big football games on_tap this weekend . The Orangemen are at the Cotton Bowl . The Vikings are in San Francisco . Two of the game ' s longest standing rivals meet in Foxboro . And Giants Stadium plays host to a classic tussle from the Black And Blue Division . In case you haven ' t received your latest issue of Pro Futbol Weekly , expect to see four low-scoring games , dominated by strong running attacks , defense , tackling and ball-control . And look_for the kickers to decide it in the end , each and every time.. . . BRAZIL-NETHERLANDS Site : The Cotton Bowl Line : Brazil by 1 / 2 Coaches : Brazil has Carlos Alberto Parreira , the_Netherlands has Dick Advocaat . At the moment , Parreira has very few advocaats -- not after millions of testy Brazilians watched their boys tie Sweden and go scoreless for 73 minutes against the United States . When Brazil has the ball : Brazilian journalists will be yammering into their cellular_phones , lambasting Parreira for benching Rai , for starting only one goalkeeper , for using 11 men instead of 10 ( it worked so well against the Americans , no ? ) , for getting Leonardo suspended and for not playing Pele . When the_Netherlands has the ball : The Netherlands ' two best players , Marco Van Basten ( out , sprained ankle ) and Ruud Gullit ( out , sprained ego ) will be nowhere near it . Key stat : The Netherlands routed Brazil , 2-0 , in the semifinal round of the 1974 World Cup . This has absolutely nothing to do with players competing 20 years later , but serious soccer journalists will insist that the carry-over effect is tremendous . Major edge_in momentum to the_Netherlands . Chance for international incident : Greatly diminished since a ) that Netherlands beat writer who joked about carrying a bomb aboard the Dutch team plane has been taken into custody and reprimanded , meaning no more plane evacuations and five-hour flight delays ; and b ) the Dutch are not playing the Germans . Prediction : 1-0 . ITALY-SPAIN Site : Foxboro Stadium Line : Italy by 5 / 8 Coaches : Javier Clemente for Spain and Arrigo Sacchi for Italy . Unless Italy is trailing at halftime . Then it would be Javier Clemente for Spain , Arrigo Sacchi ' s top assistant for Italy and Arrigo Sacchi on the first flight out of Logan to Paraguay . When Italy has the ball : Thousands of headlines for the next day ' s Il Manifesto and Il Giorno will be written and rewritten . Baggio dribbles across midfield . Headline : &quot; Viva Azzuri ! &quot; Baggio loses ball . &quot; Woe Is Italia ! &quot; Baggio tackles Spaniard , regains possession . &quot; Joy Is Ours ! &quot; Baggio slips_on a hot dog wrapper . &quot; Italia ' s Darkest Hour ! &quot; Baggio gets_up , wipes himself off , heads ball toward Spanish net . &quot; Comeback Of The Century ! &quot; Spanish goalie makes save . &quot; Tears Of Despair Bathe Our Streets ! &quot; When Spain has the ball : Fifty-eight million Italians hold their breath . Key stat : Spain is undefeated in games in which it scores a goal and the opposition does not . Chance for international incident : Very good . It has been 500 years and these countries are still arguing about who gets credit for Columbus discovering America . Prediction : 1-0 . ROMANIA-SWEDEN Site : Stanford Stadium Line : Romania by 0.425 Coaches : Anghel Iordanescu and Tommy Svensson . Let ' s see , who coaches where . . . . When Romania has the ball : Play-by-play commentary to pop aspirin to . &quot; Petrescu to Lupescu . . . over to Popescu . . . crossing pass to Dumitrescu . . . who waves at Iordanescu . . . back to Petrescu . . . who runs_into Popescu . . . I escu , wasthatamiscue ? &quot; When Sweden has the ball : Watch_out Tomas Brolin , Sweden ' s preeminent &quot; withdrawn striker. &quot; Which is saying something , considering Sweden leads the world in withdrawn strikers . Key stat : Swedes are undefeated since midfielder Klas Ingesson plowed his car into a moose in May . Chance for international incident : Virtually nil . This rivalry ' s been nowhere since Borg and Nastase retired . Prediction : 1-0 . BULGARIA-GERMANY Site : Giants Stadium Line : Germany by 0.5667 Coaches : Dimitar Penev for Bulgaria , Berti Vogts for Germany . Penev coaches traditional European football -- pack the defense in , counterattack when possible , build around the goalkeeper . Vogts coaches traditional American_football -- blitz the guy with the ball , sack him , pound him , whack him in the head , knock his teeth loose . . . and advance to the quarterfinals because the referee isn ' t looking . When Bulgaria has the ball : It had better duck and cover , especially when it traipses inside the German penalty area . When Germany has the ball : German fans begin to yawn . What they want to see are Bulgarians eating grass , Bulgarians wrapped around the goalpost , Bulgarians getting carted_off the field . Action , Berti , action ! Key stat : Germany is winless in the last two world_wars . Chance for international incident : Downgraded , if the reports from FIFA are to be believed . According to FIFA , the referee for the Bulgaria-Germany game will be permitted to wear a whistle , and blow it , unlike the referee for the Belgium-Germany game . Prediction : 1-0 ( in penalty kicks ) .</TEXT>
