   <HEADLINE> U.S. RULES_OUT IMMEDIATE MILITARY_ACTION IN HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : ADMINISTRATION WILL RELY INSTEAD ON STEPPED-UP SANCTIONS TO DRIVE_OUT THE REGIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has decided against immediate military_action in Haiti , hoping instead that stepped-up economic and political sanctions can drive the military regime from power there , senior officials said Tuesday . After weeks of debate between White_House aides seeking a quick solution to the Haiti impasse and a Pentagon wary of using force , the Administration has settled_on a series of diplomatic actions in hopes that the sanctions can be made effective , they said . President Clinton may reopen the internal debate over military intervention if the sanctions fail , but he has set no deadline for that decision , the officials said . Meanwhile , they said , the Administration is trying to make the sanctions work -- and seeking commitments for a multinational peacekeeping force of 2 # 000 to 4 # 000 troops to pacify Haiti if the regime falls . &quot; We really do want to find a peaceful multilateral solution in Haiti , &quot; Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott said after returning from a trip to Latin_America that focused_on efforts to tighten the sanctions . Talbott , the Administration ' s diplomatic point_man on the issue , argued that new U.N.-sponsored sanctions can succeed in driving the Haitian military regime from power , despite the doubts of the policy ' s critics . He said the Administration has made progress in winning support from Latin_American countries for the new sanctions . And , he said , several countries have agreed to contribute to a new , more muscular U.N. peacekeeping force that would police the island once the military regime is toppled . &quot; That . . . sends a tough signal to them that the international community is serious about this , &quot; he said . &quot; It also sends a signal to the many Haitians that are staying in their country that there is hope for the future. &quot; Talbott and other officials refused to say which countries have agreed to participate . But Canada , France , Venezuela and Argentina have all been involved in discussions about the peacekeeping force . The new force is being designed as an &quot; expanded &quot; version of the U.N.-sponsored military_training force , which was scheduled to land in Haiti in October but turned_back when armed Haitian thugs gathered at the dock . Some countries said , however , that they would participate only after a peaceful transfer of power in Haiti and warned that they might not join if the United States invades the island , one official said . The Organization of American_States , meeting in Brazil , passed a resolution Tuesday endorsing the expanded force and urging all its members to join the stepped-up economic embargo . The OAS resolution was something of a diplomatic victory for the Administration . Some Latin_American countries initially sought a resolution formally ruling_out any use of military_force in Haiti , but Talbott and other U.S. officials lobbied to avoid such a prohibition . U.S. officials explained that even though Clinton has not decided on military_action , he does not want to face an OAS prohibition -- and , more immediately , he does not want to relax pressure on the Haitian military by taking the option off the table . Some foreign_policy aides , frustrated by the failure of previous sanctions to budge the military regime , had urged that military intervention be actively considered . Although Defense_Secretary William J . Perry dismissed the idea , Pentagon officials later acknowledged that they had been forced to consider the step because of the depth of Clinton ' s commitment to solving the Haiti issue . The main new sanctions against Haiti include a complete trade_embargo , including efforts to stop smuggling across the nation ' s border with the Dominican_Republic ; a ban on commercial air flights ; a halt to financial transactions ; a freeze on overseas financial assets of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , Haiti ' s military ruler , and others in the regime , and cancellation of the entry visas of the rulers and their relatives . In additional moves to enforce the sanctions , the Pentagon said it may send a small number of U.S. troops to the Dominican_Republic to maintain helicopters and other equipment for the trade_embargo . Officials said they have decided to move ahead with plans for a U.S.-funded ship-borne radio_station to allow exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to broadcast to his people . &quot; What is important now is that we are seeing more cooperation from other countries in implementing the sanctions as well , &quot; one official said . But the United States has also been slow . Aristide ' s chief U.S. adviser , former Rep . Michael D . Barnes , said the State_Department canceled Cedras ' wife ' s U.S. visa -- which she had used for shopping trips to Miami -- only last week .</TEXT>
