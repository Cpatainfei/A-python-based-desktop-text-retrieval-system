   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / VIN WEBER : DEFENSE CUTS IGNORE CHANGE IN REALITIES ; WE can ' t CLAIM ANY ' PEACE DIVIDEND ' WHILE FACING NEW AND MORE COMPLICATED THREATS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the end of the Cold_War , a consensus emerged in Washington that , with the Soviet threat removed , America could cut defense spending and enjoy a &quot; peace dividend &quot; in the 1990s . It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that our rush to claim this peace dividend may have been premature . Events over the past several years have shattered the illusion that the post-Cold War world will be one of increasing peace , security and stability . From the war with Iraq ( and the discovery of Iraq ' s advanced nuclear-weapons program ) to our current nuclear showdown with North_Korea , we are finding that the United States will face new and much more complicated threats to its security as we approach the dawn of the 21st Century . Alarmingly , the debate over how to restructure our national defenses on the post-Cold War era has not kept_up with this changing reality . The President ' s defense budget , which the House Budget Committee voted to cut by an additional $ 225 million this month , recklessly slashes spending on areas of increasing importance such_as conventional preparedness and strategic defense . The Administration ' s critics , for the most part , are busy arguing that with the Soviet threat gone , the Clinton plan does not cut deeply enough . Instead of debating how deeply we can cut our defenses , we should be discussing what the emerging threats to our national security will be in the new millennium , and how we must prepare to meet them . These threats are ominous indeed . Consider some of the new realities of the post-Cold War world : * The quickening spread of high-tech &quot; super weapons &quot; ( nuclear , chemical and biological ) means that , in the not-too-distant future , small terrorist states armed with advanced weapons of increasing range and lethality will be capable of posing a direct threat to the continental United States . Until now , the only potential adversaries ever to possess this capability were the Soviet_Union and China . * Increasing access to nuclear technology means we will soon enter the age of nuclear terrorism . We should heed the words of Abul Abbas , leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front , who on the eve of the Gulf War warned America : &quot; Revenge takes 40 years ; if not my son , then the son of my son will kill you . Someday we will have missiles that can reach New York. &quot; * As Russia ' s democratic future looks increasingly uncertain , we face a very real risk that Russia ' s imperialist impulse could flare anew one day -- and with it the security threat posed by the former Soviet_Union ' s nuclear arsenal . Despite all these nuclear threats , the recently released Clinton budget reduces spending on strategic defenses by $ 22.9 billion -- a cut of more_than half . Programs designed to protect the United States from nuclear attack have been all but eliminated . These deep cuts will seriously undermine America ' s basic ability to fight and win even one conventional conflict . A secret study recently conducted by the Army ' s Training and Doctrine Command warns that shortages are looming in such mundane but vital areas as fuel pumps , fuel trucks , chemical-weapons detectors , medical-evacuation helicopters , amphibious barges for landing troops and equipment , scanners for reading bar_codes on ammunition shipping containers and mine-clearing equipment . We cannot allow such deterioration . It is time to begin a dialogue over the wisdom of this defense build-down , and to consider the possibility that protecting our national interest in the post-Cold War era may require a greater , not lesser , financial commitment . Is the United States today prepared to deal with a future Saddam Hussein armed , not with weak and inaccurate Scud missiles , but with nuclear ICBMs ? Could we respond to a North_Korean invasion of South_Korea or a North_Korean nuclear assault on Japan ? Could we fight and win simultaneous conventional conflicts in Korea and , for example , Iraq ? Could the Untied States even repeat its performance in_Operation Desert Storm today ? These are the questions we should be focusing_on -- not how much savings we can get from the defense budget . Assuring our military preparedness for the national security challenges of the 21st Century cannot be done on the cheap . If we do not refocus the debate to address questions of security instead of savings , we may soon find America ' s military capacity inadequate to ensure our peace and safety in the new millennium .</TEXT>
