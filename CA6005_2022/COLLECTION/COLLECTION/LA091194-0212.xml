   <HEADLINE> POVERTY IS LATEST BATTLEFRONT FOR SOME MILITARY FAMILIES ; ASSISTANCE : FOOD_STAMPS , OTHER FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS AND SECOND JOBS HELP SOME SAILORS AT LOCAL BASES SUPPLEMENT THEIR LOW SALARIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By night , Airman James Long works in an aircraft hangar at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station , keeping precise maintenance records of F-14 Tomcat fighter jets . By day , the 23-year-old sailor sells computers at a local_department store to supplement his $ 1 # 300 monthly Navy salary . His wife , Lauri , is busy taking_care of the couple ' s infant son and 4-year-old daughter . But she does what she can by clipping coupons and being a careful shopper at the base commissary . Because of his low rank and corresponding low pay , Long ' s family is qualified to collect about $ 80 a month in food coupons under the federal Women , Infants and Children program to ensure the good nutrition of their growing family . &quot; We ' re budgeted down to the penny , &quot; Lauri Long said . &quot; We tend to eat a lot of salad , chicken and leftovers . If I had to shop_at a regular supermarket and not at the commissary , we ' d be in trouble. &quot; While better_off than some , the Longs aren ' t alone with their financial hardships among military families . In Ventura County , more_than $ 63 # 000 in food_stamps and $ 32 # 000 in WIC coupons were redeemed by local Navy families last year -- the lion ' s share at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme . Throughout the armed_services , more_than $ 27 million in food_stamps passed_through military commissaries last year . The federal WIC program gave_out about $ 15 million in coupons to military families in 1993 , a $ 2.5-million increase from the year before . Although Navy officials at Port Hueneme or Point Mugu will not say exactly how many sailors were_on food_stamps , citing confidentiality laws , they estimated that as_many as 15 families on the bases depend_on food_stamps to get_by . The low pay_rates of enlisted personnel are beginning to draw the attention of top commanders who are concerned that money problems may distract soldiers or sailors from focusing completely on their jobs , said Pentagon spokesman Lt . Col . Doug Hart . &quot; It ' s very much a concern , &quot; Hart said . &quot; You can ' t expect people to perform their jobs well if they ' re worried about what ' s going_on at_home . Some of the jobs we do can get you hurt real fast if you ' re not concentrating. &quot; The issue has also caught the attention of Rep . Elton Gallegly ( R-Simi Valley ) , who last month introduced a bill that proposes a 16-member federal commission to study military pay_rates . &quot; More and more , the men and women who have agreed to potentially lay_down their lives for their country are finding that along with the uniform may come a losing battle with poverty , &quot; Gallegly said . * Navy families in Ventura County also seek financial_aid from a Navy relief organization which provides free food , small loans and cash donations . Dianne Kerekffy , executive_director of the Navy / Marine Corps Relief Society that serves both Point Mugu and Port Hueneme , said local Navy families received more_than $ 129 # 000 in short-term loans in 1993 . An additional $ 23 # 400 in grants was handed_out to needy sailors at both bases . &quot; We don ' t want them to become dependent_on us to get_by month to month , &quot; Kerekffy said . &quot; But , at_the_same_time , we ' re here for them as a resource. &quot; Each month , truckloads of food are distributed through the society ' s food locker at Port Hueneme -- a service available to any service member in the county . Likewise , sailors are referred to community-based food pantries for help during tight times . Gallegly said he thinks it is unfair to pay some military_personnel so poorly that they have to worry about feeding their families . &quot; This is an issue of equity , &quot; Gallegly said . &quot; These people shouldn ' t have to be_on welfare . I ' m not saying they all should be driving Corvettes , but they shouldn ' t have to worry about feeding their families either. &quot; Gallegly ' s bill , if enacted , would give the commission $ 750 # 000 and six months time to prepare a report on the issue . That report could then be used by Congress and the President as a blueprint for military pay reform , he said . The legislation is awaiting a hearing date before the House Armed Services Committee . Meanwhile , the issue of low pay is gaining momentum within the Department_of_Defense as military_leaders become focused_on improving the quality_of_life for enlisted personnel . &quot; The message is that money is tight and we are choosing people over systems , &quot; Deputy Defense_Secretary John M . Deutch said during a press briefing late last month . &quot; For example , if we must delay chemical lasers in space in favor of housing for our enlisted people , then ( Secretary_of_Defense William ) Perry and I will do so. &quot; Although Congress earlier this year approved a 2.2 % pay hike for the military and may approve a larger increase next year , the gap between military and civilian pay_for comparable jobs is ever widening . Even with the congressionally sponsored pay increase , military salaries are not keeping pace with inflation , officials said . Living_on base at Point Mugu , Airman Long and his wife , Lauri , said they would gladly accept food_stamps if they could get them . But like so many others stationed at Port Hueneme or Point Mugu , they make too_much money or have too many assets to qualify . In many cases , local Navy financial counselors say , simply owning a car , receiving an off-base housing allowance or having a part-time civilian job can push Navy personnel into a higher-income category that prevents them from collecting food_stamps . Kenlyn Christenot , a financial educator and counselor at Point Mugu , said that perhaps as_many as two to three times the number of Navy families that receive assistance could actually use food_stamps if they qualified . * Christenot said that to qualify for the federal food_stamp program , families can have no more_than $ 2 # 000 in personal assets . Owning vehicles worth more_than $ 4 # 500 also disqualifies families from receiving aid . Likewise , if they live_off base , their Navy housing allowance is normally sufficient to block them from receiving help . &quot; There ' s no way we would qualify , &quot; Long said . &quot; Yet if we didn ' t have a car and I didn ' t work part time , we would be worse off than we are now . The food_stamp qualifications don ' t make a lot sense in my opinion. &quot; The federal WIC program , which is initiated by a doctor ' s referral and which is generally easier to qualify for , pays_out less per family . The WIC program is oriented toward helping younger , poorer families supplement their children ' s nutritional needs . LeOra Stevenson , the Navy ' s family services director at the Port Hueneme Seabee base , said that younger Navy families stationed in this area have a tough time making their limited salaries stretch to accommodate the region ' s high cost_of_living . &quot; Compared to some of the places these people have been , Southern California is a very high-cost area , &quot; Stevenson said . &quot; We try to teach them that they have to very , very carefully manage their money here. &quot; Aside from the two family service centers at the bases , the Navy also offers financial counseling -- a program that Navy officials says is helping more sailors manage their money better . Navy officials said most needy families depend_on the incomes of a sailor ranked as a petty_officer or lower . Very few officers need help , they said . But for the Longs , the stress of worrying about money exacts a high toll in stress . &quot; Don ' t get me wrong , I love what I do and I love serving my country , &quot; Long said . &quot; But it ' s tough to make ends meet with a newborn . Lauri and I have found money to be a big source of our arguments , ( but ) I think we ' re going to make_it though. &quot;</TEXT>
