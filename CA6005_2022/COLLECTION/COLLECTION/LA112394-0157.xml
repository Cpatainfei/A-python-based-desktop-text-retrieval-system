   <HEADLINE> REICH CALLS_ON GOP TO ADD ' CORPORATE WELFARE ' TO CUTS ; BUDGET : PROPOSAL TO TRIM BUSINESS ' INCENTIVES ' MAY HAVE WON THE LABOR_SECRETARY SOME REPUBLICAN ALLIES . WHITE_HOUSE STEPS BACK FROM PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich challenged the new Republican Congress on Tuesday to scale back business tax_breaks and other forms of &quot; corporate welfare &quot; at_the_same_time that it tries to reduce assistance to the poor . The provocative proposal caught the Clinton_Administration off_guard and potentially won Reich some unlikely allies among conservative Republicans . Reich said that the federal_government could increase its revenues significantly by doing_away_with various tax_deductions , credits and other &quot; incentives &quot; that reduce the corporate income_taxes paid by American businesses . &quot; Since we are committed to moving the disadvantaged from welfare to work , why not target corporate welfare as well ? &quot; Reich declared in a keynote economic speech to members of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council . The speech reflected a desire on the part of some top Administration officials to press GOP lawmakers to direct their budget-cutting at some beneficiaries of government largess that Republicans have traditionally protected . &quot; Everything should be_on the table , &quot; Reich said in an interview later . He refused to specify programs or tax loopholes that should be eliminated . President Clinton took a step back from his labor_secretary ' s challenge to Congress to cut corporate and agricultural subsidies , saying that he had made &quot; absolutely no decision about any of the specifics in Secretary Reich ' s proposal. &quot; Clinton said , however , that a Democratic Leadership Council proposal with more specifics on cutting corporate subsidies and tax_breaks that Reich cited in his speech is &quot; conceptually . . . an attractive idea. &quot; He said that he would take the proposal into consideration as he prepares the fiscal 1996 budget_for submission to Congress early next year . Reich may have unusual allies for the campaign to strike special tax_benefits for particular industries . Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) indicated his willingness Monday to go_after what he called &quot; corporate subsidies , &quot; including subsidized interest_rates and direct_loans from the Small Business Administration . But while Reich proposed using savings from such cuts_to pay_for education and job training to foster a more solid middle_class and lessen the growing gap between the affluent and the rest of society , Gramm suggested using it to fund a capital_gains tax cut . Larry Neal , Gramm ' s press spokesman , said that there may be some room for cooperation with Reich , but that the senator is withholding judgment . &quot; We ' re not sure what Secretary Reich is talking_about , &quot; Neal said . &quot; I suspect as usual the Administration does not mean what it says. &quot; Business lobbyists cautioned that cutting benefits to industries so that Americans can get job training may be self-defeating . &quot; I would tell you for a lot of industries , what he may consider a special break they consider essential for their survival , &quot; said John Satagaj , president of the Small Business Legislative_Council , a coalition of 100 trade associations . &quot; It ' s fine to talk_about worker-training programs but if there are no jobs to place them in because you ' ve destroyed the industries they would have worked in , what good have you done ? &quot; Pro-business analysts and Republicans suggested that Reich should first consolidate and improve the scores of training_programs funded by the federal_government and prove their efficacy before asking_for more of the taxpayers ' money . Reich cited a report by the Democratic Leadership Council ' s research arm , the Progressive Policy Institute , which pinpointed savings over five years of $ 225 billion in government subsidies and tax_breaks , which help the energy , agriculture , transportation and high-tech industries , companies doing business in Puerto Rico and others . The institute ' s proposed cuts range from canceling the National Aeronautics and Space Administration space_station program to eliminating subsidies for wealthy farmers and closing the tax loophole that allows businesses to depreciate rental housing at a different rate than other structures . While proposing such cuts as a &quot; powerful theme for the 104th Congress , &quot; Reich called_on two conservative think_tanks , the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute , to come_up with their own proposals on the subject . Conservative analysts and Republican staff_members on Capitol_Hill generally agreed with Reich that , if Congress decides to cut welfare for the poor , it should also cut the safety net for the corporate world , including agriculture subsidies , the Export-Import Bank , Commerce_Department programs and other programs . &quot; It would only be fair and just if we ' re cutting welfare to cut those programs as well , &quot; said Daniel Mitchell , a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think_tank . However , Mitchell and other conservatives took_issue with the way Reich equated tax_breaks with government spending , saying that there is a fundamental difference between government spending and a government decision not to impose a tax . Reich countered that tax_breaks are comparable_to welfare spending because , when companies get tax_breaks , other companies and individuals must pay more taxes to compensate . House Republicans plan to introduce a bill that would end the entitlement status for food_stamps , Aid to Families With Dependent Children and other programs that assist the poor . It would also permit states to cut cash benefits to all welfare recipients after two years without guaranteeing a job , and deny benefits permanently to children born_out of wedlock to teen-age parents . Immigrants who are not yet citizens would become ineligible for about 60 programs under their proposals .</TEXT>
