   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON TEAM SEEKS ACCESS TO RECORDS OF 4 OFFICERS ; COURT : DETECTIVE MARK FUHRMAN ' S LAWYER CHARACTERIZES DEFENSE AS DESPERATE . EARLY DNA TEST RESULTS ARE IN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In their most aggressive assault yet on the integrity of police_detectives in the O.J. Simpson case , defense_lawyers filed a motion Thursday seeking broad access to the officers ' personnel records and produced a sworn declaration alleging racism on the part of one key investigator . Simpson ' s lawyers requested information that might indicate that any of the four detectives -- Philip L . Vannatter , Tom Lange , Ronald Phillips and Mark Fuhrman -- violated Police_Department policies by lying_in the preparation of search_warrants , concealing evidence or falsifying reports , among other things . Defense_attorneys are eager to get information on all four detectives , but took particular aim at Fuhrman , whom they described as &quot; a dangerous officer with a propensity to create false information against African American defendants. &quot; Fuhrman ' s attorney , Robert H . Tourtelot , vehemently denied that allegation and said the defense ' s attack on his client is &quot; a desperate act by a desperate attorney. &quot; Late Thursday , members of Simpson ' s defense_team received a tentative but guardedly heartening update on the DNA tests being performed by a Maryland lab . The first batch of preliminary results do not tend to implicate Simpson in the slayings , sources close to the investigation said . The same sources cautioned , however , that the results from Cellmark Diagnostics , the lab performing most of the DNA analysis , are not final and that analysis is under way on additional blood samples . One sample that has been tested is a blood spot found on victim Ronald Lyle Goldman ' s shoe , sources said . DNA tests of that sample show it was not Simpson ' s blood , sources said -- an important conclusion for the defense_team , as it would have been difficult to explain Simpson ' s blood there . The lab , however , is performing DNA analyses on a number of samples recovered from Simpson ' s home and car , as well as from the murder scene . The preliminary results do not include findings on most of those samples . Those tests still are being conducted , and more samples recently were sent to a Berkeley lab to be tested there as well . Nevertheless , the preliminary results heartened members of Simpson ' s defense_team . &quot; It looks pretty good , &quot; said one defense source . &quot; It ' s not the last word , but it ' s a good word. &quot; The director of the Cellmark lab declined comment Thursday , as did police and prosecution officials . Buoyed by the preliminary findings , defense_team members said Simpson ' s attorneys may file a motion to force the prosecution to disclose the result . Despite the strong tone of Thursday ' s motion seeking access to police personnel files , attorney Robert L . Shapiro insisted again that race will not be a factor as he defends Simpson against charges that he murdered his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and Goldman . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty . The defense motion and accompanying documents represent the first time that allegations of racism have been raised in official court records in the Simpson case . Included with the defense motion are previously reported transcripts from a 1983 case in which Fuhrman allegedly made racially charged remarks as he sought a stress pension ; documents involving a 1991 lawsuit filed by a lawyer who said testimony in that case indicated that Fuhrman placed a knife at the feet of a wounded suspect , and a new declaration from a woman who said that Fuhrman made racially offensive comments to her in 1985 or 1986 . &quot; During our conversation , Mark Fuhrman stated that he would pull over any vehicle that was occupied by a black_man and a white_woman , &quot; real_estate_agent Kathleen Bell said , describing an encounter with the officer at a Marine Corps recruiting office . In her sworn declaration , taken this week , Bell continued : &quot; I then asked him : ' What if you don ' t have a good reason to pull them over ? ' Mr. Fuhrman then stated : ' I ' d make one up. ' &quot; Bell said she asked Fuhrman if he would do the same thing if the two people were in_love . &quot; Fuhrman then appeared to get disgusted with me and stated , ' If I had my way , they would take all_the niggers , put them together in a big group and burn them. ' I became visibly upset , began to cry and left the office. &quot; According to Tourtelot , Fuhrman denies ever having met the woman whose declaration was submitted and says he never made the comments attributed to him . Efforts to locate Bell were unsuccessful Thursday , and Shapiro would not say how the defense_team became aware of her account . The allegations about Fuhrman are included because they cast doubt on his credibility , Shapiro said . Tourtelot scoffed at that . &quot; He stood_up in court and said in front of the judge and the world that race was not going_to be an issue in this case , &quot; Fuhrman ' s lawyer said . &quot; Then we see this motion . What ' s that they say ? If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it ' s a duck . This is about race. &quot; The motion was drafted by Carl E . Douglas , an associate of Shapiro ' s co-counsel Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . Before he joined the defense_team , Cochran said that race would loom as a major issue if it were linked to Fuhrman ' s credibility . &quot; I think you ' ll see the defense really seek to exploit it , &quot; Cochran said last month . Indeed , the allegations raise potential problems for Fuhrman if prosecutors call him as a witness . If the judge permitted it , he could be cross-examined about his alleged statements as defense_attorneys try to establish that he had a motive to lie or plant evidence in the Simpson case . Fuhrman is the officer who discovered a bloody glove at Simpson ' s estate a_few hours after the slayings . So far , no evidence has surfaced that Fuhrman planted the glove , as some defense sources have suggested . Police , in fact , have concluded after interviewing officers who were at the crime scene on the night of the slayings that it would have been virtually impossible for Fuhrman to remove a glove from the area where the bodies were recovered and take it to Simpson ' s home . Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor , said the allegations of racially charged remarks by Fuhrman might be admissible , at least to cross-examine the detective about his willingness and motive to lie . But Arenella , like other legal_experts , added that the ability to raise those questions might be limited by the kind of defense that Simpson ' s attorneys mount . The defense is seeking five years ' worth of personnel records on the detectives . To get them , defense_attorneys do not need to establish admissibility right away ; they need only demonstrate a good reason to review the files . Legal experts predicted that the defense probably would get some of the records it is seeking , but added that motions such_as the one filed Thursday are frequently made and often yield only a fraction of what is sought . If Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito decides the defense has justified its request , the LAPD records would be turned_over to him . The judge would review them and decide whether anything contained in the documents is relevant to the Simpson case . Pertinent records would be made available to the defense . Legal experts said that if the police records contain information suggesting that Lange or Vannatter have been previously accused of misrepresenting themselves in applying for search_warrants , the defense would almost certainly be entitled to that information . Lange and Vannatter prepared the search_warrant affidavit in the Simpson case , and the motion filed Thursday alleges that the affidavit &quot; contained numerous false_statements , misrepresentations and concealments of material facts. &quot; The motion details what defense_attorneys say were misrepresentations , but does not offer any evidence to suggest that either Lange or Vannatter have had previous complaints leveled against them . Likewise , it makes only scant reference_to Detective Phillips , Fuhrman ' s supervisor . But it levels a blistering attack at Fuhrman . The files from the 1983 pension case have been widely reported . But the other material about Fuhrman contained new details of allegations against him . In the 1991 lawsuit , Joseph J . Britton alleged that he was shot six times by Fuhrman and another officer April 7 , 1987 . Britton ' s lawyer , Robert Deutsch , said testimony during a trial last fall indicated that Fuhrman had picked_up a knife from one location and placed it near Britton ' s feet to justify the officers ' shooting -- a contention similar to that raised by defense sources in the Simpson case . Britton , who said he was unarmed and offering no resistance , alleged that after he was shot and lying on the ground , one of the officers taunted him , saying : &quot; Why don ' t you just die ? &quot; Although the taunting officer was not identified by name in the original complaint , Deutsch said Thursday that the officer was Fuhrman . A substantially different version of the same incident emerges in a report prepared by prosecutors who routinely investigate officer-involved shootings . Those prosecutors found no wrongdoing on the part of the officers . According to the September , 1987 , report , which is based on statements that Fuhrman and Officer J . P . Aiken gave to investigators , Britton and another man were attempting to rob an ATM customer when Fuhrman and Aiken emerged from a stakeout and chased the suspect . The officers found Britton hiding in a nearby shopping_center and together fired 16 rounds at him after he refused to drop a &quot; shiney object &quot; that Aiken thought was a gun , according to the report . A knife nearly 15 inches long was recovered , the report said without indicating where and at what point the knife was found . In explaining why no wrongdoing was found on the part of the officers , Deputy Dist . Atty . Herbert R . Lapin said Britton eventually pleaded guilty to the robbery and a charge of &quot; drawing or exhibiting a weapon in a rude and threatening manner. &quot;</TEXT>
