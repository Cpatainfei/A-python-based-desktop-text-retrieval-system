   <HEADLINE> NANSEN FIELD OWNERSHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The article concerning the Norwegian government ' s property , Nansen Field on the Palos Verdes Peninsula ( June 14 ) , has come_to my attention . There is a lawsuit pending concerning the property . Your article is marred by errors and inaccuracies ; I feel compelled to attempt to correct some of the most egregious ones . The least defensible misstatement is the canard that the Nansen Field property was &quot; donated &quot; ( to whom ? ) by the previous owner , the Palos Verdes Corp . In fact , the Norwegian government , through its agency , the Norwegian Welfare Service for Merchant Seamen , purchased the property in 1948 at what was then fair market_value . Over the years , Norway also improved the property at great expense , creating athletic_facilities and building several clubhouses on the property for the use of Norwegian merchant seamen . Norway ' s adversaries enjoy painting themselves as intrepid &quot; Davids &quot; fighting the Norwegian government ' s &quot; Goliath. &quot; However , what truly characterizes Norway ' s adversaries in this matter is a quite astonishing lack of appreciation for the Norwegian government ' s generosity towards the local Norwegian American community over the years . For many years , Norway has freely allowed individuals , clubs and organizations with Norwegian affiliations to use the Nansen Field property virtually free_of charge , and has required only that they contribute to the maintenance of the property in a manner justified by their own use of the property . Instead of the gratitude , the Norwegian government has instead been confronted with an egregious attempt on the part of Ragnar Amlie and his cohorts , some of whom have enjoyed the free use of Nansen Field for years as a result of Norway ' s generosity , to appropriate for themselves property that has belonged_to Norway for more_than 45 years . Norway purchased the Nansen Field property in 1948 for the very specific purpose of it serving as a recreational area for Norwegian merchant seamen during the time they spent in local harbors . However , due_to the decline in Norwegian shipping on the West Coast of the U.S. and to other changes in the way merchant shipping is conducted ( primarily much shorter layover times ) , the property cannot any longer be used for the purpose for which it was acquired . It would seem to be a matter of elementary fairness to let a property_owner dispose_of the property or put it to some_other use . To the Norwegian government ' s utter amazement , Amlie and his cohorts have a different view of the_matter . ANFIN ULLERN , Consul of Norway , Los Angeles</TEXT>
