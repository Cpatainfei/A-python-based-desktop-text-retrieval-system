   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / JERRY CROWE ; CHANG HAS NOT ABANDONED HIS QUEST FOR ANOTHER MAJOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than five years have passed since Michael Chang won the_French Open in 1989 , becoming the youngest male winner of a Grand_Slam tournament at 17 years 3 months . And although he has won 16 tournaments since , Chang has not seriously challenged for a second Grand_Slam title , advancing as far as the semifinals only once . His career has continued to flourish -- this year alone he has won five tournaments and earned more_than $ 800 # 000 in prize_money -- but Chang said that he will not consider it a complete success if he never again wins one of the sport ' s four major events . &quot; The reason being is that , I feel that at this particular time , I ' m a much better player than I was when I was 17 years old , &quot; said Chang , who is seeded sixth at the U.S. Open , which starts Monday in New York . &quot; Although the game has gotten better , I think that I ' m still able to go_out and compete against the big boys . &quot; What ' s been difficult as far as Grand_Slam events , I ' m able to get_through the early rounds and win a_couple_of big matches , but I haven ' t been able to put_together a string of them . And that ' s what it takes_to win a Grand_Slam event . &quot; You ' ve got_to be able to beat the best , and you ' ve got_to be able to beat three of them in a row , in many cases . And that ' s what ' s been sort of frustrating . I haven ' t been able to do that. &quot; But Chang hasn ' t abandoned his quest . Still six months shy of his 23rd birthday , he is the youngest of the five U.S. players ranked among the top 15 . &quot; I give myself a little more time than say , Pete ( Sampras ) and Jim ( Courier ) , partly because of my size and partly because I ' m younger , &quot; Chang said . &quot; I think people forget that I ' m the youngest one of that little bunch ( that also includes Todd Martin and Andre Agassi ) . &quot; It ' s frustrating getting_to a certain point in an event and losing to Pete in the quarterfinals of the ( U.S. ) Open last year , then running_into him again at Wimbledon ( this year ) . But , then again , to win those events , you ' ve got_to beat the best players in the world. &quot; He knows . He did_it once . * Music Men : In an effort to &quot; improve the presentation and add more fun and entertainment to men ' s professional_tennis , &quot; the ATP Tour introduced several innovations this month at a tournament in New Haven , Conn. , among them playing music selected by the players during their introductions . Ivan Lendl , the tour ' s all-time money leader , chose &quot; Penny Lane , &quot; by the Beatles . Agassi , in a wink_at his former No . 1 fan , picked &quot; The Way We Were , &quot; by Barbra Streisand . A partial list of songs that probably won ' t ever be heard : -- &quot; I ' m a Loser , &quot; by the Beatles . -- &quot; Poor Poor Pitiful Me , &quot; Warren Zevon . -- &quot; Born to Lose , &quot; Ray Charles . * Sour Note : Agassi strongly objected to playing music during changeovers . &quot; To add_to the sport , you need to add_to it , not take people out of the game , &quot; said the originator of &quot; rock ' n ' roll &quot; tennis . &quot; Playing music on the changeovers is taking people out of what they ' re going there for . &quot; Rock ' n ' roll tennis is not playing rock ' n ' roll music during the match . Rock ' n ' roll tennis is an attitude . Rock ' n ' roll tennis is a way of playing and a way of being out there . It ' s saying , ' Come_on , get alive , get_into this. ' Bringing the fans into it is what I try to do on any level . Tennis as a sport deserves to maintain its entertainment value -- as a sport. &quot; * Still more music news : John McEnroe recently took his band to Italy , kicking_off a two-week tour with a concert in Santa Margherita that was described by a local newspaper as &quot; the musical equivalent of a double fault. &quot; Before what was described as an unenthusiastic crowd of 400 , McEnroe led his group , McBand , in covers of Rolling Stones and Nirvana tunes and songs about New York life . McEnroe was not discouraged . &quot; In sports , you can win or lose , &quot; he told an Italian newspaper . &quot; On stage , it ' s different because you can get results somewhere in the middle . I ' m not afraid . This time , I know I ' m not the best. &quot; * Opposing view : Contrary to conventional wisdom , Anne Person Worcester of the Women ' s Tennis Council said that Steffi Graf ' s dominance of the WTA Tour and negative publicity surrounding the sport in the year after Monica Seles ' departure was actually good for women ' s tennis . &quot; Steffi set a new standard and other players have strived to reach that level and have really succeeded in stepping_up the level of_their_own tennis , &quot; Worcester told Elliott Almond of The Times . &quot; Losing Monica and Jennifer ( Capriati ) for a while , some of the negative stories that have been coming_out of women ' s tennis have almost been a blessing in disguise . &quot; I ' ve seen a tremendous stepping_up of the players just in the first six months of this year . Because they said , ' OK , we ' re minus two marquee names , we ' ve got negative news_stories , the economy is tough , we ' re looking_for a sponsor . We ' ve got_to convey how terrific women ' s tennis is. ' And they have done that . &quot; From a little bit of pain comes a lot of gain. &quot; Tennis Notes More_than 350 players from 25 countries will play in the 15th U.S. Open Wheelchair Championships Oct . 8-16 at the Racquet Club of Irvine . . . . The 16th Tracy Austin Pro-Celebrity Tennis Tournament is scheduled Oct . 22 at the West_End Racquet Club in Torrance .</TEXT>
