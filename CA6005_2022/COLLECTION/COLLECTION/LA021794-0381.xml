   <HEADLINE> WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE ' PHILADELPHIA ' STORY ? ; MOVIES : A LAWSUIT ALLEGING THE FILM ' S IDEA IS BASED ON A REAL CASE HAS AROUSED CURIOSITY ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE TRISTAR FEATURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To hear TriStar Pictures tell it , the idea for the Academy Award-nominated screenplay for &quot; Philadelphia &quot; was developed in 1991 , two years after director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ron Nyswaner first began brainstorming a movie about AIDS . But the studio ' s account , disseminated in publicity materials and countless articles about the current film , apparently leaves_out a_few details , including independent producer Scott Rudin ' s ( &quot; The Addams Family &quot; and &quot; The Firm &quot; ) connection with the high-profile project , the first major studio film to address the subject of AIDS . Earlier this month , many people in Hollywood were surprised to learn that Rudin was named -- along with TriStar , Demme , Nyswaner and producer Edward Saxon -- in a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed_in U.S. District Court in New York by the family of the late Geoffrey Bowers , a New York lawyer who fought an AIDS discrimination battle bearing striking similarities to the story told in &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; The movie_stars Tom Hanks , who was also nominated last week for an Oscar , and has grossed $ 50.5 million so far . Speaking on behalf of the studio and the other defendants , TriStar has called the Feb . 1 Bowers suit &quot; completely groundless and absolutely without merit. &quot; No formal answer to the lawsuit has yet been filed . It is a truism in the entertainment_industry that just about every successful movie will spawn at least one lawsuit , and most of these cases do not get very far . Whether or not the Bowers suit , to be tried under New York State contract law and federal trade practices law , turns_out to be an exception , it has already aroused curiosity about the origins of &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; Two knowledgeable sources , who insisted on anonymity , have told The Times that Rudin initiated the project and brought_in Nyswaner but dropped_out when Demme became attached . For some reason , they say , the Oscar-winning director of &quot; The Silence of the Lambs &quot; did not want Rudin on board . Demme almost always collaborates with Saxon , his partner in the Clinica Estetico production company . A former executive at Orion Pictures , where the project was developed before it was acquired by TriStar , confirmed that the movie originated with Rudin . Studio President Marc Platt has declined to discuss the case , nor has the studio permitted the other defendants to comment . ( Although Rudin has a production deal at Paramount , calls to him were returned by TriStar ' s publicity department. ) One participant in the movie , Tom Stoddard , a lawyer with AIDS who used to specialize in HIV discrimination cases , attacked the Bowers family for filing the latest suit . Stoddard served as a consultant on &quot; Philadelphia &quot; and has a cameo role in it . &quot; I view this lawsuit as nothing more_than greed , &quot; Stoddard said . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s any basis for this lawsuit , but even if there were , it is an immoral and irresponsible act to try to punish the folks who made a movie that can only improve the world that mistreated their son. &quot; In court documents , the Bowers family traces &quot; Philadelphia &quot; to 1988 , when Rudin , perhaps after reading about the case in the news media , first approached them and told them he wanted to make a movie based on the young lawyer ' s struggle against his law_firm , the largest in the nation . Rudin attended a session of the Geoffrey Bowers hearing before the New York State Division of Human_Rights , traveled_to Massachusetts to talk with Bowers ' friends and family members , and flew one of Bowers ' attorneys to Los Angeles for further discussion , the family contends . Bowers himself had died the year before at age 33 , shortly after testifying in his employment discrimination case , which took seven years to be resolved . Last December , his estate was awarded $ 500 # 000 by the human_rights division . ( The law_firm , Baker &amp; McKenzie , has said it plans to appeal the order. ) Rudin is not listed in the credits for &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; and TriStar contends he was not involved in the movie . But a source close to Rudin acknowledged to The Times that the producer did meet with Bowers ' survivors and attorneys and had talked to Nyswaner about writing a script based on the Bowers case . Rudin and Nyswaner had collaborated previously on &quot; Mrs . Soffel &quot; ( 1984 ) and on a project called &quot; Pink Boy &quot; that was never made . The Bowers deal fell_through , the Rudin supporter said , when Rudin and the family could not agree on terms . The Bowers family , however , alleges that Rudin struck an oral agreement with them to make a movie of Geoffrey ' s story . Subsequently , they say , he transferred these rights to Orion Pictures , where he had two other projects in development with Platt , who was then executive_vice_president of that studio . TriStar , in turn , acquired the rights in 1991 after Orion declared bankruptcy , according to the suit . By this time Platt had become president of TriStar and continued to oversee the project . Rudin had told staff_members that he planned to turn Geoffrey Bowers ' experiences into a movie . One former employee said Rudin was &quot; very upset &quot; by Demme ' s rebuff . &quot; It made Scott crazy to have Demme not like him , &quot; this source said . Mike Medavoy , Platt ' s boss both at Orion and -- until last month -- at TriStar , said : &quot; I was gone from Orion when that thing was developed . . . . There ' s no question it was a fictional story. &quot; Medavoy resigned from Orion in 1990 . The Bowers family ' s complaint , however , describes a series of events that allegedly occurred in 1992 : Geoffrey Bowers ' attorneys , Robert Balsam and Daniel Felber , learned from news accounts that TriStar was planning to make a movie , with Demme directing , about a lawyer who was dismissed from his job because he had AIDS . At that time , the movie ' s title was &quot; Probable Cause. &quot; When the attorneys asked Rudin about &quot; Probable_Cause , &quot; he referred them to Platt , saying he was no longer involved in the movie . In the course of &quot; several conversations , &quot; Balsam recounted the project ' s history to Platt and requested a copy of the screenplay . &quot; Platt never responded to Mr. Balsam ' s statements , ignored his request for a copy of the screenplay and avoided any further discussions with him , &quot; the complaint states . In publicity materials issued before the movie opened last December , the studio described the origin of &quot; Philadelphia &quot; this way : &quot; ( Director Jonathan ) Demme and ( screenwriter Ron ) Nyswaner first discussed the story idea four years ago . They had each learned that someone close to them was suffering from AIDS . . . . It took two years of Demme and Nyswaner sending articles back and forth , trading books and talking to family and friends to work_out a compelling story. &quot; Entertainment lawyers say the Bowers family ' s case is likely to hinge_on two questions : whether the existence of an implied oral_contract can be proved ; and whether &quot; Philadelphia &quot; contains elements that go beyond what is in the hearing record and are unique to Geoffrey Bowers ' experiences . Material from the testimony could well be deemed in the public_domain -- free to be used without a contract . Unlike California , New York takes a &quot; limited and restrictive &quot; view of implied contract rights with_regard_to creative material , said New York-based entertainment litigator Charles Ortner . &quot; What New York does is essentially look_at the issue of novelty and originality. &quot; &quot; This will be a very difficult case for the plaintiff to prove , &quot; Ortner predicted . &quot; Ultimately , if they don ' t convince the judge or jury that they have an enforceable contract and that their story is unique and original , it ' s going_to be very difficult to get recovery. &quot; Felber said in a telephone_interview that &quot; Philadelphia &quot; mimics the Bowers case in at least 20 instances . Like Andrew Beckett , the lawyer portrayed by Hanks , Bowers was fired by his tony law_firm after he developed Kaposi ' s sarcoma lesions on his face . Both the fictional_character and Bowers attempted to use makeup to disguise the telltale signs of AIDS . In real_life , just as in the movie , Bowers no longer had visible lesions on his face when he testified in his human_rights division hearing , and stunned onlookers when he bared his chest to reveal the disfiguring marks . Bowers , like Beckett , said his law_firm falsely accused him of poor performance in_order to get_rid_of him . These similarities , however , could have been gleaned from the hearing record , Felber acknowledged . But there are other parallels that could have been passed_on only by Bowers ' friends and family , according to Felber . The complaint alleges , for example , that Geoffrey ' s brother Charles confided to Rudin that Geoffrey had expressed concern about how the discrimination case , one of the first of its kind , would affect the family , especially his mother . &quot; My mother would never be ashamed to see one of her kids refuse to sit in the back of the bus , &quot; the complaint quotes Charles as telling his brother . In &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; Beckett ' s mother , portrayed by Joanne Woodward , allays her son ' s worries by using the same analogy . Despite these similarities , Stoddard maintains that another discrimination suit , this one actually filed by a Philadelphia lawyer , could just as easily have served as the basis for &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; The late Clarence Cain successfully sued Hyatt Legal Services Corp. , claiming AIDS discrimination , after he was fired in 1987 . Unlike Bowers and the fictional Beckett , however , Cain ran a regional office of a multistate chain of low-cost legal clinics and was sacked after he informed his employer he had the disease . In addition , Cain came from a very poor family -- he was the first of 10 children to attend college -- and he was black . &quot; I had extensive conversations over a period of a year and a half with the people producing ' Philadelphia , ' and we repeatedly talked_about the issue generically of AIDS discrimination , &quot; Stoddard said . &quot; I brought_to_bear knowledge that I had of the Cain case and implicitly the Bowers case , and a host of other employment cases that I know . Tom Hanks ' story is not the direct reflection of ( any particular case ) . It ' s just not. &quot; But even people who are skeptical of TriStar ' s claim that &quot; Philadelphia &quot; is entirely a work of fiction are troubled by the question of why the family cannot produce a written agreement -- especially because the plaintiffs include Felber and Balsam , law_school classmates of Bowers who represented him in the discrimination case . Felber said he and the Bowers family were preoccupied with their AIDS discrimination fight and the prospect of making_it known to a wider public . &quot; Everyone is so cynical now in these times , &quot; he said . &quot; Someone comes_to you and says , ' Your message should get_out in another forum. ' Are you going_to say , ' I want cash up front ? ' I go ballistic when people say , ' You ' re a lawyer , why didn ' t you get_it in writing ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
