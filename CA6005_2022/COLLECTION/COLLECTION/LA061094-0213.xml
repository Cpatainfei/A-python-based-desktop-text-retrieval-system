   <HEADLINE> 9 PRIESTS AMONG 72 SLAIN IN NEW RWANDA MASSACRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another massacre . The word has come_to symbolize the Rwandan conflict . This time it involves nine Roman_Catholic priests and 63 others killed in the capital . The United Nations said Thursday that it had received reliable reports of a massacre that occurred late Monday or early Tuesday in the Nyamirambo district of the city , a southwestern quarter now the scene of heavy fighting . It was not clear whether rebel or government troops carried_out the slayings . The news came just a day after Rwandan rebel radio reported that 13 other Rwandan clergymen , including the Roman_Catholic archbishop of Kigali and two bishops , were killed by four rebel soldiers assigned to guard them . &quot; We are also very , very concerned by what happened , &quot; said Col . Frank Mugambage , a rebel leader , referring to the incident near Kabgayi , 30 miles west of Kigali . &quot; We are ready to admit it was done_by some of our misguided soldiers. &quot; Mugambage said many of his men were recruited from among families affected by the recent massacres in Rwanda and because many of the mass killings have occurred in churches , some may associate the church with the killings . He said one of the soldiers was shot and killed by other rebel guards and three others fled . Pope John Paul II said he was &quot; profoundly upset &quot; by the Kabgayi massacre , and prayed that the victims find in heaven &quot; the peace that their well-loved land denied them. &quot; The Vatican did not comment on the deaths in Kigali . Up to 500 # 000 people have died since the Rwandan civil_war erupted anew April 6 , following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana , a Hutu , in a mysterious plane crash . The conflict is both political and ethnic , involving historic animosities between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi tribes . Most of the victims of the civil_war have been civilians . Government-trained Hutu militiamen have been responsible_for most of the massacres , often supported by government soldiers .</TEXT>
