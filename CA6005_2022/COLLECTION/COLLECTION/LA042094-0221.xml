   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; HIMALAYAN HUNT FOR HOLY HEIR ; SPURRED BY A CRYPTIC NOTE AND DUELING PROPHECIES , MEMBERS OF A TIBETAN BUDDHIST SECT ARE SPARRING OVER WHICH OF TWO BOYS IS THEIR REINCARNATED LEADER . THERE ARE RUMORS OF FRAUD -- EVEN MURDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mystery is as deep , and perhaps as impenetrable , as the snows of Tibet . Its genesis was a dirty , sweat-stained piece_of_paper hidden for almost a decade . In rune-like handwriting and free_verse , the riddle told believers where to find their reincarnated leader . The place : where the &quot; divine thunder &quot; peals . The birth date : the year of &quot; the one used for the earth. &quot; Identifying characteristics : born to a father named Dondrup and a mother named Lolaga , to the &quot; miraculous , far-reaching sound of the white one. &quot; At the end of that bizarre trail of hints , somewhere in the high , bleak plateaus of eastern Tibet , they would find the holy child . Disagreement over the meaning of such Delphic clues -- along with bickering over whether the note itself is a forgery -- has created an unprecedented split between normally gentle Tibetans whose Karma Kagyu order of Buddhism reveres a high lama who wears a black hat . The purity of the Karma Kagyu , one of the four main subgroups of Tibetan Buddhism , is at_issue . But so , perhaps , is an unholy thirst for money and power . Murder may have been committed . The secret_services of the Chinese government could even be involved , at_work to further suppress the people of Tibet , who have lived under Beijing ' s boot since the People ' s Liberation Army occupied their Himalayan peaks and valleys in 1950 . For the first time in nearly nine centuries , two rival boys have been produced to wear the bejeweled crown of blue-black brocade that distinguishes the leader of the Karma Kagyu order . High-ranking lamas ( monks ) disagree about which child is their reborn master , or karmapa . One , an 8-year-old named Ugyen Trinlay Dorji , is in Tibet . The other , Tenzin Chentse , a 10-year-old , was brought_to New Delhi , a center of Tibetan exile life , and kept under guard in a room filled with chocolates , Wrigley ' s gum , videos of &quot; Alice in Wonderland &quot; and &quot; Tom_and_Jerry &quot; and a big brown teddy_bear . His supporters say he has been moved to a location they will not reveal . To present Ugyen Trinlay Dorji ' s case to the world , his monastic champions rented a ballroom at one of Delhi ' s ritziest hotels early this month for a news_conference and engaged a public relations professional who normally handles clients such_as Coca-Cola . For those monks in their burgundy robes , some of whom have the shaved heads and beefy bodies of professional wrestlers , the villain of the story is the chief promoter of the competing child -- and a reborn traitor from Tibet ' s history . &quot; We believe_in one thing as Buddhists : This is our karma ( fate ) , the karma of everyone involved , &quot; said Tai Situ Rinpoche , who is himself venerated as the 12th incarnation of a distinguished lama . &quot; But karma doesn ' t mean we have to give in. &quot; When three busloads of people pulled_up last month outside a Buddhist temple in New Delhi to harass worshipers at a pomp-filled welcoming ceremony for the rival Tenzin Chentse , stones and bottles flew . Since 1110 , Tibetan Buddhists say , the karmapa has been reborn in an unbroken string . His lineage is a full three centuries older than that even of the Dalai Lama , the spiritual_leader of all Tibetans . The karmapa claims the allegiance of about 20 % of Tibetans , but also of a third to half of the Buddhists in neighboring Nepal , Bhutan and the Indian areas of Sikkim and Ladakh . The Karma Kagyu seat had been at the Tsurphu monastery in Tibet , but after the Communist Chinese occupation , its leaders fled and established their headquarters at Rumtek in Sikkim , which was a princely state before becoming part of India . The order has nearly 200 monasteries in Tibet ( many in ruins ) , plus 30 in India and Nepal and more_than 200 meditation centers worldwide . It claims 100 # 000 foreign followers in Southeast_Asia , Europe and North_America . The succession drama began when the exiled 16th karmapa died of cancer in a small Chicago-area hospital on Nov . 5 , 1981 , at age 58 . Where and how would he reincarnate himself ? The followers waited impatiently . Over the centuries , it had been customary for the karmapas to leave clues_in letters that would lead believers to their rebirth . Had the 16th karmapa done the same ? On March 22 , 1992 , Tai Situ Rinpoche , one of his four regents , presented thrilling proof that he had . A yellow brocade talisman , two inches square , that the karmapa had given him as a gift in a Calcutta hotel 10 months before he died contained the dirty , creased paper bearing the enigmatic clues , Tai Situ announced . Tai Situ says that on presenting the talisman to him , the 16th karmapa said , &quot; It will confer great benefit. &quot; For years , he asserted , he wore the amulet around his neck and on his belt before he finally realized the import of the karmapa ' s words and opened it . Armed with the strange clues , a search_party set_off from India . Linking up with monks from Tsurphu in Tibet , the searchers examined reports of unusual births as well as the claims of reincarnation that proliferate after the death of a karmapa . In May , 1992 , the monks ' travels led them to the village of Bakor in the eastern Tibetan district of Lhatog ( &quot; thunder god &quot; ) . There , a son had been born to a nomadic shepherd named Karma Dondup Tashi and his wife , Loga -- names strikingly similar to those in the written clues -- on June 26 , 1985 , the Tibetan Year of the Wood Ox . Just before the birth , the lamas were told , a beautiful songbird perched on the pole of the tent and burst into melody . Clearly , in light of the written hints of thunder and other details , this was the karmapa . Tai Situ , who had remained in India , dispatched a happy fax to the Dalai Lama , who was traveling . The excited searchers took the boy , Apo Gaga , to the Tsurphu monastery , where several aged monks recognized him as their reincarnated master . Big-eyed and unusually bright , Apo Gaga was so special that he had been invited by another monastery to become a monk at age 4 . The Dalai Lama , who had experienced a vision in which he saw a valley like the one where the child was born , gave his assent , and the red-cheeked boy , renamed Ugyen Trinlay Dorji , was enthroned as 17th karmapa in Tsurphu on Sept . 27 , 1992 . &quot; When the karmapa came_to the window , the crowd went_into an absolute frenzy of veneration , &quot; wrote Brian Golden , a journalist who attended the ceremony . &quot; All hands were immediately pressed together in a gesture of supplication , and the chanting of mantras permeated the air . Hundreds of scarves . . . of white , yellow and orange were thrown_in the direction of the karmapa , covering everything at the front of the monastery. &quot; When the boy waved and threw handfuls of rice , joyful Tibetans dove to the ground to grab a_few of the blessed grains . It seemed wondrous . But was it ? Another regent , Shamar Rinpoche ( rinpoche is a title meaning precious one ) doesn ' t think so . He calls the whole chain of events that began with the letter ' s discovery a sham . To the dismay of Tai Situ and some_other high lamas , Shamar , a nephew of the late karmapa , spearheaded his own search for a successor . He found Tenzin Chentse , born in May , 1983 , in Tibet . At age 3 , this boy is said to have told his surprised parents , &quot; Tsurphu was my monastery , &quot; to have described its golden roof and to have recited an ancient Buddhist scripture as though recalling it from memory . It is he who should rightfully wear the black hat , Shamar maintains . But what of the clues couched in verse ? A fraud , charges 50-year-old Topgya Yulgyal , another nephew of the late karmapa and a cousin of Shamar . &quot; I was with the 16th karmapa since age 11 , &quot; he said . &quot; I knew his handwriting . So the moment I saw this writing ( on Tai Situ ' s paper ) I knew it was a forgery. &quot; To give his camp ' s version of events , Yulgyal , dressed in a Western-style button-down shirt , met an American journalist at the New Delhi temple that was the site of the stone-throwing melee last month . In a droning buzz , monks inside the temple intoned their evening_prayers . The scene was peaceful , a reminder of the blissful calm that leads many Westerners to Buddhism . Yet before entering , visitors were frisked and screened with a metal detector . &quot; I think one reason for this is power , and the other is money , &quot; Yulgyal said when asked why the dispute had broken_out over the Karma Kagyu leadership . &quot; But the main thing here is politics. &quot; Perhaps . The Chinese Communists dealt brutally with Tibetan religion . Before China ' s occupation of the &quot; land of snows , &quot; prayer flags flew from homes and mountaintops , and monasteries flourished . The Chinese closed the temples , destroyed religious artifacts and writings and tore_down the prayer flags . But now , under intense scrutiny for its human_rights practices , China has been trying to project a more tolerant image . Authorities in Beijing have decided that Ugyen Trinlay Dorji -- the boy the Dalai Lama himself recognizes -- is entitled to call himself the 17th karmapa . The officially atheistic press hails him as a &quot; living Buddha. &quot; For Yulgyal , that is evidence of the hand of his homeland ' s oppressors . It is all &quot; dirty politics in the disguise of holy dharma ( law ) , &quot; Shamar summed_up . ( And one American Buddhist who knows the major players remembers Shamar , who has a famously hot temper , reading Machiavelli ' s &quot; The Prince. &quot; ) In the final analysis , there may be no perfectly clean hands in this saga . That is because all four regents , Tai Situ and Shamar included , seem to have willingly colluded in a lie_in 1986 . In February of that year , they announced that a packet containing letters written by the deceased karmapa had been found . Tibetans exulted . &quot; Actually , it doesn ' t exist , &quot; Tai Situ , 39 , now acknowledges , smiling as he peers through his metal-rimmed glasses . The regents , he says , invented the story because they were under pressure by believers to find their reborn leader . Another regent was supposed to lead the search_party that went_to Tibet in 1992 . But a_few days before the scheduled departure , he was killed when a new BMW he was riding in swerved and hit a tree . Some lamas , Tai Situ included , doubt it was an accident , because the engine , he says , was found 150 feet from the car . There was at least one other odd death . The general secretary of Rumtek monastery in Sikkim was invited to lunch by Shamar ' s cousin , Yulgyal , and died mysteriously within minutes of returning home . Yulgyal succeeded the dead man as head of operations and business affairs at the monastery , which he says contains treasures worth &quot; millions. &quot; He was later voted_out . What is especially ironic about the quarrel for the black hat is that its origins lie_in a Tibetan institution that some scholars believe was developed expressly to eliminate rivalries of succession . By transferring authority from one reincarnation to the next , those scholars say , monasteries were able to ensure continuity and prevent their vast holdings from being taken_over or dissipated by rivals . &quot; If a monk has gotten rich and has a well-developed monastery and a treasurer and a manager , the treasurer and manager can certainly keep their jobs if they find a boy to replace the old one , &quot; said Jeffrey Hopkins , director of the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Virginia and author of books on Tibetan Buddhism . In the Tibetan version of an appeal_to the Supreme Court , Tai Situ and his allies called_on the Dalai Lama , a Nobel Peace Prize_winner , to intervene . On March 30 , his secretariat reaffirmed the spiritual credentials of Ugyen Trinlay Dorji , the boy still in Tibet . Given the loose structure of Tibetan Buddhism , and the karmapa ' s possession of a pedigree older than even the Dalai Lama ' s , the latter ' s intervention may_not be enough to settle the issue . And what of karma , the core Buddhist concept that maintains that a person ' s actions determine his fate in the next state of existence ? According to some lamas , the current dispute was foretold centuries ago , and is foreordained . First , Tibetan Buddhists regard Shamar as the reincarnation of a lama who once sided with the king of Nepal to invade and sack their land two centuries ago . The early Shamar was so hated that his red crown was buried in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa , and searching for his reincarnations was forbidden . Only with the current bearer of the title was the lineage finally recognized again . Second , and even stranger , is a prediction written in the 14th Century by the fifth karmapa . &quot; From the north and the east , foreigners will invade , and Tibet will be encircled like a ring , &quot; he wrote . China ' s emperors will be deposed and others will rule_in their place , and &quot; machines made by foreigners will move through the skies. &quot; The fifth karmapa wrote that at the end of the 16th karmapa ' s reign and the beginning of the 17th ' s , a &quot; demonic being will appear , &quot; and &quot; the karmapa ' s doctrine will come_close to destruction. &quot; The evil lama ' s name would be Na-tha , a Sanskrit word that can be translated as protector , relative or nephew . The last translation is not one Shamar Rinpoche or Topgya Yulgyal , nephews of the 16th karmapa , care_for .</TEXT>
