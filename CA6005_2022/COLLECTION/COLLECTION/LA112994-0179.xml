   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S LONG-RULING PRI SCRAMBLES TO PATCH_UP HOLES ; POLITICS : UNDER UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK , IT SEEKS TO CLOSE RANKS WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT ZEDILLO ABOUT TO ASSUME OFFICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With just two days remaining before the most challenging transition of power in recent Mexican history , the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party scrambled to close ranks and present a solid front for President-elect Ernesto Zedillo at a time when his party appears under unprecedented attack from within . Amid reports of death threats against their most potent detractor , top leaders of the party that has governed Mexico for 65 years made a last-minute effort to discredit and isolate Mexico ' s former deputy attorney_general , Mario Ruiz Massieu . He resigned from the party and his post last week after accusing the leaders of covering_up the assassination of his brother , the PRI ' s second-ranking official , who was gunned_down outside a Mexico_City hotel in September . Atty . Gen . Humberto Benitez , who is among those accused by his former deputy of conspiring to cover_up the murder , used his final hours in office to declare in a communique published Monday that Ruiz Massieu ' s investigation found insufficient evidence to charge any PRI officials with wrongdoing . The attorney_general ' s staff also was reviewing possible criminal charges against the former deputy , based on a formal declaration filed Friday by PRI President Ignacio Pichardo . Pichardo , named as a principal in the alleged cover-up , demanded that the attorney_general charge Ruiz Massieu with criminal &quot; defamation and slander &quot; as a result of his allegations , which Pichardo denied as &quot; categorically false. &quot; Maria de los Angeles Moreno , the senator who replaced Ruiz Massieu ' s slain brother , Francisco , as PRI secretary_general , formally demanded similar criminal action Monday against Ruiz Massieu , who stated last week that the evidence showed Moreno should be charged with &quot; various crimes &quot; in the case . &quot; My conscience is clear , &quot; Moreno declared in one of several weekend public appearances . But copies of Ruiz Massieu ' s evidence and his scathing report , now known simply as the &quot; White_Book , &quot; remain in sealed boxes . And the former prosecutor , who reported several death threats against him in the days since he publicly blasted the ruling party and resigned last week , repeated his pledge to present the evidence to Zedillo for action when the president-elect takes the reins of the nation in one of its most difficult hours on Thursday . The controversial report deals with just one of two major , unsolved political murders that will confront Zedillo and a new Cabinet that he must name this week . Taken together , the cases will present an immediate test of Zedillo ' s long-stated platform of judicial and internal reform for a party and a political_system that until recently have ruled with little challenge . In another report issued Friday , the chief prosecutor investigating the assassination last March of the PRI ' s chosen presidential successor , Luis Donaldo Colosio , said she had yet to solve the crime after an intensive effort . The convicted gunman , Mario Aburto Martinez , was sentenced to 42 years in prison last month , but prosecutor Olga Islas de Gonzalez identified at least 10 &quot; lines of investigation &quot; that should be pursued by the next administration . Most analysts said the president-elect is faced with one of the most turbulent transitions in recent memory . Zedillo has vowed to pursue both investigations aggressively after he takes_office , but he has not commented on the substance of either case or identified the next attorney_general , who will be responsible_for continuing the probes . In one of his most dramatic public appearances Monday , the 42-year-old president-elect focused not on his ruling party but on the opposition . Zedillo met for the first time with leaders of the populist Democratic Revolutionary Party , which was shunned by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari throughout his six-year term . The meeting was a clear effort by Zedillo to build consensus and effect political reconciliation . Zedillo defeated two popular challengers with a record-low 50.1 % of the vote_in a hard-fought presidential election in August . But , as a foreshadowing of what most analysts say lies ahead for Zedillo , Mexico ' s respected weekly newsmagazine Proceso hit the streets Monday with photographs of Zedillo ' s face and the back of Salinas ' head on the cover . Below them were the words &quot; Tragic Inheritance. &quot; More on Mexico : For a profile of President-elect Ernesto Zedillo , who assumes power Thursday , and background on the national election last August , see the Special Report in the Nation / World section of the new TimesLink on-line service .
