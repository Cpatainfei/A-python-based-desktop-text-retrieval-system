   <TEXT> She ' s an unemployed , unwed mother at 17 , but Dawn Kowalski feels blessed when she cradles baby Justin -- a warm bundle of tomorrow dozing in her arms . Before the baby came_along , Dawn had no future to hold onto . Stroking his fine , sandy hair , she describes her former self : a school dropout from a troubled home , with no job and no plans , feeling trapped in rural West_Virginia . She wasted her days at the mall , partied all night . &quot; I didn ' t care what happened to me , &quot; she said softly . Now her world is a small apartment dotted with diapers and parenting magazines , the rent paid by a federal housing subsidy . She lives alone with 10-week-old Justin , nursing him , sleeping when he sleeps , listening to country_music because MTV makes him wail . Dawn may be an accidental mother , but she takes_pride in being a good one . &quot; This has made me a better person , &quot; she said recently . &quot; It ' s really straightened my life out. &quot; It ' s an odd perspective . After all , teen-age pregnancy is an avoidable hardship that robs many girls of their prospects and can doom their children to poverty . But life unfolds haphazardly for girls like Dawn , and cause and effect aren ' t always clear . Some believe making a baby is making a future . And to them , even a shaky future may seem better than none at all . * More_than 1 million teen-agers will get pregnant this year ; about a third of them will be age 17 or younger . Teen-agers will give_birth to a half-million babies -- 70 % born_out of wedlock . Compared with other teen-age girls , teen mothers are less likely to finish their education , less likely to earn a decent wage , and more likely to spend years on welfare . Families headed by current or former teen mothers receive $ 34 billion a year in government health and welfare benefits . Americans worried as the teen pregnancy rate climbed over the past two decades , reflecting an increase in the number of teens having_sex . It could be worse , however . Teens who have_sex today use birth_control more effectively than sexually active teens of the past . Abortion also has kept the teen birth_rate down : more_than a third of pregnant teens decide to abort . Middle-class teens have become so successful at avoiding birth that teen mothers are now widely perceived to be poor , black girls living_in the inner_cities . But many rural_areas also have high teen birth_rates , and there are more_than twice as_many white teen-age mothers as black ones . The common_denominator is disadvantage : 83 % of teens who have babies are from poor or low-income families , according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute , a not-for-profit research group . These girls are only slightly more likely than middle-class teens to have_sex . They are significantly more likely to get pregnant , however , and much less likely to have an abortion , Guttmacher found . Births to single mothers are rising across society , but illegitimate babies are still more common among poor girls . Giving_up a child for adoption is rare . Poverty overlaps with all sorts of other factors : black and Hispanic girls get pregnant at twice the rate of whites ; studies show girls raised by a single parent are more likely to have babies ; so are the daughters of teen mothers ; girls who have been sexually abused ; girls who are doing poorly in school or have dropped_out ; and girls who drink or use drugs . Many teen-agers don ' t see a baby as their biggest handicap . * As a child , Dawn made A ' s in school and dreamed of being a lawyer . A favorite fifth-grade teacher joked that her &quot; big mouth &quot; would make her a good one . Dawn and her stepsister practiced arguing cases for fun . But life at_home was chaotic . Dawn ' s parents were always fighting ; money was always short . Her father drank heavily and was often out_of_work . Dawn ' s mother says he beat her and hit the two girls . Whenever he grew too abusive , &quot; Mom would just pack us off to the women ' s shelter , &quot; said Dawn ' s stepsister , Tina Fleming , now 20 . &quot; We lived_in the shelter off and on. &quot; Things got_worse when Dawn ' s parents separated , then divorced when she was 11 . For years Dawn was bounced_back and forth between her father , whom she feared , and her mother , who was often broke and soon in another turbulent marriage . &quot; My life fell_apart , &quot; Dawn said . &quot; I just gave_up . I didn ' t bother with school anymore . I quit caring. &quot; Fleming moved_in with a girlfriend and finished high_school . Dawn could have graduated , too , Fleming says , but she had changed . By then Dawn was routinely skipping school , staying out late , drinking at parties . She tried sex for the first time at age 15 , Dawn said , because &quot; everybody was talking_about it. &quot; Soon after she turned 16 , Dawn quit school . A few months later , she was pregnant . * Teen mothers have become a favorite target of welfare reformers in both political_parties -- they say the current system rewards teens for having illegitimate babies . Girls like Dawn get welfare checks and other aid that lets them set_up their own households and feel_like instant adults , even if they are barely scraping_by . Next year , Congress will consider proposals to cut_off aid to young mothers or make them work for their welfare checks . University of Pennsylvania sociology Professor Elijah Anderson , who studies life in the inner_city , confirms that some girls intentionally get pregnant for &quot; the check. &quot; But they aren ' t the majority of teen mothers he knows . More often , he said , girls who grow_up surrounded by crime and drugs and single moms and out-of-work dads -- girls who dream of marriage and a career but don ' t realistically expect them -- seem to stumble into pregnancy . Some boys reared in this culture make a sport of getting girls pregnant to prove their manhood , Anderson wrote in his book , &quot; Street Wise. &quot; &quot; So many of the young people lack a sense of future , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; I think that plays into this willingness to engage in sex and to be careless about sexual behavior , to not think_about it so much. &quot; The girls don ' t plan a life on welfare ; they don ' t plan much of anything . But a baby has a dreamy sort of appeal . It ' s a familiar story at the Shenandoah Maternity Center , where Dawn and other girls from West_Virginia ' s eastern panhandle , most of them white and low-income , come for care . Some girls are dismayed to be pregnant . The staff suspects others planned it to have something to love or in hopes of holding onto a boyfriend . &quot; But the largest group is those who are just ambivalent -- who didn ' t plan it , but don ' t mind that they are pregnant , &quot; said center director Cindy Barr . &quot; And they are the ones no one seems to talk about. &quot; Neither sermons on abstinence nor lessons in birth_control have gotten_through to this group . * Dawn learned in school about preventing pregnancy and AIDS . She believed_in using condoms . But for a time , shortly after she turned 16 , Dawn tried to get pregnant . She and her steady boyfriend , David , a 24-year-old who already has a child by another woman , had unprotected sex for two months . &quot; We had everything planned out , we were going_to get_married , have a family , &quot; she said . But when she thought she might be pregnant , they got scared . They split_up soon after the false alarm . It was the next man she dated , a relationship that lasted just three months , who fathered her child . They didn ' t bother with birth_control . Dawn insists she didn ' t want to get pregnant , and says she suspected she was infertile . &quot; I thought , that ' s not going_to happen to me , &quot; Dawn said . &quot; And then it happened a month later. &quot; By the time she tested positive , Dawn had already broken_up with the baby ' s father , a 25-year-old electronics store manager . He pressed for an abortion , but she refused . She never considered adoption . Dawn wanted the baby . &quot; At first I was scared , but when I sat_down and thought_about it , it was wonderful , &quot; she said , a smile lighting_up her brown eyes . &quot; I was excited. &quot; * Sex education is based largely on the notion that teens won ' t have babies if they know where to get contraceptives and how to use them . After all , several surveys have found more_than 90 % of unmarried , pregnant teen-agers say they didn ' t want to get pregnant . Yet teens who know about birth_control keep having babies . And sometimes a second or third . To explore this contradiction , Laurie S . Zabin , a Johns Hopkins University professor of population issues , led a survey of 313 black teen-agers who came_to an inner_city Baltimore clinic for pregnancy tests . When asked whether they wanted to be pregnant , 91 % said no . But in answer to other questions -- How would you feel if you were pregnant ? Would having a baby now be a problem for you ? -- about half of them expressed ambivalence about having a baby . At the end of two years , the ambivalent girls were just as likely to have a baby as the handful of girls who said they wanted to get pregnant . Two-thirds of each group gave_birth . The girls who unequivocally wanted to avoid pregnancy did better : just over one-third of them had a baby . If teens had to take a pill every day or use condoms faithfully to get pregnant , Zabin suggests , few would do so . But for sexually active teens ( about half of all girls ages 15 to 19 ) , avoiding pregnancy takes planning and , therefore , motivation . For many girls , especially among the middle_class , the motivation is the promise of an education , a career and marriage -- things worth waiting for . Family , church , friends and teachers help reinforce these goals . &quot; that ' s what brings young people to family_planning services , &quot; said Barbara Huberman , who leads North Carolina ' s efforts to curtail teen pregnancy . &quot; They have a reason : I don ' t want to be a parent , I ' m going_to college , I want to get_out of this little town , I want to go somewhere. &quot; Those who expect less from life see less harm in getting pregnant . In fact , a baby sometimes inspires these girls to improve their lot , often with the aid of programs designed to help teen mothers finish high_school , get job training or go_to college . But many will never build a stable home for their children . Across the country , a_few community programs are trying to motivate poor girls -- and teen-age boys -- before they become parents . Most take a whole-life approach that emphasizes education and career goals and discourages drinking , drugs and premarital sex ( while promoting birth_control for the sexually active ) . But even those who run such teen centers say there is no cure for the cycle of entrenched poverty and broken families that produces aimless teens . &quot; All the money you can spend is just a Band-Aid , &quot; said Imogene Peterson , family services director of The Family Place in Baltimore . &quot; Jobs and futures are what our young people need. &quot; * Six weeks after her baby was born , Dawn returned to the maternity clinic for one of the more foolproof birth_control methods -- Depo-Provera , a contraceptive injection that lasts three months . She is dating David again , and hopes they will be married next summer . She also is studying for the high_school equivalency test and plans to enter a computer training_program , so she can support Justin alone if she has to . &quot; I want to be somebody for him , &quot; Dawn said as her baby slept beside her on the sofa .</TEXT>
