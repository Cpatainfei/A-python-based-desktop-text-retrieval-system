   <HEADLINE> CUTTING-EDGE SWAT FORCE ADAPTS TO CHANGING LAPD ; POLICE : NEGOTIATIONS REPLACE DEADLY FORCE WHEN POSSIBLE , AS TEAM HANDLES RECORD NUMBER OF STANDOFFS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 67 men of the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Special Weapons and Tactics unit are members of the department ' s most exclusive club . Handpicked for the duty after passing rigorous entrance requirements , they train using live ammunition and confront armed and barricaded suspects at the rate of more_than one a week . For a quarter-century , SWAT has occupied a unique place in the Police_Department and the public imagination -- a group of virtual soldiers embedded in a police agency , their missions among the most demanding in law_enforcement . The original SWAT team was pioneered by the LAPD , and it has grown_up there , evolving from a ragtag group of eager volunteers into a tightly disciplined cadre of professionals whose officers train side_by_side with Navy SEALS and Green_Berets . Insular and intensely proud , SWAT was battered and shaped by early criticism and a pair of nationally renowned shootouts , one of which occurred 20 years ago this month . It battled a reputation for militarism , redoubled its emphasis on negotiation and emerged as one of the nation ' s most widely emulated hostage rescue organizations . Most recently , when a highly regarded female officer was denied entry into the unit , it raised the question of when , if ever , SWAT will open its doors to women ; her case is in court and its outcome could again reshape SWAT as it continues to define its place within the LAPD . As SWAT has changed , so has the Police_Department , which is trying to adopt a more community-oriented style that bears little resemblance to the work SWAT officers perform . That leaves SWAT at a telling juncture in its history , caught between the LAPD that gave_birth to it and the one that houses it today . But the paramilitary arm of the Police_Department remains fully staffed and in robust health -- despite the vogue for a kinder , gentler force , despite money problems in municipal_government , despite the departure of its godfather and founder , former Chief Daryl F . Gates . His successor , Willie L . Williams -- a police_chief better known for his devotion to community policing than his belief in special weapons and tactics -- has expressed his confidence in the unit . More important , he has kept it at full strength despite cutbacks in other areas of the Police_Department and pressure to put more officers on patrol . This summer , SWAT will stand_guard against terrorism during the World Cup games , the same function it performed a decade ago during the Summer Olympics . Less trumpeted are the missions its officers perform every day . For no matter how thoroughly the LAPD transforms itself , there are times when only SWAT will do . * On patrol in a tough stretch of Newton Division on a recent Saturday , a_couple_of police_officers run_across a glassy-eyed young_man toting a 9-millimeter pistol and ranting incoherently . When he refuses to drop the gun and instead holes_up in his house , the patrol officers surround the place and call_for SWAT . &quot; We ' re going to scout it , contain it , try to bullhorn it and see if we get a response , &quot; says Sgt . Charles J . Duke , a burly SWAT supervisor who has broken_off dinner with his wife to take_charge of this situation . &quot; If we don ' t , we ' ll tear-gas it . And if that doesn ' t get him out , we ' ll go_in after him. &quot; Moving with the precision of a military_drill team , most of the SWAT officers check their weapons while a small group peels_off to scout out the location . The scouting team returns with good news : There are no hostages visible in the house , and no toys , bicycles or anything to suggest that there may be children in danger . Repeated attempts to bullhorn the man to the door fail . At 9:46 p.m. , the officers fire off the tear_gas . One whiff of it is enough to knock most people to their knees , but this suspect stays in the chair , oblivious to the acrid smoke billowing around him . After several more rounds are fired , he begins to pace and yell -- what sounds like gibberish in a Jamaican accent -- but he still will not come_out . Finally , however , the gas seems to get the upper_hand . At 10:21 p.m. , four hours and a dozen tear-gas canisters later , the man appears on his front_porch . He ' s unarmed and does not resist . The officers put him in plastic handcuffs and load him into a police_car . Neighbors , some of whom have been behind the police tape for hours , straggle home . A few residents jeer at the LAPD , a familiar foe . Others applaud as the officers pack up . &quot; It ' s kind of scary , &quot; says Vena Simpson , as she loads her sleeping baby out of the car and prepares to put her to bed . &quot; These guys are like the Army or something . But I thank the Lord that we have them . That man could have hurt my children. &quot; * The 1965 Watts riots made a deep impression on the city and its police -- and no one reacted more strongly than a young commander named Daryl Gates . Convinced that the riots proved the need for the LAPD to better counteract sniper fire , Gates pioneered SWAT , making the LAPD the nation ' s first police_department to develop such an organization . In the early years , SWAT was informal . Officers continued to work their regular jobs , they got no bonus pay , and they kept a decidedly low profile . &quot; We would send_out these Teletypes to tell guys we had a training day coming_up , and it used to end with , ' Bring your lunch , ' &quot; said Pat McKinley , now the chief of police in Fullerton . &quot; That meant bring your rifle. &quot; The Marine Corps provided some training , and McKinley recalls spending hour after hour marching through the storm drains of Los Angeles , practicing ways to move through the city undetected . &quot; The idea was that if we lost a part of the city , we could come at it through the storm drains. &quot; The officers who staffed SWAT in the early years -- veterans now refer to the team during that period as &quot; Old SWAT &quot; -- were dedicated to the mission but sometimes ill-equipped to carry it out . And on Dec . 8 , 1969 , Old SWAT came face to face with the Black Panthers . When the officers arrived_at a Central Avenue stronghold to serve arrest and search_warrants , they were greeted with shotgun blasts and submachine-gun fire . Over the next five hours , more_than 200 Los Angeles police_officers and a handful of Black Panthers exchanged thousands of rounds of gunfire . When it was over , three officers and six Black Panthers were hurt . Although no one died , the Black Panther shootout raised deep concerns . To do its job correctly , LAPD leaders decided , SWAT needed to be a formal unit whose officers trained and worked together full time . In 1971 , Old SWAT became New SWAT , a full-fledged unit under the wing of the department ' s Metropolitan Division . Then , on May 17 , 1974 , the LAPD engaged in the most notorious gunfight in the history of the organization . That afternoon , police_officers and FBI_agents descended on a 54th Street home where they expected to find members of the Symbionese Liberation Army , the group that had kidnaped heiress Patricia Hearst a_few months before . Three SWAT squads and hundreds of other officers closed_in on the residence , surrounding it . The SLA members did not respond to the bullhorn , but when SWAT fired a single tear-gas canister inside , the residents opened_fire with machine_guns . For about two hours , police and suspects traded shots while news crews broadcast the shootout nationwide . Eventually , the house burned to the ground . Six SLA members died , three from gunshots , three from the fire . As the Panther battle had in 1969 , this major shootout forced the LAPD once again to review the way its SWAT officers went_about their work . &quot; When I took_over Metro ( a_few months after the SLA incident ) , there was a lot of sensitivity about SWAT , &quot; said Jesse A . Brewer , who went_on to become an assistant chief and then president of the Police Commission . &quot; There was a feeling that we were using military tactics against citizens. &quot; Brewer tightened SWAT ' s admission standards , clamped_down on discipline and insisted that SWAT officers treat members of the community with respect . Under him , the unit replaced its old tear-gas canisters , which were implicated in starting the fire that destroyed the SLA headquarters . All of that helped calm the waters , but the evolution of SWAT reflects a constant balancing between the unit ' s use of military tactics and the department ' s desire to project a friendly public image . In the mid-1980s , that tension flared_up again when SWAT began using a pair of battering ram-equipped small tanks , known as V-100s , in some confrontations . &quot; That sent a terrible signal , &quot; said Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , a prominent Los Angeles attorney and frequent police critic . &quot; It reinforced that whole argument about the LAPD as an occupying army. &quot; Without ever admitting a mistake , the LAPD scaled back the use of the tanks . Today , they sit mostly idle , and criticism of the unit is mostly muted . Cochran and Stephen Yagman , two of the city ' s most prominent civil_rights lawyers , say they have not handled any SWAT cases in years . Cochran says his impression is that the unit has improved from its rougher origins . In large measure that is because negotiations or other , less subtle , forms of persuasion resolve almost all SWAT situations without gunshots . Still , there are times when SWAT officers make the hardest of all decisions in police work : When its officers believe they have exhausted all other remedies and feel lives are in danger , SWAT will shoot to kill . * Everything seems to go_wrong at once for Tan Khuat . He and his wife are fighting , he has troubles at_work , and neither the cocaine he has spent all night smoking nor the beers he ' s downing are making things any better . On the morning of Oct . 20 , 1992 , Khuat sets_out to end it all . He storms into his wife ' s apartment , fires several shots and grabs his 3-year-old daughter . Over the next several hours , Khuat shoots at police_officers and reporters and dares police to take action as he threatens again and again to murder &quot; the baby. &quot; He never mentions her name . &quot; I want to get this thing over quick , give you something exciting , &quot; Khuat tells the SWAT team negotiator . &quot; I want her and me together , her heart against my heart . that ' s what it is right now , my baby , my blood . . . . Our hearts beat together right now. &quot; About 1 p.m. , SWAT officers conclude that Khuat is going_to kill his daughter if someone doesn ' t kill him first . They recommend shooting him at the first opportunity . Cmdr . David J . Gascon , head of the LAPD ' s Metropolitan Division , gives his go-ahead . The area captain approves it . Police_officers deliver some food that Khuat has requested while a sniper posted on the roof of an adjacent building takes_aim . At first , everything goes according to plan . Khuat opens the door and steps over the threshold . But just as Officer Charles Buttitta squeezes the trigger , Khuat looks down and to the right , at the food . The bullet misses the center of his head and pierces his left ear . Khuat shrieks that he ' s been hit and dives back into the apartment . He has the little_girl . Khuat runs to the back of the apartment , but SWAT officers storm in behind him . They find him in a bathtub , where he ' s holding the girl in front of his face and screaming : &quot; I kill baby ! I kill baby ! &quot; They beg him to pause for a moment , pleading with him to put the girl down . Khuat hesitates and peers around his daughter , exposing his right eye as he shifts the little_girl ' s body . From seven feet away , SWAT Officer Joe Cordova fires one_shot . His bullet is_on target , striking Khuat just beneath the eye , killing him instantly . As the bullet strikes , Khuat loses his grip on the baby . An officer reaches_out and grabs her before she hits the floor . * If SWAT was born in the aftermath of the Watts riots , it came_of_age in the buildup for the 1984 Summer Olympics . Confident as ever , Gates announced that SWAT would handle any outbreak of terrorism inside the city_limits . Lt . Jeff Rogers , who headed the unit at the time , remembers being pleased at his chief ' s confidence , but a little surprised as well . &quot; I said , ' Gee , that ' s flattering , ' &quot; recalled Rogers , who retired in 1991 . &quot; ' But guess what , chief ? We ' re a SWAT team , not a counterterrorism team. ' &quot; So Gates authorized SWAT to become the organization he had advertised it to be . He sent three of his most trusted officers -- Rogers , Sgt . Al Preciado and Capt . John Higgins -- to Europe , where they studied counterterrorism units in Israel , Italy , France , West Germany , West_Berlin and England . &quot; We came_back with a whole head full of ideas and a shopping list of what we needed , &quot; Rogers said . They got_it . Some new equipment was purchased by the Olympic Organizing Committee . Other pieces -- special poles with mirrors that allow officers to look_around corners without being seen , flashlights that attach_to the barrels of rifles -- were invented by officers in the Metro armory . SWAT also revolutionized its training . Before the 1984 Olympics , SWAT trained with blanks . Today , SWAT , unlike any other unit in the LAPD , trains using live ammunition . They use abandoned buildings to simulate hostage rescue missions , shooting dummies while trying to avoid the cross-fire of their colleagues . Just to make_it more realistic , those drills sometimes include smoke-filled rooms , tear_gas , dim lighting and concussion grenades -- extremely loud devices used to disorient suspects when officers break_into a room . When they are out_to impress a guest , SWAT will sit the visitor in a chair with dummies of hostage-takers on either side . The cops will storm the building , throw the grenades and shoot the dummies while the guest sits frozen to the chair a_few feet from the flying bullets . SWAT officers spend 240 hours a year shooting , climbing , rappelling and practicing other tactics . They fire out of helicopters , rappel off the sides of some buildings and scale the walls of others . They drop from helicopters onto rooftops . It is grueling , dangerous work , but it underscores a message : Things sometimes go_wrong ; SWAT needs to be ready when they do . &quot; You perform like you practice , &quot; one SWAT cop said . &quot; For real. &quot; * Judith Hering , a young medical_assistant , is early for work one summer day in 1983 . She opens the doors to an exam room and finds James Hugh Bomar inside . Bomar is carrying a gun , and he wants money and drugs . Hering is convinced he will kill her and a second hostage if he doesn ' t get his way . As other employees show_up for work , they realize something is wrong inside . They call the police . SWAT responds , and a negotiator strikes_up a conversation with Bomar over the phone . SWAT holds its ground all day , the officers nervously counting_on Bomar to keep talking and not start killing . Meanwhile , they craft a plan to resolve the situation if Bomar refuses to surrender . When he comes_out to get the car he has demanded , a sniper across the parking_lot will shoot him . What they do not know is that Bomar has a plan of_his_own . He has dressed himself and his hostages in hospital gowns and surgical masks . And just before they bolt from the building to the waiting car , he fires off two fire_extinguishers , producing a thick cloud that makes_it impossible for the sniper to get a clear view of who ' s who . SWAT ' s carefully laid plan is useless . So the officers shift gears . Bomar and his hostages pile into the vehicle , with Hering behind the wheel . As she attempts to pull_away , a SWAT cop hits a remote switch , killing the engine . The car stops , and Bomar , who ' s been hiding his head below the seat , pops_up to try to restart the engine . He is holding a gun . Without hesitation , a SWAT officer kneeling beside the car fires into the back of Bomar ' s head . As Bomar dies , he slumps onto Hering ' s shoulder . Sometimes hostages feel affinity for their captors -- not this time . &quot; I was relieved and happy that they had shot and killed him , &quot; Hering said . &quot; I thought : ' Oh , thank goodness . It ' s over. ' &quot; * Today ' s SWAT is a far different unit than the one that ran_into the Black Panthers in 1969 or the SLA in 1974 . It is busier , better trained and better equipped . As a result , according to its officers , it is_better able to resolve the growing number of standoffs that it is called to handle without resorting_to deadly force . In 1993 , SWAT confronted a record 67 barricaded suspects , almost all armed , some holding hostages . SWAT also served 60 high-risk warrants , those in which officers had strong indications that violence might greet them at the door . And yet , SWAT officers did not fire a shot last year . They have had two shootings in 1994 , ending an 18-month stretch in which they did not resort_to deadly force . Hollywood , of course , has tended to portray SWAT as a killing machine , an image that officers dispute even as they sometimes cultivate it . Their calling cards picture three heavily armed cops in full paramilitary regalia , but one veteran SWAT officer says he is_sick of seeing himself portrayed by Hollywood as a &quot; paramilitary , beady-eyed killer. &quot; Over the years , SWAT has toned_down some of its military rhetoric : It still defines its operations as &quot; missions , &quot; but no longer describes breaking_into a house to save a hostage as an &quot; assault. &quot; In today ' s image-conscious LAPD , the preferred term is &quot; rescue. &quot; &quot; We are a lifesaving organization , &quot; said Sgt . Mike Albanese , a veteran SWAT supervisor and experienced negotiator . &quot; Our mission is the absolute preservation of human life. &quot; Others echo that sentiment and emphasize that SWAT talks more_than it shoots ; negotiations or less-than-lethal force solve nearly every SWAT scenario . The team makes a dramatic entrance . They arrive_at a standoff dressed in bulletproof_vests and helmets , radios and guns slung across their backs , their faces sometimes obscured by gas masks . As they huddle around their forbidding , jet-black equipment truck , just about everybody smokes or chews tobacco . A crowd invariably gathers . At one recent incident , the residents pulled_up beach_chairs and binoculars to watch the SWAT crews in action . Others opened their doors to the SWAT officers , inviting them to take_up position on their rooftops and in their carports . &quot; It made us feel better to have them here , &quot; said Adela Saldana , an elderly woman in a wheelchair whose home is a_few doors from the scene of a recent SWAT call-out . &quot; I was afraid . I cannot walk , and this man was out there. &quot; The officers trade off-color jokes and bash liberals while they wait for their full contingent to arrive . But once everyone ' s in place , the banter quickly stops . They may have nicknames like &quot; Freaker , &quot; but they are chillingly serious about their work . It is , after all , serious business . SWAT sometimes kills people . And though it has generally avoided the excessive-force complaints that have devastated other parts of the LAPD , there have been some . In 1988 , SWAT officers shot and killed Ruben Medrano , a 38-year-old Vietnam veteran who had taken an overdose of heroin and was threatening to shoot himself . In an effort to end the standoff , SWAT officers burst into Medrano ' s apartment . What happened next remains a hotly contested legal issue , but Medrano ended_up being shot twice in the chest and once between the eyes . Medrano ' s family charged that SWAT had been too quick to pressure him and had effectively murdered a disturbed man in need of counseling , not confrontation . Although not commenting on that case in particular , SWAT officers insist that they do not rush standoffs . The average incident takes around four hours to resolve , and some last 10 or 12 hours , even longer . In general , negotiators try to keep a suspect talking as long as there seems to be some hope of progress and as long as the hostages do not appear to be in imminent danger . Ask any SWAT cop today about the unit ' s record , and he will cite the group ' s proudest statistic : In 23 years of service , SWAT has never lost a hostage as a result of its actions . Experts say that is the result of SWAT ' s practice of combining negotiation and weaponry under one command -- an approach that is intended to diminish any sense of competition between shooters and negotiators . At the end of a good SWAT day , the hostages go free , the officers go_home and the suspect goes_to jail . * &quot; The ( high-rise ) caper , now that was a slick deal , &quot; recalls retired Lt . Rogers , who served a record 13 years as head of the unit . It ' s about 10:30 a.m. on May 4 , 1988 . Reynard Jones of Compton strides into a Westside high-rise . Jones grabs a temp filling_in for the day and forces her into a conference_room . He claims to have a bomb . He threatens to detonate it if his demands are not met . Jones wants a car , and he wants $ 5 # 000 cash . That poses both tactical and practical problems for the SWAT officers : They do not generally let suspects leave a scene because it threatens to strip them of control over the situation . Plus , none of them have any money . One SWAT officer goes_into a bank and asks whether the folks there would lend the LAPD $ 5 # 000 so that it could pass it on to a hostage-taker who has already threatened to blow himself -- and , presumably , any cash that ' s given to him -- to kingdom come . The bank declines , so the officer pulls_out his credit_card and gets a cash_advance for $ 5 # 000 . He then retires to a corner to chain-smoke and hope that his colleagues can resolve the situation without bankrupting him . Sgt . Albanese spends the better part of the day on the phone with Jones , talking through one issue at a time . Once he gets his money , Jones focuses_on food and a car . He is desperately afraid of getting shot -- at one point , he offers $ 100 to every police_officer at the scene if they will promise not to shoot him on the way to the car . As it begins to get dark outside , police deliver the car . Jones wants to see that it ' s put_in place correctly , so Albanese suggests that the hostage walk over to the window of the high-rise and direct it to just the right place while Jones relays instructions over the phone . While they ' re in mid-sentence , SWAT officers detonate an explosive_device on the door to the conference_room . It blasts the door from its hinges and SWAT cops pour in through the opening . They grab Jones . He has arrested unhurt , and later goes_to prison . The hostage goes free . &quot; They were very good , &quot; said one person who was in the office that day and saw SWAT at_work . &quot; They canvassed the suite , they had a medical backup , they communicated with this guy . They resolved that situation when it looked very , very bad. &quot; LOS ANGELES P</TEXT>
