   <HEADLINE> A WINDING PATH LED TO HUFFINGTON ' S SENATE BID ; ELECTION : MULTIMILLIONAIRE SAYS HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS ARE DRIVEN BY A SPIRITUAL CALLING . BUT SOME SEE A PARADOX .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his quest to reach_out to others , to leave his mark on the world , Michael Huffington has thought_about being many things . The first-term congressman has thought_about being a clergyman , a teacher and a filmmaker . During his youth , he experienced the discipline of military life in a private academy . In a restless career mostly in the oil and gas business , he also dabbled_in the stock_market , real_estate and banking . He briefly held a high-level job in the Defense_Department . But after contemplating his life ' s path in a Greek monastery last year , the multimillionaire from Montecito believes he has found his true calling : He wants to be a U.S. senator from California . &quot; I am not a good writer , &quot; Huffington said in an interview with The Times . &quot; I am not a radio-TV personality . I ' m not an actor . I ' m not a priest . I ' m not a teacher . But hopefully , I ' m a political leader. &quot; Though he has settled_on his immediate goal , the restlessness is still there . A few minutes later he was asked whether he had considered the presidency . Huffington said : &quot; If I could be President , obviously , then I would like to be President . But I would rather be a U.S. senator than almost anything. &quot; At 46 , Huffington seemingly has come_out of nowhere to be regarded_as the Republican front-runner for the seat held by Democratic Sen . Dianne Feinstein . He is the least known major candidate for office this year in California , taken very seriously because of his personal fortune -- estimated at $ 70 million -- and his willingness to spend it on politics . Californians know little about him because most of his career has been spent working in a privately held family company in Texas . He moved to California to run_for office only three years ago . Why California ? &quot; Firstly , I love beauty , &quot; said Huffington , who attended Stanford_University . &quot; This is one of the most beautiful states in the country . I love the weather . that ' s the biggest reason , obviously. &quot; Because he is so little-known statewide , Huffington has been spending millions of_his_own money on television ads to introduce himself to voters . Huffington is a very private man and there is an awkwardness as he presents himself publicly . He has a skinny 6-foot-3 frame and a smile that seems a bit stiff , as if he was caught in an uncomfortable moment at a cocktail_party . Image and Reality In television ads and in speeches , he presents himself as a regular guy with middle-class roots who acquired his huge fortune &quot; with hard work and luck &quot; and a mere $ 1 # 000 investment , underscoring the potential for individual success that makes America great . But a different portrait of Huffington emerges from dozens of interviews with members of his family , friends and colleagues , as well as hours of interviews with him . In this portrait , he is Roy Michael Huffington Jr. , the only son of one of the richest_men in America , the namesake of a father who rose from poverty to become one of the legendary oil and gas wildcatters in Texas history . Much of that wealth was not realized until Huffington was an adult , but there was enough as he was growing_up to send him to an expensive prep_school and the finest universities . Throughout his life , Huffington has been the good son who revered his father , followed his school ' s code of honor , never rebelled in college and then joined the family company at his mother ' s request . Today , based largely on money earned from his father ' s company , Huffington owns mansions in Montecito and Washington . He married Arianna Stassinopoulos , a best-selling biographer renowned for her social connections as well as her quest_for New Age spirituality . Barbara Walters and Lucky Roosevelt were bridesmaids in their splashy New York wedding paid_for by Ann Getty , a Manhattan socialite who introduced them . Huffington spent $ 5.2 million to win his current office , the congressional seat representing Santa Barbara . That works_out to $ 7 # 123 for each day of his two-year term . Huffington cites this spending as a source of independence , calling himself &quot; a political renegade &quot; who does not have to depend_on campaign contributions from special_interests . He describes himself as a political outsider because &quot; I don ' t want to be part of the good old_boy network. &quot; Yet he has been a member of Team California , a group of rich Republicans who pool their contributions of $ 25 # 000 apiece to have a bigger impact . His family ' s oil_business had its own political_action_committee to gain influence and the family ' s donations helped Huffington land his appointment in the Ronald Reagan_Administration . Huffington is reticent about his personal fortune . When it is suggested that his wealth comes primarily from the success of his father , he is testy . &quot; We need to make_sure you guys get paid more money so it won ' t be such a big subject , &quot; he told a reporter at one point . &quot; I have to tell you that a majority of the people , they don ' t care about it . When I go_around walking precincts , people don ' t ask about it. &quot; Huffington says his political ambitions are driven by a spiritual calling to public_service . Although his friends believe he is sincere in his spiritual quest , some consider it a paradox because most of his adult life has been focused_on the acquisition of wealth . Some of his friends and family also see the aspirations of a son who has spent most of his life in the shadow of his father . &quot; It is a classic oldest son trying to strike_out on_his_own to make his mark , &quot; said Dan Case , a San Francisco investment_banker and a longtime friend . &quot; Although he was an extremely good businessman , it would have been difficult for him to make the kind of mark that his father did. &quot; Born Sept . 3 , 1947 , in Dallas , Michael Huffington spent most of his early years living_in a three-bedroom , ranch-style house in the Houston suburb of Bellaire with a workaholic dad , a homemaker mother and a younger sister . Huffington rarely got_out of line , but when he was 7 , his father disciplined him for lighting matches indoors . He was taken into the back yard , given a bucket and a box of matches . His instructions were to strike a match and then drop it in the bucket . &quot; I had to keeping lighting them until I burned my finger , &quot; Huffington said . Strict Upbringing His father eventually gave the same lesson with tobacco and alcohol . &quot; He said : ' You want some cigarettes ? Here are some cigarettes. ' I kept smoking until I turned green . Same thing with drinking . We went_out , when I was of_age , to go drink until I was so sick . . . . I don ' t drink hard alcohol that much because of that. &quot; Huffington heartily endorses the method of discipline . &quot; I think it was very clever , &quot; he said , and intends to use the same technique , if necessary , with his two daughters , ages 2 and 4 . He remembers his father talking to him at great length about the importance of self-sufficiency and education . When Michael was 9 , his father left his job as a geologist for Humble Oil , the precursor to Exxon , to launch his own oil and gas prospecting company . At 14 , Huffington regarded himself as totally unmotivated -- &quot; I was a couch potato . I watched TV all_the time &quot; -- so he asked his parents to send him to Culver Military_Academy in Indiana . &quot; Subconsciously , I knew I needed the discipline to excel , &quot; Huffington said . At Culver , a private_school where tuition and fees now run $ 16 # 950 a year , Huffington worked his way through the ranks to become one of the top student military_officers . He rowed crew and took_pride in strictly adhering to the academy ' s code of honor . &quot; I even turned_in my roommate for being ( five minutes ) late to our room , &quot; Huffington recalled . &quot; And he was higher ranking than I was . But I happened to be the officer on_duty that night . Two days later , he moved_out on me . I don ' t blame him . He was mad at me . The point is , I was abiding_by the rules. &quot; Now , as a member of the academy ' s board of directors , Huffington is a large contributor and recently picked the color of limestone of the school ' s new $ 10-million Huffington Library . After Culver , he attended his father ' s alma_mater , Southern Methodist University in Dallas , and marched with the ROTC . Stanford , which had rejected him because of insufficient grades , admitted him in 1966 when he reapplied . At Stanford , Huffington spent four years rowing crew and pursuing a double degree_program in engineering and economics . He also recalls his first realization that he wanted to enter politics and become a U.S. senator . Yet his tenure at Stanford was marked by an extraordinary indifference to the greatest political and social upheaval of his time . During those years , 1966 to 1970 , Stanford erupted in student anti-war protests . The ROTC office was firebombed . Hundreds of students occupied buildings , thousands boycotted classes and an estimated 80 % of the student body attended one demonstration . None of this made a strong impression on Huffington . He describes his position on the Vietnam_War this way : &quot; I was basically neutral . But I think while I was there , I was probably for it. &quot; As for the prospect of military_service , he said : &quot; I was fully prepared to serve had I been inducted. &quot; He does not recall other feelings one way or the other . Roots of Success During his first four years in college , he had a student deferment . In April of his fifth year , his draft number was called and Huffington went_to an induction center in Houston for his physical exam . &quot; I was in great shape . I rowed crew and I ' d been a swimmer and I thought for_sure I ' d be able to make_it , &quot; Huffington said . &quot; And , lo and behold , they took_a_look at my eyes and they said , ' Forget it . What are you even doing here ? ' &quot; He failed his physical exam on April 13 , 1970 , and soon was classified &quot; not qualified for military_service , &quot; records show . He said he does not know how bad his eyesight was then or is today . He wears hard contact_lenses . Huffington remembers joining the Young Republicans and sitting at a card_table on the Stanford campus to promote Reagan ' s first bid for the presidency in 1968 . &quot; I liked the guy . He seemed optimistic . I am a very optimistic person. &quot; He spent that August in Washington answering phones and running errands for Houston ' s congressman , a former oilman and friend of his father ' s named George_Bush . He remembers it as a time of inspiration . &quot; I thought_of it as a very ethical , good place to go , &quot; Huffington said . Huffington and his roommate , Bob Fink , were elected to two of the four positions as co-presidents of the senior_class . &quot; Mike was basically this incredible straight shooter , &quot; said Fink , now a psychiatrist in Washington state . &quot; It was like he was in his middle_age . He did not rebel at all . He did not smoke dope . . . . He had his mind made_up to where he was going . He was going_to enter the oil_business . It was clear he came from money and was going_to have money. &quot; Huffington recalls trying marijuana &quot; once or twice , &quot; not at Stanford but during his 20s in Houston . &quot; I remember trying it and not liking it. &quot; From Stanford , Huffington went_to Harvard Business_School where his studies kept him too busy to be concerned about politics . &quot; Then Watergate came_along . I was somewhat disillusioned . And then , I forgot about running . I just figured on being a businessman. &quot; In his Senate_campaign , Huffington is running as a successful businessman who can apply his experience to cut government spending . He often portrays himself as a self-made entrepreneur who parlayed a small investment into a fortune . &quot; that ' s what ' s great about America . You can start with $ 1 # 000 and you can end_up making something. &quot; But the record of Huffington ' s 18-year business career presents a less clear picture of unblemished bootstrap success . Only four of those years were spent outside his father ' s firm , and those jobs resulted from school connections or family ties . His career began in 1972 at the First National_Bank of Chicago , where he followed his best_friend at Harvard_University , L.E. Simmons , into the corporate finance office . His two-year stint at the bank led to the break he highlights in his political speeches . In 1974 , Simmons ' older brother , Matt , was approached by a London-based merchant_bank to set_up a Houston affiliate that would provide financial advice to companies working in the oil fields . Matt Simmons said he invited Huffington to join him because Huffington ' s father was a well-respected oilman . &quot; He brought us a lot of credibility , &quot; Matt Simmons said . &quot; Neither of us were from Houston . We needed all_of the help we could get. &quot; The London bank put_up most of the money , but the Simmons brothers and Huffington kicked_in $ 1 # 000 each . This is the $ 1 # 000 investment Huffington refers to when he talks_about his business success . About two years later , however , Huffington and the Simmons brothers bought_out the bank ' s share for nearly $ 500 # 000 . &quot; Around that point_in_time , Mike realized it wasn ' t his cup_of_tea and he wanted to join the family firm , &quot; Matt Simmons said . His departure in 1976 was marked by strained negotiations . Huffington filed a lawsuit , and Matt Simmons said the brothers eventually purchased his shares for about $ 700 # 000 . &quot; Let ' s just say it was a lot of money , &quot; Huffington said . &quot; And , it allowed me the opportunity to buy some stock in my father ' s business. &quot; It also permitted the young bachelor to buy a three-story , 5 # 667-square-foot Houston townhouse with an elevator . Huffington said he joined the family_business because &quot; my mom came_to me and said : ' Look Michael . You ' re dad is stretched . . . . He needs to talk to somebody . He needs somebody with financial business sense. ' &quot; Over the next 14 years , Huffington helped direct a company that struck it rich while he was still in graduate_school . He said his tight-fisted influence and financial acumen helped put the company in a position where it fetched an estimated $ 600 million when it was sold in 1990 . But his critics challenge his contribution to the family_business , saying he was involved in a_couple_of bad deals that cost the company millions and left a group of furious bankers who claimed that he failed to live_up_to his word . His father ' s business , Roy M . Huffington Inc. or Huffco , hit the jackpot in 1971 when it sank an exploratory well that tapped a huge natural_gas reserve on Kalimantan Island in Indonesia . It was the kind of strike that elevated Roy Huffington , a geologist with a Harvard Ph.D. , into the pantheon of Houston wildcatters . But it took years for Roy Huffington to stitch together the financing needed to develop the fields , build a gas liquefying plant in the Indonesian jungle and line_up ocean tankers to haul the gas to Japanese buyers . Family_Business Role Michael Huffington joined Huffco a year before the first tanker eased out of Bontang Bay , Indonesia , with a gas shipment bound for Japan . &quot; There was no revenue from our overseas operations during the first couple of years I was there , &quot; he said . &quot; If things had not gone well , we could have been a complete bust. &quot; With his MBA and banking experience , Michael Huffington spent most of his time at Huffco focused_on the company ' s finances . He said he never saw himself as an oilman like his father , but rather as a financial manager in an oil and gas business . The project that most captured his imagination was a decade-long accumulation of property in downtown Houston . Huffington secretly directed the operation through intermediaries so property_owners would not inflate their prices . Ultimately , Huffco assembled the equivalent of 11 city_blocks . He dreamed about building a self-contained residential community with restaurants , shops and movie_houses . &quot; If I had never wanted to go_into politics , I would have stayed with it and done that. &quot; Huffington believes his most significant role was that of family tightwad . He argued for paying_off debt rather than starting ventures -- a voice that proved prophetic when oil prices tumbled in 1986 . &quot; His job was to keep_down our debts and he did an excellent job at that , &quot; Roy Huffington told The Times . &quot; Mike has always been a fiscal conservative . Even when he was a little fellow , he had a piggy_bank and saved his money very carefully. &quot; Roy Huffington also credits his son with bringing talented financial managers to the firm . Outside of Huffco ' s inner_circle , Michael Huffington sometimes engendered hostility , as might be expected for a boss ' son who quickly rises to become vice_chairman . &quot; He is the typical rich kid who is playing with his father ' s money , &quot; said George Berko , an employee of Huffco ' s partners in Indonesia . &quot; Almost everything he put his hand on failed . He had a refinery and a drilling company that failed . The banks ended_up holding the bag . He made a lot of promises to the banks and ruined his reputation. &quot; Some Failed Ventures In the mid-1980s , two of Huffco ' s subsidiaries collapsed . One was the Independent Valley Energy Co. , a refinery in Bakersfield . The other was Culver Drilling Co. , designed to dig deep wells in Oklahoma . Michael Huffington had arranged the financing for both . Huffington said he never favored the refinery , but he was gung-ho on Culver Drilling Co. , which he named after his high_school academy . When the businesses failed , Huffington left a trail of angry bankers who claim that he offered verbal assurances that Huffco would go beyond written guarantees and cover losses that amounted to tens of millions of dollars . Huffington denies ever making such promises and said Huffco lost &quot; quite a_few million &quot; on Culver Drilling too . &quot; In business , you lose some , you gain some. &quot; Some bankers , who declined to speak on the record , admit they were naive at the time and should share the blame . They said they had long provided loans to his father on the strength of his word , but few of these oral arrangements had been tested because the oil patch was booming . Part of the resentment against Michael Huffington resulted from his hardheaded style . Former employees recall that Huffington insisted that everyone have a clean desk at the end of the day and banished smoking and free coffee from the office for health reasons . &quot; There were a lot of people who felt he was very harsh , &quot; said Bill Taylor , a former employee . &quot; He was harder on me than he had to be . But on a personal basis , he was a good friend , &quot; Taylor said , giving him ample time_off when his wife was dying of cancer . Robert D . Wagner Jr. , a commercial banker , recalled : &quot; There are a lot of guys around who had run-ins with him during negotiations . Some people have the smooth touch and others the bludgeon . He took more the bludgeon approach. &quot; Huffington agrees that he was a tough negotiator but never more abrasive than necessary . He says he was under considerable financial pressure in the mid-1980s . &quot; I was not sleeping well because I was concerned about the future of the firm. &quot; In 1988 , Huffington said he persuaded his father to sell the family ' s domestic oil exploration subsidiary to a French company . The sale price was not disclosed , but Huffington said he found himself flush with cash at age 41 . Roy Huffington had hoped his son would take the reins of the medium-sized oil_company and make_it &quot; monstrous. &quot; But his son had a different idea . He wanted to cash out of the family_business so he could follow his own dreams -- which included moving to California and entering politics . The clincher came when President Bush offered to appoint Roy Huffington the U.S. ambassador to Austria . The family_business , including the property amassed in downtown Houston , was sold to Taiwan ' s Chinese Petroleum Corp . for an estimated $ 600 million . The sale left Roy Huffington , now 76 , as one of the richest_men in America with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $ 310 million . Michael Huffington takes credit for the April , 1990 , timing of the sale , which he said brought the family top dollar during a period of relatively high oil prices . Huffington moved to Montecito with his $ 70-million slice of the profits in 1991 . He purchased a half-interest in Crest Films , a small production company , and encouraged its employees to make more feature_films instead of documentaries and TV ads for big corporations . &quot; The other side of me wants to make movies , &quot; he said . A Philosophical Side Huffington , an Episcopalian , says his quest_for political office is driven by a spiritual calling , a desire to give something back to a country that has given him so_much . According to close friends , Huffington has spent years pondering philosophical questions about the meaning of life , his God-given purpose on Earth , and even why was he born into a family that became so wealthy . &quot; Michael is an extraordinary idealist , &quot; said the Rev . James Parks Morton , an Episcopal priest at the Cathedral of St . John the Divine in New York who is also a close friend and beneficiary of Huffington ' s charitable giving . &quot; He takes all_of this extremely seriously . God put him with these resources to do something good . He sees political leadership as the most important thing he can do. &quot; Huffington often talks_of restoring values in America to solve social ills ranging from teen-age pregnancy to inner-city violence . But these are not the traditional values that have become code words for the religious right . Although Huffington is a fiscal conservative , he breaks from his party on social issues , favoring abortion rights , gun_control and allowing gays in the military . The values he talks_about are discipline , faith and responsibility . In many respects , Huffington ' s spiritual-political quest closely resembles the thesis of his wife ' s book , &quot; The Fourth Instinct : The Call of the Soul. &quot; Her manifesto , released this month , explores the spiritual rewards of altruism and helping the needy . Raised in the Presbyterian_Church , Huffington was drawn to the popular sermons of an Episcopal priest in Houston in the 1980s and soon converted . Huffco associate Mike Decker said Huffington frequently sought his thoughts on fundamental questions about the existence of God , human potential and what he wanted out of life . When Decker wanted to play golf , Huffington would press to go_to dinner for another deep philosophical discussion . &quot; He was so relentless , &quot; Decker said . &quot; At first , it was sort of annoying , but then it became fascinating. &quot; &quot; It is a paradox in a way , &quot; Decker said . &quot; A strong emphasis on material life allowed him to get where he is . Yet his material success allowed his spiritual-creative side to develop. &quot; Huffington said he sees no inconsistency in his transition from hard-nosed businessman to spiritually driven altruist . He said his father &quot; didn ' t go_into his business to make money . . . . Nor was it my pursuit . My pursuit was making things happen , making things grow . I like to build things . Monopoly was a fun game for me. &quot; He also said that he served widely on civic boards and often &quot; shared what I got . I always took people out . I don ' t recall very often anybody paying_for dinner . I took people on trips . I tried to be generous. &quot; Huffington says his political ambition comes from years of philosophical inquiry and prayer . &quot; I ' m absolutely , totally motivated by that , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s why every day I can get_up and feel good about life , because I ' m giving something back. &quot; Asked about what other giving he has done because of his spiritual quest , Huffington said : &quot; I ' ve volunteered time and made contributions to lots of organizations -- too numerous to even remember. &quot; But the only times he can recall volunteering his time to help the needy were when he raised scholarship money at Stanford and served meals last New Year ' s Eve at two homeless shelters in Santa Barbara . After surfacing briefly at Stanford , Huffington ' s dormant interest in politics revived in Houston when he helped set_up phone banks for Bush ' s first presidential campaign in 1980 . He attended the Republican National Convention , painting signs for youthful demonstrators trying to get Bush picked as Reagan ' s running mate . By January , 1984 , he had a discussion with then-Vice President Bush and began a long search for a political appointment in Washington . To Reagan and Bush officials at the White_House he indicated his interest in an array of high-level jobs in Defense , Interior , State and Treasury , White_House records show . &quot; I had to knock_on doors and sell myself , &quot; Huffington said . His job search coincided with a surge in the Huffington family ' s donations to Republican causes , which rose from $ 27 # 500 in the 1981-1982 election cycle to $ 66 # 000 in 1983-84 and $ 95 # 350 in 1985-86 . In a note attached_to his circulating resume , one White_House staffer flagged its importance : &quot; He comes from a prominent GOP family and Craig says he is ' big in oil and gas. ' &quot; President Reagan nominated Huffington for assistant secretary_of_commerce for trade administration in September , 1984 , but pulled the nomination from the Senate a_few months later without explanation . Huffington said White_House officials belatedly learned of a conflict_of_interest . Huffco routinely sought export licenses for its overseas operations from the assistant cmmerce secretary for trade administration . Huffington said he never lobbied government officials on behalf of Huffco . Two years later , Huffington landed a job as a deputy assistant secretary_of_defense . This was a lower-level job than his first , short-lived appointment , but did not require Senate confirmation . In the interim , Huffington met Arianna Stassinopoulos , a native of Greece , on a blind_date arranged by Getty . The way he tells it , he immediately recognized her as his soul_mate when he asked her : &quot; What is the most important thing in your life ? &quot; &quot; God , &quot; she said , without hesitation . They were married within six months . Arianna Huffington , a Cambridge University-educated , best-selling biographer of Pablo Picasso and Maria Callas , had been_on a spiritual journey of_her_own that took her across hot coals and continents to sample various religions . Stint With Pentagon Aside from the Greek Orthodox Church , her longest spiritual association has been with controversial New Age leader John-Roger and his Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness in Santa Monica . Huffington said he has had nothing to do with the Los Angeles group , but has not discouraged his wife ' s affiliation , which began 22 years ago . Shortly after their honeymoon , Huffington began work as deputy assistant secretary_of_defense for negotiations policy . His principal duty was to review Defense_Department position papers on conventional arms reductions and defend these positions at meetings with the State_Department , the CIA and the National Security_Council . His yearlong tour_of_duty was not particularly satisfying , he said , given the tedious progress of arms-control talks in Europe . &quot; The main thing is that I wanted to serve in the Administration , &quot; he said . His staff and superiors said Huffington had little understanding of the highly technical subjects . Many confessed that they were weary of having inexperienced political appointees dumped in their office . &quot; This was a favor to George_Bush who was a friend to the Huffingtons , but it was no favor to the rest of us , &quot; said Frank J . Gaffney Jr. , who shared an office with Huffington and was his immediate supervisor in the final seven months . &quot; The organization continued to toil away under him and in some cases in spite of him , &quot; said Gaffney , now director of the Center for Security Policy in Washington . &quot; It didn ' t matter where he was or what he was doing as long as he wasn ' t doing any damage. &quot; Huffington dismissed Gaffney as a contemptuous boss who never tried to find_out what he was doing . Near the end of his Pentagon employment , the Huffingtons had a stillborn son five months into the pregnancy . Huffington said he was devastated and went_to an Episcopal monastery in New York with Decker , his Huffco colleague . The first 24 hours was spent in total silence , followed by prayer and religious_services . &quot; It was a very contemplative thing , &quot; Decker said . Huffington emerged three days later , talking_about the brevity of life and how it was time to fulfill his long-postponed desire to move to California and get involved in public_service . In March , 1988 , the Huffingtons purchased a $ 4.3-million , 11 # 384-square-foot , Italian-style villa in the_hills of Montecito near Santa Barbara . It was called Villa Ruscello . In 1992 , he challenged and defeated longtime Rep . Robert J . Lagomarsino ( R-Ventura ) in a race that fractured the Santa Barbara County Republican_Party . To win the seat , Huffington spent a record $ 5.2 million of_his_own money , an extravagance that stunned his family and longtime associates who knew him as a penny_pincher . &quot; I was floored when I saw the amounts he was spending , &quot; Decker said . Within a_couple_of months on_the_job , he said Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Texas ) and others began encouraging him to challenge Dianne Feinstein for her Senate seat . He was interested , but did not make a commitment until that August when he traveled_to Greece with Arianna and his two daughters . On the vacation , he briefly left his family to enter a Greek Orthodox monastery on Mt . Athos . For three days , he spent time &quot; praying and just looking over the sea and spending time with the monks , &quot; he said . &quot; Psychologically , I was ready to go_after I came_off Mt . Athos. &quot; Times staff writers Dave Lesher and Glenn F . Bunting contributed to this story . Profile : Michael Huffington Michael Huffington is competing with former Rep . William E .
