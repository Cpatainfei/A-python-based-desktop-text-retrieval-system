   <HEADLINE> STATE ' S SPACE FIRMS ADAPT TO NEW MISSION -- SURVIVAL ; BUSINESS : INDUSTRY IS BUFFETED BY BUDGET FIGHTS , FOREIGN COMPETITION . COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS HELP FILL VOID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kim Garvey , an engineer at McDonnell Douglas Corp . in Huntington Beach , well remembers her seventh birthday . It was July 20 , 1969 -- the day of the first moon landing . &quot; I can remember no one was paying any attention to me on my birthday , &quot; she recalls . &quot; Everybody was watching TV. &quot; Now on the verge of her 32nd birthday and the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar mission , Garvey works_on the team designing the proposed space_station , including the trusses that would form the station ' s backbone . But Garvey and the rest of California ' s space industry face a far more uncertain future than their predecessors did_in the 1960s , when the United States had a singular goal -- beat the Soviet_Union to the moon -- and spared little effort or expense to win the race . That golden era has long passed , replaced by a U.S. space_program whose mission is debated constantly and whose funding is an annual tug-of-war in Congress . Partly as a result , the space business is trying to ensure its survival with its own form of defense conversion . The $ 14 billion being spent by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration this year is 14 % less than the agency spent in 1969 after adjusting for inflation , according to a calculation by UCLA . Indeed , Garvey and the space_station are symptomatic_of the fiscal problems facing the space industry in California , which remains the industrial hub of NASA just as it was 2 1 / 2 decades ago . NASA last year made huge changes in the station ' s design and teamed_up with the Russians to cut the station ' s costs and get_it aloft quicker . Garvey and her colleagues had spent four years working_on the station ' s propulsion_system , but &quot; my job went_away &quot; last year after Russians assumed that role , she said . She was lucky enough to find work_on other parts of the station , but her new job is not secure either . After much debate , Congress looks ready to approve another $ 2.1 billion for the station for this year , but the process must be repeated next year and each year after that . Each year , the station could be canceled altogether . &quot; It ' s frustrating , &quot; Garvey said . &quot; It would be nice if there were multiyear budgets where you knew for the next five years if there was going_to be a stable program. &quot; Budget squabbles aren ' t the only hurdles for the state ' s space industry . There are fewer contracts to build defense satellites and other military space gear because of Pentagon spending_cuts . Worldwide competition in markets such_as launch rockets is getting more intense . These pressures have been building for years and have forced California ' s space industry to slash costs or merge . The state has lost about 30 # 000 space jobs since the mid-1980s , including 1 # 700 lost at the McDonnell plant in Huntington Beach , which now employs 6 # 500 . Nonetheless , space is still a huge business in California -- and will remain so even if the space_station eventually is canceled . The largest share of NASA ' s annual budget , about $ 4 billion , still goes_to California firms . That spending directly employs 37 # 000 people , or 24 % of all NASA-funded jobs , the highest level in the nation , according to the governor ' s office . Some 4 # 000 of those jobs are dedicated to the space_station . The total number of space-related jobs in California is probably closer to 60 # 000 when contracts from the Pentagon , foreign customers and commercial clients are included . Throw_in the jobs indirectly tied to space and the number climbs well above 100 # 000 . There are also hundreds of engineers , scientists and computer_experts at firms that provide extra brainpower and services to the space industry . They include the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , and Aerospace Corp . and Computer_Sciences Corp. , both in El Segundo . All have had to tighten their belts because of the drop_in U.S. space spending . But many also are developing products for commercial users , and those customers are funneling an ever-growing number of dollars into California ' s space industry . &quot; If you go_back a_few years ago , there was almost no commercial space market , &quot; said Daniel Goodman , an analyst at EDS Management Consulting Services in Washington . &quot; Its growth has been remarkable. &quot; No one is exactly sure how big that market is , but consider : * Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft Co . is launching a commercial satellite-to-home TV service_called DirecTV , is building Malaysia ' s first communications satellite , and plans to launch a $ 660-million , twin-satellite system dubbed Spaceway that would provide &quot; on demand &quot; telecommunications services early in the next century . * Lockheed Corp. ' s Sunnyvale-based space group , a leading satellite builder for the U.S._government , is also making satellites for Motorola ' s Iridium cellular_telephone project and marketing Russian-built rockets to other launch customers . * NASA ' s biggest contractor , Seal Beach-based Rockwell International , is using the Pentagon ' s satellite-based global positioning system to develop electronic maps for Oldsmobile cars and tracking-data devices for commercial truck fleets . * TRW ' s space group in Redondo Beach , a leading builder of defense and scientific satellites , recently won a $ 61-million contract to build the first satellite for Taiwan ' s new civilian space_program . TRW also is using space technology to enhance the features of its vehicle air-bag restraint business . Companies are hustling for these markets because they don ' t expect a rebound in NASA and Pentagon spending for space before the next century . &quot; We look_at NASA ' s prospects at best as flat , &quot; said Mel R . Brashears , vice_president of Lockheed ' s Space Systems Division . Yet as promising as the commercial market might be , it is unclear whether those sales will ever grow large enough to offset the loss of government space contracts and fill the void left by the massive layoffs . &quot; While we are looking_at opportunities in commercial and international space arenas , they will not be a big portion of our business in the near future , &quot; said Fred Brown , vice_president for group development at TRW ' s space unit . As a result , some space experts believe , the number of workers is not expected to grow much and long-term job security will virtually disappear . &quot; Even though we expect to do more ( commercial ) dollar work in the future , we also expect to be more efficient , &quot; Brown said . Anthony Cepavicius , a 39-year McDonnell Douglas veteran in Huntington Beach , where McDonnell built a part of the Saturn V rocket that lifted Apollo 11 to the moon , said not many younger people will have careers in space as long as his . &quot; There ' s not going_to be as_many long-term programs , &quot; said Cepavicius , now 61 and a tooling inspector on the space_station project . &quot; You ' re going to see very few people like myself with 40 years &quot; in the business . Yet others are more optimistic , saying commercial and foreign customers will provide the state ' s industry with substantial growth in the 21st Century . Simon Ramo , 81 , co-founder and former chairman of TRW , said the burgeoning commercial markets , combined with the &quot; continued need &quot; for U.S. research and military spacecraft , will give the industry annual sales &quot; substantially in excess &quot; of those in the 1990s . EDS ' Goodman said the much-heralded information superhighway of the future will rely heavily on satellites , in addition to ground-based wired communications_systems . &quot; But it ' s going_to take longer than people had hoped , &quot; at least a decade , he said . In the meantime the space industry is still retrenching -- and many Californians are still losing their jobs . Just last month , Martin Marietta Corp . said it will move most of its Atlas rocket business from San Diego to Denver , where the company builds its Titan rockets . About 1 # 400 jobs will be transferred , 400 will be eliminated and 300 will remain in San Diego . Rockwell Chairman Donald R . Beall , whose company built the Apollo 11 command_module and the space shuttles , noted that Rockwell is also under pressure to keep cutting the shuttle fleet ' s operating_costs in the face of NASA ' s tight budgets . That means doing the same work with fewer people , and &quot; it will be difficult to keep it ( space employment ) where it is , &quot; he said . The four shuttles were manufactured and are still repaired by Rockwell at its plants in Downey , Palmdale and Edwards Air_Force Base , and its Rocketdyne unit in Canoga Park builds the shuttles ' main engines . ( Rockwell ' s fifth shuttle was the Challenger , which exploded in 1986. ) In May , Rockwell workers in Palmdale finished a $ 74-million upgrade of the shuttle Atlantis , which is scheduled to fly again in October . But they also began modifying Atlantis so the shuttle can eventually dock with the U.S.-Russian space_station . Elsewhere in the state , TRW -- which built the smaller engine for the lunar landing_craft that lowered Neil Armstrong and Edwin ( Buzz ) Aldrin Jr . to the moon ' s Sea of Tranquillity -- today builds communications , observatory and early warning defense satellites . Examples : Tracking and data relay satellites , which form the backbone of NASA ' s space-to-ground communications ; satellites that analyze the Earth ' s ozone_layer , and scientific and intelligence satellites for the Defense_Department . Lockheed , besides working_on the Iridium project , assembled and serviced the Hubble Space Telescope and services the shuttle fleet between launches . The company also is launching a business , called Space Imaging , to provide commercial high-resolution images of Earth taken from satellites . McDonnell Douglas , in addition to its space_station , is developing a radical launch rocket called the Delta Clipper-Experimental . The rocket blasts_off and lands vertically and is one of several &quot; single-stage-to-orbit &quot; rockets that are being developed as potential alternatives to the shuttles , whose missions cost $ 360 million apiece on average . Despite all_the research into what space_vehicles will be used in the future , the shuttles keep flying -- keeping Rockwell as NASA ' s biggest supplier . &quot; We see the shuttle operating for the next 20 or 30 years , &quot; Beall said . But he knows that with NASA budgets shrinking , Rockwell must keep reducing the cost of flying the shuttle -- or risk accelerating Uncle_Sam ' s search for a cheaper , replacement space_vehicle . Early in the next century , it is possible that Rockwell will be asked to build more shuttles . A permanent space_station could be orbiting the Earth . A manned trip to Mars might be given serious consideration . All would help protect California ' s space industry and its workers . But those scenarios are expensive , so none is likely to happen without first sparking intense debate over whether the projects are worth taxpayers ' money . In any case , the industry by then could be supported more by commercial sales than by NASA . that ' s a far_cry from the days of the Apollo_program , said TRW ' s Brown . &quot; There ' s clearly been a major change , &quot; he said . &quot; All of it revolves_around the fact we don ' t have the Soviet_Union to compete with anymore. &quot; Major Space Sites Southern California is the industrial center for the nation ' s space effort . A look_at some of the industry ' s major facilities : Rockwell International Corp . ( Canoga Park , Downey , Palmdale ) , services the space shuttles ( which it built ) in Downey and Palmdale . Its Rocketdyne unit in Canoga Park builds / services the shuttles ' main engines , builds engines for the Delta and Atlas launch rockets and is working_on the proposed space_station .
