   <HEADLINE> FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES : IS IT BECAUSE HE ' S TORI ' S DAD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent poll by the Times Mirror Center for the People &amp; the Press found that only 50 % of Americans correctly named Boris Yeltsin as Russia ' s president . That was better than the 13 % who knew that Boutros Boutros-Ghali is the United Nations secretary_general and the 40 % who knew that the Palestinians are the people with whom Israel reached a peace accord . So who are Americans familiar_with ? According to a new Gallup Poll , 69 % of adults age 18 to 49 can successfully identify television producer Aaron Spelling . Spelling ' s work includes such current hit shows as &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 &quot; and &quot; Melrose Place &quot; as well as such older shows as &quot; Charlie ' s Angels &quot; and &quot; The Love Boat. &quot; Balkan Surprise One of the more colorful characters in the ongoing saga of beleaguered studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is Giovanni DiStefano , a former Beverly Hills resident and associate of former MGM owner Giancarlo Parretti . DiStefano got a batch of ink in late 1992 when he proclaimed he was buying the studio with colorful financier Bernard Cornfeld . The studio laughed_off DiStefano ' s bid . An update on DiStefano was published last week in the Sunday Star Times in New Zealand , where DiStefano remains a notorious figure , having been banned there after an alleged investment scam . DiStefano is now a Serbian businessman , the newspaper said , heading a multimillion housing housing project . Among the bizarre revelations in the story is that DiStefano ' s passport &quot; bears the home address of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. &quot; The President and the King The death last month of former President Richard Nixon has sparked a renewed interest in his Administration , as evidenced by the attention given diaries of his late chief_of_staff , H.R. Haldeman . Now comes what undoubtedly is the most unusual Nixon nostalgia book : &quot; The Day Elvis Met Nixon. &quot; The $ 18.95 book , for_sale at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda , is an account of the half-hour 1970 meeting between Nixon and Elvis written by Egil ( Bud ) Krogh , former Nixon deputy counsel and meeting eyewitness . The book reveals that Krogh first learned Elvis wanted to meet Nixon with &quot; Elvis handing a letter requesting to see the President to a startled guard at the Northwest Gate of the White House. &quot; Krogh says Nixon and Elvis rummaged through a drawer looking_at such presidential souvenirs as golf_balls , cuff links and pins . The book also pictures an honorary badge Nixon presented Elvis making him a special assistant in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs , something historians have noted as ironic given revelations about Presley ' s drug habits that emerged after he died . Also included is what undoubtedly are some of the last words penned by Nixon . On the back of the cover is a statement from Nixon dated eight days before he died congratulating Krogh on the book , saying it &quot; shatters many of the myths that have spread &quot; about the meeting .</TEXT>
