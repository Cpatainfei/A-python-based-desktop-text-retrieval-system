   <HEADLINE> FOR AGASSI , THE U.S. OPEN IS NOT A SHUT CASE -- YET ; TENNIS : LONGSHOT FROM LAS VEGAS PLAYS MARTIN AND STICH FACES NOVACEK IN TODAY ' S SEMIFINALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The men ' s semifinals of the Andre Agassi-U.S. Open tennis tournament will be played today . Actually , Agassi is not a sponsor of the event . He merely owns it this year . The unseeded Agassi began the tournament as both a Las Vegas longshot and a longshot from Las Vegas . And in his non-matching blue and black tennis outfit , long straggly hair flowing_from under his black cap toward his black socks and black_and_white shoes , he is a sight to behold . But he is the apple of tennis fans ' eye in the Big Apple . &quot; Everybody is talking_about Andre , everybody thinking he is going_to win , and that ' s just the way I like it , &quot; said Michael Stich of Germany , another semifinalist , who will play Karel Novacek of the Czech Republic . Many believe Stich , seeded fourth , will get_through to Sunday ' s final and give the tennis world a matchup of former Wimbledon champions , Stich having won in 1991 and Agassi in 1992 . It would be strawberries and cream in Flushing Meadow , which , hopefully , would be better than it sounds . But before either gets_to Sunday , when a victory by Agassi would make him only the second man in the history of the tournament -- since Vic Seixas in 1954 -- to take_out five seeded players , each must pass a formidable test . Agassi will play Todd Martin , the other seeded player who got_through to the semifinals in a men ' s draw as full of casualties as your basic Clipper transaction . Martin , seeded ninth , is the only male to have made_it to the semifinals of three Grand_Slam events this year . He lost in the final of the Australian to Pete Sampras and in the semifinals at Wimbledon to Sampras . Martin has played Agassi five times and won three matches , among them a five-setter this year at Wimbledon . At 24 , Martin is the same age as Agassi , but he started his climb_on the tour much later than Agassi , who , in his early teens , left the bright lights of Las Vegas for the bright lights of the Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida . When Agassi was playing Ivan Lendl in the semifinals of this tournament in 1988 , at 18 , Martin was out on one of the back courts , playing in the junior boys ' event . Martin , 6-feet-6 and kind of a gentle giant , did the unthinkable and unforgivable for those who are to make_it big on the pro tennis tour : He went_to college , Northwestern University , and stayed for two years . Nevertheless , it is fair to say that both are educated in the Greek tradition . Martin read Socrates , Agassi read Nick . On the court , Agassi is an all-court player , capable of rallying with anybody from the backcourt , capable of returning anybody ' s serve and capable of serving and volleying , if necessary . He is fast , flamboyant , flashy . Martin is an all-court player too , capable of playing well from the backcourt and capable of serving and volleying with the best of them . He is not fast , not flamboyant and not flashy . The likely key to this match is that Martin will serve 110-m.p.h. shots at Agassi , who might very well return them at about 115 . The big serve will also be a big issue in the Stich-Novacek semifinal . Stich has a first serve that frequently exceeds 120 . Novacek ' s is slightly slower but so effective that he hit 28 aces in his five-set semifinal victory over Jaime Yzaga of Peru . The difference will be that Stich follows his big serve to the net , whereas Novacek stands at the baseline and admires his . They have played six times and Stich has won four matches , on various surfaces . For Stich , who has gone_out early in most Grand_Slam events since his 1991 victory over Boris Becker in the Wimbledon final , this U.S. Open is nevertheless somewhat familiar territory . Not so for Novacek , a 29-year-old veteran , who is known for playing lots of tournaments and having lots of single-day successes , but never really breaking_through in a big tournament . For him , this is Christmas in September . &quot; I have been playing masters , I have been playing everything basically that exists in tennis , &quot; he said after beating Yzaga . &quot; But I never went_to a semifinal of a Grand_Slam , so today I am very happy. &quot; Novacek , ranked No . 56 in the world , will also be the longest longshot to get_through to Sunday . Stich , who has his remarkably fluid game flowing quite nicely now , might be the pick of the savvy tennis insiders . Martin will be the choice and heartthrob of middle America , whose values and style he so clearly represents . And Agassi ? What should he care ? He owns this place .</TEXT>
