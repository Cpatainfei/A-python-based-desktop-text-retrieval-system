   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT PLEDGES TO CLEAN_UP PLO ' S BOOKS ; MIDEAST : PRESSURED BY THE U.S. AND EGYPT , PALESTINIAN LEADER SAYS HE WILL DO WHAT ' S NECESSARY TO CLEAR WAY FOR OUTSIDE AID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , responding to blunt warnings from both the United States and Egypt , promised Saturday to straighten_out the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s chaotic financial management and complete long-delayed paperwork to clear the way for badly needed international aid . In back-to-back meetings , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told Arafat that the fledgling Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho must act at once to convince international donors that aid money will be properly spent . According to a senior U.S. official , Arafat pledged to sign a U.S. private investment agreement that has been delayed since June and to complete project specifications required by the World_Bank , most of them pending for months . He also said the Palestinian Authority has begun collecting taxes after a slow start . At the same time , Christopher said he has written to the world ' s richest countries urging them to begin honoring more_than $ 2 billion in pledges made last year to finance the experiment in Palestinian self-government . &quot; Time is of_the_essence , &quot; Christopher said during a joint news_conference with Mubarak . &quot; It is important to have projects on the ground &quot; to show restless Palestinians that last September ' s peace agreement with Israel will pay_off in improved living conditions . Christopher visited Alexandria , Mubarak ' s vacation_home , at the start of a trip to the Middle_East during which he hopes to narrow the differences between Israel and Syria in what remains the region ' s most perplexing conflict . During Christopher ' s flight from Washington , a senior U.S. official said Syria and Israel are engaged in serious and substantive negotiations through a U.S. go-between . But he said that no final agreement will be possible until Jerusalem and Damascus resume face-to-face talks . The United States and its allies have become increasingly impatient with the sloppy bookkeeping , inept fiscal management and cumbersome administration of the PLO-run government in Gaza and Jericho . Christopher has often urged Arafat to get his house in_order , without much effect . This time , the Clinton_Administration tried to double-team the PLO leader . At Washington ' s suggestion , Mubarak invited Arafat to lunch before the Egyptian president ' s meeting with Christopher . U.S. officials said Arafat was then invited to join the Mubarak-Christopher meeting because he had seemed cooperative in his talks with the Egyptian president . The senior U.S. official said Mubarak talked very little during the three-way meeting but that &quot; the chairman seems to be more responsive in making commitments when he is in the presence of President Mubarak. &quot; The official confirmed that Arafat did not bring any of the long-delayed documents with him but that &quot; there were some very clear commitments. &quot; &quot; The ( World ) Bank has a fair number of projects that are ready to put contracts_out on , but they require final project design specifications from the Palestinians , &quot; the official said . &quot; That has not been finished , even though it was requested more_than a month ago. &quot; He said the PLO has not yet signed an agreement with the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp . -- a step required for U.S. private loans -- although Washington submitted the plan in June . The official said Arafat promised to sign the agreement &quot; immediately. &quot; The Palestinian Authority is desperate for cash to finance its police and other government operations . But the PLO has resisted demands for greater accountability . &quot; The hang-ups on the projects have a lot to do with documentation , &quot; the U.S. official said . &quot; The hang-ups on disbursement have a lot do with filing receipts. &quot; Following his meetings in Alexandria , Christopher flew to Israel , where he planned preliminary talks before heading for Damascus today to confer_with Syrian President Hafez Assad . The Israel-Syria negotiations mark the most important phase of Christopher ' s Mideast trip .</TEXT>
