   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SCHOOL MAY BE ABANDONED BECAUSE OF QUAKE DAMAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ground beneath Van Gogh Street Elementary School in Granada Hills is so unstable and crisscrossed by fissures that the site will probably have to be abandoned , Los Angeles school officials said Thursday . Officials predict , however , that the 370-student school will be the only campus to be shut_down because of significant quake damage that struck about 100 schools and cost $ 700 million throughout the sprawling district . Supt . Sid Thompson announced the opening today of 14 more San Fernando Valley campuses that have been closed since the Jan . 17 quake . Another 33 schools , all_in the Valley , remain closed , leaving about 40 # 000 Los Angeles students out of school for two weeks . The most severely damaged campuses -- two high_schools , Kennedy and El Camino Real ; four middle_schools , Northridge , Lawrence , San Fernando and Frost , and two elementary_schools , San Fernando and Van Gogh -- have been dubbed the &quot; Big Eight &quot; by school officials because of the severity of damage and uncertainty over when they can reopen . &quot; I anticipate by Monday morning we can give definitive information on what happens at each of these schools , &quot; Thompson said . &quot; We realize you want your young people back . We will bring them back when it is safe. &quot; Options include installing mobile classrooms in safe areas , finding alternative space in commercial and other buildings or transferring students to nearby schools . Doug Brown , director of school facilities , told the school_board Thursday that the latest geological survey of Van Gogh presents a bleak picture . A deep crack snakes its way through the main corridor , and several other fissures are visible throughout the campus . Several deep cracks have broken classroom and hallway floors . The campus has no water . An ominous sign greets visitors at the entrance to Van Gogh : &quot; Parents : Please Leave Children Outside. &quot; Principal Maureen Diekmann said she is considering relocating the students to Frost Middle_School . District officials also announced that every school in the district has been given $ 5 per student to spend on emergency quake-related counseling , health_care or the purchase of school supplies . Hard-hit campuses received $ 15 a student , aid provided by the U.S. Department_of_Education .
