   <HEADLINE> ALLSTATE ALSO STOPS ISSUING POLICIES FOR HOMEOWNERS ; INSURANCE : MOVE IS LATEST IN SERIES FOLLOWING THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Allstate Insurance Co. , California ' s second-largest homeowners insurer , suspended the sale of new property and earthquake insurance Thursday , saying it &quot; could not afford to be the only game in town &quot; after other major carriers had pulled_out of the market . The action reflects what Allstate chief counsel Robert Pike called &quot; a grossly dysfunctional market , if not a market meltdown , &quot; arising from the Northridge earthquake . Allstate ' s move means that none of California ' s top three carriers -- including State Farm Mutual Automobile_Insurance Co . and Farmers Insurance Group -- is actively writing new homeowners policies , and a slew of smaller companies have restricted their writings . Consumers , who were already having problems finding homeowner coverage , can expect those difficulties to increase . Allstate said it will renew existing policies and will write new policies for current customers who are buying new homes . The company will also honor its commitments on new policies that are still in the processing stage , Pike said . Gov . Pete Wilson has expressed concern that the lack of insurance availability could disrupt real_estate sales and harm the economic recovery . Wilson , state regulators and legislators , consumer representatives and insurance industry officials have been meeting in recent days to discuss possible legislative solutions to the problem . The insurance industry is pushing for a repeal of the state law that requires homeowners insurers to offer their customers earthquake coverage . Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi last week ordered the California Fair Plan -- the state ' s high-risk property insurance pool -- to extend its residential and earthquake insurance statewide in_order to provide last-resort coverage for consumers who can ' t find it elsewhere . The Fair Plan offers stripped-down fire_insurance policies without liability coverage . A spokesman for Garamendi said Thursday that Allstate ' s action was anticipated and that the Fair Plan should be able to cope_with the demand for coverage , at least in the short term . State Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee and Democratic nominee for insurance commissioner , said he was investigating whether the insurers ' withdrawals from the homeowners and earthquake market might constitute an illegal boycott of California . The dominoes started falling June 9 when 20th Century Industries ' two insurance subsidiaries -- facing claims of more_than $ 600 million from the Jan . 17 quake -- abruptly stopped writing new homeowners policies and stopped renewing existing earthquake coverage . Farmers Insurance Group , California ' s No . 3 carrier , followed June 16 by suspending its writings of new homeowners and earthquake coverage . State Farm , under a &quot; managed growth program , &quot; is accepting new customers only as old ones leave . Safeco Insurance Co. , Chubb Group and TIG Insurance Co . are other large carriers that have restricted their sales . As a result , Allstate says , it has been left holding the bag . The company in recent weeks has been writing at the rate of about 19 # 000 new property policies a month -- up 30 % over last year ' s levels , said chief counsel Pike . And in the Los Angeles area , where a higher proportion of customers opt_for earthquake coverage , new business has increased by 40 % over last year , he said .</TEXT>
