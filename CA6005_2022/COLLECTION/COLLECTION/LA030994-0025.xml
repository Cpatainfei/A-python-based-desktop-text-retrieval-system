   <HEADLINE> NUSSBAUM WAS SERVING THE WRONG MASTER ; WHITEWATER : THE WHITE_HOUSE COUNSEL IS NOT THE PRESIDENT ' S PERSONAL LAWYER ; HE WORKS FOR THE GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This week thousands of law_students across the country will be taking a mandatory &quot; professional responsibility &quot; examination , which tests their knowledge of the laws , rules and ethical principles that govern the practice_of_law . Someone should save a seat for recently deposed White_House counsel Bernard W . Nussbaum , though he might have a serious problem passing the test . The former Wall_Street corporate litigator appears to have forgotten at least one of the basics of legal ethics -- loyalty to one ' s client . What ? Didn ' t Nussbaum do everything to zealously protect Bill_Clinton ' s position in the brewing Whitewater scandal ? After all , he shielded documents , fought a special prosecutor and met with federal regulators . What more could he have done for Clinton ? The problem is that Clinton was not his client . Nussbaum ' s client was the United States_government , not the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . The White_House counsel is a public_servant paid by the government , not by the President . When it became clear to Nussbaum that any connection Clinton might have had to the case in Arkansas did not involve his duties as President , Nussbaum should have taken the steps necessary to separate himself from the President . Granted , taking this step would not have been easy , considering the political realities and the years of friendship with the President . But the American Bar Assn . model rules of professional conduct make_it very clear that a lawyer who represents a government_agency , like a lawyer who represents a corporation , owes a duty to the agency , not to any one individual in the agency . Imagine the situation if Nussbaum were an attorney for a major corporation whose CEO had legal problems stemming from his previous job . You can bet the board of directors would not be pleased if their general counsel was spending his time on a matter unrelated to the CEO ' s current job . While it may be politically naive to think that this general rule covers the White_House , there is no ethical reason to make an exception for the President . Nussbaum should have counseled the President that it was in the government ' s best interest to turn_over all information related to Whitewater as quickly as possible . If the President refused , Nussbaum should have stepped aside and advised him to obtain independent counsel . If the President refused that advice and ordered Nussbaum to continue working_on Whitewater , Nussbaum should have resigned . This may have been what happened but I doubt it . Nussbaum believed and acted_as every White_House counsel before him has -- as if the President was his client . He was wrong . But that isn ' t why he was asked by the President to take the sacrificial bullet . He was fired not because of his tactics but because they didn ' t work . This means that there still may be a serious problem in the White_House . Either the President and his advisers do not understand what the proper role of White_House counsel is , or , worse yet , they understand but don ' t care . Somebody in the government -- the attorney_general ? -- must have the political courage to make_it clear to the President that the White_House counsel can represent the interest of the President only when the President is acting in his official capacity . For any other legal advice or service , the President must do just what the rest of us have to do when we have a legal problem : Go_out and hire a private attorney .</TEXT>
