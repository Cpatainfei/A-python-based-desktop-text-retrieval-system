   <HEADLINE> JEFF WHITE WANTS TO REVITALIZE THE STATE CHAPTER OF OPERATION RESCUE . BUT THE ISSUE OF VIOLENCE MIGHT IMPEDE HIS EFFORTS. ; OPERATION REBOUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is late into a crystal-clear fall night high above the Southern California urban landscape , and Jeff White and Joe Foreman are wolfing_down steaks at a local restaurant , trading war stories from the front_lines of the Christian fundamentalist battle against abortion -- and plotting a comeback . White , the 37-year-old leader of Operation Rescue of California , has retreated from his former base in Orange County to this resort town near Lake Arrowhead to regroup his battered organization , now one of the last active statewide chapters left in_Operation Rescue . And he has just enlisted Foreman , who was ousted from the national leadership of the anti-abortion group four years ago as a result of his radical views and his repeated personality clashes with founder Randall Terry , to help him re-energize a grass-roots movement politically devastated by the effect of anti-abortion violence . Since a major protest campaign in the summer of 1993 that targeted clinics in the San Jose area , White , a born-again former BMW parts distributor from Santa Clara and the father of seven children , has been unable to generate much attention for his organization , and financial contributions have been halved over the past year . Like other anti-abortion leaders , he manages to make ends meet for his group and for his family through cash and in-kind donations from a hard-core group of loyal supporters in the fundamentalist community ; he and his family are now living_in a townhouse here , and he keeps his group ' s offices in a second one nearby . Nonetheless , it is clear that Operation Rescue of California is now just a shadow of the powerful statewide force that was able to blockade dozens of clinics and put thousands of protesters onto Southern California streets in the late 1980s . To return to his glory days , White , with Foreman ' s help , is organizing a team of 10 full-time fundamentalist , anti-abortion &quot; missionaries &quot; at his office to rebuild a statewide activist network . &quot; There is an awful lot you can do when people think you ' ve been beaten , &quot; says Foreman confidently . Yet as they try to resurrect their struggling cause , White and Foreman find themselves embroiled in increasingly bitter battles with rival leaders across the country over how to keep Operation Rescue afloat at a time when a wave of violence has led to declining membership and plunging financial donations for anti-abortion groups from their traditional base among Christian fundamentalists . And that fight shows the degree to which the violence against abortion doctors by a handful of extremists -- two doctors have been killed within the last two years , and a third has been wounded -- has come_to dominate the entire national debate over abortion , especially inside the anti-abortion movement itself . In fact , White ' s decision to bring Foreman to California has been enough to create a serious rift between White and Flip Benham , the national director of Operation Rescue , largely because of questions about Foreman ' s track record on the issue of violence . White and Foreman have not been linked to any acts of violence , but Benham believes that leaders of the movement have to make_it clear to the world that they do not even tacitly endorse it . That is especially true since Operation Rescue continues to target doctors by name for protest and personal harassment , and its leaders identify doctors by name during rallies and charge that they are baby killers . If Operation Rescue officially took the next step and openly supported the murder of the doctors that its leaders identify , the group would almost certainly bring the wrath of the federal_government down upon its head . Benham , a Dallas fundamentalist minister , has been outspoken in denouncing the attacks on abortion physicians ; he argues such public statements are the only way to protect Operation Rescue from the pressure of federal conspiracy investigations and political ostracism . So he angrily charges that White and Foreman endanger Operation Rescue ' s credibility because they have refused to join him in openly opposing the violence . In fact , the ambivalence with which leaders like White and Foreman have greeted the violence has already sparked a firestorm of protest from many abortion-rights advocates , who chide that some anti-abortion leaders are guilty of encouraging acts of violence by &quot; praising with faint damns. &quot; What ' s more troubling for Foreman is that he is finding it hard to live_down his past . He initially allowed his name to be attached -- and then had it quickly removed -- from a petition passed_around earlier this year by extremist Paul Hill endorsing the &quot; justifiable homicide &quot; of doctors who perform abortions . Later , Hill was arrested for the August killings of Dr. John Britton and his escort in Pensacola , Fla. ; those who signed his petition have come under growing scrutiny from law-enforcement officials . Before the killings , Foreman also hosted a summit_meeting of anti-abortion leaders in Chicago to debate whether violence was justified ; the meeting was dominated by supporters of violence , including Hill . Foreman ' s credibility on nonviolence has also been eroded by his past leadership of a Milwaukee group called the Missionaries to the Pre-Born , which he co-founded with the Rev . Matt Trewhella , reportedly a target of a federal investigation of a possible conspiracy in a campaign of violence against abortion clinics . So by bringing Foreman to California , White has left rival leaders guessing about his future policies . &quot; Jeff White is no longer a spokesman for Operation Rescue , &quot; says Benham flatly . &quot; There are too many unanswered questions . . . . I absolutely have a big problem with the fact that he is dealing with someone like Foreman . And if Foreman is not_able to toe_the_line on the issue , then he cannot speak_for Operation Rescue either. &quot; Yet despite the attacks from Benham , White and Foreman still refuse to publicly denounce all anti-abortion violence -- clouding their hopes to bring their California operation back to life in the coming months . White and Foreman argue that they are being misunderstood both by their rivals in the movement and by the media . &quot; Martin_Luther_King Jr . preached the same creed of nonviolence from day one until he was shot , but the way he was portrayed in the press changed dramatically ; at first he was viewed very negatively , and only later did the press recognize what he was about , &quot; observes Foreman . &quot; I think in the long_run , it will be seen that there is a distinction between Operation Rescue and those who advocate and commit violence. &quot; Still , talking to White and Foreman about their rather tortured and complex views on violence makes_it clear why Benham is confused about where they stand . White and Foreman insist that they personally oppose the use of violence , and that neither of them would tolerate anyone in their organization who committed violent acts . &quot; I know absolutely , positively that violence is not the answer , and I think for someone to insinuate something different after all these years that we have been in the movement is out of line , &quot; notes White . Yet at_the_same_time , they refuse to speak out against all acts of anti-abortion violence , and complain that Benham ' s hard-line stance against dealing with any leading advocates of &quot; justifiable homicide &quot; only polarizes the anti-abortion movement , and divides longtime allies who worked together for years before violence against doctors became an issue . &quot; By pushing ( Benham ' s ) line , you keep people from coming_together , &quot; says Foreman . He adds that he has trouble condemning advocates of violence because he is not convinced that all acts of anti-abortion violence &quot; are intrinsically a sin. &quot; &quot; There are people all_over the map on this issue in the anti-abortion movement , and many of them agonize over whether they would endorse violence in different hypothetical situations , and I don ' t want to get_into that debate. &quot; White says he believes that by not speaking out against violence , he can keep more people inside what he insists is a nonviolent movement , thus ensuring that anti-abortion activists don ' t get so frustrated that they turn_to violence . &quot; I believe that the answer is not in shooting abortionists , but in laying_down your life ( through nonviolence ) for the children , &quot; White says . &quot; That is the history of the true church . I did not sell my business and my home to lead a secret life . &quot; But I do not engage in debate over the justifications of violence . I ' m a leader , not a debater . I make_it clear that if anyone wants to be in an Operation Rescue of California event , they will follow the path of nonviolence . But if a person will commit their life to nonviolence , not just when they are at an Operation Rescue event but all_the time , then I don ' t care where they are_on the spectrum of thinking_about violence as an issue . I don ' t care what they think , as long as they commit in action to nonviolence . &quot; Tactically , what ' s the best way to reduce violence ? &quot; White asks . &quot; Is it to polarize those who are_on the fence , to shut them out and push them to violence , or to keep them busy with nonviolence ? &quot; Ironically , the attacks on White and Foreman over their views on violence come at_the_same_time they have been attempting to organize a &quot; peace summit &quot; with abortion-rights advocates in Southern California to talk_about the issue of violence . White says he ' s amused that Benham also has chastised him for sitting_down with the enemy , even while he criticizes White for his refusal to speak out more clearly about violence . Yet abortion-rights advocates , meanwhile , have dismissed White ' s attempts to organize meetings with them about violence , arguing that he is simply trying to generate publicity for his shrinking organization . &quot; We have nothing to talk to Jeff White about ; there is no common_ground , &quot; says Leslie Sebastian , a spokesman for Planned Parenthood in the San Diego area . Yet in spite of his troubles stemming from the violence issue , White remains confident that he and his group will ultimately be back in good graces with other anti-abortion leaders like Benham . &quot; I am confident that Flip and I will be able to work together again , maybe before the year is out , maybe even sooner , &quot; says White . &quot; Hey , I ' ve been thrown_out of Operation Rescue and thrown_back in more times than anybody else , but it doesn ' t matter . I don ' t hold grudges . If you are pro-life , then I am your friend. &quot;</TEXT>
