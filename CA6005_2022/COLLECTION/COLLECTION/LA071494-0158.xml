   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / SEMIFINALS ; FAN-TASTIC SEMIFINALS ; FOR BRAZILIANS , A SAMBA OF CELEBRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Burgos sisters have transplanted a little bit of Rio to Venice Boulevard , and their compatriots have embraced their Zabumba restaurant in West Los Angeles as &quot; the Brazilian party place in L.A. &quot; &quot; Carnival is once a year in Brazil , &quot; said Monica Burgos . &quot; Here , it ' s every day. &quot; Five months ago , Monica , 26 , and her sisters Carla , 30 , and Jeane , 28 , took_over what was then a moribund Zabumba , turning it into a restaurant so popular that fire_marshals ordered it closed during Brazil ' s World Cup victory over Russia after the crowd swelled seriously beyond capacity . For Brazil ' s match with Sweden at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday , the crowd returned -- confident and ready to party -- but only 100 could get inside . No matter , at least 100 more partied outside , where police had cordoned off the area with yellow crime-scene tape . More_than an hour before game time , the music and its infectious beat already had begun with the crowd singing , Ole , ole , ole , ole . Brasil . Brasil . One woman brought the crowd to its feet as she moved through a samba warm-up . A friend of hers smiled and observed : &quot; In Rio she would be topless , but that would be a little too_much here. &quot; Joked another Brazilian : &quot; There is no word for inhibition in Brazilian Portuguese. &quot; Eli Pereira arrived_at Zabumba laden with instruments . The music and instruments are absolutely necessary because &quot; Brazil ' s soccer team attacks in samba rhythm , &quot; said Pereira , who publishes an investment newsletter and heads a prize-winning samba school in Los Angeles . As the game began , Zabumba was_well into its rhythm , with conga drums , maracas , whistles and cowbells keeping the beat . The restaurant was a sea of green and yellow , not the least of which were the Brazilian flags and messages that Carla Burgos had painted on customers . Her sister Monica sported the name of the restaurant on her exposed midriff and &quot; Brasil &quot; on her back . Hearing the game announcers on Spanish-language television was impossible over the noise , and the crowd broke_into several premature explosive celebrations when they mistakenly thought Brazil had scored . &quot; Sweden is playing Russian roulette , &quot; Pereira said , &quot; and the loaded chamber is next. &quot; The Swedes dodged several bullets before Brazil finally scored the match ' s only goal in the second_half and sparked a celebration at Zabumba that left passersby stunned . As the game wound down to its final minutes , Brazilian fans began singing the traditional song with which they close carnival -- a tune with the same melody as the Mexican folk_song &quot; Cielito Lindo. &quot; The eruption when the game ended showed that everything before had been merely a prelude . Dancers wrapped themselves in Brazilian flags and poured_out to Venice Boulevard , where passing motorists honked their horns_in celebration . The World Cup has brought a stronger identity to the estimated 20 # 000 Brazilians in Southern California , said Rodney Mello , editor and publisher of News from Brazil , a monthly magazine . &quot; I ' ve never seen so many Brazilians in the 14 years I ' ve been here , &quot; he said . As far as the Burgos sisters are concerned , much more is yet to come . For Sunday ' s final with Italy , they ' ve won city permission to close_off a side street . Win or lose , the entire neighborhood will get a chance to see how the Brazilians party .</TEXT>
