   <HEADLINE> WOMEN CAUGHT IN MIDDLE OF BREAST-IMPLANT DEBATE ; HEALTH : RESEARCH INDICATING THAT THE SILICONE-GEL DEVICES ARE MOSTLY SAFE COMES OUT AT SAME TIME AS A TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT FOR THOSE WHO SAY THEY WERE HARMED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While lawyers were busy over the past year hammering_out a billion-dollar legal settlement for women with health_problems possibly due_to silicone-gel breast_implants , doctors were gathering evidence indicating the implants may be safe for most women . Left in the gap between the two warring professions are women who have , or want to get , the implants but are unsure whom to believe . The settlement comes at a time when most doctors are vehement that the implants are generally safe . In the past year , more_than a dozen studies have appeared , seeming to absolve the implants of the most serious charge : silicone leaching from the implant can migrate throughout a woman ' s body and cause a wide range of autoimmune disorders , such_as lupus , scleroderma or rheumatoid_arthritis . In the studies , comparing women with implants to similar-age women without implants , the rate of autoimmune illnesses was equal . The evidence is impressive because it was gathered from large independent studies , says Dr. Jack C . Fisher , president of the California Society of Plastic_Surgeons . And in a heavy-handed statement published in December , leaders of the American Medical Assn . said the group strongly supports continued use of the implants . The public anxiety over the safety of the implants &quot; is not warranted based on current scientific evidence , &quot; wrote the AMA ' s Council on Scientific Affairs in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . But others contend that the recent tentative agreement on a nationwide class-action lawsuit -- which creates a $ 4.75-billion fund to compensate thousands of women who claim they were harmed by the implants -- gives the impression that the manufacturers are admitting liability . Manufacturers say the settlement is not an admission of guilt but simply puts a divisive issue to rest . &quot; A woman would have to be a fool to get silicone breast_implants knowing that the manufacturers have agreed to put_together this pot of money to pay sick women , &quot; says Marie Walsh of the Breast_Implant Information Foundation , Laguna Hills . While the most recent scientific studies indicate that the implants are safe for most women , the settlement may carry a stronger message -- &quot; a message of guilt to the public , &quot; says Fisher . &quot; The average person will conclude that silicone is bad for your health. &quot; The mixed bag of news has left confused a great many of the 1 million to 2 million U.S. women with the implants , which were removed from the market except as part of clinical studies in a 1992 moratorium issued by the Food and Drug Administration . Breast-cancer survivors who desire breast reconstruction are typically baffled by the issue , says Sharon Green , executive_director of the national nonprofit breast_cancer support group Y-ME . &quot; We originally took a stance to keep them on the market , &quot; Green says . &quot; We felt there were problems , but we felt each individual had to determine what their risks were . But these studies , both international and national , are coming in and they are not showing definite ( problems ) . Now that there is a settlement on the table what does that mean ? I don ' t know what to tell anyone anymore. &quot; * Silicone-gel breast_implants have been implicated in several problems , including breakage , painful hardening of the breast and -- the most grave charge -- causing a range of autoimmune disorders . While manufacturers acknowledge the problems of hardening and rupture , the link to autoimmune_diseases is unproven , although hundreds of women with the implants now claim to have developed one or more of the disorders . But the new studies tend to refute any link . A Mayo Clinic study found no higher incidence of the disorders among 824 women with silicone implants compared to 1 # 634 women who did not have implants . In another study at Houston ' s M.D. Anderson Cancer Center , the incidence of autoimmune_disease among 250 breast_cancer patients who received implants was compared with 353 cancer patients who had breast reconstruction using their own tissue . There was no difference in disease rates between the two groups . And , in another strong study , a range of laboratory tests , such_as blood_tests , were performed on 200 women with implants and 100 women of the same age who did not have implants . University of Toronto researchers concluded that there was no evidence that silicone-gel implants were related to autoimmune_disease . The studies have been trumpeted by implant manufacturers . &quot; There is a growing body of valid scientific evidence that shows no link between implants and connective_tissue or autoimmune_disease , &quot; says Dr. Ralph Cook , Dow Corning ' s director of epidemiology . Cook notes that none of these studies was funded by Dow Corning , the largest implant manufacturer . But Walsh isn ' t convinced because the studies haven ' t been conducted over a long enough time_period . Autoimmune disease may_not develop until many years after a woman has received implants , Walsh says . But Fisher , of the California Society of Plastic_Surgeons , notes that the epidemiological studies will continue . &quot; The very best epidemiological inquiry is the Mayo study . It shows absolutely no difference . But it has to be followed for awhile . It ' s going_to take a lot more time -- 10 or 15 years , &quot; he says . * Studies showing no evidence of autoimmune disorders may have come too late to save silicone implants from the medical devices graveyard . The lawsuits and the FDA ' s moratorium on implants , for example , were motivated as much by the other problems , such_as breakage and hardening , as by the possible link to autoimmune_disease , says Jeffrey Steinberger , a Beverly Hills attorney representing 2 # 300 women with implants . &quot; If someone has had seven surgeries , who cares if ( the link to autoimmune_disease ) has been proven ? &quot; he says . &quot; Autoimmune disease isn ' t the whole issue . There are a myriad of other problems. &quot; Indeed , some observers suggest that women will never have all_the answers regarding safety . When the FDA announced its moratorium , the agency said it would allow women to get the implants as part of studies to prove safety . But , it was left up_to manufacturers to undertake the studies and submit data to the FDA . &quot; The FDA ' s decision was to allow the manufacturers to do the studies to prove their safety and effectiveness -- as long as there are manufacturers that want to do that , &quot; says FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan . Silicone-gel implants are now manufactured by only one company , Mentor Corp . of Santa Barbara , which has agreed to stop making the implants as of April , 1995 , as part of its own legal settlement . Mentor ' s implants are only available to mastectomy patients as part of the safety studies . Company officials said that enough women will have received the implants by next year ' s deadline in_order to produce a valid study . In the meantime , saline-filled implants are still available to women for breast augmentation and reconstruction after mastectomy . And , researchers are actively testing peanut-oil-filled implants as a possible safe alternative . But while silicone-gel implants may slink out of existence with little fanfare , safety studies will continue to be of great interest to women with implants , particularly those who are having no problems but wonder whether they should have the implants removed to prevent trouble from developing . Each new report of a potential problem sends shivers through many women . In one of the most alarming studies yet regarding implants , researchers from Schneider Children ' s Hospital in New Hyde Park , N.Y. , suggested that women with silicone-gel implants who breast feed may pass autoimmune problems to their offspring . The controversial paper , published in January in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , examined 11 children born to women with silicone breast_implants . Of the eight who were breast fed , six developed a rare disorder in the lower esophagus that usually only arises from scleroderma , an illness that some women with implants have reported to suffer . While there have been numerous anecdotal reports of children of women with implants also having autoimmune disorders , the study was blasted by many doctors . &quot; The most important question it raises is why the editorial board of that journal would publish a study about 11 children , &quot; says Fisher . &quot; We don ' t know if there was any silicone in the breast milk itself . At least you have to start_out with evidence that the children were exposed to silicone. &quot; Breast_Implants : a Chronology * 1962 : Breast_implants become available . * 1976 : Congress gives the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate medical devices ; devices already on the market are &quot; grandfathered &quot; onto the acceptable list without safety tests . * August , 1991 : FDA warns physicians and the public of potential problems with implants due_to a high number of consumer complaints . * Jan . 6 , 1992 : FDA commissioner David Kessler requests voluntary moratorium on further use of silicone implants until FDA panel can meet to discuss safety . * Spring , 1992 : Several manufacturers , including Dow Corning -- the largest manufacturer -- voluntarily withdraw implants from the market . * April 16 , 1992 : FDA states that proof of safety and effectiveness for silicone-gel implants has not been established by manufacturers and requires new testing . Makes implants available only through controlled safety studies . * Feb . 14 , 1994 : Facing a class-action lawsuit , manufacturers agree to pay $ 4.75 billion to compensate women allegedly harmed by implants . * April , 1995 : Mentor Corp . will cease manufacturing silicone-gel implants , the last manufacturer to do so .</TEXT>
