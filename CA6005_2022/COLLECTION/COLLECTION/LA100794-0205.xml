   <TEXT> Child-Resistant Packaging : The Consumer Product Safety Commission has voted to require child-resistant packaging of non-prescription anesthetics with certain amounts of the drugs dibucaine and lidocaine . Anesthetics containing the drugs are used to treat sunburn and hemorrhoids and are sold as ointments , creams , liquids and sprays . The agency said the medicines have been blamed for 16 deaths over the past 43 years . Poison control_centers also reported more_than 750 cases of children swallowing them in 1992 , the agency said . &quot; Compared with the relatively small number of products containing these substances , the number of yearly ingestions of the medicine make the case for special packaging more compelling , &quot; commission Chairman Ann Brown said . The child-resistant packaging will be required beginning in April , 1996 , for anesthetics containing more_than half a milligram of dibucaine and more_than 5 milligrams of lidocaine .</TEXT>
