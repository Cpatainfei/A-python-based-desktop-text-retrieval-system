   <TEXT> Neither the frigid weather in the eastern part of the nation nor the California earthquake stalled the auto industry ' s momentum in January . Figures released by the auto_makers Thursday show total car and truck sales -- including vehicles built_in the United States and abroad -- were up 14.3 % for the month . January ' s cold typically makes_it a slow month for auto sales , and analysts were expecting worse results because of record low_temperatures . Big Three vehicle sales combined were up 14.8 % for the month , compared to an 11.4 % improvement for Japanese auto_makers and a 24.4 % improvement for European and Korean auto_makers , whose volume is much smaller . &quot; I think these are excellent numbers , considering how bad the weather was , &quot; Salomon Bros . analyst Jack Kirnan said . &quot; We are in the big ' B. ' We are in a boom period. &quot; On a seasonally adjusted basis , domestically built cars sold at an annual rate of 7.3 million , with imported cars accounting_for another 1.8 million . Domestically built light trucks , which include minivans , pickups and sport utility vehicles , sold at a record annual pace of nearly 5.9 million , about 600 # 000 ahead of last January . &quot; Everything is coming_together , &quot; Kirnan said . &quot; Used car prices are staying high , interest_rates are at record lows , massive replacement pressures for cars are continuing and employer and consumer sentiment is strong. &quot; Domestic auto_makers , who lost 71 # 000 units of car and truck production in January due_to the record cold , are moving to make_up for those losses . They have added 111 # 000 cars and trucks to February and March production plans , according to the trade journal Ward ' s Automotive Reports . &quot; Credit the public acceptance of Chrysler ' s products and the continued strength of the economy for the strong month , &quot; said Theodor Cunningham , executive_vice_president of sales and marketing at Chrysler Corp . Chrysler ' s 17.9 % increase in truck sales led to the No . 3 auto_maker ' s strongest January sales in four years . Car sales were up just 1.3 % for an overall improvement of 10.9 % . General Motors Corp . said its truck sales were the best in history . Full-size pickups were up 45 % from last year , leading to 21.9 % higher overall truck sales . Five of six car divisions reported higher sales , contributing to a 13.6 % improvement . Ford Motor Co . had a robust 34 % increase in truck sales but a meager 1.2 % improvement in car sales .</TEXT>
