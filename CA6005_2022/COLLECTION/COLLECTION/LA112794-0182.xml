   <HEADLINE> SLAM THE DOOR ON LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLANS ; THE CITY ' S PROPOSAL TO USE FEDERAL QUAKE RECOVERY FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT SUCH HIGH-DENSITY BUILDINGS COULD LEAD TO MORE CRIME AND URBAN DECAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent vote by the Los Angeles City_Council was an unwelcome reminder that it is way past time for those who represent Van Nuys , North Hollywood , Reseda , Pacoima and Canoga Park to reverse course and oppose additional high-density , low-income housing in these areas . The council voted to link a city earthquake-repair program to more low-income housing . The program , proposed by the city Housing Department , will offer investors in earthquake-damaged apartments low- or no-interest loans , contingent_on adding low-income units to the buildings . The interest_rate will be 3 % if the apartment owner reserves 20 % of the repaired units for low-income housing ; zero interest , if 40 % . This type of housing is usually called affordable housing . A better term would be slum housing , when it is built_in densely populated areas . The council_members representing Northridge and Sherman Oaks objected -- for a time -- to this use of federal aid . &quot; The purpose of this money was to help rebuild buildings , &quot; Councilman Hal Bernson said . &quot; It was not intended for social engineering. &quot; Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky questioned the push for low-income housing units , saying that they might not be appropriate in every reconstruction project . Both councilmen were obviously attempting to protect their earthquake-damaged communities from a city program that appears to be more concerned with creating additional low-income , higher-density housing than repairing earthquake damage . Quake repair , remember , was the intended use of the federal funds . Potentially , parts of Reseda Boulevard near Cal State Northridge and stretches of several streets in Sherman Oaks north of Ventura Boulevard will see modest-sized apartment_houses replaced with large ones . These buildings will bring all_the problems associated with crowding of poor people into a cramped neighborhood . Similar unfortunate results could occur wherever there is damage to apartment_houses throughout the Valley , with no study given to the desirability of imposing big , low-income units on particular neighborhoods . High crime and decaying pride of ownership are among the burdens that high-density , low-income housing places on neighborhoods where it is concentrated . Police records firmly associate law_enforcement problems with such housing projects . Bernson and Yaroslavsky , unfortunately , gave_in to the lure of low-interest loans . By the conclusion of its meeting on Oct . 7 , the council had unanimously approved the program . I believe this to be an absolute misuse of earthquake relief funds . It will encourage more of the type of housing that has led to the decayed and crime-infested neighborhoods that now exist throughout the less affluent communities in Los Angeles . If our elected officials really want to develop a successful affordable housing program , they must work jointly with developers to create housing that does not resemble a stucco prison but instead would instill a sense of community . This can be done much more effectively with detached single-family dwellings . Developers must be given incentives to build smaller two- and three-bedroom single-family tract homes as starter homes , instead of the more common three- and four-bedroom tract homes . We must rebuild in the earthquake-damaged areas of the city now . Creating a low-income housing program merely to replace damaged apartments is not addressing the affordable housing shortage in Los Angeles . Historically , homeowners and not apartment dwellers have displayed the highest degree of pride in their places of residence . This is evident in many of the neighborhoods in Van Nuys , North Hollywood , Reseda , Canoga Park and Pacoima . With the ever increasing population growth in Southern California and Los Angeles County , it is inhumane and insensitive to continue crowding people into one large apartment project after another . Such overcrowding might well be profitable for the landlord , but it has proven to be devastating to existing single-family residential neighborhoods . My solution is not complex , and it would help revive the ailing construction_industry and create jobs , while easing the crowding in existing apartments .</TEXT>
