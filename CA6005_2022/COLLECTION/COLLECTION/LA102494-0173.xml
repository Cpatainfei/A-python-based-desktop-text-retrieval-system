   <HEADLINE> CAPITOL JOURNAL : POLITICIANS LAY_OUT CARDS IN PROP . 187 GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s voters are getting lectures and advice from every political angle and corner of the country on Proposition 187 . They ' re being told it will spread TB , cost the state billions and smacks of Nazi Germany . They ' re also being told that is all hogwash and that 187 is the only way to message Washington they ' re sick_of illegal immigration . The political heavies now have weighed in -- the latest being President Clinton -- and you can tell Washingtonians by their language . They ' re the pundits and politicians who speak_of Californians backing 187 as &quot; nativists. &quot; An example : the surprise joint statement last Wednesday by Washington think tankers William J . Bennett and Jack F . Kemp , who inferred that 187 &quot; would help contribute to a nativist , anti-immigrant climate. &quot; Sen . Dianne Feinstein , for one , began loudly arguing early last year that unless tough steps are taken_to control illegal immigration , there will be a nasty backlash against all immigrants . But on Friday she said one such step should not be 187 . Politicians who had been hiding their Proposition 187 cards suddenly started showing them last week . The question is whether voters were paying much attention and , more precisely , whether it will change their attitudes . The consensus of political strategists I ' ve talked to is that 187 likely will pass , but many voters probably are rethinking their views and the measure may_not carry by as big a margin as polls have indicated . Voters tend to resent lectures from the Establishment , whether it be from politicians , professors , pundits or prominent people in town . But the preaching invariably is heard , if not always heeded . And the opposition will have a lot more money to broadcast its message than will the 187 sponsors . * The card playing started with the &quot; conscience &quot; statement of conservatives Bennett , the former education_secretary , and Kemp , the ex-housing secretary who is plotting a presidential race . Theirs was a wild card because it came_out of nowhere and put them in conflict with many Republican allies . They argued , among other things , that the 187 provision requiring school and health officials to report people they &quot; reasonably suspect &quot; of being illegal immigrants is &quot; a highly intrusive Big Brother approach &quot; and &quot; profoundly anti-conservative. &quot; But while condemning candidates who back 187 for &quot; political advantage , &quot; they also offered political advice : The GOP shouldn ' t be seen as &quot; turning_away immigrants . . . Asians , Hispanics and others &quot; or it could pay a long-term &quot; political cost. &quot; Turning_away illegal immigrants ostensibly is every politician ' s goal , whether they ' re for or against 187 . But politicians think politically . And the real goal for most is attractive posturing and / or survival in the face of strong public pressure . Kemp , however , was &quot; speaking from the heart , &quot; advisers say . Whatever , he undoubtedly hurt himself with party activists who are pushing 187 . The Los Angeles native has been banking on a victory in the 1996 California primary to win the GOP presidential nomination . Commented Gov . Pete Wilson of Kemp and Bennett : &quot; When you spend too_much time in an ivory_tower think_tank , you begin to lose touch with reality . . . . They ' re wrong because they have failed to make the distinction between legal and illegal immigration. &quot; Wilson intends to do just that in a new TV ad starting today . It will say there ' s a right way and a wrong way to immigrate ; people should play by the rules . Opponents of 187 , of course , argue the measure does nothing to control the border , and it ' s foolish and mean-spirited to deny public schooling and health_care to illegal immigrants . Backers contend these services are incentives and , in any case , it ' s unfair to force taxpayers to provide benefits for people who do slip into the country illegally . * After Kemp and Bennett announced their opposition , Rep . Mike Huffington immediately curried the favor of 187 backers by declaring his support . He also jabbed at Feinstein for not taking a stand . The next day , Feinstein came_out against 187 , noting this could cost her the election . An early crusader against illegal immigration , she nevertheless found 187 offensive . But she delayed her announcement for weeks to reduce the time Huffington would have to attack her position in TV ads . Meanwhile , Vice_President Al Gore and , then , President Clinton proclaimed their opposition . So did several California corporate heads and hundreds of striking Pacoima middle_school students . Commentator Patrick J . Buchanan endorsed it . For politicians , this is political . But for regular people , it ' s very personal . Many may_not decide their vote until they enter the quiet privacy of a ballot booth .</TEXT>
