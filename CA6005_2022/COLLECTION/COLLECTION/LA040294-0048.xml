   <HEADLINE> TURMOIL FOR INVESTORS ; BONDS TUMBLE ; STOCK_MARKET BRACES FOR A HECTIC MONDAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New evidence that a powerful economic expansion is underway sent bond prices tumbling Friday and heightened fears that the stock_market decline might accelerate next week . Monthly employment figures released Friday were far stronger than expected , prompting renewed concern about inflation . That in turn caused a dramatic sell-off in the bond market , with 30-year U.S. Treasury_bond prices tumbling as much as $ 20 per $ 1 # 000 bond and yields climbing as high as 7.28 % before closing at 7.26 % . Stock_exchanges were closed for Good_Friday , forestalling immediate reaction to the news by equity investors . In light currency trading , the dollar rose against all_the major world currencies on the economy ' s strength , closing at 103.60 yen in New York , up from 102.60 late Thursday . But stocks were pummeled all week in very heavy trading , and the job figures combined with the bond market reaction could put new downward pressure on share prices when trading resumes Monday . Indeed , brokerage_houses and mutual_fund companies were bracing for a tumultuous day Monday . Mutual_fund leader Fidelity Investments , for example , said it had additional staff on_hand over the last week and will keep them in place to cope_with a possible flood of activity Monday . &quot; Wall_Street was very late to recognize the strength of the economy , &quot; said David Hale , chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago . &quot; It will be a bad Monday. &quot; The Dow Jones industrial average lost 138 points during the week , though it closed_up 9 Thursday after a roller_coaster day that saw the market down 65 points in early trading . With the Federal_Reserve expected to push interest_rates up once again in response to the strong economic news , most market watchers expect further declines . Still , Hale and other analysts cautioned that Friday ' s bond market drop may have been an overreaction . Trading was very_light as a result of the holiday ; bond markets are typically closed on Good_Friday , but with the market tumult , many dealers opened for an abbreviated trading day that ended at 11:00 a.m. in New York . &quot; The ( job ) figures aren ' t really as strong as they look_on the surface , so maybe after some thought_over the weekend the markets might not react quite as strongly , &quot; said Lyle Gramley , a former Federal_Reserve_Board governor and now consulting economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn . Interest_rates are not the only thing putting pressure on stock prices . Hale noted that politics are in flux in nearly all_the major industrial countries -- not to mention trouble spots like Mexico and Korea . In addition , many large investment pools known as hedge_funds have sustained enormous losses in bond_trading and are being forced to liquidate holdings , further depressing prices . There remains little consensus , however , on whether the current stock slide is merely a &quot; correction &quot; that will soon end or the beginning of a long bear_market . And many traders are waiting anxiously to see whether the new mutual_fund customers who have been drawn to a bullish stock_market over the past year will now head for the exits . Selected Interest_Rates : Averages of daily rates ended Thursday , in percent : Corporate AAA bonds 7.61 % , 90-day CDs 3.80 % , 3-month Treasury_bills 3.50 % , Bank prime rate , 6.25 % , Municipal_bonds 5.92 % , Federal funds rate 3.49 % , Discount rate 3.00 % Source : Federal_Reserve_Board</TEXT>
