   <HEADLINE> COUNTY IS SAFEST URBAN AREA IN THE WEST ; STATISTICS : A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN OXNARD CRIME_RATE PROPELS REGION BACK TO THE TOP . AUTHORITIES CREDIT CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County reclaimed its title as the safest urban_area in the West in 1993 after nearly a 10 % drop_in serious crime , according to figures released Monday by the FBI . The county ' s relatively low crime_rate was pushed_down by a dramatic drop_in crime in Oxnard -- the county ' s largest and most crime-ridden city -- and by Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks posting statistics as two of the safest cities of their size in the nation . For the previous two years , Provo , Utah , had displaced the county as the safest urban_area among the 13 western states . Crime fell_in Provo in 1993 , but not as fast as it did_in Ventura County . Ventura County reported 38.8 crimes per 1 # 000 residents , a 9.7 % drop from the 1992 rate of 43 crimes per 1 # 000 people , according to the FBI ' s long-delayed Uniform Crime Reports . Provo posted a rate of 40.7 crimes per 1 # 000 residents , falling_behind the county and other safe western metropolitan areas of Fort Collins , Colo. , San Luis Obispo County , and Bremerton , Wash . &quot; We were very successful last year , &quot; said Oxnard Police_Chief Harold L . Hurtt , pointing_out his city ' s 13.7 % drop_in crime . He attributed the crime reduction to the $ 1 million added_to the city ' s police budget , the enforced ban on cruising on Oxnard Boulevard , new storefront stations in crime-troubled areas and citizens organizing their own neighborhood patrols . &quot; People were frustrated with the crime problem and they have taken an active part in our prevention efforts , &quot; Hurtt said . Ventura County ' s rate of serious crime -- violence such_as rape , robbery and murder , along with burglaries and theft -- was more_than one-third lower than California ' s and more_than one-fourth below the nationwide norm . Ventura County ' s crime_rate was also far lower than that of any large Southern California county , roughly 45 % lower than the rate in Los Angeles and 18 % lower than that in Santa Barbara County . &quot; that ' s why I live here , &quot; said Ventura County Undersheriff Richard S . Bryce . The Sheriff ' s Department handles police matters for five of the county ' s 10 cities and all_of the unincorporated areas in the county . Bryce said Ventura County has been able to maintain a reputation as a strong law-and-order community , particularly with some would-be criminals . &quot; I think that has helped more crime from infiltrating from Los Angeles. &quot; He also said that law_enforcement agencies work well with each other and with members of the public to deter crime and capture criminals . &quot; As much as I ' d like to take credit , it still comes_back to the kind of people we have as neighbors , &quot; Bryce said . * Simi Valley Police_Chief Willard R . Schlieter , who joined the Simi Valley department earlier this year , said he too has noticed an exceptional willingness by residents to get involved . And that has helped his officers control crime spilling over the Los Angeles County_line . &quot; In some cities , people hear gunshots and smashing of glass and they won ' t bother calling the cops , &quot; Schlieter said . But Simi Valley residents are very attentive and helpful , he said . &quot; We wind_up arresting people in stolen vehicles as they are trying to leave our city . We get the information that fast. &quot; The FBI reported Ventura County ' s violent crimes of murder , rape and assault dropped from 3 # 799 in 1992 to 3 # 471 in 1993 , a decline of 8.6 % . Property crimes of burglary , theft and car theft fell from 26 # 045 in 1992 to 23 # 466 in 1993 , a 9.9 % decline . Nationwide , Ventura County is less of a standout when it comes_to comparing low crime_rates in the Northeast , Midwest and South . The county ranked 48th out of the nation ' s 272 Metropolitan Statistical Areas measured in the 1993 Unformed Crime Reports . The FBI annual crime report defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas as an urbanized area that has a central_city or a cluster of communities with economic and social ties and at least 50 # 000 people . Nearly 80 % of the U.S. population is located in these statistical areas . Johnstown , a two-county community of 241 # 800 people in western Pennsylvania , kept its title as the safest metropolitan area in the country with a mere 15.6 crimes per 1 # 000 residents . At the other end of the scale , Miami and surrounding Dade County in Florida held onto the dubious distinction as having the highest rate , 135 crimes per 1 # 000 people .
