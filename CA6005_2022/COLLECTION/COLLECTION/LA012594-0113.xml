   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE MAY SLOW SLUGGISH SOUTHLAND RECOVERY ; ECONOMY : LESS O.C. JOB GROWTH IS FORECAST , BUT COST OF REPAIRS IS NOT LIKELY TO PLUNGE THE REGION BACK INTO RECESSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern California ' s sluggish economic recovery will be even slower this year as earthquake recovery takes precedence . But as steep is it may be , the cost of recuperating from the Jan . 17 Northridge quake is not likely to drive Southern California back into a recession , according to area economists . Economists said employment growth that had been predicted in Orange County this year is likely to flatten_out a bit -- perhaps a net gain of only 1 # 500 jobs instead of the 2 # 200 previously forecast by economists at Chapman University in Orange . Los Angeles County sustained most of the quake damage and that has resulted in predictions of big increases in construction spending and employment . But Los Angeles , which was faring worse than Orange County even before the earth moved , should still lose about 30 # 000 jobs this year . The post-quake difference , economists said , is that there will be less trauma in the construction_industry and more in retailing , services and manufacturing . The earthquake -- and the flood of speculation about how soon it will be until the long-awaited &quot; Big One &quot; hits -- also is likely to speed_up the manufacturing industry ' s exodus from Southern California . But even that should not be enough to knock the region back into a full recession . &quot; Last week I would have been much more inclined to say we were looking_at a significant economic setback , &quot; said Bruce DeVine , chief economist for the Southern California Assn . of Governments . &quot; But the key is the transportation_system , and it is starting to look_like they ' ll have much of it operating in a week or two. &quot; The region will suffer from &quot; the very expensive replacement of fixed assets , a lot of which won ' t be covered by insurance or government , but at least there won ' t be an ongoing , daily shock to the economy because people simply can ' t get_to places they need to go , &quot; he said . &quot; If there was a recovery coming , this probably won ' t slow it down too much. &quot; Esmael Adibi , director of Chapman University ' s Center for Economic Research , estimated quake-related damage to structures and building contents at $ 7.8 billion but said insurance and government programs should pay_for about half of that . In addition , Chapman economists last week estimated that the earthquake will throw a chill on Southland tourism for the rest of the year -- resulting in a loss of as much as $ 4.6 billion from reduced spending . But Los Angeles County alone has an annual economy of $ 300 billion or more , and Orange County ' s annual economic output is about $ 70 billion . The $ 8 billion or so in uncovered losses , Adibi said , amounts to just 2.7 % of the total regional economy . The costs of digging out and rebuilding &quot; will have a major impact , &quot; said Anil Puri , dean of the economics_department at Cal State Fullerton . &quot; We had seen some good signs of real growth in Southern California , and signs that business ' s attitude was becoming more optimistic , and this will hurt . . . but not enough to keep us in recession. &quot; For Puri and other economists , the long-term question is what impact the quake will have_on business decisions to move_out of the area -- or to stay out if they were considering relocating to Southern California . Most experts , however , subscribe_to the theory that business relocation decisions are made_for other , more tangible reasons . &quot; They look_for market , transportation , the availability of trained employees , tax_benefits and things like that , &quot; said Adibi . If companies evacuated a place every time there was a natural disaster , the economists say , then Florida and much of the Midwest would be vacant . Hurricanes , tornadoes , sub-zero winters and massive flooding don ' t permanently damage those regions ' economies , and the Northridge quake isn ' t likely to spawn a major exodus from Southern California . Jim Renzas , executive_vice_president of Paragon Decision Resources Inc. , an Irvine-based business relocation consulting company , said that there was a short-term movement out of the San Francisco area immediately after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 . &quot; But there has been absolutely no major change in the business base there. &quot; Companies most likely to move are companies already considering it -- heavy industry and other businesses with large , relatively low-paid labor_forces that are having problems remaining competitive in California , he said . &quot; In 1990 , a year after Loma Prieta , there was a significant blip in San Francisco companies opening branches or , in some cases , relocating entirely , to Sacramento and Reno , &quot; Renzas said . &quot; And I ' d expect next year to see a blip of Southern California companies relocating to Phoenix and Las Vegas and probably some California areas outside the greater L.A. basin. &quot; But tracking those movements back to the earthquake is impossible , he said , &quot; because nobody , but nobody would ever admit that ' s why they moved . It doesn ' t play well from a publicity standpoint , so there always will be some_other reason ( given for why ) they moved. &quot; Renzas said he would not be doing his job if he didn ' t caution clients about the threat of a bigger earthquake hitting Southern California sometime in the next 30 to 40 years , but he still remains bullish on the region . &quot; The smaller , younger , ' knowledge ' industries in technology , software and biotech are what carry the economy and they are very unlikely to relocate , &quot; Renzas said . &quot; They need to be where the employment and knowledge_base is at , and that ' s here. &quot;</TEXT>
