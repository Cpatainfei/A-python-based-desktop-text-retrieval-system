   <HEADLINE> CLINTON : YET ANOTHER SCANDAL-PLAGUED PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Make no mistake : Whitewater is about a lot more_than possible small-time financial chicanery and a minor-league Washington cover-up . We are talking_about control of the presidency in 1996 or earlier -- and the only thing that matches conservative and Republican political opportunism is liberal and Democratic hypocrisy . GOP stalwarts , uninterested in getting_to the bottom of Watergate or Iran-Contra , are now suffused with patriotism in pursuing Whitewater and the other allegations about Bill_Clinton . Conversely , there are too many congressional Democrats , once outraged over the immorality of earlier GOP regimes , whose past insistence on the public ' s right to know has become acquiescence in this Administration ' s desire to have the public not know . No one should be surprised . This is human nature . It is also political history -- and given the inadequate attention paid to such precedents in the television age , it may be useful to examine Whitewater and other Clinton controversies in the perspective of past political scandals . To begin with , Whitewater -- the land deal , with its related savings-and-loan chicanery -- isn ' t enough to bring_down Clinton . Even Watergate was less a single event than a catchall . When Richard M . Nixon was forced_out of office in 1974 , the anti-Nixon furor fed_on a wide range of issues beyond the break-in : the Nixon Administration ' s larger involvement in political espionage , the Daniel Ellsberg break-in , the ITT scandal and others . The scandal furor of 1973-74 was also a showdown over which party would pay_for the failure in Vietnam -- the Democrats who fumbled militarily or the GOP who used it as a cover_for violating civil_liberties . However , if Clinton won ' t be brought_down by any single episode , it is possible to see the outline of a larger GOP indictment -- a contention that Whitewater is but one facet of a flawed Clinton morality that began with draft evasion 25 years ago ; then broadened with shady financial deals in 1970s and 1980s Arkansas ; took further shape with Gennifer Flowers , and may now involve a Washington abuse of power and cover-up . For the President is America ' s chief_of_state as well as the leader of a political_party , and he is at risk if he can ' t measure_up to a moral-leadership role . Nixon couldn ' t and was forced to resign ; Lyndon B . Johnson , a well-known financial and political finagler , may have been investigated and ejected in the post-Watergate climate ; Clinton may be vulnerable today . Clinton is certainly not the first financial hustler in the White_House . Other modern Presidents have been touched by scandal . The point is that , one way or another , most of them -- Warren G . Harding , Harry S . Truman , Johnson , Nixon and Bush -- were made to leave . If Clinton fits the scandal-President pattern , these precedents should be discomforting . Indeed , polls show that from the first , many Americans did not trust Clinton because of his draft-board maneuvers , the charges made by Flowers and his Arkansas wheeler-dealer roots . This poses the question : Isn ' t Clinton ' s behavior typical of small-state governors who get_to the White_House ? No -- because past governors of the smallest states haven ' t gotten there . Not ever . Jimmy_Carter of Georgia was actually from one of America ' s relatively large states . Ironically , the 20th-Century Presidents tied to the most scandal came from a high-powered background : Four were U.S. senators from major states ( Harding of Ohio , Truman of Missouri , Nixon of California and Johnson of Texas ) and three of them had served as vice_president . Harding died before he could be blamed for the infamous Teapot Dome scandal . Truman brought Kansas City cronyism to the White_House . And Johnson traded on favoritism to build a multimillion-dollar communications business while in Congress . Still another President linked to scandal , Bush , had earlier been vice_president and CIA director . If there is a scandal precedent , it should be not to promote vice_presidents or former vice_presidents . But a second moral might be : Perhaps Americans made a mistake in ignoring the old rule , true since Franklin_Pierce in 1852 , of not picking a President from one of the smallest states . The rule has two components : Small-state nominees often represented the ideological fringe : Barry M . Goldwater of Arizona , in 1964 , and George S . McGovern of South_Dakota , in 1972 , are two examples . The second problem is that small-state politics often develop out of a small-time climate , where the practices leave something to be desired . Americans already had some of these doubts about Clinton even as they elected him in 1992 to be done with Bush . Looking ahead , it ' s unclear if the whole surfeit of Arkansas-hustler accusations made against the Clintons -- from sweetheart commodities deals to shredded financial records , obstruction of justice and sexual_harassment -- can ever reach critical mass and make Clinton an Ozark Elmer Gantry , unacceptable to Americans . But the argument against electing another small-state governor is already substantial . Even if some accusations against Clinton get partly proved , the public has many types of recourse . Only one is legal ; most are political . Because so many allegations involve behavior in Arkansas rather than Washington , Clinton is unique -- compared with the other scandal-plagued Presidents -- in having his controversies emerge early enough for his first midterm elections . Truman ' s mink_coat , deep-freeze and five-percenter messes and Nixon ' s Watergate didn ' t surface until the second midterms ( 1950 and 1974 , respectively ) . The importance of 1994 ' s scandals coming_in time for the first midterms is obvious : Instead of the usual small gains made by the party out of power , the GOP has a larger opportunity . They could wind_up gaining three to four Senate seats and 20 or so House seats -- enough to stalemate Clinton and his programs in Congress during 1995-96 . True , the Republicans could be at risk if they overplay Whitewater , but their broader accusations against Clinton are probably good politics . The earlier Truman and Nixon scandals produced major opposition gains in the midterms . For all that it ' s implausible today , any emerging impeachment debate would be significant . Of the two Presidents against whom impeachment has been sought since the Republican-Democratic era began , Andrew_Johnson in 1867 and then Nixon , both confrontations were brought by an opposition Congress . Johnson , remember , was a Unionist Democrat picked by Republican Abraham_Lincoln as his running mate in 1864 . After Lincoln was shot , hard-line congressional Republicans , eager to get_rid_of Johnson , settled_on impeachment . And , of course , when Nixon was impeached , opposition Democrats were carrying the banner . No President has ever been impeached by his own party . If the unseating of Clinton , far-fetched now , should become a serious issue , it could be devastating for Democrats -- and possibly cost them control of Congress for the first time since 1953-54 . However , the most likely political effect of the charges circling the President is to hurt the Democrats slightly this November and to hurt Clinton more if and when he seeks a second term in 1996 . If some of the allegations against the President gain credence , he might not run_for reelection , and the chances of strong opposition in the primaries would grow . Indeed , of the four Democratic Presidents before Clinton , all but the assassinated John F . Kennedy faced tough primary challenges to their renomination . Weak New Hampshire showings forced Truman and Johnson to retire in 1952 and 1968 , and Carter , after surviving a primary challenge , was ultimately defeated in November , 1980 . Even the stock_market and the economy could be affected by a major political scandal -- especially one that generates impeachment talk . The 1994 stock_market is already in a nose-dive -- with politics part of the explanation . It ' s worth remembering that back in 1973-74 , as the embattled Nixon Administration fought impeachment , its impaired management of the economy overlapped with a major recession and the biggest bear_market since World_War_II . Were a comparable financial crisis and economic slowdown to develop in 1994-95 , this could cost Clinton the White_House two years from now . Controversies now embroiling Clinton may seem unique . But the politics of scandal are a familiar tale in U.S. history . While some lessons are encouraging and some aren ' t , they ' re all worth keeping_in mind as the various accusations and stories play_out .</TEXT>
