   <HEADLINE> WESTINGHOUSE TO CUT 6 # 000 JOBS , DIVIDEND ; EARNINGS : ' 93 NET IS EXPECTED TO FALL 10 % TO 20 % FROM PREVIOUS YEAR . CONGLOMERATE WILL TAKE A $ 750-MILLION CHARGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Westinghouse Electric Corp. , in an effort to strengthen its business , said Tuesday that it will slash its work_force by 6 # 000 during the next two years , take a $ 750-million charge and halve its annual dividend . The conglomerate also said it is going_ahead with plans first announced in November , 1992 , to sell Westinghouse Communities , a builder of retirement homes ; Westinghouse Electric Supply Co. , and its distribution and control units . However , the company said it is canceling a previously announced plan to sell its Knoll furniture unit , saying a new management team is expected to strengthen the business . &quot; We are taking these actions to improve our operating performance , accelerate the divestiture of non-core businesses , rebuild our equity base and improve financial flexibility , &quot; said Michael Jordan , Westinghouse ' s chairman and chief_executive . &quot; This will enable us to grow our core businesses and emerge a stronger international competitor in our key markets , &quot; Jordan said . The badly damaged conglomerate said the actions came too late to help 1993 operating earnings , which are expected to decline 10 % to 20 % from 1992 . Jordan attributed much of the decline to deterioration in the company ' s environmental services business . &quot; This was a major disaster in 1993 , &quot; he said . But in his first meeting with industry_analysts since taking the reins of Westinghouse in June , Jordan vowed to meet internal growth goals of 10 % to 12 % and to modernize the company ' s outdated corporate culture . &quot; I believe our core businesses are sound . . . . We can grow these businesses and grow the cash flow , &quot; he said . Since being named Westinghouse ' s chief_executive , Jordan has carried_out a top-to-bottom review of the company , whose divisions are involved in broadcasting , power generation , hazardous-waste services and the manufacture of electric products and military gear . Jordan , who was recruited from Pepsico , said he hopes the latest restructuring will be the company ' s last . &quot; I firmly believe there shouldn ' t be another one , &quot; Jordan told the large roomful of analysts during a two-hour presentation at a Manhattan hotel . Westinghouse ' s stock ended off 12.5 cents at $ 14 on the New York Stock_Exchange , as Wall_Street reckoned that the company still faces major problems . Westinghouse said the $ 750-million , fourth-quarter charge will include $ 350 million to cover companywide layoffs of 3 # 400 employees in the next two years . The company said the cuts , coupled with attrition , are expected to result in a work_force reduction of 6 # 000 . It employs nearly 55 # 000 people worldwide . The charge includes $ 215 million for divesting and restructuring non-core businesses and $ 185 million to help resolve various legal disputes , the company said . Westinghouse also said it will cut its annual dividend on common shares to 20 cents a share from 40 cents . Wall_Street analysts said the company ' s financial_condition has limited its ability to make more changes . &quot; I would have preferred if they had gone_further , &quot; one analyst said . &quot; I ' ve got the gnawing sensation that they wanted to do more but couldn ' t risk their balance sheet. &quot; Analysts also said the plan may_not be enough to revive the giant conglomerate . They cited the company ' s failure to take aggressive steps to stabilize its future , such_as appointing a chief financial_officer . Chief Financial Officer Warren Hollinshead announced in September that he would relinquish his post to prepare_for early retirement .</TEXT>
