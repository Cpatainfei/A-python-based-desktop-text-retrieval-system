   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; IT ' S A ROMANIAN HOLIDAY FOR SWITZERLAND ; GROUP_A : SWISS CELEBRATE A 4-1 VICTORY , THEIR FIRST CUP TRIUMPH IN 40 YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What Hex ? What Hagi ? What heat ? Wednesday afternoon , Switzerland overcame all obstacles as it blew Romania ' s cover and the lid off the Silverdome , scoring three second-half goals en route to a 4-1 victory before 61 # 428 . The win sent angst-ridden Swiss fans screaming into the streets of Pontiac and Zurich , this time not having to wave their red flags in surrender . Switzerland , with its back against the Matterhorn in Group_A , dominated play after intermission to secure its first World Cup victory since 1954 . That triumph , exactly 40 years ago today , was a 4-1 victory over Italy . After taking its share of criticism at_home in the wake of its 1-1 tie with the United States , Switzerland came_out kicking against Romania . The first_half was hard fought , a dead-heat . A 1-1 tie . The second_half was all Swiss . The deciding goal came_in the 53rd minute , after Alain Sutter ' s corner_kick from the right side disappeared into a maze of players in front of the goal . Television replays revealed the ball then struck the hand of a Swiss player , an infraction , but the play went unnoticed by the referee . The ball was slapped forward into an open space to the left of goal , allowing striker Stephane Chapuisat to sneak a sliding shot to the right of Romanian goalkeeper , Bogdan Stelea . What controversy the hand ball might have caused in a close contest proved moot in the 66th minute , when Swiss midfielder Ciriaco Sforza took_off on a brilliant , open-field run_down the right sideline . He then split two defenders with a pass to himself , and crossed the ball left to a streaking Adrian Knup , who easily converted for a goal to make_it 3-1 . For good measure , the_Swiss added another gift goal in the 72nd minute . Georges Bregy was credited with a grazing header , though it appeared a Romanian might actually have touched the ball last . The Swiss used the remainder of the game to take curtain_calls . Sutter , who scored Switzerland ' s first goal , asked that he and his flowing golden locks be removed from the game . Wish granted , he limped gallantly out of the stadium on a sore ankle , slapping hands with fans along the way . &quot; I am happy for the_Swiss people , &quot; Switzerland Coach Roy Hodgson , an Englishman , said . &quot; After a 40-year wait , they have a chance to celebrate a Swiss victory in the World Cup. &quot; Hodgson now fears expectations will soar . &quot; There ' s an old Swedish saying , that no tree grows to heaven , &quot; Hodgson said . &quot; But that ' s not true in the sports worlds . In the sporting world , trees are expected to grow to heaven. &quot; Wednesday , the branches of Tree Switzerland stretched skyward . With one first-round game remaining , against Columbia , Hodgson believes his team ' s chances for advancement are secured . Although he disagreed_with those who criticized his first-game tactic of employing only one striker , the_Swiss returned to a two-forward attack with Chapuisat and Knup , with obvious results . And what of the Romanians ? They were tournament darlings after upsetting Colombia in their opener but turned ugly under the dome . Romania was hit with three yellow cards for hard fouls , and another player , Ion Vladoiu , was ejected with a second-half red card for his cleating of Swiss midfielder Christophe Ohrel . Later , it was the Romanians who cried foul , complaining about World Cup scheduling and weather_conditions . By most accounts , the heat and humidity in no way approached the sauna conditions that existed last Saturday . Still , Romania wilted like , well , warm romaine . Gheorghe Hagi , the team ' s star playmaker , gave it his all . . . for a half . He scored his team ' s lone goal in the 36th minute but was largely a non-factor thereafter . &quot; I played well in the first_half , &quot; Hagi said . &quot; But in the second_half , because of a lack of oxygen , my body could not keep_up . My legs were cramping up . Everybody that plays here will face this. &quot; Switzerland included . Anghel Iordanescu , the Romanian coach , complained his team was at a jet-lag disadvantage , having played its opener in Los Angeles , while Switzerland played its first two games at the same venue . Asked if he was going_to make lineup changes for Romania ' s upcoming game against the United States , Iordanescu worked in a not-so-subtle dig . &quot; we ' ll have to turn our watches back three hours , go_back to L.A. , then take into consideration the health of my players , &quot; he said . &quot; Then I will make my final decision. &quot; It might well be .</TEXT>
