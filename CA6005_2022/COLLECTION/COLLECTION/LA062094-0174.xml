   <HEADLINE> DUST NEAR STARS SAID TO BE PRECURSOR OF PLANETS ; ASTRONOMY : HUBBLE TELESCOPE REVEALS HUGE DISKS OF MATERIAL AROUND YOUNG SUNS . THE MATTER WILL EVENTUALLY CONDENSE INTO SPHERES , SCIENTISTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The repaired Hubble Space Telescope has given astronomers their clearest look yet at the process of planetary formation around other stars , scientists said last week . Observing 110 young stars in the Orion Nebula , a great cloud of interstellar gas 1 # 500 light_years from Earth , astronomer C . Robert O ' Dell of Rice University in Houston found that more_than half were surrounded by mammoth disks of dust that researchers believe will eventually condense into planets . The discovery is &quot; strong proof &quot; that the so-called protoplanetary disks , and hence planets themselves , are &quot; a common product of star formation , &quot; O ' Dell said at a NASA news_conference in Washington . The observations confirm indirect_evidence that planets , and thus life itself , are not unique to our own solar_system , but are ubiquitous throughout the universe . &quot; This is one more ( piece of ) the argument &quot; that life exists elsewhere , O ' Dell said . And unlike the recent discovery of three planets circling an unusual star called a pulsar , the new observations involve stars much more similar to our own sun and should lend insight into the genesis of the Earth and its neighbors , O ' Dell said . &quot; We have a lot to learn about the formation of our solar_system by watching these ( protoplanetary disks ) , &quot; said astronomer Anne L . Kinney of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore . The search for evidence of planets and planetary formation outside our solar_system has long been a preoccupation of astronomers , many of whom refuse to believe that humans are alone in the universe . Mathematical formulations indicate that if there are a lot of planets , then the probability of life existing independently of Earth is also high . That quest has been extremely difficult because planets are so small and dim . Planets the size of those in our solar_system could not be seen by the Hubble telescope even if they were circling the nearest star , only four light_years away , according to astronomer Suzan Edwards of Smith College in Northampton , Mass . But if those same planets were ground up into small pieces and scattered through an area the size of our solar_system or larger , they would form a cloud that would be a lot easier to spot , said astronomer Stephen P . Maran of NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . And with its newly repaired optics , in fact , the Hubble did spot such protoplanetary disks in the first place it looked , the stellar nursery called the Orion Nebula . Less than 1 million years old , the nebula is a seething mass of hot gases that are condensing into stars much like our own . The density of matter in the nebula is about 100 # 000 times the density in the region of our solar_system . Conventional theory suggests that when a clump of gas and dust coalesces under the force of gravity to form a star , from 1 % to 10 % of the original material is left_behind and accumulates in a disk around the star , Edwards said . Eventually , gravity also causes matter in the disks to coalesce into planets . O ' Dell originally observed the disks with the Hubble two years ago , before the telescope was repaired . But the resolution was so poor because of the instrument ' s faulty optics that it was impossible to tell whether he was observing disks or shells of dust that were unlikely to coalesce into planets . Now , since the repair , the resolution of the telescope is twice as good , enabling him and his colleagues to see that they are in fact disks . Furthermore , the increased resolution enabled them to estimate the mass and density of the disks . They found that the mass of the outer edge of the disks , for example , was large enough to make seven to 10 Earths . O ' Dell said that it is virtually certain that he is watching planetary formation . &quot; There is no possible alternative explanation for the observations , &quot; he said . &quot; Once you ' ve seen them ( the disks ) , this has got_to be what it is. &quot;</TEXT>
