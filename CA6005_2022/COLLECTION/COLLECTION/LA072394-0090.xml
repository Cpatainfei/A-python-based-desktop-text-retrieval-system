   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS SQUABBLE OVER ROCK NAMED SPOCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A cat . A Vulcan . And an asteroid . Mix them together and you have a controversy of cosmic proportions that has been brewing for nearly a decade around James Gibson , a planetary scientist from Tujunga . Gibson is the target of scientific ire because he named an asteroid after his late cat , Mr. Spock . &quot; We knew that there would probably be some flak for it , but we didn ' t expect it to go this far , &quot; said Gibson , 66 , who chose the name in 1985 with the help of his wife . Remarkably , Gibson ' s choice is still the lightning_rod for the question of how liberal astronomers should be in naming their discoveries . With more_than 300 asteroids named every year , scientists are running_out of names , and turning_to those of political_dissidents , musicians and even mistresses . That has irritated some members of the international astronomy group that registers such names , setting_off a debate in the letters columns of astronomy journals . Hitler can ' t get one named after him until 2045 ( there is a century-long moratorium from the time of death on naming asteroids after military or political figures ) , but otherwise there are few restrictions : There ' s Asteroid 564 , named Dudu , and Asteroids 4147 to 4150 , named after the four Beatles . Nevertheless , Gibson ' s decision to name Asteroid 2309 after his marble gray tabby , who kept him company at an isolated mountaintop observatory in Argentina , was apparently the last straw . In response to his action , a review panel at the International Astronomical Union in 1985 passed a resolution discouraging such pet names . Ever since , Gibson ' s cat has surfaced periodically in the written debates of scientific journals as an example of bad taste ; some scientists expect the issue to come hurtling back into view next month in the_Netherlands at the meeting of the astronomical union , which convenes every three years . The rules that now regulate such names are &quot; not entirely satisfactory , &quot; concedes Brian Marsden , who serves on the IAU ' s Minor_Planet Names Committee . &quot; It can get silly . But you have to have a sense_of_humor in this business. &quot; Marsden , putting that philosophy into practice , supported the application to name 2309 for Spock the cat . Tom Gehrels , a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona who coordinates the Spacewatch search for asteroids that may collide_with the Earth , is anti-Spock , saying Gibson &quot; has hurt ( astronomy ) enough that the committee will not allow it to happen again. &quot; Scientists believe most asteroids are rocky space chunks ranging from the size of a house to the size of a small city -- cosmic debris left over from the solar_system ' s formation 4.5 billion years ago . Asteroids are first given numbers upon their discovery . After their orbits have been confirmed in subsequent sightings by other astronomers , the discoverer has 10 years to assign a name , Marsden said . As of Friday , 6 # 057 asteroids had been discovered hurtling through the solar_system , about 4 # 600 of which have been named , said Marsden , who also serves as director of the Minor_Planet Center in Cambridge , Mass . The names are registered by being published in the Minor_Planets Circulars edited at the center . Marsden said obvious names like Copernicus , Galileo and those of other famous astronomers have already been taken . &quot; It does make things rather difficult when it comes_to naming things , &quot; Marsden said . Gibson is happy with the debate . An astronomer for 36 years who previously named asteroids after his wife , Ursula , and his hometown of Ellensburg , Wash. , Gibson submitted Spock in part to reaffirm that asteroids should be named after those who have made helpful , significant or unusual contributions to astronomy . His late cat qualifies , he said , but some_other personal choices do not . &quot; I don ' t have a problem with people who name objects after the seven astronauts who went_down in Challenger , &quot; Gibson said . &quot; But to name an asteroid for a granddaughter who isn ' t out of the crib yet , that ' s a little extreme. &quot; Mr. Spock -- so named in part because his pointy ears resembled those of the &quot; Star Trek &quot; TV series Vulcan -- deserves to be immortalized in the heavens for his services to astronomy by keeping Gibson company on his lonely work of watching the sky , the scientist figures . The tabby was often Gibson ' s only companion on moonlit walks to the lonely observatory in Argentina where he worked from 1971 to 1974 . It was in that observatory that he discovered Asteroid 2309 in 1971 , which he would name after Mr. Spock in 1985 . &quot; He was a great cat , &quot; said Gibson , recalling the nights when the friendly feline would spend hours outside the observatory dome waiting for him , or entertain the couple in their home . &quot; He had done more for us than some people ( that ) asteroids are being named after now. &quot; Mr. Spock died in 1985 , shortly after the space rock was named for him . And Gibson has gone_on to become a research assistant at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . Meanwhile , scientists hope that the controversy over what to name asteroids is settled soon . At next month ' s IAU general_assembly of 3 # 000 astronomers , Marsden said he expects to pitch a simpler idea : allowing a computer to invent names by randomly grouping several melodic vowels and consonants . &quot; The name won ' t make any sense to anybody , &quot; Marsden said . &quot; But at least it will sound good. &quot;</TEXT>
