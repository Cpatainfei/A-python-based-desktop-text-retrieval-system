   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES : TODAY ' S TOPIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whenever a popular public figure falls from grace , there is always one inevitable question : How could it happen ? How could someone rich , famous , powerful and widely admired allow drugs , sex , scandal or crime to ruin their life ? The answer , many experts say , is simple . We expect far too_much from our public figures and we too easily confer heroic status on basically ordinary people , many of whom tend to have the same character flaws as the rest of us . Still , the sight of a sullen O.J. Simpson sitting in a courtroom facing murder_charges , or President Clinton facing sexual-harassment charges , or baseball star Dwight Gooden coping_with drug problems leaves many wondering if there are any true heroes in our society . In today ' s Youth Opinion , some youngsters remind us that there are people worthy of unbridled respect and admiration . Not surprisingly , their heroes are not likely to appear on some artificial roster of the &quot; Ten Most Admired Men or Women in America. &quot; Their heroes are real people : the folks next door , the unheralded leaders who have taken a stand against drugs or prejudice , pioneers in a field , and even their parents . So , why is it that in the public ' s perception the lines often seem blurred between heroes , role_models and celebrities ? Why are many of our so-called heroes actors and athletes instead of social_workers and teachers ? &quot; One factor is the media and a culture that defines what a perfect person is , &quot; says Leo Braudy , author of &quot; The Frenzy of Renown : Fame and Its History. &quot; &quot; We confuse fame with heroism . There is a desire to admire others but whether someone we admire is an actual hero is another question . &quot; Heroes are often very different ; they do strange and historic things , &quot; adds Braudy . &quot; A hero is someone who accomplishes something for the community . Many heroes are anonymous. &quot; Adds Charles Adams , an English_professor at Whittier College , &quot; There is a difference between heroism and just being famous . Heroes must have a social consciousness . They must have the desire to transcend the mundane in our existence in some positive sense . &quot; I don ' t think a hero needs to be a perfect being , &quot; Adams says . &quot; I don ' t think a role_model needs to be a perfect being . that ' s asking a bit much. &quot; Yet , Americans tend to demand perfection of their public figures . They want them to be heroes and role_models , paragons of our society . Historically , it ' s an impossibility . &quot; Any kind of honest assessment shows heroes are anything but role_models , &quot; says Michael Near , an English_professor at Occidental College . &quot; We live_in an era of metaphor and representation . Rather than looking_at the circumstances in front of us , we fictionalize the reality around us . Someone like O.J. Simpson is the product of our culture . We ' re creating him as someone larger than life. &quot; In fact , the experts remind us , heroes rarely are larger than life . &quot; To be famous doesn ' t require anything good about you at all , &quot; Adams says . &quot; When we think_of heroes , we think_of someone having achieved something good. &quot;</TEXT>
