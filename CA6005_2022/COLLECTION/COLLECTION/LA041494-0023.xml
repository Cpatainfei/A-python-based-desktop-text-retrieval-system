   <HEADLINE> ARAB SUICIDE BOMBING IN ISRAEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; 7 Israelis Killed in Suicide Bombing , &quot; April 7 : What does_it take_to make a massacre ? Killing of Arabs qualifies , but apparently killing of Jews does not . Is it any wonder that Jews question the objectivity of the news media ? In all their reporting , last month ' s events in Hebron are repeatedly referred to as the &quot; Hebron massacre , &quot; while on April 6 Jews were &quot; killed when a car exploded , &quot; almost as though it were nobody ' s fault . Then , these killings are reported as &quot; retaliation &quot; for the Hebron attack , while the latter seemed to come_out of the clear blue -- not as a frustrated response to the murders of hundreds of Jews by Palestinians in a continuing genocidal war by the Palestinians against the Jews . The Hebron event is repeated as background information in every story related to Israel , while any attack on Jews is invariably one day ' s news . Particularly during the remembrance of the slaughter of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust , it behooves us to be especially aware of dangerous subtle undercurrents and not-so-subtle manifestations of anti-Semitism , which refuses to die even in our multicultural society . . . or is it just not politically correct to criticize , let alone condemn Arabs ? DAVIDA FISCHMAN Los Angeles * Regarding the slaying and injury of Jews in Afula and Ashdod -- will we make the same demands on the PLO as we made on Israel after the Hebron attack ? Will Arafat issue an unequivocal condemnation of the murders and murderers -- or will he finally be pushed into a mealy-mouthed declaration of regret for the &quot; spilling of blood on both sides &quot; ? Will the PLO make a series of gestures , concessions and confidence-building measures toward Israel to convince it of the PLO ' s sincere desire for peace with Israel ? Of course nobody even dreams that Israel will suspend the negotiations in response to these murders as did the PLO after Hebron . Will the PLO or any Arab country pay compensation to the victims and families in Afula and Ashdod ? Does the PLO intend to disarm and jail the organizers and planners of these killings ? Will Hamas be outlawed as a terrorist organization under Palestinian autonomy ? Will Arabs disavow and condemn these murders ? Will the U.N. Security_Council swing into action and pass a resolution unequivocally condemning these killings ? It ' s obviously fatuous to expect that this time will be different from previous occurrences . Israel will again be expected to forgive and forget the most atrocious , outrageous , inhuman and barbaric attacks upon its people . SIDNEY BROUNSTEIN Beverly Hills * The Times ' editorial of April 2 praises Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s consenting to an international presence in Hebron and describes him as a great peacemaker . Rabin is applauded for his &quot; commitment to peace. &quot; However , it should be understood that while the principle of &quot; intent &quot; is crucial in determining guilt in a court of law , &quot; intent &quot; is not the essential test of responsibility in things political . The true test of statesmanship is not intent , but rather results and consequences . If Rabin ' s many compromises with the Arabs result not in peace and security for Israel , but rather in the establishment of a militant armed PLO state , in Israeli return to the indefensible pre-1967 cease-fire lines , in Syrian control of the Golan Heights and Israel ' s water_supply sources , in further Arab terrorism against Israel , in the redivision of Jerusalem , and in an Israeli society torn by religious and political fratricide verging on civil_war , then Yitzhak Rabin will go_down in history not as the great peacemaker but rather as the Marshal Henri Philippe Petain of Israel .
