   <HEADLINE> CUP MANIA ENDS SOCCER WORLD ' S DOUBT ABOUT U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the World Cup the world had had its doubts about , staged in the only nation on earth that supposedly didn ' t give_a_hoot about the sport . But as the clock ran_out Sunday on the raucous , filled-to-capacity finale between Italy and Brazil , it was the United States that scored the upset in the planet ' s eyes . As the old-moneyed streets of Pasadena swarmed body to body with conga_lines of soccer fans , the championship playoffs that had set world_records for skepticism topped the popularity charts instead . Movie_stars jockeyed with Mexican laborers for a berth in the Rose Bowl . Scalpers were hawking tickets marked_down to $ 1 # 000 a pop . Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vice_President Al Gore and Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian premier , were there . So was a New York construction worker bearing a three-foot-tall statue of St . Anthony of Padua . There were girls from Ipanema and Mercedes Benzes wrapped in Italian flags . There was a guy dressed as Uncle_Sam , begging for tickets . Every third_person on the face of the Earth -- an estimated 2 billion viewers -- was believed to have watched Sunday ' s playoff_game , which was beamed by satellite to 120 nations . No other event -- not the opening ceremonies of the last Olympics , not the Royal Wedding , not the landing of the first man on the moon -- has ever been seen by so many eyes at once . Attendance , too , was unprecedented , despite the stiff ticket prices . In all , the 52-game series drew about 3.5 million fans , surpassing previous World Cup attendance records . For soccer enthusiasts , the biggest surprise was that two-thirds of those tickets were sold in the United States , a nation notable mainly for its tepidity toward the sport . &quot; This has been fantastic for this country , &quot; said Bob D ' Alessio , a native of Italy who traveled from his adopted home of Florida to be at Sunday ' s game . &quot; It ' s not just the foreigners who have been buying the tickets . When you look_around , you see a lot of kids in the stands . Those are the ones who will keep it going. &quot; Soccer , wildly popular in most of the civilized world , has historically been a sports stepchild in the United States . It is baseball that has been this nation ' s &quot; national pastime &quot; and football that has aroused the passions of its fans . So when it was announced that the 1994 World Cup would be played in the United States , the world reaction was skeptical ; even after the games opened June 17 to huge crowds , one international sports columnist gently mocked the indiscriminate cheering among Americans for &quot; a game they do not understand between two nations of which they have not heard. &quot; It didn ' t help that an American_football hero was arrested for a double murder on the opening day of the event . As that case unraveled live_on national TV , the split was a metaphor for Yankee tunnel vision -- here was America riveted to O.J. Simpson , and here was the rest of the planet glued to the World Cup . But as world enthusiasm mounted , sports fans looked_to their roots , and Southern California ' s immigrant communities rallied en masse . Businessmen from the suburbs showed_up at the Rose Bowl with their faces painted to look_like the Swedish flag . High_school kids in Huntington Park rioted in the streets when the Mexican team took_to the fields . Central_American housekeepers -- whose nations were not even among the 24 who competed in the games -- packed the stands anyway , rooting for whatever Latin_American team was in town . And die-hard Americans found that they , too , could cheer , after the U.S. team scored a surprise victory over Colombia and made_it into the second round . The momentum built despite suffocating heat , scandal and tragedy . At one game , the temperature on the field at the Rose Bowl soared to 120 degrees . Another saw Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona stuck_in the stands after banned drugs were found in his system . Still another game began with a moment of silence in memory of Andres Escobar , the Colombian player who was assassinated in Medellin after the top-ranked team returned home_in defeat . In another country , perhaps , interest would have dropped_off as the one team after another was eliminated . But , oddly , fans only cheered harder as the finalists were winnowed down to two . As Sunday ' s game got under way , aerial views of the stadium were patchy with the bright colors of the Brazilian and Italian flags ; but a close inspection revealed that the Rose Bowl crowd was as polyglot as ever . Tom Langan , a 39-year-old writer from Dublin , came toting a sign that said &quot; Brazilians are Irish with tans. &quot; Arturo Cerna of El_Salvador -- waving a sign pleading , &quot; TICKETS ? &quot; -- worked the crowd outside the stadium while yelling at the top of his lungs : &quot; Salvador , Brazil ! Salvador , Brazil ! &quot; The massive , inflated black-and-white soccer_balls bedecking the stadium were covered with the scribbled graffiti of a_hundred lands : Javier Correra , Guayaquil , Ecuador . Brigid , Paris . Wakko , Japan . Sergio Santini , Roma . Meanwhile , as the band struck a pre-game chorus of &quot; La Bamba , &quot; scores of gyrating fans were joined by a couple dressed in the day ' s most cross-cultural garb -- giant ersatz cans of Coke . &quot; I love events , I ' m partial to decadence , &quot; said Eric Squire , a University of San Francisco law_student who ducked out of a bachelor_party at dawn to make his plane down to Sunday ' s game . &quot; This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience . Most Americans don ' t realize that , and they won ' t until it ' s over . You don ' t get this sort of genuine enthusiasm at any U.S. sporting event. ' Despite a sellout crowd at the 91 # 794-capacity Rose Bowl , demand for tickets persisted well beyond kickoff time . When the series opened , tickets for the last three games were available only as part of a package that cost up_to $ 2 # 500 ; individual tickets did not go_on public sale until July 5 . Face_values for tickets to the final game ran from $ 180 to $ 475 , but they swiftly disappeared , and prices began to inflate . As game time approached Sunday , ticket holders milled_around the stadium entrances , hawking extras at 200 % markups , then dropping their prices as the morning waned . By the game ' s end , Pasadena police reported , eight people had been arrested for scalping outside the Rose Bowl . Fans , meanwhile , held_out for last-minute bargains , hoping that the scalpers would get desperate after kickoff . &quot; Maybe , after the game starts , I can get a ticket cheap , &quot; hoped Tato Duran , who paced outside the stadium with a Brazilian flag around his waist . &quot; What else can they do with them ? Eat them for lunch ? &quot; By game time , however , it was clear that , as with so_much in America , the tickets were going where the money was . As play got under way , scores of fans who were not lucky enough to get them clamored around a TV in a booth outside Gate A , straining for a glimpse of the action . At one point , a dozen fans pushed over a trash_can and climbed_on top , just to get a better look_at the game on the small screen , while a gaggle of drum-beating Brazilian fans_danced around the can . While thousands more meandered around outside the stadium , looking lost , the stands within the Rose Bowl were studded with celebrities -- Gore , Schwarzenegger , former President George_Bush , actor Dustin Hoffman . Though the championship of the world was at stake , the mood at first was less raucous than at some earlier contests , perhaps because of the hoity-toity crowd . But when Italy ' s Roberto Baggio overshot his penalty kick_in the game ' s key , final moment , soccer ' s legendary passion overcame even the blue-blood set -- fans on both sides burst into tears and began to sob . Before then , Andrew Bettene , a San Francisco resident who is a native of Sao Paulo , Brazil , attributed the relative restraint to the &quot; big-money crowd. &quot; &quot; I paid $ 450 a piece for these tickets . Big-money people don ' t make big noise . If you want to see the excitement , check_out the TVs in some of the local bars. &quot; Indeed , even before the bars on Old Pasadena ' s Colorado Boulevard opened at 10 a.m. , the lines were already a block long . As those without big money and hot tickets settled for small screens and cold beer , every club and restaurant on the historic thoroughfare filled to capacity . Mike Mendoza , 27 , of Whittier , joined a group of cheering Brazilian fans inside the 35er bar . He said he cheered first for the United States , then for Mexico and finally for Brazil to &quot; support my Latino brothers. &quot; Meanwhile , inside Q ' s , 10 billiard_tables sat abandoned as the crowd watched a bank of TV_sets tuned to a Spanish-language station . &quot; It ' s the Old_World versus the New World , &quot; exulted Bill Martin Jr. , 29 , of Downey . &quot; It ' s the Americas versus Europe. &quot; The bar crowds -- who celebrated prodigiously but peacefully last week after Brazil won the semifinals at the Rose Bowl -- continued the tradition of affable revelry as Sunday afternoon wore_on . Colorado Boulevard was partially blocked_off as hordes of triumphant fans continued to pour into the street hours after the game ended , kicking soccer_balls three stories into the air , gyrating down the sidewalks in impromptu conga_lines , beating drums and breaking_into wild renditions of Brazil ' s national dance , the samba . Three hours after the final soccer kick at the Rose Bowl , people were still arriving in Old Pasadena -- about 20 # 000 by 7:30 p.m. Rafael Jacinto , 29 , of Scottsdale , Ariz. , was so exhausted from partying that he lay flat on his back in the street , using a Brazilian flag as a beach mat , and weakly tooted a horn . &quot; I ' m dead tired , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m going_to rest a little bit , then I ' ll party all night. &quot; At one point , revelers marched down Colorado Boulevard with a half-block-long green-and-yellow banner , the Brazilian colors . The banner soon became a rope for a giant game of tug-of-war , and finally , the crowd began ripping it to pieces for souvenirs . Joining the crowd was Macsuara , 36 , a shaman from the Kadiweu tribe in the Amazon region , who had reportedly blessed the team before before their first playoff_game in the U.S. Wearing a head dress of toucan and macaw feathers , his face striped with paint , he shook a metal rattle as the crowd danced around him . Some fans spritzed the crowd with champagne from the balconies as shirtless young_men waited , open-mouthed , below . At one corner , two women appeared in a second-story window wearing one yellow &quot; Brasil &quot; T-shirt with two holes cut for their heads . &quot; Ole , ole , ole , ole -- Bra- sil ! Bra- sil ! &quot; the crowd yelled . Meanwhile , law_enforcement officers -- who patrolled Old Pasadena aggressively during the past month for violations of alcoholic_beverage control laws -- maintained a close watch . By early evening , 44 people had been arrested on charges ranging from assault with a deadly weapon to gambling and reckless driving and public intoxication , according to Pasadena Police Cmdr . Mary Schander . Both on the streets and in the stadium , security was the tightest yet for this World Cup , with uniformed police_officers stationed every 20 feet in the bowl . Several hundred sheriff ' s deputies , on foot and horseback , patrolled the crowd , some of them with video cameras . Security preparations , 18 months in the making , had been considered of paramount importance . U.S. apathy notwithstanding , soccer fans in other countries have been known to let their passions get_the_best of them , and past games have erupted in lethal rioting . But as game after game passed without serious incident -- no matter how agonizing the defeat or how thrilling the victory -- the 1994 World Cup gradually became notable for its paucity of hooliganism . &quot; It ' s fun . No one ' s giving us a hard_time , &quot; said Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Deputy Joe Martinez , as he kept tabs on Sunday ' s Rose Bowl crowd . Amid the revelry , the biggest question was whether soccer mania might finally catch_on in the United States . &quot; Soccer brings everyone together , &quot; exulted Meire de Farias , a 28-year-old teacher from Sao Paulo , as she threw her arms into the air and danced her way_out of the stadium after Brazil ' s victory . &quot; I hope the Americans will come_to love soccer like we do. &quot; Brazilian columnist Alberto Helena Jr . remained skeptical , but predicted &quot; at least an incremental interest &quot; in the sport . But Magid Mazen , an Egyptian who now lives_in Boston and who traveled across the country with his 11-year-old son to see the game , was substantially more optimistic . &quot; It was the United States that won today , &quot; Mazen said . &quot; Soccer has been born in the United States . . . ( and ) what makes me happiest is my son is here to share this with me . He is going_to be a soccer fan and his children will be soccer fans. &quot; Diane Bishop , a Beverly Hills fan , agreed . &quot; I hope it takes_off now , and I think it will , &quot; she said . Either way , Bishop added , she is sorry to see the World Cup come_to an end . &quot; It has been a great party , &quot; she sighed . &quot; The rest of the summer will be pretty boring after this. &quot; Times staff writers Tina Daunt , Shawn Hubler , Patrick J . McDonnell , Edmund Newton , Thomas S . Mulligan and Vicki Torres contributed to this report .</TEXT>
