   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN ENDS BROADCAST BAN ON IRISH EXTREMISTS ; NEGOTIATIONS : PRIME_MINISTER MAJOR ALSO BACKS REFERENDUM ON NORTHERN_IRELAND ' S FATE . BOTH MOVES INDICATE DESIRE TO MOVE AHEAD ON PEACE PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister John Major ended a much-ridiculed ban on broadcasting the voices of extremist leaders in Northern_Ireland on Friday and declared his support for a referendum of Catholics and Protestants to determine their political fate . Major ' s comments , during a visit to Belfast , constituted his strongest signal yet that he is prepared to make progress on negotiations among the contending Protestant and Catholic forces in the deadly 25-year-old Northern_Ireland conflict even though he has not received an explicit guarantee that a recently declared Irish_Republican_Army cease-fire is permanent . The government also further reduced security measures in Northern_Ireland , agreeing to open a number of roads connecting the British-ruled province with the independent Republic_of_Ireland . British security_forces had erected concrete barricades along hundreds of the rural roads in an effort to deny easy cross-border movement to terrorists and their materiel . The lifting of the broadcast ban appeared primarily intended to encourage more peace overtures from Catholic republicans , while the vow of support for a referendum was an attempt to allay the fears of Protestant unionists . The ban on broadcasting the voices of both Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries has been the source of much derision and mostly affects Gerry Adams , leader of the outlawed IRA ' s legal political wing , Sinn Fein . While Adams ' face is regularly seen on British television , his voice is dubbed by an actor who merely repeats Adams ' words , sometimes in less than perfect synchronization . &quot; The broadcasting restrictions were brought_in to stop supporters of terrorist organizations from using television and radio to justify violence , &quot; Major said . &quot; I believe the restrictions are no longer serving the purpose for which they were intended . . . . Ways have been found to circumvent them . But most importantly , we are now in very different circumstances. &quot; The IRA , the group battling for unification of Northern_Ireland with predominantly Catholic Ireland , declared a cease-fire Aug . 31 in response to proposals for peace talks jointly sponsored by the governments in London and Dublin . Major has said he would be ready to begin talks only when the IRA or Sinn Fein states unequivocally that the days of guns and bombs are gone forever . Neither has done so publicly , though the IRA has not committed any act of terrorism since its declaration . The same is not true of its extremist Protestant counterparts , who have staged several bombings since Aug . 31 . The promise of a referendum on any settlement reached around the negotiating table was meant to reassure Protestants that they will not be separated from Britain against their will , according to many observers . Since they are now a majority in Northern_Ireland , the Protestants could presumably block the outcome the nationalists say they are still seeking : unification with Ireland . Many Protestants say they believe that a &quot; secret deal &quot; exists between Dublin and London that will force them into what they consider an odious fate . &quot; Let me say to all_the people of Northern_Ireland , &quot; Major said , &quot; the referendum means that it will be your choice whether to accept the outcome &quot; of any negotiations . The opening of the border roads was a significant concession to Catholic nationalists , many of whom believe that free movement across the borders means a de_facto unification with Ireland , if not constitutional merger . Activists have been playing a cat-and-mouse game with British security_forces for several weeks , bulldozing border blockades by day only to have them replaced by the_British overnight .</TEXT>
