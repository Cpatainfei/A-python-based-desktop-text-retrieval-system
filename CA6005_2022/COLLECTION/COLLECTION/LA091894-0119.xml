   <HEADLINE> A RELUCTANT WARRIOR ; THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS HAITI : GUNSHOTS IN THE QUIET OF NIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The eve of change , whether by invasion , coup d ' etat or election , is the most dangerous time in Haiti , and the quiet night , from dusk to dawn , is the scariest . That is when all ears strain for the sound of faint gunshots , knowing the hunt is_on . Almost 80 years after the first U.S. invasion of Haiti , I am lying_awake thinking this in the middle of the night . I am not with my friends , family or colleagues in Haiti because I have taken a public position against the regime and been warned to stay away . But my heart , my eyes and ears are with them and I feel that familiar tightening of emotions -- fear , anticipation , dread , conflict and hope -- that characterize life and political struggle in Haiti . I want to know where my friend Evans Paul , the pro-democratic mayor of Port-au-Prince , is tonight . Which safe house he will seek refuge in , whether they will find him . Evans is among the most visible figures of Haiti ' s popular resistance to dictatorship , a resistance largely ignored by the Western media . More_than 500 Haitians have been killed these past three years , but 300 # 000 have survived and are in hiding -- like Paul . If the generals fall , those in hiding will be ready to help Jean-Bertrand Aristide rebuild Haiti , and that is why they must die now , before the Americans arrive to protect them . That is the word on the street . For a second , my heart pounds wildly , and I am terrified and I am running , because the bullets are aimed at me . Who is being arrested tonight ? Who is keeping watch for the U.S. planes from an open square of concrete inside one of Haiti ' s prisons ? That is where prisoners sleep , without bedding , with gutters for toilets . The prisons are said to be packed , though no human-rights organization has gotten inside to document who has been detained , beaten or tortured , which , if any , bodies have been dumped . It is only recently that President Bill_Clinton acknowledged that torture had become routine in Haiti . It is always in moments like this , when power is shifting and revenge is in the air , that massacres occur , often in rural prisons , out_of_sight of the television_cameras . I wonder if my friend Christophe is awake ; whether he caught any of the Aristide leaflets dropped over the capital last week . At 37 , Christophe has worked his entire adult life as a servant . He writes poorly in French , cannot read Creole and has little chance of a better job . Until recently , he and his wife shared a narrow cot with their 7-year-old son ; now they have a baby girl . I wonder where she is sleeping . Christophe says the last three years have been hell -- he has no other word for it . Two centuries after Haiti ' s independence , he feels_like a slave . Aristide is not God to him , but a courageous man , a man of faith who has not abandoned his brothers . Haiti is a small country , and politics have always become personal too quickly . Many families are divided by politics ; mine is no different . I wonder what my cousins and their friends , part of Haiti ' s ruling elite , are feeling . Many have taken refuge in their second homes_in Miami , glued to CNN . Those remaining debate their options : Whether to head for the Dominican border or go_up to their summer cottages above Port-au-Prince , with a safe and spectacular view of the action to come . I know some are mentally replaying the tumultuous events of 1915 , when , days before the U.S. Marines landed , the head of Haitian President Villebrun Guillaume Sam was paraded on a stick . Many of the elite consider themselves apolitical , victims of a political nightmare , vulnerable to being attacked for being wealthy , for being light-skinned . Now , with an invasion , they worry about being mistaken for Americans and getting shot by newly armed , rum-drunk Haitian recruits . It is all part of the elite ' s enduring nightmare , the one where Aristide is cast as a monster looking the other way as vengeful masses attack the houses and property of the rich and civil_war breaks_out . To protect them from this nightmare , their embattled childhood friend , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras stood_up to Clinton and became a hero . Yet , his army is seen as corrupt , drug trafficking and crime have flourished and , with the embargo , the country is sinking . All this has left the elite feeling frightened and righteous . They , too , have become prey to extrajudicial violence , to bribes and threats . The attitude of the elite toward a U.S. invasion is equally conflicted . Many have U.S. passports , bank_accounts and property . They educate their children here , pay taxes and feel as much a part of American culture as they do Haitian . Though they vehemently oppose an effort to restore Aristide , they nostalgically recall the U.S. occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 as a golden period of prosperity and order -- for those with money . What about Aristide , a man I knew before he was president , when he was an orphanage director with_children perpetually clinging_to him ? He is the cat with nine lives who has used_up a_few , having survived several assassination attempts . He rarely sleeps well , and right now , amid everything else , he is mourning the assassination of his mentor and close friend , Father Jean-Marie Vincent . I worry these may be the last weeks of Aristide , a man who has changed the face of Haitian history . There is no doubt in my mind that his enemies will try to kill him if he returns . Nor do I doubt that he is intent_on returning . Whatever his private fears , he acts like a man with a sense of destiny , someone for whom others have died -- loved ones like Vincent -- taking the blows and bullets meant for him . It is hard for me to imagine him back in power in a demilitarized Haiti , protected by an international peacekeeping force that will cede power to a retrained civil police_force . It seems only yesterday that Cedras and the army betrayed Aristide in the coup d ' etat . And that the Clinton_Administration , while giving Aristide sanctuary , let CIA officials attack his character and motives , minimized the achievements of his government , then downplayed the scope of human-rights abuses in Haiti -- allowing the bravest and brightest democrats to be killed or chased out_to sea . It is only one of a_thousand ironies that the State_Department last week finally acknowledged that human-rights abuses today are comparable_to those of the notorious Francois ( Papa Doc ) Duvalier regime , then used this fact as ballast for an invasion . U.S. foreign_policy toward Haiti continues to be an offshoot of our domestic concern about immigration and Clinton ' s need to appease Florida lawmakers . His turnabout on Aristide reflects less his concern about human_rights or democracy , than his belated assessment that the only way to keep refugees away from Miami is to stop the murders in Haiti . I can understand why Aristide might have trouble embracing an invasion , never mind trusting Clinton . The sun is almost up now , and somewhere across the river , another political exile , Alerte Balance , has found a haven . Like Aristide , she has become a symbol of survival for Haitians , especially women , whose role in this struggle is overlooked . Balance was cast in the international spotlight recently , after Haitian secret_police hacked off her arms with a machete and left her for dead at the killing fields of Titanyen , outside Port-au-Prince . She is alive to recount the horror and , in another cruel irony , she has become empowered in her new role as a spokeswoman for Haitian democracy . But I imagine there are moments when her brain cannot accept her loss of limb -- common among amputees -- and she may suffer from phantom pains for decades . Her life and condition may be an apt metaphor for the reality facing Haiti and all Haitians today . No miracle -- no Aristide , no Clinton , no invasion -- can give_back what has been lost . But there is still hope for recovery , and a need for assistance . Healing will take_place amid fresh memories of loss and lingering pain .</TEXT>
