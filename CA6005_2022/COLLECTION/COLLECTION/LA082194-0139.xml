   <HEADLINE> WHY VIETNAM-ERA ' DOVES ' WANT TO INVADE HAITI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The debate over U.S. policy toward Haiti is heavily laden with historical irony . Like most liberals who came_of_age during the Vietnam era , National Security Adviser W . An thony Lake , Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott and most other senior officials in the Clinton_Administration who favor an invasion were vehement opponents of military intervention in the Third_World . And , if the Administration does send_in the Marines , its harshest critics will include many Republicans who ardently backed the U.S. role in Vietnam , as well as the more recent interventions in Grenada and Panama . There is also a contemporary irony . The potentially divisive effects of the exodus of Haitians -- and now Cubans -- on domestic politics are increasingly driving foreign_policy , a development that Lake and Talbott would surely resist . Yet , the political anxieties have given added weight to their solution -- invasion . Lake and Talbott are both heirs of the Wilsonian tradition of liberal internationalism and grandsons of the generation of &quot; wise_men &quot; -- such_as John J . McCloy , Dean Acheson and W . Averill Harriman -- who guided the United States , in the 1940s , into the uncharted seas of world leadership . But both rebelled against their elders over the Vietnam_War : Lake as a Foreign Service officer serving on the staff of then-National Security Adviser Henry A . Kissinger , and Talbott as a student at Yale and Oxford , where he roomed with young Bill_Clinton . In opposing the war , neither Lake nor Talbott rejected the idea that the United States had a unique responsibility to lead the world . Quite the contrary . Their opposition flowed_from a belief that Washington was betraying national values and undermining the country ' s ability to lead when it subverted governments and aided corrupt dictators . Conservatives , by contrast , were never much interested in_questions of morality and global responsibility . They saw military intervention in Vietnam as a legitimate exercise of national sovereignty . For them , the overriding issue was always &quot; American &quot; interests and the threat to them posed by communism . They were internationalists out of necessity , not conviction . It may be unfair , then , to chastise the Administration ' s &quot; hawk &quot; converts on Haiti . For Lake , Talbott and other neo-Wilsonians , the end of the Cold_War frees the United States to return to its task of making the world safe for democracy . Geopolitics no longer forces us to intervene on the &quot; wrong &quot; side in Third_World struggles . Instead , we can use power to promote change in places like Haiti . There is also a more subtle dimension to the role reversals . During the past two decades , liberals who opposed the Vietnam_War , and interventionism in_general , were politically mauled by neo-conservatives for their reputed unwillingness to stand_up to communism and use force . Lake and many other Administration officials still bear the scars of those political attacks . The stakes in Haiti are thus doubly high for the Administration ' s liberal internationalists . In their judgment , a failure to stand_up to the Haitian thugs would undermine America ' s ability to promote democracy and reinforce Republican charges that Democrats are not tough enough to conduct an effective foreign_policy . But they may be trapped in a no-win situation . There is a possibility that an invasion could be carried_out successfully with a minimum of casualties . But the post-invasion challenge of transforming Haiti into a viable democracy would be immense . At a minimum , it would require a tremendous infusion of assistance . Even under the best possible circumstances , it is highly doubtful that a U.S. invasion would be popular at_home . Americans almost certainly share the conservatives ' doubts that U.S. interests are engaged in Haiti . A strong case could be made that taxpayer dollars would be squandered to appease the Congressional Black Caucus and protect the Administration ' s political interests in Florida . If an invasion proved difficult and costly , and American lives were lost , the consequences would be calamitous . The perception that Bill_Clinton and Talbott , who sat_out the Vietnam_War at Yale and Oxford , were putting the lives of U.S. soldiers at risk for dubious reasons would be political dynamite certain to be detonated by Republicans . The Administration would thus be wise_to step back from the brink . Clinton should convert the crisis in Haiti into an opportunity to level with the American people and begin to develop policies that will allow us to end the self-defeating battle between liberal internationalism and conservative nationalism . A first_step would be to outline why U.S. military intervention is a flawed strategy . The President could cite the legacy of past interventions , almost all_of which failed to produce either democracy or economic development . He could also applaud the wisdom of American skepticism toward international crusades . Second , he could emphasize the paucity of quick or cost-free fixes to the problems of dictatorship and underdevelopment in countries like Haiti . Money spent on a military operation , the President might contend , would be_better used_to prevent future Haitis . Third , Clinton should initiate a comprehensive review of sanctions . Paradoxically , the suffering of Haiti ' s ordinary citizens caused by current sanction policy is putting more pressure on the United States to go_in than on the junta to get_out . We should thus consider ending general economic sanctions but strengthen measures aimed at freezing the foreign assets of Haitian elites and restricting travel . Fourth , the President should make_it clear that the principal responsibility for removing the thugs in Port-au-Prince rests with the Haitian people . The United States would be prepared to assist them in the same way that the_French assisted us during our revolution and the Reagan_Administration aided rebels in Afghanistan , Angola , Cambodia and Nicaragua . Such a threat would send strong tremors through Haiti ' s ruling elites . Finally , the President should decide whether we should accept Haitian refugees . With the Cuban exodus approaching crisis proportions , the refugee issue is more complex than ever . The moral case for accepting them is strong , but the practical one for discouraging them , or diverting them elsewhere , is valid . Should Clinton takes these five steps , he would be acknowledging that a liberal internationalist approach cannot provide a viable answer to the dilemmas created by Haiti -- and now Cuba . Only then will he be able to deal with the role of domestic politics in foreign policy. *</TEXT>
