   <HEADLINE> IN SEARCH OF A MASTER ; THE ARTISTRY AND CREATIVITY OF THE MIDFIELDER HOLDS THE KEY ; WHOSE BRUSH WILL SHOW THE STROKE OF GENIUS THIS YEAR ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was Socrates -- the Brazilian midfielder , not the Greek philosopher -- who once observed that soccer &quot; became popular because it was considered an art. &quot; In recent years , however , soccer artists have become more difficult to find and the emphasis on winning at all costs has robbed the sport of much of its beauty . The financial rewards for success have become so big for clubs and players that fear of failure has brought a paralysis to the game . Too many teams nowadays play not to lose , rather than to win . Pele ' s &quot; beautiful game &quot; has become a dour affair in all too many instances . As long ago as 1978 , Helmut Schoen , then coach of the German national team , remarked on this depressing trend during the World Cup in Argentina . &quot; The World Cup tournaments of 1958 and 1962 were garden_parties compared with what is involved now , with the pressures that have developed , &quot; Schoen said . &quot; The increase in pressure seems continuous from one competition to the next . &quot; In 1966 it was terrific , in 1970 it was worse , in 1974 still more terrible and now it is completely out of hand . Soccer has become almost a kind of war. &quot; Despite Schoen ' s comments , the 1978 World Cup did thrust into international stardom at least one artist , a player of exceptional skill who exemplified everything beautiful about the game . His name was Osvaldo ( Ossie ) Ardilles , and his genius in midfield was every bit as important to Argentina ' s World Cup triumph that year as the goals scored by Mario Kempes . Later , after Ardilles had moved to England to play and eventually coach , a rival player in the_English League summed_up the little Argentine ' s skills simply : &quot; He was everywhere . It was like trying to tackle dust. &quot; In other words , one of the prime requirements for international stardom is the ability to appear and disappear at will , to be elusive , to leave your opponents trying to guess your every move . There are midfielders who are nothing more_than defenders playing in a more forward role ; and there are midfielders who are nothing more_than strikers in disguise , the so-called &quot; withdrawn &quot; forwards . But the true midfielder is the key player on the field . Without him , the game cannot be won . He is the player who dazzles the opposing defenses , slicing them to shreds with his unexpected , darting runs or his calculated , precise passing . He is often referred to as the team ' s &quot; creative genius , &quot; the so-called &quot; brains &quot; of the side . Alas , such players are few and far between . The reason is simple : The variety of skills required is enormous . To begin with , the creative midfielder must be highly intelligent , with an ability to read the game at a glance , to sense the opposition ' s strengths and weaknesses and design a tactical plan to take_advantage of what he has seen . The ability to improvise is crucial to the midfielder ' s success . He also must be an exceptional athlete -- not necessarily powerful or strong , but as quick-moving as he is quick-thinking . He must be able to leap and twist and turn at speed , often under pressure from defenders trying to cut him down with vicious , scything tackles . He must be calm , almost imperious , and have extraordinary vision , with the ability to see not only all_of the play going_on around him but the possibilities inherent in that play . In short , he must have the ability to think two or three or four moves ahead . He must keep running , moving_into positions where he can do the most damage . Ferenc Puskas , one of the great Hungarian stars of the 1950s , explained it this way , referring not just to midfielders but to all players : &quot; The good player keeps playing even without the ball . All the time he is placing himself so that when the ball comes_to him , he is able to make_good use of it. &quot; To the creative midfielder , that &quot; good use &quot; usually means passing , rather than shooting . He must have the ability to pass the ball to the right place at the right time with exactly the right pace to set_up his teammates while foiling defenders and the offside trap . It was Glenn Hoddle , the former English national team player who never received the respect and adulation of the fans that his skill deserved , who described the value of timely and accurate passing in this fashion : &quot; For me , the ball is a diamond . If you have a diamond , you don ' t get_rid_of it , you offer it. &quot; So it must be with the creative player at the center of the action , the hub in the midfield wheel_around whom all plays revolve . Will the 1994 World Cup feature any such players ? Will an Ardilles be discovered in America ? Perhaps , but it is more likely that an established midfield star will shine the brightest this summer . There is , for instance , Carlos Valderrama , with his startling hairstyle and spectacular skills . Valderrama is the imperious midfielder personified . The Colombian genius strolls about the field with a seemingly indifferent air , fooling opponents into thinking he is uninvolved . Then , before they know it , Valderrama has glided unnoticed into a dangerous position , received the ball , turned and passed it to a totally unmarked forward and watched the shot flash into the net before anyone even realized what he was up_to . &quot; You can put Valderrama in a phone_booth , put six defenders on him and he ' d still come_out with the ball , &quot; is the way an awe-struck Sigi Schmid , an assistant coach on the U.S. team , has described him . There is good reason why Valderrama , 32 , of the Junior Barranquilla club in Colombia , was South_America ' s player of the year in 1987 and again in 1993 . He is talented , experienced and dangerous -- the perfect combination for a creative midfielder surrounded by strikers of the highest caliber . Similar accolades could be bestowed on several other World Cup midfielders . Brazil , the World Cup favorite , is counting_on Rai to rediscover his touch . Since moving from world club champion Sao Paolo to new French champion Paris St Germain last year , Rai has struggled to impose himself on the game . Perhaps being back and serving such strikers as Romario , Bebeto , Muller and Brazil ' s latest sensation , 17-year-old Ronaldo , will inspire Rai . After all , he is the younger brother of the brilliant Socrates . Germany , the defending champion and second favorite , has moved team captain Lothar Matthaeus back from midfield into the sweeper position and is relying_on Andreas Moeller of Juventus to provide midfield inspiration . Moeller , 26 , is well-suited to the role , being tactically astute and inventive too . If Moeller is thwarted , Germany also can turn_to the diminutive but brilliant Thomas Haessler , 27 , one of the stars of the 1992 European Championship . Haessler , of AS Roma , has the added advantage of being a superb free-kick taker . The Netherlands , another potential World Cup winner , has the experienced Frank Rijkaard at the center of its midfield . Although he has been playing a more defensive role in recent years , Rijkaard can turn a game with a single pass . Because he has Dennis Bergkamp and Peter Van Vossen to supply , as well as a_couple_of fine wings in Bryan Roy and Marc Overmars , Rijkaard , 31 , of Ajax Amsterdam , has become more of a threat than ever . Argentina , of course , has what used to be the best midfielder in the world at its disposal . If Diego Maradona , now 33 and without a club , can recapture even 50 % of his former skills , he could have a huge impact on Argentina ' s chances , especially if he can supply the ammunition for star strikers Gabriel Batistuta , Claudio Caniggia and Abel Balbo . If Maradona fails , there is always Leonardo Rodriguez , 27 , of Borussia Dortmund in Germany . Rodriguez has nowhere near the skill of Maradona , but he is twice as reliable and quite capable in his own_right . There are others -- Belgium ' s Enzo Scifo , Bolivia ' s Erwin ( Platini ) Sanchez , Romania ' s Gheorghe Hagi and Spain ' s newest star , Julen Guerrero -- who probably will write their names in World Cup history in the monthlong tournament starting Friday .</TEXT>
