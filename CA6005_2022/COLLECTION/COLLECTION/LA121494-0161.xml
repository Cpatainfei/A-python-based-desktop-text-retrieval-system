   <HEADLINE> STORM SHOWS OFF ; WEATHER : WATERSPOUTS AFFORD SPECTACULAR VIEW ALONG THE COAST AS SYSTEM PASSES THROUGH . THERE ' S A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN AGAIN THURSDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The tail_end of a storm system that passed_through Orange County on Tuesday created unusual waterspouts off the coast of Newport Beach , giving observers along a bluff in Corona del Mar a spectacular view of one 1 # 500-foot funnel cloud . &quot; You could see water flying all around , &quot; said Marine Safety Officer Gordon Reed . Others along a bluff in Corona del Mar watched as the larger of two waterspouts danced above the ocean ' s surface shortly after noon . &quot; You could see the water swirling and being pulled_up into the clouds . A sailboat was real close to it , and we thought it would get blown away , &quot; said Roger Muscente , 31 , of Mission Viejo , a real_estate appraiser who shot pictures of the 1 # 500-foot funnel cloud . Neither waterspout touched land , and no damage was reported . Typically described as an &quot; ocean tornado , &quot; a waterspout is a spinning funnel of air that picks_up water . It is , however , usually weaker in velocity than a land tornado . Meteorologists believe the two waterspouts formed from the leftover energy of a storm system that was moving through Southern California and passed_through Orange County late Monday night . &quot; Usually , there ' s instability behind a cold_front , and all_the moisture , clouds and upper level energy from the jet_stream can form waterspouts , &quot; said Curtis Brack , a meteorologist at WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . The 1 # 500-foot waterspout was spotted half a mile offshore of Newport Beach ' s jetty entrance by marine safety officials at 12:10 p.m. It lasted for about 15 minutes . The second spout was smaller and formed closer to Laguna Beach shortly after the first . &quot; We see spouts once every couple years , &quot; Reed said . &quot; The one we saw today was spectacular because it was well-defined from what I ' ve seen over the last 25 years. &quot; Michael Buechi and another friend were with Muscente on their way to lunch when they spotted the waterspout and pulled their car over to watch from a nearby bluff . &quot; Elegant is probably the best way to describe the waterspout , &quot; said Buechi , 33 , of Mission Viejo . &quot; The bluff was the closest spot you could be to that funnel unless you were in a boat. &quot; About 15 other observers on the bluff watched as the spout crept closer to three boats , but dissipated before directly crossing their paths , said Buechi . Waterspouts usually create high waves within a half-mile radius of their funnels . The spouts last only a_few minutes and are rare , with only five to 10 forming along the Southern California coast each year , said Brack . Elsewhere in Orange County , Monday night ' s showers dumped nearly half an inch of rain in some parts and created slick roadways for Tuesday morning ' s commute , with a higher than normal number of traffic accidents reported by the California Highway Patrol . * &quot; We had an unusual amount of accidents between 6 and 7 a.m. , &quot; said CHP Officer Kari Keul in Santa Ana . &quot; Obviously , oil and water don ' t mix , but motorists just need to decrease their speeds when it rains because it ' s going_to take longer to stop when the road is wet as opposed to dry. &quot; Westminster CHP officers also responded to a number of accidents during their normally quiet period of the night . &quot; We had four collisions right after midnight , &quot; said CHP Officer K . Canzano . &quot; And while I can ' t tell you if it can be blamed on the rain , that ' s an unusual amount , so I can imagine the rain had something to do with it. &quot; The cold_front that brought Monday night ' s showers came from the Gulf of Alaska and headed toward San Diego late Tuesday . The showers began about 11 p.m. Monday and ended about 5 a.m. Tuesday . Between 8 a.m Monday and 8 a.m. Tuesday Santa Ana received . 31 inches of rain ; Villa Park Dam . 24 inches ; Santiago Peak . 43 inches ; and Costa Mesa . 24 inches . Forecasters predict today will be partly cloudy , with cool temperatures and no rainfall . Thursday will be partly cloudy with a 10 % to 20 % chance of rain . Skies will clear_up Friday , with warmer temperatures in the upper 60s and sunny skies expected for the weekend . Highs through Friday will be in the upper 50s to mid-60s . Coastal areas should expect temperatures in the upper 50s to mid-60s , inland valleys will be in the upper 50s , and areas in upper elevations should expect temperatures in the 40s . On the coast , five-foot swells and one- to three-foot waves are expected , with west to southwesterly winds at 5 to 15 m.p.h .</TEXT>
