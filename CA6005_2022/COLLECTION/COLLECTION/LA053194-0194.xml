   <TEXT> Giggles . that ' s what she gets for uttering the &quot; f &quot; word . Naturally . Hands on the hips of her faded jeans , lipsticked smile starting to crack , Lucy Swindell is perched casually at the podium , calling the swim coach ' ' a damn , picky bastard , &quot; making snide comments about the new girl ' s butt . She saunters around , ticking_off a string of forbidden phrases -- words that rhyme with &quot; class , &quot; &quot; spit , &quot; &quot; witch &quot; and , of course , &quot; luck. &quot; Now the teen-agers are laughing out loud , trying to swallow nervous snickers as this 51-year-old woman -- their teacher , for gosh sake -- forges ahead : &quot; It wasn ' t exactly an orgy of pleasure for me , you dumb . . . &quot; * Not exactly the vocabulary you expect from a high_school English_teacher , but Swindell is just reading aloud from the assigned text , Judith Guest ' s novel &quot; Ordinary People. &quot; Chapter 3 to be precise . Swindell has been teaching this book at La Palma ' s John F . Kennedy High_School in the Anaheim Union High_School District for more_than a decade . For just as long , people have been telling her -- and teachers nationwide -- not to . &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is among the most frequently challenged books nationwide , says the Washington-based public-interest group People for the American Way . Last year , California led the nation with more censorship struggles than any other state -- including one concerning &quot; Ordinary People &quot; in the Anaheim school district . To delve beneath the political debate , The Times spent a month studying the book alongside Swindell ' s students . A reporter watched classroom sessions , then read students ' personal reflections in daily journals , essays and poems exploring the characters ' feelings . Published in 1976 and later made into a film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture , &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is a 263-page bestseller about 17-year-old Conrad Jarrett , who grew_up pampered in suburban Chicago , then lost big_brother Buck in a boating accident . Racked with guilt over Buck ' s death , the teen slits his wrist , leaving blood in the bathroom and himself in a psychiatric_hospital . Despite problems communicating with his harried tax-attorney father and self-centered socialite mother , the boy survives . But it remains unclear whether the family will . So what ' s the big fuss ? Well , there ' s the frank talk_about suicide . Fights between parent and child , including some harsh back talk . Musings about masturbation and premarital intercourse between Conrad and his girlfriend . Plus , the teen-agers in the book talk like teen-agers , which means slang and swearwords . Swindell says she teaches the book to help build cross-generational discussion of dysfunctional families and teen estrangement . that ' s just what keeps it on the firing_line . Critics dislike Guest ' s portrayal of teen and family life and fear that reading about the Jarretts ' inability to communicate will stifle teen-parent dialogue rather than foster it . &quot; It has no place in a teen-ager ' s hands in an English_class , &quot; argues Treva Brown of Anaheim , a single mother of four who led the local protest against the novel . Brown lists 26 reasons why &quot; Ordinary People &quot; doesn ' t belong on district- and state-approved reading lists . Language , sexuality and suicide are her top concerns , but she also contends that the story is &quot; boring , &quot; the author unimportant and the vocabulary too simple to merit a spot in the curriculum . How dare the district allow books laced with words banned in its own discipline code ? &quot; I raised ( my ) kid to be a fine young_man who doesn ' t curse , who doesn ' t swear , who believes that sex before marriage is wrong , &quot; Brown said . &quot; I put him in the public_school system , expecting them to go beyond what I had given him , and they give him this nonsense . It was a slap in my face and a slap in my son ' s face. &quot; The Anaheim school_board and the California Department_of_Education have both rejected Brown ' s request to ban the book , and a recall movement against several Anaheim school_board members failed last month . But the controversy continues , with Brown promising to revive the issue in next fall ' s election . Meanwhile , &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is still being taught . * Kennedy High was the first in the nation to be named for the slain President when it opened in 1964 . At the home of the_Irish , all is green and yellow : healthy lawns under bright sun ; kelly cheerleading uniforms with butter trim ; pale walls with bold letters : &quot; Ask not what your country can do for you . . . . &quot; Inside Classroom No . 3 in the corner of the campus sits Swindell , who started her career in the 1960s . Now she coaches future teachers and advises half_a_dozen student clubs . In a school with a student body that includes 24 % Asian , 17 % Latino , 5 % black and 5 % Filipino , one of Swindell ' s five sophomore English_classes includes immigrants from Burma , Taiwan , Pakistan , Nigeria , Korea , Mexico , Romania , India , Samoa and the Philippines . They sit in a horseshoe , surrounded by posters praising racial unity , world peace and environmentalism . One front-row seat contains Sean Temple , a hockey lover whose writing shows sharp wit and intellect . Nearby sits Mike Caira , who flirts a lot with the girls behind him , then flirts_with Swindell to get_out of inevitable detentions . Then there ' s Brian Castles , a bright boy whose dad also teaches English at Kennedy . A gold &quot; Sweet 16 &quot; ring adorns one girl ' s hand . The hands of Kristin Jondle and Ronnie Ellision , a couple who do homework together , are usually intertwined . Quiet Kristen Vetica seems unmoved by the novel , but her journal reveals something else . To wake the students up one morning , Swindell asks each to name one of &quot; Ordinary People ' s &quot; many themes . &quot; I could use this novel for a whole year , &quot; she says . &quot; We could build a whole course on this , couldn ' t we ? &quot; In fact , Swindell ' s yearlong syllabus includes the requisite Shakespeare , Julius Caesar ; classic English-class tomes &quot; To Kill a Mockingbird &quot; and &quot; Lord of the Flies &quot; ; &quot; Fahrenheit 451 , &quot; Ray Bradbury ' s futuristic tale of book-burning ; Lorraine Hansbury ' s play , &quot; A Raisin in the Sun &quot; ; and &quot; Ordinary People. &quot; Some books are there for lessons in literary structure , vocabulary , character development , metaphor and narrative style . &quot; Ordinary People , &quot; she says , provides life lessons . They begin with the title . &quot; One of the things we ' re going to determine in this novel is that there is no such thing as ordinary people , &quot; explains the teacher . &quot; We ' re all ordinary , but we ' re all extraordinary in one way. &quot; Swindell knows that relatively few teens will lose a sibling to tragedy , but that most have trouble talking to their parents . Only a handful ever step inside a psychiatric_hospital , but all shudder before their first date and experience stress over extracurriculars . They ' ve lied to their parents , kept secrets , worried about the changes in their bodies . One morning , Swindell takes a poll : What are teens ' biggest problems ? Of 33 students in one class , 17 name drugs as their No . 1 worry . Eleven say sex . Parents : five . Violence : three . Depression : four . &quot; Peer pressure ? &quot; Swindell suggests . They all nod . Later , writing in the journals Swindell requires them to keep all year , the students list their personal troubles . Too young to drive ; too poor to afford auto insurance . There are divorce survivors and veterans of switching schools -- or switching countries . One boy lives here ; his parents work in Taiwan . A girl has an alcoholic stepfather . Another ' s mother &quot; works two jobs , and when she comes_home she sleeps . We don ' t have time for each other. &quot; A white student ' s mother won ' t allow her to date blacks . Another student ' s father doesn ' t allow dating at all . * &quot; To have a reason to get_up in the morning , it is necessary to possess a guiding principle . A belief of some kind . A bumper sticker , if you will . People in cars on busy freeways call to each other Boycott Grapes , comfort each other Honk if You Love Jesus , joke with each other Be Kind to Animals-Kiss a Beaver . They identify , they summarize , they antagonize with statements of faith. &quot; The students are lost in the opening passage , the opening pages . Guest confuses them by alternating narrators , switching between Conrad and his father from one chapter to the next . They hate Conrad ' s stream-of-consciousness blabber . Many cultural references seem dated -- they don ' t get_it . If they don ' t read the book , if they don ' t like the book , how will Swindell make her points ? A week passes , and half the class hasn ' t cracked a page ; the assignment calendar says they should be through Chapter 15 , but the students concede they are_on Chapter 3 , maybe 4 . Swindell keeps reading aloud , devotes a class to silent reading . Arms folded across his book_bag , Sean is silent but not reading . Instead , he stares at the guy next to him selling Blow Pops , at the girls across the room rubbing lotion on their hands , at the threesome in the corner passing prom pictures . Sean is an A student , but &quot; Ordinary People &quot; strikes him as , well , kind of ordinary . &quot; I guess it ' s worth reading , but I don ' t know if anybody in this class really wants to read &quot; anything , he shrugs . &quot; Most people are probably thinking it ' s kind of lame. &quot; Indeed , in early journal entries , most students seem less than enchanted with the novel . &quot; The book seems very boring , &quot; Brian Castles writes during the first week . &quot; It doesn ' t have any action , and all it does is tell about a boy ' s life. &quot; * Conrad is a very troubled boy , stuck_in a complicated life . He missed final_exams getting shock_therapy in the hospital , so now he ' s stuck_in junior_classes -- his friends are all seniors . He can ' t stand his once-beloved swim team ; it now reminds him of his dead brother . Worst of all , Conrad thinks his mother wishes he had died instead of Buck when the two brothers got caught in a storm while sailing . In class , Swindell harps on the family_relationships . One morning , the students sit with magic_markers and white_paper , brainstorming in groups , making lists of &quot; things that tear us apart as a family &quot; and &quot; what holds us together. &quot; Another day , the groups prepare skits depicting a typical day in the life of various stereotypical families . For the first major writing project in connection with the novel , each student interviews a relative , then writes an autobiographical family history . &quot; I want to learn more about your family , &quot; Swindell explains . &quot; I want you to learn more about your family. &quot; For many , it is the first time in awhile they have spoken_to their parents about school -- or about anything , really , beyond negotiating curfew or borrowing the car . A boy who failed English in the fall is the first to turn_in the essay ; his mother calls Swindell , jubilant , saying : &quot; My son actually talked to me about an assignment ! &quot; Another student writes 28 pages . Now they are_on Chapter 13 , the painful scene in which Beth confronts Conrad about having hidden his quitting the swim team . &quot; I ' m sure I would have told you , &quot; Conrad says , &quot; if I thought you gave_a_damn ! . . . You never wanted to know anything I was doing , or anything I wasn ' t doing ; you just wanted me to leave you alone ! &quot; The students grow quiet , reflecting perhaps on_their_own parental battles . &quot; I ' m lucky to have a mom who listens to me , &quot; one girl says . &quot; But I never thought she did until I read this book. &quot; * Kristin Jondle and Ronnie Ellison stride into class together , sometimes grab a smooch before the bell rings , then sit side-by-side in the back row . As the teacher talks , they hold hands across desks . She leans her head on his shoulder , fiddles_with his fingers . Their smiling eyes lock whenever Swindell talks_about Conrad and his girlfriend , Jeanine , whenever the classroom discussion turns_to dating and romance and sex . &quot; Conrad ' s head is_on his arm , one hand curved around her breast . . . . His heart floats inside his chest . His skin feels branded everywhere that she has touched him . . . . , &quot; Swindell reads from Chapter 30 as the nervous laughter and snickers begin anew . &quot; Gently , he asks her , because now he is her protector against the world , &quot; Did I hurt you ? &quot; Kristin and Ronnie have been dating about a year , and have not been involved sexually . Since reading &quot; Ordinary People , &quot; they ' ve been bugging Swindell and her boyfriend to join them on a double date . And the book has helped the young couple discuss sex in a new way , Kristin says . &quot; You need sex out_in the open . Teen-agers these days are more explorative , &quot; she writes in her journal . &quot; Parents don ' t want to talk_about it , so books or magazines are teen-agers ' only source. &quot; Chatting later , she adds : &quot; I ' ve tried to talk to my mother about it , but she graduated in ' 75 so she thinks totally differently ! &quot; Her own feelings are a bit conflicted . &quot; Sometimes I want to , but other times I think it ' s fine where it is right now , &quot; Kristin says one sunny day in the campus courtyard . &quot; Some girls that I know think ' I ' ve got_to do_it to be popular. ' Me ? I take no BS from Ronnie. &quot; She laughs . &quot; I ' ve seen a lot of movies and read a lot of books where girls who do_it , the guy leaves and that is the last thing I want. &quot; In the book , sex brings Conrad and Jeanine closer . Afterward , the young lovers lie_in bed , shyly sharing secrets : she tells of her parents ' divorce and a previous sexual encounter she regrets then , as she traces the scars on his wrist , he tells of his attempted suicide . * &quot; Suicide , &quot; a student calls_out , &quot; is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. &quot; They ' ve finished the book , and psychologist Sharon Garrett is visiting class for the day , trying to debunk some common myths . Like the notion that if somebody says they want to commit suicide , they ' re probably not serious . Or that once people try to kill themselves , they never get_over suicidal feelings . Or that suicide is random , arising without warning . &quot; I tried so many different things . Starvation , a blade , and other stuff , too , &quot; one student writes in her journal , recalling her own suicide attempts several years before . &quot; I even tried to overdose on Tylenol . I guess I just wanted attention , and I couldn ' t get any because of my attitude problem . &quot; To even think_about it now I feel so stupid . I ' m glad I didn ' t kill myself. &quot; Conrad seems glad , too , until he reads in the newspaper that a friend from the psychiatric_hospital has killed herself . Reeling with pain , the boy ' s thoughts race back to the boat accident , his bloody suicide attempt , and his long hospital stay . &quot; He walks swiftly , without direction . To calm himself . To get_away from dreams , because there are worse ones and he doesn ' t want to remember them , doesn ' t want to think at all , less intense , less intense , but how to do_it ? &quot; Kristen Vetica , a 15-year-old basketball star , gets glassy-eyed as Swindell reads the frightful passage . She ' s thinking_of her own friend , who shot himself to death as Kristen read the novel . &quot; There will always be somebody that was going_to commit suicide , and there ' s nothing that anybody can do about it , &quot; she sighs . &quot; If you don ' t talk to anyone and tell what ' s going_on then no one ' s ever going_to know how you ' re feeling inside. &quot; * All of a sudden , the students have gotten_into it . They carry to class anecdotes of family life , their own alienation , their curiosities about growing_up . Many who were bored and confused by the opening pages now gush about what they ' ve learned . Once put_off by the differences between ' 70s Midwestern suburbia and ' 90s Orange County , they now ooze with empathy for the protagonist . &quot; Finally a book we can relate to , &quot; says one girl . &quot; A book to help us understand we ' re not alone. &quot; Even Brian Castles , who lamented the lack of action , is converted . &quot; I ' ve learned that no matter what happens in my life , no matter how drastic , I will try to never blame myself for it if it wasn ' t my fault , &quot; Brian writes in his last journal entry of the &quot; Ordinary People &quot; unit . &quot; I also learned that stress can trigger big emotions in your life , and that committing suicide makes no help whatsoever. &quot; * Every day , Swindell wears an enamel red AIDS ribbon on her lapel . Last year , she marched in the Paris gay-pride parade . She ' s not afraid to make a statement . For her , the fuss over &quot; Ordinary People &quot; -- and , by extension , her class -- just offers a chance for another life lesson : Stand_up , speak out , do what you think is right . She ' s been teaching the novel for a decade , but now she ' s on the stump , talking_about censorship over breakfast at the Kiwanis Club , in her sermon at church , during her housewarming party . &quot; One reason I do_it is because so many teachers do not . They ' re embarrassed , &quot; she explains . &quot; I raised four boys. &quot; She laughs . &quot; I can ' t get embarrassed. &quot; Still , things get sticky . Mike Caira , a precocious student who gets good grades but doesn ' t like to pay_attention , asks permission one morning to use profanity for a classroom exercise about family . &quot; We need to , &quot; the boy says . &quot; Just a little bit , to get our point across. &quot; Holding up the book , Mike reminds the teacher how Guest employs racy language to make her characters more real , her story come_alive . &quot; How come they can but we can ' t ? &quot; Now Swindell is giggling , like the class did that first day when she read the text aloud . ' There ' s a difference , &quot; she says , shaking her head a firm &quot; no &quot; to Mike ' s request , &quot; between using it in a literary piece_of_work and using profanity to put people down. &quot; Nearly 20 years after it was published , author Guest is surprised that &quot; Ordinary People &quot; is still making headlines , especially for the language . &quot; The themes in the book are way more threatening than the language , &quot; Guest said of the book that earned a prestigious award for &quot; best first novel &quot; of 1976 . &quot; The process of ( Conrad ' s ) recovery is also the story of his autonomy , learning that neither of his parents are perfect , and learning that he can ' t keep living_by these rules that he doesn ' t believe_in , &quot; Guest explained . &quot; That is the kind of material that some people think is subversive and threatening -- you can cover that all by complaining about the language. &quot; What ' s Your Opinion ?

Voices / From Students ' ' Ordinary People ' Journals In class , the students were often quiet . But each day in their journals , they responded to the novel , relating its many themes to their own lives . What are the biggest problems teen-agers face ? Why do people want to ban this book ? Do you find the language in the book offensive ? Is life fair ? What is a dysfunctional family ? What did you learn from the novel ? Here are some of the students ' reflections : * &quot; Most teen-agers have something to do with drugs or sex , and the ones that don ' t want to do or talk_about either subject end_up being laughed_at or losing friendships because they choose to say no . . . . We are going_through a period_of_time when a lot of pressure is put_on us about just anything people can think_of , and this pressure doesn ' t always come from adults but from our own peers . It ' s a very confusing time because you ' re stuck_in between being a kid and an adult , and you don ' t know which way to go. &quot; * &quot; My number_one problem is my parents . I ' ve been a problem child for a long while . I ' ve been trying to improve , though , I really have , but my parents must_not see it . . . we don ' t tell each other our problems , which lead to more . All we do is argue until someone is hurt . We never talk things out. &quot; * &quot; I hate other stories that always use the same formula . They don ' t use the ' normal language. ' They stop when the story reaches the bad side of society or human_beings . I don ' t think that is a good way to write the story . The world is not perfect . We do not need to cover_up the bad side because we want to have a perfect world . Maybe the language is not necessary , but we cannot cancel all_the bad language. &quot; * &quot; I do find this novel rather strange and stumbling . Too_much profanity for my taste . And I don ' t understand where they are or where they came from . But I guess I will have to read more and understand it. &quot; * &quot; Teen-agers don ' t like to read fairy tales , they like to read the truth. &quot; * &quot; The book is confusing because what is ordinary people ? I have never heard the words ordinary people before . What is an ordinary person ? Is there really an ordinary person ? I hope to answer this question when I read the novel . . . maybe ! &quot; * &quot; I think all families are considered dysfunctional nowadays . No family is perfect . Because I know my family is dysfunctional . Actually , I don ' t know a functional family . But I think they should change the rating so that a normal family with normal problems should be considered functional. &quot; * &quot; People go_to parties , have fun , and sometimes get carried_away with things like drinking so they get drunk and vulnerable and then they ' re easy to take_advantage of , then they have_sex and , afterwards , when they ' re all sobered_up , they regret what they did and they ' re too ashamed to tell someone about it , so they feel down and depressed , like they ' ve been used for a good time and start taking drugs and others keep having one-night stands because that ' s what they feel is all they can get -- no relationship . So they get some kind of disease or even pregnant. &quot; * &quot; Sex becomes a big factor_in your life at this age . You want to be able to brag about it to your friends and to rub it in. &quot; * &quot; When do they think we should hear about teen-age suicide ? When we are adults it will be too late ! And the same with teen-age sex . It ' s very important that we talk_about it before we do things we might regret , which many kids have . Also , most teen-agers are having or thinking_about sex. &quot; * &quot; I learned that there is no such thing as an ' ordinary ' family . Everyone experiences problems and deals with them in their own way . Every family has feelings of guilt , loneliness , depression . Almost everyone experiences lack of communication , selfishness , family problems . I also learned you can ' t hold_in everything . You have to communicate with others , because it will come_back in your face or it will keep haunting you . Suicide is not something to joke about . You should take it like it ' s really going_to happen . It ' s the safer assumption. &quot; * &quot; It seems to me that parents don ' t understand teen-agers . It ' s like they were born parents and never were teen-agers. &quot; * &quot; I don ' t live with my mom because we don ' t get_along too well . With my friends , some act so stupid that I can ' t stand to be around them . I was seeing a psychiatrist , but my mom was having financial problems so she took me out . So for now , I ' m on my own. &quot; * &quot; One important element in keeping a family together is communication . Not only do families have to communicate , but they also have to get_along and respect each other . If the members of a family don ' t respect each other then , obviously , they would not get_along , which would eventually lead to not communicating. &quot; * &quot; My family has problems . Me and my dad are both stubborn and there really is no communication . A dysfunctional family is a family that doesn ' t talk at all and doesn ' t like to be around each other . All they do is yell and fight and argue . They avoid each other and don ' t eat together. &quot; * &quot; A good family is like the Brady Bunch . That is a perfect family . The Bundys are a dysfunctional family . My family is an in-between , nice and not nice . I am a Brady Bunch / Bundy family. &quot; * &quot; I feel I am a survivor . If something went_wrong in my life , I do feel I would be able to handle it . If there was a death in my family , of course , I would be sad and not know what to do . But some way , I know , I would still be able to go_on and be OK. &quot; * &quot; From this novel I learned that my own life isn ' t as bad as I thought it was. &quot; Book Battles People for the American Way , a liberal Washington-based public interest_group , has tracked censorship struggles in the nation ' s schools and libraries since 1982 .
