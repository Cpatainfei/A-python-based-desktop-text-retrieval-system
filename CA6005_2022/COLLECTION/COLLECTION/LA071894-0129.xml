   <TEXT> They loped off the field together , the old wolf and the young cub . The old wolf ' s mane was white . In his eyes , a tear or two might have glistened . Perhaps it was the memories that came flooding back , memories of 1958 , 1962 , 1970 and , now , 1994 . Or perhaps it was that his players , his beloved Brazilians , had just been tossing him into the air , not once , not twice or thrice , but four times , one for each World Cup he has won . And that sort of celebration takes some getting used to when you ' re going to turn 63 in three weeks . Thirty-six years after he starred as a left wing on Brazil ' s 1958 World Cup-winning team in Sweden , Mario Jorge ( Lobo ) Zagalo won the Cup for an astonishing fourth time Sunday , this time as Brazil ' s technical director . No one has done that before . Alongside padded the cub , christened Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima but already far better known simply as Ronaldo . Ronaldo is 17 and his proudest possession as of this morning is a World Cup winner ' s medal . Pele was 17 when he won his first World Cup . Ronaldo did not play in this tournament , but just as Zagalo represents Brazil ' s past , Ronaldo represents its future . Zagalo already had won two World Cup tournaments as a player and a third as Brazil ' s coach by the time Ronaldo was born in 1977 , but the youngster is being touted as the nation ' s next star . More_than 50 goals for Cruzeiro , his Brazilian club , have earned him that accolade . The weight of being the next Romario or Bebeto was not on Ronaldo ' s shoulders_in this World Cup . That will come later . For now , he was content simply to learn , to be part of the team , accepted well enough so that during Brazil ' s celebratory dances Ronaldo went_about smacking his fellow players with a large yellow balloon . The innocence is still there for Ronaldo . Innocence that was sadly lacking during a World Cup_final that , while incident-filled , never rose to any great height as a spectacle . The announced Rose Bowl crowd of 94 # 194 ( a highly suspicious total in a 1994 World Cup filled with too many heavy-handed public-relations gimmicks ) sat through two hours of defensive soccer . It was not boring -- there were too many fascinating one-on-one battles for that -- but neither was it exhilarating . This was a game for those who enjoy their soccer as played by Paolo Maldini , Franco Baresi , Aldair and Marcio Santos . All four were excellent , with Maldini enjoying the game of his life , especially once he had been restored to his usual left-back position . Baresi , who is not quite as old as Zagalo but probably felt_like it by the end of 120 exhausting minutes , was equally superb . Between them , and with significant help from the relatively inexperienced but astonishingly composed Antonio Benarrivo and Luigi Apolloni , they completely nullified the twin threats of Romario and Bebeto . At the other end of the field , Aldair and Marcio Santos , dealt equally capably with the disappointingly rare Italian offensive forays . Roberto Baggio , Italy ' s great hope , was hobbled by a hamstring strain and was never able to escape the attentions of Mauro Silva . It added_up to a frustrating afternoon for both teams ' attacks , and it was hardly surprising that it finally required penalty kicks to tell world champion from runner-up . Parreira did what he had promised . Despite intense and ugly criticism of his team ' s style , he brought the Cup back to Brazil . More_than that , the fans cannot ask . &quot; Parreira is a good coach , but he doesn ' t have any luck , &quot; a Brazilian journalist said before the tournament . &quot; Zagalo is not a good coach but he has good luck. &quot; Together , they made the perfect combination . Brazil is now holder of three world championships , having won the Under-20 World Championship in Australia last year as well as the FIFA Five-a-Side ( Indoor ) World Championship in Hong Kong , also last year . The Brazilian team that defeated Ghana in the Under-20 final in Sydney is light_years removed from Parreira ' s side . It played the way Zagalo used to , full of flair and imagination , with surprises around every corner . It is the team Ronaldo now can join for the next Under-20 World Cup , in Nigeria next year . And if the young cub is wise , he ' ll find a way to take the old wolf with him . Just for luck .</TEXT>
