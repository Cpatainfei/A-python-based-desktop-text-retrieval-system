   <HEADLINE> THE LOST FAITH OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN ; THE CEREBRAL LIBERAL ' S PIVOTAL CHANCE TO SHAPE SOCIAL_POLICY COMES AT A TIME WEN HE CONFRONTS DOUBTS THAT HE -- OR ANYONE -- CAN SOLVE AMERICA ' S PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one who was in the Cabinet Room on that fall morning could have known it then , but they were witnessing the last time that John F . Kennedy would publicly exercise what the civics books say is the most basic and important power of a President -- signing a bill into law . Called the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 , it embodied all_the optimistic and confident new thinking that Kennedy and his youthful Administration had brought_to Washington . The appeal of this particular legislation had been irresistible , even to the conservative Southern warhorses of Capitol_Hill , who had blocked most of Kennedy ' s other social initiatives that year . This was the plan : An enlightened and compassionate nation would clean_out the crowded warehouses that had held the retarded and the mentally_ill in a 19th-Century nether world of darkness and isolation . Science had opened the way with miraculous new drugs that reclaimed wasted minds . Now , government would do its part by building places where those people could find treatment and begin productive lives . &quot; The mentally_ill and the mentally_retarded need no longer be alien to our affections or beyond the help of our communities , &quot; Kennedy said . &quot; I think that in the years to come , those who have been engaged in this enterprise can feel the greatest source of pride and satisfaction. &quot; One who was there to hear those words was a relatively unknown 36-year-old assistant secretary_of_labor . He worshiped this President , and though he would later serve in more exalted positions for three other chief_executives , he would look_back and write : &quot; Kennedy had been ' my ' President in a way that happens only once. &quot; His President even gave him one of the fountain_pens with which he had signed the bill . Nestled on red velvet , it is framed_in gold with a card inscribed : &quot; This pen was used by President Kennedy in signing Public_Law Number 88-164 , October 31 , 1963 , and presented to Daniel P . Moynihan. &quot; Three decades later , that pen hangs_in the conference_room behind the Senate Finance_Committee chamber . In that proverbial back_room , the committee that many consider the most powerful in Congress will give shape to the heart of President Clinton ' s domestic agenda : health_care and welfare reform . To Chairman Pat Moynihan , the pen is no mere souvenir . He believes that it set into motion a national tragedy . The asylums emptied out , but the government never built the 2 # 000 community_centers that were supposed to be in place by 1980 ; it stopped at a woefully short 482 . And as a result , the deinstitutionalized mentally_ill were literally left_out in the cold . They were free all_right , Moynihan has said . &quot; They might henceforth sleep_in doorways as often as they chose . The problem of the homeless appeared , characteristically defined as persons who lacked ' affordable housing. ' &quot; The cautionary tale of the pen , then , is that not even the smartest , most well-meaning people can anticipate all_the consequences of their actions . Its moral is that , trying to solve one problem by dismantling the system that surrounds it may sometimes produce only a different kind of misery . Many social_scientists would disagree_with Moynihan ' s analysis that the complex problem of homelessness can be blamed on that single piece of legislation , but there is no doubting the New York Democrat ' s conviction . &quot; It ' s been absolutely catastrophic , &quot; he says , &quot; a tribute to ignorance and all that is wrong , and it would never have happened if we hadn ' t set_out to improve things. &quot; &quot; If we hadn ' t set_out to improve things . . . &quot; Moynihan tells the story so often that some senators are beginning to find it tiresome . It bears repeating here , because it begins to explain the reading of history that shapes Moynihan ' s fears for the future . It helps explain the things about Moynihan that are often written_off as eccentricity or whimsy : the penchant for launching verbal neutron_bombs at the Clinton team ; the fits of pique that have strained his relationship with many of his Democratic colleagues ; the reluctance to write a health-care bill , despite enormous pressure from the White_House and Congress ' Democratic leadership . To some , it seems that Pat Moynihan is standing_in the way of his President and of his party . &quot; He is brilliant . He is extraordinary in his breadth and depth of knowledge on issues , but it ' s difficult to take that knowledge and experience and create a leadership role out of it , &quot; says one senator . &quot; He is less than successful in presenting solutions , whether it ' s health_care or welfare reform. &quot; Moynihan comes_into this enormous power at a time when his party -- the Democratic Party that he will proudly tell you is the oldest political organization on earth -- has its first chance in more_than a decade to change the direction of the country . Yet he finds himself isolated among his party ' s liberal leaders , holding to the sensibilities of another era . &quot; Moynihan represents the now-forgotten complex liberalism of the 1950s , &quot; says historian Fred Siegel , a fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute , which calls itself a New Democratic think_tank . &quot; The liberalism since then has been , by and large , enthusiastic in a religious sense , and simple-minded . That older liberalism was cerebral , contemplative , more aware , in the wake of the disasters of totalitarianism , of how difficult it is to change people without creating ugly side effects. &quot; Moynihan , says Siegel , is &quot; not just skeptical of bureaucracy . He ' s skeptical of the capacity of social_work to replace the family , and he ' s been proven right. &quot; Today , as people ask Pat Moynihan for the answers , this man who has been so certain about so many things seems to be able to say only that he does not have them . He does not believe anyone else does either . He has power now . But what does that mean when one has lost his confidence in what government can do -- or worse , his faith in what it should do ? His instincts and his experience seem to be telling him to be wary of grandiose schemes that wrap themselves in the banner of liberal activism . But any Democratic politician must also understand that squeamishness now could mean a historic opportunity missed . A close friend puts it this way : &quot; I think Pat is struggling with these two sides of his political being . The two sides of his nature -- the intellectual side and the political side -- grind like tectonic plates right along a fault_line . He manages as well as he can. &quot; GIVEN THE HOLD OF THE SENATE FINANCE_COMMITTEE OVER SO_MUCH that is dear to Clinton , it is not surprising that White_House officials are not particularly eager to criticize the chairman on the record . But the way in which they refuse to comment is telling in itself . &quot; Why add where there ' s problems aplenty ? &quot; one normally chatty aide snaps , hastily hanging_up the phone . Moynihan originally regarded Clinton as the best thing to happen to the national government since Kennedy . As a candidate , the Arkansas governor had sounded many of the themes that Moynihan had been preaching for years -- ideas such_as personal responsibility and a rejection of the notion that more government spending was the answer to every social problem . &quot; I have to say I like the idea of a 46-year-old governor coming_to Washington with a zest for new ideas , &quot; Moynihan wrote his constituents shortly before the presidential election . &quot; It is just possible that we are going_to see one of those periods of high energy here in the national government . Anyone who was here in Washington during the Kennedy years will never forget them. &quot; It must have seemed to Moynihan that Clinton could be the President who would bring the Democrats out of the ideological wilderness where they had been wandering since Jimmy_Carter . And perhaps his infatuation might have continued and grown , had lightning not struck . As one senator -- albeit one who was a member of the Finance_Committee -- he could have continued to play his roles of gadfly and sage , without challenging the Clinton agenda . But when Clinton decided to tap Finance_Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen to be his Treasury_secretary , by virtue of seniority , Moynihan moved_up to assume the leadership of one of the most headstrong committees on Capitol_Hill . Suddenly , Moynihan ' s ideas counted . There were more_than a_few whispers that Moynihan might not be up_to the job he inherited from the cool , patrician Bentsen , who had run the committee with the grip of a board chairman . At 67 , and approaching the end of three terms in office , Moynihan still seems the flighty Harvard professor , his limp white forelock flying as he lopes onto the Senate floor to deliver his lectures . If the question of the moment is the Mideast peace process , Moynihan launches into the division of the Ottoman Empire after World_War I ; if it is economics , he explains the calculations that go_into determining national_income . His vision and insight are undeniable . When his peers were still celebrating the victories of the civil-rights marchers in the South , he was pointing to the North , to the cities where the black family was losing its battle to a more intractable enemy . When America was stockpiling arms for the ultimate nuclear clash , he was a decade ahead of events with his prediction that the Soviet_Union would kill itself . When Ronald Reagan incited Republicans and Democrats to a bidding war to see who could cut taxes faster , it was Moynihan who foresaw the resulting deficits that could cripple government for generations . &quot; He ' s a man who has seen many disasters , &quot; says historian Siegel . &quot; If you were going_to sum_up the tragedy of Pat Moynihan , it ' s that he ' s a man who saw much better than those around him , but nonetheless hasn ' t been able to stop the course of history. &quot; Moynihan ' s personal creed is the_French Catholic novelist Georges Bernanos ' observation that the worst , most corrupting lies are problems poorly stated , and for all these years , he has been trying to help explain what is wrong . But chairmen of important congressional committees are judged not on how well they understand problems ; they are expected to know how to fix them . Over the years , Moynihan had come_to be regarded by colleagues as their in-house intellectual , one whose ideas were intriguing , but rather off the mark politically . His legislative skills were largely untested , with a massive 1991 surface transportation bill being the only major legislation that he had ever steered through a difficult floor fight . And there was always the question of his drinking . In Washington , Moynihan has a reputation as a lush , which is reinforced by the perpetual flush of his cheeks and an odd manner_of_speaking that is somewhere between a splutter and a lisp . Of all_the raps against Moynihan , this is the one that annoys his admirers the most . &quot; He drinks much less than I do , and has for a long_time , &quot; says Washington super-lawyer Leonard Garment , an old friend . &quot; He couldn ' t do the things he does , and has done . He couldn ' t write a book every summer . It ' s all so silly , that business as if he is Mr. Hiccup. &quot; From the start , it appeared that the Clinton White_House was ready to dismiss Moynihan as a legislative lightweight . Indeed , through the transition and the early weeks of the Administration , neither the President nor any of his top staffers even bothered to get_in_touch with the new chairman of the most pivotal committee in Congress . More important , it seemed to Moynihan that the Clinton team was giving short_shrift to welfare reform , an issue he cares about over all others . During his campaign , Clinton had vowed to &quot; end welfare as we know it. &quot; Once he was elected , however , it quickly became clear that welfare reform would take a back seat to health_care , a topic in which Moynihan had never evinced much interest . His mounting irritation boiled_over the week before the inauguration , when Donna Shalala , Health and Human Services secretary nominee , focused_on health to the virtual exclusion of welfare at her confirmation_hearing before Moynihan ' s committee . Setting what was to become the tone for his relations with the new Administration , Moynihan made the devastating suggestion that he could hear &quot; the clatter of campaign promises being tossed_out the window. &quot; After Clinton was in office , things got_worse . An unidentified official at the White_House suggested to Time magazine columnist Michael Kramer that Moynihan did not have a grip on the Finance_Committee , and added : &quot; He ' s not one of us . . . . we ' ll roll right over him if we have to. &quot; Yet when the time came last year for his first big test as chairman , Moynihan delivered the votes to keep Clinton ' s economic plan alive . Even then , however , there were whispers that it was actually Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell of Maine who had done the heavy lifting , and the White_House privately blamed Moynihan , though perhaps unfairly , for losing its proposed BTU tax . Moynihan ' s relationship with the Clinton_Administration hasn ' t jelled into anything that resembles trust or comfort . &quot; He drives the White_House nuts , &quot; groans one Democratic congressman . &quot; They have no idea where he ' s going_to come from hour to hour , day to day. &quot; Moynihan was the first Democrat to support the appointment of a prosecutor to look_into the Whitewater affair . He said that the Administration policy on Bosnia is &quot; shredding the entire legal order that we put into place at the end of World_War II. &quot; He described Clinton ' s tepid statements on welfare reform as &quot; boob bait for the bubbas. &quot; But none of Moynihan ' s comments have been as damaging as the ones about health-care reform . His word for Clinton ' s financing scheme was &quot; fantasy. &quot; The First Couple ' s apocalyptic rhetoric , he suggested , was hype : &quot; We don ' t have a health-care crisis in this country . We do have a welfare crisis. &quot; Moynihan even threatened to hold health_care hostage unless he saw some action on welfare reform , and the President had no choice but to pay the ransom . The White_House went_to work_on a welfare proposal , despite warnings from others in Congress that it risked throwing the lawmaking machinery into overload . Now it appears that Congress will not take a serious look_at the issue until next year . Over and over , Moynihan pushes the button that plunges the White_House into the spin cycle . Administration officials clench their teeth , face the cameras and suggest once again that the chairman ' s complex views can easily lend themselves to misinterpretation . As much a part of the ritual are the chairman ' s practiced expressions of bewilderment that anything he has said could have created such a fuss . For , after all , Moynihan insists , he was only stating the obvious . Equally apparent to Moynihan is the need to bring Republicans -- and specifically their leader , Bob Dole -- into the action on health_care . Working with only a two-vote Democratic majority on the Finance_Committee , Moynihan knows that if even one on his side bolts , he loses . And looking ahead , the fight on the Senate floor would be easier if he could claim that he has bipartisan support . &quot; This bill is going_to be a bipartisan bill . Any bill that drives_off all_the Republicans , save one or two , also scares_off at least 10 Democrats , &quot; says Sen . Bob Packwood ( R-Ore. ) , a good friend of Moynihan and a former Finance_Committee chairman himself . As the chairman finds growing support and admiration from Republicans , he is becoming increasingly isolated from his own party . In a recent speech , Sen . John D . ( Jay ) Rockefeller IV ( D-W.Va. ) , a Finance_Committee member and one of Clinton ' s most ardent health-care allies , warmly praised fellow Democrats who have not &quot; dodged the bullet. &quot; Notably absent from a list that included all_the major Democratic players with jurisdiction over health_care was Rockefeller ' s own chairman -- Moynihan . It was only one more sign that Democratic leaders are doing their best to steer as much of the health-care action as possible away from him . His first setback came when Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and a champion of health-care reform since the 1970s , refused to cede the entire bill to the Finance_Committee . Although the White_House was rooting for Kennedy , Clinton pointedly stayed outside what amounted to a nasty family fight . Indeed , the turf battle over health_care has sorely strained the relationship between Moynihan and the brother of the President he so admired . At the final moment before the bill was formally introduced last year , Kennedy prevailed through his superior mastery of the complicated Senate rules , leading Moynihan to threaten to publicly denounce Kennedy and to label the Clinton health plan a huge tax increase in disguise . ( Kennedy and Moynihan ' s staff_members deny that such an episode occurred , but sources from the White_House and Capitol_Hill insist that it did. ) Unable to bring Moynihan under_control , Majority_Leader Mitchell was forced to abandon his plans to make a splashy event of the formal introduction of the biggest piece of legislation since the Great Depression . He submitted the bill to the Senate parliamentarian late on a weekend night , marking the occasion with only a written statement for the Congressional Record . Since then , the efforts to cut Moynihan out of the action have only intensified . Behind the scenes , some Democrats have formed a private network that has been meeting feverishly . Not that he would care . Moynihan and his alter_ego , Chief_of_Staff Lawrence O ' Donnell Jr. , rarely show_up even for strategy sessions at the White_House . &quot; I ' ve never been to a meeting in Washington outside the Finance or Ways and Means conference_rooms that involved more_than three people and accomplished anything , &quot; O ' Donnell told National Journal magazine . Mitchell , also a member of the Finance_Committee , is taking greater command . Having announced that he will retire at the end of this year , Mitchell wants to end his Senate career with a victory that will be regarded_as nothing short of historic . He even turned_down a chance at the Supreme Court so that he could devote his energies to seeing this bill through . The tensions are evident . On one April weekend , Mitchell gathered his Democratic troops in Virginia for an in-depth discussion of their options on health reform . Right up until the last minute , sources say , it was unclear whether the Finance_Committee chairman would even participate . At a subsequent closed-door luncheon where Mitchell presented Democrats with another set of health-care choices , Moynihan put_in an appearance , then left after only a_few minutes -- ensuring that reporters , to whom he selectively doles_out interviews ( he would not grant an interview for this story ) , would note his exit . Meanwhile , Kennedy was working behind the scenes with Mitchell and the White_House to produce his own health-care bill . Weeks before Moynihan ' s committee had even had its first official vote on the bill , Kennedy ' s was_well under way . But it would be folly to believe Moynihan will not have his day . &quot; They will not run_over Pat . If this becomes a head-to-head battle , Pat will win , &quot; Packwood says . &quot; I get awfully tired_of people who underrate Pat. &quot; TO CHALK_UP ALL THESE EPISODES TO MOYNIHAN ' S CANTANKEROUSNESS IS to ignore his personal history -- a political evolution that has often been_well ahead of his party and of American society itself . &quot; We ' re getting_up on 40 years of high-level public_service , and he hasn ' t forgotten a minute of it , &quot; says James Q . Wilson , UCLA professor of management and public policy , who has known Moynihan almost that long . When politics and expediency would dictate that he move one way , Moynihan can be expected to go the other . He went right when the country moved left in the 1960s , and headed the other way with Ronald Reagan ' s election in the ' 80s . Time has often proven that his vision was truer than that of those around him , but vindication has not come without cost . Moynihan has never really recovered from the most searing experience of his life : the backlash against his now-famous March , 1965 , report to President Lyndon B . Johnson on the Negro family . &quot; The United States is approaching a new crisis in race relations , &quot; the assistant labor_secretary wrote in the Moynihan Report . It proceeded to paint ghetto family life with a litany of brutal statistics that today have grown to staggering proportions : broken marriages , illegitimate births , households headed by women , drug_addiction , unemployment , poverty . Others had seen these problems as well , but Moynihan was the first to wrap them in data -- and more important , the first to try to force a national policy debate over them . It was , he wrote later , &quot; the best work I had ever done , or would do. &quot; Yet the reaction was hardly what Moynihan had expected . Writer Nicholas Lemann has noted in his book on black migration to the North : &quot; Because Moynihan had left_out the solutions , and because the press had concentrated_on the parts of the report that dealt with out-of-wedlock childbearing and ignored the parts about unemployment , it was possible to perceive it as a brief for doing nothing to help the black poor . . . because the straits they were in were of_their_own devising. &quot; Boston psychologist William Ryan leveled the most stinging description of what Moynihan had done , the label that would stick : &quot; blaming the victim. &quot; An embittered Moynihan returned to New York , lost a race for City_Council president and retreated to a teaching job at Harvard . He blamed the liberals for what had happened to him . Not his kind of liberal , of the more cerebral , more contemplative , more subtle tradition . He blamed the kind of liberal who had come_to populate the New Left , whose power he said was &quot; as rigid and destructive as any force in American life. &quot; The Moynihan Report and its fallout represent &quot; a seminal moment in the decline of American liberalism . It was at that moment that liberalism began to substitute pieties for problem-solving , &quot; says historian Siegel . It was also the moment that it became apparent the once-comfortable label of liberal would never fit Moynihan again . It would appear that his ideology is a moving target , but it is more likely that he ' s simply outpacing the rest of the country . In 1979 , the Nation magazine called his &quot; the conscience of a neo-conservative , &quot; but when that movement was at its zenith two years later , the New Republic was featuring &quot; Pat Moynihan , neo-liberal. &quot; &quot; Pat has always been what you might call a revisionist progressive , &quot; says the neo-conservative guru Irving Kristol , who has known Moynihan since the 1950s . &quot; He comes_out of the progressive Democratic movement in New York City , and he ' s always thought of himself as progressive . On the other hand , he ' s been involved in government long enough to be disillusioned with a lot of things government tries to do. &quot; The Moynihan Report was only the first of his bitter battles with the left . To the horror of his liberal friends at Harvard , Moynihan returned to Washington to join the Administration of Richard M . Nixon . His title was assistant to the President for urban affairs , a sort of domestic version of Henry Kissinger . Once again , a memo that he wrote to the President touched_off a firestorm -- this one including a widely misinterpreted recommendation that the Administration abandon its confrontational approach to racial issues and instead assume a posture of &quot; benign neglect. &quot; To Moynihan , it seemed that it had become impossible to engage in any kind of discussion that involved race . &quot; A certain kind of liberal conviction fixed on this issue , &quot; he recalled . &quot; The Administration was irredeemably damned , and so was I. &quot; On that score , it would seem that Moynihan might have found a political soul_mate in Bill_Clinton , who two decades later ran as a &quot; New Democrat , &quot; repudiating much of what the liberals in his party had come_to represent . But Moynihan cannot help but hear echoes of that older version of party dogma in those who populate the Administration and the programs they bring before his committee . Both First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Shalala had been leaders of the Children ' s Defense Fund , which unsuccessfully fought his welfare reform legislation in 1987 . That law was the most far-reaching overhaul of the welfare system in half a century , and included work-training requirements for welfare recipients as well as tighter enforcement of child-support orders . Presumably , it should form the basis for the next wave of welfare reforms . But Moynihan has little confidence in how the Clinton team will build_on his earlier work . Last month , he told New York magazine : &quot; Half the people they appointed had opposed the Welfare Reform Act of 1988. &quot; It is_on welfare reform that Moynihan sees the deepest betrayal of liberalism by liberals . He still carries the scars he suffered from his fight during the Nixon years for the Family Assistance Plan . &quot; It was one of the worst disappointments of his life , &quot; says Maura Moynihan , his daughter . The idea of the Family Assistance Plan was a radical one -- giving government money outright to families , rather than pouring it into their communities or providing them an array of government services . It was a remarkable thing to have persuaded a Republican President to support , but then , Moynihan had a special way with Nixon . For all their ideological differences , the President and his urban affairs adviser found a bond in the struggles and humiliations of having grown_up poor . Late afternoons often would find Nixon and Moynihan chatting in the Oval Office . Moynihan shared and nurtured Nixon ' s vision of leaving a social legacy that would be compared with that of the 19th-Century Tory statesman Benjamin Disraeli . In his memos to Nixon , Moynihan would paint every important policy decision as one on which history would be made . Later , Moynihan would say that Nixon was &quot; the most civil man I ever worked for. &quot; Moynihan blamed the liberals in Congress for blocking the Family Assistance Plan -- not because they believed it was flawed , but because they wanted to deny a Republican President the credit for bettering the lives of the poor . Garment , then counsel to the President , remembers going_with Moynihan to Capitol_Hill when the legislation was losing steam , and Nixon seemed prepared to give it one last push . Again and again , lawmakers of the left asked them : &quot; Why should we give this to Richard Nixon ? &quot; &quot; We saw the arrogance of power in very concrete terms , &quot; Garment says . &quot; It was really , truly despicable. &quot; While Moynihan defended the concept for years , experiments in the 1970s showed that giving people money actually contributed to the breakup of families . That , too , is a lesson that he carries into the issues he faces today . &quot; He knows we don ' t know what to do . He knows we don ' t know how to remake a broken family , or prevent a teen-age girl from becoming a mother . He knows we do not know how to end welfare dependency at some humane price , &quot; says one friend . &quot; Yet , he is required to act_as if he knows . You can ' t say as a senator -- much less as a chairman of the Senate Finance_Committee -- that we do not know how to do these things , and therefore , we shouldn ' t do anything. &quot; FOR MOYNIHAN , THE PROBLEMS of the welfare system illuminate a far deeper source of this nation ' s social deterioration -- the vast and growing number of fatherless families . &quot; There is one unmistakable lesson in American history : a community that allows a large_number of young_men to grow_up in broken families , dominated by women , never acquiring . . . any set of rational expectations about the future -- that community asks_for and gets chaos , &quot; Moynihan wrote in a magazine_article several months after his infamous report to Johnson . Though he likes to discuss the problem in terms of data and trends , Moynihan ' s experience with the broken family is far more personal . His own father -- a publicist with a fondness for drinking , women and racetracks -- abandoned the family when Pat was 10 , and his eldest son never saw him again . Moynihan does not like to talk_about the more intimate experiences of his childhood . Even his daughter , Maura , says she doesn ' t know the full story . &quot; He never dwelled_on it , &quot; she says . &quot; He ' s never been into being a victim. &quot; But there survive some glimpses of how deeply it affected him . Political consultant Douglas Schoen opened a 1979 biography of Moynihan by quoting something the future senator wrote when he was about 22 : &quot; I ' ve lived much of my life in a jungle of broken families , watching them tear out each other ' s minds , watching them feasting on each other ' s hearts. &quot; Margaret Moynihan and her three children bounced from one spot to another , hitting bottom in the brawling waterfront section of Manhattan known as Hell ' s Kitchen . As a youngster , Pat shined shoes around Times Square . He recalls hearing about the first major news_event of his life , the bombing of Pearl_Harbor , from a man whose shoes he was shining on Central_Park West . His mother married several times , in vain hope of finding financial security . Ultimately , she bought a saloon , where Pat could often be found tending the bar . As a teen , he also worked several months as a stevedore . Moynihan has claimed that he never seriously considered going_to college , and insists he took the City College entrance exam &quot; only to prove to myself that I was as smart as I thought I was. &quot; In a 1966 interview with the New York Times , Moynihan -- then at Harvard -- related : &quot; I swaggered into the test_room with my longshoreman ' s loading hook sticking_out of my back pocket . I wasn ' t going_to be mistaken for any sissy college kid . But I passed the test and decided to go_to City -- and that was the beginning of a lot of things in my life. &quot; The tale may have a bit of embroidery around the edges . In researching the biography , Schoen discovered that Moynihan was never required to take an entrance exam at City College , although he did have to pass one a year later to get_into the Navy ' s officer training_program . Navy training took him to Vermont ' s Middlebury College , where he ran with a group of rich kids . He graduated with a BA from Tufts University in Boston on the GI Bill . At 23 , he won a Fulbright Scholarship that took him to England and the London School of Economics . He wanted to go_into the foreign service , but the man who would be ambassador to India for Nixon and the United Nations for Gerald R . Ford ( and editor- or author-to-be of 16 books ) flunked the composition portion of the exam . So he found his way into state_government and the administration of New York Gov . Averell Harriman . It was while working for Harriman that he met Elizabeth Brennan , whom he married in 1955 . A secretary , she worked alongside him in an office outside Harriman ' s . Liz , an accomplished architectural historian , has run her husband ' s campaigns and is his closest adviser . They have three grown children . Since 1963 , the family home has been Pindars Corners , a town that is little more_than a traffic_light in Upstate New York . At Derrymore , their farm , the bookshelves by his bed are jammed with German , French and Italian volumes . Moynihan ' s idea of a vacation is to go_to an old schoolhouse on the property and spend at least six hours a day writing his books on a 25-year-old electric_typewriter . THESE DAYS , HOWEVER , Moynihan ' s chances to retreat to his typewriter and his world of ideas are fewer . For in the intellectual ' s heart there lives a street pol -- more particularly , one who is seeking reelection this year . Watching Moynihan on the stump is to be reminded that he got his first lessons in politics during the waning days of New York ' s Tammany_Hall clubhouses . In late March , hundreds of Upstate New Yorkers jammed into the fire_station of the little town of Chatham to let their senator hear their concerns firsthand . With delight , Moynihan pointed_out that one of his questioners had been his insurance_agent for more_than 30 years and that another had been a colleague from his days in the Harriman Administration . When one elderly woman said she was fearful that federal subsidies for her retirement home would be cut , he assured her : &quot; we ' ll find_out about this , and it won ' t happen. &quot; &quot; I think you ' re wonderful , &quot; she sighed . He took pains to assure his constituents that , despite his leadership role in health-care reform , he would defend his home-state interests . &quot; My concern in this bill is , first of all , to look_after New York , &quot; Moynihan said , adding that the ultimate legislation would reverse some of the old Medicaid formulas that have worked in favor of the South at the expense of northeastern states , and would protect big teaching hospitals and research_centers . But the professor in Moynihan kept creeping_in as well -- often to the obvious mystification of his audience . When one questioner asked about his comments critical of health-care reform , Moynihan quoted Bernanos ' theory about problems poorly stated , and pleaded guilty . When another asked about drug policy , he noted that the Harrison Act of 1914 had described heroin as a stimulant . And , of course , he told the story of the Kennedy pen once again . In his reelection bid , Moynihan is being challenged in the September primary by the Rev . Al Sharpton , a flamboyant black activist whose name is almost as well known as Moynihan ' s in New York City . ( The Republican candidate is Bernadette Castro. ) No one gives Sharpton much of a chance of winning , but he has succeeded in reviving the tensions between Moynihan and blacks that have never been far from the surface . A significant number of the state ' s black and Latino elected officials have endorsed Sharpton , saying Moynihan has long neglected them . Indeed , some say , when they want something done for them in Washington , they go_to their Republican senator , Alfonse D ' Amato . &quot; We do not need an academician . We need a fighter , and Moynihan is not a fighter , &quot; Sharpton says . &quot; Any time a man is unchallenged , and can sit around writing books more_than legislation , then he becomes a captive of_his_own academic world of theory , rather than the practical world that his constituents have to live in. &quot; THE DOMAIN OVER WHICH MOYNIHAN reigns is an uncomfortably chilly , muted green chamber where 20 white_men sit in a semicircular dais and face a table of witnesses under the glare of television lights . Since September , a procession of experts -- ranging from Hillary Rodham Clinton to her nemeses in the medical and insurance industries -- have argued their views here in 31 hearings on health-care reform . This , in many ways , was the Socratic Moynihan at his best and his most comfortable . As he explored the failings of the current system , the chairman also made_sure that his committee took_note of the fact that American medicine has a record of breathtaking achievements as well -- a single set of anti-peptic acid drugs , for example , that has dramatically reduced the need for surgery . And at almost every session , he found a way to work in the most famous advice attributed to Hippocrates , the Greek physician of antiquity : First , do no harm . One of the final hearings was_on May 10 , and fittingly , it brought the chairman back to_the_point where , for him , the entire debate had started . The subject was deinstitutionalization and mental_health , and , for the occasion , Moynihan had taken the gold frame down from its spot of honor on the wall of the conference_room , and brought it into the chamber . Waving it above his head , he launched again into his tale of remorse -- &quot; a reminder of the cost of good intentions . To make great changes is to invite large disturbances . We would hope we would be a lot more careful in this health legislation than we were a generation ago. &quot; Tellingly , Packwood and one other Republican were the only Finance_Committee members there to hear it . Not a single Democratic colleague had bothered to show_up . They probably knew he would start in again about that pen .</TEXT>
