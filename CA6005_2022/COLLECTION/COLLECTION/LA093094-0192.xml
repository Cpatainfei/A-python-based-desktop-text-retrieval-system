   <HEADLINE> EASTERN EUROPE ; FORMER SLOVAK PREMIER GETS BACK IN THE RING ; VLADIMIR MECIAR ' S PARTY IS FAVORED IN ELECTIONS TODAY AND SATURDAY . THE EX-BOXER ' S POPULIST MESSAGE STRIKES_A_CHORD IN HIS ECONOMICALLY TROUBLED NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can listen to his theme_song on the radio , drink his personalized brand of coffee and gaze at his grinning mug on billboards across the country . Vladimir Meciar is back . Two years after whipping_up a nationalist fervor that swept Czechoslovakia off the map , the heavyweight boxer-turned-politician is mounting a political comeback -- leaner by about 50 pounds but still very much a cagey , determined fighter . Voters cast ballots today and Saturday for the first time since the breakup of the former Czechoslovak Federation , and opinion polls show Meciar ' s Movement for a Democratic Slovakia , which engineered the split , favored by more_than a quarter of expected voters . His closest challenge comes from a coalition of parties dominated by ex-Communists , with 16 others lagging behind . Just six months ago , Meciar was nearly written_off as a political has-been when he was ousted as prime_minister by the Slovak Parliament and his own political_movement began hemorrhaging . A group of Meciar foes -- including defectors from his own party -- formed a new government and called early elections in the hope of winning public support . Instead , the elections have opened the door for the resurgence of the pugnacious former prime_minister , who has become the biggest campaign issue in a country beset with some of the toughest economic problems in Eastern Europe . &quot; People are overwhelmed by the problems , and they are looking_for optimism , &quot; said Viliam Sobona , Meciar ' s campaign manager . &quot; They need a man who is smiling and will lead them from their problems. &quot; Pumped by a rich campaign chest and the populist street smarts of advisers from Forza Italia , the party of Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi , Meciar has traveled the country preaching his &quot; Vivat Slovakia &quot; message . His rallies offer cheap beer , free goulash and a patriotic program intended to seize upon fears of the poor , the elderly and the uneducated about the dizzying changes under capitalism . Meciar has promised to cut taxes , increase retirement_benefits , create jobs and slow Slovakia ' s already snail-paced selloff of state enterprises to foreign investors . He has hinted that he will try to remove President Michal Kovac , whose harsh appraisal of Meciar last spring was said to have inspired the rebellion that toppled him . Meciar ' s opponents say his government was riddled with corruption , and they describe him as dangerously xenophobic and ultra-nationalistic . Critics fear his victory would bring instability to a country already perceived as reluctant to shed its Communist trappings . Slovakia ranks near the bottom of Eastern European_countries in attracting foreign investment and only just began mastering some of its economic problems with the arrival in March of Prime_Minister Jozef Moravcik ' s government . The governing coalition has won a loan from the International Monetary Fund , has aggressively begun selling state-owned enterprises and recently received a letter of praise from President Clinton . &quot; In our first election as an independent country , we will decide between a policy of confrontation and a policy of cooperation , &quot; said Milan Ftacnik of the Party of the Democratic Left , the former Communists in the ruling coalition . Meciar ' s party is expected to draw the most votes , but too few to form a government . If the broad-based opposition -- an improbable jumble encompassing former Communists and the religious right -- wins a plurality , it could continue governing . But if the opposition falls_short , virtually any combination of parties is possible -- with the most likely scenarios teaming Meciar with the former Communists or the Christian Democrats . Both parties say they would not join a Meciar-led coalition ; pragmatism , though , may ultimately prevail . &quot; Slovakia needs a government , &quot; said Juraj Kohutiar of the Christian Democratic Movement . &quot; Even a bad government is better than no government. &quot; Dean E . Murphy was recently on assignment in Bratislava , Slovakia .</TEXT>
