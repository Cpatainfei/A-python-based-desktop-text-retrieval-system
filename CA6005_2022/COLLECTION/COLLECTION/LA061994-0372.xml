   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : POWERFUL BOND MARKET IS_DUE FOR A REALITY CHECK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suddenly , something called &quot; the bond market &quot; has become a bogyman , said to be exerting a baleful influence on national policy and holding_back economic_growth lest inflation increase . A hot new book on the Clinton_Administration , &quot; The Agenda &quot; by Bob Woodward , reports that the President was surprised and angered to learn upon taking_office that the success of his economic program hinged_on financial markets or , as he is quoted , &quot; on the Federal_Reserve and a bunch of ------- bond traders. &quot; The book suggests that Clinton would have boosted the economy , accelerating job creation , were it not for fears that bond traders would send interest_rates skyward . Wall_Street exhibits similar fears today . The bond market ' s reactions to economic_growth last week were credited or blamed for stock prices rising or falling . But it ' s all half-truths and nonsense , akin to ancient Romans consulting chicken entrails and dreams to predict the future . Commentators in our own day have previously focused_on the money_supply , unemployment statistics , the behavior of Japanese or Arab investors to explain and predict the giant U.S. economy . What is seldom said is how often such indicators , which depend_on context and interpretation , can be wrong . Caesar ' s wife , Calpurnia , troubled by a dream , warned Julius not to go_to the Senate on the Ides of March . But soothsayers called her dream a positive indicator , so Caesar went and was killed . Today bond traders are pushing_up interest_rates on fears of rising inflation and are said to act like a throttle on growth and job creation . But that interpretation ignores several realities : that evidence of inflation in the real economy is debatable ; that the bond market itself is partly distorted by trading in derivatives , and , most important , that the long-term outlook for the real economy is for disinflation and rising productivity , a reality the bond market seems to miss . What ' s the relation of the bond market to the real economy ? That of a banker to a business owner . What we call the bond market represents the worldwide trading of government and private debt , including roughly $ 4 trillion in U.S. Treasury_bills , notes and bonds . Bond investors , including your pension and mutual_funds , literally are lending money . So traders strive to keep interest high enough that inflation doesn ' t erode principal . By doing so , they affect global interest_rates , including the rate for your mortgage or personal_loan . But that doesn ' t mean that every nick in interest_rates stops a growing economy . Your mortgage and credit_card debt doesn ' t limit what you can earn , after all , though making payments limits what you can spend . In the 1980s , economic_growth ranged from minus 2 % in the recession to 6.2 % in 1984 and back to 2.9 % in ' 86 . Yet mortgage rates stayed above 10 % throughout the decade , according to statistics compiled by Advisers Capital Management , a New York-based investment_firm . Now mortgage rates are at roughly 8.3 % , the economy is growing at more_than 3 % and housing starts are strong . No obstacle to growth in those statistics . The inflation fears that have driven markets recently are centered_on industrial commodities such_as copper and other metals , which have risen in price from depressed levels . But that ' s looking_at &quot; the old industrial model , &quot; says Charles Clough , chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch . He means that those commodities feed manufacturing industry , which is 20 % of the economy . that ' s important , sure , but concentrating_on commodities , the bond traders are overlooking other evidence -- such_as that H.J. Heinz and other consumer goods companies have recently had to call_off attempted price increases . Also , there is abundant capital in banks , with no pressures on credit , and companies such_as McDonald ' s , Coca-Cola and Toys R Us are using surplus capital to buy their own stock . That means they see no surging demand to open new stores or build new plants , and no investment looks better than their own companies -- which , like most U.S firms , have grown extremely efficient . And that brings_up the true liberating and encouraging outlook for the economy . The service_industries -- transportation , communications , retailing , financial and business services , even medical services -- are showing gains in output without rising costs . Productivity , in a word . A revolution in_services has been building for years as more_than $ 200 billion has been invested in computing and telecommunications , notes economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley . Now the promise of all that investment is being realized . And that means the long-term outlook in the service sector , which accounts_for two-thirds of U.S. economic output , is for rising productivity and disinflation . The Clinton_Administration understands this . The Council of Economic Advisers last week issued a study on the effects of phone deregulation on the telecommunications and computing industries . They projected a great flowering , with growth of 2 million telecommunications-related jobs by 2003 . Telecommunications and computing , the study found , would then compose more_than 18 % of the U.S. economy . Communications will far surpass automobiles as the biggest employer . Will that be inflationary ? On the contrary , it will be efficient and disinflationary -- while creating jobs . And that outlook argues for low interest_rates and strong bond markets . Make no mistake . We will still have problems to solve : education , poverty , race relations . But the bond market won ' t stop anybody from innovative solutions on such issues . Also , the world changes . The old-fashioned way to boost the economy was by pumping in public spending . But that is not what Clinton ' s economic advisers are touting today . Rather , deregulation and industrial efficiency are seen as the real way to create 2 million jobs . A revolution is occurring here . Does the bond market know this ? Shouldn ' t it ?</TEXT>
