   <HEADLINE> FIRST ELECTRIC_LIGHTS COME TO REMOTE EGYPTIAN VILLAGE BY WAY OF THE SUN ; POWER : GOVERNMENT INSTALLS PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS IN PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO DESERT DWELLERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The flat blue-and-white panels atop the sand-colored Bedouin houses look totally alien in the stark landscape of this tiny desert village . But they have catapulted its inhabitants into the 20th Century . The tribal life , little changed for centuries , has been given a jolt -- solar_energy technology has brought electricity for the first time . &quot; It is as though we were dead and have become alive , as though we were buried under the ground and have been dug_out , &quot; said Karima Senoussy , her brightly embroidered robe contrasting with a wizened face bronzed by the scorching sun . For the village ' s 450 residents , the fluorescent lights with white plastic shades mean they now stay_up at night seeing friends and relatives . They talk_of buying a television but have yet to realize what other changes might come . They have a battery-powered radio now . Electrification of the Western Desert village 100 miles northwest of Cairo is part of a project that the government hopes can be expanded to dozens of other remote villages . Most of Egypt ' s 58 million inhabitants have electricity , especially along the Nile and the great river ' s delta , generated by power_plants fueled by natural_gas and by hydroelectric stations . But the government is looking_for other sources to meet the combined problems of rapidly increasing population , decreasing natural_gas and petroleum resources , and rising pollution . Solar energy is_on the top of the list . &quot; Solar energy technology has expanded tremendously , and the price of the units is becoming more affordable , &quot; said Maher Abaza , Egypt ' s minister of electricity and energy . He said a study found that it was cheaper to provide desert villages like Awlad el Sheik with photovoltaic_cells , which transform solar rays into electricity , than linking them to the main power_grid . The use of solar_energy in Egypt dates_back to the 1970s when the American University in Cairo used Bassaissa village in the Nile delta as a prototype for fostering development through natural_resources . Salah Arafa , a physics professor at the university who helped start the project , stressed that solar_energy was feasible only in rural_areas with unfettered access to the sun . High-rises in cities_block the light . He said money was needed to spread solar_energy , and recommended that Egypt subsidize solar as it does conventional electricity . &quot; Since solar_energy is the future . . . we should have a long-term financing system , &quot; he said . Government officials have not said how much would be spent on solar_energy . In Awlad el Sheik , which means &quot; children of the sheik , &quot; a German grant is helping finance electrification . Twenty of the village ' s 40 houses got rooftop solar_panels in September . The families paid 105 pounds ( about $ 30 ) for each unit and were told they would have to pay more later , but the government has not said how much or when . The long-term effect of electricity on their primitive life is still unclear . Mud-brick houses replaced their tents in recent years , but the floors are still sand . Furniture is minimal ; the villagers sit and sleep on handmade carpets . With water available only from a well 2 1 / 2 miles away , the women do not dream of washing_machines . And with kitchens consisting_of outdoor mud-brick ovens , refrigerators and toasters are a world away . But the 62-year-old village head , Abdel-Wanees Breik , said electricity already has changed their lives . &quot; We used to sleep shortly after sunset , &quot; he said . &quot; Now that we have electricity , we stay_up late and visit with the neighbors who are all cousins. &quot; The villagers are shepherds , like their forefathers . They live_on the meat and milk of camels , cows and sheep . The women use wool from the animals to weave colorful carpets to supplement family incomes . A 12-year-old named Nagwa said she enjoyed playing into the night with friends under the village ' s eight new street lights . But she added : &quot; We still get_up early to tend to the animals. &quot;</TEXT>
