   <HEADLINE> FAA CONSIDERED EFFECT OF 757 RULING ON BOEING SALES ; AVIATION : PERCEPTION OF FIRM WAS WEIGHED , DOCUMENTS SHOW . AGENCY OFFICIAL SAYS DISCUSSION WAS APPROPRIATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal Aviation Administration officials were concerned about the economic well-being and image of the Boeing company when they pondered whether to adopt measures to prevent accidents caused by potentially deadly wake turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners , internal documents show . In January , as the FAA was deciding what to do about 757 turbulence after the phenomenon had been linked to two fatal crashes , agency officials expressed concerns about how new safety measures would affect sales of the popular , fuel-efficient jetliner . &quot; It is probably desirable to coordinate with Boeing before this change is made , &quot; the agency ' s then-chief scientist Robert E . Machol wrote_on Jan . 12 , referring to a proposal to require smaller planes to stay an additional mile behind 757s on final approaches . &quot; It could have an adverse effect on the sale of 757s , and while I am not a lawyer I suppose there is even some possibility that they could sue us. &quot; On a list of pros and cons drawn_up in an analysis of possible consequences of the FAA ' s taking action , a Jan . 25 chart lists as a con &quot; Boeing ' s perception. &quot; Contained in thousands of pages of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , the references involving Boeing raise questions about a commonly leveled criticism that the FAA sometimes favors the well-being of the industry over public safety in its decision-making process . Deputy FAA Administrator Linda Hall Daschle said Wednesday it was &quot; appropriate &quot; for the agency to seek_out all sides of the issue . &quot; That is what due_process is all about , &quot; Daschle said . &quot; What would be inappropriate , &quot; she said , would be to give greater weight to Boeing ' s view , and &quot; that was not done. &quot; Boeing communications manager Jerry Johnson said Wednesday that he had not seen the documents and therefore could not comment on whether it was appropriate for the FAA to consider Boeing ' s interests in a safety matter . &quot; The FAA is the one that determines the regulations , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; Safety is first and foremost our greatest concern on any issue. &quot; Machol , who retired as FAA chief scientist April 30 , said Wednesday that he had expressed concern about the possibility of Boeing suing the FAA because he &quot; thought it was a consideration. &quot; Machol emphasized that he did not intend to suggest that Boeing be allowed undue influence over the decision-making process . &quot; I know there ' s a feeling out there that the FAA doesn ' t consider safety , &quot; he said . &quot; The truth is we try to get_along well -- and we do get_along well -- especially with Boeing. &quot; Released this week over objections from some within the FAA , the previously undisclosed documents also indicate : * Beginning as far back as 1988 and continuing until recently , Boeing had lobbied against increased spacing for aircraft_landing behind 757s even though aviation officials had pushed for such a measure in the interest of safety . * The FAA ' s Flight Standards Office recognized that there was something unique about the 757 ' s turbulence as far back as 1987 . In addition , in April , 1988 , the Air Line Pilots Assn . red-flagged the issue in a letter to the FAA and formally requested that the agency test the sleek-bodied 757 to determine why pilots were reporting that it seemed to produce much stronger wake turbulence than other airplanes in its weight class . An earlier set of FAA documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act suggested that the agency had only become aware of the 757 phenomenon in mid-1990 . The FAA never responded to the pilots association letter or its request ; the kinds of tests it sought are under way . * Concerns within the agency about its image , the threat of lawsuits and airport capacity appeared , at times , to eclipse concerns about safety . &quot; We really have very little choice on this , &quot; Machol wrote_on Jan . 14 , a month after five people died in Santa Ana when a corporate jet encountered 757 wake turbulence , and 13 months after a similar crash in Billings , Mont. , killed eight people . &quot; We are under pressure from the media. &quot; The FAA ' s Daschle said perception is a legitimate part of the decision-making process , especially on controversial issues . * Although some FAA officials believed that action was unnecessary , others noted the organization ' s lack of response on the 757 issue . Referring to a list of safety concerns and recommendations promulgated by Machol in October , 1992 -- before any of the fatal_accidents -- one unidentified official scribbled on a route slip : &quot; Shouldn ' t we urge / promote implementation of those ( recommendations ) we know he ' s right on , and sponsor research where questions remain ? &quot; I ' m a bit nervous just ' sitting ' on this stuff , &quot; the official wrote . In February , air crew program manager Glenn Holmbeck wrote to the Office of Accident Investigation in the Recommendation and Quality Assurance division : &quot; Daily , we are risking the traveling public by not addressing the B-757 wake turbulence problem . &quot; Any good safety program has got_to be proactive ( preventive ) , not reactive . Our customers are the traveling public ( taxpayers ) , who pay our salaries and not the industry that we are supposed to be regulating. &quot; The revelations have surfaced after an internal review that concluded that the FAA may have mishandled reports that 757s cause unusual turbulence , and that the agency should view the 757 issue as a &quot; wake-up call &quot; to reform the way it handles potential safety hazards . A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take_up the agency ' s handling of the 757 issue today , as well as the larger issue of the agency ' s ability to identify and act_upon safety concerns . Only after five incidents , including two that claimed 13 lives , did the FAA institute measures designed to prevent accidents caused by 757 turbulence . Announced by FAA Administrator David R . Hinson in May , the new program includes an aggressive education requirement for pilots and air traffic controllers , and a requirement that smaller planes flying under instrument flight rules -- those being guided by controllers -- remain four miles , instead of the standard three miles , behind 757s during landings . Pilots flying under visual flight rules , which generally call_for the pilot to determine how closely he or she follows a leading plane , are urged to keep the longer distance . Although officials disagree on the level of danger , the 757 ' s smooth body and wing design appears to make_it capable of producing unusually potent wake turbulence -- volatile funnels of air with hurricane-force winds that emanate from each wingtip . The FAA has concluded that until recently there was insufficient evidence to make any changes relating to 757s , and that nothing it could have done would have prevented the 13 fatalities . &quot; The reality , &quot; Daschle said , &quot; is that up until ( a recent crash in ) Charlotte , you had 27 months where more_than a_billion people flew without an accident involving a major commercial airline. &quot; The FAA for years has resisted efforts to call attention to the 757 issue or increase separation distances because it could potentially decrease the number of flights at major airports , which could cut_into airline revenues . By law , the agency is bound to promote the airline industry and ensure safety -- missions that many believe are contradictory . Daschle acknowledged that the FAA ' s twin responsibilities sometimes put it in a position of asking itself some hard questions , but she maintained that the agency performs both tasks well . &quot; We have been able to accomplish the job that Congress gave to us , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve seen more occasions where safety has come first. &quot; Among other things , the newly released documents indicate that Boeing has been involved in the 757 decision-making process from early on , and that FAA officials were sympathetic to how the controversy would affect the company . The papers include : * A handwritten report indicating that Boeing officials participated in a wake turbulence meeting in January at which it was decided that the FAA should &quot; avoid &quot; characterizing the wake turbulence hazard as a problem associated with a particular plane , such_as the Boeing 757 . * An October , 1992 , memo from Anthony Broderick , the FAA ' s associate administrator for regulation and certification , saying : &quot; We will most certainly antagonize Boeing by moving their ' large ' B-757 into the ' heavy ' or some special weight category. &quot; Broderick was referring to the weight classification scheme used to determine landing distances between planes . Some safety experts have said the 757 , now classified as &quot; large , &quot; belongs in the &quot; heavy &quot; category , which would mean that smaller planes would have to stay five or six miles back instead of four miles .</TEXT>
