   <TEXT> Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette would like to get_rid_of all team nicknames and start over : &quot; When is the last time you saw a panther , except in a zoo ? What is a Buckeye ? A Hawkeye ? A Nittany Lion ? A Hoya ? Why should we care ? With a modicum of effort we could replace the whole tired lot . &quot; Give me nicknames with relevance now . I yearn to see the New York Muggers take_on the Washington Tax and Spenders , no matter what the sport. &quot; Add nicknames : Toronto ' s new NBA team will be called the Raptors , a shortened version of the name for the velociraptor dinosaur in the movie &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; The team ' s logo will be a snarling dinosaur dribbling a basketball . A dinosaur dribbling ? Trivia time : How many times have the Dodgers played the New York Yankees in the World_Series ? Twin Towers II : Remember when Hakeem Olajawon and Ralph Sampson of the Houston Rockets were called the Twin Towers ? Well , Sammie and Simeon Haley , 7-foot identical_twins , have announced they intend to play_at the University of Missouri . Tee tied : Pro golfer Billy Mayfair and his longtime girlfriend Tammy McIntire were recently married near the 18th green of the Four Seasons / Tournament Players Course in Las Colinas , Tex . &quot; We ' re going to be spending the rest of our lives on a golf_course , &quot; Mayfair said . &quot; We thought we might as well be married on one. &quot; Eloquent : In replacing &quot; Raider &quot; with &quot; Skyhawk &quot; as the school ' s new nickname , President Joel M . Jones of Fort Lewis College in Durango , Colo. , said : &quot; The skyhawk is a powerful image in flight -- the symbol of our efforts to conduct our daily lives from the higher plane of vision and understanding. &quot; Ageless ace : At 81 and with failing eyesight , Philip Lopiano no longer can see the pins . It didn ' t matter . Lopiano recently got the third hole in one of his 66-year golfing career . All three aces have come_on the par-three 17th at Glen Brook Country_Club in Stroudsburg , Pa . Naughty , naughty : When the Chicago Blackhawks played their final game in Chicago Stadium , a woman tried to steal the door off the women ' s rest room in the second_balcony . She was caught and stadium officials made her put it back . Easy sell : Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News : &quot; Headline : ' George Foreman Talked Out of Retirement. ' Whoo boy . Bet that took some talking . Like two words , one of which was four and the other , million. &quot; Trivia answer : Eleven times . Quotebook : Whitey Herzog , former St . Louis Cardinal manager , on playing in Candlestick Park : &quot; Sitting in the dugout is like sitting in the bottom of a toilet . All that tissue blows in , and no one flushes it. &quot; MAL FLORENCE</TEXT>
