   <HEADLINE> MANDELA BEGINS SHAPING NEW GOVERNMENT ; SOUTH_AFRICA : SLOW VOTE COUNT DELAYS NEW PRESIDENT ' S FORMAL ELECTION . GORE WILL LEAD U.S. DELEGATION AT INAUGURATION TUESDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President-elect Nelson Mandela began shaping South_Africa ' s first post-apartheid government Tuesday , but his formal election in Parliament will be delayed three days because of the glacially slow counting , by hand , of millions of paper ballots from last week ' s all-race elections . Mandela , who claimed victory Monday night and led the nation in a night of rejoicing , met privately early Tuesday with the lame-duck white president , Frederik W . de Klerk . Aides said they discussed who will be in the 27-member Cabinet that their parties will dominate in the so-called government of national unity . The cheering crowds that shot guns and fireworks in the air , lit bonfires and danced in the streets of major cities and black townships were largely gone_by dawn , and most people returned to work . Police said little violence or vandalism had occurred as the jubilant black majority celebrated the end of white domination . The immediate concern was finishing the vote counting in time for Mandela ' s inauguration next Tuesday in Pretoria . Vice_President Al Gore will lead the American delegation , the White_House announced , and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton may attend as well . Other expected guests include U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Britain ' s Prince Philip , Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and leaders of more_than 20 countries from Israel to Pakistan . After four days of counting , just over half the expected 23 million ballots were tallied by Tuesday night . Overwhelmed election officials blamed logistic and communication problems , as well as scattered cases of fraud , as the ballots were slowly counted and recounted at 1 # 200 stations across the country . In some areas , counting has yet to begin . In others , many of the teachers and bank tellers hired as official counters had to return to their jobs Monday , leaving tallying posts unfilled . And at other stations , disputes arose over the use of party supporters to handle ballots . Pay strikes were reported at several stations . As returns trickled in , the Independent Electoral Commission decided to bend its own rules to quicken the pace . The commission scrapped its required safeguard that officials verify that the number of ballots returned to counting stations matched the number of ballots handed_out . The outcome was not in doubt , because Mandela ' s ANC appeared headed for a landslide victory . With 53 % of the vote counted , the ANC led with 62.5 % , followed by De Klerk ' s National Party with 22.1 % . Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi ' s Inkatha Freedom Party was a distant third with a better-than-expected 8.3 % , and the right-wing white Freedom Front had 2.7 % . The white liberal Democratic Party had 1.7 % ; the radical black Pan-Africanist Congress had 1.3 % . A total of 27 parties ran . Under the law , the electoral commission must finish the counting and decide whether the election was &quot; substantially free and fair &quot; by Monday , 10 days after polls closed . The approval is considered a formality -- even though election abuses , including stolen ballots and ballot_boxes , now appear to have been widespread . The commission received thousands of complaints and has referred more_than 150 cases to police for investigation . But with time running_out , the multi-party Transitional Executive_Council , which has overseen the government since December , delayed the opening of the new 400-member National Assembly , the main chamber of Parliament , from Friday until Monday . The assembly ' s first official act will be to elect Mandela as the country ' s first black president . The executive_council also delayed seating of nine new provincial legislatures . They will convene Saturday , rather than Thursday , and will elect a 90-member national Senate . &quot; The only date that seems cast in stone is the inauguration on Tuesday , because of the invited guests , &quot; said Dries van Heerden , executive_council spokesman . Under the law , any party that wins more_than 5 % of the popular vote may claim a seat in the new Cabinet . So far , only the ANC , National Party and Inkatha have broken that threshold . But Mandela has said he may invite leaders of other , smaller parties to join , especially from the Pan-Africanist Congress and the Freedom Front . Despite problems during the election , former Jamaican Prime_Minister Michael Manley , head of the Commonwealth election observer group , said Tuesday that the abuses did not undermine the result . &quot; People had a chance to vote , they did vote and were able to make a choice , &quot; he told a news_conference before leaving the country . U.N. Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria had a similar assessment , saying , &quot; We are satisfied that the people of South_Africa were able to participate freely in the voting. &quot;</TEXT>
