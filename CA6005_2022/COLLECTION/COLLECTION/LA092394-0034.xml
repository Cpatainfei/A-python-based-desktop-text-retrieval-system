   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION ; LATINOS WANT A TIGHTER BORDER , TOO ; THE FLOOD OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HURTS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY , WHICH NOW MUST DO WHAT GOVERNMENT WON ' T .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I am a Mexican American . I have proudly served my country in two wars , and there are millions more like me . We are proud that our country ' s immigration laws are far more generous than those of Mexico or any other place in the developed world . But we are also proud that we are a nation of laws , which means respect for laws , including those we may_not like . And illegal immigration is just that : illegal . It is a crime . To condone , encourage , perpetuate or defend it is unconscionable . To aid and abet it is equally illegal . It is one thing to break a country ' s laws when fleeing from persecution or when your life is threatened . It is a totally different matter_to break the law and hope to profit . It is one thing to petition your own government for fair treatment . It is quite another to make demands on a foreign government and its taxpayers when you have illegally rushed across its borders . And it is a horrible thing to start your life as a would-be American as a criminal . This has nothing to do with race . If Latinos are caught more often , it is because they illegally cross the border more often . Most of the Anglos I work with on Proposition 187 , the &quot; save our state &quot; initiative , would feel exactly the same way if the border invaders were Canadians setting_up camp in Montana and hollering for freebies . We take the position that the state of California can no longer be the Department of Health , Education and Welfare for the rest of the world . What ' s interesting in this debate is the opinion of other Latinos . Maria Enchautegui , who has conducted immigration studies for the Urban Institute , acknowledges that &quot; Hispanics are affected most by immigration . Hispanics compete more with new immigrants than do white and black Americans . They feel the negative effects more. &quot; Dallas Morning News columnist Richard Estrada says : &quot; The rank_and_file Hispanics were far ahead of other Americans in_viewing illegal immigrants as economic and even social threats . . . because the effects of immigration have manifested themselves first and foremost in Hispanic communities of long standing. &quot; The respected magazine Hispanic says : &quot; There is an ironic inconsistency in the U.S. Hispanic community . On the one hand , Hispanic_Americans have become subjects of an anti-immigration backlash , while on the other , the majority opposes current levels of immigration . Up to 84 % say there are already too many immigrants coming_into the United States. &quot; Hispanic ' s report was based on the Latino National Political Survey , which , the magazine said , is considered the most sweeping measure to date of Latino opinion on social and political topics. &quot; The poll sought a response to the statement , &quot; There are too many immigrants. &quot; The following agreed or strongly agreed : Cuban Americans , 66 % ; Mexican Americans , 75 % , and Puerto Ricans , 79 % . Surprisingly , non-citizens agreed or strongly agreed in larger percentages : Cubans , 73 % , and Mexicans , 84 % . Some self-proclaimed Latino leaders insist that passage of Proposition 187 will cause Latinos in_general to be suspected , rightly or wrongly , of being illegal residents . Quite the reverse . The hostile tactics of those fighting the initiative , the boast by many Latinos that &quot; we won ' t overcome , we will overwhelm , &quot; and the encouragement of young Latino hotheads to take_back the Southwest , Texas to California , by armed force , can only lead Americans to suspect all Latinos of being a potential fifth_column . California ' s middle_class , the main backer of Proposition 187 , seems caught between the Mexican and U.S._governments . While proponents of an open border say that there is no way to close it ( so relax and enjoy it ) , either government , if really determined , could shut it down in a month . Working together , if they had a will , they could do_it in three days . Why don ' t they ? Because illegal immigration has become a big business , with the local taxpayer bearing the costs . It provides a pressure valve for Mexico , so instead of caring for its own people , Mexico ships them north . Our paralyzed legislators don ' t fight , acting like deer transfixed in headlights . Our $ 2-an-hour &quot; employers &quot; welcome it ; it ' s the next best thing to getting workers free . Drug abusers need it ; the coyotes carry their mail . And so it goes , on and on and on , like the Energizer Bunny .</TEXT>
