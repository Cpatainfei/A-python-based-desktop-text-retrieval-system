   <HEADLINE> HIKING : OLYMPIC NATIONAL_PARK : WINDFALL OF BEAUTY ATOP HURRICANE RIDGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mile-high Hurricane Ridge , perched on the northern edge of the Olympic Mountains in western Washington , offers postcard panoramas of Olympic National_Park , as well as the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Vancouver Island . Road access to the national_park from the north_side is limited to just two roads , one of which -- Hurricane Ridge Road -- is a scenic gem . The wide road begins at Port Angeles and winds around Mt . Angeles . In the late 1950 ' s , park administrators had the foresight to close the last mile and a half of the road to auto traffic and convert it to a footpath , making an easy and inspiring hike . Another hike for the heartier , an 8 1 / 2-mile round-trip ascent of the 6 # 454-foot Mt . Angeles , begins from a trail head at the Hurricane Ridge parking_area . The first stop for park visitors and prospective Hurricane Ridge hikers should be Pioneer Memorial Museum , Olympic National_Park ' s main interpretive center . The museum is located on Hurricane Ridge Road on the outskirt of Port Angeles . It is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily and is free . Directions to trail head : From U.S. 101 in Port Angeles , drive 17 miles up Hurricane Ridge Road to the road ' s end at the Hurricane Ridge parking_area . The hike : The signed Hurricane Hill Trail ascends through meadowland and occasional clusters of subalpine_fir . You ' ll spot some delightful picnic spots near the top of the 5 # 640-foot hill . On top , unfold your park map and look_for Mt . Constance and Mt Anderson far to the southeast , as well as other mighty snow-capped Olympic peaks . Just down below , 10 miles to the north , is Port Angeles ; 20 miles farther , across the Strait of Juan de Fuca , is Victoria , British_Columbia . In the blue distance are the San Juan Islands . Hurricane Hill Trail WHERE : Hurricane Ridge , Olympic National_Park . DISTANCE : 3 miles round_trip with 800-foot elevation gain ; longer hikes possible .
