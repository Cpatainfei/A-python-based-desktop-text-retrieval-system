   <HEADLINE> BIOTECHNOLOGY WINS ROUND IN FIGHT ON DRUG PRICE_CONTROLS ; MEDICINE : FEDERAL COST REVIEW PANEL MAY BE DROPPED FROM HEALTH_CARE PLAN . RESEARCH INVESTMENT IS SEEN AS ENDANGERED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The biotechnology industry has achieved an important step_in fighting proposed federal drug price_controls that it contends would cripple research on &quot; breakthrough &quot; drugs . In a meeting with industry leaders from California and other states , President Clinton ' s top health policy adviser indicated that the Administration will not oppose in Congress the industry ' s efforts to keep drug price restrictions out of federal health_care reform legislation , industry leaders said Wednesday . The statements , from White_House adviser Ira Magaziner and other administration officials , was &quot; the most encouraging news we ' ve heard in a long_time , &quot; said Lisa Conte , chief_executive of Shaman Pharmaceuticals , a South San Francisco biotechnology firm . The biotechnology industry has been lobbying hard to persuade the Clinton_Administration to drop two proposals from its health_care bill that would broaden government powers to oversee drug prices . The industry has warned that such proposals could cripple investment in the capital-hungry industry , forcing biotech firms to abandon research into drugs to fight cancer , AIDS and other illnesses . Conte said Magaziner , in a meeting Monday , &quot; made_it clear that this is a battle that needed to be fought &quot; with Congress , while indicating that the Administration would be willing to drop the drug price provisions if they became a sticking point in the health_care debate . The Clinton proposals at_issue include a government advisory council that would review breakthrough drugs and rule on the &quot; reasonableness &quot; of their prices . Another would allow the secretary of Health and Human Services to exclude new prescription_drugs from the Medicare program should their prices be deemed excessive . The issue is critical to California ' s biotechnology companies -- concentrated in the Bay Area and San Diego County -- which account_for 40 % of the industry ' s 95 # 000 jobs . Last month , Rep . John D . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , wrote Rep . Lynn Schenk ( D-San Diego ) that he would back her efforts to scrap the advisory council -- a move that encouraged the biotechnology industry . David Beier , vice_president of government affairs for San Francisco-based Genentech , said the meeting with Magaziner touched_on a number of issues besides reforming the medical_care system , among them exports , intellectual property protection and research and development tax_credits . Others at the meeting were Kirk Raab , chairman of Genentech , and Gordon Binder , chief_executive of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen . &quot; All along , the Administration has said it wanted to encourage innovation yet contain costs , and they came_up with one way of doing that , &quot; Beier said . &quot; The essential message they were giving the group is that Congress is revisiting that issue , and if they came_up with another way of ( containing costs ) , then that ' s fine with them , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
