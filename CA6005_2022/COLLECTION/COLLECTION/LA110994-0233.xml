   <HEADLINE> BITTERLY FOUGHT SENATE_RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s bruising and costly U.S. Senate contest between Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein and Republican challenger Mike Huffington was coming_down to the wire late Tuesday as results indicated the race was still too close to call . Feinstein , who was outspent by more_than 2 to 1 overall and as much as 3 to 1 on television , watched the returns from her home_in San Francisco . The former mayor , who was scheduled to appear later in the night at the Fairmont Hotel , was described as &quot; optimistic &quot; about the outcome and &quot; relieved this race is over. &quot; &quot; We are confident we are going_to win . . . but this is a very close race that is going_to be decided late into the night , &quot; said Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata . &quot; Dianne is going_to win by a narrow margin. &quot; Huffington , meanwhile , also remained out_of_sight at an Orange County hotel where his campaign had planned to share an election night party with the sponsors of Proposition 187 . The Republican candidate spoke briefly with reporters when he arrived_at the hotel shortly after the polls closed . &quot; My wife and I are very relaxed , &quot; he said . &quot; Has it been worth it ? &quot; one reporter asked . &quot; It ' s been very worth it , &quot; the candidate answered . &quot; All of us are_on this planet to do_good for somebody. &quot; Huffington , whose fortune came from the 1990 sale of his family ' s Texas oil and gas_company , also seemed to reflect on polls taken shortly before the election that indicated most California voters do not know or do not like the Republican nominee . &quot; I want ( voters ) to get_to know me , &quot; he said . &quot; You can ' t do_it in a 30-second spot . It ' s going_to take six years for them to get_to really know me and my family. &quot; Huffington ' s wife , Arianna , an internationally known author , also said of the acrimonious and cliffhanging campaign : &quot; Maybe there ' s a book in it . I ' m keeping notes. &quot; Feinstein , who rode a Democratic momentum into office in 1992 , the so-called &quot; Year of the Woman , &quot; found herself two years later paddling against a powerful political current . Feinstein ran a campaign about the benefits of government that contrasted with the hostile mood responsible_for the historic gains in Congress for Republicans . In addition , political observers said Feinstein suffered from the poor showing by Democratic colleague Kathleen Brown in the governor ' s race , and she was hurt by her opposition to Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration initiative . Huffington , however , spent so_much of the campaign attacking Feinstein that polls indicated he never made a strong connection with voters . In addition , his campaign was rocked by press stories critical of his business background , his wife ' s unconventional religious history and , most recently , his admission that he employed an illegal immigrant in violation of federal law . The two Senate candidates combined to spend more_than $ 41 million on the race , shattering a 10-year record of $ 26 million set by North Carolina Sen . Jesse A . Helms and his opponent . Huffington , whose fortune comes from the 1990 sale of his family ' s Texas oil and gas_company , accounted_for almost $ 30 million , nearly double the most ever spent by a non-presidential candidate . Because of his money , Huffington turned the California race into a high-stakes cliffhanger after it had been considered by most Washington insiders to be one of the surest Democratic bets in the country . Feinstein was an early favorite because she was a veteran of two consecutive statewide campaigns and , in polls , she was rated the most popular politician in California . But after Huffington spent nearly $ 6 million on television advertising during the spring , most of it attacking Feinstein ' s record in the Senate , the incumbent ' s lead shrank_from 30 % in a Times Poll in March to single digits by the June 7 primary . The developments set_off alarms at the White_House because Huffington ' s primary criticism of Feinstein last spring was her vote for President Clinton ' s 1993 economic package . By late May , Feinstein had also quietly dropped her name from a list of senators backing the President ' s health_care plan . Still , Feinstein maintained a cautious alliance with the President throughout her campaign . Clinton appeared four times with Feinstein , including two early fund-raisers and two events in the last month . In June , just days after the polls found the race tightening , Feinstein responded with her first television commercials . But after a summer-long exchange of high-priced attack ads , the polls did not budge . As a result , both campaigns entered the crucial fall period still locked_in a close race and having little hope of straying from their attack strategies . The predictable result was that voters grew to dislike both candidates . Feinstein ' s favorable rating fell below that for Gov . Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown . And in a Times Poll just more_than a week ago , barely a quarter of respondents said they liked Huffington . The last week of the campaign became one of the most acrimonious , with disclosures that Huffington employed an illegal immigrant nanny for more_than four years and that the work visa for Feinstein ' s former Guatemalan housekeeper expired while the woman was still employed . The illegal immigrant debate dominated the final days of the race as both candidates broadcast commercials about the other ' s case . Circumstances in the two cases were different , though . Huffington acknowledged that he violated federal law by employing the nanny up until last year . His problem was made more embarrassing because he strongly supported Proposition 187 , the ballot measure that would cut most health and education benefits to illegal immigrants . Feinstein opposed the initiative . In Feinstein ' s case , immigration officials confirmed Friday that a housekeeper she employed a decade ago had a visa to be in the country legally only if she worked_at the Guatemalan Consulate -- not in a private home . Even that permission expired a year after the woman began working for Feinstein in 1980 , they said . Feinstein maintained , however , that she did not violate federal law because there was no rule against employing an illegal immigrant until 1986 . Throughout the race , name-calling and accusations dominated the contest on television . On the campaign trail , however , the stump_speeches revealed a striking philosophical choice between two very different candidates . Feinstein championed the performance of government , highlighting everything from farm subsidies to disaster relief , crime control and small business incentives . Huffington was almost the opposite , boasting to audiences that he votes against most appropriations_bills and many government regulations and opposed any new taxes .</TEXT>
