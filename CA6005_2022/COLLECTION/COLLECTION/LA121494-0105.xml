   <HEADLINE> COMMON_GROUND ; HUMAN_RIGHTS : FOREIGN ACTIVISTS TOUR SOUTHLAND , FINDING SIMILARITIES TO PROBLEMS IN THEIR COUNTRIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Police brutality . Scapegoating of unpopular groups . Deprivation of civil_liberties . All are concerns distressingly familiar to Peter Volmink , a longtime South_African activist , and fellow human_rights crusaders worldwide . In recent days , however , Volmink and civil_rights monitors from Brazil , Zaire , Haiti , Bulgaria and Pakistan have been receiving a singular civics lesson , learning about similar vexing dilemmas right here in Southern California . &quot; The situation in South_Africa and here is obviously not exactly the same , but there are parallels , &quot; said Volmink , who is known for his work in the &quot; Street Law &quot; program , which educates youth about their rights . He and eight other monitors were honored Tuesday evening at the third annual Los Angeles dinner benefiting Human_Rights Watch , the U.S.-based watchdog group . Barred from leaving their countries and honored in absentia were Moncef Marzouqi , who heads Tunisia ' s only independent human_rights organization , and Bao Tong , currently imprisoned in China . Deborah LaBelle , a Michigan lawyer who defends prisoners , was also among the honorees . Donors paid $ 250 a plate for the dinner at a Beverly Hills hotel . But the activists have spent time recently exploring humbler settings . U.S. laws usually offer greater protections than in the monitors ' nations -- and there is clearly no U.S. equivalent_to excesses such_as the Mobutu Sese Seko dictatorship in Zaire or the unpunished murders of peasants in Brazil ' s Amazon region . Nor do U.S. activists generally face the life-threatening situations that are often the norm in many other countries . But the monitors found similarities during a wide-ranging tour that included stops in Watts , East Los Angeles and Little Tokyo . &quot; The similarities are real , &quot; said Jean-Claude Jean , who works for democratic reform in Haiti and noted disparities of wealth and poverty in both countries . During a visit to Los Angeles ' Japanese American National Museum , the monitors heard of the World_War II-era internment of more_than 120 # 000 people of Japanese ancestry . Inevitably , conversation turned toward Proposition 187 , the successful ballot initiative that targets illegal immigrants . Proponents argued that the measure was needed to stem unlawful immigration , but Chris M . Komai of the museum staff had a different view . &quot; The people of California , in my personal opinion , were looking_for scapegoats for the bad economy , &quot; Komai said . That theme was familiar to Dimitrina Petrova , a Bulgarian native who monitors rights issues in Eastern Europe . She cited the Gypsies , long a targeted minority , who have experienced renewed discrimination in post-Communist Eastern Europe . &quot; What ' s happening to the Gypsies in my country is the same type of thing that is going_on with immigrants here , &quot; said Petrova , who was a dissident under her country ' s former Communist regime . &quot; Everyone wants to blame their problems on someone else. &quot; Joseph Mudumbi pointed_out that civil_war in Rwanda earlier this year sent about 1 million refugees fleeing into neighboring Zaire within a matter of weeks -- almost as_many refugees as the United States admitted legally during the past 10 years . The influx far outstripped Zaire ' s limited infrastructure . &quot; We need international aid for this problem , &quot; Mudumbi said . &quot; It is too_much for Zaire alone. &quot; Police abuse was a main topic when the monitors visited the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California . The ACLU , said the local branch ' s executive_director , Ramona Ripston , was disparaged as the &quot; criminals ' lobby &quot; by former U.S. Atty . Gen . Edwin Meese , reflecting a lack of popularity often shared by rights groups worldwide . In her homeland , Petrova noted , there is a saying : &quot; Bulgaria doesn ' t need foreign enemies as long as it has its human_rights monitors. &quot; I.A. Rehman , a former journalist who directs the Human_Rights Commission of Pakistan , raised a different dilemma : &quot; What about the rights of the family members of those convicted by the state ? &quot; These families , while blameless , often suffer economic ruin and social rejection , Rehman noted . On Tuesday , the monitors learned about gang violence and its effects from mothers at Dolores Mission Roman_Catholic_Church in Boyle Heights . Marta Sosa , whose 18-year-old son was killed in a gang-related incident last year , related how she now endeavors to promote peace among all area youths -- including members of the gang responsible_for her son ' s death . Outside a church day-care center , Father Ricardo Rezende , who works with peasants in the Brazilian Amazon region , was showing some black_and_white photographs of victims of violence in his parish to area residents . Delia Lopez , a 55-year-old mother , pointed to an image of a teen who had been shot in the neck . &quot; They shot me too , &quot; she said . Stray bullets intended for a gang member flew into her apartment one night in 1991 , one piercing her chest and lung . While the young perpetrators were very distinct from the pistoleiros of Brazil , Rezende said the shattering effects of their actions were much the same .</TEXT>
