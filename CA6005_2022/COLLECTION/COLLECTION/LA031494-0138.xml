Under the policy , students may face expulsion for making graphic sexual comments about other students , telling sexual jokes or stories , touching classmates or their clothes in a sexual manner , spreading sexual rumors , displaying sexually suggestive objects or retaliating against students who report policy violators . Unwelcome sexual flirtations or propositions also would be prohibited . In addition , if a sexual_relationship between a student and a teacher or other district employee is reported , the district would conduct an investigation . Should such a relationship be found to exist , the student may face expulsion , while the employee may face termination . District officials said they will consider the policy to provide &quot; a learning environment that is free_of sexually discriminatory intimidation. &quot; MIMI KO</TEXT>
