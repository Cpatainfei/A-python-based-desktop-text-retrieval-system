   <HEADLINE> ANGRY ITALIAN LAWMAKERS KILL DECREE FREEING CORRUPTION SUSPECTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a shouting and shoving match between government allies , lawmakers Thursday overwhelmingly nullified a Cabinet decree that released nearly 200 political corruption suspects from jail . The brawl illustrated the disarray within Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi ' s fraying 2-month-old government . The decree , approved by Berlusconi and Cabinet allies a week earlier , unleashed a storm of protest and handed Berlusconi his first crisis since he took_office in May . On Tuesday , Berlusconi bowed to pressure and announced the decree would be rescinded by the Cabinet and be presented to Parliament as proposed legislation . But Thursday , the Chamber of Deputies voted 418-33 with 41 abstentions to nullify the measure . Without the vote , the decree would have stayed in_effect until the Cabinet rescinded it later in the week , potentially allowing dozens of other corruption suspects out of jail . By Wednesday evening , 2 # 137 people out of about 4 # 000 eligible suspects had been released from prison under the decree . Most were small-time drug dealers or thieves , but close to 200 corruption suspects were released , including a former health minister . Many of those released were put_under house_arrest . The decree sharply limited the kinds of suspects who can be jailed while an investigation continues . Corruption , graft and other nonviolent crimes were eliminated from the preventive detention category . Critics call preventive detention an infringement on civil_liberties . But prosecutors say it has helped them crack_down on endemic political corruption .</TEXT>
