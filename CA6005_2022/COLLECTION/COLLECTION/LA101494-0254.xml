   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; U.S. BACK TO SQUARE ONE IN THE GULF ; MIDEAST : DESPITE HUGE SHOW OF AMERICAN FORCE , HUSSEIN IS STILL IN POWER , AND THE AREA IS STILL VULNERABLE , EXPERTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In its second confrontation with Saddam Hussein , the United States may have lost a critical opportunity to accelerate the political demise of the Iraqi dictator . The Clinton_Administration has used a massive show of force in the Persian_Gulf in hopes of warding_off any threatening Iraqi troop movements at the Kuwaiti border . But experts said that the Administration ' s tepid diplomatic move -- a proposed new United Nations resolution restricting the movement of Iraq ' s elite Republican Guard -- leaves the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq pretty much where it was : with Hussein ' s power unchecked and the strategic , oil-rich Gulf still vulnerable to his whims . &quot; We have a short-term posture that is viable , but no longer-term strategy to deal with the danger of Saddam next time , &quot; said William Quandt , who was a Middle_East strategist in the Jimmy_Carter Administration and now is at the University of Virginia . &quot; There ' s no policy to get us beyond the next year . So this doesn ' t look_like a great success. &quot; The political gains made during the decisive initial deployment of U.S. troops now could be diluted by lack of definitive follow-through as the United States appears to bow to its allies ' individual priorities , notably potential profits to be made in deals negotiated with Iraq . &quot; The Administration has created a situation where U.S. foreign_policy is reduced to the lowest common_denominator among the ( U.N. ) Security_Council , &quot; said Laurie Mylroie , a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia . And the President ' s image is suffering . A poll taken_for NBC-TV ' s &quot; Dateline &quot; and reported on that program Wednesday night showed that 51 % of Americans think Hussein will remain in office longer than Bill_Clinton . Experts have advocated a variety of political and military alternatives as responses to Iraq ' s massing of troops near Kuwait ' s border , but virtually all expressed concern Thursday that the Clinton_Administration ' s reaction falls far short of even minimal punishment . Many compared it to the George_Bush Administration ' s decision to back_away from any role in the simultaneous 1991 uprisings by northern Kurds and southern Shiite Muslims immediately after the war , a policy subsequently criticized by a Senate Foreign Relations Committee report as a missed opportunity to weaken and potentially topple Hussein . Most fundamentally , current U.S. strategy makes the long-sought end game ever more illusive . The U.S.-led coalition would effectively be conceding that it is prepared to deal only with the immediate issue of Kuwait ' s borders rather than the core problem of Hussein ' s rule . Even an Administration proposal Thursday to indefinitely deploy thousands more U.S. troops in the Persian_Gulf is a reaction to the current crisis and not a strategy for dealing with Hussein ' s rule . The repercussions of the U.S.-orchestrated response also play_out at other levels . * First , and most ominously , because the U.S. response has had negligible impact on his army , Hussein could move south and threaten Kuwait or Saudi borders again -- potentially even with the elite Republican Guard units , who supposedly are to be banned from border areas . &quot; What does limiting the Republican Guards do ? All Hussein has to do is put them in regular_army uniforms or rename the units , &quot; Mylroie said . &quot; Saddam will see this as a victory . We sent tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of warplanes halfway around the world at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars , and then did almost nothing . He ( Hussein ) hasn ' t paid a price , and he may think he ' s gained by drawing attention to the suffering in Iraq from sanctions , &quot; Mylroie added . * Second , the limited coalition response will not encourage the Iraqi opposition . Indeed , it may even discourage anti-Hussein activity in critical power centers such_as the Iraqi military , the only body deemed capable of overthrowing him . &quot; The impression in Baghdad is that the United States wants Saddam there , because we didn ' t support the 1991 rebellions . They believe that if we wanted him out , he ' d be out , &quot; said Phebe Marr of Washington ' s National Defense University . * Third , the U.S.-led coalition of European and Arab countries comes_away weakened , with the potential for further splintering . The United States is now widely seen as having succumbed to pressure by European allies , notably France and Russia , not to take stronger action , including a possible exclusion or demilitarized zone in southern Iraq . Both Paris and Moscow have been negotiating billion-dollar deals with Baghdad , to go_into effect when sanctions are lifted . Both have also endorsed expediting the process required to lift sanctions .</TEXT>
