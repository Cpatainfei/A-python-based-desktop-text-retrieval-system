   <HEADLINE> GLOBAL WILDLIFE SUMMIT UNDER WAY ; ENVIRONMENT : OFFICIALS FROM 124 NATIONS GATHER IN FLORIDA TO DRAFT POLICY ON ENDANGERED ANIMAL AND PLANT SPECIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It all started two decades ago with leopards , chimpanzees and crocodiles . Now , as 124 nations convene in Florida to decide the fate of the world ' s rarest and most coveted creatures , their mission has expanded in scope , encompassing more_than 25 # 000 protected animals and plants -- from orchids to tigers -- that have been exploited for enormous worldwide profits . Starting today , cabinet-level ministers and their entourage of several thousand delegates gather for a two-week summit to update and perhaps overhaul the world ' s largest conservation treaty , the Convention on International Trade_in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora . Often pitting nation against nation , the pact is designed to halt the exploitation of wild creatures for profit -- from elephants culled for their ivory to whales harpooned for their meat -- by banning or restricting the lucrative trade of products from rare and exotic species . On the eve of the first gathering in the United States since the treaty ' s conception in 1973 , each government is gearing_up for politically charged decisions that are critical to many nations ' environments and economies . &quot; CITES is one of the longest-standing conservation treaties and by many accounts the most successful , &quot; said Ginette Hemley , director of international policy for the World Wildlife Fund , a global conservation group . &quot; It has helped a number of species recover and helped countries maintain trade_in a sustainable way , &quot; she said . &quot; But we need some real results , some real decisions from the countries attending this meeting . It takes political will to make CITES work and stop illegal trade. &quot; Several dozen controversial species are up for debate at the Ft . Lauderdale summit . Included are proposals to partially lift a ban on the export of African_elephant products , proposed new restrictions on sale of mahogany from South_America and Mexico , and Norway ' s request to ease the ban on whaling by allowing trade_in minke_whales . Many of these global feuds pit the wealthy United States , Western Europe and Japan -- the major buyers of wildlife products -- against poorer African and Latin_American nations -- the major exporters -- that want to retain control over their own natural_resources and sustain their economies . &quot; It is a difficult task because , in addition to the scientific information , one should take into consideration economic and enforcement problems , and even political concerns , &quot; Obdulio Menghi , scientific coordinator of the CITES Secretariat , based in Geneva , said in a statement . The U.S. delegation , headed by Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt , has not yet decided its stance on the most heated issues , especially how to vote on South_Africa ' s elephant proposal . South_Africa has petitioned to partially lift the 1989 ban on elephant trade by allowing sales of hide while retaining the ban on ivory . The Clinton_Administration wants to ensure its position does not jeopardize U.S. relations with South_African President Nelson Mandela , so Vice_President Al Gore will make the final_decision based on input from Babbitt and other wildlife officials , members of the National Security_Council and U.S. trade representatives . South_Africa is overpopulated with elephants due_to that nation ' s strong conservation efforts , and officials there say if they can sell some hides from culled herds , they will allocate the money to enhance their crackdown on poachers . Most member nations agree with South_Africa in theory , yet some worry that cracking open the window to limited trade could revive an uncontrolled rush of poachers and spur illegal sales of ivory . Conservation and animal-rights groups are divided on the proposal , too . In many cases , the treaty has succeeded in protecting species , mostly through public-awareness campaigns in the richer Western nations . For instance , ivory products are decidedly unfashionable in the United States and Europe , causing a steep decline in elephant poaching since the creatures were unanimously protected in 1989 . While Kenya lost up_to 5 # 000 elephants per year during the 1980s , now fewer than 50 are killed annually , according to the Environmental Investigation Agency , a Washington , D.C.-based environmental group . Babbitt ' s team also has been divided on whether to vote to restrict sales of mahogany from Brazil and Mexico , a move that timber traders and U.S. furniture manufacturers have campaigned against . The United States is the largest importer of tropical mahogany , a popular wood for furniture , but U.S._government officials are split on the issue . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the forests need protection , while U.S. forestry officials argue they do not . Babbitt reportedly has reached a decision , but the result has not been revealed . Under the proposal , sale of mahogany would remain legal , but Mexico and Brazil would regulate its trade , which would cause a price hike and perhaps some shortages . &quot; The timber proposal is very hot . It has torn_up the U.S._government internally , &quot; Hemley said . &quot; The Forest Service has come_out with guns blazing. &quot; Before the delegates adjourn on Nov . 18 , they also will wrestle with setting standards for deciding which species to protect and which ones to reject . Most of the nations , including the United States , want the decisions based on science rather than politics and emotions , while others are pushing for more flexibility . The countries will also debate how to halt widespread poaching and black_markets in violation of the treaty , oftentimes in countries that lack the will or funds to initiate conservation programs . If a nation fails to enforce the treaty it signed , the others have the authority to impose trade sanctions . That , however , rarely occurs because of global political sensitivities and financial dilemmas . For example , tigers in India and Russia ' s far_east , despite the treaty ' s highest level of protection , are still being decimated by poachers who hawk the rare animals ' bones for use in Asian medicines . The rhinoceros is also near extinction because of an illegal , lucrative black_market for its horns . U.S. environmentalists fear that if the session adjourns without resolving enforcement dilemmas , Siberian and Bengal_tigers and African rhinos could nearly be wiped_out by the time the delegates convene again in two to three years . The World Wildlife Fund is urging wealthier nations to help Russia and India by offering financial_aid and training . When the accord was signed_in Washington , D.C. , in 1973 , there were only 21 signatories , as varied as Brazil , the United Kingdom , Iran , South_Africa and Thailand . The treaty now bans trade of more_than 600 species and restricts it for more_than 25 # 000 others .</TEXT>
