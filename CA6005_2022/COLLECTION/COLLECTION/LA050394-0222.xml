   <HEADLINE> GNATCATCHER TAKEN OFF THREATENED SPECIES LIST ; COURTS : JUDGE SAYS FAILURE TO DISCLOSE DATA WAS IMPROPER . RULING MAY OPEN_DOOR TO O.C. DEVELOPMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what environmentalists termed a significant setback to efforts to protect endangered species , a federal_district court in Washington on Monday overturned the Interior_Department ' s listing of the California gnatcatcher as a threatened species . The ruling in a 1992 lawsuit filed by the Southern California Building Industry Assn . and Orange County ' s tollway agencies leaves the tiny songbird -- prevalent in southern Orange and northern San Diego counties -- exposed to the plans of builders eager to develop much of its coastal sage scrub habitat . The decision , by U . S . District Judge Stanley Sporkin , represented a major victory for the Southern California building industry . Both sides in the dispute -- the developers who have fought against listing the gnatcatcher as threatened and the environmentalists who have tried to ensure its protection -- agreed that the ruling could have enormous implications . &quot; This is absolutely a step_in the wrong direction , one that could have a devastating impact on the habitat planning program &quot; to protect endangered species in Southern California , said Joel Reynolds , a senior attorney with the Natural_Resources Defense Council , which had successfully petitioned the Interior_Department to list the gnatcatcher as threatened . &quot; The listing of the gnatcatcher is the foundation upon which the conservation efforts in Southern California have been based , &quot; Reynolds said . &quot; To remove that underpinning may throw the entire planning process into disarray. &quot; In a brief statement , Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt declined to comment in detail before studying the decision , but he suggested that an appeal was likely . &quot; All of the information we have indicates that the California gnatcatcher meets the criteria for listing under the Endangered Species Act , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; We will therefore take the steps necessary to guarantee its protection. &quot; California developers , meanwhile , expressed elation at the judge ' s decision , which at least temporarily removes the 4 1 / 2-inch , gray-and-black songbird from protection under the Endangered Species Act , the nation ' s most stringent environmental law . &quot; This is a huge victory , &quot; said Rob Thornton , an attorney for the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies , which is planning a number of toll roads in Orange County . &quot; The court obviously vindicated our position . . . which was that there was a significant question about the scientific merits of the study upon which the listing was based. &quot; Thornton said the ruling &quot; effectively repudiates &quot; what he called the efforts of environmentalists &quot; to illegitimately twist the Endangered Species Act into a tool for stopping development in_general , and specifically halting construction of the San Joaquin Hills &quot; tollway . The judge ' s decision centered narrowly on the openness of the process involved in the March , 1993 , decision to list the gnatcatcher as a threatened species , which effectively halted all development plans in the areas where the birds nest -- some of the most_desirable ocean- and canyon-view land in Southern California . In their lawsuit challenging the listing , the developers and tollway agencies raised three issues : * That they were denied access to the raw scientific data supporting a report the government relied_upon in deciding that an estimated 3 # 000 pairs of California gnatcatchers were part of a unique species whose declining population warranted a listing under the Endangered Species Act . * That Interior_Secretary Babbitt acted with bias in reaching the listing decision . * That certain procedural requirements of the Endangered Species Act were not followed . The judge ruled that the last two issues lacked merit , but he agreed that the Interior_Department was wrong when it declined to make the raw scientific data available to ornithologists hired by the builders to challenge the government ' s decision . What the builders had sought were the notes and calculations of Jonathan L . Atwood , a Massachusetts ornithologist who had spent several years studying gnatcatchers , comparing various characteristics of the tiny songbirds , such_as the size of their bills and the length of their tails and toes . In 1988 , Atwood wrote a scientific paper in which he concluded that the California gnatcatchers , which live_in Orange , San Diego , Riverside and San Bernardino counties and on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in Los Angeles County , are essentially no different from the 2.5 million pairs of gnatcatchers that are found in large portions of Mexico and the western United States . After the paper was severely criticized by other scientists , Atwood went_back to his data and wrote in a 1990 report that his first conclusions were wrong and that the California gnatcatchers are indeed distinct from their Mexican cousins . Atwood ' s 1990 report was the primary scientific evidence that the government relied_upon in deciding to list the gnatcatcher as a threatened species . &quot; In light of the fact that ( Atwood ) had analyzed the identical raw data in 1988 and 1990 and had come_to different conclusions , &quot; the court ruling said , the &quot; scientific validity &quot; of the second study was challenged , and the Building Industry Assn . demanded access to the raw data that Atwood used to reach his conclusions . The Interior_Department declined to provide the data , saying that it did not have the data and had relied solely on the finished 1990 report . In making that decision , the judge said , the Interior_Department was wrong . &quot; Where an agency relies_upon data to come_to a rule-making decision , it generally has an obligation under the Administrative Procedures Act to provide such data for public inspection , &quot; the ruling said . The plaintiffs , the judge wrote , &quot; were deprived of important and material information from which they could make meaningful analysis in_order to provide their views &quot; on the issue . He returned the_matter to the Interior_Department for &quot; further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. &quot; Reached by telephone at his Massachusetts home Monday , Atwood declined to discuss the question of his willingness to release his raw scientific data regarding the gnatcatcher . &quot; If it was the end of the process , I would be disappointed , &quot; Atwood said , adding that he would be surprised if efforts to preserve the bird and its habitat in the sagebrush mesas and coastal hills of Southern California would &quot; just go_away &quot; as a result of the ruling . Meanwhile , environmentalists and state and federal fish and wildlife officials expressed concern about the impact of the decision on the Natural Communities Conservation Program . The program , developed by Gov . Pete Wilson in 1991 and adopted last December by the federal_government , encourages landowners to voluntarily set_aside habitat for the gnatcatcher and other rare animals and plants . In exchange , property_owners can speed approval to develop the rest of their land without having to go_through the time-consuming -- and often litigious -- endangered species process . &quot; This is a cooperative planning process that was years in the making and that was premised upon the protected status of the California gnatcatcher , &quot; said Reynolds of the Natural_Resources Defense Council . Reynolds said the decision to list the gnatcatcher as threatened involved &quot; the most open and searching rule-making on a listing that anyone can recall . To conclude that nevertheless it was inadequate is very disappointing. &quot; Dave Klinger , spokesman for the western regional office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , said Monday that federal wildlife officials continue to believe that the inclusion of the tiny bird on the list of threatened species is appropriate . &quot; we ' ll have to look_at the court ' s decision to see where we go from this point on , &quot; Klinger said . &quot; We want to take some time with it and make certain we fully understand the court ' s direction. &quot; Michael Mantell , the undersecretary of resources for the California Resources Agency , expressed concern about the immediate impact of the decision on the voluntary conservation program , questioning whether developers might choose not to participate in the wake of the ruling . &quot; This decision throws into question how you go_about dealing with the interim controls and protection for threatened species , &quot; Mantell said . &quot; We hope they will stay_at the table to complete plans &quot; for Orange , Riverside and San Diego counties . Mantell said his office plans to hold meetings within the next few weeks with all participants -- environmentalists , developers and government officials -- to decide how best to proceed with interim planning . &quot; The real question is what happens to the habitat until these plans are completed , &quot; he said . Richard Jacobs , lead attorney for the Building Industry Assn. , which includes some 1 # 800 developers , said he expects varied responses to the ruling among association members . &quot; Many people had been going_through the process , trying to develop habitat areas on their properties , &quot; he said . &quot; A number of those people undoubtedly will say they don ' t want to have any part of that in the wake of this ruling , while others will voluntarily decide to stay in. &quot; The ruling is expected to benefit large landowners , such_as the Irvine Co. , Orange County ' s largest private landowner . Larry Thomas , a company vice_president , said top officials had not seen the ruling and had little comment , but he said the company continues to abide_by the terms of the Natural Communities Conservation Program . &quot; We want to see the ruling and determine what , if any , impact it has , &quot; he said . &quot; Nobody feels comfortable commenting until we see what the ruling was based on and how broad or narrow it is. &quot; Diane Gaynor , a spokeswoman for the Santa Margarita Co. , another of Orange County ' s largest private landholders , also declined to comment on specifics of the ruling or its potential implications . Regardless of Monday ' s decision or any future legal_action , she said , the company remains committed to the Natural Communities Conservation Program . Laer Pierce , a spokesman for a coalition of Orange and San Diego county developers involved in the conservation planning project , said he expects the program to go_forward . &quot; We ' re really glad we won this one . But in the long_run , most developers will continue moving_in the same direction -- toward a new concept of voluntary habitat preservation , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re working to identify the most critical habitats and preserve them , while at_the_same_time identifying the less critical habitats and develop those , instead of just trying to preserve every beak and feather. &quot;</TEXT>
