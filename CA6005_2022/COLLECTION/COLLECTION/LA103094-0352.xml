   <TEXT> The famous guests made their way through the rain into the warmth of Joanne Carson ' s candle-lit Bel-Air home . Just beyond the door , they found a small registration table . Esther Williams , Patti Davis , Jon Voight , Bruce Davison and other luminaries dutifully signed_in . The guest of honor -- a tall intense-looking man in his 70s -- waited in the kitchen . Everyone had heard about him , but few had met him . As they filed by to shake his hand , Dr. Henry Heimlich nodded and smiled . &quot; Thanks for coming . Thank_you for your support. &quot; It was spring , 1993 , and Heimlich , bold inventor of the anti-choking maneuver , had come_to Los Angeles with a bold pitch : To end the scourge AIDS by 1994 . The room fell silent . &quot; We were awe-struck , &quot; recalled Carson . &quot; We all said , ' This is hot . This could be it ! ' &quot; Heimlich ' s prescription for AIDS ? Give the patient malaria . With no shortage of malaria in the world -- or of desperate AIDS patients -- all he needed was the money . And from Hollywood ' s best and brightest , he would get_it . &quot; People were so moved by his presentations , that at the end of the evening , everybody went_home and sent their checks_in , &quot; recalled Carson , who hosted three fund-raising dinners last year . Actress Amy Irving gave $ 50 # 000 . Other major supporters included actress Estelle Getty , high-powered agent Sandy Bresler and ventriloquist Paul Winchell , according to Heimlich ' s foundation and other sources . Fueled by hundreds of thousands of dollars from such celebrity donations , Heimlich researchers have begun injecting a small group of HIV-positive men in China with malaria-infected blood . At best , warn infectious_disease experts , the treatment will cause no harm . At worst , they say , it can kill . &quot; Heimlich ' s life-saving maneuver for people who aspirate food doesn ' t qualify one as an HIV expert , &quot; said leading AIDS researcher Dr. Anthony Fauci , who called malaria therapy &quot; quite dangerous and scientifically unsound. &quot; In an interview this month Heimlich dismissed criticism of his plan . He said no one has been harmed by the treatment and that the first two patients were already &quot; feeling better. &quot; Still , he cautioned against &quot; false hopes. &quot; &quot; We have a long way to go , &quot; said Heimlich , who expects no final results for another year or two . Nevertheless , he added , &quot; we could always benefit by having more funds. &quot; This is not the first time the 74-year-old Heimlich ' s headstrong approach to medicine has shocked , even outraged the Establishment . &quot; I don ' t do ordinary things . I don ' t follow all_the rules if there ' s a better , faster way to do_it , &quot; he boasts . Induced malaria therapy -- IMT , as he calls it -- consists_of &quot; inoculating &quot; patients with blood teeming with malaria_parasites . Citing the use of a similar therapy for neurosyphilis in the 1920s , Heimlich believes malaria induces production of immune substances that could help patients overcome HIV . The tiny pathogen that causes malaria -- the protozoan Plasmodium -- flourishes in the human_body , growing inside red_blood_cells until the cells burst . Without enough red cells to carry oxygen , even patients with the most benign strains can suffer severe anemia and die from renal_failure or convulsions from 106-degree fevers . Citing concerns for the safety of human subjects , a group of 20 scientists and physicians from the United States and Mexico have petitioned top U.S. regulatory_agencies to investigate Heimlich ' s Hollywood fund-raising_campaign and the touted treatment of HIV . &quot; This exploits the AIDS crisis , exploits the generous and caring entertainment community , and it exploits the good that Heimlich himself has done_in the past , &quot; said Dr. Paul Bronston , national ethics chair of the American College of Medical Quality and a petition supporter . &quot; ( That petition ) is an annoying and painful thing , &quot; Heimlich said . &quot; But this happens . It ' s very common in my life . Some people think if they attack a famous_person , they can become as famous as the assassin . . . Just as the Kennedy assassins became famous . &quot; And our work takes time . Look , it took the Red_Cross 12 1 / 2 years to ( endorse ) the Heimlich maneuver. &quot; Unproven Therapies In the absence of a cure for AIDS , underground trafficking in unproven , experimental therapies is thriving here and abroad . Desperate for even a crumb of hope , patients have ingested photographic chemicals , been sealed_in hyperbaric_chambers and taken injections of everything from snake venom to hydrogen_peroxide . What stands_out about the malaria treatment is that , like the anti-choking maneuver , it carries the imprimatur of Heimlich . &quot; His name carries a lot of weight , &quot; said one loyal Hollywood supporter . &quot; For many of us in the entertainment_industry , meeting him was like meeting Albert Schweitzer . And sure , that affected our generosity. &quot; &quot; There ' s something about making movies that makes you believe_in miracles , &quot; said actress Esther Williams . &quot; No question he ' s one of the great geniuses of our time . I expect he will receive a Nobel prize , &quot; said Carson , ex-wife of former &quot; Tonight &quot; show host Johnny Carson . She invited Heimlich to Los Angeles , she said , &quot; because I wanted to help him . I think he is very close to the answer and I wanted to get people together who really cared so Hank could talk to them and raise the money he needed to start the project. &quot; The entertainment community has lost too many of its own to wait any longer , say Carson and other Heimlich supporters . And if the search for a cure risks lives ? &quot; Well , &quot; Bresler said , &quot; that ' s the way it is . This is not a party . People who have HIV are going_to die anyway . &quot; If you have volunteers willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of mankind , I ' m all for it. &quot; ' Creative ' Approach From the day he picked_up his M.D. from Cornell Medical College in 1943 , Henry Jay Heimlich has reveled in his knack for doing what others say cannot be done . &quot; I have never had a failure , &quot; he says with bracing -- if not always accurate -- self-regard . &quot; It may take a while for the others to see what I see . But eventually , they do . Like I always say , ' If your peers understand what you ' ve done , you are not being creative. ' &quot; No question , this man is creative . As a 35-year-old chest surgeon , he devised a way to reconstruct an esophagus from a patient ' s stomach . He called it the Heimlich Operation -- &quot; the world ' s first transplant. &quot; Then came the Heimlich Chest Drainage Valve , first fashioned from a rubber dime-store toy that makes a Bronx_cheer when you blow on it : &quot; That valve saved lives on both sides of the Vietnam_War and is still saving lives today. &quot; He invented the Heimlich Micro Trach to provide portable oxygen for patients with debilitating lung disease . In news_reports , patients called it &quot; the Heimlich Miracle. &quot; But it is as the creator of the Heimlich Maneuver that the irrepressible inventor is most famous . &quot; According to Norman Vincent Peale , I ' ve probably saved more lives than any man living today , &quot; Heimlich says . ( Officials estimate that 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 people are rescued each year by his method , which involves wrapping one ' s arms around the victim from behind and thrusting a fist between the rib_cage and navel. ) But with his unconventional approaches have come controversy . For more_than a decade neither the American Red_Cross nor the American Heart Assn . would endorse the maneuver because they said Heimlich could not provide scientific proof that it worked . Heimlich ' s response ? &quot; We used the media . We couldn ' t wait for more people to die . We went right to the people and we taught them how to do_it on TV . We were saving lives while the Red_Cross was still telling people to slap choking kids on the back . &quot; I was right , &quot; Heimlich said , &quot; and they knew it and they risked lives by not going_along . Creative thinking begins with not accepting anything that is supposed to be fact. &quot; But over the last 20 years , skeptics say the doctor ' s work has moved closer and closer to the fringe . In the last decade , he has proposed treatments for AIDS , cancer , asthma , even war . Heimlich and his nonprofit institute are based in Cincinnati , where he brought his chest surgery practice , his wife and four children nearly 25 years ago . Jane Murray Heimlich , a daughter of the famed dance team of Arthur and Kathryn Murray , is an advocate of alternative_medicine and best-selling author of &quot; What Your Doctor Won ' t Tell You. &quot; According to Heimlich , the work of controversial physician Julian Wagner-Jauregg -- who won a Nobel Prize in 1927 for using malaria to treat syphilis of the brain -- inspired his early interest . But the widow of Leonard B . Greentree , a Harvard-trained Ohio physician who published a 1981 paper on malaria therapy , believes her husband ' s work was equally inspirational to Heimlich . &quot; Nobody courted my husband for his ideas as much as Dr. Heimlich , &quot; recalled Edith F . Greentree . &quot; In 1982 , we met with Dr. Heimlich at his home_in Cincinnati for the expressed purpose of discussing my husband ' s hypothesis that malaria might be a cure for cancer . Dr. Heimlich wanted us to give him money ( to ) set_up a foundation and Dr. Greentree said , ' Wait a minute , this idea is mine . I want a controlled study someplace , not publicity. ' &quot; But , his critics say , controlled studies are not Heimlich ' s style . When he first advocated the anti-choking method his research consisted almost entirely of collecting anecdotes on how the maneuver was saving lives . Like Greentree , Heimlich first envisioned malaria therapy as a cancer treatment . For that disease as well as for Lyme disease and HIV , Heimlich believes malaria can stimulate immune_responses . In the mid-1980s , Heimlich asked the Centers_for_Disease_Control to help him get malaria-infected blood for his studies . When plans to do the research here collapsed , Heimlich ' s foundation offered its support to doctors in Mexico , Panama and China . Although the &quot; successes &quot; of those cancer experiments are cited in Heimlich ' s Hollywood appeal for AIDS research funding , no reports on the methods or results have been published for traditional scientific review . &quot; To conduct legitimate research in this country , you need a host of safeguards , &quot; said Bronston . The Los Angeles physician joined the petition to investigate Heimlich ' s research after attending a fund-raiser hosted by Carson , a friend of Heimlich ' s wife . &quot; You need review by other researchers in the field , you need careful protocols , you need uniform protection for the patients who are entrusting you with their lives. &quot; But much of the Heimlich Foundation ' s funding appeal consists_of references_to other scientists ' research -- research experts say cannot always be verified by outside reviewers . The funding appeal describes a 1990 study in Zaire that found that a group of children who had malaria and AIDS were &quot; living and well &quot; after a two-year trial . &quot; To Dr. Heimlich , &quot; potential donors were advised , &quot; the significant result is that none of the malaria- infected AIDS patients died. &quot; But when asked later whether those children were still alive , Heimlich said , &quot; You ' re wondering ! What about me ? Nobody tried harder than we did ( to find_out ) . &quot; Dr. Frank Sonnenberg , a Rutgers physician who evaluates research proposals for the National Institutes of Health , calls Heimlich ' s proposal &quot; monumentally flawed , &quot; and says it would be &quot; resoundingly rejected by any credible grant review committee. &quot; Scope Expanded At the end of the 1980s , Heimlich returned to Mexico to expand his experiments to include sufferers of Lyme disease , an arthritis-like immune disorder caused by a tick bite . Although most cases are easily cured by antibiotics , a small percentage of patients do not recover . The first American Lyme disease patient to receive the malaria treatment in Mexico was Cyndi Monahan , a 28-year-old New Jersey aerobics instructor so crippled by the disease she was confined to a wheelchair . Monahan recently recalled the experiments as &quot; exciting ( and ) very clandestine , like a drug deal . We flew down there and went_to this hotel . This doctor came_to our room and opened a black valise with these little vials of blood . He had ( me ) lie_down on the bed and he injected ( me ) with the blood . And ( I ) went_back to the States like on the next flight and pretty soon ( I ) broke_out with malaria. &quot; Monahan said she was cured -- for almost three weeks . &quot; I was pretty much without symptoms . I could walk , I could run , I could even exercise some , &quot; she recalled . &quot; But then I started to get sick again , and I can ' t tell you how disappointed I was . By then , I was out of money , totally bankrupt. &quot; To raise the money for more malaria therapy , Monahan sought help from her local newspaper , which invited readers to make tax-deductible donations . The campaign raised about $ 15 # 000 and she returned to Mexico_City where , Monahan said , the same doctor gave her another injection of malaria-infected blood . She identified the doctor as Heimlich ' s friend Oscar Velasco . Although Velasco said he does not recall Monahan specifically , he confirmed that he has worked with Heimlich and has treated American patients with malaria therapy . Although the second treatment took her to &quot; a nicer hotel , &quot; Monahan said , it was not as effective . &quot; Turns_out I developed an immunity to malaria , I guess. &quot; Now 32 , Monahan told The Times this spring that she is &quot; about 65 % as bad as I was before I took Dr. Heimlich ' s malaria therapy . . . But I still can ' t live_on my own . I need someone to take_care of me pretty much all_the time. &quot; Heimlich said he has spoken with Monahan often , but she was never under his care . In fact , while the Heimlich Institute supports such research , Heimlich said he has never personally treated anyone with malaria therapy . Sallie Timpone , a 34-year-old mother of three who was with Monahan in Mexico_City , has been speaking out against both Heimlich and malaria therapy for years . Although she , too , experienced an early remission , Timpone says she is now as sick as ever : &quot; I ' ve been hooked_up to IVs of antibiotics but nothing really helps . I ' m so sick and weak most days I can hardly get_out of bed . But if anybody ever asked me about Dr. Heimlich and his supposed cure , I would n ' t hesitate to tell them to run_away fast . &quot; When I called him again and again and told him to stop using me as an example of how malaria therapy was the cure for Lyme disease , &quot; Timpone said , &quot; he never called me back and kept telling people I was fine , when I am definitely not fine. &quot; Heimlich said that he first met Timpone at a medical meeting . &quot; She had had a complete remission , I recall , but I know she didn ' t take the full course of malaria treatment. &quot; Other Lyme patients , said Heimlich , have been symptom-free for five years . &quot; In certain cases , we ' ve had remarkable results , OK ? My God , ( what ) if I told you about a woman who was crawling for several years on the floor because of Lyme disease and she owns 15 horses now and is riding them ! &quot; Heimlich refused to identify the woman or other patients , citing confidentiality . High Risk Cited By the spring of 1993 , when Heimlich was nibbling hors d ' oeuvres with Hollywood celebrities , Dr. Sergio Perez Barrio was preparing to receive the first HIV patients for malaria injections in Mexico . Among them were to be volunteers from the Los Angeles area -- men with the AIDS virus who , Heimlich said , would be cared_for before and after their treatments by &quot; courageous &quot; local physicians . Perez , a former public health officer for the border towns around Juarez , says he was handpicked by Heimlich to conduct the first malaria trials . But by early this year , Perez said , he told Heimlich that the risk to HIV patients was too high . &quot; We talked_about the money it would cost to care_for AIDS patients and the risk of exposing them to malaria , &quot; Perez said . &quot; And I believe that is when he decided not to proceed with the trials here in Mexico. &quot; Heimlich , who says he draws no salary for his role in the research , said Perez ' s estimate of $ 18 # 000 a patient was too high . He added that that &quot; the costs increased markedly when it became apparent that Americans would be involved. &quot; When the site of the trials was switched to China , U.S. patients were disqualified , he said . Probes Sought Hundreds of millions have been spent on government-approved AIDS studies , with no cure or effective treatment to show for it . Many top U.S. scientists have all but lost hope of finding a cure through traditional means . That made Heimlich ' s proposal and its relatively modest $ 591 # 800 price_tag seem well-timed . &quot; Hank ' s work doesn ' t involve hundreds of patients and all_of that investment , &quot; said Heimlich ' s long-time friend and research consultant , Dr. Harry Gibbons , retired public health director for Salt_Lake_City . &quot; In many ways , he ' s offering a real bargain. &quot; But Heimlich ' s cost-cutting does little to advance the search for a cure , according to Dr. Carlos del Rio , director general of Mexico ' s AIDS prevention and control agency . Del Rio said he was &quot; outraged by the Heimlich proposal &quot; and told petition organizers they could count_on his cooperation . Del Rio is among the scientists and physicians who seek state and federal probes of Heimlich ' s AIDS project . &quot; We are extremely concerned that the IMT proposal may be deceptive and may contain false conclusions , &quot; says the petition . &quot; We are particularly concerned about the health and safety of those who may subject themselves to this treatment as well as the possible exploitative techniques for fund-raising. &quot; Officials of the National Institutes of Health , the Food and Drug Administration , FBI and IRS -- the agencies addressed by the petition -- declined comment . But the CDC responded by issuing a public health alert . In a four-page statement , three top CDC officials repeat the agency ' s opposition to malaria therapy for Lyme disease and warn against the Heimlich Foundation ' s proposal to use the treatment on HIV . &quot; No evidence currently exists to indicate that malaria infection would beneficially affect the course of HIV infection , &quot; said the CDC , which noted that malaria-infected blood could contain other contaminants . CDC warned that any human research &quot; should undergo thorough ethical review , &quot; and said the deliberate infection of humans with malaria &quot; cannot be justified. &quot; Unlike traditional research protocols , few Heimlich projects begin in the laboratory , or even with laboratory animals . Because he is philosophically opposed to animal research , Heimlich ' s guinea_pigs are usually humans . That and his failure to publish his research , to expose it to the rigors of peer_review , have been the source of persistent criticism . Heimlich told The Times this month that he had agreed to cooperate with the China-based doctors in publishing the AIDS research results as soon as there is solid data to report . &quot; If the results look favorable , &quot; Heimlich said , &quot; we ' ll certainly reach_out for more volunteers -- and more support. &quot; Heimlich said that the nine HIV-positive patients who have been infected with malarial blood are men in their 20s and 30s who have given informed consent . &quot; Our protocols meet all_the standards -- exceed the standards -- required in the U.S. I am very strict , &quot; he said . The AIDS project ' s protocol calls_for patients to receive &quot; inoculations of malaria_parasites &quot; and be admitted to a medical facility . After 10 to 14 fevers -- spiking near 106 degrees over three to four weeks -- the researchers administer anti-malaria medications . But , Heimlich assures supporters , only &quot; the benign form &quot; of the disease -- the Plasmodium_vivax strain -- is used . CDC malaria specialist Peter Bloland agrees that the vivax strain is among the most curable , but cautions that even in the laboratory , great_care must be taken_to guarantee that that is the only malaria_parasite in a sample and that no other blood-borne diseases are present . &quot; Rarely is malaria-infected blood used for such research , &quot; said Bloland . &quot; We most always rely_on mosquitoes specially bred to ( harbor ) the specific malaria_parasite we want to use. &quot; Heimlich insists that the blood injected into the volunteers is thoroughly screened for other diseases . And the danger to patients ? &quot; With the malaria , we can stop ( the treatment ) if the patient is not doing_well , &quot; Heimlich said . So far , he said , all_the patients have &quot; tolerated the treatment well and their malaria has been curable. &quot; As Heimlich continues to travel the world to see patients before and after their malaria treatments , he says he is hurt and confused by those who question his work . &quot; It ' s happened before , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s politics . Or it ' s financial . Or one scientist knows another . Or somebody is working_on a vaccine for Lyme disease or for AIDS or what-have-you and they ' re afraid we ' ll get their funding . &quot; But , you know , if I have something I think is good , how can I let ( the people ) die ? &quot; Heimlich asked . &quot; He is risking people ' s lives and he is trading on the life-saving aura of his name to get people to help him , &quot; said Dr. John Renner of the National Council Against Health Fraud , which has been tracking the Heimlich project . &quot; After this , he won ' t go_down in history for the Heimlich maneuver . He ' ll go_down in history as a bizarre , mad scientist. &quot; Helping Heimlich Dr. Henry Heimlich ' s proposal to give AIDS patients blood tainted with malaria has attracted support from celebrities , including these three .
