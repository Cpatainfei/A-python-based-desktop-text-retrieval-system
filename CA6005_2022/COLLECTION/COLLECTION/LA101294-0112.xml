   <HEADLINE> CITY OFFICIALS LIABLE TO PAY DAMAGES , HIGH_COURT RULES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a setback for the Los Angeles City_Council in a dispute over a Sunland police shooting , the Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling that elected lawmakers can be forced to pay damages personally for official actions , such_as rescuing officers from financial judgments in police brutality suits . Without comment or dissent , the justices refused to hear the Los Angeles city attorney ' s argument that local lawmakers are entitled to &quot; absolute immunity &quot; from such damage suits . In March , a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that , while legislators cannot be sued for passing laws , they can be held personally liable for decisions that are &quot; administrative or executive in nature. &quot; The decision cleared the way for Los Angeles City_Council members to be sued for using city funds to pay court damages assessed for brutality against former Police_Chief Daryl Gates and nine police_officers . The decision stemmed from a 1990 incident in which a team of officers from the elite Special Investigations Section gunned_down four robbers who had just held_up a McDonald ' s restaurant in Sunland . Four relatives of the robbers sued Gates and the officers , contending that the police shot them without provocation . The high_court did not issue a written ruling endorsing the appeals court decision , nor has the suit against the Los Angeles council_members gone_to trial . Still , Monday ' s court action puts lawmakers on notice that they have to pay from their own pockets if their actions violate constitutional rights . &quot; I think this is going_to have a long-term impact on governing bodies , &quot; said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , who voted for the payment and is a defendant in the suit . Elected officials will have to think_twice before getting involved in volatile disputes , such_as police brutality cases , he said . Attorney Stephen Yagman -- who represents the plaintiffs in the Sunland suit and has been involved in numerous cases against the LAPD -- cheered the court ' s action . &quot; This is the most significant police brutality decision ever rendered because it ' s the first one in which elected officials have been put personally at risk for police brutality , &quot; he said in a phone interview from New York . &quot; It ' s the first decision that will provide a real incentive for the political_hacks who run the city of Los Angeles to get_off their butts and do something about the awful LAPD. &quot; &quot; They are trapped , &quot; Yagman said of the 10 Los Angeles City_Council members facing the damage suit . &quot; They have ratified a policy of using excessive force . Now the noose is around their collective neck , and it ' s getting tighter. &quot; In the Sunland case , a jury handed_down a $ 44 # 000 verdict against Gates and the nine officers . In reaction , the City_Council voted to pay the damages for Gates and the officers . Yagman then filed a new suit arguing that the council ' s action amounted to condoning police brutality and asking_for unspecified damages from the council_members personally . Although he was an outspoken critic of Gates , Yaroslavsky called the incident &quot; a classic case where an officer should not have been asked to &quot; pay punitive damages . The police became involved in a shootout with armed robbers fleeing the scene of a crime , Yaroslavsky said . &quot; What could have been the malice ? &quot; At the time , members of the controversial SIS squad said they refrained_from interrupting the robbery for fear of jeopardizing a manager being held hostage in the restaurant . Critics contend that the SIS had tracked the four robbers for some time , holding_back to build a stronger case against them . &quot; It ' s a tough call , &quot; Yaroslavsky said . &quot; Do you go_in and try to break it up and in the process , risk women and children ? Or do you let them carry_out the robbery in the hopes they won ' t hurt anybody ? . . . It ' s one of the reasons I ' m not a police officer. &quot; The suit is awaiting trial . City attorneys hoped to have it dismissed in preliminary motions but instead have suffered a series of stunning reversals . In general , the Supreme Court has said that lawmakers are entitled to &quot; absolute immunity . . . in their legislative functions. &quot; But in a pair of rulings siding with Yagman , federal judges in California have concluded that lawmakers are not immune from damage claims in certain circumstances . First , U . S . District Judge J . Spencer Letts in Los Angeles said that the 10 council_members who voted to shield Gates and the other officers were not &quot; dealing with legislation which will affect the public at_large , &quot; but rather were taking one side in a legal dispute over police brutality . By doing so , the council_members could be &quot; giving complete license for bad-faith acts &quot; by the police , the judge said , and therefore they can be held liable for their actions . In March , the U . S . 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , whose jurisdiction covers the entire West , affirmed Letts ' decision and ruled that lawmakers are not entitled to &quot; a cloak of absolute immunity &quot; when they &quot; perform an administrative , not a legislative , act. &quot; City Atty . James K . Hahn appealed_to the high_court , arguing that this rule , if allowed to stand , could &quot; chill &quot; elected officials in the exercise of their duties . But the high_court issued a one-line order Monday dismissing the appeal . Lawyers who represent local_governments said that Monday ' s high_court decision will frighten elected representatives . &quot; Particularly in the small jurisdictions where you have the real citizen-legislators , this will have a profound impact , &quot; said attorney Timothy Coates , who filed a brief on behalf of city and county officials in 18 California jurisdictions urging the high_court to intervene in the case . While lawyers know of no instance in which elected officials have been forced to pay damages , they say that there has been &quot; an explosion of litigation &quot; naming elected officials . The case against the Los Angeles council_members now moves to trial . Donald Vincent , supervising deputy city attorney , said that he will ask Letts to rule that council_members are entitled to &quot; qualified immunity &quot; from the damage claim on grounds that they acted in good_faith and without malice . But Yagman said he will present evidence showing that the council routinely paid huge damage claims against police_officers , which should lead to a large damage verdict against members . If so , the council_members could appeal the verdict to the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco and to the U . S . Supreme Court . Savage reported from Washington and Berger reported from Los Angeles . History of Case That Prompted Ruling Feb . 12 , 1990 : Four men break_into a McDonald ' s restaurant in Sunland , forcing manager Robbin L . Cox to open the safe at gunpoint . Despite a 911 call from Cox , officers with the LAPD ' s Special Investigation Section , already outside the restaurant , decline to move_in . When the robbers emerge to make their getaway , the officers open_fire , allegedly after one of the men points a gun at them . Three of the men are killed and one seriously wounded in a barrage of 23 shotgun blasts and 12 rounds fired from the officers ' handguns . The robbers ' weapons are later found to be pellet guns . The dead men are identified as Herbert Burgos , 27 ; Jesus Arango , 25 , and Javier Trevino Cruz , 20 . Injured was Alfredo Olivas , 19 . Feb . 21 , 1990 : Families of the dead and injured men file a $ 10-million federal civil-rights lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles , Mayor Tom Bradley and Police_Chief Daryl F . Gates , alleging that excessive force was used and describing the mission of the SIS as that of a &quot; death squad. &quot; July 24 , 1990 : The lone survivor of the four robbers , Alfredo Olivas , is sentenced to 17 years in prison . Olivas pleaded guilty on 10 counts of robbery stemming from a string of holdups of fast-food restaurants , including the Sunland McDonald ' s . Jan . 25 , 1991 : In the second lawsuit filed_in the case , restaurant manager Cox sues the SIS officers and the city , contending that the officers should have stopped the four men from breaking_into the restaurant or halted the robbery while it was in_progress . Jan . 9 , 1992 : Trial in the lawsuit brought by the robbers ' families begins in U.S. District Court before Judge J . Spencer Letts . March 30 , 1992 : A 10-juror panel finds in favor of the families , assessing $ 20 # 505 in punitive damages against Chief Gates and $ 23 # 537 against the nine officers involved in the shooting . Jurors say they purposely set the amount low because they believe the chief and his officers should be forced to pay_out of_their_own pockets . Despite comments from some Los Angeles City_Council members that Gates and the officers should pay , the council a month later decides -- behind closed doors -- to use city funds . April 1 , 1992 : Stephen Yagman , the attorney representing the families , files another lawsuit against the City_Council and police officials . The $ 20-million suit , denounced as &quot; extortion &quot; and a &quot; threat &quot; by city officials , is identical to the first suit but is filed on behalf of Johanna Trevino , daughter of one of the slain robbers , Javier Trevino . The girl was born six days after her father was killed . Her suit follows a legal precedent set the previous year allowing a child to sue for damages even though he or she was not yet born when a parent was killed . July 20 , 1992 : Despite city protests that its council has &quot; legislative immunity , &quot; U.S. District Court Judge Letts rules that council_members must stand trial in the lawsuit filed on behalf of Johanna Trevino . The city appeals his decision . Jan . 12 , 1994 : Los Angeles County Superior_Court Judge Charles W . Stoll rules that the city of Los Angeles is not liable for damages suffered by McDonald ' s restaurant manager Cox . Feb . 28 , 1994 : Ruling against the city ' s appeal in the Trevino lawsuit , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously decides that City_Council members can be individually sued if they use taxpayer dollars to pay punitive damage awards for a police_officer found liable for brutality . Oct . 11 , 1994 : The U.S. Supreme Court lets the appellate_court ruling stand . Oct . 25 , 1994 : Trial of the lawsuit filed on behalf of Johanna Trevino is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court .</TEXT>
