   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA TO KEEP TROOPS IN FORMER SOVIET LANDS ; MILITARY : ASSERTION RAISES ALARM IN BALTICS . BUT MOSCOW SAYS REPUBLICS ' APPROVAL WILL BE SOUGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a sign of resurgent Russian nationalism , Foreign Minister Andrei D . Kozyrev asserted Tuesday that Russia must maintain a long-term &quot; military presence &quot; in the former Soviet republics beyond its borders . The statement , made to Russian ambassadors gathered_in Moscow and reported by two Russian news_agencies , raised alarm in Estonia and Latvia that President Boris N . Yeltsin might be reversing his pledge to withdraw the last 20 # 000 former Soviet troops from those Baltic nations by the end of 1994 . A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman , Galina E . Sidorova , said later that Kozyrev ' s statement &quot; has nothing to do with the Baltics. &quot; She said Russia plans to keep its troops only in those countries that agree to let them stay . Even so , his remarks were the strongest indication , though not the first , that Russia wants to have a permanent military role in what Russians call the &quot; near abroad &quot; rather than bring all its troops home by 1995 as Yeltsin once promised . Russia inherited the bulk of the Soviet army that collapsed in 1991 and maintains an estimated 250 # 000 troops in 12 of the 14 other ex-Soviet republics -- all but Lithuania and Azerbaijan . Russian troops are a source of conflict in some , particularly Georgia and Tajikistan . Kozyrev reasserted the army ' s intention to defend ethnic Russians and keep peace in such countries , despite Yeltsin ' s failure to win President Clinton ' s endorsement of a special Russian sphere_of_influence at their summit here last week . The foreign_minister ' s speech may have been tailored to shifting political currents at_home on the eve of a government shake-up . Key members of the government ' s reform wing are fighting for their Cabinet jobs in the wake of the stronger showing in last month ' s parliamentary elections by ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who favors conquering Russia ' s neighbors by force . Kozyrev , a reformer who opposes Russian bullying , has been voicing a more assertive position in foreign_policy since the election and is widely expected to keep his post . &quot; We should not withdraw from those regions that have been the sphere of Russian interests for centuries , and we should not fear the words ( military presence ) , &quot; he told the ambassadors , according to accounts by the Itar-Tass and Interfax news_agencies . &quot; Although military domination is not in Moscow ' s interests , it would be dangerous to create a vacuum. &quot; Because Kozyrev ' s audience included Russian ambassadors to the Baltic nations , officials in Estonia and Latvia assumed his remarks were aimed at them . His statement came a week after military commanders sent new orders to Russian troops in those countries to respond with gunfire to any provocations . Latvian Prime_Minister Valdis Birkavs said Kozyrev ' s statement meant &quot; a serious change in the policy of Russia &quot; and &quot; a threat to Latvia ' s sovereignty. &quot; In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States cannot accept a decision to station Russian troops in any former Soviet republic against the wishes of the local_government . He said the U.S._government is seeking a clarification of Kozyrev ' s remarks , since Yeltsin had promised Clinton last week to withdraw from Estonia and Latvia . As Yeltsin discussed the Cabinet makeup Tuesday with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , the economic reform team identified with the president for the past two years was unraveling . The ruble plunged in value for a second day , dropping to 1 # 504 per dollar from 1 # 354 at the start of the week . Finance_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov , the leading reformer still in office after Economy Minister Yegor T . Gaidar ' s resignation Sunday , was fighting what appeared to be a losing battle for his job . Fyodorov , credited with stabilizing the ruble and cutting inflation from a monthly rate of 30 % a year ago to 12 % last month , threatened to quit unless he was given a higher rank than two of his foes -- Central_Bank President Viktor V . Gerashchenko and Alexander K . Zaveryukha , who oversees agricultural policy . After Fyodorov was rebuffed , he insisted on the two men ' s resignation , but Itar-Tass said Chernomyrdin rejected that demand too .
