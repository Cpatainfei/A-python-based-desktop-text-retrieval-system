   <HEADLINE> TENTATIVE ACCORD REACHED IN S.F. NEWSPAPER STRIKE ; LABOR : UNION WORKERS MAY RETURN TO THE JOB AS EARLY AS MONDAY . CONTRACT CALLS FOR ANNUAL RAISE OF 3 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Picket_lines were disbanded Saturday after a tentative agreement was reached for striking workers of San Francisco ' s two daily newspapers . The proposal would end a strike that began Nov . 1 , when 2 # 600 reporters , salespeople , printers and delivery drivers walked_off the job after more_than a year of fruitless negotiations over salaries and other issues . One person died and several people were injured during the strike against the San Francisco Examiner and San Francisco Chronicle , the first walkout since a 52-day strike 26 years ago . Workers will vote on the contract today . The Chronicle and Examiner might be produced with union workers as early as Monday , according to the San Francisco Free Press , a newspaper put_out by striking reporters . Workers would get an average annual raise of 3 % under the contract , which would expire in 1998 , according to the Free Press . They had asked_for a 3.5 % raise ; management had offered a 2.46 % raise . Also , all_the workers will return to work without any threat of discipline except those convicted of a felony or those who &quot; committed acts with the intent of causing bodily harm or serious property damage. &quot; Other details of the contract were not released . The tentative agreement was reached late Friday and announced early Saturday by the office of Mayor Frank Jordan , who stepped into the dispute eight days ago . &quot; This has been a long and tiring process , &quot; Jordan said . &quot; All San Franciscans , myself included , look_forward to seeing the Chronicle and Examiner back on doorsteps and in the news racks. &quot; The two papers , published under a joint operating agreement , are overseen by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency . The Conference of Newspaper Unions is the umbrella group for eight unions representing the workers . Picket_lines came_down about 4:35 a.m. , moments after the agreement was announced . The unions also withdrew their advertising and circulation boycotts . The few pickets on_duty cheered the announcement . &quot; I ' m ecstatic , &quot; said John Heise , a Teamster driver . &quot; I have a family , three kids , a wife . She ' s been driving me crazy for days. &quot; One striking trucker died a week ago when he was electrocuted , apparently trying to cut power to one of the newspapers ' distribution plants . The machinists union , the one striking group not represented by the conference , reached a tentative settlement late Thursday . &quot; The strike was needless and tragic , but I am glad it ' s over , &quot; Examiner Editor and Publisher William R . Hearst III said .</TEXT>
