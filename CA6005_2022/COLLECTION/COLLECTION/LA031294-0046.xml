   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CONCESSIONS SHOW JAPAN YIELDING TO U.S. PRESSURE ; TRADE : IN LATEST MOVE , AUTO_MAKERS ARE ASKED TO PLAN MORE PURCHASES OF AMERICAN PARTS . EXPERTS SAY MORE DISPUTES LOOM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under immense pressure from the United States over its huge trade surpluses , Japan has begun making concessions to American demands . But whether Tokyo will offer enough to head_off a worsening of the trade dispute remains highly doubtful . An argument over access to Japan ' s cellular_telephone market is very close to settlement , and Japanese auto_makers have begun announcing steps to boost the purchase of American auto parts . But even if the high-profile conflicts in these two areas are resolved , other disputes are waiting , on topics ranging from semiconductors to insurance to intellectual property_rights . Also , some analysts believe that by waiting so_long to yield in these areas , Japan has lost much of the benefit it could have gained by taking similar actions months ago . &quot; The Japanese stall and stall and stall and there ' s no movement , and then the other side screams . . . and they try to do something , &quot; said Paul Summerville , an analyst at Lehman Bros . Japan Inc. &quot; I think that now the screaming got so loud , and ( the threat of U.S. sanctions ) is so scary for the Japanese , they ' re caving in. &quot; The latest Japanese concession came Friday , when Hiroshi Kumagai , minister of international trade and industry , told a news_conference that the Japanese government expects auto_makers to map_out , by the end of March , their plans to boost purchases of U.S. auto parts . His statement provides an official boost to a process that has already begun . &quot; If nothing is done , U.S. sanctions will come one day , &quot; Kumagai declared . &quot; I believe private companies understand this well. &quot; Mitsubishi Motors Corp . announced Wednesday that it plans to import about $ 2 billion worth of U.S. auto parts in the 1995 fiscal_year . Last Saturday , Mazda Motor Corp . said it plans to purchase $ 2.4 billion worth of U.S. components in fiscal 1997 . Japanese media have reported that Toyota Motor Corp . will unveil a plan to purchase $ 6 billion of U.S. parts in fiscal 1996 . Stung by Japan ' s longest postwar recession , auto firms may actually be quite willing to dramatically increase imports of foreign parts , now that the strong yen has made imports even more of a bargain . Japanese automobile makers &quot; are not profitable as they ' re currently structured , &quot; Summerville said . &quot; They have to take_advantage of the strong yen to import parts . . . . They can use this pressure from the state as an excuse to jettison their smaller suppliers. &quot; In the cellular_telephone dispute involving Motorola Inc. and the Japanese telecommunications firm Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp . ( IDO ) , further progress was made Friday toward finalizing the details of a deal that would provide the U.S. firm with greater access to Japan ' s market . &quot; It is in the final stage to finish_up the negotiations , but there is still a possibility to change some parts , &quot; said Miyuki Ochi , a spokesperson for Nippon Motorola Ltd . An agreement between Motorola and IDO would head_off the threat of U.S. sanctions on this issue . But a string of other conflicts loom on the horizon . The next focus of attention may be semiconductors . Japanese and U.S. officials will meet in Hawaii March 22-23 to discuss calculations of the foreign share_in Japan ' s semiconductor market for the final quarter of last year . In the third quarter , this figure stood at 18.1 % . If the final-quarter share is less than 20 % -- a goal mentioned in a 1991 trade pact -- the U.S. side might initiate steps leading toward sanctions on the issue . Many analysts believe that only a strong economic recovery in Japan would provide the domestic demand needed to pull_in enough imports to significantly cut the nation ' s huge trade surplus with the United States , which ran at $ 59.3 billion last year . But no end to the recession is in_sight . The long-festering trade imbalance has left the Japanese and American sides caught_up in &quot; posturing and confusion , &quot; said T.W. Kang , a management_consultant at Global Synergy Associates . The threat of U.S. sanctions may bring positive results in opening_up Japanese markets , but the risk remains that the conflict could get_out of hand , Kang said . Mutual dependency exerts a dampening effect on extreme actions by either side , but it provides no absolute guarantee against a mutually destructive pattern of retaliation and counter-retaliation , he said . &quot; If America says , ' Hey , we ' re willing to shoot ourselves in the foot and go_through a certain degree of pain to rectify this basic situation , ' I think that ' s where things get kind of dangerous , &quot; Kang said . &quot; You cannot predict all_the fallout of such an action. &quot;</TEXT>
