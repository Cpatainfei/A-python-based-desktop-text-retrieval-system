   <HEADLINE> MOSCOW PD BLUES ; THEIR CARS ARE JUNK , PAY STINKS , THEY DON ' T ALWAYS KNOW WHO ' S IN CHARGE . BUT WHAT REALLY OVERWHELMS RUSSIAN COPS IS SOMETHING NEW : BIG-TIME CAPITALIST CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inside a ramshackle brown brick police_station , Lt . Col . Mikhail Sergeivich Pertsev absorbs the latest news crackling over the police band . &quot; A man with a submachine_gun just threatened a man in a car , &quot; he says gloomily . &quot; The man lost the car. &quot; A carjacking ? Where ? &quot; Not far from here . An area that used to have a lot of construction . Huts were built for the workers to live_in , and there was lots of fighting with knives. &quot; Pertsev pauses . &quot; We call this district Chicago. &quot; As chief of one of Moscow ' s smaller police_stations , in the northern part of the city , Pertsev seems to possess a bottomless store of good_humor , which he needs . He presides over 110 officers -- &quot; We should have 120 , but no one wants to be a policeman anymore &quot; -- and a fleet of seven squad_cars , two of which don ' t work . &quot; They are like the Aurora boat that started the Bolshevik Revolution and is now a museum in St . Petersburg , &quot; Pertsev says wryly . &quot; They do not move. &quot; Sitting behind the desk in his no-frills office , Pertsev proudly hoists a brand new police radio . &quot; It ' s a Motorola , and we have our American colleagues to thank for it , &quot; he notes . &quot; Seven came last week . Unfortunately , we need 40 or 50. &quot; Before the radios arrived , Pertsev ' s men relied_on Hungarian-made sets . &quot; The Hungarians probably felt hurt with us after 1956 , &quot; he offers slyly . &quot; Their radios only caused trouble. &quot; Immovable cars and balky radios are the least of the problems that dog Moscow ' s 100 # 000 officers . An escalating crime spree has exploded -- sometimes literally , with grenades -- throughout the streets of this city of 9 million . Cars disappear in the night , a new old-style mafia operates with reckless abandon , and guns abound , thanks to the disintegration of the Red Army , which has made stolen weapons commonplace on the black_market . Even when a criminal is caught red-handed , police may have to let him go . Russia ' s criminal justice code , enacted in 1961 , did not envision many of the new order ' s cunning crimes . Added_to all this is a departmental reorganization that has blurred territorial boundaries , confusing just about everyone . &quot; We are the only state system that has not collapsed , &quot; Pertsev laments . &quot; But that isn ' t saying much. &quot; Vladimir Vershkov , a ruddy-cheeked lieutenant_colonel in_charge of press relations , shakes his head at the insanity of it all . &quot; Every day , we have explosions , stolen autos , robberies , apartment assaults , &quot; he says , using the Russian vernacular for burglary . &quot; Such things we have never seen before. &quot; Indeed , last summer , a man in a policeman ' s uniform entered one of Moscow ' s new commercial_banks , pretending to check_out how the bank was performing its duties . Right behind him marched seven submachine-gun-toting accomplices . A four-hour standoff with the police ensued . The result : one cop dead , two others wounded , six suspects apprehended , two still at_large , a police_force -- and a city -- dumbfounded . &quot; This was our first bank stickup , &quot; says one high-ranking police official . &quot; The state took it very hard. &quot; But not as hard as the December murder of Nikolai P . Likhachev , chairman of the gigantic Rosselkhozbank , who was gunned_down in his Moscow apartment -- one of 30 bank officials murdered last year . On the day of his funeral , banks and currency exchanges closed to protest the government ' s inability to protect them . Seizing the moment , hard-liner Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky raised crime to a political issue by blaming violence on people from former Soviet republics . Before former Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev , and then Boris N . Yeltsin , opened_up Russia to a free-market economy , there had been no crime in Moscow , officially , because socialism was a perfect society . Well , maybe a little crime . Desperate for car parts , citizens routinely stole each other ' s windshield_wipers , while party officials pocketed great gobs of state money , but otherwise there was little to steal . Now , with the influx of foreign hard currency and a proliferation of commercial ventures , Russians are experiencing one of the ancillary fruits of capitalism : big-time crime . It ' s a growth_industry . In the past few years , three tabloids have appeared , each dealing with only one subject -- crime -- which is often the lead_story on TV news as well . This is understandable . During 1993 , about 19 # 000 major crimes were committed in Moscow , compared to 302 # 000 in Los Angeles : While one in 11 Angelenos was victimized , only one in about 500 Muscovites felt the sting of a major crime -- but that ' s a 39 % increase over the same period in 1992 . Still , while Los Angeles averaged 78 murders a month , Moscow averaged 100 , up 55 % from the previous year , and &quot; heavy wounds , &quot; from which the victim may or may_not eventually expire , were up 34 % . Auto thefts , carjackings and car robberies are running at about 675 a month . When the year began , five or six cars were stolen a day ; during one recent night in Moscow , 102 cars vanished . &quot; How many auto thefts do you have in Los Angeles ? &quot; asks Vershkov , the press relations man . &quot; About 70 # 000 a year. &quot; Vershkov blinks . &quot; Oh. &quot; &quot; But we ' ve been at it longer. &quot; More interesting are statistics involving police_action . During 1993 , they fired their guns on 1 # 358 occasions , while in Los Angeles , police used their weapons in only 144 incidents . &quot; We are allowed to shoot at people if we order them to stop and they don ' t , &quot; explains Alexander Shestakov , 39 , a veteran of the Moscow traffic police . &quot; If a child has a gun and is a threat , I will have to use my gun . I will first shoot into the air . Then at his feet , legs or arms. &quot; Which explains why , a_few months after the Rodney King beating incident , a member of a delegation of Russian police visiting Los Angeles told Chief Daryl F . Gates , &quot; We don ' t understand all_the fuss . In Russia , we would have just shot him. &quot; Use-of-force definitions aside , the average Moscow policeman is much like an L.A. cop : overworked , underpaid , ill-equipped , outnumbered . The two departments even share a strategy : community-based policing . In Moscow , it exists in the form of one officer , called an uchastkovy , in each small police district , who is housed in a state-funded flat and whose job is to know his neighborhood . &quot; He is supposed to know how people deal with each other , who drinks too_much , who might be in need of medical help , &quot; says one official . &quot; Most of the time , he stays in his office and people come_to him , but he also makes the rounds . If a crime is committed , he is usually called_in . He knows the people better than anybody. &quot; Despite this coziness , relations with the community are , if possible , even worse than in Los Angeles . If some Angelenos call LAPD officers brutal , almost all Muscovites call their cops criminals . &quot; Money , money , money ! &quot; shouts Alex Belabin , my driver in Moscow , every time we pass a white-gloved traffic_cop standing over some doomed motorist . It is a common sight . &quot; Russian people hate the police , &quot; says Belabin with passion . &quot; Every day , they pull me over . ' Hello , Alex ! ' Money , money , money ! &quot; Fines for traffic infractions must be paid on the spot . If the motorist doesn ' t have the dough on him , the officer may follow him home to collect it or confiscate his license . But everyone knows you can buy your way_out of almost any violation , even drunk driving , by slipping the cop several thousand rubles . Although this keeps the motorist ' s record blemish-free , Russians resent the practice and refer to traffic_cops as milkmen -- people who milk the public . &quot; We have jokes about the police , &quot; says one young_woman . &quot; An officer tells his superior he ' s getting_married , and he needs more money . The superior hands him a portable stop sign. &quot; But it ' s not just the traffic_cops who have their hands_out . With the advent of commercial ventures come commercial bribes . A small-business owner without the thicket of proper licenses and state approvals can simply pay_off an investigating officer to ignore the infractions . None of this is news to Pertsev . &quot; We have policemen who take bribes , &quot; he says with a weary shrug . &quot; Things do not run too smoothly here. &quot; SPACE IN MOSCOW IS SO TIGHT THAT POLICE_STATIONS TURN UP IN THE oddest places . One I visited consumes half of an apartment_building ; another is located in a taxi park . Mikhail Pertsev ' s Khovrino Municipal Police_Station is housed in a former school built_in 1946 . Dark , dank and dungeon-like , it ' s a prime example of Russia ' s crumbling infrastructure . Stairs are broken , floor tiles cracked ; paint peels_off walls ; hallway ceilings are a mass of tangled wires . Many overhead fixtures lack bulbs ; the bathroom is beyond description . None of this seems to faze Pertsev . &quot; I work 12 hours a day , &quot; he says with feeling , &quot; though two or three nights a week , I stay longer , till 1 or 3 in the morning , depending . I also work weekends . This summer , I was supposed to have 50 days vacation . But after 20 , I was relieved to be called_back because of so_much crime. &quot; Pertsev , a stocky , dark-haired 43-year-old , tackles his job with an old-fashioned sense of pride and responsibility . The chunk of Moscow he watches_over , a &quot; sleeping district &quot; of 70 # 000 , is where he grew_up and where he still resides with his wife and two sons . Thus , he knows where all_the bodies are buried , or at least where they live . He feels protective toward his men -- even toward the neighborhood hooligans , some of whom he has helped find jobs . But , as is true everywhere , the neighborhood has changed . Pertsev became a police_officer in 1979 , after serving six years in the Soviet military . &quot; When I was young and lighter in weight , I could bring_back five or six criminals at a time , &quot; he recalls . &quot; I didn ' t need to carry a gun . They would n ' t resist me . Now , we all walk_around with submachine guns. &quot; On cue , two officers burst into Pertsev ' s office to show me . Each wears a helmet and , over his clothes , a bulletproof_vest that seems a closer relation_to knight ' s armor than to the light Kevlar vests common in America . Strapped to each belt is a 9-millimeter pistol . In their hands , Kalashnikov submachine_guns . &quot; Whenever we get a call that a crime is in_progress , these are the men we send_out , &quot; Pertsev says . Do they use motorcycles ? Pertsev grins . &quot; We have some , but they ' re old and can ' t be used in a chase. &quot; He jumps up . &quot; Come , I ' ll show you around. &quot; Pertsev flings open an office door and points to the desks , bragging that he bought them from an old hotel . Then , throwing open another door , he announces proudly , &quot; This is our gym . Our officers built it themselves. &quot; The drab room , maybe 15 feet by 10 feet , is two-thirds consumed by blue floor mats surrounded by ropes . A makeshift slant board , balanced on the seat of a broken-back chair , is crammed between two rusting sets of barbells . It gets_worse . The forensics lab , housed in a tiny , gray , damp room with a single fluorescent bulb , contains only an ancient photo enlarger . More sophisticated work , such_as analyzing fingerprints , must be done at headquarters . In December , 1992 , Pertsev ' s station was issued three new Russian-made Moskvitch police_cars . &quot; By January , &quot; he says , &quot; we were making repairs. &quot; Although the cars are serviced at a friendly auto shop , where the owner charges for parts but not labor , Pertsev confesses , &quot; After we use_up our budget , we have to pay_for parts out of_our_own pockets. &quot; But -- how ? Pertsev makes 150 # 000 rubles a month , about $ 150 , although the steady decline of the ruble makes_it worth less every week . In addition , because he has 20 years service ( including his stint in the military ) , he is eligible to collect 25 % of his pension , which amounts to another 7 # 000 rubles ( $ 7 ) a month . &quot; A kilo of sausage costs 10 # 000 rubles , &quot; Pertsev says bleakly , &quot; if it ' s good sausage. &quot; He brightens . &quot; But let ' s talk_about crime. &quot; Back in his office , Pertsev removes a VCR from a locked cabinet . He plugs it into the TV and pops_in a cassette . A bright , clear tape shows officers searching 25 &quot; mafia people &quot; who had been brought_in for questioning . Each of the bad_guys wears a black leather jacket over a bulletproof_vest . Many carry wads of U.S. dollars . One has several small metal balls -- &quot; new armaments , &quot; Pertsev calls them -- that , if thrown at the right velocity and target ( the forehead ) , can kill . Painstakingly , the officers study each man ' s passport . &quot; Look_at this one , &quot; Pertsev says , tapping the TV , as the camera focuses_on the passport of a young , dark-haired man . Pertsev laughs . &quot; The photo is of Yeltsin ! &quot; Even with Pertsev ' s force doing its best to nail mafia hoods and everyday crooks , his men can ' t always put them in jail . Buying or carrying firearms is strictly illegal and is punishable by up_to five years in jail . But proving possession is not a simple matter . &quot; You catch a man with a submachine_gun , and he says he found it on the street , &quot; Vladimir Vershkov says . &quot; There is nothing we can do. &quot; Auto thefts , one of the major sources of crime in Moscow , are also difficult to prosecute . If a criminal is caught driving a stolen car , he can simply say he &quot; borrowed &quot; it . Unless the police can find evidence of his intent to dismantle and resell it , at worst he ' ll have to pay a fine . &quot; Recently , we saw a man stealing a car , &quot; Pertsev recounts . &quot; We chased him and finally shot him in the arm . He was fined 900 rubles &quot; -- less than a dollar . Most likely , however , the man was part of a ring . Another man will change the numbers on the engine , another will provide false documents , a fourth will actually resell it . To get a conviction for theft , the police must implicate all_of them . &quot; Three years ago , the criminals started coming_in from the southern republics or Caucasus , &quot; Pertsev says , echoing a typical Moscow explanation for the crime_wave . &quot; We have a Chechen mafia , a Georgian mafia , an Azerbaijan mafia . We call these people our black brothers. &quot; Still , these problems may be somewhat overblown . &quot; The police probably forgot to tell you that it ' s not really the laws that are holding them back , &quot; says Sergei Litvinov , a former Siberian police_detective who now works as an investigator in San Francisco . &quot; Five or 10 years ago , when Russia had a conviction rate of 99 % , they didn ' t need to collect evidence . Now , with the slight democratization that ' s going_on , they must fingerprint and nail their case down . They ' re still not used to this . Like everything in Russia , the police are inefficient. &quot; As the police try to cope_with the underworld , their superiors are knotted in hierarchical problems . Since early 1991 , Moscow ' s police have been pawns in a political game . Police_chiefs and district_lines were reshuffled at least five times , with the latest municipal_government reorganization only producing more headaches . Formerly , each of Moscow ' s 182 police_stations reported to one of the 33 municipal districts , which reported directly to headquarters . Now the 33 districts have been reshaped into 10 sectors called okrugs , which has flummoxed just about everyone . &quot; Nothing seems to mesh , &quot; says Vladimir Zolotnitzki , a lieutenant clutching an Ed McBain police novel , who works in public affairs at headquarters . &quot; If a murder takes_place , police will come from headquarters , from the okrug and the local police_station . You have to call a prosecutor as well . But the prosecutors ' districts are different from ours , and nobody knows which prosecutor to call. &quot; Arguments break_out as some crimes attract police from two local stations -- or no one shows_up at all . Before the reorganization , Pertsev ' s station and four others reported to a district station ; now 17 stations report to the local okrug . &quot; When we have a meeting , 60 heads of departments come , &quot; Pertsev says . &quot; The new system is like a monster. &quot; Finding recruits to feed this monster isn ' t easy either . The department has numerous positions open that it cannot fill . The lure of becoming a police_officer is fading fast . Not only can more money be made working security for private concerns , but the public ' s distrust of the police is hardly_a major selling point . According to Pertsev , a policeman can equal a month ' s salary through bribes . &quot; Even though I am shorthanded , &quot; he says , &quot; I have fired five men for taking bribes and two for being drunk. &quot; Later , Pertsev takes a tour of his district , a mix of quiet residential streets and bustling boulevards dotted with the usual stranded motorists staring vacantly under raised hoods at stalled engines . He stops at a local market , where individual sellers of produce and goods have set_up stalls . Pertsev greets many vendors and the market manager by name , checking to make_sure everything is OK . This is mafia territory , he points_out , ripe for people with protection schemes . A few blocks later , Pertsev pulls_up in front of a kiosk . A sort of Russian-style 7-Eleven , kiosks have blossomed along boulevards under the new free-market economy . They are open all hours , sell everything from cigarettes to shoes and , like their American counterparts , are routinely held_up . The week before , an armed robber busted into this one . One of the two owners wrestled the gun from the intruder and held him until the police came . The owner points to several bullet_holes that bored into the ceiling during the struggle for the gun . &quot; See ? &quot; he says with a grin . &quot; We have a little bit of Los Angeles right in here. &quot; PETROVKA 38 -- POLICE_HEADQUARTERS -- IS A YELLOW SIX-STORY BUILDING set behind a wrought-iron gate . It , too , is in need of repair . Long stretches of hallway are unaccountably dark , the elevator may or may_not work . On a table in the bare lobby is a picture of a slain cop , killed several nights before by anti-Yeltsin demonstrators . A vase with several flowers stands beside the photograph . Petrovka 38 contains administrative offices , forensics labs and some citywide units . In Room 335 , heavyset Lt . Col . Anatoly Ilchenko , wearing a dark suit , dark shirt and dark tie , looks_to be just what he is : deputy head of the organized crime department . &quot; Moscow is like America in the ' 30s , &quot; he says . &quot; I think. &quot; Until 1989 , Moscow police didn ' t have an organized-crime unit . But by last February , the unit had expanded into a full-fledged department , staffed by 20 to 25 officers at each okrug and 500 more at headquarters . &quot; One of the biggest problems , &quot; Ilchenko says , repeating what seems to be the party_line , &quot; is we have no legislation for organized_crime . We need something like your RICO laws , which deal with the formation of criminal enterprises. &quot; Although Ilchenko dismisses newspaper reports of organized_crime as grossly exaggerated , he concedes that , &quot; While only 1 % of all crime is mafia-related , most organized crime is not obvious . When people pay racketeers , they don ' t tell us. &quot; Indeed , almost everyone one encounters in Moscow has a mafia-type story . Especially kiosk owners . Rather than be robbed repeatedly , many pay protection money . Individuals who set_up money-changing operations are also strong-armed . So are Moscow ' s 60 casinos . &quot; We hire members of the OMON ( Moscow ' s equivalent of SWAT ) to man the front_door , &quot; says Charles Pancoast , an American who is chief financial_officer for the exclusive Casino Royale , an elegantly decorated club housed in the former residence of Czar Nicholas I . &quot; Anyone who tries to mess with us will have to deal with them first. &quot; More common is the story of Michael Boulygin , who has built a flourishing translation business for foreigners in need of English interpreters . A fellow he went_to school with approached him : &quot; You need protection , &quot; he told Boulygin . For 30 # 000 rubles a month ( $ 30 ) , this friend ' s &quot; friends &quot; would take_care of any problems Boulygin might have . Says Boulygin ' s wife , Svetlana : &quot; People don ' t trust the police . What these protection people are doing is taking_over some functions the police can ' t handle . We don ' t mind paying. &quot; According to the police , even banks hire racketeers -- to find the criminals who steal their money . In the past , there was a national_bank , which did business with the smaller state_banks , and authorities knew exactly what to do if something went awry , which , of course , it never did . Russia now has 2 # 000 commercial_banks , and their relations with state_banks are not regulated . According to Vladimir Objedkov , head of the department of economic crime , &quot; We don ' t know who ' s responsible_for commercial_banks . People are taking_advantage of this confusion. &quot; He is sitting on a dais , flanked by seven other police officials at the weekly press briefing at Petrovka 38 . A dozen local print reporters are seated in the small auditorium , taking copious notes . Objedkov delivers an anecdotal rundown of the recent crimes in his department . &quot; Credit robbery is something new , &quot; he says . &quot; A young entrepreneur will set_up a company using false documents . He ' ll get credit from banks , then disappear , changing the money into hard currency and transferring it abroad. &quot; Often , Objedkov goes_on , the banker is in cahoots with the entrepreneur , accepting false documents knowingly for a piece of the profits . &quot; But then , &quot; he says with a quick smile , &quot; the Russians have always been very inventive. &quot; And daring . A company called Finstrakh ran TV commercials with this message : &quot; Invest your money with us . If you invest dollars , you ' ll see a 300 % return in a year . If rubles , a 100 % return. &quot; People showed_up at Finstrakh ' s offices in droves . That a small police unit of three officers was operating in the same building only made them feel safer . The Finstrakh people were clever : When one man arrived with 1.5 million rubles to invest , they turned him away . The thinking ? Anyone with that much money would undoubtedly hire a racketeer to come_after them when they absconded with the money . Which , of course , they did . FROM THE BRIGHTLY LIT rooms of Petrovka 38 ' s command center , a big room of telephone switchboards , the cops monitor the city . &quot; With our computer_network , we can alert any police_station or patrol_car , individually or all at once , &quot; says Col . Alexander Denisov , the on-duty unit chief . &quot; Within three or four minutes , a car can reach where the crime is committed. &quot; Sure . &quot; Right now , we have 120 cars out from this , our central unit . All together , we can have 250 to 300 cars out. &quot; It is noon , and , according to Denisov , 7 # 000 cops are_on duty , including patrols , traffic police and detectives . An enormous relief_map of Moscow covers the far wall . Small light_bulbs indicate the positions of cars on_duty . In the next room , two men sit behind a switchboard , receiving and relaying critical information . &quot; We have direct communications with all okrugs and police_cars , &quot; says Lt . Col . Victor Pospelov . &quot; Also , we can contact the power supply service , the fire_department and ambulances. &quot; How many crimes today ? &quot; Since midnight , one murder , one assault , one robbery and 45 car thefts , not counting fires or car accidents. &quot; The city ' s emergency response system is upstairs . Ten phone_lines are hooked to 02 , the Moscow equivalent of 911 , staffed by 10 policewomen . &quot; Men can ' t stand working here , &quot; Denisov volunteers . &quot; But women are very good at it. &quot; Three of the women look_up and smile agreeably . The typical cop seems either to come_to his profession from the military or after studying at institutions like the Academy of Internal Affairs or the Militia Academy . Women are trained in non-physical work_at the police_academy , then carefully slotted into jobs that keep them behind desks . They operate the new computers that run fingerprints , while men are assigned to the crime scene to collect the fingerprints . When asked about this , Victor Petchnikov , the tall , curly-haired head of criminal police at one okrug , says with a patient smile , &quot; The criminal police have no regular hours . Women need to be home to take_care of their husbands and children . They prefer it. &quot; So it is women who handle the 20 # 000 to 24 # 000 calls that are made to 02 each 24 hours . Some calls are from people asking_for information , but even so , Denisov boasts , all calls are handled efficiently and promptly . &quot; Then how come people complain they can never get_through ? &quot; I ask . Denisov smiles benignly . &quot; Obviously , they have dialed the wrong number , &quot; he says . IT IS 9 P.M. ON A CHILLY Moscow night as three patrol officers begin the final hours of their shift . In Moscow , cops go_out in threes . All ride in the car with submachine_guns in their laps . A call comes_over the radio reporting that a man with a submachine_gun and several automatic weapons is terrorizing someone in an apartment_building . &quot; Practically every day , criminals use automatic weapons , &quot; says Capt . Vladimir Kulkov , fingering his own . These officers are part of a new unit that strictly does patrol duty . Surprisingly , their 2-year-old Moskvitch seems to function , and their working conditions seem superior to what I have so far seen . They work 12-hour shifts for two days , then have two days_off . Their new station , now under construction , will contain a locker_room , sauna , shower , gym , shooting range and garage . They even have their own shrink . &quot; We have a woman psychologist at our station , &quot; Jr . Lt . Nikolai Shliaptsev says . &quot; Sometimes you feel tired , or something goes_wrong . She knows when someone needs her . She makes you feel better. &quot; Until recently , patrol_cars were assigned to each police_station . &quot; Now they have very few and are used mostly to respond to family disputes or burglaries , &quot; Shliaptsev says . &quot; We assist them on the calls , but basically , we are out patrolling the streets. &quot; Their territory , just north of the city_center , includes woodsy residential streets , from which cars are routinely stolen , as well as the Central Exhibition Center and a major metro stop ringed by numerous kiosks . Most are open until 11 p.m. , some all night . &quot; Before , nothing was open at this hour , &quot; Shliaptsev says . &quot; The other night , we noticed two suspicious-looking men from the Caucasus . One started running . He had a submachine_gun under his overcoat . We hauled them in. &quot; But tonight is eerily quiet . &quot; We arrested one hooligan for using four-letter_words at a bus_stop , &quot; Kulkov offers . Great . All this crime in Moscow , and all they produce is one guy with a foul mouth ? In truth , at that very moment , a crime was at least being discussed , I later learned . Five Brooklyn cops , in Moscow on an exchange program , were in a bar talking_of a crime scene they had just witnessed . &quot; There was a dead woman lying on the street , &quot; one officer noted . &quot; Right out_in front of a crowd , the cops lifted her skirt and shoved a rectal thermometer up her . You know , to gauge how long she ' d been dead . We were shocked . Man , these Moscow cops can be cold. &quot; Eventually , the three-man patrol stops at the side of a deserted road . Three doors pop open and each man lights a cigarette . No coffee ? No doughnuts ? Shliaptsev laughs . &quot; I don ' t know what you mean , doughnut . But for coffee , there ' s no place to stop . This isn ' t like America . A restaurant takes two hours. &quot; Despite poor pay and growing crime , these officers seem content . &quot; It ' s a job for a real man , &quot; Shliaptsev says . &quot; If it ' s not us , then who will take the job ? &quot;</TEXT>
