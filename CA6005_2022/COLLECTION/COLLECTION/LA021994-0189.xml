   <HEADLINE> AGENCY FAULTS ITSELF FOR MAJOR TB OUTBREAK ; HEALTH : COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY THEY FAILED TO PROPERLY MONITOR TUBERCULAR STUDENT WHO DEVELOPED CONTAGIOUS STRAIN THAT PROBABLY INFECTED 12 CLASSMATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> County health officials acknowledged Friday that they failed to adequately follow the treatment of an Orange County high_school student with active tuberculosis who probably infected 12 classmates . They also said that from what they have learned from the recent TB outbreak at La Quinta High_School , the Orange County Health_Care Agency has initiated reforms to assure closer collaboration between the county public health office and private physicians and laboratories in the care of tubercular patients . &quot; We have instituted more aggressive systems to assure this will never happen again , &quot; said Penny Weismuller , the county ' s manager for disease control . The changes come_in response to recent critiques of the agency ' s handling of the La Quinta outbreak by the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta and the state_Department of Health Services . After the County Health_Care Agency learned in June , 1992 , that a student at Quinta High_School in Westminster had tuberculosis , a county worker made 25 unsuccessful attempts during a seven-month period to obtain information from the girl ' s physicians about the progress of her treatment , Weismuller said . Later , it was determined that the student ' s erratic practice of taking prescribedantibiotics led to her to develop a contagious , mutant form of the tuberculosis bacterium that was drug-resistant , she said . &quot; We were assuming , maybe it was a false assumption , that the patient was being treated adequately , &quot; said Dr. Hugh Stallworth , Orange County ' s public health officer . He noted that the student was being seen by both a primary care physician and pulmonary specialist who had assured county officials that she was not contagious . Federal and state investigators , whom the county invited to critique their handling of the tuberculosis outbreak , concluded that the county should have been &quot; more aggressive &quot; in its monitoring of the initial infected student , Stallworth said . The county ultimately took_over the girl ' s treatment in June when her doctors were puzzled why she had a &quot; positive &quot; sputum culture , a sign of active tuberculosis , after a year of treatment , Weismuller said . Then , in September the student was hospitalized because she was violating quarantine requirements that she stay out of public places , Weismuller said . Because of growing concern that the infected student might be spreading her disease , Weismuller said , county health workers last spring tested 225 of her La Quinta classmates , followed in the fall by a screening of the entire student body . In all , 16 cases of active TB were discovered at La Quinta , 12 of which were linked to the girl . An additional 178 students were found to be infected with the bacteria that causes TB . Stallworth believes that the outbreak was the largest one in an American high_school this century . Weismuller said the La Quinta case illustrates shortcomings of the private medical_community and the county in monitoring tubercular patients . She said a review of medical_records shows that the student believed responsible_for the TB outbreak at La Quinta was infectious since January , 1991 , when she went_to a private doctor complaining of a cough . The private physician , Weismuller said , misdiagnosed her ailment as bronchitis . The student , who wasn ' t getting_well , went_to another physician who , as early as January , 1991 , suspected that she had tuberculosis but did not report that to the county until June when he received laboratory reports that confirmed his diagnosis . &quot; He should have reported even a suspicion of tuberculosis to us , &quot; Weismuller said . Stallworth and Weismuller said they have taken steps to make certain the mistakes at La Quinta will not be repeated . &quot; We probably could have policed the private physicians more , &quot; Stallworth said . Because tuberculosis had almost disappeared in the United States , and has been increasing only since the mid-1980s , he said , many physicians need help in diagnosing and treating it . &quot; What public health is being asked to do is monitor what private physicians are doing , &quot; Stallworth said . In the wake of the problems associated with the outbreak , he said , the county has hired a public health nurse to work with doctors who report TB cases to the county . Stallworth said the physicians will be asked to show the county the kind of treatment they are prescribing and will be advised if any change should be made . Because the treatment for tuberculosis can take as long as 12 months , Weismuller said , it it especially important to keep tabs on patient compliance . &quot; It is very difficult for any patient to comply with a long-term course of therapy , &quot; she said , &quot; and the resources available in a private physician ' s office to keep track , for instance , of broken appointments with doctors , is limited . So we have to work together. &quot; In addition , Stallworth said , he has added a new position of tuberculosis program manager and an epidemiologist to oversee the search for people who have had contact with confirmed TB patients and must be tested . County officials said they also plan to hand-deliver letters to all local laboratories , asking them to report initial positive TB tests , without waiting for final results . Weismuller said the county will be assisted by changes in a state law , which became effective in January , that requires the county health agency ' s approval of the treatment plan for every TB patient . &quot; I think it came_out of increased concern for the rising number of TB cases nationwide , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
