   <HEADLINE> DAUGHTER TESTIFIES FATHER HAD HIT LIST OF VICTIMS ; COURTS : WOMAN SAYS SHE WAS AMONG TARGETS MENTIONED BY DOUGLAS STANLEY , ON_TRIAL FOR KILLING SISTER-IN-LAW , CO-WORKER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A father and daughter each shed tears in a courtroom Wednesday , he as he sat accused of killing two women and she as she testified against him . Douglas Stanley , 58 , blotted his eyes with tissue as his 23-year-old daughter , Lisa , told jurors her father told her he had compiled a list of people he wanted to kill , including her and the two women her father allegedly gunned_down in July , 1993 . Stanley faces life in prison without parole if convicted of killing his sister-in-law Joyce Stanley , 52 , and Terry Vasquez , 41 , as the three worked together in a Fountain Valley embroidery shop . Stanley admits killing the women , but contends he was suffering a form of amnesia at the time and was unaware of his actions . The stress of the testimony in Orange County Superior_Court was evident . The daughter ' s eyes were rimmed in red and her voice quavered as she recalled a confrontation during which her father ticked_off the names on the list , which included her name and those of the victims . When asked what she understood the list to mean , the young_woman answered quietly : &quot; That he wanted to end their lives. &quot; The father and daughter are estranged . The prosecution contends Stanley killed the women in part because he blamed his sister-in-law for his troubled relationship with his daughter . Joyce Stanley and her husband , Charles -- the defendant ' s brother -- sought guardianship of the daughter because the defendant moved frequently to find work . The defendant has been described as a &quot; survivalist &quot; who collected guns and often threatened to kill those who angered him . His threats were so frequent that few took him seriously . After the July 8 killings , he fled to Colorado , sparking a nationwide manhunt . He was captured July 11 after a law_enforcement officer became suspicious and began questioning him . Stanley was arrested when a gun slipped out of a pant_leg while he was talking to the officer . Deputy Public_Defender Denise Gragg said during opening statements Tuesday that her client was suffering from amnesia triggered by stress and severe heart problems when he &quot; went_off &quot; and killed the women . Gragg said her client did not premeditate the killings , a factor needed to help prove first-degree murder . But Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert Molko told jurors Stanley bragged to a friend that he planned to commit the murders and withdrew money from the bank shortly before the killings , apparently to help fund his getaway .</TEXT>
