   <TEXT> Six orange swastikas were found spray-painted Thursday outside a synagogue whose rabbi has been a vocal opponent of hate crimes and who helped draw_up a plan for fighting bigotry that was publicized this week . The vandalism of the Temple Sinai at 1212 N . Pacific Ave. , the only synagogue in Glendale , was the city ' s fourth hate crime of the year . &quot; To see the swastika is to be reminded that there are people who are filled with murderous hate , &quot; said Rabbi Carole Meyers , who is also a member of the Mayor ' s Blue_Ribbon Task_Force on Community Relations . &quot; My first reaction was of gut-wrenching horror. &quot; Authorities had no suspects in the case Thursday . Glendale police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian said the defacement of the temple may have been related to publicity over the rabbi ' s work_on the task_force .</TEXT>
