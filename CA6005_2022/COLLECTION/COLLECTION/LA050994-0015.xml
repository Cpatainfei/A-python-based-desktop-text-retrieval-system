   <HEADLINE> HISTORIC VOTE IN SOUTH_AFRICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I was 11 , I remember standing on a beach in Cape_Town , South_Africa , with my toes in the white sand , a bucket of starfish and shells in one hand , looking_out across the ice-cold caps of the Atlantic_Ocean at a place that my father , who held my other hand , pointed to . &quot; See that island out there , &quot; he said , looking_out at a vague piece_of_land on the horizon , &quot; that ' s Robben Island , where Nelson Mandela is . He ' s a black political_prisoner and will probably spend the rest of his life there . He ' s a very brave man. &quot; I thought_of Nelson Mandela as I shoveled sand into my bucket . I built a sand prison with a moat and a turret and I marked an X with a stick_in the sand in the place where he might be . I imagined him shoveling gravel , covered with sweat in the heat of the African summer , while an Afrikaans armed_guard stood_watch over him . Recently , I stood on La Cienega Boulevard with my father and other South_African expatriates , both black_and_white . I held the hand of my 5-year-old American daughter and told her that I was there to vote for a very brave man named Nelson Mandela who was far away across the Atlantic_Ocean . My vision of him was no longer vague across a misty horizon , but was clearly in front of me on the historic ballot sheet that had been handed to me inside the South_African Consulate . On it was a picture of Mandela ' s smiling face , and in the assigned space , I marked , not with a stick_in sand , but with a pen , an X for him . LINZI ALEX GLASS Los Angeles This could be entitled reflections on South_Africa : &quot; Whenever in a given community , at a crucial given point , great , heroic and superhuman actions must be accomplished in_order for more fairness and justice to be created ; then from within that community a spark is produced , which synthesizes in its personal_equation the full conscience of the entire community. &quot; The name of Nelson Mandela immediately comes_to_mind . After a very long , overdue pregnancy , a free democratic South_Africa is finally born . A bloodless_revolution , as it were . This qualification , however , would deny any credits to the ultraconservative white right-wingers and regrettably to Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi , who will be remembered in history for his open and fierce opposition to the operations and movements that turn this dream -- his dream as well as that of the Zulu tribes he rules -- into sheer reality . JEAN G . NICOLAS Fullerton South_Africa had 18 parties on its ballot . America had one party ( Republicrat ) and an irritating billionaire in the last presidential election . Gee , maybe South_Africa ' s on to something . What ' s it called ? Democracy ? MONICA REX Los Angeles Nelson Mandela became the first_person of color to be elected president in the new South_African democratic government . Much congratulations are in_order , and my hat is off to President Frederik W . de Klerk for having the courage , character and wisdom to recognize change , and allow it to take_place . We here in the United States have been a democracy for some 218 years , and have yet to come_close to electing a person_of_color to the White_House . Wake_up , America ! Change is here ; as in South_Africa , basic demographics will dictate who the future leaders of this country will be . I hope our future leaders in power recognize this trend and have the grace , courage and brains to allow it to happen . GARY R . COOK Los Angeles I was pleased to see you headlining the Opinion section ( May 1 ) with a column on South_Africa by Walter Russell Mead . The spirit of his piece is commendable . The election in South_Africa is &quot; a statement about human dignity &quot; which should be admired by all . Unfortunately , Mead ' s history of the country is flawed in several places . Churchill ' s services as &quot; a dashing British cavalry officer &quot; was in the battle_of_Omdurman in the Sudan , not during the Anglo-Boer War , in which he served as a heroic newspaper correspondent . The Zulu King Shaka did not &quot; mount one of history ' s great military_campaigns against the whites. &quot; Shaka died before it began . &quot; The last Napoleonic heir to the_French imperial throne &quot; did not die &quot; serving in a British force that was massacred by Zulu warriors , &quot; but rather during a skirmish subsequent to the battle of Isandhlwana to which Mead alludes . Perhaps most distressing to me is the fact that Mead , a foreign_policy specialist , failed to address the misguided U.S. foreign_policy which sustained the apartheid system and prolonged the suffering of Mandela and his people . Readers deserve an accurate article on South_Africa which asks us to confront the U.S. role in opposing sanctions , promoting Buthelezi , and otherwise thwarting the expression of human dignity we have just witnessed .
