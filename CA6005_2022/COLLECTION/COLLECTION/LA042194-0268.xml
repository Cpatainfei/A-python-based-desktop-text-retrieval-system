   <HEADLINE> 700 SCIENCE ENTRIES VIE FOR TOP HONORS ; EDUCATION : PROJECTS RANGING FROM COOLING THE HEAT OF CHILI_PEPPERS TO FAMILY PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES COMPETE FOR AWARDS IN VENTURA COUNTY CONTEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nicholas Guzman ' s idea for his science project began as a burning sensation . &quot; When I was eating chile peppers , &quot; the 17-year-old Fillmore High_School student said , &quot; it got too hot. &quot; After he grabbed the nearest drink he could find to cool his mouth , Nicholas began to wonder which beverages work best to provide relief to people who like their food hot . He decided to investigate . The resulting science project , titled &quot; Red Hot Chile Peppers , &quot; is one of 700 entries in the 1994 Ventura County Science Fair being held this week at the County Fairgrounds in Ventura . Students in the sixth through eighth grades from private and public_schools throughout the county entered projects in categories ranging from psychology to chemistry to math . And Wednesday , 80 local scientists , teachers and other professionals spent hours evaluating the entries and interviewing students to select the fair ' s winners , who will be announced today . In addition to looking_for originality among the science projects , judges said they also rate projects according to how well students frame the question they are trying to answer and what experimental techniques they follow . &quot; Mostly we look_for how well the scientific_method is applied , &quot; said judge Raquel Izumi , a research associate at Amgen in Thousand Oaks . For Nicholas ' project on chile peppers , he conducted taste tests on 20 family members , friends and acquaintances . After blindfolding each of his subjects , Nicholas fed them a type of hot chile pepper called chile de arbole and , after each pepper , had the subjects drink sodas , juice , milk and other liquids . The subjects told Nicholas how well each drink worked_on cooling their burning mouths . But the experiment ' s results were clear : The best beverage to drink after chomping on a hot_pepper is milk . Like Nicholas ' project , many entries at this year ' s science fair attempted to find solutions to real-life problems . And some judges said one of their main criteria was for projects to have practical value . Encouraging students to focus_on science projects with a practical_application helps prepare them for the world of work , judge Danny Clark said . &quot; When you ' re actually working , you have to have some real-life application or you ' re not going_to get paid , &quot; said Clark , an electronics engineer at the Port Hueneme Naval Surface Warfare Center . &quot; You can ' t just divide numbers for the fun of it. &quot; As an example of a project with practical value , some judges cited a psychology experiment -- titled &quot; Are Personalities Hereditary ? &quot; -- by Thousand Oaks student Rachel Garfield . A sophomore at private La Reina High_School , Rachel said she got the idea for her project after an argument with her mother . &quot; I ' d just been in a fight with my mother and I wanted to know why we couldn ' t get_along , &quot; the 15-year-old said . Assuming that she and her mother fought because they are different , Rachel tested this hunch by taking a psychological personality test she had at her home and then giving the test to her mother . To her surprise , they both had the same personality types . Then Rachel began to wonder whether personality was hereditary . So she gave the same psychological test to the parents and children in 26 families -- half of whom had adopted children . Her results showed that biological children nearly always have personalities similar to one of their parents , while adopted children only rarely have temperaments like their mothers and fathers .</TEXT>
