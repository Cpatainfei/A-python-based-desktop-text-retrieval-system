   <TEXT> Striking workers at UniHosiery Inc. have filed two class-action lawsuits against the company and its managers , alleging that male Korean supervisors practiced pervasive sex and race discrimination and sexual_harassment , and assaulted male Latino employees . The lawsuits filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior_Court are the latest charges against the company , where workers walked_out two months ago to protest what they called unfair labor practices . The sock manufacturer at 6724 S . Alameda St . also has a warehouse at 321 32nd St . and distributes wares to swap-meet vendors . According to the first complaint , UniHosiery Manager James Paik and other male company officials subjected at least 14 male workers to sexual_harassment over several years . Paik said he did not know about the lawsuits and could not comment on the allegations . The complaint alleges that managers frequently grabbed , poked and pinched workers in the buttocks and crotch with their hands or with tools . In one case , a manager driving a forklift allegedly cornered a worker against a wall . Once trapped , a second supervisor began to remove the employee ' s pants , the document states , and the managers left after the worker screamed for help . In several instances , managers allegedly followed the workers into the bathroom to ogle or assault them . When workers complained about the harassment , supervisors said they were &quot; just playing , &quot; according to the complaint . One five-year employee , who asked that his name not be used , said workers were treated &quot; like animals. &quot; &quot; Whenever my hands were busy ( on the production_line , a supervisor ) would try to touch me , &quot; said the 24-year-old Los Angeles resident . Plaintiffs are seeking $ 25 # 000 each in addition to punitive damages and attorney fees . The company also discriminated against Latino employees on the basis of race , denying them promotions and pay raises allotted to Korean employees , according to the second complaint . All positions of responsibility -- managers , office_staff and mechanics -- are held by Koreans , while all production workers are Latino , the complaint said . Latino employees who filled_in as mechanics were reportedly told that they could not be permanently promoted to the position because &quot; the company rules were that no race or nationality other_than Koreans can hold any of the higher positions at the company. &quot; Another worker said managers told him Latinos were &quot; too stupid &quot; to be mechanics , the complaint stated . The workers are seeking back pay , punitive and compensatory damages and attorney fees . About 80 workers have been_on strike since March 14 . Organizers with the International Ladies Garment_Workers Union said workers asked the union for help in February after the company passed new rules that they felt were unfair . Three weeks later , the company suspended about 50 workers , telling them their Social_Security_numbers were questionable . The garment-workers union helped organize the strike . Nearly all production employees walked_out in support . Attorney Charles Goldstein , who is representing the company , said Social_Security_numbers were reviewed after burglaries were discovered at the factory . The review revealed that many employees did not have legal_documents , Goldstein said , and these workers cannot be rehired by UniHosiery . &quot; Why would you strike a company that can ' t take them back without violating the law ? &quot; Goldstein said . &quot; And if ( the company doesn ' t ) take them back , ( the union ) can ' t declare a victory. &quot; The National Labor Relations Board is investigating charges of unfair labor practices within the company .
