   <HEADLINE> SON OF HIP-HOP ; FASHION : THE IN-YOUR-FACE STYLE ISN ' T DEAD ; IT ' S JUST EVOLVING INTO SOMETHING GENERIC AND KINDA DRAB . BAGGY STYLES AND LOUD COLORS ARE OUT . WORK CLOTHES AND GRAY , BROWN AND BLACK ARE IN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We have it on good authority that hip-hop is dead . A funeral notice appeared in the October ' 93 issue of GQ magazine ( prompted by the appearance of hip-hop fashion in Sears ) . What ' s more , Cross Colours , the Commerce-based clothing line that went from $ 15 million in sales in 1990 to $ 89 million in 1992 with colorful denim clothes inscribed with anti-gang messages , has faltered . And Merry-Go-Round stores , a shopping haven for young_men looking_for cutting-edge clothing , has filed for bankruptcy protection . But hip-hop -- both the fashion and the music -- has evolved into another , equally powerful social statement . we ' ll call it PH -- post-hip hop . Much of the music is now gangsta rap , a hybrid that makes headlines for its often brutal lyrics and headliners , namely Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur , known as much for their arrest records as for their musical recordings . The original hip-hop fashions -- bright , graphic , exaggerated jeans and T-shirts -- have faded . The preferred dress of post-hip-hoppers is generic and drab . Rarely do you see labels , logos or graphics to denote the manufacturer . The colors of the street -- concrete gray , asphalt black and sandlot brown -- prevail . Yet this notice-me-not-my-clothes style is being reinterpreted by the world ' s most scrutinized designers . The kids from Los Angeles are influencing Karl Lagerfeld , Calvin Klein and Christian Lacroix . Streetwear has often been a catalyst for high_fashion , particularly in the last several years . We ' ve seen neon-bright surfwear and bicycle gear rip through the fashion Zeitgeist . Now , a subtle urban warrior style is doing the driving . Low PH ( low-priced post hip-hop ) men ' s clothes are the stuff of blue-collar catalogues and civil-servant issue -- firefighters coats , camouflage-print pants , washed-out plaid shirts , big ol ' black jeans , heavy storm-trooper boots and the requisite knitted skullcap , called a skully . All of it is tinged with a thrift-shop pallor . When Los Angeles stylist Lynn Bugaii dresses rap_groups , she goes shopping in the Compton flea_markets . &quot; You don ' t want it to look_like you got_it at the Beverly Center , even though now you probably could get_it at the Beverly Center , &quot; she says . &quot; What people want is hard-core industrial clothes , &quot; says Los Angeles clothing designer Ron Wash , who produces custom-made tour jackets . Wash ' s firefighters jacket ( modeled on the real_thing ) has been outselling the traditional bomber styles . It has been bought by the casts of TV ' s &quot; Living Single &quot; and &quot; Martin , &quot; and by such Motown Musical_groups as El Dogg , Tha Mexakinz and Trends of Culture . * Not since Cross Colours ' rapid ascendancy two years ago has there been a label that young_men and women have worn head to toe . Urban teens want their attitude , not their clothes , to do the talking . Which is its own special kind of fashion statement . &quot; Not looking trendy is the trend , &quot; says Craig Bohman , president of Jay Jacob stores , a national chain , with 22 stores in Southern California . &quot; There isn ' t a ( popular ) label that people are after. &quot; Glitter rap star Hammer has adopted the style , trashing the harem pants , bare pecs and sundial-size medallions . The new , PH Hammer wears a skully , boots , black denim pants , tank_top and a take-me-seriously expression , although it ' s hard to see with the blinding glare from his downsized-but-still-enormous gold jewelry . Michelle Cole , a costumer for &quot; South Central , &quot; a new television_show from Fox scheduled to air in April , has been researching the post-hip-hop look among teens at Dorsey High_School . She found the &quot; baggy , baggy look is over and guys are wearing much slimmer pants -- not as skinny as Levi ' s but not hanging off their hips . They wear a lot of work clothes. &quot; The low-PH look_for women is equally anti-label . It might include , starting from the top : a skully or braided extensions , small cropped top ( the bra-top replacement ) , short skirt wrapped with a flannel shirt or denim jacket , black tights or leggings and heavy black boots or Pumas . Cole says many of the teen-age girls she ' s seen are wearing baby doll dresses , bobby socks and short shorts . Large manufacturers that are trying to reach a fashion customer have made note of the patina that accompanies a lot of the post-hip-hop styles . Diesel , one of the most forward denim companies , shows its jeans and jackets in an aged state -- as if they ' ve been worn hard and laundered only occasionally -- in ads for such trendy publications as Vibe . Dickies also roughs_up clothes before they go_in front of the camera , and it mixes Dickies bib overalls , striped coveralls , denim jackets and jeans with other labels . &quot; It ' s the way people dress , &quot; says Dickies ' representative Dee Shoup . * High PH is very much alive . It was enthusiastically embraced last season by the world-class designers and has not been abandoned . Less than two weeks ago in Paris , Lagerfeld sent a little blue bra topped with a cropped fuchsia sweater down the Chanel runway . The sweater was cut high and the waistband on the matching miniskirt was cut low so that the ubiquitous Chanel belt ( this time a thin strand of gold chain ) could thread through the model ' s navel ring . He also envisioned the lunching ladies who buy from his Chanel collection in knit shorts rolled_up the thigh , newsboy caps and brightly colored fake fur . And he showed most of these get-ups with black tights and black boots . It may seem laughable , but the demand three years ago for $ 1 # 000 Chanel biker boots created a waiting list at the Beverly Hills boutique . The Chanel flock will pay thousands for the privilege of wearing a look that began across town for less than $ 50 . Christian Lacroix ' s version of downtown for fall was a black satin evening jacket with lame short shorts , a black lace top and lace hosiery . This is not a look born in the ateliers of Europe . This is street dressing translated into the big bucks that perpetuate cycles . Even if hip-hop is dead , it ' s having a very healthy afterlife .</TEXT>
