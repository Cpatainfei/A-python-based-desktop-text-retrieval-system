   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; THROUGH THE LENS OF IRANIAN CULTURE ; TWO EXHIBITIONS AT UCLA ' S FOWLER MUSEUM ENRICH IMAGES OF THESE IMMIGRANTS IN L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In many ways modern art is the language of the misunderstood . In the beginning it was spoken by visionary bohemians and beats within this culture . Today , that language embraces and is embraced by immigrants , exiles and refugees sea-tossed to these shores by a world off its axis . UCLA ' s Fowler Museum of Cultural History addresses the issue of the modern outsider in two exhibitions that look_at the art and life of Los Angeles ' Iranian immigrants -- one a documentary photographic essay , the other works by immigrant artists . With an estimated population between 150 # 000 and 400 # 000 , it ' s the most populous enclave outside Iran proper . It has thrived here to create a subculture with its own periodicals , television and radio programming and artists of every stamp . The bulk of its membership is made_up of educated , upscale professionals who fled to escape the Ayatollah Khomeini ' s fundamentalist revolution of 1979 . Their run_for freedom curdled into absurdity . Americans , angered and humiliated by the hostage crisis at the embassy in Tehran , turned the immigrants into the villains . Photographer Ron Kelley spent five years documenting all this and more in a project that evolved into &quot; Irangeles : Iranians in Los Angeles. &quot; Now it ' s a national traveling exhibition of some 120 black-and-white photographs handsomely premiered at the museum and accompanied by a 400-page book-catalogue that amounts to an in-depth sociological study . Kelley , Jonathan Friedlander and Anita Colby acted_as project editors and curators . The show was organized by the museum in conjunction with UCLA ' s Gustave E . von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies and its International Studies and Overseas Programs department . * Kelley ' s photographic style has a populist flavor located somewhere between Robert Frank and Diane Arbus . That means it ' s a little funky and slightly inclined to exaggeration . It works well depicting a_people whose appearance leans to the vivid . Kelley captures the disorientation of trying to fit into a new culture without losing cherished values . In non-propagandistic reality , that is bound to involve elements of comedy , pathos and courage . Pictures prove there is no one monumental Iranian character or sensibility . We see bikers and belly_dancers , salesmen in silk suits and a turbaned Kurd at a picnic in the Pacific Palisades . There are women in traditional chadors and fashionable yuppies on Rodeo Drive . There is one taste for opulence and another for austerity . There are Iranian Muslims , Jews , Bahais ; Armenians , Assyrians and Zoroastrians . We see a dignified Iranian executive and his Japanese wife one second , an unruly protest against Saddam Hussein the next . There are traditional weddings and others in American style with little bride and groom figures on the cake . There are cops and hairdressers . Kelley ' s pictures have a welcome-to-the-rich-chaos-of-America touch that is tolerant and inclusive , but he doesn ' t forget tragedy . There is a recurrent feeling of enforced anonymity in pictures of people trying to have fun in the antiseptic precincts of rented hotel banquet halls and conference_rooms . There is the repulsion of an American with her &quot; Down With Iranians &quot; sign . Then comes the horror of watching a young_man named Neusha Farrahi burn himself to death in front of Westwood ' s Federal Building in 1987 . Many Americans were not quite clear just what he was protesting . If Kelley glimpses the epic , a simultaneous exhibition by four immigrant Iranian artists touches the intimate . It ' s called &quot; Labyrinth of Exile : Recent works by Ali Reza Dadgar , Payam Farrahi , Taraneh Hemami , and Shirin Neshat. &quot; Its curators are Doran Ross , Betsy Quick and David Mayo . Contemporary art styles have become so international , it ' s no surprise there is a certain familiarity about this work along with a certain exoticism . With curious aptness , two of the artists work in variations on Assemblage , once the quintessential Outsider style here . Their use of discarded wood , paper , souvenirs and photographs makes us realize there can be moments in life when the only way to hang_on to your identity is to stare at your passport picture . Ali Reza Dadgar evokes religious icons by blending graduation pictures , kid snapshots of himself , sweethearts and relatives into reliquaries of longing . Taraneh Hemami ' s art suggests the mourning historical consciousness of the German Anselm Kiefer in works that bring_together dead leaves and broken mirror . Her most affecting pieces are books that collage detritus and occasional photos . Although abstract , turning the pages of &quot; The Book of Martyrs &quot; evokes destruction while &quot; The Book of Secrets &quot; whispers of romance . All these artists bring the great tradition of Persian poetry to mind , perfumed and achingly romantic . Payam Farrahi is the most specific in slabs of porous stone bearing surreal scenes that resemble rubber_stamps or copy machine imagery along with actual verse . The most striking ensemble here is Shirin Neshat ' s &quot; Women of Allah. &quot; One of the oversize self-portrait photographs sums the whole . The head is_well over life-size , but it is shrouded in a chador and covered with verse in Arabic_script . Her large almond eyes show clearly outlined in black . Between them , nearly covering her nose , she holds an upright rifle barrel . In a fractioned second , this startling image informs Western viewers that their chances of understanding such a traditional Muslim woman are next to nil . She has been raised as a model of rectitude and told to be ashamed of her body as a sinkhole of temptation . Yet recently the leaders of her people have told her to take_up arms and fight like a man . Neshat says , &quot; I am very interested in the poetics of this contradiction. &quot; Taken together , the exhibitions are soaked in devotion and passion . * UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History , &quot; Labyrinth of Exile &quot; through Sept . 18 , &quot; Irangeles &quot; through Nov . 13 , closed Monday and Tuesday , ( 310 ) 825-4361 .</TEXT>
