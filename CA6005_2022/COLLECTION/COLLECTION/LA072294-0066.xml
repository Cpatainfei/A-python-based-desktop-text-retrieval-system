   <HEADLINE> BLAIR CHOSEN NEW LABOR_PARTY CHIEF ; BRITAIN : CHARISMATIC 41-YEAR-OLD IS PRAISED FOR HIS MODERATE POLICIES , POLITICAL SAVVY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tony Blair , the 41-year-old advocate of moderate , democratic socialist policies , was elected the new Labor_Party leader Thursday by a comfortable margin . As expected , he gained a clear majority -- 57 % of the votes cast by Labor members_of_Parliament , the constituency membership and affiliated unions . The other two candidates , John Prescott and Margaret Beckett , polled 24.1 % and 18.9 % respectively . In the race for the deputy leadership , Prescott defeated Beckett , with 56.5 % to her 43.5 % . Labor_Party supporters widely hailed the leadership team as a &quot; dream ticket , &quot; matching Blair ' s brainy charm with Prescott ' s rough-hewn common_touch . As leader , Blair would be the next prime_minister if the Labor_Party defeats the ruling Conservative_Party in a national election that must be held within 32 months . He now heads a &quot; shadow cabinet &quot; with Labor_Party members_of_Parliament designated as spokespersons for all departments of the_British government . The leadership vote was unexpectedly low , mainly among trade_unionists : Figures showed that fewer than one in four of those eligible had voted -- 952 # 109 ballots out of 4.3 million . Still , Labor_Party Chairman David Blunkett said the election was &quot; the most extensive democratic exercise ever within a European political party. &quot; Blair -- a tall , slender , articulate member_of_Parliament who was born in Scotland -- succeeds John Smith , who died of a heart_attack two months ago . Beckett had been acting leader since then . The Labor_Party has lost four national elections since last holding power in 1979 . The last defeated leader , Neil Kinnock , is widely reported as likely to become one of Britain ' s two European Union commissioners in Brussels . Blair , educated as a lawyer , is credited with a wide knowledge of politics and issues . His good looks have led some Tories to christen him &quot; Bambi. &quot; But he is , by all accounts , a tough political operator with a firm grasp on the party machinery -- and so will avoid the fractious inside battles that have split the Labor_Party in the past . In an acceptance speech , Blair declared : &quot; I shall not rest until , once again , the destinies of our people and our party are joined together again in victory at the next general_election -- Labor in its rightful place , in government again. &quot; He said of his task : &quot; It is a mission to lift the spirit of the nation , drawing its people together , to rebuild the bonds of common purpose that are at the heart of any country fit to be called one nation. &quot; To the Conservatives , he said : &quot; You have had your chance . You have had 15 years to get_it right . If you can ' t change this country for better after 15 years , you never will . It is time for you to go. &quot; Blair shrugged_off divisions between the &quot; old left and the new right , &quot; calling_for a &quot; new left-of-center agenda. &quot; But he added : &quot; We must avoid foolish illusions and false promises &quot; and said that just because the Tories had &quot; lost the nation ' s trust &quot; did not mean that Labor would &quot; inherit it automatically. &quot; Blair ' s election was praised by Labor_Party senior figures , as was Prescott ' s in the No . 2 position . Even Jeremy Hanley , the newly appointed Conservative_Party chairman picked to revive his party ' s low standing in opinion polls , congratulated Blair , mentioning they had entered Parliament together in 1983 . But he added : &quot; How is he going_to pay_for the perfect world he is advocating ? that ' s what we ' ve got_to get_out of him. &quot;</TEXT>
