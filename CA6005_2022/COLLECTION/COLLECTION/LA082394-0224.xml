   <HEADLINE> PASSIONS UNLEASHED AMONG O.C. LATINOS OVER WATERSHED VOTE ; REACTION : RULING PARTY CANDIDATE ' S VICTORY ATTRACTS ATTENTION OF ACTIVISTS AND ORDINARY FOLK ALIKE . SOME DECRY POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE , OTHERS APPLAUD BALLOTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reaction was mixed among Orange County ' s Latinos a day after the presidential election victory of Ernesto Zedillo , head of Mexico ' s ruling party . &quot; I woke_up early today expecting to see headlines reading that the Panista candidate ( Diego Fernandez de Cevallos ) would win , &quot; said construction worker Miguel Angel Luna Arrellano of San Juan Capistrano . &quot; Instead , it was just another PRI ( Institutional Revolutionary Party ) victory. &quot; Luna said he believes that Mexico immediately will face potential violence in areas such_as the Mexican state of Chiapas , the scene of a New Year ' s Day rebellion by guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army on what they said was the behalf of the Mayan masses . The uprising left 145 people dead and radically shifted a national political agenda just months before Sunday ' s election . &quot; My sentiments and my heart are for the campesinos in Chiapas , &quot; Luna said . &quot; Really , I think the real question is , how are they reacting to this ? I think that if Fernandez had won , he would have supported the working people in Mexico and you would have seen Mexicans workers from here in the United States return and work in Mexico. &quot; In Orange County and elsewhere in California , there was ample evidence Monday of the passions unleashed Sunday by Mexico ' s watershed national elections . The balloting was the most scrutinized , and possibly the most competitive , in Mexico ' s history . Zedillo of the PRI emerged victorious Monday , extending his party ' s 65-year hold_on presidential power . Amin David , president of Los Amigos de Anaheim , was encouraged by Sunday ' s election , saying he believed it was one of the &quot; fairest ever held . I was glad that finally we were going_to get a true sense of what the will of the people is. &quot; The challenge for the new leader will be how Zedillo handles Chiapas and that state ' s reaction to his victory , said Alma Buis , Fullerton police liaison to the Latino community . &quot; I was born in Mexico_City , &quot; Buis said . &quot; And I remember how PRI controls elections and the government. &quot; &quot; To understand how PRI works , &quot; Luna said , &quot; you need to live_in Mexico , like my brother , for instance . He lives with his wife in Sonora . She has been a major supporter of PRI for 15 years , and during that period she has won government contracts for work . . . . They control everything. &quot; Arturo Soto , 36 , a construction worker from San Juan Capistrano , said he had placed his hopes with Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party ' s initial presidential candidate who was shot to death during a visit to Tijuana on March 23 . &quot; I felt that Colosio would have been a good president , &quot; Soto said . &quot; He had promised to make a lot of changes and wanted to include -- and not keep_out -- people from Chiapas . The Mexican people , I feel , were ready to accept a change , and he would have been good for the country. &quot; At Josie ' s shop , a hair and nails salon in San Juan Capistrano , Guillermina Aragon , 26 , listened as a radio_announcer said that Fernandez had taken 31 % of the votes , to Zedillo ' s 47 % . &quot; See , it was close , &quot; said Aragon , who is from Cuernavaca , Mexico . &quot; My family always voted PRI , &quot; but she always voted for PAN , Fernandez ' s conservative National Action Party . &quot; It seems that PRI was always looking_out for the upper_class , and PAN supported the worker. &quot; Aragon ' s friend , Reina Delgado , 24 , said she was happy that so many people voted . After so many years of one party ' s rule , many Mexican people had accepted a &quot; so what &quot; view to voting . &quot; Many ask , why vote ? &quot; Delgado said . In recent years , Mexican political_leaders have made strong overtures to Mexican nationals residing in the United States , whose remittances back home and other expenditures in Mexico are a crucial source of foreign currency . And the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which went_into effect in January , has served to strengthen cross-border ties . Art Montez , head of Santa Ana ' s League of United Latin_American Citizens , was satisfied with Zedillo ' s victory , saying that LULAC is looking_forward to working with the president again . It turns_out that LULAC established a program using Mexico ' s Spanish books through Zedillo , then education_secretary . &quot; We tend to look_at the border areas and Mexico ' s urban_centers , like in the capital , as signs of progress , &quot; Montez said . &quot; We should go_back to measuring democracy , not by economy , but by the quality_of_life that everyone enjoys. &quot; &quot; that ' s the greatest challenge this presidency is going_to face , &quot; Montez said . Montez said Zedillo will be extended an invitation to visit Santa Ana through the Mexican consul ' s office there .</TEXT>
