   <HEADLINE> QUAKE-DAMAGED OIL_PIPELINE WILL REMAIN CLOSED INDEFINITELY ; ENVIRONMENT : RESIDENTS AND OFFICIALS APPLAUD ATLANTIC RICHFIELD ' S DECISION . THE LINE RUNS THROUGH THE VALLEY TO SOUTH BAY REFINERIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An aging oil_pipeline that sustained extensive damage in the Northridge earthquake -- including a crack that sent walls of flame through a Mission Hills neighborhood -- will remain out_of_commission indefinitely , its owners announced Tuesday . The 130-mile Four Corners Pipe Line , which connects Kern County oil fields to South Bay refineries , originally was scheduled to reopen by May 1 . But executives of Atlantic Richfield Co. , which owns the line , decided to put repairs on hold so they could further study costs and safety issues . Arco spokesman Scott Loll said the company is considering a number of options regarding the 70-year-old pipeline -- including shutting_down for good the 54-mile stretch that runs under densely populated communities between Newhall and Carson . &quot; That is a possibility we are not ruling_out , &quot; Loll said , acknowledging that Arco eventually wants to reopen the remainder of the pipeline north of Newhall . During the Jan . 17 6.8-magnitude temblor , the 10-inch diameter pipe ruptured in several places . Most notably , a spill into the Santa Clara River near Valencia killed hundreds of fish and birds and a leak near O ' Melveny Elementary School in San Fernando fueled fires along Wolfskill Street that destroyed cars and homes and seriously injured a man . Many residents and elected officials in Los Angeles and San Fernando feared similar leaks if the line was allowed to reopen without thorough testing and repairs . They applauded Tuesday ' s announcement , hoping it would allow more time to discuss alternatives with Arco executives . Leticia Quezada , president of the Los Angeles Unified School District board , said Arco ' s decision &quot; brings a lot of relief . I think it is an incredible announcement on the part of the company. &quot; San Fernando City Councilman Doude Wysbeek said : &quot; I think the company recognizes that they were wrong about the quality of the pipeline and that if they are going_to be good neighbors they are going_to have to go beyond state mandates and go the extra mile. &quot; Wysbeek added that Arco ' s action reflected an encouraging change in the way the company deals with concerns raised by the public . &quot; None of us can do business the way we used to , &quot; he said . &quot; In the old days , the golden_rule was , ' Those who have the gold make the rules. ' That has changed. &quot; Loll acknowledged , however , that part of the decision to postpone repairs was based on the amount of oil the line was pumping before the January earthquake . In other words , it may_not be profitable to reopen the line south of Newhall . The Four Corners pipe is a &quot; common_carrier , &quot; which means other oil_companies pay a fee to ship their product through it . The line had already been shut_down when the quake hit , and the oil that leaked was residue in the pipe . The state fire_marshal , who has jurisdiction over oil_pipelines , identified 20 miles of the Four Corners pipe between Newhall and Carson that needed upgrading after the quake . Loll estimated replacement_costs at about $ 1 million per mile and said Arco has already spent $ 20 million to clean_up spills caused by cracks . &quot; Given the fact that it was not operating at full capacity 24 hours a day , we are evaluating it , &quot; Loll said . Since the quake , oil has been shipped along another Four Corners pipeline that also runs_through the San Fernando Valley . Loll said the company would continue to reroute oil through that line until it determines how best to proceed .</TEXT>
