   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SHOWS CONFIDENCE IN UKRAINE ' S ARMS EFFORTS ; WEAPONS : PRESIDENT USES THE CARROT APPROACH TO PROD THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC INTO GIVING_UP ITS NUCLEAR MISSILES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton said Friday that he is &quot; personally well-satisfied &quot; with Ukraine ' s progress toward dismantling former Soviet nuclear_weapons still on its territory , despite mixed assessments by government and private analysts on how much has been done . At a news_conference with visiting Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk , Clinton expressed confidence that the Ukrainian Parliament will ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , as Kravchuk has pledged . His comments came as the Administration went_all_out to put the best face on U.S. relations with Ukraine in hopes of encouraging Kravchuk and his government to move more quickly on the nuclear_weapons issue and to make market-oriented reforms in Ukraine ' s economy . As expected , Clinton announced that the United States would more_than double its previous $ 330 million in annual aid to Ukraine to $ 700 million ; half will go_to help finance the transfer and dismantling of nuclear_weapons and half for general economic assistance . Kravchuk ' s visit was something of a victory for the Ukrainian president , who had been pressing to come_to Washington for months . He had been rebuffed until he signed an accord on dismantling the remaining Soviet missiles . He brought along figure skaters Oksana Baiul , the waif-like 16-year-old girl who won an Olympic gold medal last week , and 1992 men ' s Olympic gold medalist Viktor Petrenko . The two athletes toured the White_House and shook hands with Clinton at the meeting ' s end . As well as the increased economic aid , the White_House unveiled additional benefits , from new investment and tax treaties with Ukraine to support for the country ' s application for membership in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . The White_House said it also is reducing U.S. tariffs on a variety of Ukrainian goods under the Generalized System of Preferences , a trade program often used to benefit developing countries . U.S. officials have expressed fear that Ukraine would become a major geopolitical threat if it did not agree to return or dismantle the remaining Soviet warheads . With 1 # 600 nuclear_warheads , it is the third-largest nuclear_power , behind the United States and Russia . Under the accord , signed_in January , Ukraine has pledged to dismantle the Soviet missiles or return them to Russia for destruction . There have been conflicting reports about just how many nuclear_warheads Ukraine actually has sent_back to Russia , but analysts said that despite Clinton ' s comments Friday , the progress has been modest . Although the country is eligible for up_to $ 1.2 billion in U.S. aid to help pay_for dismantling the nuclear_weapons , it so far has qualified for only about $ 150 million ; U.S. officials , however , said they expect Ukraine to accelerate its program . Ukrainian lawmakers have already failed once to ratify the non-proliferation treaty , another major part of the accord . But Kravchuk insisted Friday that it would do so after March 27 parliamentary elections . He said that lawmakers are out campaigning . Ukraine has also done virtually nothing to move away from the kind of state-run economy that prevailed when the Communists were in power . U.S. officials said they hope that the aid Washington promised Friday will help push the country toward making some reforms . Kravchuk himself made the most of Friday ' s ceremonies , asserting that his meeting with Clinton &quot; can be without exaggeration called a historic moment in ( the ) relationship between our two states. &quot;</TEXT>
