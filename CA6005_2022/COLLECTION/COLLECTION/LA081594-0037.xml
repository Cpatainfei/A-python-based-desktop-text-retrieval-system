   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; WORLD CUP STARS SCATTERED ACROSS EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that the baseball_players have taken a walk , what are the players who run_for a living doing ? Players such_as Gheorghe Hagi and Juergen Klinsmann . Players such_as Claudio Caniggia and Marcio Santos . Players such_as Romario and -- lest we forget -- Hristo Stoitchkov . A month has passed since Italy ' s Roberto Baggio blasted the final kick of the 1994 World Cup high over the crossbar , sealing Brazil ' s victory . The new season has begun in Europe , with league play already under way in France and England and soon to begin in Germany , Spain and Italy . Those are the five major soccer-playing powers in Europe , based upon the strength of their professional leagues . It is where the majority of the big-name clubs are located and where most of the star players earn their living . In short , it is where to find those who enthralled U.S. fans in the summer of ' 94 . * England ' s failure to qualify for the World Cup appears to have had one unexpected benefit -- a new willingness to accept that foreign players might be better and therefore are worth signing . The London club Tottenham Hotspur , better known simply as Spurs , led the way by signing two of the World Cup ' s best strikers -- Klinsmann of Germany for $ 3 million from AS Monaco of France and Ilie Dumitrescu of Romania for $ 4 million from Steaua Bucharest . That puts Spurs , which is coached by 1978 World Cup winner Ossie Ardiles of Argentina , in a much better position to challenge defending champion Manchester United , which is packed with foreign talent , including France ' s Eric Cantona and Wales ' Ryan Giggs . * While Dumitrescu chose England , two of his Romanian World Cup teammates sought_out the sunshine in Spain . Hagi has joined Barcelona , while Florin Raducioiu left AC Milan in Italy to sign for Barcelona ' s cross-town rival , Espanol . Hagi ' s move , which reportedly has earned him a $ 1-million annual salary , leaves Barcelona Coach Johan Cruyff with an interesting problem . He has four of the world ' s top players under contract but can play only three foreigners in a game . Whom does he leave_out ? Romario , the Brazilian goal-scoring ace ? Unthinkable . Stoitchkov , the Bulgarian who is equally adept at finding the net ? Not likely . Hagi , the Romanian midfielder who sets_up the plays ? Not a chance . Ronald Koeman , the Dutch defender with the lethal free_kick ? How could he ? Cruyff has coached Barcelona to four consecutive Spanish league titles by being able to make such decisions , but this season could prove to be his most challenging . * European champion AC Milan had much the same problem over the past year or two because team owner Silvio Berlusconi , now Italy ' s prime_minister , insisted on buying the best players available even though it meant some would have to sit . Like their Spanish counterparts , Italian clubs can sign as_many foreign stars as they want but are allowed to play only three . This season , AC Milan has cut its foreign contingent by sending French striker Jean-Pierre Papin to Bayern Munich of Germany ; by selling Danish midfielder / forward Brian Laudrup to the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland , and shipping Raducioiu to Espanol . In return , Coach Fabio Capello has brought Dutch star Ruud Gullit back to Milan from Sampdoria . Milan still has an exceptional team , but it will be quite a task to retain both its Italian and European championships and win the world club championship in December . * South_American players make a huge impact in Europe and give the game there an unrivaled edge over the rest of the world . Every World Cup sees a new influx of talent crossing the Atlantic . The most startling acquisition made after World Cup ' 94 was by the Dutch team , PSV Eindhoven , which bought 17-year-old Ronaldo from Cruzeiro of Brazil for $ 6 million . Ronaldo was_on the Brazilian World Cup-winning team but did not play in any of its matches . He has been earmarked for success for some time , and PSV had to fight_off strong challenges from reigning Dutch champion Ajax Amsterdam and from AC Milan to acquire him . Look_for Ronaldo to be sold to an Italian or Spanish club in a_few years for considerably more_than $ 6 million . The Dutch club is known for its wise investments ; one of its former stars is Romario . * Despite the size of the Ronaldo deal , it pales in comparison to what Genoa of Italy spent to acquire Kazuyoshi Miura of Japan from Yomiuri . Genoa loaned Miura , the J-League ' s most popular and famous player , for one year for a reported $ 7.5 million . He will become the first Asian player to compete in the Italian first division . * Among South_American World Cup performers on_the_move in Europe are Caniggia , of Argentina , who was traded to Benfica of Portugal by AS Roma of Italy for a sum reportedly between $ 3.8 million and $ 4.2 million . Caniggia was banned for 13 months after testing positive for cocaine in 1993 and has not played for Roma since , although he did play for Argentina in its World Cup campaign . Elsewhere , two of Brazil ' s World Cup defenders have switched clubs . Mazinho has been loaned by Palmeiras of Brazil to Valencia of Spain at the special request of Brazilian World Cup Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira , who left that position to become Valencia ' s coach . Parreira has been busy in the transfer market and among other players he has acquired are Russia ' s Oleg Salenko , who scored a World Cup-record five goals against Cameroon , and Spanish World Cup goalkeeper Adoni Zubizarreta , from Barcelona . The other Brazilian defender to move is Marcio Santos , who was purchased by Fiorentina of Italy for $ 3.2 million from Bordeaux in France . Meanwhile , Palmeiras also has sold Colombian World Cup midfielder Freddy Rincon to Napoli in Italy . * Perhaps the most curious move made in the off-season was that of Irish striker Tony Cascarino , who left Chelsea in England to sign with Olympique Marseille in France . Because Marseille has been demoted to the_French second division in the wake of a bribery scandal , most of its stars have abandoned ship . For example , two French players , Jocelyn Angloma and Basile Boli , left to join Torino in Italy and the Glasgow Rangers in Scotland , respectively . Similarly , Yugoslavia ' s Dragan Stojkovic left to sign for Grampus Eight in Japan ; Brazilian Sonny Anderson moved to AS Monaco and Portugal ' s Rui Baros went_home to FC Porto . Cascarino will play alongside Germany ' s Rudi Voeller as Marseille attempts to win promotion back to the first division . Soccer Notes A first-half penalty kick by French star Eric Cantona and a bicycle-kick goal nine minutes before the final whistle by Paul Ince of England gave Manchester United a 2-0 victory over the Blackburn Rovers on Sunday at Wembley Stadium in London in the Charity Shield match , the traditional opener to the_English season . . . . Hungary has hired former national team defender Kalman Meszoly as its national coach . Meszoly has held the post twice before , including during the 1982 World Cup in Spain . . . . Stefan Effenberg , the German player who was sent home from the World Cup after making an obscene gesture at fans in Dallas , has been traded from Fiorentina in Italy to Germany ' s Borussia Moenchengladbach , his former club . Mexico will have to wait until January or February of 1996 to defend its title in the CONCACAF Gold Cup . The Mexicans won the second edition of the tournament in 1993 , defeating the United States , 4-0 , in the final at Azteca Stadium in Mexico_City . But Chuck Blazer , general secretary of CONCACAF , said next summer ' s international schedule is too crowded to allow the competition to be played . On tap next summer are the Copa America , or South_American Championship , in Uruguay , as well as the U.S. Cup ' 95 tournament and the Under-20 and Under-17 world championships . The German Supercup was won by Werder Bremen , which defeated Bayern Munich , 3-1 , in overtime in a match pitting the German Cup winner against the league champion . The result meant a losing debut for new Bayern Munich Coach Giovanni Trapattoni . . . . Italian World Cup goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca has been traded from Sampdoria to Inter Milan . . . . In Montreal today , Trinidad &amp; Tobago plays Jamaica and Canada plays Mexico in the CONCACAF qualifying tournament for next summer ' s FIFA Women ' s World Championship in Sweden . . . . The reelection Saturday of Alan Rothenberg as United States Soccer Federation president also saw the election of Larry Monaco as executive_vice_president and Bill Goaziou as treasurer , succeeding Hank des Bordes and Richard Groff , respectively .</TEXT>
