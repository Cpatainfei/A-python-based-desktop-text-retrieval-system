   <HEADLINE> THE PAST IS OVER -- SO IS THE EMBARGO ; CLINTON LIFTS THE 19-YEAR-OLD TRADING BAN -- AND MAYBE LONG-RANGE HOPES ABOUT VIETNAM , TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Difficult as it was for President Clinton , lifting the trade_embargo against Vietnam was the only way to go . It is indeed time to move_on , toward closure of an unpopular war whose scars remain etched on the nation ' s psyche and on individual lives . Even so , as the President made clear in his announcement Thursday , ending the 19-year trading ban does not mean normalization of relations between the two countries . For that , Hanoi must and should do more . First , Vietnam must continue to cooperate in accounting_for the more_than 2 # 200 military_personnel still missing in the Vietnam_War and in providing information on MIA-POWs . Hanoi ' s recent cooperation prompted the President ' s action . But quite rightly , Clinton said that establishing of relations depends_on Hanoi supplying &quot; more progress , more cooperation and more answers. &quot; The President is of course hardly unaware that many critics of this decision have an abiding faith that Hanoi forever will be perfidious . Consider the views expressed in today ' s Commentary page by two former national security officials of the Reagan and Bush era , both Vietnam veterans . Clinton , however , believes that lifting the trade_embargo was &quot; the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and about whom we are not sure. &quot; We share that view -- though in the end only Hanoi ' s action will determine which side is right . Second , Hanoi should pursue the genuine human_rights dialogue Clinton wants through a liaison office to be set_up in Vietnam to provide services for Americans there . The Vietnamese American community in Southern California is , at best , cautiously embracing the end of the embargo ; it remains concerned about Hanoi ' s human_rights practices and its treatment of political_prisoners . Ending the embargo is not simply an economic opportunity , though the United States was the last major industrial nation to refuse to do business with Vietnam . It should present an opportunity to further address the unanswered questions , pain and heartaches of the families of the MIA-POWs . In announcing the dramatic shift in policy toward Vietnam , the President acknowledged the unhappiness among these families and said he shared their goal of getting the fullest possible accounting of their loved ones . We all do . Clinton could have ducked this decision . It was a politically sensitive issue under any circumstances -- and it was even more sensitive for a President who did not support the Vietnam_War , a stand that became a campaign issue . But he is attempting to take the nation beyond its deep wounds to a new beginning with Vietnam . This is what a President should do .</TEXT>
