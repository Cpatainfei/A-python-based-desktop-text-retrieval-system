   <HEADLINE> U.S.-CANADIAN ' PASTA WAR ' HAS BOTH SIDES IN BOIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what was known as Defense Scheme No . 1 , Canada once planned to respond to a U.S. invasion by seizing Albany , N.Y. , and Minot , N.D. Its bizarre plan was prepared more_than 60 years ago by an equally unlikely figure : a Canadian army colonel who , wearing civilian clothes , crossed the border in his private car and scouted potential military targets . Times have changed . The United States and Canada now face each other across the world ' s longest undefended border . Yet a war of sorts is being waged even now in lush Midwestern fields of durum_wheat . The issue is pasta . Canada has elbowed its way into the U.S. macaroni market . Convinced that Canada is selling its durum_wheat -- the stuff of bow-tie noodles , angel hair , common spaghetti and just about every_other pasta -- at below-market prices in the United States , U.S. farmers are in a boil . Canadians reply that Americans talk loudly about free_trade while trying to keep the competition out . Alanna Koch , executive_director of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Assn . in Regina , Saskatchewan , said that an otherwise neighborly trading relationship will reach a flash_point if the United States tries to limit the importing of Canadian grain . In today ' s atmosphere of cutthroat international economic competition , even the best of friends can find themselves on opposite sides . If the United States and Canada can wage economic war over wheat , how much more difficult will it be for the United States and Japan to resolve their disputes ? Sunny weather on the plains coupled with adequate rain have farmers on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border talking optimistically about bountiful crops this year . But they have bumped_up against the reality of the global trend toward open borders and free_trade , brought_home first by the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free_Trade Agreement and now by the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Take the mirror_images presented by Gregory D . Downs , who raises wheat in the dark , rich soil near the Red_River of the North in North_Dakota , and Warren Jolly , who does the same near the Saskatchewan town of Mossbank , 50 miles southwest of Moose Jaw . Both are fourth-generation farmers . Downs is 42 years old ; Jolly is 43 . Each has two daughters and a son . Each has sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars into combines and tractors . Now , to save money , each is buying used equipment . Each has an academic_degree in agriculture . Downs works 2 # 700 acres , which he seeded this year with hard spring wheat for bakers , sunflowers to produce edible_seeds , white bulbous beets that put sugar on America ' s kitchen_tables -- and durum_wheat . Jolly plants durum over roughly 3 # 500 acres , an area about as large as Beverly Hills . The two men this year probably will raise about 142 # 000 bushels of durum -- enough to feed a plate of penne to every person in Beverly Hills . And each admits that if he were in the other ' s mud-clogged boots , he would have done just as the other has , taking_advantage of trading opportunities when they presented themselves and fighting them when they became a threat . But their similarities , down to a preference for aviator glasses and Western-style work shirts with mother-of-pearl buttons , do little to mask the concern and confusion that have built_up over the impact that free_trade -- or at least a cross-border trading system in which the rules have been rewritten with unpredictable results -- is having_on their lives . It is a story being told all along the 5 # 500-mile border , from the Pacific , where the two nations are arguing over salmon fishing , to the Atlantic , where the efforts of farmers in Maine to sell poultry , eggs and dairy_products in Quebec are being challenged . Canadians , meanwhile , are pushing south , trying to sell their peanut_butter , sugar and , increasingly , barley in the United States . In an angry speech that shook_up international traders , Roy MacLaren , the Canadian trade minister , warned in Washington in May of &quot; a growing list of disputes -- from pork to beer to steel -- that , if allowed to escalate , risk creating a trade and investment chill between our countries. &quot; &quot; We ' ve moved_out of a very calm period into one that has gotten testier , with a longer list of issues to deal with , &quot; said Joseph J . Jockel , director of Canadian affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . When he was in office , President Ronald Reagan established a camaraderie with then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney , a fellow conservative , and President George_Bush slipped so comfortably into the relationship that Mulroney was a frequent guest at Bush ' s oceanside home_in Kennebunkport , Me . But President Clinton and Jean Chretien , Liberal_Party prime_minister since October , have encountered each other only once . Each has focused_on domestic matters . That has left plenty of room for trade disputes . U.S. poultry sales in Quebec play into the much more difficult question of whether the province will break_away from the rest of Canada . Canadian wheat sales in the upper Midwest influence the economic recovery there , which in turn can affect congressional elections this year and the presidential election in 1996 . President Dwight D . Eisenhower was said to have once remarked , &quot; If you can ' t get_along_with Canada , who can you get_along_with ? &quot; But the history of U.S.-Canadian relations is replete with examples of contentious disputes that , while not forcing Canada to activate Defense Scheme No . 1 , nonetheless have soured the neighborly relationship . The kernel of the conflict over durum_wheat is whether Canadians engage in unfair practices in selling their crop in the United States , because the sales are based on monopoly pricing and government subsidies that cut the cost of transporting the crop to grain elevators and mills . The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to complete an investigation , requested by the White_House , on Friday . It could call_for quotas or tariffs on U.S. purchases of Canadian wheat , a decision to be made by Clinton . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the Canadians have captured as much as 40 % of the U.S. durum_wheat market by using unfair practices . The chief economist of the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture testified before the commission in April that Canadian sales had reduced U.S. farm income so_much over the last three years that the government has had to pay an additional $ 682 million in price_supports . There is little certainty about the price Canada is getting for its grain because the Canadian Wheat Board , the only legal seller of Canadian wheat in bulk , is not required to disclose such information . But while U.S. farmers may_not know the actual price Canada is getting for its wheat , they see the huge tractor-trailers hauling the golden Canadian crop to grain elevators scattered across the upper Midwest . They see the elevators filling_up with cheaper imported grain . They see a diminishing market for the U.S. crop . And it adds_up to this : lower prices being paid to farmers for wheat raised on U.S. farms . More_than that , U.S. production has dropped steadily from 3.3 million metric_tons in the 12-month period ending June 30 , 1991 , to a current level of about 2 million metric_tons . American farmers blame the increased competition from Canada , and particularly the government subsidy for transportation costs . They suspect that Canada is undercutting U.S. prices by roughly 10 cents a bushel -- a difference too small to show_up on grocery shelves but big enough to make a difference to the farmers who sell the wheat and the millers who turn it into pasta . But some agriculture economists wonder whether there really is any undercutting at all . &quot; that ' s what the North_Dakota producers allege , but it hasn ' t been borne_out by much evidence , &quot; said Demcey Johnson , an assistant_professor of agriculture economics at North_Dakota State University in Fargo . As seen in Canada , the issue is one driven by &quot; regional and local political considerations in the United States rather than by any real trade issue , &quot; a Canadian government official said . The official , speaking on condition of anonymity , dismissed talk_of transportation subsidies and complaints about the Wheat Board as &quot; red herrings. &quot; U.S. quotas on Canadian wheat sales , he said , could bring retaliation &quot; across a broad range of products in the agriculture area. &quot; For instance , Canada could impose quotas on California_wine or on the amount of finished pasta that it would accept from U.S. factories . Canadian officials and farmers also criticize U.S. subsidies to farmers who sell wheat overseas . The subsidies are mainly in retaliation for similar European export subsidies , but the Canadians argue that Canada ' s growing wheat sales in the United States are merely filling the void created when American farmers take_advantage of_their_own subsidies for wheat exports . &quot; It ' s almost like extortion , &quot; said Daniel Schwanen , a senior policy analyst at C.D. Howe Institute , a Toronto-based economic_policy research organization that generally endorses free_trade . &quot; What ( U.S. ) wheat farmers want is a higher price at the expense of everyone else . The U.S. can ' t argue that we ' re dumping wheat or we ' re subsidizing our wheat . It ' s just that we ' re selling too much. &quot; Try telling all this to Gregory Downs , mild-mannered , lanky and ready at the drop of an ever-present baseball_cap to quietly lay out his case . While the price of wheat fluctuates from month to month and last year averaged $ 4.35 a bushel in North_Dakota , the National Assn . of Wheat Growers is expecting an average price this year of $ 3.20 a bushel . By Downs ' figuring , it costs him at least $ 3.11 to raise a bushel of durum , a figure that includes such costs as seed and fertilizer , but not such indirect costs as renting his land , paying his $ 5 # 300 annual health_insurance premium and transporting his wheat 100 miles to a mill in Carrington , N.D. , where it is made into penne and rotini and other pasta . He estimates that a crop that otherwise might sell at $ 3.50 a bushel might fetch only $ 3 when the market is flooded with Canadian wheat . &quot; that ' s what will kill us -- if they drive the price below the operating expenses , &quot; he said . So over the years , Downs has cut_back consistently on the durum he has planted from a high of 1 # 200 acres to his current 450 acres . Across the border , the picture is quite different . Warren Jolly is optimistic about this year ' s crop and the cash it will bring . Prices are up . And subsidies for European farmers , which had made_it difficult for Canadians to compete , have been limited . Jolly admits to some &quot; pretty heated &quot; discussions with U.S. farmers . He is reluctant to criticize his competitors in the wheat fields across the border , although he is less restrained in his view of their government . &quot; You guys have a protectionist government down there now and they are just going_to take_advantage of it and I don ' t blame them a bit , &quot; he said . &quot; If I was down there I ' d do the same thing. &quot; As it is , Jolly , a director of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Assn. , is none too happy with the government Wheat Board , to which he must sell all his crop at a non-negotiable price . A U.S. miller offered him $ 10 for each bushel of top-quality grain , he says , but Canadian law requires him to sell his crop to the government at roughly $ 4.38 a bushel . &quot; I ' d like to see a continental market where I could deal any place in the continent , even Mexico . . , &quot; he said . &quot; That should happen . It eventually will happen , but it may be my son who ' s farming then. &quot; For Downs , the prospects looked just as good last year at this time as they do now . Then a cool July nurtured a fungus that drove down the quality and price of North_Dakota durum . &quot; It ' s frustrating being a farmer , and then you get the Canadians coming in and it ' s just another sore point , &quot; he said . That reminded him of a story about a giant fish caught off Cuba that was devoured by sharks , bite by bite , before the fisherman could bring it home . &quot; Did you ever read Hemingway ' s ' The Old_Man and the Sea ? ' &quot; Downs asked . &quot; The Canadians are just one more shark taking a bite_out of our bottom line. &quot; Gerstenzang reported from North_Dakota and Turner from Saskatchewan .</TEXT>
