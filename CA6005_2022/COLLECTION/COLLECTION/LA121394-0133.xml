   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; AN UPHILL FIGHT FOR LAW AND ORDER IN EL_SALVADOR ; YOUNG CHIEF IS BUILDING CIVILIAN POLICE_FORCE WITH SCANT RESOURCES . SOME FROM BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT HAVE TRIED TO THWART EFFORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rodrigo Avila , the head of El_Salvador ' s new civilian police_department , arrives for a meeting alone and driving his own car . No bodyguards , no assistants . This might not seem unusual except that Avila has survived three assassination attempts in his first six months on_the_job . &quot; I see it as a matter of fate , &quot; the young commander says , shrugging_off the peril . &quot; It is more dangerous today in El_Salvador to be a run-of-the-mill Salvadoran than to be the police chief. &quot; An engineer by training , a businessman by profession and a skilled sharpshooter by avocation , Avila heads the institution that is perhaps most crucial to maintaining peace in a country emerging from 12 years of civil_war . The National Civilian Police -- a nonpolitical , professional law_enforcement agency -- was created as part of U.N.-brokered accords that ended the war in 1992 . It is intended to replace the loyal police_forces that right-wing Salvadoran regimes had used for years to suppress political opposition and that were blamed for widespread atrocities . But building a police_department in a still-polarized country such_as El_Salvador , where hidden agendas can overwhelm available resources , is no easy task , and no one knows that better than the 30-year-old Avila . &quot; It is very hard to create a police_force , one that is born_out of politics , making the maximum effort that it not be politicized , &quot; Avila said in an interview at his new headquarters , a refurbished auto-repair shop warehouse . &quot; I never thought this would be easy , but I never realized it would be so difficult . . . . Forming a police_force , a project that can take years , decades , centuries , we had to do_in one year and eight months . And in a very improvised way . We had to create a police_force from zero. &quot; Today there are nearly 6 # 000 men and women wearing the new civilian police uniform and deployed throughout the country . Under the accords , the force includes former enemies -- onetime leftist guerrillas and erstwhile members of state security agencies that battled throughout El_Salvador ' s bloody civil_war of the 1980s -- as well as ordinary Salvadorans . As an institution , the police_force is still very weak . El_Salvador is suffering its worst crime_wave ever , according to Avila , and the police are not yet capable of conducting serious investigations . Much of the crime -- murders , carjackings , home robberies -- are blamed on organized_crime syndicates with strong connections to the military . Fewer than 3 % of police_officers are assigned to investigations , and even those have yet to receive training or equipment , according to U.N. officials monitoring the peace accords that ended the open fighting in 1992 . More_than 80 % of the people in El_Salvador ' s jails and prisons have yet to be tried_for their alleged crimes . Most important , the project of forming a professional police_force has met with considerable resistance , especially from intransigent elements in the government . The previous administration of President Alfredo Cristiani , which was in office until June , tried to secretly transfer units of the old , discredited police_force intact into the new police agency in violation of the peace accords . The government also allowed some officers to sidestep required human_rights training and avoid a screening process intended to weed out the most abusive agents . Avila , who likes to compare himself to Don Quixote tilting at windmills , says he has had to struggle against the ulterior motives of all sides involved in the process . &quot; We have been fighting against a lot of resistance . People in the government who didn ' t really care about the police_force . For them it was just one more part of the peace accords that had to be fulfilled . People in the army who wanted to put the brakes on the project . People from the guerrillas who thought they could take power through the police_force . &quot; These people did not recognize the importance of creating a professional police force. &quot; Avila speaks frankly about rampant corruption in the government , the judiciary , even the military . This is daring talk from anybody , but especially unusual coming from someone with Avila ' s background . The son of a military doctor who achieved the rank of colonel , Avila considers himself to be a product of the ideological right . He helped train army snipers during the war . But , he says , the war is over , and El_Salvador has to change . It can no longer be divided simplistically into the rich and poor , left and right . &quot; I am a person on the right . But I don ' t discriminate . I work with people from the left . In the ( National Civilian Police ) no one has an ideology . This is a professional job at the service of the community . There are people who call me a Communist because I work with the ( former guerrillas ) . It is absurd . I am more right-wing than the ones who accuse me , because they are only thinking_of their personal interests. &quot; Avila ' s office is spartan , with a desk , a large plant and a picture of his young daughter . He casually grasps a Grip-Master hand exerciser as he speaks , and eagerly shows a visitor a_couple_of his department ' s newest acquisitions : a hard-rubber tactical baton and a can of pepper spray . He was educated in El_Salvador and at the University of North Carolina , where he earned an engineering degree , and worked for Exxon before being named to head the operations division of the new police_force last year . He was appointed chief in June . With no police experience except for a stint as a campus security cop at North Carolina , Avila relies heavily on gumption and enthusiasm . He is likely to show_up in shirt sleeves for a meeting with judges in a country where officialdom normally clings_to formalities . And he will work the streets , showing_up at a demonstration to negotiate with disgruntled bus_drivers , for instance . At some point , human_rights and U.N. officials say , Avila is likely to get his wings clipped if his efforts to build_up the powers of the police challenge the political equation too directly . President Armando Calderon Sol recently ordered the army into the streets of San Miguel , El_Salvador ' s second-largest city , to end a transport strike , declaring that Avila ' s Civilian Police agency was not capable of handling it . And already , some of the evils that plagued the old police , such_as bribe-taking and other corrupt practices , are beginning to creep into the new agency , knowledgeable observers say . &quot; The most I can hope to do is lay the foundation , set_out some rules , so that no one , not even a new police_chief , can simply do whatever he wants but must follow a new , institutional policy , &quot; Avila says . &quot; That will be the legacy. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Biography Name : Rodrigo Avila Title : Director , National Civilian Police Age : 30 Personal : Married to Jeanine .
