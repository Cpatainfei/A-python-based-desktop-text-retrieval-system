   <TEXT> Adolf Hitler saved us the trouble by taking his own life , and so did Goebbels and Himmler , but the victorious Allies still faced a tough question when Nazi Germany surrendered in 1945 : What to do with the other high-ranking Nazis -- Hermann Goering , Albert Speer , Rudolf Hess and a dozen or so others -- now held_in Allied custody ? Put them up against a wall and shoot them , advised Winston Churchill . Cooler and more calculating heads prevailed , as Joseph Persico shows us in &quot; Nuremberg , &quot; and the Allies resolved to put the worst offenders among the leadership of the Third_Reich on_trial in the former Nazi shrine-city of Nuremberg . Now historian and biographer Joseph Persico captures both the sweep and the detail of the war_crimes trial in an account that sometimes reads like a Ludlum novel . The Allies were concerned -- indeed , almost obsessed -- with making a credible case against the Nazis before punishing them . To prevent the Nuremberg trial from become &quot; a victor ' s spectacle &quot; and &quot; a high-grade lynching , &quot; as Persico puts it , the Allies afforded the defendants a trial with all_the trappings of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . But the larger purpose of the Nuremberg trial , as Persico points_out , was moral and historical . Nuremberg was the place for fixing the crimes of the Third_Reich in the collective memory of humankind , an opportunity to translate the German bureaucratic euphemisms -- &quot; Special Action &quot; and &quot; Final Solution &quot; -- into flesh and blood . &quot; Germany became one vast torture_chamber , &quot; declared Robert Jackson , a sitting Supreme Court justice who took the job of chief prosecutor at President Harry S . Truman ' s request . &quot; The cries of its victims were heard round the world and brought shudders to civilized people. &quot; To his credit , Persico manages to compress the vast legal and political machinations of the Nuremberg trial -- a Gargantuan and unprecedented judicial exercise that produced a 42-volume transcript -- into less than 500 tight pages without sacrificing the colorful details or the subtle nuances . &quot; Nuremberg &quot; evokes the quirks and foibles of the Nazis who conquered and ruled Europe with unspeakable cruelty . Goering , for example , is revealed to be a dangerously charming sociopath , a bloodstained voluptuary who showered expensive baubles on his jailers and insisted on sleeping_in his favorite blue silk pajamas in an otherwise Spartan cell . Tellingly , when Goering ' s young daughter was allowed to visit him shortly before the verdict , she asked : &quot; Daddy , when you come_home , will you wear all your medals in the bathtub like everybody says you do ? ' Persico invests a good_deal of time and effort in describing the little scandals and the petty turf wars that raged within the legal bureaucracy of the International Military Tribunal . Persico suggests , for example , that prosecutor Jackson took_advantage of the no-wives-allowed rule to conduct an affair with his secretary . And he gives us a play-by-play account of two American prison psychologists who ruthlessly competed with each other to come_out with the first book about the Nuremberg defendants . Persico also concerns himself with the fine points of the judgment at Nuremberg . Was it proper to hang Julius Streicher , he ponders , whose principal crime was the publication of a newspaper filled with anti-Semitic pornography ? And why did the judges impose the death_penalty on Fritz Sauckel , a Nazi functionary with a blue-collar background who conscripted slave laborers by the millions , and not on Speer , the cultivated technocrat who worked the slave laborers to death in his arms factories ? &quot; In sending Sauckel to die and allowing Speer to live , &quot; Persico observes , &quot; the court , consciously or unconsciously , made a class judgment. &quot; Persico weighs the equities of the Nuremberg trial , and -- although he is not entirely pleased with the legal procedures or the specific verdicts -- he declares his approval of its work : &quot; Nuremberg may have been flawed law , &quot; he concludes , &quot; but it was satisfying justice. &quot; Lest we forget the crimes of Nazi Germany -- and lest we entertain any doubts about the ample evidence of those crimes -- Persico ' s &quot; Nuremberg &quot; shows us that the defendants never even attempted to dispute that torture , enslavement and murder were conducted on a grotesque scale in concentration_camps and killing pits all_over Europe . They merely competed with each other to shift the responsibility for their crimes to each other or to Nazis who were conveniently dead . And that is the single most important function of the Nuremberg war_crimes trial and , for that matter , Persico ' s book : It ' s a pointed reminder that the crimes against humanity committed by the Third_Reich were rigorously and repeatedly proven by hard evidence during the trial itself .</TEXT>
