   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RAOUL WALLENBERG ; HONOR THIS HERO BY GETTING TO THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS FATE ; WORLD_WAR_II : THE LEAST THAT AMERICA CAN DO FOR ITS &quot; HONORARY CITIZEN &quot; IS TO PURSUE HIS CASE WITH THE KREMLIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was_on July 9 , 1944 , that Raoul Wallenberg , the 32-year-old Swedish aristocrat , arrived in Budapest on his extraordinary mission to help rescue a desperate Hungarian Jewry . Few knew then and remarkably few know today that his employer was an unusual government_agency -- the U.S. War Refugee Board . The board was created by President Franklin D . Roosevelt in January , 1944 , shortly after he learned from Secretary_of_the_Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr . that the State_Department had been engaged in a conspiracy to subvert rescue efforts . The most stunning achievement of the board was its hiring of the courageous Wallenberg to operate out of the neutral Swedish legation in Hungary . He saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust , a significant part of the estimated 200 # 000 rescued by the War Refugee Board . Wallenberg was kidnaped by Moscow ' s intelligence services in January , 1945 , and disappeared into the Soviet gulag . The U.S._government , at its highest level , has done precious little to ascertain his fate . Only at the beginning of Wallenberg ' s apprehension did Washington seek to vigorously intervene , although quite indirectly . In the face of the massive and changing Kremlin deception and cover-up of the Wallenberg case , continuing until the present , top Washington officials have been silent . It is time to end that silence . Moscow ' s policy of dealing with the Swedish hero falls_into four stages . Stage 1 coincided with Wallenberg ' s kidnaping . The Swedish Embassy in Moscow was officially informed by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Dekanosov that &quot; Russian military authorities have taken measures to protect Raoul Wallenberg and his belongings. &quot; In fact , he had already been incarcerated in the notorious Lubyanka prison and held as a prisoner_of_war . It was only at this stage that indirect high-level Washington intervention occurred . On April 9 , 1945 , Secretary_of_State Edward Stettinius cabled the U.S. ambassador in Moscow , asking him to extend &quot; all possible support &quot; to the Swedes in their diplomatic efforts on behalf of Wallenberg . The Stettinius cable was prompted by a message to the State_Department from the U.S. minister in Stockholm that intervention was appropriate as &quot; we had a special_interest in Wallenberg ' s mission to Hungary. &quot; At about this time , Secretary Morgenthau advised the War Refugee Board ' s executive_director : &quot; Let Stettinius know that I am personally interested in this man. &quot; Afterward , high-level inquiries ceased . Stage 2 was formally initiated on Aug . 18 , 1947 , when , in response to foreign , mainly Swedish , inquiries , the new Soviet deputy foreign_minister , Andrei Vyshinsky , declared that &quot; Wallenberg is not in the Soviet_Union and is unknown to us. &quot; Stage 3 was launched in 1957 , in response to overwhelming evidence from released gulag prisoners who had seen Wallenberg . That April , Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko acknowledged that Wallenberg had been in the Lubyanka prison but had died of a heart_attack on July 17 , 1947 . The evidence was a report presumably written by the chief prison medical_officer , Dr. A.L. Smoltsov to Minister of State Security Viktor Abakumov . Smoltsov went_on to say that the corpse had been cremated . It was assumed that the documentation would prove convincing . Gromyko said no &quot; other information whatsoever &quot; was found . Since Smoltsov died in 1953 and Abakumov was executed in 1954 , the case , conveniently , was said to be wrapped_up . Even then , however , sharp challenges could be posed . How could the 35-year-old Wallenberg , known to have been in excellent health throughout his stay in Budapest , suddenly succumb to a heart_attack ? Casting even greater doubt on the Smoltsov report was a 1992 investigation by a Swedish-Soviet commission that revealed that the only crematorium in Moscow , in its list of cremations for 1947 , carries no mention of Wallenberg . Stage 4 of the cover-up began with a Tass dispatch of April 24 , 1991 , about a meeting between high Soviet security and foreign-office representatives with Wallenberg ' s half-brother , Guy von Dardel . Von Dardel was told that Wallenberg ' s death in 1947 was &quot; an irrefutable fact &quot; and &quot; there is no reason to continue to investigate his fate. &quot; Why not ? The answer was sharp and pointed : &quot; All the available materials &quot; have been opened and &quot; there is nothing more. &quot; Significantly , nothing at all was mentioned about the Smoltsov document , so discredited had it become . That security officials are continuing to perpetuate a lie was disclosed by the top archival official in Moscow , Rudolf Pikhoya . In late 1991 , he bitterly complained in a major Soviet publication that the KGB had deliberately classified certain documents on Wallenberg as &quot; operational intelligence &quot; and thereby closed them to public scrutiny . Indeed , very recent disclosures by former spymaster Pavel Sudoplatov identify the specific files where information on Wallenberg is located . While Moscow was engaged in its vast deception , Congress was stirred to action by Rep . Tom Lantos ( D-San Mateo ) , a survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary . It enacted a statute in the fall of 1981 granting Wallenberg the almost unique status of &quot; honorary citizen. &quot; Only Winston Churchill had been accorded that honor . At the level of diplomacy , however , intervention was modest and only in forums of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe . Ambassador Max Kampelman vigorously raised the issue at Madrid in 1980 , as did Ambassador Warren Zimmermann at Vienna in 1988 . We still don ' t know what happened to Wallenberg nor why he was kidnaped . Russian President Boris Yeltsin , in his 1992 address to the U.S. Congress , promised that the Kremlin would engage in &quot; no more lies. &quot; It is time to put him to the test at the highest level of government . that ' s the very least we can do for the unusual employee of the U.S. War Refugee Board who became America ' s &quot; honorary citizen. &quot;</TEXT>
