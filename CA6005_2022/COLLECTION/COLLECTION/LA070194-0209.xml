   <HEADLINE> HAITI MILITARY HURT BY SANCTIONS , OFFICIALS SAY ; CARIBBEAN : CHRISTOPHER CLAIMS RULERS FEEL PRESSURE AS ECONOMIC CURBS GAIN ' TRACTION. ' HE SAYS INVASION MAY NOT BE NEEDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senior Clinton_Administration officials said Thursday that they are seeing encouraging signs that economic sanctions are putting so_much strain on Haiti ' s military regime that a U.S. invasion may_not be needed to restore the elected president to power there . &quot; We ' re now getting some traction &quot; from sanctions , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . &quot; I think they will ultimately be out because of the pressure we ' ve brought , &quot; he said , referring to Haiti ' s military rulers . Asked whether the Administration favored an invasion to overthrow the regime and reinstall exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Christopher said : &quot; No . . . the option we ' re pursuing now is to try to increase the pressure through the use of sanctions. &quot; He said many of the sanctions were &quot; relatively recent , &quot; and he argued that they should be given time to work before military options are considered . Christopher ' s comments echoed a statement a day earlier by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , who has publicly expressed opposition to an invasion . Another senior official said U.S. intelligence_analysts have detected increasing signs of strains in Haiti ' s ruling elite , including apparent conflict between Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the military chief_of_staff , and other leaders of the regime . &quot; There ' s a lot going_on in Port-au-Prince that we can ' t talk_about in detail , &quot; one official said . &quot; Each individual is feeling pressure. &quot; The officials spoke after White_House meetings on Monday held to review the Administration ' s sanctions policy , as well as its efforts to provide facilities for thousands of refugees who have sailed from Haiti during the last week . Early Wednesday , police reportedly fired on a 60-foot boat carrying would-be refugees off the southern coast village of Nan L ' Etat , causing a panic in which 30 to 40 refugees drowned . The report came Thursday from two Western journalists , who quoted witnesses . The Coast Guard said it picked_up at least 700 more refugees from the waters off Haiti on Thursday , bringing the total number rescued over the last six days to more_than 4 # 000 . Only one day after President Clinton announced the reopening of a tent city for refugees at the U.S. Navy_base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , 1 # 123 Haitians were being housed there , officials said . The flood of refugees appeared to increase pressure on the Administration for a solution to the Haitian impasse . But officials insisted that , at least for now , Clinton is not being pushed toward a decision to invade . Several Republican senators warned Christopher that they will fiercely oppose any military intervention in Haiti . &quot; I don ' t believe that there is any vital national interest or strategic reason for the United States to risk even one life of one American service person to restore Aristide to power , &quot; Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) said . &quot; If we do invade , and that first body_bag comes_out , that ' s when all hell is going_to break loose. &quot; Christopher disagreed . &quot; Our interests in Haiti are very strong ones , &quot; he said . &quot; It is in our own back yard . Stability in the Caribbean and in the region really is dependent upon not having elected leaders overthrown by an illegitimate group of thugs. &quot; On Wednesday evening , the Senate rejected , 65 to 34 , a Republican-sponsored measure that would have required Clinton to obtain formal authorization from Congress before taking any military_action in Haiti . In Jamaica , U.S. officials working around the clock processing Haitian refugees on a Navy hospital_ship anchored in Kingston harbor began shuttling the overflow to Guantanamo Bay . Of the more_than 4 # 000 Haitians picked_up , 978 have been interviewed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service . Officials said 301 of them have been found to have &quot; a well-founded fear of persecution , &quot; which is the official standard for winning refugee status , and are awaiting transport to the United States , Canada or other countries . With a capacity of 12 # 500 , the Guantanamo naval base is seen as an easily readied emergency camp to be used only until a more permanent asylum center is opened in the Turks and Caicos Islands . But at the current rate of exodus , refugees threaten to quickly fill both the Guantanamo camp and the Turks and Caicos station , which has a planned capacity of 2 # 000 . It will open by July 15 , officials said . * Special correspondent Mike Clary in Kingston , Jamaica , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
