   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S PREMIER BOWS TO SOCIALISTS AND SCRAPS TAX_HIKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa today bowed to Socialist demands to temporarily scrap a tax_hike intended to pay_for a $ 49-billion income_tax cut_to boost the sluggish economy . The move averted a collapse of Hosokawa ' s 6-month-old coalition government . Hosokawa will now be able to meet President Clinton on Friday with a substantial tax cut proposal and an overall $ 140-billion economic stimulus package in_hand . Washington had urged both measures to stimulate Japanese consumer spending and shave Japan ' s politically nettlesome trade surplus , estimated at about $ 55 billion last year . However , it was not clear whether the measures will satisfy Washington , as unconfirmed reports indicated today that the tax cut may last only one year . U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen earlier had said that a temporary tax cut would be unsatisfactory . Still , it was the quickly encroaching U.S.-Japan summit that forced parties here to break their political deadlock and end the turmoil that had paralyzed this nation since Hosokawa made his surprise tax proposal last Thursday . At that time , the prime_minister abruptly announced at a 1 a.m. news_conference that the tax cut would be financed by a new 7 % &quot; people ' s welfare &quot; levy on goods and services . Outraged Socialists , the coalition ' s largest group , promptly threatened to quit the government , and the ensuing public outcry sent the popular Hosokawa ' s approval ratings plummeting . &quot; The U.S.-Japan summit can be characterized as the savior of the Hosokawa administration , &quot; said Minoru Morita , a political analyst . Under the plan , the typical family will get a tax cut of about $ 1 # 300 , but whether Japanese consumers will spend it or save it amid the nation ' s grimmest recession in two decades is unclear . &quot; Even though a certain portion of this tax cut will certainly be saved , I think it will have a beneficial effect on consumer demand , &quot; said Kunio Miyamoto , chief economist at Sumitomo Life Research Institute . He added that despite the political infighting , Hosokawa should be given credit for making difficult policy decisions -- from opening the rice market to political reform to the tax issue . The Tokyo stock_exchange responded well to the tax agreement . In midafternoon trading , the Nikkei index was up by 306 points , or 1.5 % , to 20 # 320 . &quot; I think this tips the balance to a recovery , &quot; said Geoffrey Barker , an analyst with Baring Securities Ltd . Barker predicted an economic_growth rate of 2 % in the fiscal_year beginning April 1 . The decision marked an extremely rare triumph of politics in Japan , a nation controlled by unelected bureaucrats . In accepting Socialist demands to scrap the tax_hike for at least a year , Hosokawa and his coalition partners defied mandarins of the Ministry of Finance -- commonly regarded_as Japan ' s strongest political power . Finance bureaucrats had adamantly opposed cutting taxes without securing a way to pay_for the cut at_the_same_time . The government also wants to reduce its dependence on income_taxes in favor of consumption taxes to cushion its national treasury when the number of retirees begins to mount . Japan ' s society is aging faster than any other in the world . A majority of Japanese in several recent polls seemed willing to accept a tax_hike to pay_for a tax cut and the aging society . But they hotly objected to the imperious way the program was suddenly pushed_on them with virtually no debate or explanation .</TEXT>
