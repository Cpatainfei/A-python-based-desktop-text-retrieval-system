   <HEADLINE> MARKET SCENE ; GERMAN BOOKWORMS BOW TO NEW MEDIA ; CD-ROMS AND OTHER COMPUTER_TECHNOLOGY CLAIM A MAJOR ROLE AT FRANKFURT ' S ANNUAL BOOK FAIR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first time Erik Schylander showed_up at the Frankfurt Book Fair to peddle CD-ROM-equipped computers for the Dutch company Philips Electronics , in 1986 , the world publishing Establishment treated him like , well , a hardware salesman at a book fair . &quot; They said to go_away , &quot; said Schylander , Philips ' general_manager of strategy and standards . &quot; And I said , ' I ' ll come_back in 10 years to see if I can get a corner. ' &quot; It didn ' t take 10 years , and Philips grabbed more_than a corner this year at the 46th annual Frankfurt fair , where electronic media claimed about 97 # 000 square_feet in a hall of_their_own . But while no one showed Schylander the door , the response from book_lovers was still something less than a kiss . &quot; The people walking_around and looking are friendly , &quot; Schylander volunteered in explanation of his reception . &quot; Um , the rest is a question of understanding . It ' s a cultural problem among publishers , to understand and use the new media. &quot; Microsoft , one of the largest U.S. producers of CD-ROM titles , set_up a mini-theater , a bank of computer terminals and a coffee_bar to friendly up the crowd . The center_of_attention was CD-ROM -- Compact_Disc / Read Only Memory -- the technology that puts information and games at your fingertip , or your mouse ' s paw tip . &quot; You ' re talking_about people venturing out into a new frontier of publishing , &quot; said Microsoft marketing manager Mitchell Wolfson . &quot; A lot feel nervous , apprehensive . They feel they are being forced . And they are not sure what their next step is. &quot; The computer guys hastened to assure their colleagues in traditional publishing that CD-ROM , CD-I and the other elements of 21st-Century multimedia are complements to books , not competitors . They are television to radio , CNN to newspapers . Different markets , the computer_experts asserted . * You could see pain on the faces of those who speak_of a &quot; special feeling &quot; for books . Cozy_up in bed with a CD-ROM ? Thumb through a first edition of Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia ? Feel a freshly minted disk ? These were people who still spell byte with an i . &quot; I love the old way of printing and making books , &quot; said Claus-Peter von Nottbeck , a Cologne publisher who has put_out 25 books on the natural and political_sciences . &quot; You are losing a lot of old traditions. &quot; German entrepreneurs generally are not known to leap to the forefront of new technologies . In electronic publishing , they ' re about five years behind their American counterparts , said Torsten Brunn of Boersenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels , Germany ' s central organization of booksellers . But the publishers and booksellers roaming the aisles of the high-tech hall were also practical sorts . They use mobile telephones and pocket_calculators , work_on computers and recognize that people around the world are spending less time each day with books . By the end of the year , Germans will own an estimated 1.5 million computers with CD-ROM capability -- 2.5 million by the end of 1995 . Even Von Nottbeck sees himself going electronic in the next two years . &quot; I feel I have to , &quot; he said . The electronic media made their debut at the 1993 Frankfurt fair , and the number of firms exhibiting earlier this month had more_than doubled since then , to about 230 . Though still only a fraction of the fair ' s 8 # 600 exhibitors , they made a splash in the German press . &quot; The new media is there . We cannot talk it away , &quot; said fair director Peter Weidhaas . But the printed book , he insisted , &quot; will not lose its importance. &quot; * Though fair officials gave the electronic folks their own place this year , the plan , according to Microsoft ' s Wolfson , is to integrate them back into the main halls . &quot; As we move_into the mainstream in the next three or four years , we ' ll be alongside the books , &quot; he said . In fact , they already acted pretty mainstream , serving wine and cheese over electronic_dictionaries . The aisles of the electronic media hall were packed with booksellers and bookworms and salespeople hawking electronic encyclopedias , medical texts and on-screen maps . &quot; The main question asked by publishers is , does the CD-ROM replace books ? We don ' t think so . But the market share of CD-ROMs will grow , &quot; said . Annette Damerow of Bertelsmann Electronic Publishing . Gertraud Griepke , electronic media manager of the German science and medical book publisher Springer , said just 1.7 % of her company ' s production is electronic . She expects that to jump to 10 % in the next five years . Griepke said consumers don ' t have to understand how their electronic media work , just how to operate them . &quot; I don ' t know what my phone is doing when it rings or what my car is doing when I switch_on the engine . I just know it goes grr-r-r-r and I can drive it , &quot; she said . Griepke and other electronic publishers said traditional publishers are nervous about electronic media because of a shortage of good developers in Germany and because the software is easy to duplicate , robbing them of potential customers . But she said authors and consumers want full multimedia capability , such_as beating hearts in medical books . &quot; Our authors are forcing us to go_into this , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
