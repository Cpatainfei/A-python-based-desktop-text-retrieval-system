   <HEADLINE> ' THE OWL ' DOESN ' T BLINK WHEN HE CALLS MEXICO A ' NARCO-DEMOCRACY ' ; CORRUPTION : FORMER ANTI-DRUG OFFICIAL EDUARDO VALLE ESPINOSA ' S ALLEGATIONS HAVE ROCKED THE GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The solitary corruption fighter who has rocked the government here and riveted the nation with his denunciations of &quot; narco-politics &quot; is not a tenacious prosecutor , a crusading politician or a tough cop . They call him &quot; the Owl. &quot; He is a bespectacled , fiercely outspoken journalist named Eduardo Valle Espinosa . He is a former ' 60s-era student activist , left-wing congressman and top aide to Mexico ' s attorney_general . The Owl ' s persistence has made him a controversial overnight sensation at a turbulent time : The assassination Wednesday of a prominent leader of Mexico ' s ruling party -- a crime being attributed to drug_traffickers , political infighting or both -- gives new urgency to Valle ' s warning that drug-related violence is menacing the nation ' s stability . In May , Valle made headlines when he resigned as the head of an elite anti-drug unit and declared that corrosive corruption had turned Mexico into a &quot; narco-democracy. &quot; But that was just a prelude . With public attention focused last month on Mexico ' s historic presidential elections , Valle sat_down with Mexican investigators in Washington and gave seven hours of explosive testimony . He provided detailed documents -- investigative memos , wiretap transcripts . He named names , including a Cabinet-level official he linked to drug lords . And he discussed his theory that politically connected cartel forces took_part in the March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party presidential candidate . The extraordinary allegations from a well-placed source have bolstered similar charges by critics of the government and triggered hasty denials from the Cabinet_minister and an ambassador , playing into one of the most basic and universal concerns in Mexico today : The fear of the &quot; Colombian-ization &quot; of Mexican society . A recent survey by Mexico_City ' s prominent daily Reforma found that 80 % of Mexicans believe that drug trafficking is the most serious threat facing the country . Valle asserted in a recent interview with The Times that the drug cartels have become &quot; a state within the state. &quot; &quot; The difference is that in Colombia , the drug_traffickers have negotiated directly with the state , as if they were another state , &quot; Valle said . &quot; In Mexico , it has not reached this point . It is hidden ; it has not reached the Colombian level in form . But in terms of the power of the cartels , it has. &quot; For all_the resulting media attention , Valle ' s former employers in the attorney_general ' s office have seemed distinctly unimpressed . Six days after his first disclosures , the nation ' s chief prosecutor issued an aggressive blanket denial of his charges . But privately , sources in Mexico ' s ruling party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , appear to be taking Valle more seriously . Political analysts say President-elect Ernesto Zedillo , who campaigned on pledges of sweeping law_enforcement reform , may well use the Owl ' s investigation to make an example of officials in the current government . Although none would be quoted by name , Zedillo ' s aides indicated that he has followed Valle ' s disclosures closely and that he plans to make the fight against the cartels a top priority after he takes_office Dec . 1 . The present government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also may well act preemptively , using Valle ' s charges to ferret_out at least a handful of corrupt officials in what political analysts in the capital say is the traditional , end-of-term housecleaning in the six-year Mexican presidency known as the sexenio . It remains to be seen whether any crackdown would go beyond the symbolic purges by past administrations and whether this week ' s murder of Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the secretary_general of the PRI and a close ally of both Salinas and Zedillo , will provide further impetus for reform . But the most persistent speculation regarding &quot; narco-politics &quot; has centered_on Emilio Gamboa Patron , the 44-year-old minister of communications and transport . Valle paints him as a point_man for the cartels . Traffickers use the minister ' s vast fiefdom of airports and highways to move drugs with impunity , according to Valle . Gamboa , who has staunchly defended himself against the charges in a news_conference , is a former rival of Zedillo ' s for the ruling party presidential nomination . But Valle ' s charges go_far beyond a single government ministry , embracing the biggest criminal case in the land -- the March assassination that changed the course of Mexican politics . Regarding the role of &quot; narco-politics &quot; in the Colosio case , Valle has offered several leads to the special prosecutor investigating the assassination . But he admits that he has little concrete proof for his suspicions . So far , investigators have not found evidence against three Colosio campaign officials about whom Valle raised questions , according to sources close to the probe . &quot; As far as the Colosio case is concerned , Valle did not present new proof , &quot; an official said . Valle speaks well of the special prosecutor but expresses disgust with officials in the attorney_general ' s office , who have questioned his credibility in stinging tones . In a brief statement dismissing Valle ' s allegations , Mexico ' s attorney_general , Humberto Benitez , declared flatly that the former investigator &quot; provided no proof that would implicate the public_servants he mentions in drug trafficking. &quot; In response , Valle accused the nation ' s top prosecutor of failing to follow_up_on the evidence he had provided during his Washington testimony . &quot; With surprising speed , they examine dozens of case files and reach the conclusion that there is insufficient proof , &quot; Valle said in a telephone_interview from Washington , where he now works as a foreign correspondent . &quot; This is an arbitrary act without any foundation in law . It is a real embarrassment . I have lost all confidence in this institution. &quot; The voluble whistle-blower said he has not received any overtures from the Zedillo camp and remains dubious about the reformist talk . He plans to continue the long-distance onslaught that has captured the imagination of the Mexican public and of the nation ' s increasingly independent , hard-charging press . Besides his testimony , he has fired off letters to Salinas and unburdened himself in long interviews with reporters , at turns emotional , caustic and jovial . &quot; Forget about my safety . Who cares ? &quot; he said when asked about the risks . &quot; Some people may say I am crazy . At least they say this guy is brave , he ' s not corrupt. &quot; Valle , 47 , was recruited in February , 1993 , by former Atty . Gen . Jorge Carpizo MacGregor . Carpizo , who has a reputation for integrity , became Mexico ' s interior minister early this year and most recently was in_charge of the Aug . 21 federal elections that most observers concluded were the cleanest in Mexican history . Valle makes an unlikely crime fighter . His political activity as part of the &quot; 1968 generation &quot; of student militants cost him stints in prison and run-ins with federal security_forces who waged a violent campaign against the Mexican left . He was elected in 1985 to a three-year term as a federal deputy representing the Mexican Workers Party in Congress , where he met Colosio , then a fellow legislator . Despite his anti-Establishment background , Valle readily accepted Carpizo ' s invitation to work as a close aide . &quot; The fight against drug trafficking is a fight for democracy , for our nation ' s children and for the young people , &quot; Valle said . &quot; Perhaps some of my friends on the left do not understand that. &quot; With a team of handpicked young agents , Valle led a secretive and harrowing investigation targeting kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego of the Gulf_of_Mexico cartel . It is considered the nation ' s most powerful narcotics organization , shipping cocaine north in partnership with the Cali cartel of Colombia . Valle said he encountered pervasive interference by corrupt state and federal_officials . And he said he discovered an alarming link between the cartel and top officials in the transportation and communications ministry . The alleged go-between was Marcela Rosaura Bodenstedt Perlick , 31 , a former federal police agent who is reputedly connected to the Abrego cartel , according to testimony and documents presented by Valle . Journalists have dubbed her the &quot; Mata Hari &quot; of the scandal . Based on intelligence reports and wiretap records presented to investigators , Valle asserts that Bodenstedt used her friendship with the transportation minister ' s chief_of_staff to make contact with Gamboa himself . The government has admitted that Gamboa met with the woman last November , but officials say the only purpose of the meeting was to discuss a painting she wanted to sell . Mexican officials have said Bodenstedt is under investigation and apparently has left the country ; they said she has not been charged . Scoffing at their statement that Gamboa did not know the woman ' s alleged connections , Valle points_out that the minister oversees the federal highway police , a force with significant drug-fighting responsibility . Bodenstedt and traffickers had contact with a presidential aide and other high-ranking government officials , according to Valle . He also provided documents listing airstrips that are suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking . And he testified that federal intelligence reports show links between officials , including Mexico ' s current ambassador to Britain , and those suspicious airstrips . The ambassador vehemently denied the accusations in a letter published in mid-September . Valle ' s evidence includes voluminous records of high-tech eavesdropping throughout Mexico by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration . The Mexican press has published some of the material , complete with names and phone_numbers of suspects , companies suspected of money_laundering and surveillance logs . &quot; The protection isn ' t just proved by the meeting with Marcela , &quot; Valle told The Times . &quot; It is the pilots and owners of airplanes with arrest_warrants that have not been served . It is the runways that have not been investigated . These are structural problems. &quot; The standard line from the Salinas administration is that drug corruption , although serious , has not penetrated the government to a meaningful degree . But some political opposition leaders and other analysts agree with Valle that the threat is far greater . In recent interviews , Baja California Gov . Ernesto Ruffo Appel cited his experiences in the border state , which this year was the scene of the Colosio assassination , the slaying of Tijuana ' s police_chief and a shootout between state and federal police -- cases linked to both drugs and politics . Valle presents an accurate picture , said Ruffo , a member of the opposition National Action Party , or PAN . &quot; I have seen cases where police_officers were reluctant to act for fear of being betrayed , &quot; Ruffo said . &quot; This is very delicate . This is threatening the stability of the republic , not only the federation , but the government of the republic . This is very serious . It must be one of the most important tasks of the government . . . . What the Owl says has a lot of truth to it. &quot; Opposition leaders also suggest that the Colosio case could be connected to an attempted power grab by an alliance of drug_traffickers and hard-line leaders of the PRI . Valle believes that corrupt forces tried to infiltrate the presidential campaign and Colosio resisted them . &quot; I cared a great_deal for Colosio , &quot; Valle said . &quot; It cannot be permitted that they announce that a lone assassin killed him and then they leave it at that . I believe Colosio was killed because he did not ( negotiate ) with the drug_traffickers or the ' narco-politicians. ' &quot; Valle testified that in the months before the March assassination , he learned that officials in the Colosio campaign had invited a brother of Abrego , the Gulf cartel kingpin , to a dinner for the candidate . He says he warned a close Colosio aide , and the invitation was rescinded . Valle also expressed suspicion about two Colosio security chiefs , former federal police_officers with alleged criminal pasts , and about Raul Zorrilla , campaign coordinator of special events and a former transportation sub-secretary under Gamboa . Valle told investigators in Washington that Zorrilla had &quot; immense responsibility &quot; in the protection of traffickers while working for the Transportation Ministry , according to a transcript of his testimony . Valle testified that he warned the candidate through intermediaries about Zorrilla , who he said was to be dismissed in a shake-up of the campaign staff then headed by Zedillo . Valle said that he had scheduled a meeting with Colosio to offer his assistance in campaign security March 25 -- two days after the assassination . The special prosecutor ' s office noted Valle ' s allegations about Zorrilla ' s role in the campaign in a Sept . 6 news release , saying all pertinent leads would be followed . But there has not been independent confirmation of the corruption allegations . While authorities have questioned the two security chiefs named by Valle , they have yet to question Zorrilla or look_into the reported invitation to the kingpin ' s brother , an official said . Investigators so far have not found evidence contradicting the thesis that the accused assassin , Mario Aburto Martinez , acted alone , according to officials . While the Owl awaits the outcome of his war of words , he has returned to the journalism trade far from home . He clings_to his independence , insisting he is not protected by the U.S. Justice_Department . In fact , he says American law_enforcement officials have not aggressively pursued Colombian and Mexican drug lords for fear that revelations of government corruption could destabilize Mexico . In an impassioned open_letter to Salinas in August , Valle said he moved to Washington not because of fear but because of &quot; priorities . The truth is more important than my life . About the Colosio assassination and about the domination by the Cali cartel of the Mexicans -- 85 million of us. &quot; Rotella reported from San Diego .
