   <HEADLINE> U.S. DEALT SETBACK IN EFFORTS TO SEEK OVERALL PEACE ACCORD IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration is attempting to move beyond the cease-fire in Sarajevo to negotiate a peace agreement for all_of Bosnia-Herzegovina , but its initial efforts have failed to produce the quick results some officials hoped for , aides said last week . The State_Department ' s special envoy , Charles E . Redman , went_to Sarajevo last week to ask the Muslim-led Bosnian government to provide its &quot; bottom_line &quot; terms for a final settlement , but the divided Bosnians said they were not ready to make a proposal , officials said . Instead , the Muslims have reopened some issues that the Administration thought were already solved -- and suggested that they may demand more territory than the 33.3 % of Bosnia-Herzegovina they agreed to last year , officials said . Some Bosnian military commanders have even argued that the government should take_advantage of Western threats of force against their adversaries , the Bosnian Serbs , and mount a new offensive on the ground . These complications have dealt a setback to the Administration ' s hopes that the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo could produce new momentum toward an overall settlement of the 22-month-long Bosnian war . And they have raised the paradoxical prospect that the United States , after setting_out to help the Bosnian Muslims defend their interests , may begin to think_of them as too stubborn in their demands . &quot; I don ' t have any sense that they are_on the verge of announcing a draft settlement , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said . &quot; The peace process is moving , but it ' s not going_to happen instantly , &quot; a senior State_Department official said . &quot; The Bosnians are divided over what to do. &quot; Another senior official , asked how long the Administration ' s peace initiative will need before it shows results , said : &quot; We ' re talking_about months. &quot; Bosnia ' s ambassador to the United Nations , Muhamed Sacirbey , said he was certain his government would opt_for a negotiated peace over continuing the war . &quot; We are committed to the peace track , &quot; he said . But he added that it would take time to settle_on the &quot; bottom line. &quot; Sacirbey confirmed that the Bosnian Muslims may ask_for more_than the 33.3 % of Bosnia that they accepted in negotiations last year . &quot; The limit of 33.3 % is an open issue because so many other questions are open , &quot; he said . A U.S. official said : &quot; that ' s in the middle of the negotiations that are going_on right now. &quot; The Muslim-led Bosnian government now holds less than 20 % of the country ' s territory , and giving them even 33.3 % would require that the Bosnian Serbs turn_over large areas that they have taken by force . In part because of the Bosnians ' delay in coming_up with a peace proposal , the Administration may take a more active role in offering suggestions for the shape of a settlement , one official said . That is a sensitive point for President Clinton and Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , for they have repeatedly pledged that the United States would not pressure the Bosnian Muslims , as victims of aggression , to accept any particular outcome . In fact , however , senior State_Department officials have already settled privately on what they see as a realistic outcome to the war -- an outcome many Bosnians would view_as unacceptable . The State_Department officials said the elements of a realistic settlement appear to include : * A three-way partition of Bosnia according to the formula worked_out in U.N.-sponsored talks last year , giving 49 % to the Serbs , 33.3 % to the Muslims and 17.5 % to the Croats . * An exchange of territory under which the Muslims would give_up three besieged towns in eastern Bosnia -- Srebrenica , Zepa and Gorazde -- in exchange for land around Sarajevo . The Bosnian government has rejected this , demanding that the three enclaves be linked to Sarajevo with protected roads across Serbian territory . * A loose confederation that would leave open the possibility that Bosnia ' s Serbian and Croatian areas would unify with Serbia and Croatia -- another outcome the government has rejected . In part to nudge all three factions toward a settlement , senior U.S. , European and Russian officials may meet in Europe this week &quot; to focus_on what a likely package looks_like , &quot; a senior State_Department official said . In addition , Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic plans to come_to Washington in hopes of determining how much the Bosnians can ask_for and still enjoy U.S. support . Administration officials insist that they will not pressure the Muslims to accept anything . However , they acknowledge that they have let the Bosnians know -- gently -- that the United States will not support them forever if they refuse a settlement that is reasonable in American eyes . The picture is further complicated by the suddenly renewed enthusiasm of Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin for a major role in the negotiations . Russian nationalists have complained that the West was victimizing the Serbs , who like most Russians are Eastern Orthodox Christians ; and Yeltsin has responded by promising to protect the Serbs ' interests . &quot; The sense of Yeltsin ' s letter ( to Clinton last week ) was : ' You ' ve got your dog in this fight and we ' ve got ours -- but where during the Cold_War that would have put us on opposite sides , this time we ' re in cahoots , trying to get everybody to agree to a settlement , ' &quot; a senior official said . &quot; The only problem is that the Serbs don ' t need a good_deal . The Serbs already have a good_deal . . . . So there ' s a bit of a dysfunction there , &quot; he said . If negotiations do progress , the Administration will face another problem that officials don ' t like to talk_about : Carrying_out a peace agreement will require money and troops . Clinton has promised to provide as_many as 15 # 000 U.S. peacekeeping troops if a settlement is reached -- but his eagerness to send them may fade rapidly as the November congressional elections approach .</TEXT>
