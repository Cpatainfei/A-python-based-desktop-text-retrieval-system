   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRATIC GRIDLOCK BODES ILL FOR NOVEMBER ELECTIONS ; POLITICS : INTERNAL DIVISIONS ARE BLOCKING KEY BILLS . THE PARTY ' S MIDTERM PROSPECTS MAY BE HURT AS A RESULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Liberal Rep . Ronald V . Dellums ( D-Oakland ) is likely to support the House Democratic leadership ' s health_care plan but hasn ' t decided to back the massive crime bill now stalled on the brink of final passage . Moderate Rep . Dave McCurdy ( D-Okla. ) supports the crime bill but opposes the leadership ' s health_care measure . At the moment , House Democratic leaders don ' t count enough votes to pass either the health_care legislation Dellums wants or the crime bill McCurdy supports . That , in a nutshell , is the Democrats ' dilemma as they approach a midterm election some party leaders fear could deteriorate into a rout . On not only health_care and crime , but also welfare and campaign finance reform , shifting coalitions of disaffected Democrats in both houses are blocking Congress from completing action on issues that could bolster the standing of President Clinton and the party in November . On each of these issues , individual Democrats are trying to avoid positions that could prove controversial at_home or are defending interests they consider critical to their political survival . But party strategists are increasingly concerned that the cumulative effect of these decisions is to reinforce disenchantment with Congress and weaken the party ' s midterm prospects as_a_whole . To students of game_theory , it is a classic dilemma : By seeking to fortify their positions as individuals , Democrats may be cutting the ground from beneath themselves as a group . &quot; Right now , the image that ' s being conveyed to the American people is that we can ' t get the job done , &quot; said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman . &quot; Unfortunately , that fits_in with the American public ' s preconception of Congress -- and that will hurt incumbents. &quot; To Republicans , already expecting a rich harvest of new congressional seats in November , the self-imposed Democratic gridlock is a windblown bounty . &quot; It ' s so nuts , you cannot believe it will continue all_the way through October , &quot; said Republican pollster Bill McInturff . &quot; If it does -- wow ! Then they will face monumental losses. &quot; Democratic congressional leaders are cautiously optimistic that nervous rank-and-file legislators will ultimately accept the power of that logic . This week , they ' re hoping to complete final action on the long-delayed crime bill in the House , begin floor debate on health_care reform in the Senate , and perhaps make a breakthrough on campaign finance legislation long immobilized in a House-Senate conference committee . &quot; Today it looks really screwy , &quot; acknowledged Tom O ' Donnell , chief_of_staff for House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) . &quot; But we ' ve got more time , and I think we will get a lot of this stuff done. &quot; Given the intensity of public concern about crime , Democrats are likely to obtain final approval this month for the long-delayed $ 33-billion crime bill -- though even that would put the bill on Clinton ' s desk almost half a year later than the White_House once hoped . But on health_care , campaign finance , and welfare reform , the prospects and timetable are murkier . The long , enervating struggles over these issues raise questions about the capacity of Democrats , who control both chambers of Congress , to surmount not only Republican opposition but their own differences in the interest of assembling a stronger record for November . &quot; It ' s a very serious problem , &quot; said Democratic pollster Alan Secrest , who works with many party centrists . &quot; Politics is said to be the art of compromise . But there are some pretty serious stakes here if this Congress can ' t come_to a consensus and bring_to a close some of these issues. &quot; Almost every imaginable permutation of internal division has confounded Democratic efforts to finish action on these four high-visibility initiatives . On health_care , the principal problem is the party ' s right_wing . In both houses , resistance from moderate and conservative Democrats to a requirement that employers help pay_for their workers ' health_insurance poses a huge threat to Clinton ' s signature promise : guaranteed health coverage for all Americans . On welfare reform , the principal problem is the party ' s left wing . Angry resistance from House liberals to Clinton ' s plan during recent House Ways and Means Committee hearings has virtually obliterated the always-slim prospects that Congress would deal with the issue this year , congressional leaders say . Further delay is likely , even though many Democrats are eager to run_on the issue this fall . And probable Republican gains in November could leave liberals facing an even more inhospitable legislative climate on welfare reform next year . On crime , the problem comes from both wings . Last week , House leaders were forced to postpone final consideration of the President ' s crime bill because an incongruous alliance of liberal and conservative Democrats refused to support a key procedural vote needed to bring the measure to the floor . On the left , liberals led by the Congressional Black Caucus are angry that House-Senate conferees dropped the so-called racial justice provision that would allow defendants to challenge death sentences as racially discriminatory . On the right , conservative Democrats , under pressure from the National Rifle Assn. , are fighting a last-ditch attempt to remove from the legislation a ban on 19 types of assault-style weapons . As they recessed for the weekend , House leaders were optimistic they could assemble the needed votes , but were still 15 to 20 short . On campaign finance , the problem is institutional , not ideological . House Democrats depend heavily on campaign contributions from political_action_committees , so they are resisting Senate efforts to cut the amount PACs can give to candidates . Senate Democrats depend heavily on large donations from individuals , so they are resisting House proposals to cap the share of funds a candidate can raise from that source . Both sides are &quot; scared that any change in the current law , in the system that they have mastered , will disadvantage them , &quot; said Ellen Miller , executive_director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington . The chaos reflects both short-range and long-term trends . It testifies to the reluctance of many Democrats to embrace ideas associated with Clinton . It also illustrates the declining ability of congressional and party leaders to herd legislators behind a common agenda . Said one House Democratic aide trying to round_up votes on the crime bill : &quot; No one . . . will exact any punishment ( for opposing the party ) . There are no sticks left . There are some carrots , but there is no punishment. &quot; But on each of these issues , the biggest problem Democrats face could be another dilemma addressed by game theorists : While the risks of inaction are potentially formidable , they are less immediate and concentrated than the risks of action . For instance , political operatives say , individual legislators know precisely what to expect if they cross the NRA by backing the assault-weapon ban , or anger the National Federation of Independent Business by supporting mandatory employer financing of health_care benefits . &quot; What goes_on in the back of a member ' s mind is the 30-second ad that says : ' They want to take_away your choice of a doctor , ' ' They want to take_away your gun , ' &quot; said an aide to a moderate Democrat who hasn ' t decided to back either the health_care or crime bills . It is more difficult to quantify the political threat to individual Democrats if Congress cannot achieve significant progress on crime or health_care . But , as Mellman noted , if deadlock further intensifies public disenchantment with Clinton and Congress , that undoubtedly will sweep_away some more Democratic incumbents in November -- though it is impossible to predict which ones . &quot; That is a much less visible threat , &quot; Mellman said . &quot; Nobody is looking down a barrel of gun , saying : ' It ' s pointed at my head if we don ' t get something done. ' But there will be people who wake_up this November shocked that they lost , who thought it could never happen to them , but who could not overcome the climate. &quot;</TEXT>
