   <HEADLINE> JURY STUDY TO LOOK_AT RACIAL BIASES , TRIAL RESULTS ; JUSTICE : CAL STATE FULLERTON RESEARCHERS WILL EXAMINE PANELISTS ' EXPERIENCES AND THEIR POSSIBLE PRECONCEPTIONS ABOUT DEFENDANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Do criminal juries regard Asian defendants differently than white defendants , black defendants differently than Latinos ? Three Cal State Fullerton social_scientists intend to find_out . The three will conduct a groundbreaking study to determine whether racial preconceptions affect parts of the judicial_system . &quot; This is a pioneering attempt to gain an empirical look_at whether racial or ethnic bias impinges on the jury-trial process , &quot; said Gregory Robinson , associate director of the university ' s Social_Science Research_Center . Robinson , psychology professor Ronald E . Riggio and criminal justice assistant_professor George M . Dery III have contracted with the Judicial Council of California for about $ 73 # 500 to examine jurors ' experiences and trial outcomes , university officials said Wednesday . &quot; With all these high-profile trials going_on now , it ' s likely that people will be interested in the results , &quot; Riggio said . The Judicial Council , which oversees the state ' s courts , is expected to release the study findings this spring . The researchers said they are arranging to access computerized records of tens of thousands of cases involving charges of murder , robbery and other felonies . They plan to examine jury decisions in felony cases in Orange and Alameda counties , as well as misdemeanor cases in Los Angeles County that involve driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs . Riggio said prior studies did not ask jurors specifically about racial or ethnic bias , and no existing studies use as much data as the researchers plan to examine . The researchers ' first_step : going_through case dispositions as far back as 1990 . That can mean as_many as 40 # 000 cases in each county per year , Robinson said . They will examine verdicts involving defendants of different races , ethnicities and gender , which can be difficult to compare at first , researchers said . But by using statistical methods , they will eliminate some of the factors beside racial or ethnic bias that could account_for disparities in juries ' verdicts . Robinson said those factors include whether defendants use interpreters , whether they have private lawyers or public_defenders , their ability to post bail and previous convictions . The researchers also will look_for trends in cases in which defendants plead guilty without going_to a jury trial . In addition to analyzing convictions , acquittals and mistrials , the scientists will talk to jurors . They plan to survey 750 former jurors in Orange and Alameda counties by telephone to ask whether they think race and ethnic prejudices played a role in the jury ' s decisions . Afterward , they hope to conduct personal interviews with members of six to eight juries who deliberated recent cases . Riggio said the three researchers work well together because he has prior experience in interviewing jurors , Robinson is an expert in analyzing data and research methods and Dery is a former prosecutor for the Los Angeles district_attorney ' s office . &quot; We feel pretty fortunate we fell_in together , &quot; Riggio said . &quot; We ' re a perfect team. &quot;</TEXT>
