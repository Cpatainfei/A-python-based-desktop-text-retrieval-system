   <TEXT> The stuff of George_Bush ' s life -- an old infielder ' s mitt , the door of a Kuwaiti palace , even a huge likeness of Bush ' s head from a Republican convention -- is being sorted in an old bowling_alley . Of course , there ' s not enough room in the old Chimney Hill Bowl for 36 million pages of documents , a_million photos and 40 # 000 objects . So some of it is crammed next door , in what used to be the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant . Someday , this will be the treasure of the George_Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A &amp; M University . But for now , it ' s just pile upon pile of Bush fodder for the archivists . &quot; Our job is to preserve , arrange and review and ultimately try to make as much available as we can to the American people , ' said David Alsobrook , acting director of the Bush Presidential Materials Project . The actual library and museum -- an $ 83-million project -- is about 90 % complete on an engineer ' s drawing board . Groundbreaking is planned for November with dedication in 1997 . That means Alsobrook and his staff of 10 researchers from the National Archives have three years to catalogue and organize items that filled four C-5A cargo planes in the days just before Bush vacated the White_House in 1993 . The material isn ' t confined to Bush ' s presidency . Other items come from his eight years as vice_president , his tenure as a Texas congressman , as CIA director and other government stops that accounted_for dozens of moves his family made around the globe . They even include scarred furniture that made many of the moves and date_back to home_movies of Bush as a child . The museum also has the left-handed first_baseman ' s glove Bush used at Yale . &quot; BUSH , &quot; prominent in capital block_letters , was carved into the leather decades ago . Material from all_over the world continues to arrive as foreign governments and ordinary citizens deliver gifts and Bush memorabilia . &quot; This is not a static collection . It ' s forever growing , &quot; said Patricia Burchfield , the museum curator . &quot; Every day is like Christmas around here . There ' s some really spectacular things. &quot; A gold model of a Saudi palace . Gold swords and jewelry from grateful Saudis and Kuwaitis for Bush ' s role in the Gulf War . A saddle from Mexico . At least two golf_bags and sets of clubs . A porcelain candelabra from Germany . A section of the Berlin Wall . One Oklahoman who served in Desert Storm sent a piece of marble column he said came from Saddam Hussein ' s summer palace in northern Iraq . An emir from Kuwait sent Bush a door from his palace , trimmed with gold and engraved with the names of American soldiers killed during the Persian_Gulf_War . &quot; What you ' re looking_at here is very recent American history , &quot; said Alsobrook , who spent 10 years at the Carter Presidential Library in Georgia before drawing the Bush assignment . Uniformed guards patrol the premises . There are closed-circuit_television monitors and sophisticated electronic detectors along walls and doors . Some printed material is classified and will remain so for years ; it is open only to those with top-secret clearances . There are also rows of shelves holding campaign signs , banners and buttons . &quot; We ' ve got every piece of important campaign memorabilia that deals with George_Bush , &quot; said Burchfield , who spent 20 years at the Lyndon Johnson Library in Austin . A warehouse-like room where bowlers once racked_up strikes now has 58 lanes of stacked shelves filled with boxes of printed documents . &quot; You just take little bites , &quot; Alsobrook said . While Alsobrook and his staff try to organize the collection , Don Wilson is charged with finding a way to pay_for the three-building complex on a 90-acre site at the west_end of campus , across from the goat and sheep center . The museum and library will be the centerpiece of the Center for Presidential Studies , the Center for Public Leadership Studies , the Center for International Studies , the George_Bush School of Government and Public_Service and several Texas A &amp; M academic_departments . The university has committed $ 41 million . Wilson , executive_director of the Bush Presidential Library Foundation and former director of the Gerald Ford Library , has raised about half of the $ 42 million he needs . He expects to complete the fund raising in a year . &quot; We ' re in good_shape , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not a tough sell. &quot; Bush has insisted it be a working place for historians and students . &quot; He ' s a little bit self-conscious and really doesn ' t want this to be a monument , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; But he ' s pretty comfortable with it and very interested because he wants to spend a lot of time here. &quot; Computerization of written documents is making the job of sorting documents somewhat easier . Historians eventually will be able to use key_words or phrases to find what Bush said about a particular subject and when he said it . For example , historians will note that in 6 # 786 speeches or public statements , Bush mentioned his least favorite vegetable -- broccoli -- 54 times .</TEXT>
