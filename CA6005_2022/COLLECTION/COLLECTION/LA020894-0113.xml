   <HEADLINE> FEWER GUNS WOULD MEAN LESS CRIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In a Jan . 4 letter ( &quot; Banning Guns Gives Thugs the Advantage &quot; ) , William O . Felsman showed that his gift for rhetoric exceeds his knowledge . Felsman cannot see the logic of calling_for tighter restrictions on guns after the shooting of a high_school student . &quot; What ' s the connection ? &quot; he asked . I will explain the connection in simple terms . If we were to impose stricter controls on guns , they would be less available and fewer problems would arise . Many people argue that criminals obtain their guns illegally , but they ignore the fact that many -- perhaps most -- of those guns were once legally owned , then were stolen . That is how criminals obtain guns . Felsman suggests that banning guns would benefit only criminals . If this is the case , why do countries with outright bans or near bans on handguns have significantly lower crime_rates ? Critics of gun_control like to point to the high murder rate in Washington as an example of the failure of gun_control . In reality , a study published in the Dec . 5 , 1991 , New England Journal of Medicine reported that the crime declined after strict gun_control was enacted in the nation ' s capital . Nine years after the 1976 law was passed , gun-related homicides and suicides both declined by about one-fourth ( use of other weapons for suicide or homicide showed no significant change ) , while the same figures remained relatively unchanged in surrounding areas . Also , the study indicated that homicide and suicide rates dropped immediately upon enactment of strict gun_control . Even if one can ignore the decreases in crime associated with decreased gun ownership , private gun ownership causes other problems . Can Felsman deny that accidental deaths by handguns would decline if handguns were not easily available ? And what about the &quot; crimes of passion &quot; where someone gets shot in a domestic dispute ? Most shooting victims are shot by someone they know , not the roving &quot; bands of thugs &quot; to which Felsman refers . The bottom_line is this : Tighter restrictions on handguns , even to_the_point of outright bans , reduce deaths . We should ban ownership of firearms except for use in a well-organized militia , as specified by the 2nd Amendment . DAVID HOLLAND Granada Hills</TEXT>
