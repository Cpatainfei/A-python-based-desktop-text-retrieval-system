   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA FAMILIES FIGHT TO REUNITE ; BALKANS : WAR LEAVES MULTITUDE OF CHILDREN WITHOUT PARENTS . MANY ARE AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES NOW LIVING IN CROATIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Spring , 1992 . War engulfs tranquil Bosnia-Herzegovina . Tens of thousands of parents , desperate to save their children , send them off on buses , trucks , even on foot . Two years and 200 # 000 dead or missing later , many of those children have no idea where their parents are , and parents search for their children in vain . Most of the children left alone are Muslims , who suffered most when Bosnian Serbs launched the war in response to Muslim and Croat declarations_of_independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia . As the fighting ebbs , international aid workers are trying to help reunite divided families . Sometimes the search crisscrosses the globe . At home , it is hampered by disrupted road , rail , telephone and mail links between Bosnia and Croatia , where up_to 300 # 000 Muslims and Croats from Bosnia have taken refuge . Some lost children are in Serbia , but most Serbs who fled Bosnia did so in a more organized fashion . Three agencies are trying to reunite families -- the International Committee of the Red_Cross , the office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , and Unaccompanied Children in Exile , a Croatian group . No one knows just how big the problem is . The Red_Cross lists 1 # 200 children as &quot; unaccompanied , &quot; or separated from both parents and without a guardian . The U.N. agency and the Croatian organization so far have registered 1 # 100 children under 18 without at least one parent , including 110 who have had no contact for about two years . U.N. officials fear the total number of unaccompanied children could be as high as 40 # 000 . Even many children who are safe with other relatives no longer have clear memories of their parents . They tend to grow_up quickly , burying the emotional loss under a tough surface . When Nejra Sprzo was 15 , a year older than her brother , Mustafa , their mother put them and five cousins on a bus leaving Sarajevo for Zagreb , where their grandmother lived . Her mother promised Nejra they would all be back in a week and she would get a new dress . That was 27 months ago . In April , when telephone_lines to Sarajevo were finally restored , Nejra talked to her mother again for the first time . &quot; Mummy , I ' m not your little_girl any more , &quot; she said . &quot; Don ' t worry about us . We learned how to take_care of ourselves. &quot; Mirsada Omercevic , now 12 , and her sister , 14-year-old Suada , last saw their mother in April , 1992 , when they were sent by bus from Ribnica in northern Bosnia to an uncle in Zagreb . &quot; For two years , we did not know what happened to Mum or Dad , &quot; Mirsada said . &quot; We only heard that our house was burned down. &quot; When their mother finally called_on a mobile phone a_few weeks ago , &quot; I almost didn ' t recognize her voice , &quot; Mirsada said . &quot; She only had time to tell us they moved to another village and are all alive. &quot; Many other parents cannot call because they don ' t know where their children are . Sanela Huskic , 40 , asked Unaccompanied Children in Exile to help find her son , Almir . He was 14 in August , 1992 , when Serb guards took him and his father separately from the prison_camp in eastern Bosnia where the family was held . &quot; Since then , I never heard from him , &quot; Huskic said by telephone from a refugee camp in Denmark , where she and her daughter , Alisa , now 14 , landed after a long journey through Croatia . She keeps Almir ' s photograph deep in a drawer because &quot; if I looked_at it , I couldn ' t stop the tears. &quot; Vesna Bosnjak , head of the Croatian agency , said it is trying to help at least 40 parents with missing children . Some were working abroad when the war began and had left their children at_home in Bosnia , she said . Others &quot; were in such a panic that they just gave their child to someone leaving a war zone , to a group or person , without asking anything , without papers . And now they do not know where their child is. &quot; &quot; When the war began , people were scared and the only thing they thought_of was to try and guarantee safety for their child , &quot; she said . Alexandra Zivkovic , another official of the agency , said it may take months , even years , to track_down the missing parents and children . &quot; A lot of people are still fighting for their lives in Bosnia , &quot; she said . &quot; When the war stops , we ' ll maybe have more cases. &quot; The U.N. refugee agency has announced plans to establish a computer_network across former Yugoslavia as part of its Operation Reunite . Bosnjak ' s organization has relied_on word_of_mouth , ham radio and newspaper_ads to connect parents and children . Red_Cross offices use their unique message system : Anyone can send a message from any of the 112 nations where Red_Cross or Red Crescent societies operate . Red_Cross convoys carry the messages even to remote areas of Bosnia . Elizabeth Twinch of the Red_Cross said 7 million such messages had crossed the battle_lines in former Yugoslavia .</TEXT>
