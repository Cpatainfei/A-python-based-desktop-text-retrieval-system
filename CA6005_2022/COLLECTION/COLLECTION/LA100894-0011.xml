   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; MOVING VOTERS , NOT MOUNTAINS ; HOW MUCH IMPACT DOES A GOVERNOR HAVE ON CRIME , IMMIGRATION AND THE ECONOMY ? NOT MUCH . OVER TIME , THOUGH , A CHIEF_EXECUTIVE ' S INFLUENCE CAN BE PROFOUND ON THE STATE ' S PSYCHE AND POLICIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pity the poor governor . Leader of a nation-state of 32 million people , commander of a small army , boss to a quarter of a_million civil_servants , California ' s chief_executive seems to hold awesome powers . But on the issues that people care the most about right now -- crime , immigration , the economy and education -- a governor ' s impact is only marginal . Some of those problems are simply beyond the reach of a governor ' s authority . In other cases , legislators , lobbyists and courts stand_in the way . And even when a governor does get something done , it might be years before the public sees the result . You would never know it though from listening to the campaign now under way for the job . Here , the candidates trawl for votes as if governors move mountains . Democrat Kathleen Brown accuses Republican Pete Wilson of sleeping at the switch while the state lost hundreds of thousands of jobs , while thugs murdered innocent victims , and while school test scores floundered . She promises to make everything right again . Wilson takes credit if a factory adds a job or two , or when local crime_rates dip . And he boasts of cutting government spending -- something that never would have happened had a depressed economy not reduced tax receipts . These claims and counterclaims tossed about in the heat of the campaign often have little connection to what a governor can or cannot do . &quot; A governor ' s authority , while probably more awesome than any other single Californian in terms of making a difference in people ' s lives , is still relatively limited , &quot; said Steven Merksamer , who was former Gov . George Deukmejian ' s chief_of_staff . &quot; It ' s not nearly as great as people generally like to think. &quot; California ' s governors , in some respects , are not unlike the managers of baseball_teams : They can influence the game by naming the lineup and calling the signals , but the outcome almost always depends_on factors outside their control . Considering these limitations , does_it matter who is elected governor ? The answer undoubtedly is yes , but not for the reasons that the candidates often would have us believe . Over time , a governor ' s impact can be profound . From Hiram Johnson to Earl Warren to Ronald Reagan , many of California ' s leaders have left indelible marks on the state ' s psyche and policies . As the most visible of all_the state ' s officeholders , governors can rally the public to a cause , whether it be wresting power from a monopolistic corporation , building world-class universities and colleges , or undertaking a historic expansion of the state_prison system . In normal times , a governor ' s primary powers are to propose a budget , sign and veto legislation and organize the executive_branch , which while it employs about 250 # 000 souls , has fewer than 1 # 000 who depend_upon the governor ' s good graces for their jobs . Governors also appoint the state ' s judges and the members of important regulatory boards that do everything from setting utility rates to directing smog-fighting programs and controlling development along the coast . The governor has the power to grant clemency , which means that the occupant of the office can decide whether to spare a life or execute a condemned felon . And during an emergency , a governor can suspend state laws and regulations , commandeer private_property and call_out the National_Guard . But the National_Guard is not much help on the problems that most bedevil California today . There is no law for a governor to suspend when companies complain that Johnny may be able to read but can ' t perform other basic tasks required of entry-level employees in the modern_world . A governor does have a say in how much money the schools get and appoints members of the State Board_of_Education , which sets broad policies . But the schools really are run_by locally elected trustees . Fixing what ails them would take years even if everyone in state and local_government , the business_community and labor were_on the same political page , which they aren ' t . The same is true , to some degree , of the other issues in this campaign . Consider crime . While experts debate whether tougher laws have much bearing on criminal activity , a recent RAND study concluded that the new &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing law would reduce serious crime 28 % . That is a bullish assessment of the ability of the governor and lawmakers to improve the lives of the citizenry -- if they are willing_and_able to nearly double what the state is spending on its prison system . But even if that projection is accurate , it means that the lion ' s share of the serious felonies being committed would be unaffected by the toughest sentencing law enacted anywhere in the nation . There were 4 # 158 people murdered in California in 1992 . How many fewer killings must there be before Californians feel that crime is no longer an important issue ? A great_deal of crime , of course , is beyond the reach of stricter judges , longer sentences and more prisons -- the solutions advocated by those who would be governor . Demographics -- particularly the number of young males in their peak crime-committing years -- is regarded_as the most important factor . &quot; There ' s not a whole_lot you can do about it , &quot; said Peter Greenwood , an author of the RAND report . &quot; A lot of it reflects larger societal trends. &quot; The dynamics on other issues are similar . California ' s economy has suffered through an awful downturn mainly because it was hit by the twin blows of a national recession and reduced federal military spending . Governors -- in concert with the Legislature -- can raise or lower taxes , reduce or increase regulation , offer incentives for companies to stay here or expand , all_of which can affect the pace of economic_growth . &quot; The governor ' s decisions are important at the margin , &quot; said Lynn Reaser , chief economist for First Interstate Bank . But in the end , most experts say , the fluctuations in the state ' s $ 800-billion economy are more dependent_on whether the Federal_Reserve_Board raises or lowers interest_rates than whether the state , for example , trims the scope of its Endangered Species Act . On immigration , the other major issue in this year ' s race , a governor ' s direct powers are even more limited . States have no ability to control the nation ' s borders , and they play no role in deportation proceedings . A governor is pretty much limited to pressuring the federal_government into action , a task that Wilson has pursued with great vigor . Although the governor may be the state ' s chief_executive , the job bears little resemblance to the CEO of a major corporation . Private executives answer only to their board of directors , whose members they often help choose . If the top_executives decide that change is needed , they make_it , then reap the rewards or suffer the consequences . But governors must share their power with the other branches of government . There are 80 members of the Assembly and 40 in the Senate . The governor needs a majority of those lawmakers for most major endeavors . The courts also can stand_in the way , as they have when Wilson has tried to cut public employee benefits and reduce welfare grants , among other things . The fact that the Constitution deliberately established competing branches of government to check the power of the executive does not make_it any easier for governors to accept the reality of their diluted authority . They know that voters -- thanks in part to the way campaigns are run -- hold them accountable anyway . Former Gov . Deukmejian , a Republican , often complained that the Democrats who controlled the Legislature tried to use their leverage to extract concessions from him whenever he proposed a new program or policy . &quot; That can be very frustrating , &quot; Deukmejian said . &quot; It ' s very difficult to understand how after you ' ve had a statewide election and the people have chosen this person to go_forward and carry_out the program , the promises , the pledges he or she made during the campaign , they can be thwarted or blocked or held hostage by one key legislator who was elected by just 1 / 80th of the people in the state. &quot; Yet the impact a governor does have can be enormous , if not immediate , and the results can be felt_for generations . Hiram Johnson in his two terms in the 1910s brought_forth the Progressive Era , wresting control of the state from the railroads and handing it to the public . More_than 70 years after Johnson left_office , the ballot initiative -- one of his creations -- still is being used by the voters to set policy that lawmakers refuse to enact . This time-release nature of a governor ' s accomplishments can make_it difficult to judge their record until well after they have left_office . Former Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown was trounced by Reagan when he ran_for a third term in 1966 . Years later , Brown was more appreciated for the vision he displayed in pushing development of a state water_project , parks , highways and the higher education system -- the infrastructure upon which California ' s boom business years were built . Deukmejian in his time was seen widely as a passive governor , little more_than a caretaker . But by reshaping the state ' s judiciary in his conservative image , he accomplished the one major goal he set for himself when he first ran_for the job . The young judges he appointed will be dispensing rulings from the bench well into the next century . Some governors leave lasting legacies that run counter to the popular images we hold of them . Reagan is remembered as a conservative ideologue , but he signed laws responsible_for such liberal staples as legalized abortion , automatic annual cost-of-living raises for welfare recipients , and the state ' s landmark Environmental Quality Act . Reagan , however , did articulate a conservative vision for the state , and later the nation , and in doing so took_advantage of what may be the governor ' s most important power : setting the agenda . No other state official commands the kind of attention afforded the governor , and a chief_executive can exploit that opportunity to move public_opinion , or to marshal it to pressure for change . &quot; Nothing is more powerful than a compelling idea , &quot; said state Controller Gray Davis , who was a top aide to former Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . California has become the prism through which the nation first notices fundamental shifts in its demographic composition , its multiculturalism , its relationship to Mexico and other Third_World countries . So when governors talk_about these subjects , what they say is heard throughout the country and around the world . &quot; If one would postulate that in the sixth-largest commonwealth on the planet that the executive_officer did not have this bully pulpit , then we are really in bad shape , and I don ' t think we are , &quot; said historian Kevin Starr . &quot; that ' s why the governor ' s race is so intense this time . It ' s a position worth having. &quot; A Governor ' s Power REALITY A governor ' s primary powers are to propose a budget , sign and veto legislation and organize the executive_branch . Other powers : * APPOINTMENTS : Governors also appoint the state ' s judges and the members of regulatory boards that do everything from setting utility rates to controlling development along the coast . * CLEMENCY : The governor has the power to grant clemency , which means deciding whether to spare a life or execute a condemned felon . * EMERGENCIES : During an emergency , a governor can suspend state laws and regulations , commandeer private_property , and call_out the National_Guard . * AGENDA : Many observers say that a governor ' s greatest_power is enumerated nowhere : the power to set the state ' s agenda and marshal public_opinion on behalf of a cause . RHETORIC KATHLEEN BROWN : &quot; Pete Wilson has had his chance and he has failed . That is the issue in this campaign. &quot; * &quot; I don ' t blame Pete Wilson for the national recession or the end of the Cold_War any more_than I blame him for earthquakes or fires . But I do blame him for his failure to lead California through this time of crisis and to provide leadership when people need it most. &quot; * &quot; We need to have leaders who can see the future , who understand it and who are willing to invest in it , who are willing to fight for it , and who care what happens to average Californians . That is why I want to be governor , and I ' m mad that this guy hasn ' t done the job for the last four years. &quot; * &quot; It really does matter who sits in the governor ' s chair when it comes_to restoring the promise of a quality higher education system to our middle-class families . It matters because , as governor , I will make_it my mission to defend the principles of affordability and accessibility that have been under assault these last four years. &quot; PETE WILSON : &quot; The governor of California must be many things -- a crisis manager when the earth shakes or the forest burns , a booster for California jobs across the country and around the world , a person of conviction who can stand_up for what ' s right no matter what the consequences or who ' s opposed. &quot; * &quot; I came_back from that pleasant academic cloister , the U.S. Senate , to make change , and I ' m running_for a second term as governor to continue fighting for the change we need to improve our jobs climate and overhaul our welfare system , to improve the quality of our schools and reclaim our streets from violent crime. &quot; * &quot; What has happened to California has happened because of the recession , because of Washington making deep , deep defense cuts . . . . ( Voters ) clearly think that they ' ve been through hell for the past 3 1 / 2 years , and they have . But they also are smart enough and honest enough to know that that is not of my making. &quot; About This Series In the heat of a gubernatorial campaign , the candidates sometimes dwell_on matters that have little to do with the larger problems facing Californians in the years ahead . Campaign rhetoric has far more to do with what appeals_to voters in the here_and_now . Between now and Election_Day , Nov . 8. , The Times will publish a series of stories -- State of the State : The Challenges Confronting California -- to provide a foundation for evaluating how the state is faring . Each story will include a description of what the candidates have said or done about these challenges -- and what they propose to do should Californians elect them governor . Today ' s story sets the stage by exploring the limits -- and possibilities -- of gubernatorial power . The other installments : * Changing population : Are demographic forces reshaping California more quickly than the political_system can react ? * Economy and education : Are California ' s schools providing an underpinning for the state ' s economic future ? * Fiscal straitjacket : Can the state_government solve its budget problems and provide_for future growth ? * Environment : How will California balance environmental protection against the pressures of economic need ? * Poverty : What are the living conditions of California ' s poorest citizens , and what do they auger for the state ' s future ?</TEXT>
