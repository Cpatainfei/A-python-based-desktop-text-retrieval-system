   <HEADLINE> SAFETY MEASURES TAKEN BY FORMULA ONE BODY ; AUTO RACING : SWIFT ACTION DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO REDUCE SPEEDS IN WAKE OF TRAGEDIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With two racers dead and a third in a coma , the organization that runs Formula One auto racing took drastic measures Friday to make the sport safer . Overriding its agreement with Formula One teams , the International Automobile Federation ( FIA ) unilaterally imposed measures designed primarily to reduce speeds . &quot; Anything that needs to be done -- anything that we think usefully can be done -- will be done , &quot; FIA President Max Mosley said . &quot; We don ' t have any choice. &quot; FIA has been pressured to act since the deaths of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil and Roland Ratzenberger of Austria in high-speed crashes during the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago . Then on Thursday , the first day of racing since Senna ' s death , Karl Wendlinger of Austria crashed during a warm-up before the opening qualifying session of the Monaco Grand Prix . Some of FIA ' s new regulations are to take_effect immediately after Sunday ' s race . The new regulations will reduce cars ' downforce , increase minimum weight limits and improve protection for the driver in the cockpit . The action is an apparent violation of the Concorde Agreement , which stipulates that the teams and the governing body must agree on any major changes to the sport . &quot; The time has come , because of the gravity of the situation and the force of public_opinion , to push_aside such considerations and do what is right in the general interest of the sport , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; What we want to put_forward does not meet with everyone ' s approval. &quot; Doctors at Saint Roch Hospital in Nice , France , said Wendlinger was being kept_in an artificial coma on a respirator to lighten the load on a brain bruise . His team said Friday it would not race Sunday . Meanwhile , in Australia , 1980 Formula One champion Alan Jones said the Monte Carlo course is unsafe because it does not have enough escape areas for cars in_trouble . &quot; Basically , the modern Formula One cars have outgrown the circuit , &quot; Jones said . &quot; It ' s dangerous in a lot of places , but at_the_same_time it ' s difficult to shift seven-story buildings to create more run-off ( areas ) . &quot; Because it ' s Monaco , the drivers continue to race there. &quot;</TEXT>
