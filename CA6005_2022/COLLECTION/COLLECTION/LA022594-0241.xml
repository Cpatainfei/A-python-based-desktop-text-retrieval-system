   <HEADLINE> HONG KONG GOVERNOR TO PUSH REFORMS ; ASIA : HEAD OF BRITISH COLONY TO MAKE PUBLIC DETAILS OF FAILED TALKS WITH CHINA ON ENCLAVE ' S FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Chris Patten announced Thursday that he will further press his reform campaign by making public an electoral reform bill that China strongly opposes and a sensitive government report detailing Britain ' s account of its failed talks with China on Hong Kong ' s political future . In a special_session of the_British colony ' s Legislative_Council , Patten said he will submit to the legislature on March 9 the remainder of a political reform package that put Britain and China on a collision course when he first unveiled it in October , 1992 . The bill will be published today , more_than a week before it is introduced in the Council . China denounced Patten ' s move and reiterated its previous threats to undo any reforms and dismantle Hong Kong ' s legislature when it assumes control of the colony in mid-1997 . Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said Britain will bear responsibility for refusing Beijing ' s demand that the reform proposals be withdrawn in exchange for a resumption of the talks , which broke_down in November after 17 fruitless rounds . Shen said Patten ' s announcement had &quot; slammed the door closed &quot; on further negotiations . Patten expressed regret over the lack of an agreement but said Britain had not closed the door . &quot; We want to talk on a whole range of issues and talk constructively , &quot; he said . &quot; Let us try to draw_a_line under this dispute and cooperate together in other areas in the interests of the people of Hong Kong. &quot; Patten got an implicit go-ahead on reform from the Legislative_Council on Thursday , when it handed him a crucial victory by passing a &quot; first stage &quot; bill containing the least contentious elements of the governor ' s reform package . Passage followed an unusually heated 10-hour debate between the reformers and more conservative and pro-Beijing legislators who prefer to dilute or defer Patten ' s package . The first bill lowers the voting_age to 18 from 21 , abolishes government appointment of local Council_members , halves the number of popularly elected legislators to one per constituency and allows some members of China ' s Parliament to run in Hong Kong elections . Patten ' s remaining bill would seal his entire reform program by next month . It contains steps that will significantly broaden the voting base for the 1994 municipal and 1995 legislative elections . Those elections will be Hong Kong ' s last before it reverts to Chinese control in 1997 . The governor said that publishing an account of the Sino-British talks will help the public understand the course he has taken . China objects to the disclosure , which would be unprecedented in nearly 12 years of mostly secret Sino-British negotiations .</TEXT>
