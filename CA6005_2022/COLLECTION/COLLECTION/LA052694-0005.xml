   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; ' GOLD ' MINES A WEALTH OF HISTORY ; THE BAROQUE EXHIBITION SENDS HOPEFUL MESSAGE OF PORTUGAL ' S RESILIENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Gold and Grandeur : The Age of the Baroque in Portugal &quot; is an exhibition with a story to tell . The story has two parts : One is of bristling international power and astounding aristocratic wealth in the 18th Century , which was suddenly shaken to the core by unspeakable devastation ; the other is of how Portugal miraculously climbed back from ruin . History is not the show ' s only interest , however . &quot; Gold and Grandeur &quot; is plainly being offered as an allegory for Portugal ' s precarious modern situation . As much as a sensuous wallow in often staggering past glories , it ' s a pep talk for the present , too . &quot; Gold and Grandeur &quot; began life as an exhibition last November at the National Gallery of Art in Washington . During the show ' s run , plans to add the San Diego Museum of Art as its only other venue were announced . It opened Sunday pretty much intact , although a_few signal pieces have been deleted . A rather smallish exhibition , its 118 objects have been given a generous array of gallery space on two floors of the Balboa Park museum . The show focuses almost exclusively on decorative arts -- furniture , silver services , porcelain and faience pots , jewelry , religious vestments and such -- including the blue-and-white painted tile panels called azulejos common to Portugal . A monumental azulejo panorama showing early 18th-Century Lisbon -- it ' s 66 feet long -- is among those few works that haven ' t made the westward trek . Also , unless you see the show by the end of the first week in June , you ' ll miss one of its most arresting religious objects : the &quot; Sacramento Monstrance &quot; ( circa 1760 ) , an astonishing sculptural concoction for displaying a consecrated host behind a glass window surrounded by a halo of jewels . A life-size , genuflecting angel of gilded , polychromed wood holds aloft a 400-pound sphere of highly polished , jewel-encrusted silver surrounded by an aureole of tapering silver rays . The monstrance towers over mere mortals who stand before it . The composition is based on the classical motif of Atlas struggling to carry the heavens on his shoulders . Unlike the pagan Titan , however , this angel isn ' t working_up a sweat . An unknown craftsman designed the monumental monstrance with such illusionistic skill as_to make the huge , light-reflective silver sphere appear to float serenely in the space above the enraptured angel ' s head . Since the ostentatiously displayed wafer represents the body of Christ that miraculously ascended into the heavens , it ' s a powerfully realized metaphor . The &quot; Sacramento Monstrance &quot; will be removed from the show June 6 because it must return to Portugal to serve as the identifying logo for Lisbon ' 94 , a yearlong arts festival . Lisbon is this year ' s so-called &quot; Capital of Culture , &quot; a changing designation made annually by the European Union to help boost tourism and trade among its member nations . * For Portugal , the designation is significant . Since the mid-1980s , its free-marketeer prime_minister , Anibal Cavaco Silva , has directed landmark growth ; the once-isolated nation on the Atlantic end of the Iberian Peninsula has been integrated into the European Union . Recently , the country climbed out of the economic cellar among EU member-nations , surpassing Greece . The American museum exhibition is important to Portugal , too . U.S. loan shows of foreign treasures often carry symbolic weight to bolster pragmatic goals . In the 1970s , artifacts from King Tut ' s tomb helped prepare the way for a dramatic change in Middle_East foreign_policy . In the 1980s , &quot; Mexico : Splendors of Thirty Centuries &quot; underscored an ongoing shift toward economic privatization in Mexico and helped grease the wheels for NAFTA . In the 1990s , Portugal is making a bid . The aspirations for &quot; Gold and Grandeur &quot; might not be extravagant , but they ' re unmistakable nonetheless . As the small , poor nation labors to dramatically increase economic_growth and to reach_out to an international marketplace , it has assembled an exhibition that celebrates the remarkable fruits of an earlier period of phenomenal expansion . Portugal in the 18th Century was incalculably rich , thanks to a firm foundation of colonialist exploits around the globe . With the uncovering of huge deposits of gold , diamonds and other precious_stones in Brazil , the little kingdom was catapulted into the stratosphere of European powers . European Baroque culture is marked by rambunctious designs depicting expansive growth , organic profusion and constant movement . In painting , horizon lines often lower or even disappear , replaced by pictorial suggestions of infinity . Sculptural stasis is banished , in favor of swirling dynamism or voluminous airiness . Luxury abounds . The show , which features spectacular samples from the world ' s largest collection of royal silver and enough gigantic jewels to choke De Beers , attests to the Portuguese dream of rivaling France ' s aristocracy in its glutted display of sumptuous excess . Designs indigenous to China , Brazil and other sites of Portuguese conquest are reinterpreted in writing desks and pottery . And much of the work in the exhibition wasn ' t made in Portugal ; instead it reflects Portuguese taste , and the economic power to import products of skill and fashion from England , France , Italy and Germany . The dominant Baroque motif of lush , organic growth added a blaring aura of moral rightness to the Colonial carnage necessary to maintain such rapacious pomp . The style made power seem a force of nature . Nowhere is the political use of Baroque imagery more outrageous than in an immense carriage meant to carry a Portuguese ambassador to the Vatican to wow the Pope . The carriage ' s back_end , which approaches the complexity of a Rose Parade float , features a gilded carving of the personification of Portugal , attended by allegorical figures of prosperity and triumph , lording over a captive Moor and a vanquished Turk . The captives are portrayed as entirely too satisfied with their ignominious fate . All this gold and grandeur was rudely interrupted in 1755 , however , when an earthquake said to have shaken for some 13 minutes reduced Lisbon to a pile of gilded rubble . The temblor killed more_than 10 # 000 inhabitants ( the king , by chance , was out of town ) , set_off nine days of raging fires and destroyed countless artistic treasures . * Eighteenth-Century Pat Robertsons declared the natural disaster to be God ' s revenge on a profligate people . The monarch , bolstered by the iron will of the brilliant Marques de Pombal , nonetheless proceeded to rebuild the city on a modern , rationalist plan . The diamonds encrusting subsequent jewelry got_even bigger . One of the show ' s two paintings , installed at the entrance , is a stiff , 1766 portrait of Pombal seated high above a serenely rebuilt Lisbon , his masterful reconstruction plans strewn at his feet and sky ' s-the-limit clouds rolling past his head . The painting is dull and didactic , but its symbolism for present-day Portugal is striking . Portugal , led by its Capital of Culture , is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the start of recovery from its contemporary equivalent_to the brutal destruction caused by the 18th-Century earthquake . In 1974 the vicious , 40-year rule of Western Europe ' s longest-lived modern dictator , Antonio Salazar , came_to an end . &quot; Gold and Grandeur : The Age of the Baroque in Portugal &quot; looks_back at an earlier moment of prosperity interrupted by cruel disaster . Indeed , the show ' s dazzling display seems almost as calculated as the gilded back-end of the ambassadorial carriage that is its centerpiece . We came_back from ruin once , the show forthrightly declares ; surely we can do_it again . * San Diego Museum of Art , Balboa Park , ( 619 ) 232-7931 , through Sept . 6 ; closed Mondays .</TEXT>
