   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; JOEL OTTERSON ' S FURNITURE HURTS SO GOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brutality and luxury intermingle in Joel Otterson ' s polymorphous pieces of excessively decorative yet fully functional furniture . Mounted on small , heavy-duty wheels , his hyperactive hybrids of recycled pipes , dismembered bathtubs , patchwork cushions , potted plants and goldfish bowls speak -- in many voices at once -- of an irrepressible desire for physical comfort in a world relentlessly hostile to pleasure , refinement and lavishness . Shoshana Wayne Gallery ' s cavernous main space at the new Bergamot Station complex feels_like some futuristic pirate ' s hide-out . The treasures here have been pillaged from a wild array of mass-cultural sources . Delicate dessert dishes emblazoned with rock ' n ' roll logos recall grandma ' s mismatched china and the grandchildren ' s favorite bands . Odd candelabrum do double duty as fruit bowls . A Cher ashtray conflates summer-camp arts-and-crafts with High Style camp . And a fragile glass decanter , with matching goblets cast from plastic bottles of dishwashing liquid , demonstrate Otterson ' s ability to make beautiful objects out of common household materials . His aesthetic of over-the-top accumulation is exceptionally resilient . It embodies a sensibility that is adaptive and practical , capable of making the best out of adverse circumstances . Chippendale sophistication and Road Warrior ruggedness seem to be the unlikely bedfellows from whose union Otterson ' s art springs . The animated glee of his multilayered pieces includes a healthy dose of reality . Far from being an escapist fantasy of outlandish piracy , his voracious installation is a moving meditation on art ' s place in contemporary life . A 1961 jukebox , flanked by two life-size human skeletons made of ruby red , hot-sculpted glass , serves as funerary urn for the ashes of Richard Alan Shiffler , a musician who recently died of AIDS-related complications on his 33rd birthday . Otterson ' s poignant memorial fuses fragments of popular culture and pieces of plumbing to form a personal shrine that provides different levels of comfort , depending_upon what each viewer brings_to it . All of these flamboyant sculptures take their place in an ongoing cycle of life and death . They make a necessity of decoration , stealing fugitive pleasures from an impersonal world and striving to infuse some joy amid much sorrow . * Shoshana Wayne Gallery , Bergamot Station B - 1 , 2525 Michigan Ave. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 453-7535 , through Nov . 7 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Endurance Test : Visiting Mike Kelley ' s exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery feels_like being trapped in a building whose burglar_alarm has been accidentally triggered . Lights flash and ear-splitting sounds assault you as you wander around the makeshift sculptures , paintings , drawings and photographs , wondering if you should wait for someone to silence the annoying noises or if you should just give_up on the art and leave . With a nasty , aggressive twist , Kelley transforms the difficulty usually associated with Modern art -- particularly abstraction -- into a painful endurance test . Masochism , his work effectively screams , lies at the root of the way Americans currently think_of art . The idea that looking_at art is good for us gets skewered in his pugnacious installation . Spending time with Kelley ' s enlarged photographs of lint , sculptures made of chicken-wire and tinfoil , and egg-shaped paintings based on a fusion of 1950s horror movies and biomorphic abstraction does not result in any sort of moral improvement . On the contrary , all you ' re left with is a headache . For such bodily ailments , Kelley ' s drawings in the back gallery sarcastically recommend Immodium A-D , Pepto-Bismol or acupuncture . The remainder of the exhibition resembles ill-fated , back-yard experiments by a crackpot scientist or handyman . Leapfrogging back to the wacky birdhouses he made in the 1970s , Kelley ' s new works focus_on eggs and incubator-like containers , suggesting that art ' s job is not to offer moral improvements but to hatch ideas , creating new , mutant forms , however distasteful they might be . * Rosamund Felsen Gallery , 8525 Santa Monica Blvd. , ( 310 ) 652-9172 , through Oct . 8 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Pricey Gamble : Hiro Yamagata is a graphic_artist whose mass-produced screenprints have assured his commercial success but have earned him little critical recognition . &quot; Earthly Paradise , &quot; a well-financed exhibition at the Los Angeles Municipal Art_Gallery at Barnsdall Park , is meant to alert viewers to Yamagata ' s significance as a serious contemporary artist . The plan backfires . Badly . Yamagata ' s schematic , tacky paintings of tropical plants , gorgeous flowers and snazzy toucans , adorning seven perfectly restored , 1951-52 Mercedes Benz Cabriolets , get things drastically backward . These brightly colored pictures on fenders , doors , hoods and trunks might be fine as murals along the freeway or as innocuous designs for beachwear . As embellishments of the cars , however , they look terrible . Yamagata ' s paintings detract from the beauty of the rare , hand-assembled convertibles . Worse , the attempt to secure Yamagata ' s significance as an artist is based on a cynical belief that contemporary art is meaningful because it ' s expensive . Art is pricey not because its materials cost a lot -- as Yamagata ' s certainly do -- but because it coveys ideas and elicits experiences a culture deems to be valuable . Yamagata ' s effort fails because it puts too_much emphasis on money , forgetting that while high prices are often the result of art , they are not its cause . * Los Angeles Municipal Art_Gallery , Barnsdall Art Park , 4800 Hollywood Blvd. , ( 213 ) 485-4581 , through Oct . 23 . Closed Mondays . * A Focused Edge : Linda Burnham ' s paintings at Christopher Grimes Gallery are sharper , less cluttered and more resolved than any of her previous images , in which stylized designs and calligraphic flourishes energetically overlap with silhouettes of frogs , bugs and bears , as well as a wide variety of patterns , textures and techniques . The crisp clarity of her new paintings is_due , in part , to their being collaborations -- of a sort . Burnham made this body_of_work on unfinished canvases left_behind by her husband , artist Robert Overby , at his death last year . Ghostly outlines of lips , eyes and fingers remain from his wispy , linear sketches . These soft details appear to hover beneath the surface of Burnham ' s more thickly built-up layers of oil , alkyd , acrylic and resin . The contrast between her tactile accumulations of gooey paint and his shadowy , seemingly intangible after-images yields a delicate tension that gives these paintings their off-balance edge . Unlike Burnham ' s earlier works , which seem tentative and excessively indebted to the styles of other artists , her most recent paintings are bold and focused . They signal her maturity as a painter . * Christopher Grimes Gallery , 916 Colorado Ave. , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 587-3373 , through Oct . 15 . Closed Sundays and Mondays .</TEXT>
