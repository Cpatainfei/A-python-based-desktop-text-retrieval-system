   <HEADLINE> TYCO IN $ 1.4-BILLION DEAL FOR KENDALL INTERNATIONAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of the largest mergers in the medical products industry , Tyco International Ltd . said Thursday that it will acquire Kendall International Inc. , which makes Curad bandages and other disposable medical products , for $ 1.4 billion in_stock . The move by Exeter-based Tyco , which also manufactures a broad range of goods including fire-protection systems , gives it a firm position in the high-profit area of disposable medical products , the company said . Under the definitive agreement , Tyco will issue Kendall shareholders $ 60.45 worth of its stock for each Kendall share . Following news of the deal , Tyco ' s stock fell and remained lower for the rest of the day . It closed at $ 45.625 , off $ 1.75 , while Kendall shares rose $ 3 to $ 54 , both on the New York Stock_Exchange . Tyco said the deal should close before the end of the year . The acquisition &quot; represents a quantum leap in ( Tyco ' s ) disposable medical business , &quot; Chief_Executive L . Dennis Kozlowski said . &quot; Our processes and equipment are virtually identical to those currently in_use at Kendall , which should allow us to share manufacturing efficiencies and technology , &quot; he said . &quot; The Kendall merger is a very important step_in the strategy we developed several years ago to translate our manufacturing expertise in packaging into higher-margin products in the disposable medical products market. &quot; The company said the transaction will create a $ 1.2-billion business segment that will serve as a platform for future growth . Kozlowski compared the proposed Kendall merger to Tyco ' s creation and expansion of its fire-protection business in the late 1980s . That operation now has revenue of about $ 1.6 billion a year , he said . Tyco said Richard Gilleland , Kendall ' s chairman and chief_executive , will continue as Kendall ' s president and become a Tyco director . Gilleland said in a statement , &quot; This transaction provides a number of advantages and opportunities to Kendall , including Tyco ' s fast-growing $ 80-million medical disposables business. &quot; In the same announcement , Tyco said its board has authorized the buyback of up_to 2.9 million of its common shares , or about 10 % of the shares to be issued in the acquisition . The acquisition of Mansfield , Mass.-based Kendall brings under Tyco ' s umbrella a broad line of home health_care products . These include adhesive bandages and gauze pads , elastic supports , hosiery , diabetic products , durable medical equipment and incontinence care products , sold under the brand names Curad , Curity and Futuro .</TEXT>
