   <HEADLINE> UCLA FORECAST FOR STATE IS SURPRISINGLY ROSY ; ECONOMY : REPORT SAYS CALIFORNIA WILL SEE A 1 % NET GAIN IN NEW JOBS IN 1994 AS RECOVERY MOVES FASTER THAN EXPECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California will see an increase of 111 # 000 net new jobs in 1994 -- a better performance than the flat job growth predicted earlier -- as the state ' s fledgling recovery proceeds faster than expected , according to a report expected to be released today by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project . While that 1 % rate of job growth is less than the long-term state average of 3 % , it is nevertheless another sign that the economy is getting better , UCLA said in its most optimistic forecast since the recession began in 1990 . And while structural changes in the economy will continue to roil the state ' s job market for several years , UCLA predicted that an upturn in normal economic cycles will generate a net gain of more_than 770 # 000 new jobs in the next three years . That would make_for a compound annual growth_rate of 2.1 % in non-farm jobs . &quot; Although suffering from continuing job losses in defense-related aerospace , due_to budget_cuts and consolidation elsewhere , we believe this recovery will last , &quot; the report says . The report , issued every three months , is more optimistic than the June forecast , which predicted a 0.1 % drop_in employment for 1994 . The optimism is all_the more striking because the UCLA group had come under_fire from business during the recession for being unduly pessimistic in its forecasts -- predictions that turned_out to be largely accurate . Even with continuing aerospace layoffs such_as those from the recently announced Martin Marietta-Lockheed merger and the virtual shutdown of Hughes Aircraft ' s Fullerton complex , California will &quot; not go_back into recession , &quot; according to the forecast . The unemployment_rate , meanwhile , will fall from about 9 % -- or nearly three percentage_points above the national rate -- to 7 % in 1997 , due_to more jobs and population shrinkage as people look elsewhere for work . The state rate will remain about a percentage_point above the national average . The forecast is in keeping with other recent predictions that the state ' s economy will continue to improve . In June , the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy predicted that the state could add 310 # 000 jobs a year by 2005 , a rate_of_growth that would outpace the nation ' s . Walter Hahn , an economist with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co . in Newport Beach , agreed with the UCLA projections . But he added that Los Angeles County will continue to lag the rest of the state , saying job growth will not occur here until 1995 at the earliest . &quot; The problem is that L.A. County had 84 % of the state ' s total job losses in 1991 through 1993 , &quot; he said . Orange County , by contrast , will probably break_even in job growth this year , he said . UCLA predicted that most of the state ' s new jobs will be in the service sector , excluding wholesale and retail trade . Non-financial services will generate 96 # 000 of the 111 # 000 new non-farm jobs created in 1994 . The most robust growth will occur in the movie_industry , already one of the faster-growing industries in the state , with an average annual growth_rate of 11 % through 1997 . But even heretofore ailing industries should hold their own , the forecast says . Wholesale and retail trade will begin to add jobs in 1994 , accelerating in 1995 and 1996 as retail spending picks_up . Construction , which got an overnight boost after the Northridge earthquake , will also grow . The building trades will add 94 # 000 jobs from 1995 through 1997 , bringing that sector ' s employment back to 1990 levels . And employment in non-aerospace manufacturing is likely to remain stable through 1997 , the forecast says -- an improvement over its June prediction that manufacturing would continue to decline . The forecast notes that despite evidence that a California recovery is under way , consumers continue to feel pessimistic .</TEXT>
