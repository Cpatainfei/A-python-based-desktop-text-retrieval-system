   <HEADLINE> CHRYSLER IS ACCUSED OF RESELLING ' LEMONS ' ; AUTOS : DMV SAYS VEHICLES WERE PASSED OFF TO UNWITTING CONSUMERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA . COMPANY DISPUTES THE FINDINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A California state agency has accused Chrysler Corp . of reselling &quot; lemons &quot; to unsuspecting buyers without telling them it had repurchased the cars from previous owners because of defects . The Department of Motor_Vehicles said the allegations involve 118 Dodges , Jeeps , Chryslers and Plymouths sold to consumers through dealerships in Northern California . The model years are 1989 to 1992 . A Chrysler spokeswoman on Wednesday denied the allegations , saying the auto_maker is in full compliance with California law and disputes with the DMV ' s findings . &quot; We feel we have evidence that we have made_full disclosure and we have a meeting set_up with the DMV to go_over the material , &quot; spokeswoman Rita McKay said . She declined to give further details . If found guilty , Chrysler faces possible revocation or suspension of its license to sell cars in California , though a fine is considered more likely . General Motors Corp . paid $ 330 # 000 in April to settle similar charges , while denying any intent to defraud or mislead consumers . The DMV said its investigation shows that Chrysler delivered most of the repurchased vehicles to a Northern California auction_house , which then allegedly resold them to auto dealers . The dealers then allegedly sold the cars to consumers . The dealers and the auction_house have not been charged . A new car is considered a lemon in California if its defects are not fixed within four attempts or after 30 days in the shop during the first year of ownership . Car owners can sue manufacturers to force them to repurchase a car . The Center for Auto Safety , a Washington-based advocacy group , estimates that about 50 # 000 lemons are repurchased nationally each year . While it isn ' t known how many of them are then resold , consumer groups have called_for closer monitoring of what becomes of the vehicles . Motor Voters , a Sacramento consumer organization , argues that cars with serious mechanical defects should be sold for scrap only . The nature of the defects involved in the Chrysler case couldn ' t be learned Wednesday . Consumer advocates said that in_general , auto_makers repurchase cars only if problems are serious and beyond repair . &quot; Usually the ones they buy back are the worst ones -- the ones they can ' t repair . But if the manufacturer can ' t fix it , how can anyone else fix it ? &quot; asked Rosemary Shahan , president of Motor Voters . The DMV made the allegations against Chrysler on Aug . 17 in an administrative filing . It did not become public until Wednesday , when Motor Voters obtained a copy . The charges will be heard by an administrative_law judge , who will recommend a decision to Department of Motor_Vehicles Director Frank S . Zolin . Zolin may accept or reject the judge ' s decision , or render a decision of_his_own . In its charges , the DMV accused Chrysler of fraud and deceit in connection with the sale of the vehicles . The agency said Chrysler failed to include a statement disclosing that the car was repurchased because of a defect . The law also requires manufacturers to tell buyers what was wrong with the car , which the DMV said Chrysler failed to do . The DMV said only that its investigation resulted from a consumer complaint . But San Francisco lemon law attorney Brian Kemnitzer said he turned_over to the DMV records on 150 Chrysler vehicles that had been repurchased under the lemon law and resold to dealers at Golden Gate Auto Auction in Hayward . Auction officials could not be reached . The GM case involved 51 cars repurchased by the manufacturer and 34 Northern California dealerships , which were also charged . A DMV spokesman said the settlement with GM barred the agency from discussing the case . Lemon Aid Under California law , a new car is considered a lemon if a substantial defect affecting the use , value or safety of the car remains after four repair attempts or 30 days in the shop during the first year . Here are steps the consumer organization Motor Voters recommends to consumers who own lemons . * Try to resolve problem with the dealer . Keep all work orders and records of repair attempts . * If that fails , write the manufacturer . The address is in the owner ' s manual . * If you ' re still not satisfied , check to see if the manufacturer has an arbitration program . If so , you may file a complaint with the arbitration board . Typically , a hearing is granted within 40 days . * If you lose in arbitration , or if your vehicle manufacturer does not have an arbitration program , you may sue . A case may take_up to a year to get_to court . If you allege your car is unsafe or inoperable , it must be stored during that time . * If you believe you have purchased a car previously designated a lemon , you can also file a complaint with the state_Department of Motor_Vehicles .</TEXT>
