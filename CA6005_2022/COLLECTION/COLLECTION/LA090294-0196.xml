   <HEADLINE> FEDERAL AGENCY PROPOSES REGULATIONS FOR DERIVATIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal agency that regulates national_banks is proposing new rules requiring that these financial_institutions put aside more cash to cover potential losses on long-term derivatives contracts . The Comptroller_of_the_Currency is to publish the proposed regulations today in the Federal Register , opening_up the changes to public_debate through Oct . 21 . The rules are similar to those proposed by the Federal_Reserve_Board , the agency that regulates bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of its system . Derivatives are securities whose returns are tied to the value of one or more assets , such_as stocks , bonds , interest_rates or currencies , or indexes based on their value . They tend to be extremely volatile . Both the Comptroller_of_the_Currency and the Fed would require banks to increase their capital requirements for derivatives contracts of five years or more that are tied to equities , precious_metals and commodities . The rules would amend the Basel Accord passed in July , which regulates contracts tied to interest_rates and foreign_exchanges . &quot; If banks do experience losses , they have a larger cushion to fall_back on , &quot; said Janis Smith , a spokeswoman for the Comptroller_of_the_Currency . The American Bankers Assn . does not oppose the rules , because few banks are_active in the long-term derivatives contracts , ABA spokeswoman Stephanie Mullin said . &quot; The overall effect on banks under the new rules will be limited , &quot; she said . However , some banks recently have voluntarily infused millions of dollars into short-term derivatives contracts that have been included in mutual_funds sold to investors . For instance , Fleet Financial Group_a week ago announced it would inject $ 5 million into its money_market funds to prevent investor losses . Several bills aimed at regulating derivatives contracts have been introduced in Congress , including one by the House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez ( D-Tex. ) . Gonzalez ' s committee says that although the proposed regulations are a step_in the right direction , the industry still needs legislation . &quot; Although derivatives are highly volatile and at times risky , in the pursuit of profit , banks may choose to downplay the risks involved , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; Regulators , bending to their banking constituencies , might also be convinced to cut regulatory corners. &quot;</TEXT>
