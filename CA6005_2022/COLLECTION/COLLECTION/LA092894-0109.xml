   <HEADLINE> S . CAROLINA GETS REPRIEVE ON NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP ; ENERGY : ARRIVAL OF SHIPS CARRYING SPENT FUEL RODS FROM EUROPE IS DELAYED TO GIVE STATE MORE TIME TO BLOCK SHIPMENT IN COURT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal Energy_Department on Tuesday delayed the arrival of ships carrying radioactive waste from Europe , giving South Carolina more time to try to block the shipment in court . The two ships early Tuesday were several miles off the North Carolina coast . They contain 153 spent fuel rods from research reactors in Austria , Denmark , the_Netherlands and Sweden . The shipment is part of a U.S. effort to keep weapons-grade uranium out of the wrong hands . The materiel was to come_through Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal in Brunswick County , N.C. , then be shipped to the Savannah_River Site weapons plant near Aiken , S.C. , for storage . Last week , a three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals threw_out a lower court ruling blocking the shipment . The state contends that the Energy_Department used negotiations to delay a lawsuit , then allowed the ships to sail . As a result , the department now improperly claims the_matter is an emergency , the appeal says . State Atty . Gen . Travis Medlock said papers have already been sent to the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case there in case the 4th Circuit rejects the appeal . &quot; We will . . . use all means at our disposal to keep South Carolina from becoming the dumping ground for the world , &quot; Medlock said Tuesday . The Energy_Department has encouraged reactor operators around the world to stop using highly enriched uranium fuel and move to a type of uranium that cannot be easily converted to weapons use . The federal_government promised to take_back all_the spent fuel it sold to operators of foreign reactors . The department wants to import a total of 409 fuel elements in the next six months and 10 # 000 to 15 # 000 during the next 10 to 15 years .</TEXT>
