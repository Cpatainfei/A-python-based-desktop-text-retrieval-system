   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / BARBARA BOXER : HEALTH_CARE OF WOMEN ISN ' T NEGOTIABLE ; ABORTION COVERAGE FOR ALL MUST BE INCLUDED IN ANY REFORM PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Passage of health-care legislation will be a defining moment for the women of this nation . For the 29 million women with no health_insurance , for the millions at risk for breast_cancer and for the 3 million who will face a crisis pregnancy , health-care reform holds so_much promise -- and so_much risk . In this , the greatest nation in the world , it is unconscionable that most women do not have coverage for preventive procedures like mammography ; that women under 30 , the group most likely to have children , are also the group least likely to have health_insurance , or that Congress has repeatedly failed to ensure that disadvantaged women have access to a full range of pregnancy-related services . We have a historic opportunity to change all this . If done right , health-care reform can address the specific and unique needs of this nation ' s women . If done right , health-care reform can ensure universal coverage and provide a full range of pregnancy services to all women . If it is not done right , it will represent not only a missed opportunity , but also a major step backward for many American women . There are those who will try to distort this issue and play politics , claiming that some pregnancy-related services are too controversial and should be taken_out of the health-care package . Unfortunately , they miss the point . Any health-care reform that does not adequately address the needs of women -- 52 % of the population -- is no reform at all . Real health-care reform means expanding private coverage , not taking_away benefits that we already have . Currently , two-thirds of private health-insurance plans routinely cover all pregnancy-related services . A recent public-opinion survey found that 68 % of voters want the health-benefits package to include medical procedures currently covered by private health_insurance . The new plan must_not take_away vital reproductive-health services that millions of women have today and may need tomorrow . For women facing crisis pregnancies , the difficult decision of abortion is for a woman , her family and her doctor , within the framework of her religious_belief . It must be made in the doctor ' s office , not in Congress . Health-care legislation working its way through Congress carefully addresses these moral and religious views by permitting health-care professionals or facilities to opt_out of providing abortion services . These legislative proposals make the point very clear : If you are morally opposed to a medical procedure , you cannot be required to perform it . This opt-out provision strikes the critical balance between respecting the beliefs of some and protecting the health-care needs of others . If Congress were to take the unfortunate step of scaling back the list of pregnancy -- related services , we would open a Pandora ' s box of possible discriminatory treatment in our new health-care system . Opposition to a particular medical service gives no one the right to redline the health-care plan for American women . If we do not allow coverage of abortion , where will this lead ? Will we eliminate coverage for contraception , AIDS or blood_transfusions because of the objections of one group or another ? President Clinton has forwarded to Congress a plan that provides health security to all Americans and helps improve a system that has too often neglected women . Congress must now act swiftly to enact real health-care reform . If we fail , the impact on women will be swift and devastating . Eliminating the full range of pregnancy-related services will not reduce the number of abortions . It will only make abortion more difficult and dangerous , putting women ' s lives and health at risk . It will mean that fewer doctors will perform abortions . Women will have to travel farther and delay medical_care . Safe medical abortion , available in only 17 % of the counties in the United States , will become increasingly difficult to obtain . And there will be more unintended pregnancies , higher rates of infant_mortality and more babies born too early , too small and too sick . We are standing at a crossroads . We can choose the path that will endanger the health and lives of countless women by eliminating coverage for abortion . Or we can allow those providers with conscientious_objectors to opt_out of abortion services while providing insurance coverage for the full range of pregnancy-related services , ensuring that abortion remains safe and , at_the_same_time , far less necessary . The contrast is stark , the choice clear .</TEXT>
