   <HEADLINE> A LONG-BURIED OIL SPILL CASTS BEACH TOWN ADRIFT ; POLLUTION : UNOCAL IS REMOVING TAINTED SOIL FROM AVILA BEACH , BUT BUSINESS_DISTRICT MAY GO WITH IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All Mike Rudd wanted to do was build a commercial building in the heart of this quaint , dilapidated beach town . But when he struck oil , his hope of revitalizing the town was doomed . Rudd , the owner of an Avila Beach bikini shop , discovered oil that had leaked for decades from Unocal Corp . pipelines running under the main_street of town . As it turned_out , more_than 22 # 000 gallons of crude_oil , diesel_fuel and gasoline had quietly contaminated the soil and ground_water beneath the business_district of this seaside haven , eight miles south of San Luis Obispo . Unocal , whose hilltop tank farm looms over Avila Beach like a medieval castle , bought Rudd ' s land and began cleaning_up the spill . The oil giant acknowledges responsibility for the spill , which it knew of as far back as 1977 , but predicts that it will be at least five years and perhaps far longer before the mess under the town and its popular beach is finally cleaned_up . &quot; They knew oil was seeping down here and they didn ' t say anything to anybody , &quot; Rudd said as he looked_out_on his old property , fenced and vacant . &quot; The thing that makes me the most mad is they haven ' t done anything about it. &quot; The spill has brought commercial development and real_estate transactions to a virtual standstill because banks will not lend money on the contaminated property . Some townspeople worry that the spill may pose a health risk , although Unocal and health officials say there is no known danger . Worse yet , complete decontamination confronts the town with perhaps the ultimate irony : Local merchants fear that the most thorough cleanup -- removal of the tainted soil -- could mean demolition of the four-block business_district and the destruction of their livelihoods . &quot; It ' s basically killed the town is what it ' s done , &quot; said Jim Cumming , owner of the Avila Pizza Pantry , half a block from the beach . &quot; The only way to clean it up is to dig_up the whole town. &quot; For Unocal , the contamination at Avila Beach is yet another black mark on its record of operations on the Central Coast . In March , the Los Angeles-based company disclosed that it was responsible_for the largest oil spill in state history : as much as 8.5 million gallons of petroleum thinner that leaked into the ocean and ground_water from pipes at its Guadalupe oil field , 15 miles south of Avila Beach . Throughout California , state officials say , leaks from underground pipelines have come_to pose a major oil pollution threat , causing spills on land , in creeks and rivers , and in the ocean . &quot; It ' s a big problem because what you ' ve got is a very antiquated infrastructure of pipelines in California and they ' re not holding , &quot; said Steve Sawyer , an attorney with the state Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response . &quot; We ' re dealing with pipes that have been buried for 40 or 50 years . After a while , corrosion sets_in and you get breaks. &quot; Responsibility for monitoring more_than 8 # 000 miles of buried petroleum pipelines is divided among various state agencies , and some leaks go undetected or unreported for years . State officials cannot say for_sure how many pipeline breaks occur , but estimate that there are hundred of leaks , large and small , each year . Just since January , 1993 , more_than 800 # 000 gallons of petroleum products have spilled from ruptured pipelines into such sensitive locations as the Santa Clara River near Valencia , McGrath Lake near Oxnard , School Canyon Creek in Ventura and Grapevine Creek near Ft . Tejon . There also have been major pipeline breaks_in residential_areas , including a 1989 gasoline leak that exploded and killed two people in San Bernardino and a 1988 rupture that spilled more_than 130 # 000 gallons of oil onto city streets in Encino and Sherman Oaks . This month , Gov . Pete Wilson signed a bill that would strengthen inspection and reporting requirements for underground pipelines . State Resources Secretary Douglas Wheeler , concerned that the state ' s aging network of pipelines will lead to further catastrophes , said he will seek additional measures to improve spill prevention and emergency response to land-based oil spills . &quot; There is a growing awareness of the seriousness of the environmental risk , &quot; Wheeler said . &quot; We have only more of these incidents to expect . We have to be_better equipped to predict them and , when they do occur , be_better prepared to deal with the effects of a rupture. &quot; The town of Avila Beach , with a population of just over 1 # 000 , has long been dominated by the oil operations that surround it . The tank farm on the_hill above town is nearly a century old and was acquired by Unocal in 1906 -- in a card_game , according to local legend . At the other end of town , the company built a pier where it loads and unloads petroleum products on tanker ships . More_than a dozen pipelines run under Front Street -- the main_street of town -- from the pier to the tanks . Five of them are still active , pumping crude_oil and refined products back and forth for storage and distribution . Other pipelines also deliver crude_oil from the San Joaquin Valley to the huge tanks and to a refinery down the coast . In the early 1980s , Avila Beach was a bastion of resistance to construction of the Diablo Canyon nuclear_power plant seven miles away . Now , residents ruefully note that they have become victims of fossil_fuels , not atomic_energy . The town seems to be stuck_in a 1950s time warp where strip malls and fast-food joints have yet to arrive . A few new houses have been built_on the_hill above town , but Front Street has hardly changed in four decades . One-story , flat-roofed buildings , separated by vacant_lots , line one side of the street across from the wide sandy beach and fishing pier . A chronic water shortage has allowed little growth , and the town ' s last commercial building was constructed in 1963 . &quot; It ' s one of the last , if not the last , unspoiled beach towns in California , &quot; said Nancy Argo , who runs a beachwear store on Front Street with her husband . &quot; It ' s not Carmel . It ' s not Newport Beach . Time has stood_still here. &quot; Hoping to bring modest improvement to the commercial strip , the citizens of Avila Beach arranged last year to buy water from the state , ending years of a building moratorium . They quickly learned , however , that oil contamination , not water shortages , would spoil growth plans . Jim Bray , a spokesman for Unocal , said it is difficult to determine when pipes under Front Street began leaking or even how much fluid seeped out . &quot; It was leaking for some time , &quot; he said . &quot; No one knows for_sure how long. &quot; But Bray said the breaks occurred before the mid-1970s , spilling an estimated 15 # 000 gallons of diesel , 7 # 000 gallons of gasoline and an unknown amount of crude_oil . The plume of contamination extends well under the beach and fishing pier , but apparently has not seeped into the ocean . The problem came_to_light in 1977 , when petroleum fumes collected in the basement of a building on Front Street and exploded . At the time , Unocal fixed a pipeline leak and installed an underground wall to hold_back future seepage but did not attempt to clean_up contaminated soil . &quot; My understanding is that it was brought_to our attention in 1977 , &quot; Unocal spokeswoman Terry Covington said . &quot; At that point , there was a barrier wall put_in to protect Front Street from the contaminated area . Obviously , that wasn ' t sufficient. &quot; It was not until 1989 , when Rudd began to develop his nearby property , that the problem resurfaced . This time , the extent of the contamination became public and Unocal promised to clean_up the spill . &quot; I think it ' s a crying shame Unocal can do this to just ordinary people , &quot; Rudd said angrily . &quot; I would n ' t buy a gallon of Union Oil gasoline if I was dying . I don ' t think anyone who comes_to Avila Beach should ever buy another gallon of Union Oil gasoline. &quot; Bray , however , noted that the company did not take action sooner because today ' s standards are much different from those of the 1970s . &quot; At the time , no one thought there was a wider problem than the immediate leak at the site , &quot; he said . &quot; Environmental laws and the way of doing business have changed a lot in the last 15 years. &quot; Avoiding a potential lawsuit , Unocal bought Rudd ' s property for more_than $ 500 # 000 . Today , the choice land across from the fishing pier is empty except for wells that monitor the seepage . Unocal officials say they have undertaken a long-term effort they believe can clean_up the contamination without requiring the removal of any buildings or unduly disrupting the town . The company installed a permanent vapor recovery pipeline under Front Street in 1992 to capture underground gases from the spill and pipe them up_to the tank farm , where they are burned . In addition , Unocal began a program of &quot; bioremediation &quot; -- aerating the soil so that bacteria naturally present in the ground would consume the spill at a faster rate . Bray estimated that the bioremediation will take at least until 1999 , and possibly much longer , to clean the site . The oil_company has also offered to guarantee loans for property_owners who want to develop , refinance or sell their property , but no such transactions have been completed . More important , Unocal has quietly begun purchasing and leasing contaminated property on Front Street , including buying the well-known Avila Grocery and Deli . Officials at the Regional Water Quality_Control Board , which oversees the cleanup , say they were not notified of any spill at Avila Beach until 1989 and are not satisfied with the pace of the cleanup since that time . &quot; There haven ' t been any aggressive methods of removal , &quot; said senior engineer Robert Baldridge . Earlier this month , the board voted to set a cleanup standard for Avila Beach that is far stricter than the 100-parts-per-million threshold used until now by Unocal . In ground_water , for example , the board set a limit of 1 part per billion for benzene and 1 part per million for total petroleum hydrocarbons . Evelyn Delany , chairwoman of the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors , believes that tougher standard will compel Unocal to seek a more drastic solution -- decontaminating the town by excavating tons of tainted soil , up_to 15 feet deep . Most of the buildings that sit over the contamination could be saved , she said , but some might have to be destroyed . &quot; I think ultimately they ' re going to have to dig_out the contaminated dirt and dispose_of it properly , or clean it , and fill the town with clean dirt , &quot; the supervisor said . &quot; Some of the buildings can be jacked_up and held_in place while they are removing the dirt and putting_in new dirt . I think demolition would be a last resort. &quot; Massive excavation , causing disruption of the entire commercial area and loss of business , is exactly what some residents fear will be needed . &quot; They ' re going to have to clean it up and it ' s going_to put me out of business . They ' re going to have to bulldoze , &quot; said Micki Sue Leister , who owns a beachwear shop and food concessions on Front Street . The anger is widespread . &quot; They have a way of losing a lot of petroleum products and not telling anybody , &quot; said Cumming , who had hoped to build a small motel next to his pizza restaurant . &quot; They ' ve been working_on ( the cleanup ) for five years and basically gotten nowhere . They ' re buying_up the town but that ' s no solution to the problem. &quot; Others complain that word of the spill and frequent work by Unocal tearing_up Front Street for the vapor recovery system have combined to hurt business . &quot; Avila Beach used to be a paradise , &quot; said Bill Price , owner of a Front Street beachwear store . &quot; We don ' t have crime . We don ' t have stoplights . But we do have contamination. &quot; Slow Spill Crude_oil , diesel_fuel and gasoline that leaked from Unocal Corp . pipes prior to the mid-1970s have saturated the soil under Avila Beach ' s main commercial street and its popular beach .
