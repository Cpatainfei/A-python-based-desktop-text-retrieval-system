   <TEXT> CABLE READY : Apparently being part of the multi-corporate team backing a new music video / home shopping cable TV channel isn ' t enough for Ticketmaster . The company -- which has joined EMI Music , PolyGram , Sony Music and the Warner Music Group to create a video music channel to challenge MTV -- is preparing to launch its own Ticketmaster Channel , devoted to tickets , concert merchandise , records and videos . Look_for it to be in_operation within 90 days . Ticketmaster CEO Fred Rosen would n ' t comment on the new channel , but acknowledges that he and the company ' s new owner , Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen , &quot; will clearly be investing in and be part of other opportunities that are involved in the entertainment highway of the future. &quot; Bruce Haring</TEXT>
