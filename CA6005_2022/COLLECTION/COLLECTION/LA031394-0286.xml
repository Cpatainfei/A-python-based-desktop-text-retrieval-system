   <HEADLINE> STILL BROKE , MICHIGAN SCHOOL FIGHTS TO STAY OPEN ; EDUCATION : KALKASKA SAYS IT WILL MUDDLE THROUGH UNTIL JUNE 3 THIS TERM , BUT FACES A $ 500 # 000 DEFICIT DESPITE CANCELING BUS_SERVICE AND CHARGING STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS . OTHER STATE SCHOOLS FACE SIMILAR PROBLEMS . TUESDAY , VOTERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO RAISE TAXES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Driving 10-year-old Kim to school before continuing on to work has become second nature for Irene Beltnick . She ' s been doing_it since September , when Kalkaska schools cut bus_service to save money . Getting Kim home each afternoon can be trickier , but they manage . &quot; It just takes a little more planning and forethought , &quot; Beltnick said with a resigned smile as her daughter bounced from the car outside Birch Street Elementary School . The struggle continues in Kalkaska , the small factory town and retirement haven in northern Michigan that lost its anonymity a year ago when school closed 10 weeks early . With money running_out and irate taxpayers refusing to give more , officials chose a shortened calendar over the deep program cuts necessary to operate a full 180-day year . On March 24 , students began &quot; summer vacation &quot; with snow on the ground . Since then , voters twice have shot_down attempts to raise property_taxes . But officials of the 2 # 100-student district say this time they will muddle through until the scheduled closing June 3 . The school_board last fall reluctantly accepted cuts it previously had rejected -- eliminating bus_service , cutting nearly 50 jobs , slashing the athletics budget and charging players $ 50 per sport . A number of other Michigan districts have done likewise . Still , this year ' s $ 8.6-million budget is $ 500 # 000 in the hole because of state aid cuts and rising costs , Kalkaska Supt . Doyle Disbrow said . There will be a $ 300 # 000 deficit next year even if the spending_cuts remain and a salary freeze continues , he said . Shortening the year by more_than 20 % made Kalkaska a symbol of money problems afflicting the nation ' s public_schools . &quot; It awakened people even more_than they had been previously to the seriousness of the problem , &quot; said Bob Chase , vice_president of the National Education Assn . The teachers ' group supported Kalkaska ' s early closure . Critics in the Legislature and Gov . John Engler ' s administration said it was unnecessary and accused the school administration of mismanagement . Forbes magazine labeled the move &quot; a union-orchestrated stunt &quot; aimed at blackmailing taxpayers with_children as hostages . But even critics acknowledge it may have been the final straw leading to the Legislature ' s abrupt decision last summer to dump the property_tax as the chief source of education funding in Michigan . The move ended a 20-year stalemate over fixing a system that produced increasingly wide funding gaps among the state ' s school districts . &quot; They ' d have muddled right along , doing nothing , if we hadn ' t acted , &quot; said Rik Ponstein , head of the Kalkaska teachers ' union . Now Michigan voters must choose a new funding system . A statewide referendum will be held Tuesday on Proposal A , which would boost the sales tax from 4 % to 6 % . It would retain a token tax on residences and a bigger levy on business property and would triple the cigarette tax to 75 cents a pack . If the proposal loses , the Legislature has approved a fallback plan to raise the state income_tax from 4.6 % to 6 % , levy some property_taxes and increase taxes on cigarettes and other items . In Kalkaska , the coming vote has generated little of the passion stirred by local property_tax campaigns . Few seem convinced that Proposal A or the fallback plan would solve their schools ' money woes . &quot; They don ' t come anywhere close , &quot; Disbrow said . He predicted Kalkaska and dozens of other districts would not have enough money next year to continue their current programs . Mike Addonizio , state assistant school_superintendent , said many districts might consider their funding inadequate under the new system . But he said it will boost state education spending from $ 9.6 billion to $ 10.2 billion next year while other programs will be lucky to avoid cuts . Proposal A and the fallback plan promise each district a minimum grant of $ 4 # 200 per pupil next year , rising to $ 5 # 000 within five years . Kalkaska spends about $ 3 # 800 per pupil now , so next year ' s total figures to be about 10 % higher . The average district ' s increase will be around 5.2 % , Addonizio said . Kalkaska ' s boost may seem generous , Disbrow said . But he contends it still won ' t buy a quality program because the district is so far behind . &quot; Nobody would say they ' ll be_on easy street , &quot; Addonizio said . &quot; But they ' re getting a bigger per-pupil revenue increase than most districts around the state. &quot; Whatever happens , Kalkaskans say they ' ve learned to make the best of things . When school ended prematurely , some parents tutored children in a church basement . When the buses were grounded , they formed car pools . When the band needed new uniforms , they held a beef-stew dinner to raise money . &quot; People get the impression this is a little hick place that can ' t take_care of itself , &quot; said Alan Belt , father of two students . &quot; We ' ve really pulled together. &quot;</TEXT>
