   <HEADLINE> AS WILD SALMON FADE , NORTHWEST LOSING A SYMBOL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a growing sense_of_shame , if not surrender , the Pacific Northwest is watching its wild salmon dwindle into extinction . This year , the federal_government will impose the strictest fishing limits in history , and it may go so far as_to ban a salmon harvest in the ocean north of Ft . Bragg , Calif . But no one expects even extreme steps like this to bring the salmon back . That would require the Northwest to change the way it lives , or to have change imposed upon it . Otherwise the wild salmon , the red-fleshed symbol of bountiful life in the Northwest , are likely to disappear except for &quot; museum &quot; or &quot; cameo &quot; runs in isolated areas , experts predict . And this could happen in just a decade . &quot; We are at the brink , and we ' re looking down into the abyss , &quot; said Geoff Pampush , executive_director of Oregon Trout , an environmental and sporting organization that is among those sounding the alarm . The decline of the wild salmon can be told as a dense story of modern hydroelectric economics , overlapping governmental jurisdictions and foundations of growth and commerce 150 years in the making . Or it can be expressed in stark simplicity : too many people with too_little regard for what seemed , and may still seem to some , to be a resource without end . In historic terms , scientists guess that 100 million salmon a year once emerged from the rivers along the coasts of California , Oregon and Washington . Today , these fish are extinct in Southern California , and the remainder of the region produces perhaps 15 million a year -- most of them from hatcheries . * Looked_at another way , 107 separate stocks of salmon have already become extinct in the Pacific states , and 89 others are &quot; at high risk of extinction , &quot; according to Seattle-based Save Our Wild Salmon , a coalition representing environmental and fishing groups . Stocks , or runs , of salmon are those of a single species that emerge from the same freshwater spawning grounds , travel_to the ocean together and return to spawn again at_the_same_time . That means there can be hundreds of separate stocks , which the government typically regards_as genetically distinctive creatures under the Endangered Species Act , even though there are only five actual species of salmon in the Pacific : chinook , sockeye , coho , pink and chum . Closely related and also suffering in the region are anadromous steelhead and sea-run cutthroat trout . The decline of the Northwest salmon was decades in the making . By 1990 , it had become a crisis the public could not ignore . Four years ago , the first stock was listed on the endangered species list : a winter run of chinook on the Sacramento River . Then came runs of chinook and sockeye from the Columbia-Snake river systems . Since then , the plight of the fish has worsened . Commercial and sport fishing_seasons have been reduced along much of the coast , leaving fishing communities in the same economic distress as the logging towns of the region . And the federal Pacific Fishery Management Council will meet Tuesday in Burlingame , Calif. , to contemplate the ultimate step : A complete ban on ocean salmon fishing for 1994 in Washington , Oregon and Northern California to 35 miles south of Ft . Bragg . At the very least , the council has signaled that it will allow less salmon fishing than ever before . State officials typically follow the council ' s lead when it comes_to fishing in state waters and rivers . Still , government regulators acknowledged in this month ' s Fishery Council newsletter : &quot; These strict harvest reductions may stop the decline . . . but they will do little to restore abundant stocks. &quot; The fishing restrictions result chiefly from a precipitous decline in coho stocks from coastal streams . These coho numbered up_to 400 # 000 in 1990 , but only 74 # 000 now . The National Marine Fisheries Service will decide this summer whether to add some or all_of these stocks to the endangered species list . The good news is that Sacramento River autumn-run chinook are robust enough to sustain fishing below Ft . Bragg for 1994 . To the north , the causes of the salmon decline are as simple to describe as they seem almost imponderably difficult to fix : * Degradation of spawning streams that lace through the Northwest from the coast to 1 # 000 miles inland . Roads , development , agriculture , logging all share the blame . * Dams and water diversions , particularly on the mighty Columbia_River system , which today resembles less a river than a series of connected bathtubs . * The worst possible combination of natural_phenomenon : eight years of below-normal rainfall and sustained El Nino ocean conditions , which seem to reduce the availability of food for migrating salmon . * A favorable turn of nature could prevent a complete collapse of the coastal coho population for now . But virtually every credible source acknowledges that without a significant change in the way_of_life here , the Northwest will forfeit its bounty of wild salmon . &quot; The question is : Are we willing to adapt to the demands of biology ? &quot; said Tim Stearns , coordinator for Save Our Wild Salmon . &quot; From the day white settlers first came , they have adapted the Northwest to their needs . Now , are we willing to adapt to the needs of the Northwest ? &quot; The listing of salmon as threatened and endangered finally forced Northwest residents to acknowledge the problem . Years of political and social struggle over forests and northern spotted owls has left this region keenly aware of what happens when old ways of resource management come_into conflict with modern preservation laws . But the magnitude of change necessary to revitalize the salmon is so staggering as_to test not just the region , but the nation . Even the optimists have their doubts . &quot; Some of these stocks we can save , and some are doubtful , &quot; said Ted Bottiger , chairman of the multi-state Northwest Power Planning Council . The government_agency was created to watch_over the complicated hydroelectric power_system of the Northwest , and it is the first to bring_forth a plan to rebuild salmon stocks on the Columbia_River . Already , more water is being allocated in the system for salmon , meaning a reduction in peak-time power generation and an overall hike in hydroelectric rates . Electricity is cheaper here than anywhere else in America , but even modest increases upset the regional economy . Aluminum producers colonized the area because of its abundant , dirt-cheap electricity . Now the industry has begun layoffs and blames the rising rates -- and by implication , the salmon . * Tens of thousands of other Northwest residents are being asked to change as well : farmers to change the way they irrigate , loggers to change the way they cut watersheds and silt streams , cities to change the way they zone for subdivisions and growth . And scientists can identify hundreds of millions of dollars in needed repairs_to the natural landscape -- for instance , the relocation of road culverts that now block 30 # 000 miles of river tributaries . As it is , the regional Bonneville Power Administration says it spends more_than $ 200 million a year on hatcheries and other projects to try to keep the salmon going_against the mighty concrete impoundments of the Columbia , the most heavily dammed major river in the United States . Not just dams but the torpid waters behind them work against these migratory fish . How can the young swim downstream if there is no stream ? If they do not reach salt water when their body clocks change them into ocean fish , they die . Today , tens of thousands of smolt are loaded into tanks and barged down the river . Environmentalists and fishing enthusiasts say the process is absurd and unsatisfactory . More water must be released on the schedule of the salmon , not according to electricity demands , they argue . Some go_further and insist that the only way to save Columbia_River salmon is to pull_down some of the great dams . * Irrigators , shipping lines , the aluminum_industry and other river users recently signaled that they were tired_of being_on the defensive . They struck back with an argument that may prove to be the weakest link in the preservationists ' cause : There is no shortage of salmon for the dinner_table . Even as the wild fish decline , farmed salmon from Norway , Chile and the United States keep markets around the world plentifully stocked . &quot; Only in the Pacific Northwest can you buy an endangered species for $ 2 per pound , &quot; said a recent newspaper_ad from the Columbia_River Alliance , a group of river users based in Portland , Ore . The alliance is lobbying for an end to large-scale net fishing in the river . For their part , these netters have joined with environmentalists in blaming the dams and river users for the decline of the salmon . &quot; I ' m pessimistic , &quot; said fish scientist and consultant Jim Lichatowich of Sequim , Wash . &quot; Some people are still in denial and understandably worried about the short-term consequences this is having_on them . I don ' t see the long-term focus needed for salmon recovery. &quot; Perhaps that will come later this summer . The National Marine Fisheries Service is expected to finalize its recovery plan for Columbia_River salmon . Federal regulators have broad powers to protect endangered species , but there is only scant hope here that the government will offer enough to satisfy the environmentalists without asking too_much of the river industries . From the Northwest ' s experience with owls and forests , such a recovery plan is more likely to send all sides rushing to the federal_courts , Congress and the Clinton_Administration . Last Monday in Portland , U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh ruled that 1993 federal approval of hydroelectric operations on the river failed to adequately protect salmon under the Endangered Species Act . Apart from the court action , the Administration last month proposed a stopgap reduction of logging , grazing and development within 300 feet of salmon streams on all federal lands in the region . In a statement , the Administration said its goal was &quot; to reverse the degradation of anadromous fish habitat on Forest Service and ( other federally ) administered lands in_order to avoid the need for more listings under the Endangered Species Act. &quot; And another battleground is likely to erupt . Native_Americans along the river have treaty rights that they believe entitle them to a harvestable abundance of salmon . In the past , federal_courts have shown a willingness to hold the government accountable for these native rights no matter the high cost to non-native immigrants . &quot; One lesson whites learned from the natives when we came here -- salmon are the Northwest , &quot; said Sierra Club Regional Director Bill Arthur . &quot; No other animal weaves our culture , our economy and our environment like the salmon. &quot;</TEXT>
