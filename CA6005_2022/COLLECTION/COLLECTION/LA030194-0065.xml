   <HEADLINE> RESOLVING CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let me congratulate the Conejo Valley Unified School District on its recognition that we need to teach kids how to resolve their differences other_than by violence . It ' s time to stop just doing what comes naturally . Violence comes naturally . We need to go beyond what ' s easy and teach nonviolent conflict resolution , including mediation . One text I recommend for use with teen-agers and adults is former President Jimmy_Carter ' s &quot; Talking Peace , &quot; which deals with nonviolent conflict resolution techniques between individuals and nations . Countering violence with violence is ineffective . Offenders need justice . Pre-offenders need to be taught new ways of dealing with problems before they escalate to violent levels . Let us be peacemakers , not just peacekeepers . DIANE DAILEY VENABLE Thousand Oaks</TEXT>
