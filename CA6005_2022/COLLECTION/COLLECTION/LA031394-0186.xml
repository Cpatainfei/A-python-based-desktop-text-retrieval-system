   <HEADLINE> COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE DIVIDED ON IMPACT OF ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beyond the promise of safer streets and the threat of overloaded courts , Ventura County law_enforcement officials say the new &quot; three strikes &quot; law aimed at career felons carries a load of question_marks . While prosecutors were weighing the first &quot; three strikes &quot; cases last week , officials disagreed over whether the law -- meant to imprison repeat felons for 25 years to life -- will reduce crime , hobble the courts or truly deliver justice . But all agreed on this : The law will achieve its main goal of getting some violent criminals off the street , but it will take time for its side_effects to become clear . The first effects will be felt on the street , they said . The law could be put to good use in Santa Paula to take chronically violent gang members off the street , Police_Chief Walt Adair said . &quot; When you have people that are walking_around that have absolutely no compunction about killing someone , they just have to be removed , &quot; Adair said . &quot; People that rape and rob and maim other people just have to be removed from society , since they have proven they have no intention of rehabilitating their life. &quot; But Oxnard Police_Chief Harold Hurtt said the law will not deter ruthless criminals still on the street from hurting people . Hurtt agreed that some people &quot; need to be locked_up forever. &quot; But the law is mistargeted , he said . &quot; I think ' three strikes and you ' re out ' works extremely well on individuals like you and me , where we ' ve got something to lose . We fear going_to prison , &quot; Hurtt said . &quot; But I don ' t think it ' s going_to have much of an impact on individuals that are not in the ballgame . . . . You ' re spending_money on individuals that are already lost to society. &quot; The $ 21-billion estimated cost of building new prisons to house &quot; three strikes &quot; convicts for life would be_better spent on schools , crime prevention , drug intervention and mental_health care , Hurtt said . &quot; It ' s almost like continuing to pour money into a bankrupt business , &quot; he said . The law also will affect how accused felons are prosecuted and defended . Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury said his office is already reviewing cases to be prosecuted under the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . &quot; At this point , my job is to make_it work , &quot; said Bradbury , who had lobbied against the law in favor of a narrower version known as the Rainey Bill , preferred by many prosecutors and judges . While the bill signed last week by Gov . Pete Wilson allows juvenile crimes to count as strikes , the Rainey Bill would not . The Rainey Bill would trigger a life sentence only if the third crime were also a serious and violent felony . Under the new law signed by Wilson , any felony can be considered a third strike if the first two were violent . * The California District_Attorneys Assn . is preparing a set of suggested guidelines for prosecutors on how and when to apply the new law , Bradbury said . Otherwise , prosecutors in various jurisdictions might use the law differently , Bradbury said . &quot; We ' re hoping we ' ll get some unanimity in our approach , &quot; he said . Bradbury and Chief Deputy Dist . Atty . Kevin J . McGee are weighing whether to use the law against Preston A . Shelton , 36 , of Oxnard , the first Ventura County resident with at least two felonies to be arrested for a third since the law was passed . Shelton , a parolee twice convicted of armed robbery , was arrested on suspicion of cultivating seven marijuana plants -- a felony -- just hours after the law took_effect last Monday , McGee said . This arrest may_not be the kind of clear-cut case the law was designed for , McGee said , but it was the first to fall_under the law . &quot; The law required us to consider this case , &quot; he said . &quot; It would not be the case we would necessarily choose if we had the luxury of choosing . . . but it ' s the case that circumstances have presented us with and it ' s the one we have to prosecute first. &quot; McGee said Preston may have many_more felonies on his record , but prosecutors are still researching it . Bradbury said his office will try to use the &quot; three strikes &quot; law fairly , meaning that prosecutors might choose not to apply it , say , in the case of a two-time felon who commits a third , nonviolent felony after 15 or 20 years of obeying the law . Ventura County Public_Defender Kenneth I . Clayman predicted that the law could create &quot; terrible injustices. &quot; &quot; People are genuinely aggrieved over crime , as they should be , &quot; Clayman said . &quot; And selfish politicians are glomming onto this fear and whipping it up in the most demagogic way they can do_it without a proper analysis of all_the proper arguments and debate . And these ( cases ) are going_to get stampeded through. &quot; It also will cause a greater number of trials as accused felons choose to fight their charges rather than plead guilty , as the majority of defendants have in the past , Clayman said . But Bradbury brushed_aside the specter of gridlocked courts . Similar predictions of doom failed to gel after the passage of previous get-tough measures , such_as Proposition 115 and Bradbury ' s own policy against plea_bargaining in felony cases , he said . &quot; You may initially see an increase in trials , but it will return to an acceptable level very quickly , &quot; he said . In any case , court officials said they already are bracing for the possibility of a case overload , and might have to assign some civil court judges to hear criminal trials , they said . &quot; I ' m not sure how carefully all_of this was analyzed , &quot; said Presiding Superior_Court Judge Melinda A . Johnson . &quot; The cost we ' re going to see is in terms of time. &quot; The state Judicial Council ' s office has said Ventura County ' s courts already are short three Superior_Court judges and two Municipal Court judges , considering the size of its caseload , Johnson said . &quot; What really gets_to me in terms of planning is it was only a year and a half ago the Legislature told us to go_on the fast-track system for civil trials , &quot; Johnson said , referring to the requirement that civil suits be tried or settled within a year of filing . &quot; Now a year and a half later they could well have doubled our criminal load. &quot; The greater number of cases will be falling on the back of a court system already struggling with change . The Municipal and Superior_Court support_systems have already merged and some judges are already being cross-assigned . Now , judges are preparing to switch assignments if the &quot; three strikes &quot; caseload demands it , said Presiding Municipal Court Judge John R . Smiley . &quot; It remains a big unknown -- we don ' t know how many_more cases are going_to be going_to trial , &quot; Smiley said . &quot; I ' m not one of the doomsayers , &quot; he added . &quot; All I ' m saying at this point is if there is a significant impact , the impact ' s going_to be_on the other participants in the criminal justice system -- the sheriff , the California Department of Corrections and the judicial system. &quot; Sheriff Larry Carpenter predicted the law might help decrease the jail population when third-time felons who might have served one-year sentences there are sent_away to state_prison instead . The question , he said , is whether it is the fairest approach to putting career criminals out of business . &quot; ' Three strikes and you ' re out ' is a great concept , &quot; but it should be applied carefully only to third-time violent offenders , said Carpenter . &quot; If someone early in their life has a_couple_of convictions and then gets_it right and goes_on for 15 or 20 years living a good life and then writes a bad_check at the department_store , they ought not be locked_up for the rest of their life , &quot; said Carpenter . * Noting the irony of a law_enforcement officer worried about overly harsh penalties , he said : &quot; It almost sounds like those of us in the business have become social_workers , and the politicians on the outside have become law-and-order nuts. &quot; Carpenter said he , too , backs the Rainey Bill , which could get_to the governor ' s desk in the near future . But even if the Rainey Bill is signed , superseding the current law , it could in turn be superseded by a &quot; three strikes &quot; voter initiative that seems headed for the ballot in November . That measure , circulated by a Fresno photographer , Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was killed by a repeat felon , mirrors the law Wilson signed last week . Officials say it will be many years before the long-range effects of &quot; three strikes &quot; become clear . In addition to the estimated $ 21-billion prison construction tab , the Judicial Council estimated that the additional recurring cost in courts could top $ 250 million a year . &quot; It will add cost to the prison level , &quot; Bradbury conceded . &quot; But what we quickly forget is it costs $ 21 # 000 to $ 27 # 000 a year to incarcerate someone in the penitentiary . And conservatively estimated , that person would cost society $ 187 # 000 in crimes , &quot; he said , citing figures from the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning . But Oxnard ' s Chief Hurtt pointed_out that incarceration is still an expensive cure . &quot; I was talking to a representative of the Boy_Scouts , &quot; he said . &quot; They told me they can serve 8 # 000 kids in a Boy_Scout program , where it takes a similar amount_of_money to lock_up three people for a year . &quot; When we talk_about crime and quality_of_life on our streets . . . we need to weed out the extremes on both ends and come_up with something that ' s sensible and workable that ' s going_to provide a positive impact on our quality_of_life , &quot; Hurtt said . In any case , lawyers and probation_officers are already reconsidering strategies for accused third-time felons or even first- or second-timers who are headed for court , said Cal Remington , deputy director of the county Corrections Services_agency . &quot; If you have someone who has a prior serious felony and now they ' ve committed another one , those attorneys are going_to be less apt to plead their clients out , &quot; Remington said last week . And whether convicted felons heed the law once out of prison , they will get ample warning about the consequences of re-offending , he said . Remington added , &quot; If you have someone who is given probation and has two serious felonies , I think certainly the probation office is going_to make_it clear to the person that the stakes are extremely high. &quot; * HEAT IS_ON : Repeat offenders are feeling the pressure of tough law .
