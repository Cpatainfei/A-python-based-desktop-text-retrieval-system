   <TEXT> MOVIES Case Closed : A threat to withdraw the R rating of Miramax Films ' &quot; Ready to Wear &quot; was dropped Monday by the Motion_Picture Assn . of America after the distribution company won MPAA approval for a revised ad for the film , the MPAA said . A hearing scheduled for Thursday on the possible rating revocation was canceled . The dispute centered around film-related advertising that featured a semi-nude photo of supermodel Helena Christensen . The MPAA said the ad had not received approval from its Advertising Administration . Last Friday , Miramax used the image again in trade ads protesting the MPAA ' s policy , which prompted the threat of a revocation . On Monday , the MPAA released a letter from its counsel , Richard M . Cooper , to Miramax ' s counsel , Alan M . Dershowitz , explaining the organization ' s position . An MPAA spokesperson said Miramax had responded by agreeing that the ad would only be published in black-and-white . The Robert Altman-directed film opens on Christmas_Day . * ' Seduction ' Suit : Backers of &quot; The Last Seduction &quot; are planning a press_conference this morning to announce their next move_in an effort to qualify the film for Academy Award consideration . Heck , everyone knows their lawyer is Pierce O ' Donnell ( who won all that loot for Art Buchwald against Paramount Pictures ) so a lawsuit must be brewing . The problem is that the film , which is bringing accolades to star Linda Fiorentino , was shown on HBO before it went_into the movie_theaters . And the rules of the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences say that films that open on the tube can ' t be considered for Oscars . The rub is that the New York Film Critics Assn. , which plays by its own rules , last week deemed Fiorentino the year ' s best actress for her role in the film . And the L.A. critics recently gave a special award to director John Dahl for his efforts . Distributor October Films and ITC Entertainment Group say they have appealed_to the academy without success . Thus , the press_conference at 10 a.m. today at the Four Seasons Hotel and , it ' s expected , a quick trip to Los Angeles Superior_Court . * Support for ' Pulp ' : Texas film critics came riding to the support of their Los Angeles colleagues , agreeing that &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; is the best film of the year . The 20 Texans , whose vote was revealed in Austin over the weekend , joined growing pre-Oscar support for the dark comedy about hitmen and racketeers in Los Angeles . Last week , the New York Film Critics went thataway , picking &quot; Quiz Show &quot; as their favorite flick . * Brits Clear ' Killers ' : British movie censors said Monday they have reversed themselves on blocking the release of director Oliver Stone ' s &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; The British Board of Film Classification had banned release of the film in November because of alleged links between the picture ' s violence and killings in the United States and France . But the board has now granted an adult rating , saying there was no proof &quot; ordinary people had been turned_into killers by being exposed to a particular film. &quot; TELEVISION The Nation Watched : President Clinton ' s speech from the Oval Office Thursday night attracted about 60 % of the viewing audience in Nielsen ' s 32 big-city markets . NBC , which had &quot; Seinfeld &quot; and &quot; ER &quot; waiting in the wings , averaged a 14.3 rating and a 22 % audience share , compared to 9.8 / 14 % for ABC , 7.8 / 12 % for CBS and 6.7 / 10 % for Fox . The address and GOP response also were carried_on PBS and CNN . * Howser Strikes ' Gold ' : Public television_reporter Huell Howser has received double good news : Wells Fargo Bank will continue underwriting his &quot; California ' s Gold &quot; series for the 1995 and 1996 seasons . The series airs on 13 PBS affiliates statewide . And L.A.-oriented &quot; Visiting . . . With Huell Howser &quot; will be underwritten for 1995 by the Ralph M . Parsons Foundation . The programs will be paired at 6 and 6:30 p.m. Saturdays on KCET-TV starting in January . * They Love Lassie : The career of Hollywood ' s No . 1 dog , Lassie , will be celebrated in an hourlong special on ABC Thursday at 8 p.m. &quot; Lassie Unleashed : 280 Dog Years in TV &quot; will feature tributes from Dennis Franz , Charles Grodin , Kermit the Frog , Susan Lucci , Phyllis Diller , Dave Thomas , former Vice_President Dan Quayle , Dick Clark and stars from the long-running &quot; Lassie &quot; television series : June Lockhart , Jon Provost and Tommy Rettig .
