   <HEADLINE> HEADLANDS PROJECT TO GO_ON BALLOT ; DEVELOPMENT : DANA POINT COUNCIL ORDERS REFERENDUM AS PART OF NOVEMBER ELECTION ON PROPOSAL FOR A HOTEL , COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND UP TO 370 HOMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forced by a petition drive , the City_Council on Tuesday voted to place the Headlands project , one of the most controversial developments ever proposed in South County , before city voters in November . &quot; I ' m glad the community will finally have a say in this plan , &quot; said City Councilman William L . Ossenmacher . &quot; that ' s the best thing that could happen . Those of us who believe_in representative government and democracy will be glad , whatever the results are. &quot; The unanimous council action means city voters on Nov . 8 will decide the fate of the Dana Point Headlands . The council ' s only option was to rescind its April 5 vote approving the Headlands plan . For the past three years the plan has been the focus of an increasingly bitter local debate that will play a major role in next month ' s council election and continue until the November vote . The plan allows the landowners to build a 400-room hotel , two commercial centers and a maximum of 370 homes on the 121-acre Headlands peninsula near Dana Point Harbor , one of the county ' s last undeveloped coastal properties . Opponents of the development have insisted that the Headlands is a local landmark and that most of it should be preserved as a natural_resource . Proponents say the city needs the revenue that development could provide . Immediately after the council approved the plan in April by a 4-1 vote , a grass-roots group circulated petitions demanding a local referendum . In 15 days , the group managed to get 2 # 346 verified signatures , well_over the 1 # 912 required to force the council to reconsider its vote . The successful petition drive caused immediate suspension of the plan and a detailed development agreement , pending further council action . Council_members had a choice of calling a special election or putting the Headlands referendum on the November ballot . The petition came too late to qualify for the council election on June 7 , according to City Clerk Sharon L . Waits . Council_members chose November because the estimated $ 16 # 700 cost is about half that of a special election . They also said the expected 60 % voter_turnout in November would provide a better survey of local opinion on the Headlands plan than a special election , which generally draws fewer voters . Councilman Mike Eggers , one of the Headlands plan ' s most vocal supporters , said he thinks the voters ultimately will support the plan . &quot; Those 2 # 246 signatures in no way represent a mandate of the voters , &quot; Eggers said . Under state election law , if the plan is rejected , the council could wait a year and approve it again , Waits said . Since the 1940s the Headlands has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co . and Chandis Securities Co . Chandis Securities , a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family , is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co . which publishes the Los Angeles Times .</TEXT>
