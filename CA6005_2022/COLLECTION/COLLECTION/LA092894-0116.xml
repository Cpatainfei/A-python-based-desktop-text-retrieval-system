   <HEADLINE> POLICE PANEL CALLS FOR SEX HARASSMENT , BIAS UNIT ; LAPD : A COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS AN INDEPENDENT DIVISION TO INVESTIGATE INTERNAL ACCUSATIONS . COMMISSION VOTE IS DELAYED SO WILLIAMS CAN STUDY THE PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to growing complaints about sexual_harassment and discrimination within the Los Angeles Police_Department , the Police Commission is considering the creation of a unit that would strip the LAPD of primary responsibility for investigating those charges . Under a proposal painstakingly drafted by an ad_hoc committee consisting_of commission members Deirdre Hill and Art Mattox , the unit proposed Tuesday would be responsible_for investigating all discrimination and harassment complaints . It would be housed outside any existing LAPD facility -- a move intended to reassure employees making complaints that they would not be subject_to retaliation and that their complaints would be treated confidentially . A scheduled vote on the proposed unit was delayed for a week Tuesday after Police_Chief Willie L . Williams asked the commission for more time to study the proposal and Asst . City Atty . Byron R . Boeckman advised the panel that the public may_not have been given adequate notice of the vote as required by state law . Williams said he supported creating the unit , but he took_exception to removing it from the day-to-day operation of the department . &quot; It sends a chilling message to the 10 # 000 employees of the department when you say : ' None of you can be trusted to conduct an investigation , ' &quot; he said . Under the proposal , Williams would be given authority to review any disciplinary action recommended against a department employee . But initial investigative responsibility for all complaints of harassment and racial and sexual discrimination would lie_with the new unit , which would report to the Police Commission -- not the Police_Department . The proposed unit represents a compromise between advocates of placing the entire process within the Police_Department and those who argue that it should be completely independent of the LAPD . &quot; I feel very strongly that we need to create this unit in the Police Commission , &quot; commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr . said at Tuesday ' s meeting , adding that he would not want that misinterpreted as distrust of department employees . Williams argued that the public and Police_Department employees &quot; expect the chief to know about complaints and to do something right away. &quot; Taking the unit out of the department ' s chain of command &quot; flies in the face of the responsibility and accountability &quot; the public expects from the department ' s command staff , he said . Hill disagreed , saying the commission must play a role in establishing what the standards of the department will be . Moreover , she said , the department focuses_on discipline while the new unit will pay more attention to the needs of victims of discrimination and harassment . Mattox reminded Williams that under the committee ' s proposal he would be notified of any complaints . * Commission member Rabbi Gary Greenebaum noted that &quot; the department is changing , but it has not yet completed its change . Until that time , we need to provide some sort of sanctuary where people feel comfortable coming forward. &quot; The new unit would have 13 staffers , including one police_officer , and an annual budget of $ 662 # 000 if it is approved and fully funded by the City_Council . The proposal also recommends that cases referred to Internal Affairs be assigned two investigators . Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg told the commission that she thinks the council wants the unit established and that she will take personal responsibility for initiating discussions about funding . The proposed unit would represent the LAPD ' s most serious commitment of resources to rooting_out sexual_harassment and discrimination within its ranks and would mark the Police Commission ' s most assertive step toward having its staff investigate internal LAPD complaints . The report , presented to the full commission Tuesday , states that the ad_hoc committee ' s &quot; response to recurring criticism of the present system is to offer a process that provides_for appropriate consideration of the victim by shifting the focus of the investigation from discipline to compliance with city and department policies and the tenets of employment discrimination law. &quot; Creation of the unit has been widely discussed since early this year , when the LAPD embarked_on an aggressive attempt to root_out sexual_harassment at one of its police_stations and news_reports documented an array of harassment and discrimination complaints arising from the ranks . But the commission ' s recommended unit differs in important respects from one outlined by Williams in previous interviews and public statements . Most significantly , Williams had suggested that any new investigative unit needed to report to him in_order to tackle delicate personnel issues raised by sexual_harassment and discrimination complaints . The commission , backed by many council_members and outside observers who worried that a new unit within the LAPD would lack credibility , chose a different course . Under the commission proposal , Williams would retain the ability to discipline any department employee who was found guilty of discrimination or harassment . But investigation of those complaints would rest with the commission unit ; LAPD Internal Affairs investigators would only handle those cases referred to them by the unit . Although the unit ' s structure would differ from Williams ' proposal , commissioners praised the chief for his dedication to tackling harassment and said they believed the unit would effectively handle that task . &quot; We ' ve been lucky to have a chief of police who has taken aggressive steps to say that sexual_harassment will not be tolerated , &quot; Hill said . &quot; The practical realities of this issue are that the unit has to be responsive and has to be trusted. &quot; Hill said she hopes the council will support the unit and approve funding for it quickly . If that happens , she said , the department could bring a consultant on board within a month to begin laying the groundwork for establishing the unit . That could clear the way for the unit to be up and running within six months , Hill said . Commissioners are sensitive to the city ' s formidable budget problems , Hill and others said , but also noted that lawsuits alleging discrimination and harassment have been costing the city increasingly large sums to defend and settle in recent years . By comparison , Hill added , the unit is a relative bargain .</TEXT>
