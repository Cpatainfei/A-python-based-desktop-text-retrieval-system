   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : CONTRARIANS OFFERING A WAY TO HEDGE YOUR BET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are ways to protect yourself against a possible stock_market plunge without having to stash your cash under a mattress . One strategy might be to invest in a mutual_fund that ' s positioned to profit the next time stock prices tumble . The idea of taking a defensive posture with mutual_funds is nothing new . Several well-known portfolios enjoy leeway to flee to the safety of cash when their managers think the market is ready to sink . But a_few aggressively contrarian funds are more_than just defensive -- they ' re actually looking_to reap big profits from falling stock prices . How do they hope to accomplish this ? By stocking up_on gold shares , using futures and options to exploit a broad market decline and selling individual stocks short . A short_sale , the most radical of the three approaches , is the opposite of a regular or &quot; long &quot; transaction . The idea is to sell borrowed shares now at what you think is a high price . Then you pray the stock tumbles , allowing you to buy the shares at a lower price , repay the loan and close_out the position at a profit . The most notable new entrant in the small field of funds that do much shorting is Robertson-Stephens Contrarian of San Francisco . This fund has raised $ 200 million since its debut in late June . It returned 11.9 % during the second_half of 1993 , about four points better than the average stock fund . In designing the portfolio , manager Paul Stephens said he wanted to maintain maximum flexibility to move among different asset categories . Although the fund can make major bets either in favor of or against the stock_market , the current position is downright bearish . At the moment , the fund ' s holdings include : * A 25 % stake in growth gold mining_companies , reflecting gold ' s reputation as a hedge against inflation and social uncertainty . * Another 25 % in_stocks sold_short -- notably niche beverage companies , restaurant_chains and high-flying technology stocks . * 16 % in the common shares of nickel , aluminum and copper stocks , which also would be expected to fare well if higher inflation returned . * 15 % in cash ( Treasury_bills ) , a low-risk investment . * 6 % in real_estate stocks , another potential beneficiary of higher inflation . * 4 % in put_options on the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index , which would surge in value if the stock_market dived . * 2 % in call_options on gold stocks , which would hit pay_dirt if the underlying shares rallied . With this mix , Stephens is making a major bet that the decade-long trend toward low interest_rates , low inflation and higher stock prices will soon reverse . Even if you don ' t agree with this forecast -- and it ' s worth emphasizing that the stock_market has been very kind to loyal investors over longer periods -- Stephens feels his portfolio is a good way to hedge your other mutual_fund holdings without having to sell them . He views Robertson-Stephens Contrarian ( ( 800 ) 288-7726 ) as a lower-cost , lower-minimum alternative to private hedge_funds , which are limited partnerships designed for high-end investors -- typically those with $ 250 # 000 or more to spare . One of the salient features of private hedge_funds is that their managers typically take a 20 % cut of any profits , says Stephens , who runs some hedge partnerships himself . By contrast , Robertson-Stephens Contrarian is open_to investors with $ 5 # 000 or more ( $ 1 # 000 and up for individual_retirement_accounts ) , and there ' s no 20 % cut on profits . Stephens said the Securities and Exchange Commission would n ' t allow that on mutual_funds . It ' s important to note , however , that Robertson-Stephens Contrarian isn ' t cheap . Management expects that annual operating expenses will run about 2.75 % , about double the norm for stock funds . Although there ' s no front-end sales charge , the expense ratio does include a 0.75 % annual marketing fee . Perhaps the mutual_fund most similar to Robertson-Stephens Contrarian is Dreyfus Capital Value ( Premier ) , a New York-based portfolio that also does short_selling , has been heavily into gold stocks and maintains a modest option weighting . Founded in 1985 , Dreyfus Capital Value ( Premier ) won some acclaim in 1987 , when it returned 34.5 % , compared to an average rise of just 0.5 % for general equity funds . However , it trailed the S &amp; P 500 in four of the next six years and badly lagged in 1991 and 1992 . The $ 445-million portfolio carries a maximum sales charge of 4.5 % . Maybe the most intriguing thing about hedge or contrarian mutual_funds is that there are so few of them . Stephens believes that most fund families see a potential conflict with their existing product_lines . &quot; Most groups don ' t want to introduce a fund that implies the other funds they ' re promoting aren ' t attractive , &quot; he says . &quot; But a year from now , I think there will be many_more like it. &quot; * Chicago-based Acorn International ( ( 800 ) 9-ACORN-9 ) says it will close its doors to new investors effective Feb . 11 , less than two years after it premiered . Existing shareholders will be able to continue adding_to their accounts . Manager Ralph Wanger said the fund ' s management wants to control growth so that its investment focus of buying small foreign stocks isn ' t impaired . The no-load portfolio , which bested most rival international funds in 1993 , has attracted more_than $ 650 million in assets . The sibling Acorn Fund , which invests primarily in small U.S. stocks , has been closed since 1990 . * Liberty Financial Funds of New York has unveiled a quarterly newsletter designed for its shareholders under 18 . &quot; Our research has shown that kids have a strong desire to learn more about investing , &quot; said Kenneth R . Leibler , the company ' s president . The Liberty Financial Advisor for Young Investors will feature_articles and word_games and will include a question-and-answer section . It will also profile companies of interest to younger shareholders , such_as PepsiCo . * The Vanguard Group has unveiled three new index_funds covering the short , intermediate and long ends of the bond market . The no-load portfolios will hold government and corporate_bonds in three maturity ranges : one to five years , five to 10 years and 10 years or more . Vanguard ( ( 800 ) 662-7447 ) says the funds will feature some of the lowest costs around , with anticipated expense ratios of about 0.18 % , or $ 1.80 for each $ 1 # 000 investment . A $ 10 account maintenance fee will be waived for 1994 . * Dalbar Research of Boston says it found that the shareholder statements put_out by mutual_fund groups vary widely , with some being easy to use while others &quot; require an interpreter. &quot; In a study , Dalbar evaluated actual account_statements at 40 fund groups . The company cited four firms for the best presentations -- Putnam Investments of Boston , Invesco Funds of Denver , New York-based Dreyfus Corp . and G.T. Global in San Francisco . Traits associated with user-friendly statements included large type size , explanations of how to read the statements and summaries that prominently show the total value of an investor ' s holdings .</TEXT>
