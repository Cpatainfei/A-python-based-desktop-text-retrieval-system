   <HEADLINE> YOUR MORTGAGE ; SHOULD LENDERS OPT FOR ON-LINE APPRAISALS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s real_estate appraisers want home_buyers and sellers to get involved in a dispute they ' ve just kicked_off with major mortgage lenders : Whether lenders should use electronic_databases on home values as substitutes for traditional appraisals performed by real , live human_beings . The appraisers , not surprisingly , want mortgage companies to keep relying_on them for property valuations needed for the millions of home loans made every year . Lenders , by contrast , say they can increasingly come_up with &quot; alternative &quot; valuations quicker and far cheaper by accessing on-line tax_assessments , multiple listing services , and proprietary resale and appraisal data . So who ' s right ? More to_the_point , should you even care who ' s right ? After all , appraisals exist to serve the lender ' s need for solid collateral to back the mortgage . Why should you care how the lender comes_up with the magic_number ? Well , you should . For starters , you shell_out the money for the appraisal . The bill often comes_to $ 300 , $ 400 or more . Second , the appraisal not only governs the size loan you can get , but could well determine the selling_price of the house itself . Big bucks are involved here . The immediate target of the appraisers ' wrath is a little-publicized but potentially far-reaching organization called the National Property Data Service Work Group ( NPDS ) . The executive committee of NPDS reads like a Who ' s Who of American mortgage finance with representatives of Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Countrywide Funding , GE Capital Mortgage Insurance , Norwest Mortgage Corp. , PMI Mortgage Insurance Co . and Household Mortgage Services . Another 21 large firms are listed as members of the group . The purpose of the organization , according to its own description , is to form a nonprofit , cooperative &quot; single source &quot; of electronic appraisal , real_estate and public records data covering all 50 states . For annual subscription fees , lenders and other participants will be able to tap into a vast data pool of prior appraisals conducted for member lenders , home resale prices , local tax data and other information relevant to making decisions on valuing properties . NPDS is still at the formative stage , having sent_out its first letters to potential database suppliers in late July . The key to the service , say its proponents , will be that most or all_of its data will be available on a real-time basis : With the proper software and codes , participants will have virtually instantaneous access to it through a personal_computer . Rather than waiting for days -- or even weeks -- to get appraisal results , lenders should be able to obtain at least rough valuation numbers in minutes on their laptops . The decrease in time , paperwork and physical effort should save everybody money -- the consumer and the lender . So what ' s wrong with that ? Potentially plenty , says Douglas C . Brown , president of the Appraisal Institute , the industry ' s principal professional trade organization . &quot; If you start limiting the role of the professional who has the expertise to go_out and value properties , &quot; Brown says , &quot; then you ' re going to get_into trouble. &quot; For example , the all-electronic database envisioned by NPDS would n ' t pick_up short-term environmental or market changes that might drastically reduce a property ' s value . Local newspaper readers -- and appraisers -- might know that underground contamination was discovered near a subdivision and threatened to pollute houses ' water_supplies , says Brown , but the computer-derived appraisals would n ' t tell a regional lender about it . Similarly , argues Brown , a homeowner in a tract who had made extensive improvements far beyond the neighborhood norm -- worth tens of thousands of dollars -- might be denied a higher sales price &quot; because the ( NPDS ) machine says , well , the typical house here is worth this amount , and therefore your house is worth the same &quot; for mortgage lending purposes . Brown and other appraisers concede that NPDS worries them in part because it could cut_down sharply on the need for appraisers . &quot; that ' s part of it , &quot; he says , &quot; but the fact is that appraisers add real value to the ( home financing ) process . Consumers and lenders stand to lose that. &quot; Hogwash , say NPDS members . &quot; Appraisers have nothing to fear , &quot; says Lewis J . Allen of GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Co . &quot; This is going_to help them &quot; because much of the information available on-line will be grounded on appraisals contributed by participating lending firms and government_agencies . The efficiency and accuracy of everyone in the business -- appraisers included -- should be improved by pooling huge quantities of currently scattered property appraisal data for quick retrieval and analysis , according to Allen . &quot; The fact is , &quot; said a prominent mortgage executive who asked not to be identified , &quot; that ( traditional ) appraisals now cost too_much and often don ' t tell us a whole_lot that we didn ' t already know . Making buyers pay $ 400 for someone just to validate the purchase_price is a waste , given the data we already can access electronically . &quot; Appraisers , &quot; he said , &quot; are going_to have to join the move to high-tech , or get run_over by it. &quot; Stay tuned .
