   <HEADLINE> CAROLCO PIRATE FILM NAVIGATES FINANCIAL REEFS ; MOVIES : IMPRESARIO MARIO KASSAR HAS RISEN FROM THE ASHES BEFORE , BUT INDUSTRY OBSERVERS WONDER IF HIS TROUBLED ' CUTTHROAT ISLAND ' WILL EVER SEE THE BIG SCREEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bringing &quot; Cutthroat Island &quot; to the big screen may be the toughest feat yet attempted by impresario Mario Kassar , a cinematic Houdini who has made his reputation escaping_from tight spots . On Friday , however , director Renny Harlin and female lead Geena Davis headed to Malta for the Oct . 31 shoot on the assumption that the Carolco Pictures ' chief will , once again , pull it off . Carolco , a high-profile independent production company founded in 1976 by Kassar and his former partner , Andy Vajna , is teetering on the brink of extinction and is badly in need of a massive cash infusion . Trading has been halted since Wednesday after stock plummeted to a 52-week low . Having sunk $ 15 million of its paltry reserves into &quot; Cutthroat &quot; pre-production , Carolco is now negotiating with distribution partner MGM to sell_off Paul Verhoeven ' s soon-to-shoot &quot; Showgirls. &quot; It hopes to raise an additional $ 20 million to keep &quot; Cutthroat &quot; alive . The fate of &quot; Cutthroat , &quot; which is budgeted at $ 75 million , is critical to Carolco both practically and psychologically . &quot; The company will take a big hit if the movie shuts down , &quot; notes one industry_analyst . &quot; Besides , this is the film that tells the Hollywood community Carolco is back. &quot; Carolco declined to comment . According to documents filed by Carolco this week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , the necessary production loans for the pirate adventure are not expected until late this year . The documents stated that unless Carolco can sell the rights to &quot; Showgirls , &quot; finalize the foreign pre-sales contracts crucial to getting the loans , and obtain a completion bond guaranteeing against budget overruns , &quot; Cutthroat Island &quot; has no chance of staying afloat and the company itself could go_under . The movie tells the story of a black-hearted pirate , a dashing gambler and a feisty maiden set_on the 1650s high_seas . Sources close to the film suggest that at least the latter two elements characterize the production itself . Kassar , for starters , is an inveterate gambler . In the early days of Carolco , he and Vajna sold international rights to films before betting big on &quot; First Blood , &quot; the first of the successful &quot; Rambo &quot; trilogy that put the company on the map . Doling out double-digit salaries to A-list talent , they almost single-handedly raised the cost of filmmaking in Hollywood . Still , the payoff was there . Carolco ' s &quot; Terminator 2 &quot; took_in $ 490 million worldwide to become the highest-grossing movie of 1991 . The following year , the company ' s controversial thriller &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; achieved the same distinction , with a $ 353-million worldwide gross . Massive overhead , a penchant for the high life and poor business decisions , however , ultimately took a toll . With the exception of the 1993 hit &quot; Cliffhanger , &quot; the company was in virtual exile for two years until its foreign partners -- Japan ' s Pioneer , France ' s Canal Plus and Credit Lyonnais and Italy ' s RCS -- kicked_in $ 112.5 million last October . That provided , however , only a temporary lease on life . Kassar first approached Michael Douglas about doing &quot; Cutthroat Island &quot; at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival , but the actor turned him down . Later , however , tired_of portraying what he calls &quot; the Prince_of_Darkness &quot; in such films as &quot; Wall_Street &quot; and &quot; Falling Down , &quot; he decided to sign_on . Enter the &quot; feisty maiden &quot; -- Geena Davis -- who was both the female lead and future wife of Renny Harlin . While Douglas was hoping &quot; Cutthroat &quot; would be a cross between &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark &quot; and &quot; Romancing the Stone , &quot; Davis was reportedly envisioning a female pirate movie along the lines of &quot; Mistress of the Seas &quot; -- in which she was to have starred until Columbia pulled the plug last year . * Sources say Davis ' ongoing push for more screen time -- not to mention the fact she was married to the director -- created a no-win situation for Douglas , who dropped_out in June . &quot; Geena is very smart and opinionated -- known for delivering voluminous notes on a script , &quot; says a producer . &quot; Harlin is stubborn and headstrong . That doesn ' t leave much room for an actor. &quot; Not so , Douglas insists . Though Davis ( who is said to be getting upward of $ 5 million for the role ) partly drew_on her characterization in &quot; Mistress of the Seas , &quot; she never tried to make the movie her own , he says . And Harlin , aware of the complexities of directing his wife , reassured Douglas he ' d make him comfortable and secure . &quot; The balance between the male and female parts never changed , &quot; says Douglas . &quot; It just took longer to develop my character . I have no problem with strong female protagonists . . . they ' re present in most of my films . The issue was that there was only a week or so between wrapping ( Barry Levinson ' s ) ' Disclosure , ' in which I appear in every scene , and the start of the ' Cutthroat ' shoot . I did ' War of the Roses ' six days after ' Black Rain ' and really got burned. &quot; Actors ranging from Daniel Day-Lewis to Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes turned the part down before Matthew Modine ( &quot; And the Band Played On &quot; ) came aboard . Though the actor ' s $ 1.5-million salary -- considerably less than the $ 12 million Douglas was to have commanded -- helped the bottom_line , industry_analysts suggest that casting him makes foreign sales more difficult . International distributors who initially picked_up the movie on the basis of Douglas ' name are now being offered an actor who ' s virtually unknown overseas . And no Geena Davis film has taken_off abroad . &quot; They ' re banking on the fact that small stars become big stars -- sometimes overnight , &quot; says one executive , referring to Modine . &quot; Look_at Keanu Reeves in ' Speed. ' &quot; * The big question is whether the loans will come_in soon enough -- and be sizable enough -- to carry a film this big . Especially since Harlin -- in the face of complicated special_effects and uncooperative weather -- went $ 23 million over budget on &quot; Die Hard 2. &quot; A line producer on &quot; Cutthroat &quot; has already been fired and sources say that Harlin -- as a producer as well as the director -- may be hard to rein_in . The newly revived MGM is taking a wait-and-see approach , hoping the film will be a &quot; tent pole &quot; around which next summer ' s slate can be built . A source insists that the studio put_up a percentage of &quot; Cutthroat ' s &quot; production budget , but others close to MGM say its sole commitment is to advertising and prints . Skeptics -- and there are many -- doubt that &quot; Cutthroat &quot; will be made . No completion bond company , they say , will insure against budgetary overage on a project tainted with an &quot; air of trouble. &quot; And it remains to be seen how long the equity partners will hang_in . &quot; Kassar has held a house of cards together that a gust of wind should have blown apart , &quot; says entertainment lawyer David Colden . &quot; But , it ' s been 18 months since Carolco ' s last blockbuster and the company ' s overhead is sky high . Their partners may just say , ' Enough of this bloodletting. ' &quot; Still , Kassar ' s defenders caution not to count the man out . A consummate showman with an insatiable appetite for risk as well as excess , Kassar has risen from the ashes time and again . &quot; When someone like Mario takes chances and gets_into trouble , the Establishment takes pot-shots , &quot; Douglas observes . &quot; But independent producers are an endangered species . It ' s not in the interest of the industry to lose them. &quot;</TEXT>
