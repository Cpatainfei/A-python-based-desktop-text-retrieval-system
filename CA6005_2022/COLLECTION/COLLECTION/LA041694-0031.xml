   <HEADLINE> SUSPECTED HAMAS ACTIVISTS DETAINED ; ISRAEL : CRACKDOWN TARGETS RADICAL PALESTINIAN FACTION THAT HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR TWO RECENT SUICIDE BOMBINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a campaign to neutralize the Islamic fundamentalist threat in Israel , authorities have arrested dozens of suspected activists of the radical Palestinian faction Hamas in a continuing sweep of the occupied territories . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin also demanded that neighboring Jordan crack_down on Hamas , which has claimed responsibility for killing 12 Israelis in two suicide bombings on buses in the last week . But Jordan on Friday rejected Israel ' s request to close the group ' s office in Amman . Rabin asserted in unusually harsh language that Hamas was using its headquarters in the Jordanian capital for logistic_support to armed activists in the Israeli-occupied territories , as well as a propaganda tool . He said Israel &quot; very gravely &quot; views what he called Amman ' s role as &quot; a paradise for Hamas activity. &quot; But a Jordanian official called Rabin ' s statement &quot; rash , baseless and not conducive to the peace process. &quot; Rabin refused to rule_out military_action to stop Hamas activities in Jordan , a nation that borders the Israeli-occupied West_Bank . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , a key mover behind Israel ' s peace process with Jordan who joined Rabin in the hastily arranged Thursday night news_conference , attempted a more diplomatic line . &quot; The call was made not out of ridicule for Jordan and its relations with Israel , &quot; Peres said . &quot; But there is not one instance in foreign relations in which a country that is striving for peace will allow_in broad daylight a representative of a murderous organization to appear and say his organization carried_out the murder and that they intend to carry_out three more. &quot; In leaflets , Hamas on Friday repeated its vow to continue attacks against Israel . Mohammed Nazzal , the group ' s spokesman in Jordan , also took responsibility on behalf of Hamas for a suicide bombing Wednesday in the northern Israeli town of Hadera and a similar attack in the Israeli town of Afula about 35 miles to the north . The Islamic group called_on all Arabs to avoid traveling on Israeli buses and &quot; to stay_away_from places where many Israelis gather &quot; in coming days &quot; so they will not be hit in our upcoming operations. &quot; Arab women who lived_in Israel were killed in each of the two suicide bombings . At the same time Rabin and Peres were confronting Jordan -- which Rabin said had ignored Jerusalem ' s private requests for action for 10 days -- Israeli army and intelligence units were moving to arrest suspected Hamas members in raids from the Gaza Strip to the northern West_Bank villages where the suicide bombers lived . At least four youths were arrested Friday in Yabad , the sleepy mountainside village that was the home of Ammar Amarneh . He blew himself up along with five Israelis on a packed commuter bus in Hadera , Israeli authorities say . More_than a dozen other suspects were picked_up in the nearby village of Kabatiya , which was home to Ra ' ed Zakarneh , who , Israeli authorities say , drove a car packed with 350 pounds of explosives , propane tanks and nails into a commuter bus as it picked_up children in Afula on April 6 . In all , Palestinian sources said Israeli authorities arrested more_than 70 suspected Hamas activists in the last several days -- more_than half in Gaza and the remainder from the West_Bank , particularly in the occupied villages closest to sovereign Israel . Both Israeli towns where the suicide bombings took_place are near those West_Bank villages , across the &quot; Green Line &quot; separating sovereign Israel from the territories . Both Palestinian villages are near the Jordanian border to the east . Besides the several dozen suspected Hamas members arrested in the villages of the northern West_Bank , the Israeli army has also detained without explanation Mohammed Abdullah Nassar , Ra ' ed Zakarneh ' s father . He has said in several recent interviews that he is a taxi driver with no political affiliation . The arrests came_after Israeli negotiators -- who are attempting to complete an agreement on implementing a peace plan for Palestinian autonomy , beginning in Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho -- said this week that they would never agree to Palestine Liberation Organization demands that Israel release Hamas prisoners , along with those from other Palestinian factions . The PLO will attempt to govern all Palestinians when it assumes self-rule under a final agreement , which negotiators will again begin discussing in Cairo on Sunday . Meantime , diplomatic efforts were under way late Friday to defuse growing tension between Israel and Lebanon after rocket attacks on northern Israel by the Islamic group Hezbollah , based in southern Lebanon . No one was injured in the rocket barrage , which came_after the South Lebanon Army , Israel ' s surrogate in its 440-square-mile &quot; security zone , &quot; shelled the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon . The artillery attack was in apparent retaliation for a Hezbollah roadside bombing that left three SLA soldiers dead and five more injured earlier in the day . Most residents of northern Israeli villages spent the day in bomb_shelters for the first time since a fierce exchange of rockets , artillery and air strikes eight months ago that Israel dubbed Operation Accountability .</TEXT>
