   <HEADLINE> TRAGEDY ' S FINAL CHAPTER IS A LIFE SENTENCE ; MURDER : KILLER OF ESTRANGED WIFE AND HER LOVER IS SENTENCED DURING AN EMOTIONAL COURTROOM SCENE IN WHICH SOME SPECTATORS CHEERED AND OTHERS WEPT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Huntington Beach man was sentenced Friday to life in prison without parole for murdering his estranged wife and her lover in a case that has devastated three families and stripped a child of her parents . During an emotional sentencing hearing attended by more_than 40 friends and relatives of the victims , many wept and some even cheered when Gary Beaudoin , 32 , was given the maximum prison sentence for the Sept . 10 , 1992 , murders of Patricia Beaudoin , 22 , and Mark Forshee , 23 , also of Huntington Beach . Several family members spoke during the court session , recalling how the murders have forever changed their lives . Mattheson Smith of Huntington Beach , the slain woman ' s father , also voiced his grief and guilt . &quot; I believe fathers feel they should be there to protect their families , their daughters , &quot; Smith told the judge , struggling to keep his voice steady . &quot; Now I have to live with the guilt of not being there when she needed me most. &quot; At the time of the murders , Gary and Patricia Beaudoin were the parents of a toddler , Kayla , but were in the process of separating and heading toward divorce . Prosecutors depicted the murders as a cold-blooded attack by a man who refused to let_go . Defense_attorneys , however , said Gary Beaudoin was driven by despair and rage when he discovered his wife was cheating on him . The trial became an intimate portrait of a crumbling marriage , and proved to be emotionally draining for jurors , many of whom were moved to tears during their weeklong deliberations and even while their verdicts were being read last December . On Friday , the Beaudoin , Smith and Forshee families were left struggling to get past their losses . Kayla , 2 , is being raised by her mother ' s family and is still too young to understand it all , Smith said . Susan Forshee , the sister of the victim , told the court that she lost her best_friend when her brother was murdered . &quot; Nothing means anything to us anymore , &quot; she said through her tears . On the night of the murders , Gary Beaudoin was returning home when he saw his wife and Forshee moving_out her belongings . He began following the pair . When Forshee pulled over at Bolsa Chica Street in Huntington Beach , Gary Beaudoin approached the truck , carrying a gun . Deputy Dist . Atty . Christopher J . Evans told jurors that Patricia Beaudoin and Forshee were shot in the head and upper body , and probably never knew what hit them . But Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia told jurors that Gary Beaudoin fired in rage when Forshee laughed in his face . Many relatives said Friday they feel Beaudoin has tried to blame the victims . But defense_attorney Jack M . Earley , who represented Beaudoin at his sentencing , said that was never his client ' s intent . &quot; He is not saying these are bad or evil people who deserved to die , &quot; Earley said during the hearing . He later read from a statement written by Beaudoin . &quot; Unfortunately , there is no remorse or words to change the results of my actions , &quot; his statement read . &quot; I loved my wife and daughter very much and the possibility of losing both of them was emotionally devastating. &quot; Jerry Beaudoin , Gary ' s father , was hoping for a lenient sentence . &quot; But no matter what the sentence , no one comes_out a winner here at all , &quot; Jerry Beaudoin said outside court , shaking his head . &quot; This case is sad for everyone , all around. &quot;</TEXT>
