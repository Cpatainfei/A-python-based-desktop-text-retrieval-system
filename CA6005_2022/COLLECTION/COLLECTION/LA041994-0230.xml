   <TEXT> When Peter Jacobs enrolled at the University of the Western Cape a decade ago as a prospective teacher , he was already deep into the struggle against apartheid -- deeper than even he realized . Jacobs , now 28 , had helped organize the Cape Youth Congress and the local branch of the radical Congress of South_African Students ; he was reading smuggled material from the outlawed African National Congress and South_African Communist_Party , and he was in touch with underground members of the ANC and its military wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe ( Spear of the Nation ) . &quot; I was hyperactive , &quot; Jacobs said , recalling the tide of campaigns then being waged by Colored youths against the minority white regime in Cape_Town . &quot; I was involved in everything from the boycott of the Colored elections for Parliament to local strikes to the rally for Sen . ( Edward M. ) Kennedy . When I was approached to join the underground myself , it made_sense politically . &quot; There is a point at which you can ' t go any further , when organizing demonstrations and rallies does not make_sense when the regime is shooting people and detaining activists and attacking from all sides . that ' s when you want to do more -- when you want to pick_up a gun and shoot back. &quot; Jacobs became the political_commissar of an ANC guerrilla unit in Mitchell ' s Plain , the sprawling Colored town on the Cape Peninsula , recruiting other activists and planning a series of minor attacks -- a grenade attack on a policeman ' s home , bombs in police_stations and magistrate ' s courts , demolition of towers for electrical lines -- meant to show the ANC ' s presence there . &quot; Peter had grown_up angry , &quot; his mother , Patricia , recalled . &quot; He had been tear-gassed a lot as a small boy and chased by police . He knew how the government had taken_away my parents ' home and given it to whites . He had seen how we were moved here -- when there were no schools , no parks , nothing to make this place livable . &quot; But I was still surprised -- shocked really -- when police raided the house and said Peter was a member of the ANC . We had argued a lot about politics , almost every day in fact , and the question was not whether to change things , but how . I told him apartheid was like a weed and that breaking_off leaves one by one was not enough -- that its roots had to be pulled out. &quot; Just a_few steps ahead of the security police , Peter Jacobs fled the country , missing his sister ' s wedding . Making his way to Mozambique , Jacobs formally joined Umkhonto we Sizwe . &quot; We got a lot of training on urban_guerrilla tactics , improvising weapons and operating underground , &quot; he said . &quot; We came_back with instructions to lead the campaign to make the country ungovernable and to push it toward a full insurrection. &quot; He was arrested six months later , in May , 1987 , while waiting for one of his underground contacts , and held under emergency regulations . Seven months after that , he was charged with terrorism along with 20 other members of the ANC and , after a yearlong trial , was sentenced to 14 years on Robben Island , South_Africa ' s notorious penal colony off Cape_Town . With his initial detention began the amazing radicalization of Patricia Jacobs , now 66 , who had just retired after working 19 years in Cape_Town clothing factories . &quot; I had always tried to look_at things from a Christian point_of_view , &quot; she said . &quot; I believed that reforms would come , I was against violence , I thought the law was wrong but could be changed , I thought the ANC was too radical . . . . As I sat in court day after day , I came_to understand what motivated them . To me , it became absolutely clear that it was right to resist. &quot; * To the surprise of her family and friends , Patricia -- still a Sunday_school teacher in the conservative Colored branch of the Dutch Reformed Church -- became a leader in parents ' protests over the imprisonment of their sons and daughters . The struggle had been under way , handed from one generation to the next , virtually since European settlers pushed inland from the Cape_of_Good_Hope in the 17th Century . In the Cape , the Dutch , German and French Huguenot settlers -- who became Africa ' s &quot; white tribe , &quot; the Afrikaners -- and later the_English came_into conflict with the indigenous San ( or &quot; Bushmen &quot; ) and Khoikhoi ( &quot; Hottentots &quot; ) peoples and farther north with Bantu-speaking Africans who had moved south from Central_Africa into regions now known as Transvaal , the Orange Free_State , Natal and the Eastern Cape . After the_British captured the Cape Colony from the Dutch , they fought a series of border wars with the Xhosas from 1811 to 1878 as settlers expanded their holdings and the Africans resisted . The Afrikaners , rejecting British rule and trekking farther inland , fought the Zulus , defeating them in 1838 . Forty years later , the Zulus defeated the_British in one epic battle , but they were then crushed and Zululand was annexed . In 1913 , three years after the Union of South_Africa was established after the Anglo-Boer War , the white Parliament limited Africans , then 70 % of the population , to land in tribal reserves equal_to 7 % of the country ' s territory ; later , the reserves were increased to 13.7 % . For South_Africans , both blacks_and_whites , the fundamental question thus has long been : Whose land is this ? Under apartheid , the white regime asserted that modern South_Africa really belonged_to those , first of all_the Afrikaners , who had developed it , and it insisted that most black_Africans should &quot; return &quot; to tribal homelands , such places as Transkei , Bophuthatswana , Quaqua or KwaZulu , and develop those areas . For blacks , the repeated seizure of their land over the centuries was the crucial issue , for without the land not only were they reduced to penury , but their society , culture and political_system were threatened with extinction . * Sentiment remains strong among many blacks , particularly supporters of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania , that until the land is reclaimed and an African government installed in power , black grievances cannot be redressed . The African National Congress , though founded in 1912 to represent the African majority and battle racial discrimination , came_to the view in its 1955 Freedom Charter that &quot; South_Africa belongs_to all who live_in it , black_and_white &quot; and that &quot; our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live_in brotherhood , enjoying equal rights and opportunities. &quot; &quot; The turning point in our struggle came_in 1949 -- that ' s right , 1949 , &quot; ANC Deputy President Walter Sisulu , 82 , said , reflecting on the long battle against apartheid . &quot; That is when the ANC adopted its action program , and my generation -- Nelson Mandela , Oliver Tambo and others -- dedicated ourselves not just to ending apartheid but to achieving democracy for South_Africa . . . . &quot; We had a long tradition of nonviolence in the ANC , but the regime was so stubborn that in time -- we waited until 1961 -- we had to take_up arms . There was no other way forward . We had to believe that we could compel the regime by force of arms to change , but we always hoped that the solution would come_through negotiations . We thought this was a sober policy . Today , we feel vindicated. &quot; Convicted of sabotage and preparing_for guerrilla warfare , Sisulu was sent to prison for life in 1964 with Mandela and other ANC leaders , and the ANC faded into exile , first in London and then in Lusaka , Zambia . Although they trained younger_men to carry_on the struggle , the ANC had been badly hurt . &quot; We needed time to regroup , reorganize and restructure ourselves , &quot; said Max Sisulu , 48 , eldest of the five Sisulu children , who was freed from detention and ordered out of the country by the ANC while his father was_on trial . &quot; We needed time to recover and to develop a long-term strategy . This was not going_to be won quickly or easily . It was going_to take another generation -- at least. &quot; * Ellen Molekane still remembers that Saturday night date 17 years ago when her boyfriend , Mandla Msibi , a Baptist minister advising her youth group in Soweto , stopped his car in a secluded spot , got_out , opened the trunk and invited her to have_a_look . &quot; There were two brand-new AK-47s , absolutely glistening and very , very beautiful , &quot; she recalled . &quot; That was the first time I had seen anything like these rifles . They were exquisite . I knew then that I was in the right movement . I was convinced that we could defeat the Boers. &quot; Working with &quot; Black_Man , &quot; as the legendary Msibi was known in the ANC underground , Molekane helped establish arms caches around Johannesburg and then took_part in ANC operations , including the assassination in Durban of a defector from the ANC ' s military wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , and the shooting of another police informer within the movement , also in Durban . &quot; Some were really quite sensational military_actions , and they helped put the ANC back on the political scene , &quot; she recalled . &quot; To defeat apartheid , we had to convince both the regime and our own people that we could and would fight . We had to overcome our sense of powerlessness and total vulnerability and their sense of omnipotence and impunity. &quot; With the police closing in , Molekane and Msibi moved to neighboring Swaziland , then to Mozambique and Tanzania , where their son , Tumi , was born in 1979 . When Msibi died in 1980 in Swaziland , it was believed that he had suffered a heart_attack . Evidence from government files now suggests that he was poisoned by South_African agents . * Ellen Molekane , who is 40 and a senior ANC finance official today , was trained in military engineering in East_Germany , the German Democratic Republic , served in a series of front-line and staff positions in Umkhonto we Sizwe and later became secretary of the ANC ' s key political-military committee in Lusaka , Zambia , before returning to South_Africa after the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990 . &quot; Life is what leads you into these situations , &quot; she said . &quot; I wanted to become a nurse or maybe an accountant , but instead I became a soldier . I have asked myself why , and the answer I keep coming_up with was that it was the only way . When I was young , I believed_in education , in virtue , in the goodness of people -- all those things my mother and father believed_in . &quot; When I got a bit older , I saw that believing was not enough -- we had to act ourselves . But what sort of actions ? At first , we thought that , if the whole ( black ) nation raised its political consciousness and united and stood_up against the oppression , this would bring apartheid to an end . When we tried , we found that it was not enough simply to demand freedom and justice . This had to be fought for and won . It has been a very hard struggle , a struggle of a lifetime. &quot; The second of seven Molekane children , Ellen Molekane readily admits that she grew_up angry -- angry at &quot; The System , &quot; angry at whites for creating it , angry at blacks for accepting it with a seeming inability to resist . &quot; I looked_at the older generation , not so_much my parents but the generation as_a_whole , and thought : ' What a mess you have left us ! How could you just accept what these whites dictated ? Why didn ' t you fight ? Why didn ' t you struggle to win_back our country ? ' &quot; she recalled , still feisty . &quot; Oh , I was a very angry young_lady ! Our generation , my friends and I decided , would be the one that ended this apartheid. &quot; While she was at Soweto ' s Morris Isaacson Comprehensive Secondary_School , long a center of political activism , Molekane had joined the South_African Students ' Movement , many of whose members went_on to lead other anti-apartheid groups in later years , but she found its Black Consciousness ideology &quot; a long , dark tunnel that led nowhere. &quot; &quot; This was the era of the Cultural Revolution in China , and we all had little Mao Tse-tung books that we read aloud to one another , &quot; Molekane reminisced , her eyes twinkling with humor . &quot; And then we had this very funny ' black is beautiful ' stuff from America . . . . &quot; But our protests , however big and bold we thought they were , would never have done_it . It took time to realize that the apartheid regime was not going_to crumble like the walls of Jericho simply because we marched in the streets and shouted , ' Down with apartheid ! ' &quot; Watching his sister become involved in politics was a younger brother , Rapu , who listened to the older students ' debates in the small Molekane house in Soweto ' s Jabavu neighborhood and watched as they planned their protests . &quot; The landmark for me was June 16 , 1976 , and the uprising against Afrikaans as the language we were being taught in , &quot; Rapu Molekane said , recalling student protests that swelled into the first major challenge to apartheid in 15 years . &quot; I was only in primary_school , but I knew something big was going_to happen when I saw my sisters ' friends making banners out of mealie ( cornmeal ) sacks in the back yard and heard them planning their march . * &quot; We younger kids -- I was 15 or 16 -- went_to school to start our midyear exams that day , but we were summoned from there by older students to a meeting protesting Afrikaans . We tore_up our exams right there in the classroom and marched out. &quot; For Rapu , who is now 33 , it was his first_step into what is known among blacks as simply &quot; The Struggle. &quot; &quot; Living_in Soweto is what makes people like my family go_into politics , &quot; Rapu Molekane said . &quot; You keep asking questions about why you ' re nine or 10 or 12 people in a tiny , four-roomed house with outdoor plumbing , about why you have to go_to school without shoes , about why the white bosses are working your mother and father to death . . . . We weren ' t born radicals -- life made us this way. &quot; Rapu Molekane joined the Congress of South_African Students , got training in organizational methods from a Catholic-run group , Young Christian Students , and used it to help found the Soweto Youth Congress and later the South_African Youth Congress , becoming its secretary_general . Repeatedly arrested , frequently tortured and detained without charge under emergency regulations for months at a time , Rapu Molekane helped organize the United Democratic Front , the main anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s , and then joined the ANC ' s political underground . Released from detention in 1989 , he slipped out of the country and , infuriating the government , flew to New York to address a United Nations committee on political_prisoners . &quot; We did a lot of our planning in prison , &quot; he recounted . &quot; We took Robben Island ( where top ANC leaders had been jailed since 1964 ) as our model , and we debated and strategized and planned one campaign after another right there in our cells . We were actually expecting the government to put us all_in concentration_camps in the desert . &quot; Through the various states of emergency in the 1980s , the government was detaining more and more people , but that enabled us to get new information , send_out new directives and think ahead to the next step . We recruited the prison warders and had all sorts of political materials smuggled in to us. &quot; At the ANC ' s headquarters in Lusaka , Ellen Molekane read of her brother ' s activities , and later they met for the first time in a decade when he came_to confer_with ANC leaders . &quot; From 1983 , I started picking_up Rapu ' s name in intelligence reports , but when I got_to know how deeply he was involved it was really bad news , &quot; she said . &quot; I thought it was OK for him to be an activist , but the underground work could make things worse for the family . Still , I was proud -- my little_brother doing such big things. &quot; * Rapu Molekane was indeed a key figure in the mobilization of millions of black youths as the shock force in the ANC ' s campaign to make South_Africa ungovernable . &quot; We were aiming at building the protests into an insurrection and turning that into an armed rebellion and then a seizure of power , &quot; he recalled . &quot; That strategy may look naive today , totally unrealistic and a failure , but we developed a momentum that shattered the regime ' s self-confidence and diminished its ability to maintain apartheid . In the end , it was forced into negotiations. &quot; As most of the Molekane family gathered for lunch this Easter -- with Ellen taking_charge of the sausage , the salads , the squash , the rice with peas and a dessert of ice_cream , custard and fruit_cocktail -- there was satisfaction that the toughest part of the struggle was over , both for the country and the family . Although worn down by his years of work in a Johannesburg furniture factory , Stephen Molekane surveyed the array of children and grandchildren , who now number 16 , and smiled with tears in the corners of his eyes . &quot; What a pleasure this family is , &quot; he said . &quot; Life has been hard , but this family is a wonder. &quot; That pride is evident in the pictures of Rapu Molekane with ANC President Nelson Mandela and his predecessor , Oliver R . Tambo , hanging_on the living-room wall . When Mandela was released , Rapu worked as his personal assistant . When the ANC Youth League was re-established inside South_Africa , he was elected its secretary_general , a post held by Mandela himself four decades earlier . And , to complete the reversal of fortunes , Rapu Molekane is now an ANC candidate for Parliament and assured of a seat by his rank on the ticket . Sitting on a favorite bench in the shade of the house , Stephen Molekane , who retired five years ago , spoke quietly of the effort required to raise his family through the years of apartheid . &quot; We first thought apartheid would not last so_long , &quot; he said , recalling the hopes he and his wife , Mary , who died in 1991 , had when they first moved to Johannesburg in the late 1940s . &quot; We thought the Boers ( the Afrikaners ) would see that this foolishness would not work and would give it up , but they didn ' t . &quot; Then we hoped that , at least , if our children got an education then they would get_ahead despite The System , but that was not possible . When Ellen went_into exile , it hurt , it really hurt , and when Rapu got involved in politics , Mary and I were afraid for his life . Now , I must say these children were right -- that apartheid had to be battled . But we were lucky , very lucky they came_through it all alive. &quot; * Thousands did die -- more_than 20 # 000 have been killed in political conflict in South_Africa over the last decade -- for as blacks pressed forward , demanding an end to apartheid , whites tightened their grip on power . &quot; Above anything else , apartheid was an instrument of political and economic power , and no regime yields power willingly , &quot; said Zwelakhe Sisulu , 43 , the third of Walter Sisulu ' s five children and a major figure in his own_right . &quot; This regime was more determined than most , even to_the_point of great brutality , to preserve its position. &quot; Reluctantly , the National Party did retreat in the 1980s from the strictures of &quot; petty apartheid &quot; -- the racial_segregation that kept whites and blacks separate in restaurants and hotels , on buses and trains , in schools and sports -- in the hope of satisfying black demands . Later , the government responded to requests of businessmen to liberalize other laws in the name of economic stability and increased efficiency . Blacks would be satisfied , it was believed , with material rather than political concessions -- better housing , education and job opportunities . President Pieter W . Botha went_further , backing_away from &quot; grand apartheid &quot; to bring Indians and Coloreds into his government in 1984 , and then to accept a permanent but still limited presence of Africans in urban_areas . Most Afrikaners had already moved beyond the embarrassingly crude racial concepts of the original apartheid and supported the changes . Apartheid had proved unworkable , many believed , and some sort of &quot; power-sharing &quot; with blacks would come_in time . But more conservative whites , feeling betrayed , began leaving the National Party for the far right . * Botha had substituted &quot; security &quot; for apartheid as the dominant political theme to mobilize the whites . Increasingly , he relied_upon the country ' s vast security Establishment -- the military , the security police , the intelligence service -- and pursued a &quot; total strategy &quot; to meet what he saw as a &quot; total onslaught &quot; directed against South_Africa from the Soviet_Union . &quot; The essential flaw in their strategy was that we were not directed from Moscow -- this was a true liberation struggle , not a revolutionary war , &quot; said Zwelakhe Sisulu , who was repeatedly detained during the 1980s for his political activities but never charged . &quot; Nothing happened at the snap of some Soviet commissar ' s fingers . Everything we did was_on the base of what we had done before. &quot; The turning point for Zwelakhe Sisulu , founding editor of the weekly newspaper New Nation and now a top_executive of the South_African Broadcasting Corp. , came_with the emergence of the United Democratic Front , the Congress of South_African Trade_Unions and other groups that focused not on ending apartheid but replacing it with democracy . &quot; It took years for the people to realize they had to engage in mass struggle against the regime and to gain the confidence to do so , &quot; he commented . &quot; But when they did , they found the government couldn ' t crush it . &quot; The next step was to move from ungovernability , which meant that the state was not in control but neither were we , to the establishment of democratic structures of our own. &quot;</TEXT>
