   <HEADLINE> HE ' S A RAD SCIENTIST ; WINNING THE NOBEL WON ' T CHANGE USC ' S NEW LAUREATE . HE PROUDLY SAYS HE ' LL CONTINUE TO BE THE GOOD CHEMIST HE WAS BEFORE HE WON FAME AND $ 935 # 000 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are times when George A . Olah -- USC ' s new Nobel laureate -- suspects that anyone who really wants to understand him needs an advanced degree in chemistry . That may explain why , one day in 1950 , he came_home and announced to his new wife that he had enrolled her as a chemistry major . He did not think to ask her first whether she was actually interested in the bonds that hold the material world together . And it did not occur to her to refuse . It was an unexpected experiment in the chemistry of marriage . &quot; Believe me , it was the biggest shock of my life , &quot; says Judith Olah . &quot; He came_home radiant . ' I enrolled you , ' he said . ' In chemistry. ' Without asking me . I had absolutely no intention , let me assure you , ever of studying chemistry in my life. &quot; Nonetheless , she earned undergraduate and then graduate degrees in chemistry . She spent 40 years working in her husband ' s laboratory , retiring three years ago as an adjunct professor of chemistry at USC . &quot; Can I defend myself ? &quot; the imperturbable Hungarian-born researcher asks_in his accented rumble like distant thunder . &quot; The life of a scientist is not a very easy life , &quot; he begins . &quot; Once you are hooked on science , it takes_up so_much time . I am not complaining . I am doing this with joy . It is not just what you do_in the lab or with students . It is thinking and writing and so on . . . a hell of a lot of time . &quot; An essential part of any happy marriage , &quot; he continues , &quot; should be some understanding and balance . I think if somebody doesn ' t understand what the other partner is doing , this can cause real difficulty . Our happy marriage , I attribute in part to the fact she started to understand what this is all about . &quot; So , &quot; Olah says , &quot; she became a chemist. &quot; They enjoy the moment of silence . &quot; I think that is the smartest thing he did , &quot; she says . * Only on the most pristine days can George and Judith Olah see all_the way from their patio at the lip of Coldwater Canyon to the Pacific_Ocean . Most of the time the view is obscured by the curtain of smog common in most American cities held captive by the automobile . In one way or another , the distinguished USC chemist has been trying to clear the air all his life . To the average person , the most noticeable benefits of his scientific insights are lead-free gasoline , cleaner high-octane gas and the promise of other non-polluting fuels that might one day reduce the burden of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere . But those are only a_few spinoffs from Olah ' s exploration of chemical_reactions involving hydrocarbons -- fundamental building_blocks of life -- which has revamped basic research in biomedicine and industrial chemistry . To his peers in the world of advanced chemistry , Olah ' s work unlocked an entire world of previously elusive reactions and unexpected chemical structures . In the research that most impressed the Nobel Prize committee , Olah showed a way to capture and stabilize a class of unusual chemical_compounds so fleeting that their lifetimes can be measured in millionths of a second . And he created a new class of powerfully corrosive acids to stabilize them long enough to study in detail . Colleagues said his breakthrough was the fruit of a characteristic leap of imagination . &quot; He really does march to a different drummer , &quot; says Stanford_University chemistry professor John I . Brauman . &quot; He doesn ' t buy_into the conventional wisdom . That is what makes his stuff so important . It really is different and , it turns_out , amazingly interesting . &quot; He could actually make new reactions happen that you couldn ' t get before , &quot; Brauman says . For several years , USC officials and Olah ' s colleagues at other schools have been calling his work &quot; Nobel-class. &quot; When he was persuaded to move from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland to USC in 1977 , he had already been elected to the National Academy of Sciences . Nonetheless , the telephone_call that announced his 1994 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was a shock when it actually arrived Oct . 12 at 6:30 a.m. Messages from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , which makes the Nobel Prize selections , are not a normal part of Olah ' s early-morning routine that begins at dawn with a half-hour of laps in the swimming_pool , followed by yogurt , an English_muffin and a 12-hour workday . The prize -- and the $ 935 # 000 cash award that accompanies it -- brings with it almost instant international recognition . So far , Olah is taking the attention in stride . &quot; I take my science exceedingly seriously . It is my life . But I try to keep myself in proportion , &quot; he says . &quot; I don ' t believe_in stuffy scientists who get the feeling because they got a prize that all at once they are exceptional people . As much as I appreciate it , I thought I was a pretty good chemist a week ago and a month ago. &quot; At 67 , he has reached a point in life when many people have retired , but he still actively pursues his research projects , teaching responsibilities and the day-to-day direction of the Loker Hydrocarbon Institute at USC . The most serious chemistry he has done lately , however , is to spike a glass of morning orange_juice with celebratory champagne . * These are the human facts of the Olah equation : He was born in 1927 in Budapest amid the faded glory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . He was a child during the Great Depression , a teen-ager during the Nazi occupation of Hungary . He turned 18 the year World_War_II ended and finished his Ph.D. four years later . He married Judith in 1949 , fathered the first of two sons , and , in the years of Soviet dominance of Hungary started the experiments that would eventually garner him the 1994 Nobel Prize . Then , in the year the Soviet_Union sent tanks into Budapest to crush a rebellion , Olah fled with his family to London , then to Canada and finally to the United States . &quot; We survived a long while between East and West , &quot; he says . &quot; Then I had a chance to restart my life. &quot; Today , in their comfortable living room , where original lithographs by Picasso and Chagall grace the flagstone mantle and chemistry texts compete for shelf space with tomes on Dali and Renoir , Olah and his wife are not inclined to reminisce about hardship or privation . Even in repose , Olah is imposing , so tall -- 6 feet , 5 inches -- that to sit comfortably in an armchair he must fold himself up like a jackknife , crossing his legs one over the other and tucking his foot behind one ankle . If pressed , Olah acknowledges , yes , there was &quot; a darker political side &quot; to life in Hungary . Yes , he grudgingly admits , there were weeks of combat for control of Budapest . Yes , he arrived in the West &quot; with the shirt on his back. &quot; His wife recalls , &quot; he was a young guy from nowhere. &quot; But other subjects quickly intrude -- their collection of Eskimo sculpture and the provenance of their lithograph of Picasso ' s &quot; California. &quot; It is for friends and colleagues to pass along the stories of Olah trying to survive in war-torn Hungary , doling out a gold chain , one link at a time , to buy the potatoes and soybeans that kept his family alive . * &quot; Nobody in my family ever had any interest in science , &quot; Olah says . His father was a lawyer . His mother kept house . Only after high_school was Olah ' s interest in medieval history and Latin classics preempted by chemistry . Not even Olah can say easily what compels him to invest so_much of his life and energy in an investigation of what makes matter hang_together . &quot; I do what I do because I have great curiosity . Creative science , I think , has close relations_to art . It is a creative intellectual process , &quot; Olah says . In Hungary , as in most European_countries of the period , a promising student apprenticed with a professor . The mentor collected a handsome fee for the privilege . Olah earned his keep instead . &quot; I was privileged that I wasn ' t paying my professor . I was his private assistant and was privileged to work seven days a week , &quot; he says dryly . &quot; Even then I had my own ideas , and that did not sit well with my professor. &quot; The idea of earning his keep underpins his attitude toward research today . First as an industrial chemist and then as a university-based researcher , Olah has been anxious to see his discoveries put into practical_application or published openly where other chemists could benefit from the work . He has taken_out more_than 100 patents and published more_than 950 research papers . &quot; He believes that any work you start is incomplete until it is peer-reviewed and published , &quot; says Surya Prakash , Olah ' s longtime research collaborator at USC . Olah recalls being irritated by the attitude of his research_director at Dow Chemical Co. , where he worked when he first came_to the United States . &quot; His philosophy was that they could afford this fundamental research but I shouldn ' t bother them too_much with the results . I thought , maybe naively , that they were paying me a good salary and I have some obligation to do something , &quot; Olah says . * Not unexpectedly , Olah has strong ideas on the pursuit of scientific truth . He is unyielding on the principle that a scientist must submit himself to the discipline of what can be measured , observed and openly proven . &quot; Scientists are there to find_out what is there in nature . It is not like politics or economics or many other things , &quot; he says . &quot; In many ways , we have no control about what is there . If nature created a certain molecule or a certain compound , you can ' t change that fact. &quot; Over the years , Olah has demonstrated he sometimes sees those facts differently than other scientists -- often more clearly . &quot; I take_pride that my colleagues think I have a rather distinctive individual approach to chemistry , &quot; he says . But trying to describe that approach is not so easy . One leading authority on organic_chemistry at another university is asked to explain Olah ' s thought process . The chemist throws_up his hands in mock despair . &quot; Olah is just so Hungarian , &quot; he says . &quot; He makes these jumps. &quot; He is alluding to the intimidating reputation earned by a generation of Hungarian researchers , such_as atomic scientists Leo Szilard and Edward Teller , whose intellectual prowess and indomitable energy in post-World War II America led them to prominence in the fields of physics , chemistry and mathematics . On more_than one occasion , Olah ' s particular view of the facts put him in conflict with the established experts of the day . Caltech chemist John D . Roberts says &quot; he ' s upset a lot of apple carts in the process. &quot; His clash with Nobel Prize-winning chemist Herbert C . Brown at Purdue University is legendary . For 20 years -- in seminars , conferences and in the research papers where academic combat is waged -- the two warred over the structure of a certain obscure compound called 2-norbornyl cation . &quot; It was very harsh . . . lonely , &quot; he says . &quot; I kept a very low profile on some research for very many years . I was hoping my chemistry would speak_for itself. &quot; Eventually , the facts proved Olah correct . &quot; To accumulate basic knowledge just for the sake of understanding , I think , is essential , &quot; he says . &quot; You never know when some obscure , completely unimportant fact becomes very important . . . . Sometimes the practical results take a long_time to come , so you must have some faith. &quot;</TEXT>
