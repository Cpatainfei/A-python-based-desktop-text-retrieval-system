   <HEADLINE> EASING OF SMOKING BANS SUBMITTED FOR BALLOT ; ELECTIONS : PHILIP MORRIS PUSHES FOR A STATE STANDARD TO REPLACE LOCAL LAWS . LATE SURGE OF INITIATIVES IS A SURPRISE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tobacco giant Philip Morris announced Monday that it has gathered enough signatures to place an initiative on California ' s November ballot to abolish all local smoking bans and replace them with looser statewide standards . The announcement raised the prospect of as_many as five highly charged , petition-generated propositions going before voters . With the deadline approaching for getting measures qualified for the November ballot , supporters of a plan to attack all forms of public funding for illegal immigrants say they will turn_in their signatures next week . Others measures that have qualified or appear to be headed for the same ballot include the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; criminal justice sentencing plan , an overhaul of the health_insurance system and a 4 % sales tax on gasoline to pay_for mass transit . The late surge in initiatives comes as something of a surprise . Early in the year , consultants involved in the initiative business believed that only the &quot; three strikes &quot; and gasoline_tax proposals would be_on the ballot . But then Philip Morris quietly funded its signature-gathering campaign , while backers of the health_insurance overhaul mounted a massive volunteer effort , supplemented at the end by paid gatherers and supported by organized labor . At the same time , proponents of the immigration measure mounted their largely volunteer effort . At a Los Angeles news_conference Monday , Ellen Merlo , a vice_president for Philip Morris U.S.A. , said the cigarette manufacturer ' s paid petition effort obtained 607 # 000 signatures of registered voters . Those names will be submitted to county registrars of voters . Officials have until June 30 to verify that the initiative has the requisite 424 # 000 valid signatures . Several people claimed they were misled by signature gatherers in the costly and sophisticated petition drive . Many complained that they thought they were signing a petition to ban smoking , when in fact it is a measure backed by the tobacco_industry to knock_down tougher local laws . Acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller issued warnings to the proponents and is continuing to investigate some of the complaints . But Miller said he doubts that the drive was so flawed that it will be deemed invalid . Miller said a bigger problem may be time . He had directed initiative proponents to submit their signatures by April 22 to give his office and the counties time to count the signatures . &quot; I ' m not saying it can ' t be done , but it is marginal , &quot; Miller said . So far , no other cigarette manufacturer has joined the campaign . But Philip Morris , the nation ' s largest cigarette maker , spent $ 491 # 000 on the effort to get the measure on the ballot , Merlo said . The campaign is certain to cost millions of dollars , but she said Philip Morris has not decided how much to spend . The measure is also being backed by some bar , hotel and restaurant owners . The initiative ' s goal is to abolish local anti-smoking ordinances , replacing them with a statewide standard that would , for example , allow smoking in 25 % of a restaurant ' s seating_area . Under the initiative , restaurants and other businesses would have to meet certain ventilation standards in_order to permit smoking . Health groups note , however , that those standards are not designed to counter the ill effects of secondhand smoke . &quot; This is an initiative that really does address the preferences and the rights of all Californians , &quot; said Merlo , who came_to Los Angeles from Philip Morris ' New York headquarters . &quot; There are some people who do find tobacco objectionable and I do believe this initiative does address their concerns. &quot; Jack Nicholl , the political consultant for health groups opposing the tobacco initiative , repeated his charge that petition gatherers tricked people into signing the measure by telling them that it was designed to restrict smoking . &quot; In order to even have a chance , they ' ll need to spend tens of millions , &quot; Nicholl said . &quot; They ' ll have to so brainwash the public . I don ' t see how they can win it if we do an aggressive job of getting_out the lie. &quot; Other measures that may make_it onto the November ballot include : * The immigration measure , backed by Howard Ezell , a former Immigration and Naturalization Service official . He said backers had obtained 560 # 000 signatures , but want to gather another 100 # 000 this week . The initiative seeks to cut all public funding for illegal immigrants and would require local law_enforcement agencies to help the INS in the effort to find and deport illegal immigrants . In its most controversial provision , the measure would require schools to verify the immigration status of pupils and expel students whose parents cannot prove their legal_status . Schools also would be required to report to law_enforcement agencies the names of parents they believe are in the country illegally . * The health_care initiative , which would scrap the current health_care system and replace it with one administered by the state . To finance the universal health_care coverage , the health_care measure envisions increases in business payroll taxes , personal_income taxes , and a $ 1-a-pack tax added_to cigarettes . * The 4 % gasoline sales tax . Sponsored by the Planning and Conservation League , the tax would fund various mass transit and earthquake retrofitting projects . * The one citizen-generated initiative already certified by the secretary_of_state for the November ballot is the &quot; three strikes &quot; proposition , which would impose sentences of 25 years to life for criminals who commit a third felony after having committed two prior serious or violent felonies . The initiative mirrors a law passed_by the Legislature and signed into law earlier this year .</TEXT>
