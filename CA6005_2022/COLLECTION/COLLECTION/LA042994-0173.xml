   <HEADLINE> AMES GETS LIFE ; ADMITS BETRAYING DOUBLE_AGENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former CIA agent Aldrich H . Ames calmly admitted Thursday that he gave the KGB the names of Soviet officials cooperating with American intelligence -- many of whom were later executed -- as well as the details of super-secret U.S. surveillance of the East Bloc . For his crimes , Ames was sentenced by a federal judge to life in prison without possibility of parole , the harshest punishment possible under current law . In a statement striking for its lack of remorse , Ames dismissed the idea that his actions caused any significant harm to his country , saying &quot; there is no rational need &quot; for most CIA operations . &quot; I had come_to believe that the espionage business as carried_out by the CIA and a_few other American agencies was and is a self-serving sham , &quot; he told U.S. District Judge Claude M . Hilton . &quot; The information our vast intelligence network acquires at considerable human and ethical costs is generally insignificant or irrelevant to our policy-makers ' needs. &quot; Ames , 52 , who rose to chief of Soviet counterintelligence in the CIA ' s Soviet-East European division during 31 years with the agency , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage as part of a negotiated agreement in return for a recommendation of leniency for his wife , Rosario . Mrs . Ames , 41 , whose role was described by the government as considerably smaller than her husband ' s , also pleaded guilty Thursday , but to lesser charges of &quot; aiding , advising and encouraging &quot; her husband ' s activities . The Ameses , arrested Feb . 21 at their suburban Virginia home , also pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade federal income_taxes for concealing an estimated $ 2.5 million in cash payments from the Russians . Officials said that Ames agreed to cooperate in exchange for a lighter sentence for his wife , who has experienced emotional problems since her jailing . Ames also believed their 5-year-old son , Paul , needs the care of his mother , the officials said . Mrs . Ames will be sentenced Aug . 26 to a term of 63 to 72 months but she will receive credit for time served since their arrest , provided her husband cooperates with authorities . The four-month delay in her sentencing will allow prosecutors to assess Ames ' cooperation in disclosing whether any colleagues at the CIA assisted him , either knowingly or unknowingly . Under the plea agreement , both of the Ameses must forfeit all_of their remaining assets , including their $ 540 # 000 suburban home , Jaguar and Honda cars , Ames ' pension for 31 years in the CIA , all domestic bank_accounts and all foreign accounts and profits from any book they might write . At a news_conference following the pleas , U.S. Atty . Helen F . Fahey said that this was &quot; the most damaging spy case in the history of this country. &quot; She said that U.S. intelligence officials now will begin &quot; an extensive debriefing &quot; of Ames to learn even more about the damage to CIA operations caused by his espionage and whether anyone else helped him . Ames has not previously cooperated with federal investigators because he was maintaining silence on the advice of his attorney , Plato Cacheris . Espionage was a capital_offense until ruled_out in a series of Supreme Court decisions . The Senate-passed crime bill restores capital_punishment for espionage , but even if the House agrees to the Senate language , Ames would not be affected . A &quot; statement of facts &quot; filed by the government Thursday disclosed that Ames had caused greater damage to U.S. security than previously had been revealed . Ames ' actions ranged from naming to the Soviets at least 11 military and intelligence officials in their country who spied for the CIA or other friendly intelligence services , to turning_over &quot; a substantial amount of top-secret information , including signals intelligence , &quot; a reference_to the interception of Russian communications . Those communications could range from military_units in the field to more sophisticated links between embassies and satellite transmissions . Knowledge of the security breach would enable the Russians to feed disinformation , develop more secure methods of communication and determine which secrets had been exposed . &quot; Ames ' compromise of these penetrations of the Soviet military and intelligence services deprived the United States of extremely valuable intelligence material for years to come , &quot; prosecutors said . At least four of the U.S. spies were arrested and executed after Ames revealed their identities , the government said . Ames maintained that he was &quot; never personally advised by the KGB or anyone else as_to the disposition and fate of the sources he compromised , &quot; the statement of facts noted . When he began spying for the KGB in the spring of 1985 , Ames ' CIA position &quot; guaranteed him access to most information relating to penetrations of the Soviet military and intelligence services and intelligence_operations against the Soviet_Union , &quot; the statement said . While stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Rome from 1986 to 1989 , Ames told the KGB about CIA activities against the Soviet_Union , including a large_number of double-agent operations and of U.S. knowledge of double-agents working for the Soviets , prosecutors said . After he returned to CIA headquarters in 1989 , Ames provided the KGB with classified information both related and unrelated to his specific CIA assignments . The statement did not disclose how Ames obtained the unrelated material , which would be denied to him under normal CIA practices of &quot; compartmentation. &quot; Dressed in khaki prison garb and speaking in a low monotone , Ames said in the jammed courtroom that in April , 1985 , &quot; I conceived a kind of confidence_game to play_on the KGB &quot; to obtain funds to pay personal debts . &quot; In exchange for $ 50 # 000 I provided the KGB with the identities of several Soviet citizens who appeared to be cooperating with the CIA inside the Soviet_Union , &quot; he said . &quot; I suspected that their cooperation was not genuine , that their true loyalty was to the KGB , and therefore I could cause them no harm. &quot; But Ames said that a_few months later , &quot; I did something still not entirely explicable even to me -- without preconditions or any demand for payment , I volunteered to the KGB information identifying virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me. &quot; He said that &quot; to my enduring surprise , &quot; the Soviets replied that they were paying $ 2 million &quot; in gratitude for the information. &quot; While expressing &quot; deepest sympathy &quot; for the victims of his actions , Ames suggested that their fate was an expected risk of the intelligence business . &quot; We made similar choices and suffer similar consequences , &quot; he said . Ames showed emotion only in defending his Colombian-born wife , who he insisted &quot; had no knowledge of what information I furnished &quot; to the Soviet_Union and later the Russians . Ames said he concealed his spying from his wife until the last 1 1 / 2 years of his activities . She pleaded with him to break_off with the Russians but he manipulated and blackmailed her to avoid doing so . Ames contended that she had no knowledge of information he was furnishing to the Russians and , while she &quot; knew that I had received a great_deal of money , she had no way to associate such sums with the gravity of the information I was passing. &quot; In the government ' s &quot; statement of facts &quot; on Mrs . Ames , prosecutors said she provided &quot; advice and support &quot; for his espionage once she learned of it . &quot; The defendant did not , however , personally handle or transmit any classified information or documents to the Russians , nor did she meet her husband ' s Russian handlers , &quot; it noted .
