   <TEXT> A judge who said he planned to throw_out felony grand theft charges against two former Oxnard card casino promoters charged with stealing $ 10 # 000 in an unrelated construction deal changed his mind Monday . Superior_Court Judge Allan Steele denied a defense motion to dismiss the charges against Michael E . Wooten , 45 , and Frank Marasco , 48.He ordered the men to appear in court today for the start of their trial . Previously , Steele had said he was inclined to dismiss the charges . Wooten , of Camarillo , and Marasco , of Ventura , are accused of submitting a false $ 10 # 000 voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors for work_on a development project in Santa Paula , prosecutors said . Instead of paying a construction firm for overseeing the work , the defendants spent the money , prosecutors said . Steele ' s ruling Monday was the second setback for the men in the past four days . On Thursday , a judge fined them $ 3 # 000 each after they pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of money_laundering . Each defendant admitted violating state law by making $ 998 in small contributions indirectly to two Oxnard councilmen , one former councilwoman and a state assemblyman . Both cases against the defendants were investigated by the Ventura County district_attorney ' s newly formed political corruption unit . DWAYNE BRAY</TEXT>
