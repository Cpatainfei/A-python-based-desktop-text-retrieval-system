   <TEXT> Of the sounds humanity has made on Earth , only a nuclear_explosion is louder than the unthrottled thunder of the Saturn rockets that carried men to the moon . On July 16 , 1969 , when a Saturn lifted the Apollo 11 capsule free_of Earth on its historic journey to the moon , one man hundreds of miles from the launch_pad in Florida felt its apocalyptic energy reverberate in his marrow : NASA Flight Director Gene Kranz , on the edge of his seat in the windowless &quot; trench &quot; of NASA ' s Mission Control in Houston . Neil Armstrong , the Apollo 11 commander , was the first human to walk on the moon . Kranz was the man who guided him the last miles onto its dusty , pockmarked surface . Of America ' s secular heroes , few stir the spirit as deeply as the astronauts who a generation ago left the first footsteps on the moon . But few ever knew the names or the stories of the faceless , can-do engineers who directed them there safely . If Armstrong -- the Apollo astronaut whose features were masked by his mirrored helmet -- was the public image of American space prowess , Kranz -- the hard-charging flight director -- was its private face . Armstrong was a paragon of Protestant test_pilot cool : terse , aloof , unknowable . He was a blue-eyed Eagle_Scout with a hesitant , lopsided grin , so shy that there are almost no clear pictures of him standing on the moon ' s surface , only photographs of his footprints and his shadow . He declined to be interviewed for this story , as he declines almost all interview requests . Kranz was unabashedly sentimental , a fierce agency loyalist who played Sousa marches in his office to pump up his adrenaline . He relished his in-house reputation as a relentless taskmaster who earned the nickname &quot; General Savage. &quot; Today -- 25 years after the moon landing -- Armstrong is still a national folk hero . Kranz is virtually unknown outside an inner_circle of NASA veterans . What they share is the stuff of history -- a journey given only once to the human_race . Both men were born in small Ohio towns barely 100 miles apart at the bottom of the Depression . Both were fighter_pilots in the 1950s . They never met until they joined NASA . They never spoke directly during the moon mission . They almost never speak now . They were never so close as when they were farthest apart -- when Armstrong , 240 # 000 miles from Earth , was searching for a safe landing site only a_few miles above the moon , with capsule emergency alarms flashing , the on-board computer on the verge of a breakdown , and only scant minutes left before the landing fuel ran_out . For those 13 minutes of the lunar descent , half a_billion people held their breath . The efforts of 300 # 000 technicians , the labor of eight years at a cost of $ 25 billion , a Cold_War rivalry , and a murdered President ' s promise hung_in the balance . When Armstrong set the lunar lander down safely , the national victory was so complete that for decades the Soviet government would officially deny that there had even been a race to the moon . It was Kranz -- in a locked control_room with a dozen young engineers relaying data buzzing in the earphones of his headset -- who decided to override the alarms and give Armstrong the chance to land the spacecraft on the moon . * Gene Kranz had a style all his own . There was the frown , of course . Human nature gave him that . His voice had a flat Midwestern edge that , even at its friendliest , retained a hard edge of reflexive command . Then there was that blond bristle of a crew_cut , shaved so close you could see the muscles tighten at the back of his skull when he concentrated . He owed the style to the Air_Force and the close trim to a barber in Clear Lake , Tex . &quot; I was the most emotional of the flight directors , &quot; Kranz , 61 , said in a recent interview . &quot; Space really got me all honked up. &quot; Kranz has the kind of mind that seems happiest when it is running a dozen trains of thought along parallel tracks -- the sort of fellow , friends say , who relaxes by working_on a full-scale aerobatic biplane in his garage , pruning prize roses and baking bread all_in one afternoon . As the flight director for the Apollo 11 landing -- and head of NASA ' s entire flight control_operations branch -- he made $ 21 # 432 a year . That was enough to raise six children . Five work in the space_program . But it was the vests his wife made that set him off from everybody else in mission operations . Before each mission , Marta Kranz scoured the fabric shops of Houston for a bold swatch of material to sew into one of his special flight vests . They became as much a part of the early space_program as splashdown cigars and ticker_tape parades . Today , Kranz still has 15 vests in an upstairs closet of the modest home the couple moved to when NASA set_up operations in Houston . He proudly lays them out on the sofa for a visitor : Paisley brocades . Silver and gold lame . Carnival stripes . Velvet . The simplest -- a plain white silk twill vest yellowed now to ivory -- is what he wore for Apollo 11 . White was the color reserved for the leader of the White Flight , as his flight director ' s shift was known within mission operations . White Flight was in_charge of the lunar landing . When Kranz retired this year , NASA also retired the color . * As a boy in Toledo , Ohio , Kranz never cared much about rocket ships or spaceflight . But as a military pilot in the Pacific in 1957 , he was impressed by the way the launch of the Russian Sputnik galvanized people around the world . A few years after he was discharged -- working as a test engineer at Holloman Air_Force Base in New Mexico -- he saw an ad in Aviation Week magazine . The government wanted engineers for a fledgling space task group being organized at the federal flight research facility in Langley , Va . He didn ' t hesitate . &quot; I just felt that space was the next thing coming_in aviation , &quot; he said . &quot; It was higher , faster . It had the risk. &quot; Before he knew exactly what was happening , he found himself on a plane headed for Cape Canaveral , Fla. , with orders to prepare_for the first unmanned test of the Mercury Redstone rocket that would later carry the first American -- Alan B . Shepard -- into space . &quot; They said , ' Go_down to the Cape and write us a countdown. ' They put me on an airplane . I had never written a countdown , &quot; Kranz said , referring to the complex engineering procedures that lead_up to a rocket launch . &quot; I landed at Patrick Air_Force Base and didn ' t even know which way the Cape was . &quot; There was a guy there in a Chevy Malibu with a surfboard in the back . He says : ' What are you looking_for ? ' I said : ' I got_to go_out to the Cape. ' He said : ' Hop in. ' So boom , off we go . I didn ' t even bother to ask who he was . &quot; About two-thirds of the way_out there I found_out it was Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper . That was my introduction to the original seven astronauts , &quot; he said . When the moment for liftoff came , the Redstone rocket died on the launch_pad . That was his introduction to spaceflight . * When Kranz signed_up for the space race , he was 27 years old . NASA was still in the making . There was no organized civilian space_program to speak_of . There was no such thing as Mission Control . People like Kranz , his mentor -- a short , icy engineer named Christopher Columbus Kraft , the agency ' s first flight director -- and operations chief Walt Williams built it from the raw_material of_their_own personalities and engineering styles . At the apex of the structure they created through trial_and_error stood the flight director -- a single person with absolute authority over operations during a space mission . He had ultimate control when a manned space_capsule was in orbit -- and ultimate responsibility if a technical mishap resulted in the death of an astronaut crew . In the end , it was the flight director ' s decision to abort a mission -- or to proceed in the face of engineering uncertainty . &quot; The Flight Director may , after analysis of the flight , take any necessary action required for the successful completion of the mission , &quot; the mission rules stated . Any error was unforgivable . And in the 1960s and early 1970s -- the years of Apollo -- Gene Kranz thought there was no better job in the world . * Kranz became so obsessed with the engineering discipline of mission operations that in the months before Apollo 11 he filled a brown notebook 3 1 / 2 inches thick_with personal notes on how to orchestrate every second of the flight . &quot; You have to be intensely aware of . . . pulling this ballet together that involved everybody doing the right thing at the right time under a constantly changing set of circumstances , &quot; he said . But any misgivings , confusion or uncertainty he kept under_control and out of view . &quot; No way can you ever , ever , ever evidence confusion , concern , lack of understanding , &quot; he said . &quot; You have to be in_charge . You are the guy . You have to be cooler than cool , smarter than smart . &quot; I did everything by the numbers . I had checklists upon checklists . If I wasn ' t ahead of everybody on my team , I didn ' t feel I was doing my job . &quot; I was constantly testing myself : What am I going_to do if . . . ? &quot; * In the process , something of Gene Kranz became a permanent part of manned spaceflight . At the Johnson Space Center in Houston , the Mission Control_room Kranz and his colleagues used for Apollo has changed only slightly since 1969 . Today , as NASA juggles space shuttle missions and prepares to operate a manned space_station , its vocabulary and work habits mimic the obsessive attention to detail and studious nonchalance of flight operations engineers like Kranz and his Apollo colleagues . During a recent technical rehearsal of an upcoming shuttle flight , loose-leaf binders and foam coffee_cups littered the beige and gray flight consoles . The half-light from computer monitors provided much of the illumination . The faces were young and , in the shadows , energized . Sprawling at their consoles , the new generation of NASA engineers flirted_with simulated disasters . They were rehearsing landing emergencies with the crew of the upcoming shuttle mission . They handled each crisis in cryptic murmurs , a language of nods , glances and engineering acronyms . The movements were exaggeratedly casual , the tension so internalized as_to be invisible . The calmer things appeared , the worse they must be . Milt Heflin , lead flight director for the shuttle mission expected to begin Wednesday , watched the exercise from an unused console , patched into the conversations by a frayed headset cable . Heflin , selected as a flight director by Kranz 11 years ago , called the job &quot; one of the last bastions of common sense. &quot; He has handled 19 shuttle flights , including the Hubble Space Telescope repair mission in December -- hailed as the most complex space operation since the moon landings . At the time of the Apollo 11 mission , Heflin was a junior NASA technician fresh out of college . Kranz was 36 and had , for the purposes of flight operations , become common_sense personified . * With just 10 minutes remaining before Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were scheduled to swing back around from behind the moon and begin their descent to the lunar surface , Kranz did the one thing no flight director was allowed to do . He went_off the loop . NASA was so concerned with capturing every aspect of the Apollo missions that all communications -- every &quot; loop &quot; -- in the control_room were to be officially monitored and recorded . History wanted to listen . But Kranz had set_up a private circuit where he could talk to his flight controllers out of official earshot , and now he called them together for a confidential &quot; pulse check. &quot; Stephen G . Bales , then a 26-year-old , $ 7 # 000-a-year engineer from Iowa , manned the guidance console for the lunar descent . Twenty-five years later , he sat_down at the same gray console and recalled Kranz ' s words as best he could : &quot; We are getting ready to do something no one else has ever done . You are trained . You are prepared . We will do_well . No matter how it turns_out , when we walk_out_of this room , I will walk_out with you . . . . &quot; Kranz ordered the doors of Mission Control locked . &quot; Battle short , &quot; he sang out curtly , ordering the circuit_breakers locked down so no power_failure could interfere with the landing operation . Then , aboard the Eagle , as the lunar lander was named , Armstrong and Aldrin emerged from the radio silence caused by orbiting behind the moon . Alone aboard the orbiting command capsule , astronaut Michael Collins waited for them to start the descent . Then the problems started . Communications were unusually distorted and static-filled . Could they get enough data to allow the flight to continue ? Yes . Go , Kranz ordered . Then static drowned_out all critical data for 30 seconds . When the signals picked_up again , radar readings revealed the craft was moving too fast . If it continued to accelerate , it might overshoot the landing zone and Kranz would have to order an abort , Bales recalled . Kranz stood at the flight director ' s console , his palms so damp they left perfect prints on his notebook when he leaned forward . Whispering in his ears were a dozen voices from six communications loops and the air-to-ground communications_channel . Then , on board the spacecraft , a power meter failed . No sooner had the ground team responded to that problem than a computer_program alarm flashed in the capsule and on the meters in Mission Control . That signaled that the on-board computer was getting overloaded . &quot; I hear a very innocuous call from the crew : A program alarm , &quot; Kranz recalled . &quot; About that time , Steve Bales echoes it . Then it echoes in the back_room . Program alarm . Program alarm . Program alarm. &quot; Would they have to abort ? Sitting at the guidance console he occupied when the alarm came_through , Bales remembers his controlled panic . &quot; I was still almost in overflow from the first problem . I could not remember what I was supposed to do for the life of me for a second. &quot; The alarm kept_on . &quot; We ' re go_on that alarm ? &quot; Kranz said , asking if he could let the landing proceed . Bales hesitated . Voices on four or five loops dissected the problem in a knowledgeable gabble in his ear . Within seconds , he determined , the problem could be safely ignored . Kranz grunted acknowledgment . The descent would continue . The computer alarm went_off again . &quot; We ' re go , &quot; Bales told Kranz , more confidently . Again the alarm came . Again . &quot; Hang tight , everybody , &quot; Kranz said over the flight director ' s loop . &quot; Eagle , you ' re looking great . You ' re go , &quot; said capsule communicator Charles Duke , relaying Kranz ' s assent . Duke was the only one in Mission Control allowed to talk directly to the crew in flight . Once given the go-ahead , Armstrong proceeded as planned and took manual control at 2 # 000 feet . His flying skills were so formidable that three times -- nursing a crippled jet onto the deck of the carrier Essex , at the controls of an X-15 , and then in a Gemini space_capsule -- he turned near-disaster into triumph . Aboard the lunar lander , he steered the craft back and forth , seeking a safe spot in the boulder-strewn landscape . In Houston , a flight controller announced on the loop how much longer the lander could fly as descent fuel levels dropped . Sixty seconds left . Thirty seconds . Fifteen . Through the static , Aldrin reported seeing dust from the surface , blown_up by the engine exhaust . &quot; OK , engine stop , &quot; Aldrin radioed . When he realized the spacecraft had touched_down , Kranz froze . &quot; Houston , Tranquillity Base here , &quot; Armstrong radioed . &quot; The Eagle has landed. &quot; It was 3:18 p.m. Houston time , July 20 , 1969 . The muffled cheers and applause from the spectators rumbled through the double-paned glass observation windows into the control_room . Kranz couldn ' t talk or will himself to move . &quot; The reality hit . It stopped being a simulation in that moment and started being a real event , &quot; Kranz said . Elation was the one thing he had not rehearsed . To break the spell , Kranz slammed his arm down on his console as hard as he could . The pain allowed him to breathe again . &quot; I want quiet in this room , &quot; he ordered . The mission clock was running . Two days later he was shaving and noticed his forearm was black and blue from wrist to elbow . * Armstrong resigned from NASA within 18 months of his return to Earth and withdrew into the privacy of a small farm outside Lebanon , Ohio , shunning publicity . There would be no autobiography , political_campaigns or commercial endorsements . Until 1979 , Armstrong taught aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati , then confined his public activities to a_few corporate boards and chairmanship of AIL Systems , a small high-technology engineering firm on Long_Island . Kranz gave the rest of his working life to Mission Control . In 1970 , when an on-board explosion threatened the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts halfway to the moon , Kranz was at the flight director ' s console and helped save them . In 1986 , Kranz -- still in the mission director ' s chair -- had no way to avert disaster as an explosion destroyed the space shuttle Challenger . And last winter , as space shuttle astronauts repaired the Hubble Space Telescope , Kranz oversaw the entire Mission Operations Directorate from the same chair . He retired in March . The third-floor control_room , from which he orchestrated the moon landing , is_on the National Register of Historic Places . NASA plans to make_it a museum exhibit . Kranz , reflecting on Armstrong ' s distaste for public attention or adulation , pronounced his own judgment on the Apollo 11 astronaut and , in doing so , unconsciously announced his own epitaph : &quot; He wanted to do something , rather than be something , &quot; Kranz said . &quot; And he did it. &quot; NEXT : California ' s space industry tries to offset uncertainty .
