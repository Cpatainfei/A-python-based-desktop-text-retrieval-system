   <TEXT> What a treat to read a good_story told by a smart , if not always likable , narrator . We meet Ellen Gulden , the young_woman at the heart of Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen ' s provocative second novel ( the best-selling &quot; Object_Lessons &quot; was her first ) , soon after she ' s graduated from Harvard and taken a magazine job in New York . The brightest and eldest of three children , she has always seen herself and been seen by others as her English_professor father ' s clone -- literate , ironic , ambitious -- rather than her homemaker mother ' s daughter . Her life to date has been one academic triumph after another , your basic 99 percentile on the SATs type-A personality . She ' s used to being in control , used to pleasant surprises , used to success . And then her mother gets cancer . Her mother , Kate , whom Ellen has always regarded with affectionate condescension . Her mother the famous decorator of community Christmas_trees . Her mother the why-buy-it-when-you-can-make-it craftsperson . Her mother the indestructible domestic . Ellen complies with great resentment to her father ' s demand that she relocate back home to manage the illness , a move that is clearly equally as difficult for her mother . Ellen is the girl child -- far less involvement is expected of her younger brothers . Telling herself that the situation is only temporary , for her mother ' s diagnosis is terminal , she does her duty . As Quindlen deftly moves her story forward , the first jolt for Ellen -- and for us -- is the emergence of the real Kate Gulden . Forced to deal with her mother as a person and not just a parent , Ellen finds the 40-something Kate to be far more self-aware , complicated , and stoic than she ever suspected , a mature woman who has acquired wisdom that Ellen is intrigued to learn . &quot; The being happy , &quot; her mother explains . &quot; It ' s so_much easier , to learn to love what you have instead of yearning always for what you ' re missing , or what you imagine you ' re missing . It ' s so_much more peaceful. &quot; When mother and daughter form a book club consisting_of only themselves , Kate reveals that she ' s always been bored and annoyed with Jane Austen ' s depiction of proper and contented female characters -- the very type of woman Ellen has always imagined Kate to admire , to , in fact , be . &quot; We ' d made her simpler all her life , simpler than her real self , &quot; Ellen explains to her brother . &quot; We ' d made her what we needed her to be . We ' d made her ours , our one true thing. &quot; Almost simultaneously with drawing closer to Kate , Ellen ' s estimation of her father diminishes -- first from what strikes her as the unfairness of his imposition on her time , and later because of what she regards_as his avoidance of his husbandly responsibility . The family dynamic changes , evolves , divides for the first time along gender lines . Ultimately Ellen must accept the fact that she has had less of a comprehension of the inherent compromises of her parents ' union than she once imagined . &quot; No one knows what goes_on inside a marriage , &quot; she concludes . &quot; I read that once ; the aphorism ended ' except for the two people who are in it. ' But I suspect that even that is not the truth , that even two people married to each other for many many years may have only passing similarities in their perceptions and their expectations . . . . But I know from experience that those least capable of truly assessing any marriage are the children who come_out of it . We style them as we need them , to excuse our faults , to insulate ourselves from our own expendability or indispensability. &quot; And then , one terrible night , Kate dies . It was a mercy , almost anyone would agree . Kate had ceased to be herself , was subsumed by suffering . Her death was for the best , it would appear -- until an autopsy reveals that the cause was not natural but an overdose of pain- killers . Ellen is falsely accused of euthanasia , and though she steadfastly denies committing the deed -- more , she judges , from a lack of courage than from any moral or philosophical hesitations -- she is arrested and charged with the crime . In the process of awaiting an appearance before the grand_jury , she becomes an unwilling poster girl for mercy killing , the unlikely catalyst for a raging national ethical debate , the public ' s champion for an act she didn ' t , in fact , perform . . . though she ' s sure she knows who did . It would be unfair to the reader to reveal the outcome of this unfailingly interesting conundrum , except to say that Quindlen is far too complex a writer and a thinker to settle for any facile solutions . And all along the way to the novel ' s believable , satisfying conclusion , we are presented with insights and challenges to ponder , ideas that resonate concerning the nature and the method of change . Finally , like Ellen herself , we leave &quot; One True Thing &quot; stimulated and challenged , more thoughtful than when we began .</TEXT>
