   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 27 DAYS AND COUNTING ; SUPER STOPPER ; WHEN CHIPS ARE DOWN , GOYCOCHEA IS ARGENTINA ' S ACE IN THE GOAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If not for the bad_luck of one Argentine goalkeeper , and the bad attitude of another , it is doubtful the world would ever have heard of Sergio Javier Goycochea . Nery Pumpido was in the nets in 1986 when Argentina won the World Cup in Mexico . His understudy that year was Luis Islas . Four years later , when Argentine Coach Carlos Salvador Bilardo chose his three goalkeepers for Italia ' 90 , Pumpido was his first choice , Islas his second and Goycochea third . But Islas refused to play another World Cup as No . 2 and was dropped from the team . That moved Goycochea up a notch . If anything happened to Pumpido , he would become Argentina ' s last line_of_defense . Pumpido ' s luck had never been good . In one bizarre accident , he caught his wedding_ring on a hook holding the netting to the crossbar and nearly lost the finger . Luckily , surgeons were able to repair the damage and save his career . Then , in Argentina ' s opening game in the 1990 World Cup , against Cameroon in Milan , Pumpido fumbled a header by striker Francois Omam-Biyik and the ball trickled across the line to give the African team a 1-0 victory and a momentous upset over the defending world champion . Even before Argentina had made its way down to Naples to play the Soviet_Union in its next match , Bilardo was having second_thoughts about Pumpido . But he was spared making a decision . Twelve minutes into the game with the Soviets , Pumpido ' s bad_luck caught_up_with him again . He collided_with teammate Julio Olarticoechea and suffered a broken leg . As Pumpido was being carried from the field on a stretcher , Bilardo escorted Goycochea onto the field and into the history books . For the next four years , Goycochea built a reputation as a goalkeeper of extraordinary ability , one who exhibited a priceless gift for saving penalty kicks . The nicknames came fast and furious . Goycochea became the &quot; Prince of Penalties &quot; and the &quot; King of the Shootout. &quot; To his teammates , however , he remained simply &quot; Goyco. &quot; A penalty kick_in soccer is virtually an automatic goal . The ball is placed on the penalty spot , 12 yards from the net . The goalkeeper is positioned on his line and is not allowed to move until the ball is struck . About 90 % of all penalty kicks result in goals . But not against Goycochea . &quot; Saving penalties has very little to do with luck , more to do with intuition , &quot; he said . &quot; A goalkeeper can do one of three things : dive left , dive right or stay_in_place . Often , you look_into the eye of the penalty-taker to try to find a clue . that ' s what I do. &quot; World Cup ' 90 in Italy made Goycochea a hero in Argentina and a household name in the rest of the soccer world . The Copa America , or South_American Championship , tournaments of 1991 in Chile and 1993 in Ecuador established his place in the history of the game . It all began in Naples . But it as easily could have ended there , too . Goycochea had not been_on the field for more_than a minute against the Soviets when a header by Oleg Kuznetsov caught him out of position . But as misfortune had followed Pumpido , so good_luck followed Goycochea . For whatever improbable reason , Diego Maradona was back on defense , positioned in front of the net . Maradona stuck_out a hand and deflected Kuznetsov ' s shot . The crowd saw the violation , but Swedish referee Erik Fredricksson missed it . The hand ball went unpunished and all_of Argentina breathed again . The Soviets were beaten , 2-0 , and a 1-1 tie against Romania in the final first-round game earned the_Argentines a place in the second round . that ' s where the Goycochea legend began . Playing in Turin ' s magnificent Stadium of the Alps , Argentina was subjected_to wave after wave of Brazilian attacks . Shots flew goalward from all angles . Some went wide , some flew_high , some hit the posts or crossbar and some were saved by Goycochea . Suddenly , a brilliant pass from Maradona produced a goal by Claudio Caniggia and Brazil had been beaten , 1-0 . Goycochea had a shutout and Argentina was in the quarterfinals . Yugoslavia was next . The score was 0-0 after 90 minutes and unchanged after 120 . That brought_up the best-of-five penalty shootout . Yugoslavia missed its first attempt and Goycochea saved the fourth . Maradona missed for Argentina , which led , 3-2 , when Faruhk Hadzibegic stepped_up to take Yugoslavia ' s last kick . &quot; I feinted to dive right and threw myself back to the left , &quot; Goycochea said . &quot; He hit the ball well , but not so powerfully . I can ' t really remember what happened after that . It ' s all a blur . I just started running like a madman . I remember Diego ( Maradona ) shouting : ' You ' re a genius ! A genius ! ' Then it was as if the world fell in. &quot; Hailed as an immediate hero , not only in his native town of Lima , about 60 miles from Buenos Aires , but throughout Argentina , Goycochea proved in the next game that it had not been a fluke . Playing Italy , the World Cup host , in the semifinal in Naples , Argentina again forced a tie , this time 1-1 after overtime , and the match went_to penalty kicks . The Argentines made their first four . Flinging himself to his left each time , Goycochea produced two splendid saves against Roberto Donadoni and Aldo Serena , and Argentina won the shootout , 4-3 , advancing to the final and reducing all_of Italy to tears . But the_Argentine dream ended in Rome . A superbly struck penalty kick by Andreas Brehme barely eluded Goycochea ' s outstretched fingers and flashed inside the left post . The World Cup was over . West Germany had won , 1-0 . Since then , Goycochea has , if anything , enhanced his reputation . Coming_into World Cup ' 94 , he has yet to be beaten_in a penalty shootout and has saved a remarkable eight penalty kicks for the national team . Blessed with excellent reflexes and cat-like quickness , he adds_to the mix a calmness and confidence that both settles his teammates and unnerves the opposition . &quot; People started suggesting ( in Italia ' 90 ) that I had studied every player ' s penalty technique , &quot; he told London ' s World Soccer magazine . &quot; that ' s all wrong . I didn ' t do any homework at all . &quot; On a penalty , a goalkeeper has nothing to lose and everything to gain . If he saves , he ' s a hero . If the opponent scores , then he ' s only doing his duty . If all five shots go_past you , it ' s no big deal . So I didn ' t have any problems with nerves. &quot; Goycochea made one of his greatest penalty saves in the Copa America tournament in Ecuador last summer . Again , Brazil was the opponent and , again , the Brazilians had run the_Argentines ragged in the quarterfinal game in Guayaquil . But Goycochea held Brazil to a single goal and , after Argentina had tied the score late in the second_half , the match ended_up in penalty kicks . The outcome was almost a foregone_conclusion . Argentina won , 6-5 , after Goycochea had denied Boiadeiro with a stunning save that he considers his best to date . &quot; The most emotional shootout was against Italy ( in 1990 ) because it was a World Cup and it meant we reached the final , &quot; he said . &quot; But the Brazilian players are the most difficult ( to save against ) , at least on paper . They have_the_best technique and , with a slight movement , they can change the direction ( of the shot ) . &quot; Goycochea ' s penalty kick heroics against Brazil were followed by another saved penalty in a shootout against Colombia in the Copa America semifinal , and Argentina went_on to retain its South_American title , beating Mexico in the championship match . Surprisingly , Goycochea ' s success with the national team has not earned him a spot with a large European club , and he has tended to roam about since Italia ' 90 . He has played for Brest in France and for Cerro Porteno and Olimpia in Paraguay , before returning to home to lead River Plate to its most recent Argentine championship . Even then , Goycochea ' s form has been inconsistent , and he was dropped for one game by River Plate ' s 1978 World Cup-winning coach , Daniel Passarella . Goycochea dismissed the incident as irrelevant . &quot; I ' ve suffered worse moments than this in my career , and I ' m not going_to give_in now , &quot; he said , later adding , &quot; it did not bother me in the slightest . It was only for one game . River Plate went_on to win the championship. &quot; Argentina ' s humiliating 5-0 loss to Colombia in World Cup qualifying in Buenos Aires last year is similarly discounted by Goycochea . &quot; It was an accident that can happen to anyone , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s in the past , and now we are looking ahead. &quot; The future arrives next month in the shape of Nigeria , Greece and Bulgaria , Argentina ' s first three World Cup opponents . But Bilardo is not worried . If it comes_to a shootout , the coach believes he has_the_best weapon . &quot; I don ' t think it is a lottery , &quot; Bilardo said . &quot; It depends_on the players you have . . . and the goalkeeper. &quot; Argentina , he believes , is in safe hands .
