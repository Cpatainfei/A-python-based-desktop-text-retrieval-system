   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; ARAB-ISRAELI TALKS ENTER DECISIVE PHASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peace talks in the Middle_East are entering a potentially decisive phase , which , after half a century of wars declared and undeclared , could bring the Arab-Israeli conflict to an end -- and possibly within a year . Negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors are developing a momentum that is carrying them forward at a pace that people thought impossible but necessary following a long and bitter stalemate . Still , immense problems loom before all_the parties -- Israel , Jordan , Syria , Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization ; painful compromises will be required to resolve the very tough issues at the core of the conflict . Yet all_the parties are gingerly approaching those issues with a new eagerness for peace and an apparent willingness to strike the high-stakes bargains required . They realize , for example , they are not only ending the long state_of_war between Israel and its Arab neighbors but replacing it with collective_security arrangements under which the region ' s moderate nations will protect each other from extremist threats . A peace_treaty of this type between Israel and Jordan is rapidly taking_shape . Although Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan ' s King Hussein are not expected to sign such an accord when they meet in Washington later this month , Israeli officials say an agreement could be reached in weeks on the two countries ' borders , sharing of water resources and other issues . Israel and the PLO are working to broaden the self-government accord they signed last September by giving the new Palestinian Authority enhanced powers throughout the occupied West_Bank , pulling_back Israeli troops in the region and planning for the Palestinians ' first national elections . And Israel and Syria are probing each other ' s positions on Israel ' s withdrawal from the Golan Heights , security guarantees and the nature of their future relations with hints of compromise . Both hope for a breakthrough in their long-stalled talks when Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher visits the region next week , and Egyptian officials this week predicted a basic Syrian-Israeli pact within a year . All this movement stems , first , from the dramatic breakthrough in secret talks last summer between Israel and the PLO . The willingness of Israel and the Palestinians to share land over which they had fought for a century released Israel ' s other Arab neighbors to make their own peace with the Jewish state . Jordan and Syria also fear they will be left_behind as Israel and the PLO push ahead . Hussein wants the stability of a peace_treaty with Israel as a Palestinian state emerges on the West_Bank and Muslim fundamentalists challenge his rule . Syrian President Hafez Assad , who saw himself as the architect of the future Middle_East , felt himself being marginalized . A final element is real concern that the &quot; window of opportunity , &quot; opened two years ago with Rabin ' s election with a commitment to negotiations and compromise , could close -- and the chance for peace be lost -- if a comprehensive peace is not achieved before the next Israeli elections . Rabin wants to turn those elections , due by June , 1996 , into a referendum on agreements he has reached and to get a mandate for the final phase_in the negotiations with the PLO -- talks that will decide the establishment of an independent Palestinian state , the future of Jerusalem and the return of hundreds of thousands of exiled Palestinians . A comprehensive peace settlement that would , for the first time , put Israel at_peace with its immediate Arab neighbors would likely turn the election into a landslide for Rabin , his Labor_Party and its leftist allies . But should Rabin and his Labor_Party lose the election , a right-wing coalition led by the Likud Party , which opposes the Palestinian accord and withdrawal from the Golan Heights , would quickly break_off negotiations . Thus , the political imperative not only for Rabin but for Arab leaders is to strike far-reaching agreements over the next year and certainly before Israel ' s serious pre-election politicking begins in late 1995 , with a leader and political_party whose future depends_on them . Among the leaders themselves -- Rabin , Assad , Hussein and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat -- there is a strong desire to bring peace to the region and shape its future before their generation passes from the scene . Key moves were made in the past week by Israel and its Arab partners . In a televised , hourlong speech to the Jordanian Parliament last weekend , Hussein told his nation that , after years of secret meetings with Israeli leaders , he was ready to meet Rabin openly and soon to advance peace prospects . A third of Jordan ' s lawmakers are Muslim fundamentalists or leftists opposed to the peace process ; the monarch ' s announcement was a bold signal he is determined to proceed , moving ahead of other Arab countries . &quot; Jordan has decided to act primarily according to its own national interest , &quot; Hussein declared , stressing its need for political stability and economic_growth . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres responded with important commitments , including recognition of Jordan ' s sovereignty and the legitimacy of the Hashemite dynasty there and acceptance of its role as a protector of Islamic shrines in Jerusalem . With that , Hussein wrote President Clinton he was prepared to move_up a meeting with Rabin from the autumn to July 25 . Hussein also made clear in his letter that his move was contingent_on increased U.S. aid -- modernization of Jordan ' s army and air_forces and forgiveness of about $ 700 million Jordan owes the United States . On Friday , a team of Israeli officials completed arrangements for a formal visit by Peres to Jordan as part of the accelerated negotiations to conclude a peace_treaty . In Damascus , meanwhile , Syrian officials expressed their hope that Christopher can break the prolonged deadlock in talks with Israel during his forthcoming trip . Assad was ready , Syria ' s state-controlled press said , to discuss future relations with Israel once it declared its readiness to withdraw from the Golan Heights . Peres responded with a major shift in Israel ' s negotiating position . &quot; We have recognized Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights , time after time , &quot; he said . He implied an Israeli willingness to withdraw to the international border in return for &quot; full peace &quot; if security arrangements and other issues could be agreed upon . Until now , Rabin had only said Israel would pull_back on the Golan Heights but had refused to specify the line of withdrawal . Israeli officials said Friday that the coming Christopher shuttle would test Syria ' s sincerity and the forthcoming meeting between Rabin and Hussein will put pressure on Assad to move ahead -- or simply be left_behind .</TEXT>
