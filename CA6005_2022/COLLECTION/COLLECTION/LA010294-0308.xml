   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANAGAN : ' 93 / ' 94 YEAR-END REVIEW AND OUTLOOK ; DON ' T WORRY ! IT ' S JUST A NEW ERA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is the year we recognize that we ' re experiencing the first economic recovery of the information age . Until now , thanks to worries about jobs and lingering recession in some parts of the country , the recovery has seemed dubious and uncertain . But this year there will be national economic_growth of 3 % , following a burst forward at the end of 1993 , and increasing confidence even in California that we are launched on a new pattern for U.S. industry . We live_in a time of information making work more efficient , making work possible . And often we don ' t recognize it for what it is . It is not machines taking the place of employees , but rather machines enhancing human work , allowing greater output for the same amount of input -- or increases in productivity . Information -- sophisticated computer_networks and advanced telecommunications -- gives even small manufacturers like Taylor-Dunn of Anaheim the ability to hold only two days inventory as opposed to seven ; gives Chrysler Corp . the ability to design and produce a new car in two years as opposed to four ; gives Wal-Mart and its suppliers the ability to distribute goods at half of what it used to cost . The result throughout the U.S. economy is not stagnation or inflation but productivity and efficiency . U.S. business now recognizes the payoff from advanced computing and communications technology . that ' s why Commerce_Department forecasts say spending on plant and equipment will rise more_than $ 50 billion in 1994 and why computer_network suppliers like cisco Systems , SynOptics Communications , Cabletron Systems and Novell software show_up on lists of investment guru favorites . And that ' s why foreign investment in the United States is picking_up again . A study by the Arthur Andersen accounting_firm late last year reported that foreign companies are increasing their U.S. investments , seeking access to the world ' s largest market or the world ' s most efficient production capabilities . Daimler Benz ' decision to produce Mercedes in Alabama is a fresh example of that trend . Yet many analysts doubt such optimism , maintaining that the U.S. economy cannot grow without sharply higher interest_rates and inflation . But they are forgetting the effect of productivity increases . After more_than a decade of decline or slow growth , productivity has been growing 2.4 % a year since 1991 . That means the U.S. economy has achieved roughly $ 150 billion more in output with the same or less input of labor , energy , capital and natural_resources . It ' s a powerful concept . We have massive change in industry , but not mass unemployment . Joblessness in California is up near 10 % because of defense industry downsizing , but it ' s at 6.4 % nationally . Industry is working_at 83 % of capacity and there are places where skilled trades are already in tight supply . In specific numbers , economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley predicts 3 % real growth for the U.S. economy in 1994 and says there will be no more inflation than we have now -- 2.8 % . That means there will be no sudden or dramatic rises in interest_rates . &quot; My nervous guess , &quot; says Albert M . Wojnilower , senior economist of First Boston Investment Management , is that short-term interest_rates may rise from 3 % to 3.5 % , but not for another six months . &quot; Long-term bond yields will continue to fluctuate wildly , &quot; he says , &quot; but on balance should rise one-quarter to one-half of one_percent in 1994. &quot; California ' s economy will continue to lag . But toward the end of the year , it should pick_up , says economist Larry Kimbell of UCLA . And house prices could get firmer this summer , says Richard Diehl , who retired last year as chairman of H.F. Ahmanson , because the burden of bank-reclaimed housing now depressing real_estate markets will be absorbed by midyear . A still underestimated engine of California ' s economy is multimedia , the marriage of Silicon_Valley and Hollywood . The world of 500 TV channels -- whatever that may mean -- won ' t arrive in 1994 , but work is going_forward furiously on services for business , from sales programs on CD-ROM to video conferencing to ever more elaborate global communications . Hundreds of California firms large and small , from Disney to Knowledge / Adventure , are in the thick of this developing megabusiness . The outlook in traditional industries is firmly bullish . U.S. car and light truck sales could rise more_than 8 % , say analysts . Home sales and new home building will continue to benefit from low mortgage rates . This will be the year of the great health_care debate , with passage of legislation likely before the November congressional elections . Universal coverage and protection from loss of insurance due_to catastrophic_illness will be brought_in , but otherwise there will be few surprises . Changes in medical_care to favor efficiency and cost-consciousness are already proceeding throughout the U.S. system . Many industries , from chemicals and construction equipment to computers and engineering and environmental services , depend heavily on foreign markets , which will be both exciting and uncertain in 1994 . The stagnant economies of Western Europe and the recession-hit economy of Japan are just beginning the process of restructuring that has brought U.S. industry into the information age . So for the next few years , we can expect to see their companies downsizing and reorganizing -- probably with the aid of U.S. computer equipment . Interest_rates are already coming_down sharply in Europe , causing European stock_markets to rise . Japan is facing a profound restructuring to a more consumer-oriented society , and its stock_market will remain in some turmoil . Mexico ' s economy will grow strongly in 1994 , thanks partially to the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . And the other economies of Asia , including China and Hong Kong , will continue their rapid advance . Foreign markets are now bread_and_butter to the U.S. economy . If trade accounts are calculated correctly -- that is , if services such_as banking , legal and investment counseling , entertainment , travel and tourism are included -- one out of every four dollars in the U.S. economy is connected to foreign trade . In 1993 , with congressional passage of NAFTA and support for the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the American public gave its assent to the new global economy . In the same way , Americans have given assent to the information age in their acceptance of industrial restructuring over the last decade . It ' s a bold step -- but not a leap in the dark . History is_on the side of change . This year will see direct employment in U.S. manufacturing -- already down to 14 % of the work_force -- decline slightly again . But manufacturing output will continue to advance . The new jobs are related to information industries ( as in trucking and transportation needed for more efficient inventory systems ) and in financial and health services for an aging population saving for retirement , and in the multitude of tasks related to foreign trade . The U.S. economy is still in recovery . The boom is yet to come , says economist David Levy , who predicts a surge in high_technology exports to such countries as China and Argentina and a major swelling of orders for U.S. aircraft and power_plants later this decade . In 1994 , Americans broadly -- even we in California -- should begin to feel more confident about our future .</TEXT>
