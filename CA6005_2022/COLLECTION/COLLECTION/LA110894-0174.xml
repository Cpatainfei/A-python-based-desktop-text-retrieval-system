   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; DOCTOR ' S CORNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A trip to the doctor ' s office is usually limited to a discussion of whatever ails you -- if you ' re like most people . Neither doctors nor patients have much time to wax philosophical on other things one might do to promote good_health . So we decided to do this for you -- for free . We invited top health experts representing various specialties to give us their best tips for healthy living . Women ' s Health Dr. Anita Nelson , obstetrician-gynecologist , Women ' s Health_Care Programs , Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center , Torrance : * Preconception health is the wave of the future . Make certain you are in optimal health before you become pregnant to ensure the best outcome possible . Achieve appropriate weight , eat a balanced_diet , stop smoking and drinking and get a thorough health evaluation before conception . Folic acid supplements are also helpful . * Health maintenance beyond the childbearing years should include the crucial role that hormone replacement plays in prolonging a woman ' s life span and in improving the quality of her final years . Hormone replacement reduces osteoporosis , heart_attacks , Alzheimer ' s disease risk , and controls hot_flashes and wrinkles . * Themes throughout the years : Know yourself , participate in your own health_care ; do breast self-examination ; commit to a healthy lifestyle and avoid smoking ; exercise and control your weight , but avoid crash diets and excessive exercise ; take_control ; practice safe_sex , and don ' t become a victim of domestic violence . Men ' s Health Dr. Charles E . Shapiro , urologist , Kaiser-Permanente Medical_Center , Los Angeles : * Males in the 15- to 30-year-old category should be aware of their risk for testicular_cancer . It can be picked_up by doing frequent self-exam -- monthly , for example , in the shower . Know what &quot; normal &quot; feels_like so that you can detect any changes . * Good sexual functioning can be maintained throughout the life span . A prescription for good sex function in later ages is to have frequent intercourse when you ' re younger . You can ' t wear it out . * Prostate cancer is extremely common with age . But in older_age groups the vast majority of men who are found to have prostate cancer will die with it rather than from it . Therefore , the decision about treatment for prostate cancer must be individualized according to your state of health and the information your doctor provides you about your options . Prostate cancer is a real problem because it ' s difficult to identify how the disease will progress . Watchful waiting is a legitimate and reasonable option for many patients . Make yourself as well-informed as possible and take the time to think_about the advantages and disadvantages of each option available . In general , prostate cancer is not an emergency . Children ' s Health Dr. Barbara Korsch , professor of pediatrics at USC , attending pediatrician at Childrens Hospital , Los Angeles , specializing in child development and behavior , advises parents : * Trust yourself . You know your child . Don ' t be frightened by all_the advice out there . General rules do not apply to everyone . Parents know more about their children than anyone else . * Everyone has such high expectations for mothers . Nobody turns_into a saint just because they become a mother . You may do things when you are tired and angry that you regret , but your child will survive . * Take_care of yourself . Somebody has to be good to you if you are going_to be good to your child . Eyes Dr. Daniel Sigband , ophthalmologist in private practice in Huntington Beach and assistant clinical professor of ophthalmology at UC Irvine : * Eye safety is very important . Wear protective lenses , such_as safety goggles , when doing anything hazardous , whether it ' s on_the_job or around the house or even playing some sports , such_as racquetball . * Wear sunglasses that have been certified for protection against ultraviolet_light . Even young people should wear sunglasses . There is indirect_evidence that ultraviolet_light might produce cataracts and macular degeneration . * Tailor your vision care to your stage in life : -- Families have to be aware that they can go_to their pediatrician and have their child ' s vision screened . Many conditions can be caught , such_as amblyopia or lazy eye , preventing permanent vision loss . -- In early adulthood , continue to periodically see your eye-care practitioner . The need for glasses or contacts can and should be detected early . -- Age 40 is an excellent time to see an ophthalmologist for the first time to check for eye_diseases , cataracts , glaucoma or retinal diseases . -- Over age 50 , have ophthalmological examinations every two years . -- People with a family history of eye_diseases as well as people with diabetes or high_blood_pressure are at higher risk for eye_disease and should get regular examinations . African Americans are at higher risk of glaucoma . Teeth and Mouth Christine Dumas , dentist in Marina del Rey and spokeswoman for the California Dental Assn. : * Expect more from dentistry . Americans have raised their expectations for their overall health , but their dental-care expectations have lagged . People have a 1950s view of what happens when they go_to a dentist . A dentist now should check for oral cancer and jaw-joint problems , and do a periodontal exam and tooth-by-tooth evaluation . * A lot of Americans avoid the dentist because of their fears of pain . You should know that , in 1994 , you can expect to have dental_care done painlessly and comfortably . * Get regular dental_care . You are not healthy if you are not dentally healthy . People in Southern California exercise and eat right , but they think their mouth is not connected to the rest of their body . Look_for a dentist who is going_to teach you things to keep you healthy . * Watch who you kiss . Dental disease is transmittable . You can catch_it from someone else . Your loved one may never go_to the dentist while you go every three months , but his germs are jumping into your mouth . Skin Dr. Norman Brooks , dermatologist and director of the Skin_Cancer Medical_Center in Encino : * Wear sunscreens regularly and avoid excessive exposure to the sun . Although sunscreens protect against UV-B rays , they don ' t protect quite as well against UV-A rays , which are linked to melanoma . * Use an alpha-hydroxy product . This is a major breakthrough in skin_care . The main ingredient is glycolic_acid . It reverses sun damage , such_as the brown spots and rough areas that are common . They will disappear , and the skin looks better . * The skin itself is a reflection of the health of the internal body . Good nutrition , regular exercise , perhaps a vitamin supplement can make you healthier and make your skin healthier . Feet Dr. Carol Frey , USC assistant clinical professor of orthopedic surgery . Director of the foot and ankle program at Orthopedic Hospital , Los Angeles : * Buy shoes that fit and know when a shoe fits . Shoes are the only part of your wardrobe that can cause health_problems . Shop_at the end of the day or after exercise when your feet are at their biggest . There should be a half-inch space from the end of the longest toe to the shoe . Finally , shoes should be comfortable the moment you put them on . It ' s terrible advice when people say that shoes will stretch to fit . They only stretch because they have to . * Trim your toenails . You only need to trim them once every six to eight weeks . Trim them straight across , not curved like fingernails . And don ' t trim them too short . You should see a millimeter of skin when looking down at your toenails . * Exercise your feet . We don ' t really need shoes . The only reason we have to wear shoes is to protect ourselves from the human environment . But when you start wearing shoes , you lose strength in your feet , such_as the ability to move your toes and keep them in alignment . Walking barefoot on sand is a good exercise . Do the marble exercise ; pick_up 20 marbles a day with your toes . Or run your fingers through your toes and spread them apart . Dancers do a lot of these things . Heart Dr. David A . Ciraulo , cardiologist , Daniel Freeman Hospitals , Marina del Rey : * Don ' t smoke , consume a lot of animal_fat ( especially if your lipid blood_tests are abnormal ) or ignore a high_blood_pressure problem . * Do eat a more vegetarian diet and engage in regular exercise . As descendants of primates , and later , of hunting and gathering nomads , our bodies were designed to metabolize a high-fiber , high-starch , principally vegetarian diet , which was acquired by days of physically exhausting foraging . In the modern_world , however , a rich diet is brought_to us without physical_exertion . * Do derive pleasure from a more natural way of living . The modern urban environment is_full of intellectual and emotional demands that tend to drive our nervous_system to a state of frenetic overload . Type_A individuals will allow themselves to be driven by such stress , while Type Bs learn to master this environmental energy to serve their own interests . The latter behavior results in less cardiovascular illness . But no one will give_up the old lifestyle unless the new one is ultimately more fulfilling . * Aerobic exercise should be a joy , not a drudgery . Play racquetball with friends or take regular walks with your spouse . Choose markets and restaurants that feature fresh fruits and vegetables . Take time to create sensible meals and then enjoy them leisurely with the whole family . * Involve your friends and family in your new lifestyle . Make your life and theirs a sumptuous feast that all can savor from moment to moment , ignoring the fast-food , fast-lane imperatives of modern culture . Nutrition Evelyn Tribole , consulting nutritionist in Beverly Hills and staff nutritionist for &quot; Good_Morning America &quot; : * Remember : Occasional lapses from healthy eating are normal . One food , one snack , one meal , one day will not make or break the waistline . * Cut the fat where you don ' t miss it . For example , if you order a tuna sandwich , cut the mayonnaise on the bread . You won ' t miss it . * When you eat fat , sit and savor it . If it ' s worth having , make_it a worthwhile experience . You ' ll have a satisfying eating experience and will not be left wanting more . If you are eating a doughnut and are feeling guilty , you are not enjoying it and you may still end_up feeling deprived . Psyche Robert T . Scott , Ph.D. , psychologist , Tarzana , president of the Los Angeles County Psychological Assn . * Learn to manage and control stress . Did you know that three of the best-selling drugs in the country are used to treat stress-related illness ? That 80 % to 90 % of all visits to health-care professionals are a result of stress-related illness and issues ? That 70 % of all accidents are stress-related ? We need to take stress seriously . It ' s killing us . * Recognize the fact that you do have options and that you can change yourself or things in your environment so that stress doesn ' t get_the_best of you . When you are getting stressed out , ask yourself : &quot; Is it worth dying over ? &quot; Hang loose . Learn to meditate , take a yoga class , develop a fun hobby , learn guided imagery techniques , get a hot tub -- whatever it takes_to elicit the relaxation response in you . * Exercise your mind and body . Physical_exercise appears to be the most effective way of ventilating , or expressing , the stress response in a health-promoting manner . The physiological effects of exercise are talked_about a great_deal . But the psychological effects are also very powerful . The hormonal and neurochemical changes that take_place after exercise result in a powerful psychological enhancement of mood as well as improved self-esteem and an enhanced sense of control . * Exercise your mind and personality in the same way you exercise your body . That means trying new ways of being , testing new behaviors , continuing to grow -- getting_rid_of the psychological flab and strengthening weaker areas . * Learn to laugh and play . It may sound silly , but as adults we can learn a lot from children . They have a superb resiliency -- they ' re able to bounce_back so quickly . Oftentimes they go right into their play as a means to cope and release stress . Laughter and play are powerful and healing activities . Research in this area suggests that laughter releases healing chemicals and hormones into our bloodstream and promotes a healthy , positive psycho-physiological state of being . Recent research on happy , successful marriages points to the use of humor and play as key factors .</TEXT>
