   <HEADLINE> SHOPTALK ; NOW IS THE TIME TO START LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A GARDEN ; THE START-UP COSTS OF A VEGETABLE PLOT CAN BE AS LOW AS $ 30 TO $ 40 , DEPENDING_ON SIZE AND QUALITY OF EQUIPMENT YOU CHOOSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let ' s play a little game . It concerns New Year ' s resolutions . How many of you , at the start of the year , made_up your mind to exercise three times a week ? How many of you promised to get your taxes in on_time ? How many of you decided that this would be the year to start your own home vegetable_garden ? Well , you folks in the first two groups have already succeeded or failed , but for the would-be gardeners out there , guess what ? It ' s show time . Early spring is ideal for planting veggies . Although some of you will dive into the new hobby full steam ahead , many , undoubtedly , will proceed more cautiously . So , in an attempt to give you a gentle shove , we found_out what supplies you would need to begin a vegetable_garden , and then we shopped around . &quot; You ' ll need a shovel , a cultivator and a hoe , &quot; said Vera Villasenor , saleswoman and buyer at Ventura ' s Green_Thumb International . &quot; Those three are the basic things to start with. &quot; You ' ll also need some seeds or seedlings , soil amendments -- such_as mulch -- to enhance the quality of the dirt , and fertilizer . The start-up cost of a garden depends_on its size and on the quality of your tools . Tool prices vary greatly : It ' s a matter of determining how much you are willing to spend , and how high-quality you really need the supplies to be . It helps to shop_at a store that specializes in gardening , and where the salespeople can provide knowledgeable advice . Generally speaking , however , Villasenor said an average house garden , measuring 4 feet by 30 feet with two rows of vegetables , can cost as little as $ 30 to $ 40 to begin . Now , let ' s take a closer look_at some of the requisite supplies . we ' ll start with shovels . We chose the long-handled , rounded-point models . We found low-end Ames brand shovels for $ 13.88 at the Valley Ace Hardware_store in Santa Paula , $ 13.99 at Green_Thumb ( which has a tremendous selection ) and $ 14.98 at_Home Depot in Oxnard ( where the selection is also sizable ) . We also could have picked_up a True Temper brand long-handle shovel for $ 4.99 in the garden section of the Oxnard Target store . As for hoes , Home Depot was selling the American Made brand with wood handle and steel neck for $ 10.28. An Eagle brand with plastic ( and more fragile ) neck , was $ 3.47. At Green_Thumb , an Ames steel-neck hoe was $ 10.99 and the Ames plastic neck was $ 6.99. Target hoes were , again , $ 4.99. On to amendments . Not surprisingly , Green_Thumb and Home Depot had far and away the largest selections among the stores we visited . For the novice , it ' s pretty tough to tell one brand from another . When we asked_for amendment guidance at_Home Depot , we were referred to , among others , Scotts Vegetable Builder . A 2 1 / 2-pound box of the stuff was going_for $ 1.97 there and $ 2.69 at Green_Thumb . In the fertilizer arena , we looked , none too closely , at steer manure . Again , it ' s difficult for newcomers to tell the difference between brands . At Home Depot , we were led toward Vita Hume Composted steer manure , which sold for 50 cents for a cubic_foot . At Green_Thumb , Farmers brand steer manure was 99 cents for 1 1 / 2 cubic_feet or $ 1.49 for two cubic_feet . And at Target , one cubic_foot of Hyponex steer manure was 69 cents . As for the vegetables themselves , you can buy packets of seeds . Burpee seeds are an easy-to-find , popular local brand , going_for between 99 cents and $ 1.57 , depending_on the vegetable . Nurseries like Green_Thumb are apt to stock seeds from other companies as well , with prices varying just a tad . Or you can go_for the young vegetable plants themselves . They are generally sold in four-inch containers or slightly larger &quot; pony packs. &quot; We priced the pony packs : They were 89 cents each at Target and Home Depot , and $ 1.19 at Green_Thumb , which had , by far , the most substantial selection . Now , go_out and follow_through on your New Year ' s promise to yourself . Then again , you could just begin working_on next year ' s taxes .</TEXT>
