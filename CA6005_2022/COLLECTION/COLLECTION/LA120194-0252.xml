   <HEADLINE> KOHL , MITTERRAND PRESS POLITICAL SOLUTION IN BOSNIA ; DIPLOMACY : GERMAN , FRENCH LEADERS SUGGEST THEY MAY ACCEPT A SERBIAN CONFEDERATION . THEY VIEW BIHAC ASSAULT AS ' SHRILL WARNING. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France , meeting Wednesday for a final bilateral summit before the_French leader ' s retirement , put aside differences on Bosnia-Herzegovina and urged a negotiated settlement to the conflict there . Europe ' s elder_statesmen called_for a diplomatic solution based on &quot; just and balanced rights &quot; for all groups in the former Yugoslavia . In a printed statement , Kohl and Mitterrand said if the Bosnian Serbs accept the peace proposal drafted by the Contact Group of five nations , the two leaders will consider making &quot; adjustments &quot; in the plan . They apparently were referring to the idea raised by some U.S. and U.N. officials in recent days that would allow the Bosnian Serbs to form a confederation with Serbia , much as the Bosnian Croats and Muslims confederated with Croatia . Until recently , the United States and its European allies had refused to accept a Serbian confederation . &quot; It is one minute to 12 and we must all . . . do everything to pursue the peace plan , &quot; Kohl said at a joint news_conference . He said the French-German position will be set_forth at a meeting of the Contact Group -- the United States , Russia , France , Germany and Britain -- in Brussels on Friday . The continuing Serbian assault on the U.N. safe area of Bihac &quot; is the final and most shrill warning_signal for us , &quot; Kohl said . On Monday , Kohl ' s Christian Democratic Union called_for a lifting of the U.N. arms embargo to the Muslim-backed Bosnian government , a position opposed by France and Britain , which have thousands of peacekeeping troops on the ground . Kohl reiterated that he believed_in lifting the embargo in principle , but backed_off the stand_in favor of presenting a unified European position . &quot; Since we have no troops there , we restrain ourselves , &quot; Kohl said . &quot; The German position is to go_along with the alliance. &quot; The 78-year-old Mitterrand added that &quot; Europe ' s duty is to maintain the impression that there is clearly no solution other_than a political , negotiated one. &quot; The Contact Group ' s peace plan , which would give 51 % of Bosnia to a Muslim-Croat federation and 49 % to the Serbs , has been accepted by the Bosnian government but rejected by the Serbs , who would have to give_up territory they have won militarily . It does not allow_for a Serbian confederation . The United States , which views the Bosnian Serbs as the aggressors in the war , until now has been urging greater use of NATO air_power to pressure the Serbs to accept the plan . The Kohl-Mitterrand summit was their last before Mitterrand , who is dying of prostate cancer , steps_down in May . Although Kohl is a conservative and Mitterrand a Socialist , they have been allies on European unity over the last 12 years that both have been in power . But they have had their differences too , and in what seemed to be a quid_pro_quo , Kohl announced that he had invited the leaders of six Eastern European_countries -- Poland , Hungary , Slovakia , the Czech Republic , Romania and Bulgaria -- to make an appearance at a European Union summit in Essen next week . Germany has been far more eager than France to integrate the former Communist countries into the EU . Germany believes that integration will help protect its borders , while France fears diminished influence within the union as its center moves east .</TEXT>
