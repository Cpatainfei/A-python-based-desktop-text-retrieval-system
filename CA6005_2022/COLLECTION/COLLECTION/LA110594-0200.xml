   <HEADLINE> THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE ; IT HASN ' T BEEN GOOD YEAR FOR MEN IN STRIPED SHIRTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the zebra business , Jack Fette is the equivalent of a nice warm stall . As an NFL line_judge for 23 years , Fette survived playoffs , Super Bowls and even the Raiders . Now retired , he helps younger officials survive . Sitting in his office in Lees Summit , Mo. , he spends hours each day on the phone with referees , line_judges and back_judges . He counsels them on controversial calls , warns them about tricky rules , holds their hands as they head toward another turbulent weekend . One might say the current state of officiating in the NFL can be directly related to the activity on Fette ' s phone . He said he needs to install another line . Although Fette says things don ' t look that different , everyone else agrees it has become a war out there . Blown calls followed by blown tempers followed by some dumb lineman blowing his paycheck on a fine . Not since the end of instant replay , it seems , have the seven officials at each game been so criticized , so frustrated . . . and so dead wrong : -- In one corner of the country last weekend , San Diego Charger Coach Bobby Ross was twisting his head and screaming at the referee after a touchdown catch by Tony Martin became an incompleted pass because the crew missed his right foot brushing the ground . Even Sparky Anderson has never argued like that . -- In the middle of the country , defensive lineman Donald Evans of the New York Jets was getting thrown_out of a game after screaming at referee Bernie Kukar . None other_than the esteemed Ronnie Lott claimed that Evans was &quot; pushed &quot; by Kukar , exacerbating the incident . Why was Evans so mad ? No reason , really . The Jets were penalized 12 times and the Indianapolis Colts not once for the first time since 1976 . And an obviously poor spot after a fourth-down run cost the Jets a chance at a last-minute comeback . -- In a far corner of the country , the New York Giants were stunned by one of the worst calls of this or any season . In overtime against the Detroit Lions , the Lions ' Herman Moore caught a pass at the Giants ' 33 . After getting hit by Jarvis Williams , Moore clearly touched the ground with his knee , which should have ended the play . But no official blew his whistle and Moore wasn ' t tackled until he reached the seven-yard line . Jason Hanson then kicked a game-winning , 24-yard field_goal . Owners discussed these plays and others this week while roaming the hallways of a Chicago airport hotel during NFL meetings . Nobody wants to hire the officials full-time , nobody wants a return to instant replay in its previous form . . . but everybody agrees something must be done . &quot; I think the officiating can be better , &quot; said Carl Peterson , general_manager of the Kansas City Chiefs . Which bring us to four letters that could solve everything . U - S - F - L . Peterson , a former executive in the USFL , says the officiating could be improved by stealing a trick from his old league . Allow instant replay , but only twice a half for each team , by request of the coach , he says . If the call is proven to be wrong , it is overturned . If the call is upheld , the team loses a timeout or is assessed a five-yard penalty . &quot; These will continue to leave the game in the hands of the coaches , but make_sure important calls are made accurately , &quot; Peterson said . Speaking from the other side of the debate , former official Fette agreed that the old USFL system could work . &quot; By giving the coaches only a_couple_of challenges , we would n ' t kill so_much time , and we would n ' t put all_the pressure on the replay official to decide what gets reviewed , &quot; Fette said . &quot; I think that could work for everybody. &quot; Don ' t be surprised if support for this idea builds at next spring ' s owners ' meetings . League bosses who do not want a return to instant replay counter with the statistic that in the 113 games played this season , only 27 plays would have been reversed . Does 27 plays sounds like a lot to anybody else ? THE WORST In a season during which Jerry Seeman , director of officiating , has already phoned at least one team and profusely apologized for his officials , it was difficult picking only the five worst calls . Forgive us for the dozen or so that we left_out . 1 . Allowing a 103-yard punt return by the Rams ' Robert Bailey against the New Orleans Saints with several dozen players roaming the field . To think that the record books will be forever tainted with that play , which should have been a touchback because of offsetting penalties for all those men on the field . 2 . Allowing the Lions ' Moore to run_into field-goal range after he had fallen to the ground last Sunday . The loss that ensued might keep the Giants from the playoffs . George Young , Giant general_manager and co-chairman of the influential rules committee , is vehemently against instant replay . &quot; We ' re trying to decrease the probability of human error , but you don ' t cut_down on human error by adding more humans , &quot; Young said . 3 . Allowing Herschel Walker to score on a 38-yard touchdown pass even though he had clearly stepped_out of bounds before crossing the goal_line for the Philadelphia Eagles in a game against the Dallas Cowboys on Oct . 16 . The Eagles lost anyway , but won ' t they be thankful for those six points during playoff tiebreaker computations ? 4 . Charging Chris Calloway with a taunting violation late in the New York Giants ' early October game at New Orleans . The penalty cost the Giants a shot at a game-tying touchdown , and led to the first of five consecutive losses . OK , so Calloway pranced around a bit . That sort of call should never be made that late in a close game . When a rule is ambiguous , as this one is , officials should opt_for fairness first . 5 . Allowing Deion Sanders and Andre Rison to engage in a fistfight without throwing a flag . That $ 7 # 500 fine later assessed each player should have been split seven other ways . THE SAJAK DIVISION Don ' t laugh , but at least one influential league observer is planning to propose a new way to realign the divisions next year , and every two years after that . Place the names of each team in a giant bin , mix them up , then pull_out the names and assign them to different divisions . Do_it on national television in March . Make a big show out of it . Sell plenty of advertising . Bring in busloads of fans . Garner reams of media attention . The craziest thing about this idea is that it could work . You say this messes with the integrity of the current format ? What integrity ? The names of the divisions are already meaningless . When the Rams move , four of the five NFC West teams will be in the Central or Eastern time_zones . You say this messes with competitive balance ? We say it increases competitive balance . What better way to keep Seattle Seahawk fans and players interested than to assure them that in two years , they could be in a division with Indianapolis , New England , Cincinnati and the New York Jets ? You laugh . But you watch . POWER STRUGGLE Quietly , a dispute has broken_out between the two most powerful forces in the league . The combatants : Jerry Jones , owner of the Dallas Cowboys , and Don Shula , coach of the Miami Dolphins . The issue : The reputation of Shula ' s son , Dave , coach of the Cincinnati Bengals . Last week , Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer compared the Bengals to Iowa State . He was using the analogy to warn his team that an unlikely foe could defeat them . Switzer certainly didn ' t mean any offense to Dave Shula . There is more_than a slight chance that Switzer didn ' t even know who Dave Shula was . Maybe he had one of his frequent flashbacks and actually thought the Bengals were Iowa State . More_than once this year , he has referred to his team as &quot; the Sooners. &quot; But Dave didn ' t see it that way . He took it personally and after his team had nearly upset the Cowboys before losing , 23-20 , confronted Switzer at midfield . &quot; You can stick that Iowa State , &quot; David told him . Switzer was initially upset by the remark , but later said that Dave ' s behavior didn ' t bother him because , &quot; Some of my assistants told me that when David was coaching here , he was pretty immature. &quot; Guess who is mad now . &quot; Barry doesn ' t know David and doesn ' t have a clue what he ' s talking_about , &quot; Don Shula said of the incident . This is the same Shula who controls the league ' s rules committee and who often acts like a 31st owner . But Jones , a man who pulls more strings in this league than almost anyone but the commissioner , is openly backing Switzer . &quot; From Barry ' s perspective , I can understand where he was coming from , &quot; Jones said . &quot; What he was really saying was that Iowa State used to have a chance to beat Oklahoma. &quot; Jones also complimented Dave Shula during the interview , but the lines have been drawn . The old money is_on Shula . But the smart_money is_on Jones . PARTING BLAST Amid this season ' s controversies over scoring and injuries and realignment , somebody man enough to tackle a real issue has finally been found . Wade Phillips , coach of the Denver Broncos , has appealed_to the NFL to make the San Diego Chargers get_rid_of their end-zone cannon , the one that has fired after every score for the last 33 years . Phillips was scared out his socks by the cannon a_couple_of weeks ago -- as if his Broncos had never before given_up a score in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium -- and so he complained . The league , of course , told Phillips to get lost . So now he ' s planning retaliation . &quot; If they can do_it , so can we , &quot; he told reporters . &quot; We can have bombs and hand_grenades and fireworks going_off in the end zone . We can have about 10 of them blowing_up over their heads. &quot; Said Ron Dixon , president of San Diego Fireworks and owner and operator of the cannon : &quot; I can ' t for the life of me figure_out what his problem is . I remember in the late ' 60s or early ' 70s , a coach named Bum Phillips came_in here with little Wade running_around on his daddy ' s arm . This should come as no revelation to him. &quot; QUICK HITTERS * THE THROWBACK BOWL , AN EPILOGUE : While many of this nation ' s football fans were gathered around office water_coolers Tuesday , recalling the wonders of that muddy Monday night_game between the Green_Bay Packers and Chicago Bears , a Packer employee was fretting . According to Gordon ( Red ) Batty , the club ' s equipment manager , all_of the players ' shoes , all_of the coach ' s shoes , all_of the footballs and many of the Throwback uniforms and pants were ruined in the Soldier Field muck . Batty said the game cost the Packers about $ 15 # 000 . Best $ 15 # 000 they ' ll ever spend , if you ask us . * IS THAT LIKE A FEARSOME FOURSOME ? When asked to describe the NFL ' s fifth-ranked rushing defense , Reuben Davis of the San Diego Chargers said , &quot; We ' re a bunch of ballroom , brawling brothers. &quot; * HOW ABOUT THIS QUESTION : WHEN ARE YOU RETIRING FROM COACHING ? When asked to evaluate his team ' s performance after last week ' s 35-15 loss to the San Diego Chargers , Seattle Seahawk Coach Tom Flores snapped , &quot; What kind of question is that ? &quot; * DOESN ' T ANYBODY JUST BOO ANYMORE ? While walking past the Tampa Stadium stands after his team ' s 36-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings last week , Buccaneer Coach Sam Wyche was hit with a flying binoculars case . With the binoculars inside . Another fan , apparently angry at both the coach and the weather , pelted Wyche with his rain slicker . * SO THERE : For all you coaches who have complained that the new kickoff rule gives the receiving team an unfair advantage during overtime -- Wade Phillips , are you listening ? -- check_out this stat : In only three of eight overtime games has the team touching the ball first scored on that possession . And those three possessions started on the offense ' s 22 , 23 and 29-yard lines . * SAY IT AIN ' T SO : As part of the city of San Francisco ' s $ 26-million renovation of Candlestick Park for the 1999 Super Bowl , officials may sell the name &quot; Candlestick &quot; to a big corporation , which could then attach its own name to the stadium . And you thought Midwesterners were mad when Indianapolis ' Hoosier Dome became the RCA Dome . * HONESTY , IT ' S SUCH A LOVELY WORD : There is a reason Houston Oiler officials try to shield owner Bud Adams from the media . That became clear in the lobby of a Chicago airport hotel last week during the NFL owners ' meetings . Adams needed only a_few sentences to pull the rug from under his team , which is struggling with a 1-7 record . Adams on his coaching staff : &quot; I will make changes if the players start to lose confidence and give_up . I ' m going_to blame the staff for that , and I will think_about doing something . You can ' t sit around and let that continue. &quot; Adams on his offense : &quot; I just don ' t think the run-and-shoot offense works anymore . Teams are able to defense it now . They have figured_out what to do against it . There ' s no secret to what we are doing . We can ' t do the same things we did_in the past . We don ' t have the personnel to run it. &quot; Quarterback Cody Carlson later told reporters : &quot; I have a problem with the way it was handled . To put the blame on one or two individuals is not right and it ' s not fair . ( It ) sounded to me like ( Adams is ) throwing_in the towel. &quot; Added assistant coach Kevin Gilbride : &quot; He signs the checks , so he can say what he wants to say , but that doesn ' t mean he ' s right. &quot; Good_night , Jack Pardee . Good_night , Kevin . Good_night , Cody . In February , new coach Jeff Fisher will have his hands full .</TEXT>
