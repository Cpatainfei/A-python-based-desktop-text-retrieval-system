   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; LIMITED THRILLS IN ' MORTAL FEAR '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a medical thriller , &quot; Mortal Fear &quot; is about as entertaining as a clogged artery . The movie , adapted from Robin Cook ' s novel about the perils of gene-tampering , expires in the first_half hour from a lack of narrative oxygen . The rest of the production , starring Joanna Kearns as a tireless physician tracking_down mysterious deaths in a Boston hospital , is claustrophobic . When the plot gets murky , director Larry Shaw ( from a scenario by Rob Gilmer and Roger Young ) tends to rely_on unnerving close-ups of needle injections . But at least the thematic aspirations are current : managed health_care , of all things , and genetic_engineering ( in this case , an age reversal gene that unfortunately only ages ) . The movie foolishly tries to enliven events with a romance between Kearns and the hospital administrator ( Gregory Harrison ) that ' s devoid_of chemistry , a subplot about a forlorn stripper ( Katherine LaNasa ) and weird moments with a cheerful coroner ( Rebecca Schull ) . -- R.L. * &quot; Mortal Fear &quot; airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on NBC ( Channels 4 , 36 and 39 ) .
