   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 5 DAYS AND COUNTING ; THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD ; GREATER STAKES , STRICTER EMPHASIS ON RULES INTERPRETATION HAVE PLACED A HEAVIER BURDEN ON CUP REFEREES THAN EVER BEFORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was , without question , the most blatant piece of cheating in the history of international soccer . But the referee missed it . The strange thing is , the incident need never have happened . If Argentina ' s Diego Maradona had been a sportsman , he would not have punched the ball into the net with his fist and later claimed it was &quot; the hand of God. &quot; And if English soccer officials had not been so closed-minded , they would not have objected to having a Brazilian referee officiate England ' s 1986 World Cup quarterfinal match against Argentina in Mexico_City . But Maradona is not a sportsman . A once-gifted athlete , yes , but not a sportsman . And English soccer officials are notoriously insular . They feared a Brazilian would favor the_Argentines , as fellow South_Americans , and so Ali Ben Naceur of Tunisia was assigned by FIFA to referee the match . To be fair to Ben Naceur , not many in the crowd of 114 # 580 at Azteca Stadium saw the foul . England goalkeeper Peter Shilton and Maradona both leaped to reach a high ball -- Shilton to punch it away and Maradona to head it into the net . Maradona got there first , but as Shilton and the_English defenders immediately insisted and as television replays later confirmed , the_Argentine captain used his clenched right fist to drive the ball into the net . Despite English protests , the goal stood and Argentina went_on to win the game , 2-1 , and eventually the World Cup . Pele , commenting on the affair later , said : &quot; It is certain that if the_Argentines or Uruguayans had been in the same position as the_English , they would have trampled the referee. &quot; Instead , all that happened to Ben Naceur was that he entered the World Cup history books as the official who blew the call . It is the nightmare scenario that haunts all 24 referees selected to officiate this summer ' s World Cup . There seldom has been a World Cup entirely free_of refereeing controversy , and the problems faced by &quot; the men in black &quot; have ranged from the frightening to the absurd . For instance , in the first World Cup , in Uruguay in 1930 , police had to rush onto the field to separate players when fighting broke_out between Argentina and Chile . In another game , between Romania and Peru , play became so violent that Chilean referee Alberto Warken was forced to eject Mario De Las Casas , Peru ' s captain . De Las Casas thus gained the unwanted distinction of becoming the first player to be thrown_out of a World Cup game . Even the championship match that year was not free_of controversy , and Belgian referee Jean Langenus had to cope_with the ludicrous demands by both the Uruguayans and Argentines that the ball used in the final come from their country . To solve the dilemma , a different ball was used in each half . Today ' s referees have to be ready to deal with far more difficult problems . As the game has grown , so too have the pressures . Much more is at stake for the teams and the players ; the prestige of winning is the same , but the financial rewards are incomparably greater . As a result , there is more gamesmanship involved . Perhaps cheating would be a better word . Players feign injury to waste time or to get an opponent in_trouble . Players take dives in the penalty area in the hope of drawing a penalty kick . Players use their hands illegally . They hold , they push , they spit , they fight . One graphic illustration of how the sport has changed can be seen in the number of penalty kicks awarded in World Cup play . There were 55 in the first 10 tournaments between 1930 and 1974 . But in the four since , 58 have been given . On top of all this , today ' s game is played_at a far greater speed than in years past . The players are_better prepared and are perhaps fitter than their counterparts from the past , because of better training methods and better diets . All of which means the referees , who sometimes are twice the age of the players , have to be fitter too . And more alert . Belatedly , FIFA has recognized this and is acting to rid referees of the stereotyped image of being out of shape and out of touch . Of course , the men in the middle , as they are known , have always been the targets of criticism , some of it justified . But now they are subjected_to far more second-guessing than ever before . The eye of the television_camera is everywhere , and instant replay , slow_motion and videotaping give sportswriters and fans the opportunity to dissect every play . FIFA is trying to standardize refereeing , at least at the highest level in world and continental championships , but it is no small challenge . Rules are rules , but their interpretation varies . European referees , for example , allow a greater degree of physical contact , that is to say , stronger tackles and shoulder charges , than their South_American counterparts . Other differences also exist . On the soccer field , the referee is both judge and jury . His decision is what matters . He has two linesmen but they only make calls_on offside and out-of-bounds plays , and even those calls can be overruled . What might appear from the stands to be a clear foul is not necessarily what the referee sees . He has a different angle and might invoke the advantage rule or spot another infraction unseen by more distant viewers . The seven most important words in the rules of soccer , it has been pointed_out , are these : &quot; If in the opinion of the referee . . . &quot; No one else ' s opinion matters ; the referee has total control . During the most recent World Cup , in Italy in 1990 , referees received more criticism than perhaps ever before . Unfortunately , much of it was justified . The referees had been ordered by FIFA President Joao Havelange to crack_down on violent play , under threat of being sent home if they did not . The result was chaos . Some referees punished the most innocuous of fouls , others ignored blatant fouls . Communication between referees and their linesmen was poor . By the end of the tournament , a record 170 yellow cards had been issued and 16 players had been tossed_out of games , including Argentina ' s Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti , who became the first players to be red-carded in the championship final . The abiding image of Italia ' 90 , at least from the officiating standpoint , is of referee Edgardo Codesal Mendez of Mexico being surrounded and jostled by angry Argentine players , including Maradona , who did or said enough to be given a yellow card . It is not an image FIFA is proud_of , and world soccer ' s governing body has set_out to change it in this summer ' s tournament . Here are some of the changes : -- The maximum age of the participating referees has been fixed at 45 , with the intention of lowering it in the future . -- Instead of using referees as linesmen , this World Cup will be officiated by 24 referees and 24 specialist linesmen . -- The &quot; man-in-black &quot; phrase is no longer applicable . Instead of wearing all-black uniforms , referees will be sporting fuchsia , silver or yellow shirts . &quot; They are fairly conservative but more attractive than the traditional black jerseys , &quot; said Scotland ' s David Will , chairman of FIFA ' s referees committee . &quot; The image of referees is gradually changing , and we think this is part of the modernization of the image. &quot; -- All referees and linesmen will be based in Dallas during the tournament and will travel_to matches in teams of four , grouped according to language compatibility when possible . &quot; You may rest assured that we will see better control of matches in 1994 , &quot; Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , FIFA ' s general secretary , said last December in Las Vegas . Blatter , who is from Switzerland , visited the United States again last March when all_of the referees underwent a series of physical and written tests and attended seminars on rules interpretation . &quot; Very precise instructions have been given , principally about changes in emphasis , &quot; Will said . &quot; We talked_about changes in the psychological approach of referees and linesmen to soccer so that , hopefully , in the World Cup we shall see attacking soccer . &quot; We have tried , by changing the psychology of the referees , to take_away the advantage from defenders and give it to the forwards. &quot; One of the new interpretations of the rules will be to consider tackles from behind as serious fouls . &quot; If it is serious foul_play , it is automatically an expulsion , &quot; Blatter said . &quot; If there is a tackle from behind , it must be a red card . It cannot be a yellow card. &quot; Yellow cards , or cautions , also will be given to players who fake being fouled by taking a dive , Blatter said . Whether all these changes will result in more open and attacking play , rather than the defensive doldrums that characterized the 1990 tournament , remains to be seen . An effort has been made but it will still be up_to the referees to make the calls . &quot; The man in black will not be in black any longer , &quot; Blatter said , &quot; but he will still be in charge. &quot; World Cup Referees These are the 24 referees for the 52 matches of the 1994 World Cup .
