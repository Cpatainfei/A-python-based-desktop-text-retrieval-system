   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA JOINS NATO ' PEACE PARTNERSHIP '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid solemn vows to avoid the errors of history , the principal enemies of the Cold_War -- Russia and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization -- pledged themselves Wednesday to &quot; a far-reaching cooperative relationship &quot; in defense and security matters . The vows came as Russia joined the alliance ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program , ending months of uncertainty . When Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev finally signed the program ' s framework document at an official ceremony here , it was welcomed as a major event . &quot; This is a defining moment in shaping the security of our continent , &quot; declared NATO Deputy Secretary_General Sergio Balanzino . &quot; We must_not repeat the mistakes of Europe ' s past . Our main objective remains a new Euro-Atlantic order of security with the active participation of Russia. &quot; Speaking in Washington , President Clinton also hailed the accord ' s signing , saying , &quot; Today Russia took an important step to help shape a safer and more peaceful post-Cold War world. &quot; Kozyrev ' s trip to NATO headquarters here came just two weeks after Moscow entered a cooperative agreement with the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group of 24 rich countries -- and on the eve of Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s scheduled signing of an important economic and political accord with the 12-nation European Union . The Russia-NATO cooperation is seen as the most important element of this larger , intensive diplomatic effort aimed at binding Moscow firmly into the community of democratic nations . The severe economic turmoil unleashed by Russia ' s free-market reforms , coupled with appeals by ultranationalists such_as Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky for Russia to sever its Western ties , have raised fears that Moscow might once again be tempted to turn its back on the West and go its own way . &quot; Today , we are taking another decisive step toward banishing Europe ' s historic divisions , &quot; declared Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who witnessed the signing . He met later with Kozyrev , and at a news_conference , the two gave the appearance of wanting to work closely on global issues , including North_Korea and the continued search for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Russia ' s decision to join the Partnership for Peace program commits Moscow to work closely with NATO in key military areas , including planning , training and exercises for possible joint peacekeeping missions . Moscow and its former archfoe also issued a statement after the signing ceremony , stating they had agreed to pursue &quot; a broad , enhanced dialogue , &quot; with political consultations and information-sharing on important security matters . Such a written statement was seen as a significant concession to Moscow , which had fought hard to be granted a special status by NATO -- something the Russians believed essential for the biggest , most powerful country to emerge out of the former Soviet empire and the nation expected to become the sole custodian of the Soviet nuclear deterrent . In the course of the partnership negotiations , Moscow had initially sought a direct voice in NATO decision-making . When that failed , it pushed hard for a formal consultative role before finally settling for the looser formula of &quot; political consultations , as appropriate , on issues of common concern. &quot; NATO , eager to engage Moscow but not to be swallowed in the process , tried to avoid a statement of any kind that defined the political relationship in writing . Two weeks ago , at a meeting of foreign_ministers from NATO and most of the former Warsaw Pact countries in Istanbul , Turkey , the Russians held_up agreement on a final communique for more_than five hours by insisting on minor wording changes , apparently to show their displeasure with terms offered under the partnership program . None of that ill_will was visible Wednesday . Russia is the 21st formerly neutral or Soviet Bloc nation to join the partnership program , an idea conceived by the Clinton_Administration to offer closer cooperation , but not full membership and the security guarantees that go_with it , to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe . Some of these countries , such_as Poland and the Baltic_states , expressed concern that a strong Russia-NATO accord could lead to another division of Europe into spheres_of_influence similar to the Cold_War division agreed to at the Black_Sea resort of Yalta in early 1945 by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin , President Franklin D . Roosevelt and British Prime_Minister Winston Churchill . &quot; Since we strictly exclude any idea of zones of influence , such a relationship has nothing to do with some kind of NATO-Russia condominium or a Yalta II , &quot; said Balanzino . For many at NATO headquarters who had spent their careers working_up defenses against Moscow ' s formidable military might , it was difficult to absorb what actually was unfolding before them . Kozyrev echoed those sentiments , saying , &quot; Things that were unthinkable two years ago have now become virtually a routine matter in bilateral cooperation and military exchanges. &quot; At a separate news_conference at the Russian Embassy on Wednesday afternoon , Christopher said he and Kozyrev had developed &quot; a common approach &quot; toward a U.N. resolution for sanctions against North_Korea , if Pyongyang continued to flout international controls on its nuclear program . Christopher said the United States and Russia were also continuing to work closely to end the Bosnian war . He said that talks among American , Russian and EU officials were advancing and that their working_group would meet again next Thursday to agree on incentives and consequences to entice the warring parties to accept an imposed settlement .
