   <HEADLINE> PLAN TO EXPAND MEDICARE SPARKS HEALTH SKIRMISH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the controversy over health_care reform focused largely on universal coverage and employer mandates , a little-noticed proposal that would dramatically expand Medicare is emerging as a potential congressional time_bomb . The complex health_care bill being assembled by the House Democratic leadership contains a provision that would cover millions of uninsured Americans by creating a new &quot; Medicare Part C &quot; program . The plan , endorsed earlier by the House Ways and Means Committee , is intended as an alternative to the mandatory health_care alliances proposed by President Clinton to cover unemployed Americans , part-time or seasonal workers , independent contractors and others who would not be eligible for employer-paid benefits . Initially overlooked amid the clamor over universal coverage and employer mandates , Part C is now provoking a behind-the- scenes brawl among competing interest_groups and their allies in Congress . &quot; There ' s going_to be a big fight and we ' ll be in the midst of it , &quot; said Dick Davidson , head of the 5 # 000-member American Hospital Assn . The escalating dispute may be one reason that House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) missed a self-imposed deadline for producing a bill by Friday for House debate . Although the wrangling over the proposal is continuing , Part C will be a central element of the Gephardt bill , said Rep . Sam Gibbons ( D-Fla. ) , acting chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . &quot; It ' s a done deal , &quot; he said in an interview Friday . Critics say the proposed program would be another big-government , budget-busting social program but backers hail it as the logical expansion of a program that is working well for 37 million elderly and disabled Americans . The skirmishing broke_into the open Friday with a new advertising_campaign by the influential Health_Insurance Assn . of America , which attacked Part C as potentially &quot; the largest entitlement program in history &quot; and one that its president , Willis D . Gradison Jr. , predicted would lead to &quot; massive tax increases. &quot; Backers of Part C dispute such assertions , saying that the proposal is the most feasible way to reach universal coverage even if Congress imposes a requirement that employers pay_for a portion of their workers ' health_insurance . &quot; Even with an employer mandate , you ' ve got_to have a way to deal with all_the people who are not connected to the work_force , &quot; Rep . Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) , the chief congressional advocate of a government-run single-payer system , said in an interview Friday . It is unclear how -- or whether -- a health_care bill being crafted by Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) for debate in the upper chamber would cover seasonal workers , independent contractors , part-timers and dependents of workers . &quot; The private insurance industry has never been able to serve that market . And when they do , it ' s at such an exorbitant price that nobody can afford it , &quot; Gibbons said . The notion of expanding Medicare to cover the uninsured is not new . Several years ago , it was proposed by the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health_Care , better known as the Pepper Commission after its chairman , the late Rep . Claude Pepper ( D-Fla. ) . The idea also has the support of the influential American Assn . of Retired Persons , whose members are_well satisfied with Medicare . As a way to reach universal coverage , the President originally proposed pooling most consumers into regional cooperatives that would buy insurance for members at less-expensive group rates , with the needy receiving government subsidies . As the debate evolved , Part C emerged in a bill by the House Ways and Means health subcommittee chaired by Rep . Pete Stark ( D-Hayward ) . It was then adopted by the full committee and Gephardt now has incorporated the proposal into his House leadership bill . The price_tag of Part C is difficult to determine because it depends_on key details that are not yet known , such_as the scope of a benefits package and eligibility requirements . And , as with much else in the health_care debate , what may be appealing about Part C to some is precisely what makes_it unattractive to others . Sen . David Durenberger ( R-Minn. ) , an influential voice on health_care issues , has derided the proposal as &quot; just a back-door single-payer plan. &quot; The program would create , in_essence , a new &quot; fee-for-service &quot; arrangement , like Medicare , in which beneficiaries may go_to any provider they choose . But that approach flies in the face of a nationwide trend toward managed-care systems in which consumer choice is limited . &quot; Part C is like a dinosaur . It perpetuates all_the things wrong with the current system , &quot; Davidson said . Part C insurance could be 20 % cheaper than a comparable private insurance plan , according to McDermott . But the problem is that Medicare already pays providers at below-market rates , thus forcing them to recoup their losses by upping fees for insured patients -- one major reason for overall escalating health_care costs . Part C would accelerate such &quot; cost-shifting , &quot; Gradison said . And because Part C coverage would be likely to cost less than private insurance plans , many employers , especially small businesses , would channel workers into the program , said Richard I . Smith , health policy director for the Assn . of Private Pension and Welfare Plans . &quot; We hate Part C , &quot; he said . &quot; All it does is cut_prices and shifts costs to private payers. &quot; But &quot; if Part C works , &quot; McDermott said , &quot; the private insurers will be really threatened. &quot; The Part C debate emerged as the escalating struggle to influence public_opinion before Congress approaches its climatic health_care debate in the coming weeks .</TEXT>
