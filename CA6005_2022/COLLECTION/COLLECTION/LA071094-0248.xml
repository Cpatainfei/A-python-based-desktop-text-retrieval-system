   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : QUARTERFINALS ; ROMANIA HOLDING_UP WELL ; SOCCER : CONTROLLED APPROACH GIVES TEAM HEALTHY CHANCE AGAINST SWEDEN , WHICH COULD SUFFER ON DEFENSE BECAUSE OF INJURIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is a team that has been described in terms generally reserved for an especially cranky rodeo bull : tempestuous , emotional , unpredictable , dangerous . Romania , a team of self-described hotheads expected to self-destruct , has instead been a marvel of smooth deportment and professional focus -- an experimental approach for the Romanians that has borne such sweet fruit , a place in the World Cup quarterfinals . Romania , which had been considered a failure during the last World Cup because of its performance in the face of high expectations , will play Sweden today at Stanford Stadium . The winner of today ' s game will play Brazil on Wednesday at the Rose Bowl in one of two semifinal games . Romania ' s successful run largely has been credited to its most bullish player , the highly volatile Gheorghe Hagi . Hagi has overcome moody and indifferent play to lead Romania with three goals and three assists . Few have questioned Hagi ' s talent , but many have questioned his effort . His yeoman ' s work during this World Cup might serve to forever ( or , until the Italian league begins ) rid Hagi of that reputation . &quot; Hagi has proven to be among the best players in the tournament , &quot; Sweden Coach Tommy Svensson said . &quot; I knew he was a strong player before . But I have never seen him work this hard. &quot; For his part , Hagi ' s performance has not surprised him . &quot; I know my value to the team and how well I would play , &quot; Hagi said . &quot; I knew I would play well in the tournament. &quot; Hagi has not done_it alone . He teams with Ilie Dumitrescu on a deadly give-and-go the two learned as teammates at Steaua Bucharest . The combination will become more dangerous with the addition of high-scoring Florin Raducioiu , who had been serving a one-game suspension . Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu would not discuss his lineup Saturday , except to say he expected to play many of the same players who played in the opener against Colombia . The worst possible scenario for Sweden is likely to present itself -- team captain Jonas Thern is not expected to play . The midfielder suffered a knee sprain against Saudi_Arabia last week and Svensson does not usually allow players who are not fully fit to play . Thern , who plays for Napoli in the Italian league , is considered Sweden ' s best player in a decade and provides his team with an emotional anchor . Said one Swedish soccer writer : &quot; There is no hope for Sweden if Thern does not play. &quot; Also doubtful is defender Joachim Bjorklund , who has a groin pull . But both the defense and the midfield will be bolstered by Stefan Schwarz , whom many consider to be the best defensive midfielder in the tournament . If Romania relies_on counterattacking , as it has in four previous games , Sweden will be ready , having beaten the Saudis , 3-1 ; a game in which Romania successfully handled a relentless Saudi counterattack . &quot; It ' s more dangerous than Saudi_Arabia ' s because they don ' t go_to counter at every moment , &quot; Svensson said . &quot; They wait until they see they have the opportunity . If not , they keep the ball in their possession and they defend with nine or 10 men . We must be careful when we go_to attack. &quot; On the attack , Sweden has many potent weapons . Martin Dahlin has scored four goals in three games and Kennet Andersson has three in four games . Andersson , the striker , has been something of a surprise , but Dahlin has not . He scored seven goals in Sweden ' s nine qualifying games and has distinguished himself in this tournament with his assurance with the ball and in front of the net . In Sweden , where humility is prized above all other virtues , Dahlin ' s confidence is sometimes viewed_as being arrogant . He does not agree . &quot; Sweden is the only country where it is considered a bad characteristic to be sure of yourself , &quot; Dahlin said before the World Cup . &quot; Why should we always be ashamed of what we can do ? Why should we not instead be proud ? &quot;</TEXT>
