   <HEADLINE> SLAM DREAM IS SLAMMED BY COURIER ; FRENCH OPEN : SAMPRAS , SEEKING TO WIN FOURTH CONSECUTIVE GRAND_SLAM EVENT , LOSES IN QUARTERFINALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Sampras ' quest to make tennis history was laid_to_rest Tuesday on the parched red_clay of Roland Garros Stadium , where the harder the world ' s top-ranked player hit the ball , the harder he fell . Attempting to become the first man in 25 years to win four consecutive Grand_Slam tournaments , Sampras misplayed the big points in a 6-4 , 5-7 , 6-4 , 6-4 loss to Jim Courier in the quarterfinals of the_French Open . In a repeat of last year ' s five-set final , Courier will play Sergi Bruguera of Spain in Friday ' s semifinals . The sixth-seeded Bruguera , who has yet to lose a set , rolled past No . 4 Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine , 6-3 , 6-2 , 7-5 , in the quarterfinals . Courier has a 4-1 record against Bruguera , the only loss coming here in last year ' s title match . Courier ' s record against Sampras had been dismal . With a chance to join Don Budge and Rod Laver as the only men to hold all_the major titles simultaneously , Sampras was hoping for a breakthrough this week after losing in the quarterfinals here the previous two years . Instead , he lost for the first time in 26 Grand_Slam matches , giving a performance that if not quite lackluster , was definitely lacking . &quot; I ' m kind of down and disappointed , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; To win four in a row would have been something that would have been written_about for years. &quot; Courier , who had not defeated Sampras in 18 months , arrived on Center Court displaying the same dogged determination that had earned him French Open titles in 1991 and ' 92 . And he could not have been more pleased when Sampras played tentatively , content to stand on the baseline and bang away . Big mistake . Although Sampras is capable of powerful ground_strokes , he is less effective on the clay than Courier . Both players agreed that the surface made a difference , although the first summer-like weather in nine days of action made the courts quicker , which could have allowed Sampras to use his devastating serve-and-volley game . But with his first serve deserting him , Sampras tried to compensate with big forehands , and that ' s Courier ' s forte . &quot; I was in a lot more rallies and I was able to be the dictator rather than being the person dictated to , &quot; Courier said . Although Sampras had lost only twice this year , he was not necessarily the favorite . Courier has a 25-1 record at Roland Garros since 1991 and is_on course to reach the final for the fourth consecutive year . His play against Sampras could be one of those moments that turns a player ' s career . Once the world ' s No . 1 player , Courier has struggled for the past year as his intensity dropped along with his interest . &quot; It ' s certainly a good one for my head , &quot; Courier said . &quot; It has been a long_time since I have won a big match in a big tournament like this against a top player. &quot; Although neither player could find a comfortable rhythm at the start , Courier looked the more confident . And Sampras seemed to spend more time fidgeting with his rackets than trying to find a way to solve his opponent ' s shots . Sampras had seven new rackets for the match , and because of the warm weather , the string tension was soft . So , Sampras kept sending the rackets to the locker_room to have the tension adjusted . It was not racket tension that kept the match close , however . Sampras seemed to gain confidence by saving two break points that would have given Courier a 4-1 lead in the second set . Sampras broke service for the first time in the next game when Courier double-faulted and suddenly took command by tying the score . But in the third set , his timidity returned . Then the match seemed to turn_on the ninth game . Sampras took a 40-15 lead before Courier fought_back . When Sampras double-faulted on game point , Courier saw an opening . He won the game on the second break point when Sampras hit a half-volley into the net , then served out the set with an ace on set_point . Sampras was not through , however . He started hitting the ball more crisply in the fourth set and looked as if he would rally . But in the seventh game , with Sampras serving to go_ahead , 4-3 , he double-faulted on game point again . Sampras saved three break points but hit a forehand long on the fourth and was broken . &quot; If we were to do_it all_over again , I ' d come_in more , play serve-and-volley more , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; The clay limited my serve and helped his forehand . . . . But I can win here one year . I really believe that. &quot;</TEXT>
