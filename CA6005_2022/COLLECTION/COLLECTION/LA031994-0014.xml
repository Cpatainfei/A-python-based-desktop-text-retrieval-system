   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE TO REVIEW CHINA POLICY ; ASIA : SECRETARY OF STATE CALLS TOP-LEVEL MEETING TO DETERMINE WHETHER U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE TOUGH HUMAN_RIGHTS STAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of his turbulent Beijing visit , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher has asked senior American officials to meet early next week to review U.S.-China policy and determine whether President Clinton and his Administration will continue to support a tough human_rights stand . In essence , one senior State_Department official said Friday , Christopher will ask , &quot; Do I have any soldiers marching with me on China ? &quot; State_Department officials said it will be up_to the President to decide where the balance should be struck between confronting China over human_rights abuses , on the one hand , and advancing U.S. commercial and strategic interests by improving ties with Beijing , on the other . The meeting , which will include Christopher and other Cabinet-level officials , is the first hint that the Administration may be about to shift course on China policy . But another senior State_Department official predicted that there will be no major changes . &quot; The domestic divisions ( on China policy ) aren ' t helping , &quot; this official conceded , adding : &quot; The President is not going_to go_back_on his commitments . This is important in terms of his credibility around the world. &quot; Christopher has sought to carry_out Clinton ' s May , 1993 , executive order , which requires China to show &quot; overall , significant progress &quot; on human_rights if it wants any extension of its low-tariff trade benefits after they expire in July . But the order itself and the tough stance on human_rights flowing_from it have been deeply unpopular with other Administration officials , including some of those on the National Economic Council and in the Pentagon . They argue that China could retaliate against the United States by penalizing U.S. businesses and by refusing to cooperate on other foreign_policy issues , such_as stopping North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons program . Asked about next week ' s top-level meeting , Winston Lord , assistant secretary_of_state for East Asia , said : &quot; China is an important policy . We have a_couple_of months to go ( before deciding what happens to China ' s trade benefits ) , and the secretary has just been to China. &quot; Lord said the meeting will address the question of &quot; Just where are we ? &quot; on China policy . During the trip to Beijing last weekend , Christopher found himself in the awkward position of confronting the Chinese regime for its recent arrests of dissidents and urging improved ties . In retrospect , some State_Department officials now believe that the two goals may have been incompatible and that the result undermined the credibility of the secretary ' s warnings to Chinese leaders . But others argue that the firm approach Christopher took_in Beijing was correct and that it will produce results from Beijing over the next few months as long as Clinton and the rest of the Administration are unified . &quot; I can see the end game on this , if we can just get our domestic audience under_control , &quot; one senior State_Department official said . &quot; The idea that we ' re in a box on China policy is overstated . The game is not over . The Chinese have a stake too. &quot; The specific issue confronting the Administration is what to do about China ' s most-favored-nation status , under which Chinese goods are imported into this country with the same low duties enjoyed by most other nations . Clinton ' s executive order calls_on the secretary_of_state to recommend this spring whether to renew trade benefits next year , based on Christopher ' s judgment of whether the Chinese regime has made progress in several specified categories of human_rights . These include , for example , China ' s policy toward Tibet , its treatment of political_prisoners and its willingness to stop jamming Voice of America broadcasts . On March 4 , just as Christopher was about to leave for Asia , Chinese officials detained or arrested a number of dissidents , including Wei Jingsheng , the country ' s best-known democracy activist . Only a_few days earlier , Wei had met in Beijing with John Shattuck , the assistant secretary_of_state for human_rights . When Christopher arrived in Beijing to press for human_rights changes , Chinese officials greeted him with an avalanche of angry complaints that the United States was interfering in China ' s internal affairs . They seized_on Shattuck ' s meeting with Wei as the focal_point for their complaints . A senior State_Department official confirmed Friday that Christopher found_out about Shattuck ' s meeting only after it occurred . &quot; It happened very quickly , &quot; the official said . &quot; I don ' t believe it was cleared in_advance by Christopher. &quot; Shattuck told The Times in a telephone_interview that &quot; the embassy set the meeting up &quot; with Wei . &quot; On previous trips , I have routinely met with other people outside the government , &quot; he said . * RELATED STORY : D1</TEXT>
