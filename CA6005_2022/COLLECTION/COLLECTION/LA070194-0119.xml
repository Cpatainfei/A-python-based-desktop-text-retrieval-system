   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; U.S. DISMAYED BY MARADONA ' S LATEST FALL ; REACTION : NATIONAL TEAM MEMBERS PREFER TO REMEMBER SUSPENDED ARGENTINE SUPERSTAR FOR HIS DEEDS ON THE FIELD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The question for Claudio Reyna and hundreds of thousands of fans around the world : Is it time to take_down the posters of Diego Maradona ? Reyna , the U.S. midfielder whose parents are from Argentina , grew_up with posters of Maradona and the_Argentine national team in his room . He admired Maradona the player but said he never had illusions about Maradona the man . Wednesday ' s revelation that the_Argentine team captain had tested positive for ephedrine , a banned substance , did not change Reyna ' s view . &quot; He ' s a player I have always looked_up_to on the field , &quot; Reyna said Thursday . &quot; On the field , not off . You see it in this country -- there are athletes who have problems . I ' ve always idolized him on the field . I don ' t know him , I can ' t judge him . On the field is how I judge him . &quot; I was shocked and disappointed and kind of left wondering why he took the banned substance . Whether it came from his doctor or the federation , we ' ll never know . It ' s a huge mistake on someone ' s part . It was foolish. &quot; Reaction at the U.S. training camp to Maradona ' s expulsion from the tournament was varied , but no one was pleased with the news . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic , who coached briefly in the_Argentine professional league , said he felt sorry_for Maradona ' s family . &quot; I know him well , &quot; Milutinovic said . &quot; He ' s a great example of what it means to be a soccer player . It ' s sad that such a great legend may finish ( his career ) the way he has now . I feel sorry_for him as a human_being . We should take a moment to think_about what ' s going_on and to think_about what ' s important in life . &quot; He ' s a human_being who made a mistake , and I think people need to remember that . He ' s given a lot to the world of soccer . He ' s done so_much for soccer in Argentina and for the people. &quot; Reyna too considered Maradona ' s legacy and how this week ' s events might affect the way in which the superstar would be remembered . &quot; He ' s going_to be remembered for leading Argentina , of course . But not in the same fashion that Pele went_out , &quot; Reyna said . &quot; Twenty years down the road , he ' s not going_to be remembered like Pele . He had a beautiful story until ( a previous ) cocaine bust . It ruined his storybook life. &quot; Rarely has Maradona ' s turbulent life been described as storybook , but his abilities on the field are themselves a textbook for aspiring soccer players . &quot; I don ' t think he ' s a fallen hero , by any means , &quot; Reyna said , speaking_to a group of reporters . &quot; He just made a mistake that a person like him can ' t make . In this country , they are going_to harp on it a lot in the media , like you guys are right now. &quot; Said forward Roy Wegerle : &quot; I guess it dents the sport in some respect . There ' s always someone willing to try something . It ' s a pity it ' s him . He ' s the most popular soccer player in the world . It ' s something the World Cup could have done without. &quot; Some players cringed when asked what Maradona ' s absence would mean to the tournament . &quot; He means so_much to the game , &quot; defender Alexi Lalas said . &quot; This World Cup has been sensational , on and off the field . The World Cup will continue to go_on . It ' ll just be without Maradona. &quot;</TEXT>
