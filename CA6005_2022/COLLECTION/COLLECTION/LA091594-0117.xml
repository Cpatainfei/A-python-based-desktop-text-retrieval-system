   <HEADLINE> BABY-SMUGGLING TRIAL UNDER WAY IN ROMANIA ; EUROPE : BRITISH COUPLE WHO PAID BROKERS $ 6 # 000 SAY THEY DIDN ' T KNOW THEY WERE BREAKING THE LAW . CASE IS LIKELY TO HAVE CHILLING EFFECT ON ILLEGAL ADOPTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A British couple accused of trying to smuggle a Romanian baby out of this country after paying $ 6 # 000 to shady brokers to obtain her insisted on the first day of their trial Wednesday that they didn ' t realize they were violating any law . Bernadette and Adrian Mooney of Wokingham , England , are the first foreigners from among tens of thousands who have sought to adopt Romanian children to be charged with criminal conduct and threatened with jail time . No verdict is expected in the case for at least two weeks as a lawyer for one of five Romanians being tried simultaneously with the Mooneys won an adjournment to call another witness on his client ' s behalf . But the prosecution of the_British couple is expected to have a chilling effect on the rash of illegal and questionable adoptions again plaguing Romania after a 1991 crackdown on the black_market baby trade . Madalina Buta , the senior of two judges who heard seven hours of testimony from the Mooneys and the Romanian defendants , read an indictment accusing the couple of willfully arranging an illegal adoption of 5-month-old Monica Baiaram in July . The indictment claims the Mooneys administered a sedative to the baby to quiet her for the car trip across a remote border crossing , hid the child under a blanket in a cardboard box , and then , when border authorities discovered her behind the car ' s front seat , attempted to pass_off the infant as a previously adopted 3-year-old listed on Mrs . Mooney ' s passport . The Mooneys ' claims of being unaware of official regulations appeared to be undermined by their having legally adopted another Romanian child in 1991 . Over the past three years , the number of abandoned children has dropped substantially in Romania , because birth_control is now legal and available . Romanian adoption procedures also have been substantially restricted in an attempt to discourage illicit baby-trading , regulations that make the Mooneys ineligible for legal adoptions . Romania has nevertheless retained an unseemly reputation as a country where children are easily available . The overthrow of hard-line communism in Romania in December , 1989 , revealed that at least 100 # 000 children had been abandoned to filthy and ill-supplied institutions by parents who had been forced to bear them by the tyrannical population policies of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu . He wanted Romania to expand to 30 million inhabitants . Altruistic rescues of sick and disabled infants from the appalling institutions quickly deteriorated into a flood of foreigners seeking Caucasian infants for uncomplicated adoptions . More_than 10 # 000 children were handed_over to foreign parents in 1990 alone . Embarrassed by the worldwide image that Romanian children were for_sale , the government imposed a moratorium on adoptions in 1991 and ordered a rewriting of legal procedures . But amendments to the adoption laws have allowed courts at the local level to handle the cases , which has resulted in another rash of adoptions and allegedly inspired new networks of unauthorized middlemen who are paid to match cash-carrying foreigners with desperate parents and corrupt court officials . While only 391 foreign adoptions were approved by local courts in all_of 1993 , the number through June of this year exceeds 850 . Western diplomats speculate that baby-smuggling and illegal payments to local authorities are also on the rise , although no reliable estimates are available . Testimony in the Mooney case indicated that border authorities had been tipped_off to the couple ' s activity , likely by a rival gang of baby brokers . Buta , the judge , said police had the couple under surveillance on July 5 -- the day they admit paying $ 6 # 000 to Ioan Batrana . Batrana , who admitted to having arranged four previous adoptions , is charged with preparing fake adoption forms and bribing two other defendants to locate a baby whose natural parents would be amenable to selling the child . Monica Baiaram , now 7 months old , has been transferred to a Bucharest orphanage pending completion of the trial . Romanian legal_experts speculated prior to Wednesday ' s start of testimony that the Mooneys are likely to draw a suspended sentence and expulsion , while the three Romanian middlemen are expected to be jailed . The underage natural parents , both 17 , are charged with endangering the child and stand to lose parental rights . &quot; The one good thing to come_out of this tragedy is that of focusing_on concern for children ' s welfare in Romania . Obviously , there ' s nothing wrong with adoption as long as it is done legally and with regulation , &quot; said Don McCready of the Romanian Orphanage Trust that assists with legal adoptions . &quot; For too long people have come here thinking that they can take babies out of the country easily. &quot; Although state homes still house tens of thousands of children abandoned during Ceausescu ' s tyrannical rule , most are above the age desired by prospective adoptive parents and many suffer disabilities stemming from botched abortion attempts and poor early_childhood care .</TEXT>
