   <HEADLINE> SAILING ; 47TH NEWPORT-ENSENADA RACE TO BEGIN TODAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three defending class champions , but not Newsboy , are among 410 entries scheduled to start the 47th Newport-Ensenada International Yacht_Race off Newport Beach at noon today . Newsboy , Jack Baillie ' s wooden 12-meter built for the America ' s Cup in the ' 50s , has competed in 37 Ensenada races and won more trophies than any other boat.This year , however , Baillie did not enter . Class corrected-time winners from last year returning include Carl Eichenlaub ' s Cadenza in PHRF , John R . Simpkins ' Flying_Fish in Ocean Racing Catamaran Assn . and Dave Dillehay ' s 50-foot Aldora in IMS . Dennis Conner ' s 60-foot catamaran Stars &amp; Stripes also is entered . It was first to finish last year and holds the elapsed-time record of 9 hours 7 minutes . The weather_forecast for the start called_for northwest_winds of 20 to 30 knots , meaning the boats could be flying off the line under spinnakers -- a rare sight . RICH ROBERTS</TEXT>
