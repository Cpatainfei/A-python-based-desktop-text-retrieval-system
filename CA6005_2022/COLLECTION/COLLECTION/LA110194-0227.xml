   <HEADLINE> CLINIC OFFICIAL ' S MURDER TRIAL BEGINS ; COURTS : PROSECUTOR SAYS ADMINISTRATOR TRIED TO COVER_UP PATIENT ' S DEATH . VICTIM DIED BEFORE ABORTION WAS PERFORMED AND AUTOPSY WAS BOTCHED , DEFENSE COUNTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An abortion clinic administrator on_trial for murder had a &quot; monetary motive &quot; when she began performing the risky procedures without medical training and then tried to cover_up the January , 1993 , death of a young patient , a prosecutor said Monday . A defense_attorney for Alicia Hanna , 32 , agreed with some of the prosecution ' s allegations but denied that Hanna was guilty of murder , saying the victim died before an abortion was performed and a botched autopsy has concealed the true cause of the woman ' s death . Angela Nieto Sanchez , 27 , of Orange died Jan . 19 , 1993 , after going_to Hanna ' s Bristol Street clinic for an abortion . Sanchez began vomiting and foaming at the mouth , after Hanna injected her with an unknown drug , yet Hanna refused to let an assistant call 911 , prosecutor Rick King told an Orange County Superior_Court jury during opening statements . &quot; The defendant said , ' No , I ' ll save her -- we ' ll get_in trouble , ' &quot; and hung_up the phone , said King , who depicted Hanna as a financially ailing businesswoman looking_to make fast money . &quot; The defendant made a conscious choice to cut_out the middle man -- the doctors -- and the defendant decided to perform abortions on_her_own , &quot; King said . Hanna is charged with murder in Sanchez ' s death and with performing or attempting to perform abortions on two other women in the fall of 1992 , even though she is not licensed to do so , King said . In one of those cases , the procedure did not work -- a fact the woman did not learn until several weeks later , King said . Deputy Public_Defender Steve Biskar told jurors his client was only performing illegal abortions to help desperate , impoverished women who believed they had nowhere else to turn . The defense_attorney also told jurors a &quot; negligent &quot; coroner did not preserve sufficient autopsy specimens for further testing and said the autopsy fails to prove how Hanna died . &quot; There is no scientific , defined explanation &quot; for Sanchez ' s death , said Biskar , who said his client frantically tried to perform CPR and use other measures to save the patient . Two of Sanchez ' s three children were waiting for their mother outside the clinic when she died , King said . Hanna had an assistant tell the boy and girl that their mother had already gone_home , and sent the children home with an uncle who came_to pick them up , he said . In the meantime , Hanna was asking friends to help her dump Sanchez ' s body and her car in Tijuana , King said . When Sanchez ' s relatives returned to the clinic to find her , they discovered Hanna attempting to hoist the dead woman ' s body into the trunk of Sanchez ' s car , he said . Biskar told jurors his client tried to cover_up her actions because she was afraid law_enforcement officials would discover she was performing illegal abortions at her clinic . &quot; She panicked and she tried to cover it up , &quot; Biskar said .</TEXT>
