   <TEXT> We ' ve all seen the beautiful pictures of Japanese homes with their minimalist rooms of uncluttered elegance : tatami mats , shoji screens , perhaps a patinated tonsu chest , and the tokonoma ( alcove of honor ) with its hanging scroll , burning incense , a flower . Not a thing is out_of_place . But have you ever wondered how ordinary folk live ? The cocktail attendants and department_store employees , painters and construction workers , artists and designers ? Thirty-eight-year-old photographer and architectural writer Kyoichi Tsuzuki shot more_than 100 Tokyo apartments of working men and women to create his tongue-in-cheek peek into their lives . The book , &quot; Tokyo Style , &quot; recently distributed in the United States through RAM Publications U.S.A. , offers images that are the antithesis of the restrained traditional Japanese interior we ' ve come_to expect , and are a lot more lively . Says Tsuzuki , &quot; In the traditional Japanese house , everything was put_away . In these Tokyo apartments , everything is out . You see people ' s lives displayed. &quot; While many Japanese dream of having more space , most cannot afford to . A 1400-square-foot house in the Tokyo area costs $ 1.3 million , while the average salaried worker makes $ 37 # 000 a year . Instead , the Japanese have refined the art of living in small places . Tsuzuki dubs it &quot; cockpit living &quot; and extols its benefits . &quot; You have everything at your fingertips -- your food , CD , TV , computer -- without leaving your bed. &quot; Younger people especially , who have seen their parents slave to pay_for more living space , would rather spend money on things they enjoy than on high rent , Tsuzuki says . And if your apartment , which averages 680 square_feet in Tokyo , doesn ' t have such amenities as a toilet , kitchen or bath , a little improvising can take_care of that . Neighborhood public baths , restaurants and coffeehouses furnish food and bathing , right outside your door . &quot; It ' s the opposite of L.A. , where you have to drive everywhere , &quot; Tsuzuki says . And while the places may_not always look neat , &quot; they reflect an energy of living , &quot; Tsuzuki adds . Perhaps this is what turn-of-the-century Japanese philosopher Ikki Kita meant when he proclaimed his vision of_the_essence of Japanese aesthetics : &quot; Beauty is to be found in disarray. &quot; Barbara Thornburg</TEXT>
