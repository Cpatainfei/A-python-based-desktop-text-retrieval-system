   <HEADLINE> GAO ASSAILS STOCKBROKER PUNISHMENT ; SECURITIES : A REPORT CHIDES SEC AND THE EXCHANGES FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH TO GET ' ROGUES ' OUT OF THE BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Securities and Exchange Commission and the nation ' s stock_exchanges are not wielding a stick big enough to drive dishonest stockbrokers out of the financial industry , according to an advance copy of a General Accounting Office report obtained Thursday by The Times . The GAO report , commissioned by the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance , faults the SEC , the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , the New York Stock_Exchange and other exchanges for failing to permanently bar &quot; unscrupulous &quot; brokers . Regulators , it says , impose seemingly mild punishments that &quot; may give investors the perception that violators are tolerated. &quot; The subcommittee , under chairman Rep . Edward J . Markey ( D-Mass. ) , is_due to hold hearings beginning Wednesday on the problem of &quot; rogue brokers &quot; at major Wall_Street firms who prey on small investors through dishonest sales practices . In a 1992 series , The Times reported that many of the nation ' s biggest , best-known brokerages knowingly hired and retained brokers with long records of disciplinary actions , lawsuits and customer complaints . Subsequently , the SEC conducted a major inquiry into the problem , resulting in a May report that found evidence of serious rule violations at 25 % of the brokerage branch offices inspected . The GAO study , scheduled for formal release at the hearing , found that formal disciplinary action against brokers was rare and that the NASD and stock_exchanges often took informal action that was never reported to the public or government regulators . GAO investigators also found that although the SEC &quot; permanently &quot; bans from the securities industry dishonest brokers and supervisors who have committed serious violations , many eventually are allowed to return . Others are able to migrate to different parts of the financial industry , including insurance sales and banking . As part of its study , the GAO surveyed state securities regulators and found that many were dissatisfied with the punishments imposed on brokers by the SEC , NASD and the exchanges . Of 44 state regulators , 24 faulted the NASD for lax enforcement and 14 complained that the agency was too lenient . ( The NASD operates the Nasdaq over-the-counter stock_market and supervises many smaller brokerage firms. ) In one case , the report says , a broker barred by the SEC because of fraudulent sales of securities was allowed to remain in the business -- provided that he sold only mutual_funds and annuities . In another instance , the president of a securities firm was fined and disciplined twice by the NASD for serious rules violations . But the NASD then allowed him to work_at another firm as a broker , supervised by a former employee . Brandon Becker , head of the SEC division of market regulation , said the agency would not talk_about the GAO findings until SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . testifies next week at Markey ' s hearing . But in a written comment attached_to the GAO report , Becker defended the SEC ' s record and said the commission had acted responsibly in allowing certain banned brokers to return to work . NASD officials could not be reached for comment late Thursday . The SEC already has taken a number of steps to crack_down on firms that employ dishonest brokers , including launching formal enforcement actions and calling_on the exchanges to step_up their inspections and supervision of brokerage firms.GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE</TEXT>
