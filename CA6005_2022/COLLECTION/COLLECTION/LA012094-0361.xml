   <HEADLINE> REALIGNMENT , NEW PLAYOFFS BECOME OFFICIAL IN BASEBALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Realignment of the American and National leagues into three divisions each and adoption of an extra playoff round for 1994 became a reality Wednesday when owners accepted a union proposal on player compensation during the new five-game playoff . Call it a goodwill gesture by the owners in preparation for the difficult attempt to get the players to agree to a salary cap in the impending collective_bargaining negotiations . &quot; This was not the occasion for hard bargaining over a relatively small amount_of_money , &quot; Richard Ravitch , the owners ' chief negotiator , said of the decision to accept the union proposal . &quot; It ' s a time to be collegial and show we can reach agreement without a lot of acrimony. &quot; Said Don Fehr , executive_director of the union : &quot; Dick can characterize it any way he wants . I ' m just happy to have it resolved. &quot; The players will receive 80 % of the gate from the first three games of the new playoff round , about $ 9.6 million based on a $ 20 ticket , Ravitch said . They will continue to receive 60 % of the gate from the first four games of the league championship series and World_Series . Since their new TV agreement calls_for the owners to be paid on a per-game basis during the postseason , rather than receiving a lump sum , the players had hoped to be paid on the same basis but offered the higher percentage -- 80 compared to 60 -- as an alternative , Fehr said . The union also hoped to have the whole postseason pool renegotiated , but the owners elected to negotiate only the new round , he said . The agreement is for one year and will be renegotiated if the owners stay with the new alignment in 1995 . ROSS NEWHAN</TEXT>
