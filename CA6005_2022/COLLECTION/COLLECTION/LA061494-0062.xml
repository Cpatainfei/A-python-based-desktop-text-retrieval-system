   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : BERLIN ; FAREWELL TO ALLIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 2 # 000 American , British and French soldiers will march down Berlin ' s monument-studded Strasse Des Siebzehnten Juni this Saturday as the city of Berlin bids its final , official farewell to the Western Allies who have occupied it since 1945 . The last American soldiers are scheduled to leave Germany on Sept . 8 . Although it was the Soviet Red Army that virtually single-handedly overwhelmed Berlin and broke the Nazi power base there 49 years ago , no Russian troops will participate in Saturday ' s parade through the city . German authorities instead have scheduled a separate Russian farewell parade in the Berlin suburb of Koepenick . Though Russians say they would prefer to march down Berlin ' s most historic boulevard with their World_War_II Allies , authorities say it was routine to hold separate Eastern and Western ceremonies during the time the Berlin Wall marked the division of East and West Germany .</TEXT>
