   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / DENNIS PRAGER : OUR FATHER FIGURE WHO ART IN HEAVEN ; FEMINISTS WHO ARGUE FOR A GENDER-NEUTRAL BIBLE SHOULD STOP TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent Presbyterian conference on &quot; re-imagining God &quot; as a female deity has made apparent once again that many Christians and Jews are having a difficult time with the traditional masculine depictions of God . The reason for this difficulty is the widespread belief that the only reason the Bible refers to God in the masculine is the patriarchy and sexism of the ancient world . It ' s true that the Bible is written within a patriarchal context and that there is sexism in Bible-based religions . But these facts alone do not explain why God is depicted as a &quot; father &quot; rather than as a &quot; parent &quot; or &quot; mother. &quot; The depiction of God in masculine terms is , in fact , essential to the fundamental moral purposes of the Bible and Judeo-Christian society . If you consider that the Bible ' s primary concern is moral behavior and that most perpetrators of violence against innocent people are males , several reasons for depicting God as a father suggest themselves . * Boys take rules from men . When they are young , males need to feel accountable to a male authority figure . Without a father or some_other male rule-giver , young_men are likely to do great harm . Many mothers will tell you that if there is no male authority figure to give a boy rules , it is virtually impossible for her to control his wilder impulses . For this reason , a God depicted in masculine terms -- not a goddess , not a &quot; Mother in heaven &quot; -- must be the source of &quot; Thou shall not murder , &quot; &quot; Thou shall not steal , &quot; etc . Women who feel discriminated against because of the male depiction of God need to ask themselves whether any discomfort they may feel because of a masculine depiction of God is comparable_to the pain they will suffer if boys are not civilized into good men . Those who do not acknowledge the need for male moral authority only have to study the criminal population in the United States in the late 20th Century . They will find that , more_than any other factor , the absence of a father or other male authority figure in the formative years of boy ' s life contributes to criminal behavior . If the father-figure / rule-giver that boys need is not on Earth , a loving and morally authoritative father in heaven can often serve as an effective substitute . * Males need a male role_model . In order to transform a wild boy into a good man , a male role_model is as necessary as a male rule-giver . When the Bible depicts God as merciful , caring for the helpless and a lover of justice , it is not so_much interested in describing God who is , after all , largely indescribable but in providing a model for human emulation . If God were a female , boys and men would deem these beautiful traits as &quot; feminine , &quot; and therefore , in their pursuit of their masculinity , reject them . But if God -- our father in heaven who is_on occasion a warrior -- cares_for the poor and loves justice , mercy and kindness , then these traits are masculine , and to be emulated . The argument that this is sexist , since girls need moral female models , is irrelevant and untrue . The problem of violence is a male one -- and one the Bible is most concerned with -- and girls are able to retain their femininity and their decency with a male-depicted God . Of course , girls need female role_models -- but not in_order to avoid violence . * The male is more rule-oriented . Law and order are not code words for repression , but rather the essential building_blocks of a decent society . It is , therefore , natural and desirable that God will be identified with the gender that is more naturally disposed to rules and justice -- males . Females are more naturally inclined toward feelings and compassion -- essential qualities for a decent personal life , but not for the governance of society . A final , personal note : I am a strong supporter of women ' s equality ; my own religious life is egalitarian ; I fully acknowledge that God is neither male nor female , and I regard the notion that either sex is superior as nonsense . Yet , I find it ironic that some women in the name of feminism , are attempting to emasculate the God of Western religious morality . If their goal is achieved , it is women who will suffer most from lawless males . We have too many absent fathers on Earth to begin to even entertain the thought of having no father in heaven .</TEXT>
