   <HEADLINE> JUST PLAIN FOLK ; DANCING SKILLS AND A SENSE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOP IN A CIRCLE ( OR SQUARE OR LINE ) OF FRIENDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bill Evans ' eyes glazed_over every week for months . The folk_dance lessons weren ' t so easy after all . But now he has joined scores of other folk_dancers across Orange County who have developed a zeal that often borders_on fanaticism . &quot; I live five minutes away , &quot; Evans said recently at the Fullerton park where he dances , &quot; and I chose that apartment because it was close to here. &quot; Like fancy underwear , there ' s a different folk_dance class in the county for each night of the week . But whether it ' s Scottish or Cajun , square or Scandinavian dance they prefer , local practitioners share an all-too-rare sense of community , a passion for good , sober fun and highly developed calf muscles . &quot; It ' s great exercise , &quot; said Chino psychotherapist Anne Swanson Brown , beads of sweat dotting her forehead during a recent Israeli dance_lesson in Costa Mesa . Brown ' s classmate David Friedman , a Mission Viejo attorney , said : &quot; I come for the physical ( benefits ) but also for the mental . For three or four hours , I forget all my problems , and I ' m in another world where it ' s only music and good times. &quot; Times haven ' t always been good for many forms of folk_dance , which lack the popularity they had during their counterculture heyday of 20 or 30 years ago , said Robert Altman , president of Orange County Folkdancers . As the idea of &quot; making your own fun &quot; became increasingly foreign to Americans , Altman said , folk_dance clubs moved off college campuses into the private sector . And that , Altman said , meant vastly fewer young people being recruited and an increase in dancers ' average age . The proliferation of aerobics , martial_arts , VCRs and competition from such popular_music and dance forms as country didn ' t help either , according to folk aficionados . So beginning this Friday , to drum_up renewed interest , the Laguna Folkdancers group will offer its first introduction to international folk_dance class at its 24th annual festival , a three-day_event . One of the area ' s major folk celebrations , the festival typically attracts about 400 enthusiasts from throughout Southern California , who come for workshops with local and noted visiting teachers , performances by local troupes and dance parties . Meanwhile , several county groups are holding steady or going stronger than ever : INTERNATIONAL FOLK_DANCE Orange County Folkdancers , Laguna Folkdancers and Veselo Selo Folkdancers all practice international folk_dance , which , despite the name , focuses_on traditional cultures of Balkan and central European_countries , parts of Russia and areas around the eastern Mediterranean_Sea . Dances may be easy , involving little more_than walking and low kicks and hops , or intricate , brain-taxing endurance tests . There are solos , couple dances and group line dances , similar to country line dances except that participants hold each others ' hands or grasp shoulders or belts . Roughly 20 Laguna Folkdancers performed a Macedonian Lesnoto , clasping hands for the simple , lyrical line dance at a recent Sunday gathering . Wearing the soft , pointy-toed opanke sandal common among folk_dancers , many hummed along to a soulful tune . One participant candidly assessed the evening ' s crowd , made_up of 30- and 40-year-olds , as a bunch of fogies doing walking-around dances. &quot; But , &quot; a lot of young people are involved , &quot; countered Michelle Sandler , 37 , a 16-year folk_dance veteran . &quot; And if anyone wants to do more vigorous dances , they can request them. &quot; Added Steve Himel , a Newport Beach computer_programmer , &quot; I like the variety that international folk_dance offers. &quot; SQUARE_DANCE Considered one of America ' s own folk_dances , square_dancing is thriving here , due_to such active organizations as Shirts ' N Skirts , turning 35 this year . Its members hugging and chatting before a recent class , the group ' s palpable sense of community is emblematic of the local folk_dance scene , where dancers take trips and celebrate birthdays , anniversaries and holidays en masse , and old-timers take pains to make newcomers feel welcome . &quot; You ' re working as a team with seven or eight people , so you depend_on each other , &quot; said Dave Rensberger , a Shirts ' N Skirts dance caller . &quot; And it ' s the whole spectrum of society ; nobody cares what you do outside of square dancing. &quot; Shirts ' N Skirts dances , held at Santa Ana ' s Ebell clubhouse , are a step back in time : The spitting image of the decals seen on many_an RV , these beaming petticoated ladies and bolo-tied gents do-si-do and promenade to Rensberger ' s singsong calls : &quot; Circle to the right left with a yak yak yak , dance up_to the middle with a whoop and a holler. &quot; Still , today ' s square_dancing has evolved from its English and French roots into a more complex art with hundreds of movements and patterns . Lessons are mandatory . Shirts ' N Skirts ' next 10-month session for beginners will start in January . While dancers range from age 13 to eightysomething , the average Shirks ' N Skirts member is 40 , and women tend to outnumber men . Cornering a visiting reporter , Cathy McLeod of Newport Beach worked to amend that . &quot; Tell all_the guys in town , &quot; said McLeod , a vision in pink , &quot; if they want to meet some really nice gals , and pretty ones too , they should come_to the Ebell club . And tell them to bring a guy with them. &quot; &quot; The best thing about square_dancing is that there ' s no drinking , &quot; offered Peg Bogard , a Huntington Beach businesswoman . &quot; It ' s not a written rule , but if you ' re drinking , you ' re not thinking , which would screw_up three other couples. &quot; SCOTTISH Wanna-be folk_dancers may be lured to this brand just by the names of its jigs : Sandy O ' er the Lea , Misses Cramb of Linlithgow , Jessie ' s Hornpipe , Dashing White Sergeant , Sugar Candie , De ' il Amang the Tailors . The curious should have a taste for refinement too . Scottish dance , with its origin in the royal French court , demands precise lower-leg articulation , proper deportment and &quot; has all_the etiquette of polite society of a day gone_by , &quot; said instructor Bob Patterson . &quot; You escort your partner_off the floor , &quot; said Patterson , who teaches at the Edison Community_Center in Huntington Beach . &quot; You don ' t slump. &quot; Even , however , while striving to keep toes pointed and heels elevated , students at a recent class seemed to be having no less fun than that De ' il Amang the Tailors . &quot; The music is upbeat , and people have a good time , &quot; said Linda Boucher , a retired art_teacher . &quot; It ' s a real mental challenge because there are so many different combinations of steps , but you end_up feeling like you ' ve really accomplished something. &quot; ROUND_DANCING The lack of a major mental challenge is the allure of Round_Dancing , named after dancers ' circular progression around the room . The &quot; lazy-man ' s ballroom , &quot; its followers perform simplified versions of the waltz , tango , swing , fox trot , samba and other social dances , said Harmon Jorritsma , who teaches with his wife , Betty , in Orange and Anaheim . &quot; We dance for enjoyment and fun , &quot; Jorritsma said , &quot; and we have our own rules , but they aren ' t very strict. &quot; Additionally , a caller cues each new move so that men don ' t have to choreograph on their feet , a ballroom must . &quot; It ' s so great to be able to dance and not have to make anything up , &quot; said round dancer John Guerin , 63 , as couples swirled slowly by during Jorritsma ' s recent Anaheim session . Most of the swirlers were were in their 70s and 80s ; some have been at it for more_than a quarter-century . &quot; We ' re celebrating a 60th wedding_anniversary tonight , &quot; said Betty Jorritsma , whose class numbered about 100 recently . &quot; I send birthday_cards to everyone too. &quot; ISRAELI Slapping the ground , skipping , whistling , whooping and raising their hands skyward to God , Israeli dancers at a recent Costa Mesa class hardly paused for breath between songs . &quot; Yassou ! &quot; one called_out . &quot; Opa ! &quot; called another . Some of the dances Yoni Carr teaches every Wednesday night are old classics . There ' s erev ba , a circle dance like the hora , and bat yiftch , a couples dance . Some , on the other hand , are brand-new . &quot; We get the latest dances from Israel by fax , &quot; said Uri Hazan . &quot; I ' m not kidding ! &quot; Swanson Brown , 36 , drives 40 minutes each way to attend Carr ' s group . She prefers it over those that have more of a &quot; night club &quot; atmosphere , which has &quot; broken_up a lot of marriages , &quot; she said . &quot; They turn_down the lights and have a lot more couple dances. &quot; &quot; We get people from San Diego , Pomona , wherever , &quot; Friedman said . &quot; Sometimes we have up_to 100. &quot; SCANDINAVIAN Warning : Couple-dance phobics , don ' t apply . Scandinavian dancers don ' t whirl arm-in-arm around the floor . They whirl bear-hug around the floor . &quot; It ' s not because Scandinavians are friendlier , more affectionate people , &quot; explained Donna Tripp , who teaches dances of Norway , Sweden , Denmark and Finland with Ted Martin in Anaheim for the 30-year-old Skandia Dance Club . But the Swedish polska hold is used , Tripp said , because couples execute different steps , while , like the Earth around the sun , they ' re rotating as one unit and circling the room . If not exactly a bear_hug , it ' s a much more intimate coupling position than typically seen . &quot; It gives a very firm position in_regard_to the partner and allows_for closer contact and better centering of the dance , &quot; she said . Tripps ' students learn mostly traditional Scandinavian forms of waltz , schottische , polka and other couple dances that involve walking and turning , with lots of variations on that theme . Amy Dale likes the challenge . &quot; It looks deceptively simple , &quot; she said , &quot; but it ' s not. &quot; Like just about every folk group around the county , this one functions , even if not by design , as a singles group , with plenty of happy endings . &quot; We ' ve had probably 10 or 12 marriages grow out of this &quot; group , said Tripp , who has spent most of her life in dance , whether ballet or folk , and likes to quote that like-minded comic_strip canine . &quot; As Snoopy says , ' To live is to dance , and to dance is to live.
