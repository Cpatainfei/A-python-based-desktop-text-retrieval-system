   <HEADLINE> TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING ? ; THIS YEAR ' S ROCK HALL OF FAME BALLOT BOASTS A STRONG LINEUP , FROM ALLMANS TO ZEP , BUT IT MAY MEAN SOME WORTHY ARTISTS GET PASSED_OVER AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s a logjam at the entrance to the Rock_and_Roll Hall_of_Fame . For the first time in the foundation ' s 10-year history , there are more deserving artists -- including Led Zeppelin , Janis Joplin and Neil Young -- on the Hall_of_Fame ballot than can be inducted under the rules . On one hand , that ' s good news . The hall ' s voting process has often been criticized for turning_to secondary artists -- such_as the Four Seasons and the Platters -- to fill the annual quota of seven . Why ? The more stars at the induction banquet the better . But the flood of candidates this time presents its own hazard . If the 600 voting record executives , musicians and critics skipped_over such landmark acts_as Joni Mitchell and the Velvet Underground last year when the competition was less intense , they could very well look past these essential artists again . Of the 15 names on this year ' s ballots , 10 made the kind of invaluable contributions to the evolution of rock that merit Hall_of_Fame recognition . But the difference between those 10 acts -- in terms of artistic excellence , chiefly , but also influence and longevity -- is sometimes substantial . Under hall rules , artists become eligible 25 years after the release of their first record , so artists who began their careers in 1969 are now eligible . The seven winners are expected to be announced shortly with induction ceremonies scheduled for Jan . 12 in New York . Here is a personal ranking of the nominees . 1 . Neil Young -- Three Top 40 singles as a solo artist , including 1972 ' s &quot; Heart of Gold , &quot; plus 19 Top 40 solo albums stretching from 1969 ' s &quot; Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere &quot; to the current &quot; Sleeps With Angels. &quot; First year of eligibility as a solo artist . * Young is a restless , independent spirit who fearlessly follows his most radical instincts , whether it leads him to moments of delicate introspection or unrelenting sonic assault . He has been cited by today ' s young alternative rockers -- from Sonic Youth to Pearl Jam -- as more of an influence than Bob Dylan . Young ' s recent &quot; Sleeps With Angels &quot; is an album of the year contender . Who else in rock has shown that kind of creative vitality after 25 years ? * 2 . Joni Mitchell -- Four Top 40 singles , including &quot; Help Me &quot; and &quot; Big Yellow Taxi &quot; in 1974 , plus 12 Top 40 albums , including 1971 ' s &quot; Blue &quot; and 1974 ' s &quot; Court and Spark. &quot; Second year of eligibility . * The failure of the Hall_of_Fame judges to induct Mitchell during her first year of eligibility in 1993 was as big an embarrassment as overlooking Bob Marley a_few years back . Hailed as an influence by artists as diverse as Prince and alternative rock hero Paul Westerberg , Mitchell -- whose new &quot; Turbulent Indigo &quot; album is one of the year ' s strongest works -- is a unique voice of the modern pop era . She is a master of musical textures who rivals Dylan for literary sensibility and the ability to examine relationships with an uncompromising eye . * 3 . Led Zeppelin -- Six Top 40 singles , including 1969 ' s &quot; Whole Lotta Love &quot; and 1971 ' s &quot; Black Dog , &quot; plus 11 Top 40 albums , including eight Top 5 sellers in a row between 1969 ' s &quot; Led Zeppelin II &quot; and 1979 ' s &quot; In Through the Out Door. &quot; First year of eligibility . * This British band was beaten_up by critics because its songs lacked the revelation or craft , lyrically , that you expect of a world-class group . But there ' s no denying the quartet ' s influence on everyone from Jane ' s Addiction to Soundgarden . Zeppelin ' s legacy is its focus_on the sheer exhilaration of music ; its aggression and assault are all_the more striking because of occasional moments of tenderness and beauty . * 4 . Janis Joplin -- Just one Top 40 single -- 1971 ' s &quot; Me and Bobby McGee &quot; -- and four Top 40 albums as a solo artist , but she had another Top 40 single -- 1968 ' s &quot; Piece of My Heart &quot; -- and a Top 40 album as a member of Big Brother &amp; the Holding_Company . First year of eligibility as a solo artist . * Joplin , who died of a heroin overdose in 1970 at the age of 27 , may have been the most undisciplined artist ever to achieve superstar status in rock . Despite neither the vocal purity of Chrissie Hynde nor the revolutionary songwriting vision of Patti Smith , Joplin still stands as rock ' s most captivating female performer . The blues-rocker ' s weapon was pure passion . She sang with such intensity and abandon that you felt as if she was giving you a piece of her heart every time she stepped_on stage . * 5 . Velvet Underground -- No Top 40 singles or Top 100 albums until &quot; VU , &quot; a collection of previously unreleased material , broke_into the album charts in 1985 , more_than a dozen years after the band called it quits . Fourth year of eligibility . * You might be able to forgive the Hall_of_Fame voters for passing_over this group once , but it ' s a disgrace when it happens three times . One reason may be that the Velvets never had a Top 40 hit . Another is the voters may be waiting to honor Lou Reed , the group ' s key member , when he becomes eligible as a solo artist in 1997 . that ' s faulty thinking . Hall_of_Fame membership should be based on creative contribution , not sales -- and the influence of the Velvets ' studies in social realism on ' 80s and ' 90s bands stands independent of Reed ' s later works . * 6 . Al Green -- Fourteen Top 40 singles , from 1971 ' s &quot; Tired of Being Alone &quot; through 1988 ' s duet with Annie Lennox on &quot; Put a Little Love in Your Heart , &quot; and eight Top 40 albums , notably 1972 ' s &quot; Let ' s Stay_Together &quot; and &quot; I ' m Still in_Love With You. &quot; First year of eligibility . * Here ' s a superb singer and performer who rates with Hall_of_Fame members Ray Charles , Sam Cooke , Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding as one of the all-time great soul artists . His streak of ' 70s hits with producer Willie Mitchell at Hi Records in Memphis had some of the most consistently soulful music ever recorded . * 7 . Parliament-Funkadelic -- Parliament and Funkadelic , collectively , have registered three Top 40 singles -- including Parliament ' s 1976 &quot; Tear the Roof Off the Sucker &quot; and Funkadelic ' s 1978 &quot; One Nation Under a Groove &quot; -- and eight Top 40 albums . * Like the Velvet Underground , the importance of George Clinton ' s funk empire may rest as much in its influence as in its actual recordings . Not only did the free-form excursions into R &amp; B , blues and jazz inspire everyone from Prince to the Red Hot Chili_Peppers , but they provided an invaluable foundation for much of the music and bravado in today ' s most commanding rap . * 8 . The Allman Brothers Band -- Only three Top 40 singles , including 1973 ' s &quot; Ramblin ' Man , &quot; but eight Top 40 albums , including 1972 ' s &quot; Eat a Peach &quot; and 1973 ' s &quot; Brothers and Sisters. &quot; First year of eligibility . * When most rock_bands break_into a five-minute instrumental passage , it ' s time to head to the rest room . When the Allman Brothers did_it during the group ' s peak years , you were talking magic . Building its Southern blues-rock sound around the twin guitars of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts and the twin percussion of Butch Trucks and Jai Johnny Johnson , the Allmans were matched only by the Band for pure musical celebration . Of all_the &quot; what ifs &quot; in rock , one of the most interesting is what they might have done if Duane Allman hadn ' t been killed in a 1971 motorcycle accident . * 9 . Frank Zappa -- Only one Top 40 single ( 1982 ' s &quot; Valley Girl , &quot; featuring daughter Moon Unit Zappa ) , but nine Top 40 albums , including 1968 ' s &quot; We ' re Only in It for the Money &quot; and 1975 ' s &quot; One Size Fits All. &quot; Second year of eligibility as a solo artist . * Zappa , who died last year , was a wonderfully subversive influence in pop -- someone whose refusal to accept the conventional limited his sales potential , but kept his music inventive and fresh . His work with the Mothers of Invention was as revolutionary as Dylan ' s words or Hendrix ' s guitar . * 10 . The Jackson 5 -- Eleven Top 10 singles , starting with &quot; I Want You Back &quot; in 1969 , plus 14 Top 40 albums , stretching from &quot; Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5 &quot; in 1970 to &quot; Victory &quot; in 1984 . Second year of eligibility . * It was a surprise to see the Jackson 5 passed_over last year , but the voters must be looking_to 1996 when Michael Jackson becomes eligible as a solo artist . With his brothers in the early ' 70s , however , Michael sang with such youthful yearning and self-affirmation that those records remain wonderfully disarming . * 11 . Buffalo Springfield -- One Top 40 single , 1967 ' s &quot; For What It ' s Worth , &quot; plus three Top 50 albums , including &quot; Buffalo Springfield &quot; and &quot; Buffalo Springfield Again &quot; ( both 1967 ) . Fourth year of eligibility . * The group , which included Neil Young and Stephen Stills , qualifies for the Hall_of_Fame on the basis of creativity and influence , but longevity is a problem . Though the group signaled a generational change almost as vividly as such other Los Angeles bands as the Byrds and the Doors , it broke_up after just two years . * 12 . Jefferson Airplane -- Two Top 40 singles ( 1967 ' s &quot; Somebody to Love &quot; and &quot; White Rabbit &quot; ) as the Airplane , plus 15 Top 40 singles in various Starship formations . Nine Top 40 Airplane albums . Fourth year of eligibility . * There was a time in the ' 60s when the Airplane ' s psychedelic flight seemed as much at the center of the rock experience as Cream or the Doors , both of whom have been voted into the Hall_of_Fame . But the music ' s staying power was surprisingly short and none of the Starship efforts matter . * 13 . Little Willie John -- Four Top 40 pop singles , notably 1956 ' s &quot; Fever , &quot; and 14 Top 20 R &amp; B hits . Tenth year of eligibility . * A distinctive stylist whose career was sabotaged by personal problems , including a manslaughter conviction . He died in prison in 1968 at the age of 30 . * 14 . The Shirelles -- Twelve Top 40 singles , including 1960 ' s &quot; Will You Love Me Tomorrow ? &quot; and &quot; Dedicated to the One I Love , &quot; and one Top 40 album , a 1963 greatest hits package . Tenth year of eligibility . * Another case of a group that made a valuable contribution to a rock ' n ' roll genre -- and outfits have made_it into the Hall_of_Fame for less ( the Four Seasons ) . But the Hall_of_Fame is still a stretch . * 15 . Martha &amp; the Vandellas -- Twelve Top 40 singles , including 1963 ' s ' Quicksand &quot; and 1964 ' s &quot; Dancing in the Street , &quot; but no Top 20 albums . Seventh year of eligibility . * Some great records , but they operated in the shadow of all_the other great Motown acts , where they still remain. *</TEXT>
