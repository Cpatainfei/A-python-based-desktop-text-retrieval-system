   <HEADLINE> BITTER PAGE OF HISTORY ; KOREATOWN LIBRARY OPENS TO SERVE AS MEMORIAL TO ' COMFORT WOMEN ' TAKEN BY JAPAN IN WWII</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Half a century after as_many as 200 # 000 Asian women were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army , a memorial library has been established in Los Angeles ' Koreatown to carry_on an international campaign to bring justice and reparations for the victims of one of the cruelest chapters in history . Last week ' s opening of the library by the Los Angeles-based Coalition Against Military Sexual Slavery by Japan coincided with the visit of prominent South_Korean human_rights leader Hyo-Chae Lee , who has been instrumental in bringing the issue to the attention of the international community . The library contains books , photos and other materials documenting the government-run brothels , and interviews with survivors . &quot; It ' s ironic that the first memorial to the women should be in America , &quot; Lee said . The retired sociology professor has battled the Japanese and South_Korean governments over the issue of reparations for the victims of what , she said , &quot; can only be defined as a crime of genocide against the Korean people. &quot; Lee is co-chairwoman of the Seoul-based Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan , which is demanding that the Japanese government fully disclose what happened and how many women were involved . It also wants Japan to set_up a program to enable victims to file claims and to pay $ 40 # 000 in reparation to each victim . Looking_at the Koreatown photo exhibit that shows Japanese soldiers lined_up for their turn outside a battlefield brothel , Lee said the brutality committed against the women , 80 % of whom were Koreans , cannot be dismissed simply as one of the &quot; horrors of war &quot; because Korea was a Japanese colony . &quot; Japan ' s crime against the women is unprecedented , even among the brutal war histories of humankind , because this enslavement of Korean women was carried_out systematically as an official policy of the Japanese government , &quot; said Lee , 70 . She says she , too , could have been a victim , had she come from a less privileged background . * Historians believe 100 # 000 to 200 # 000 women from Korea , Taiwan , China , Japan , the Philippines and parts of Southeast_Asia were conscripted by the Japanese government to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese troops from the 1930s to 1945 . After decades of denial , the Japanese government in 1992 admitted its involvement . The admission came_after Asahi Shimbun , one of Japan ' s largest newspapers , printed documentary evidence unearthed in government archives by Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi . Under the growing pressure of international public_opinion , the Japanese government announced a multibillion-dollar program in September to indirectly compensate victims of Japan ' s wartime atrocities by setting_up a foundation that will build and operate youth centers in Asian_countries to train young people , promote exchanges and collect historical materials . News media in Japan and Korea have reported that the Japanese government is considering a plan to establish a $ 100-million , privately financed fund from which to make direct payments to the surviving women . But Lee and other human_rights activists say the reparations must be made by the Japanese government , and accompanied by an individual apology to the survivors . Lee returned to Seoul this week after conferring_with local supporters in time to attend a conference of Japanese and Korean Bar associations to discuss the issue in the South_Korean capital . She and other leaders have been critical of South_Korean President Young-Sam Kim ' s position that his country would take the &quot; high moral ground &quot; by not seeking monetary compensation for the women , and instead pay them monthly stipends from the South_Korean treasury . The local coalition is conducting a petition drive to gather 1 million signatures to submit to the United Nations Commission on Human_Rights when it convenes in February in Geneva . The commission , which has been investigating complaints lodged with the agency by a consortium of human_rights and women ' s groups from South_Korea , Japan , the Philippines and the United States , is expected to have an interim report . Although a commission recommendation is not legally binding , it does have &quot; moral and political authority , &quot; said Charlotte Bunche , director of the Center for Women ' s Global Leadership at Rutgers University , which has been working with the coalition . Bunche said the international pressure has made the Tokyo government come as far as it has . Oaksook Chun Kim , co-leader of the Los Angeles group , who has met with survivors in South and North_Korea , said some of the so-called &quot; comfort women &quot; were 11 and 12 years old . Kim , retired director of the Korean Studies Center at UCLA , said the girls were shipped as &quot; military supplies &quot; and transported on military trains and ships to front_line battlefields where they endured sexual abuses at the hands of Japanese soldiers . Chung-Ja Noh , now 72 , said that when she was 16 she was abducted from her Korean village and taken with 38 other girls to China amid the Sino-Japanese war . The girls were forced to have sexual_intercourse , sometimes with as_many as 30 soldiers a day , she said . Two years ago , during former Japanese Prime_Minister Kiichi Miyazawa ' s state visit to Seoul , Noh overcame the shame and humiliation she had felt_for more_than five decades and joined demonstrators at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul . * Unlike Noh , most &quot; comfort women &quot; did not live to return home after the war , according to Lee and other researchers . They died in the front_lines with their oppressors in China , Manchuria , the Philippines , Burma , Okinawa and the Solomon Islands . Some were killed by Japanese soldiers bent_on destroying evidence , she said . With Japan ' s defeat in 1945 , the remaining women were dumped , according to Chung-Ok Yun , the other co-chairwoman of the Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan . She has researched the subject for two decades and tracked_down dozens of survivors throughout Asia . Young_women , many of them burdened with babies fathered by Japanese soldiers , were left to wander in Asia , she said . Only a_few returned home . In the last three years , at least 400 survivors -- all_in their late 60s and 70s -- have come_forward publicly to recount their nightmares . &quot; I cried a river when I met with survivors , &quot; said Los Angeles attorney Inja Kim , who visited Pyongyang last year . One woman in her 70s told Kim how Japanese soldiers made a group of Korean girls in one &quot; comfort_station &quot; submit to them . &quot; A lieutenant who was met with resistance from one girl , cut_off her arms , legs and head and showed it to the other girls , &quot; Inja Kim said . Attorney Kim , noting Japan ' s announced yearlong period of self-reflection leading to the 50th anniversary of Japan ' s defeat next Aug . 15 , said it ' s time the country stopped evading its &quot; moral , political and legal responsibilities. &quot; &quot; No matter how rich Japan is , it can never stand tall in the community of nations , &quot; she said , as long as it does not clear its past and make_peace with its Asian neighbors . As part of the observance , Kim suggested that the Japanese government create a monument to the victims in the heart of Tokyo . &quot; That should serve as a reminder that this atrocity against women must never repeat itself , &quot; Kim said .</TEXT>
