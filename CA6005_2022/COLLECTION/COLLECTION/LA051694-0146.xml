   <HEADLINE> 50 YEARS LATER , NORMANDY GETS SET FOR 2ND WAVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower launched the Allied invasion of Normandy , the largest amphibious_assault in the history of modern warfare , his decision ultimately came_down to a single factor : the weather_forecast . And now , 50 years later , as the people of Normandy prepare_for the biggest peacetime assault on their narrow roads , picturesque villages and tiny cafes , they too are thinking_about the weather . Once again , it may mean the difference between shining success and soggy disaster . &quot; If the sun is here , that will be the most important thing , &quot; said Henri-Jean Renaud , 59 , a pharmacist in Sainte-Mere-Eglise , where gray-haired American paratroopers will reprise their jump of half a century ago . Outside , as he spoke , the sky was overcast . &quot; A French mess under the sun is great , &quot; he said . &quot; But with rain , it ' s just a terrible mess. &quot; Rain or sunshine , though , ( and one can usually count_on the former ) tens of thousands of World_War_II veterans , joined by President Clinton , Queen Elizabeth_II and other heads_of_state and government , will converge on the bluffs , the villages , the homes and the cemeteries of northern France on June 6 to remember D-day -- the bloody beginning of the end of World_War_II . Normandy is waiting with open arms . American , Canadian and British flags are pasted to the windows of butcher_shops , bread stores , cheese shops , tea salons and cafes . Rows of foreign flags are flying from the cobblestone streets of Bayeux , where a new sculpture of Eisenhower is being put_up on the edge of town . Signs everywhere , in French and English , read , &quot; Welcome to the Liberators. &quot; D-day memorabilia are arriving_at curio shops by the truckload . At the small food_shops , of which France is justly proud , painted scenes of D-day soldiers on the beach stare out from the wrappers of Camembert cheese , Normandy ' s favorite_sons . The wine_merchants are touting a nice little red from Buzet with the label , &quot; Debarquement 1944 &quot; ( Landing 1944 ) . Workers are busily repaving roads , repainting the white_lines and building traffic_circles . They are polishing monuments , cleaning the landing beaches , clipping the graveside grass , installing extra telephone_lines and erecting towers for the television_cameras . Hotels , some of which have been booked solid for the day for the past 10 years , are adding porters and waiters for the onslaught . Everyone expects the region to be utterly overwhelmed by the traffic and the crush of visitors . But no one seems too worried . Many see it as the last opportunity to show their gratitude . &quot; This one is the 50th , the last big one , &quot; said Renaud , who is helping prepare his town ' s welcome for the American paratroopers who rained from the sky on D-day and freed Sainte-Mere-Eglise from German occupation at 4:30 a.m. &quot; These veterans are old now . Many of them will never come_back . And they are all heroes to us. &quot; The official D-day extravaganza is June 6 , and the national_leaders , journalists and , of course , veterans will be moving from cliffs to beaches to towns and back again throughout the day for national and international ceremonies . The highlight will be an afternoon gathering here on Omaha Beach , attended by 30 # 000 veterans and the leaders of the United States , France , Canada , Britain , the_Netherlands , Norway , Poland and Luxembourg . Then , Clinton , who will be staying_on a U.S. military ship offshore , will head for the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach , where 9 # 835 marble crosses and Stars_of_David mark the final resting place of some of the soldiers who helped take that soil . That night , Clinton will join 60 # 000 people for the closing ceremonies in Caen , the region ' s largest city . The most impressive surge of visitors to Normandy is expected on June 5 and 6 , but French officials have estimated that more_than 2 million Americans will come_to France this year , many to see the D-day sites . And the commemorations , which already have begun , will continue until September as each French village stages a celebration to mark its own day of liberation . The festivities come amid an unprecedented period of soul-searching in France . The trial and conviction earlier this year of Nazi collaborator Paul Touvier , the first Frenchman so convicted , sparked a renewed debate over the extent of French collaboration with the Germans . And many French_people are even beginning to say that the_French Resistance , though undeniably heroic and a source of great pride , played a smaller role in the liberation of France than was once thought . In most of Normandy , though , there never have been any illusions about the identity of the liberators . A few cities farther inland , such_as Caen , where the Germans hunkered_down after the D-day invasion , suffered greatly during the Allied shelling . Some people there have mixed feelings about the liberation . But on Omaha Beach , the facts are irrefutable : 3 # 000 American soldiers died in the first hours of D-day on that four-mile stretch of brown sand . Nearby , 225 U.S. Army Rangers braved heavy German fire to climb 100-foot rock cliffs with ropes and take the summit . A hundred and thirty-five of them were killed or wounded . And by the time Paris was liberated at the end of August , 1944 , 37 # 000 Allied troops had lost their lives . &quot; Sometimes , in Paris , you hear people say , ' U.S. , go_home , ' &quot; Renaud said . &quot; But you never hear that here . I know many French_people were killed , and we are proud_of them . But the Americans and the_English didn ' t need the_French Resistance to win . &quot; The Americans ' objective was Berlin , &quot; Renaud added . &quot; We know it was not just for us , that we were just on the way . But even though you call it an ' invasion , ' we still call it ' liberation. ' &quot; At Sainte-Mere-Eglise , the anniversary of D-day has always been a special occasion . Renaud ' s father was the mayor of the city of 1 # 500 at the time of the invasion . For years afterward , Renaud ' s mother , Simone , in fluent English , answered thousands of letters from families of American servicemen and tended their graves . When she died in 1988 , it was front-page news in the newsletter of the U.S. 82nd Airborne . &quot; We ' ve been doing this for 50 years , &quot; Renaud said of the planned welcome . &quot; Each year since D-day , the American flag has been raised here. &quot; Bernard Peschet , who runs the Tom_and_Jerry Army Navy Store in downtown Sainte-Mere-Eglise , says business already is booming . He added the Normandy branch to his Marseilles store two years ago and hasn ' t regretted it . &quot; It ' s just been crazy around here , &quot; Peschet said , smoking a pipe as he watched browsers studying everything from U.S. military_uniforms to Lucky Strike lighters to the tiny metal &quot; clickers &quot; that paratroopers used on D-day to locate each other in the darkness . Although some merchants clearly hope to profit from the influx of visitors , the sense of welcome seems genuine . &quot; I don ' t know about the younger generation , but the people who lived here are really , deeply grateful , &quot; Renaud said . &quot; It ' s not just to make money . The veterans of this war can be proud. &quot; &quot; Of course , there are some who take_advantage for tourism , &quot; said Jean Skrzyniarsz , 54 , who runs a cafe near the cemetery where 21 # 322 Germans are buried in a field of black crosses . &quot; But people around here are really anti-German. &quot; Skrzyniarsz plans to host an American family he met during the 45th anniversary of D-day . But he worries that he won ' t be able to get_to his house , which is_on Omaha Beach , during the festivities because of all_the security surrounding the foreign heads_of_state . &quot; It could be a problem , but I don ' t mind , &quot; he said . &quot; We all like these Americans . What can we do about it ? &quot; Some of the older_French residents of the region , who have welcomed veterans for years , are worried that on the 50th anniversary , the real stars of the show will be lost amid all_the dignitaries . And the_French government , meeting strong local resistance , was forced to back_down a_few weeks ago on a plan to cancel the hotel reservations of several hundred American and Canadian veterans to make room for visiting VIPs . &quot; I live for the people who were here , not for President Clinton or any other visitors , &quot; Renaud said , pausing from work in his busy pharmacy downtown . &quot; It would be a shame if all these VIPs leave a shadow on the real heroes. &quot; The American paratroopers , now in their late 60s and older , are the heroes of Sainte-Mere-Eglise . On the 13th-Century church that gives the town its name , a life-size model of an American paratrooper , complete with parachute , hangs from the steeple . It commemorates Pvt . John Steele , one of the 15 # 000 American paratroopers , who became snared on the church steeple on D-day morning and pretended to be dead to avoid German fire . On June 5 , 37 of those veterans , ages 67 to 82 , will jump again . At first , the_French were reluctant to allow the old_men to jump , and town residents admit they are worried that someone will be hurt . But the government relented when the U.S. military agreed to provide medical and logistics support . At the American cemetery , now technically U.S. soil and run_by the American government , preparations are_well under way for the big day . About 1.5 million people visit the cemetery every year , and the caretaker expects an additional 500 # 000 this year . A few days ago , one French visitor , Monique Gauchet , scrawled a succinct message in the visitors book at the exit . &quot; Thank you , &quot; she wrote , &quot; for all your sacrifices. &quot; * RELATED STORIES : B1 Road Map to the Memorials Here is a sampling of the events being held_in France June 5 and 6 to mark the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Normandy : JUNE 5 1 .
