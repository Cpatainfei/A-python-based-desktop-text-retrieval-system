   <HEADLINE> THE MAN WHO BEFRIENDED THE LITTLE PRINCE ; SAINT-EXUPERY : A BIOGRAPHY , BY STACY SCHIFF ( ALFRED A . KNOPF : $ 30 ; 544 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In France you must never directly ask another person ' s profession , but must pretend instead that work is a veneer , beneath which lies the uncompromised soul . If this seems like a wishful conceit , nonetheless it fits nicely into a society that elevates the young intellect , then traps it in a lifetime of hierarchies . The entrapment has effects more corrosive than those of bad education . Unemployment statistics can only hint at the problem : Beyond the glory of its civilization , beyond the achievements of its elites , everyday France suffers a secret denial of life . Now there is talk_of a four-day workweek . The problem lies not with idleness but with work that can so easily be left_behind . By necessity more_than choice , the_French have become a_people abandoned to vacation . But Antoine de Saint-Exupery , the heroic French pilot and writer , was all_the opposite -- a man abandoned to vocation . He was neither a man of our times , nor sadly , of_his_own . Stacy Schiff makes this clear in her thoughtful and compelling account of his life . Saint-Exupery was born to impoverished aristocrats in 1900 , and he died 44 years later while flying hopeless missions against the Germans over occupied France . Best known as the author of &quot; The Little Prince , &quot; he wrote other successful books , notably &quot; Night Flight &quot; and , in nonfiction , &quot; The Wind , the Sand and the Stars. &quot; As Schiff sketches him , he was a brilliant bear of a man , moody , enthusiastic , childlike , as contradictory as he was uncontrolled . When he conjured_up youth , he did not dwell_on formal schooling but remembered instead the days of imagination and discovery . When he considered manhood , he did not dwell_on Parisian pastimes but reveled in the brutal , faraway work of the early airmail pilot . These apparently exclusive strains twisted uneasily through his life and writings . Saint-Exupery refused to submit to classification . Partly as a result , his political thinking has been called naive . His overwrought musings , his respect for strong leadership , his glorification of &quot; mission , &quot; have opened him to accusations of early fascism . It ' s true that the Nazis embraced his books before later banning them . But the man Schiff describes was no ideologue . He was a disfranchised nobleman , a humanitarian , a wanderer dreaming impractically of a home . If he seemed gullible , it was because in the cockpit and on the page he so powerfully sought purpose . Even when he appeared to advocate self-sacrifice , he was in fact promoting something more personal , work for work ' s sake , as the definition of_his_own existence . It is entirely appropriate that many of his sales , as Schiff admits , are now to vocational_schools . In &quot; Night Flight , &quot; Saint-Exupery wrote_about an old mechanic named Leroux , who &quot; had forty years of work behind him . All his energies were for his work . When at ten o ' clock or midnight Leroux went_home it certainly was not to find a change of scene , escape into another world. &quot; I don ' t know how that sounded in 1931 , but for the_French of today , Saint-Exupery must be a hard read . He is not an easy read for today ' s Americans either . Schiff writes_about the artistry of French expression , the Anglo-Saxon preference for precision , and the difficulties of translation . &quot; What sounds lush in French -- from Chateaubriand to Proust -- will in a poor translation turn purple in English. &quot; She believes Saint-Exupery was lucky to have been_well served by his translators . Indeed the translations have enjoyed great success in the United States . But that begs the point : Even in French , his prose can seem too florid for modern American tastes . Never mind . He is worth reading anyway , if for no other reason than his humanity . He is also worth reading about . Stacy Schiff must agree . This is her first book . She was born after Saint-Exupery ' s death , but writes_about him with the fondness and nuance of a longtime lover . And in_love she is wise . She keeps her language clear , and neither apologizes for Saint-Exupery ' s weaknesses nor joins loudly into arguments for his cause . Instead , she expresses her dedication through the uncompromising quality of_her_own work . The result is a biography like a call from the past . She starts the story during Saint-Exupery ' s years as an airmail pilot on the pioneering route from France to Dakar . In 1927 he was posted to the desolate Spanish fort and airfield at Cape Juby , 600 miles south of Casablanca , on the Sahara ' s wild Atlantic coast . It was there , under difficult conditions , that young Saint-Exupery won the respect of the more seasoned pilots for his courage and austerity . He spent time among Moors , some of whom , then as now , were more inclined to murder Europeans than to submit to them . Saint-Exupery believed_in European superiority . Unlike other writers about the Sahara , he did not romanticize the natives . But he was willing to listen to them . About a man named el Mammun , who massacred the_French officers traveling in his caravan , Saint-Exupery later wrote lines that still stand as the most concise description of Islamic revolt : &quot; He grew old . Growing old , one begins to ponder . Pondering thus , el Mammun discovered one night that he had betrayed the God of Islam and had sullied his hand by sealing_in the hand of the Christians a pact in which he had been stripped of everything. &quot; The pact that Saint-Exupery signed was with publishers . His first novel , &quot; Southern Mail , &quot; came_out in 1929 , and was enthusiastically received . Saint-Exupery paid a heavy price : His arrival as a writer marked the start of an early decline as a pilot . In the small world of French aviation , he had already developed a reputation for vagueness , which now seemed confirmed . Pilots are pragmatists , suspicious of abstraction . They are technicians , uncomfortable with expression . Saint-Exupery was giving_away secrets they did not know they had . They began to exclude him from their fraternity -- as most still do . And they were not wrong . Saint-Exupery was excluding himself . He had begun to dream beyond the cockpit , often while flying . He had foolish accidents . Nonetheless , he was sent_off to organize an airmail route in Argentina , where he stayed for two years . He met his wife there , a wild Salvadoran who for the rest of his life caused him no end of pain . He continued to write . Upon his return he carried with him the manuscript of &quot; Night Flight. &quot; The novel was published in October , 1931 , and was a hit . Within six months his old friends would hardly talk to him , and he had been frozen_out of the flying profession . Soon afterward the airmail company folded . Saint-Exupery spent the rest of his years trying to return to the simplicity of a pilot ' s life and failing brilliantly . He had indeed become a pilot to be distrusted . Late in 1935 he attempted with a mechanic to make a record flight from Paris to Saigon , and crashed into the Libyan_desert . The accident was_due to navigational negligence , the worst sort of piloting stupidity . Not by chance , it led to his strongest work as a writer -- the chapter in &quot; The Wind , the Sand and the Stars &quot; describing the sensations of thirst in the desert , and the thoughts of dying men . &quot; I was perfectly ready to fall_asleep , whether for a night or for eternity . If I did fall_asleep , I could not even know whether it was for the one or for the other . And the peace of sleep ! But that cry that would be sent up at_home , that great wail of desolation -- that was what I could not bear. &quot; Schiff reports another pilot ' s belief that Saint-Exupery lived only in_order to have something to say . The same accusation could be leveled against most writers -- it is a view from the outside , but not entirely unfair . Still , the accident that followed was so shameful that Saint-Exupery never mentioned it in print ; in 1938 during a publicity flight through the Americas , Saint-Exupery crashed on takeoff from Guatemala_City . His error was one no student pilot would make : He had forgotten to check the airplane ' s loading . He and his faithful mechanic were seriously injured . World_War_II saved him for a while . He begged his way into a reconnaissance squadron at the outset but after the occupation of France , found himself grounded in New York for several years . He wrote two books there , including his famous lament for life and childhood , &quot; The Little Prince. &quot; His sadness was not new . Schiff writes , &quot; What Baudelaire described as genius -- childhood recovered at will -- could prove as much a curse as a blessing . For Saint-Exupery it proved a constant occasion for regret . It was telling that he thought_of adulthood as an exile , by far a more painful one than the long desolate months at Cape Juby . . . . A happy childhood , too , takes its hostages. &quot; After the Allied invasion of North Africa , Saint-Exupery returned to the fray and , despite his reputation , managed to talk his way back into the cockpit . He was assigned to his old reconnaissance squadron , now flying unarmed P-38s . The other pilots tried to protect him from himself , finding excuses to keep him from combat . But he insisted on flying , and during his seventh mission , on July 31 , 1944 , he disappeared without a trace . It was not an act of suicide but of submission . The French , too , become what they do . Saint-Exupery must have known he was no longer a pilot . As a writer he finally abstracted life .</TEXT>
