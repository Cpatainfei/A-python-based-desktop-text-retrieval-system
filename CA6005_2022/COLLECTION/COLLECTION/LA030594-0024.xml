   <HEADLINE> ROCK SINGER COBAIN IN DRUG COMA ; MUSIC : NIRVANA ' S LEADER IS HOSPITALIZED IN ROME AFTER OVERDOSE . THE BAND ' S MANAGER REPORTS SIGNS OF RECOVERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kurt Cobain , lead singer for the best-selling rock_band Nirvana , was rushed to a hospital in Rome early Friday after collapsing into a drug-induced coma . The 27-year-old Seattle singer-songwriter -- who has been hailed as a &quot; spokesman for his generation &quot; because of the anger and alienation in his music -- was comatose throughout the morning but began to show signs of recovery by midday . &quot; Kurt opened his eyes , he moved his fingers , and he responded to his name -- those are good signs , &quot; Nirvana manager Janet Billig said after speaking by phone to Cobain ' s wife , Courtney Love , who has been at the singer ' s side since calling paramedics to the rescue . &quot; It ' s very serious , but based on what we ' ve been told by the doctors we are optimistic that he will make a full recovery , &quot; Billig said . Cobain , who canceled concerts Wednesday and Thursday in Germany because of illness , overdosed on a mixture of champagne and &quot; painkillers &quot; in a hotel_room , where he had been recuperating with his wife , who heads the rock_group Hole , and their 2-year-old daughter . Because so many young rock figures , from Jimi Hendrix to Jim Morrison , have died tragically over the years , the rock world braced itself early Friday for the worst as sketchy reports of Cobain ' s overdose surfaced in Italy . Some U.S. radio_stations even reported that he had died . Although the singer has acknowledged taking heroin and other illegal substances in the past , Cobain told The Times in late 1992 that the birth of his child had caused him to swear_off drugs . &quot; I don ' t want my daughter to grow_up and someday be hassled by kids at school . . . . I don ' t want people telling her that her parents were junkies , &quot; he said . Billig said the drugs pumped from Cobain ' s stomach by doctors in the emergency_room of the Umberto I Polyclinic Hospital were prescribed to fight_off influenza and a throat condition . In most cases , doctors rarely prescribe anything stronger than antibiotics to combat flu . But tranquilizers are sometimes given to ease throat problems , medical experts said Friday . The Italian news_agency ANSA said Cobain went_into a coma after combining a large dose of a strong sedative with champagne . The drug , known in Italy by the name Roipnol , is used mostly for insomnia and is not carried by many Italian pharmacies . Billig said she spoke_to Cobain upon his arrival in Rome this week and described him as &quot; in great spirits . He was happy to be going_to Rome . He feels comfortable there and was looking_forward to having some time_off from the tour with his family. &quot; Thanks to Cobain ' s songwriting skills and blaring guitar style , Nirvana went from underground rock cult status to international stardom in 1991 after the release of the group ' s &quot; Nevermind &quot; album . The collection generated more_than $ 120 million in sales worldwide and established Nirvana as a force that changed the course of modern rock ' n ' roll . The group -- whose latest album , &quot; In Utero , &quot; is also a best-seller -- was_on a European tour , following a highly successful U.S. tour last year that included a sold-out date in December at the Forum in Inglewood . Cobain was transferred from the public hospital to a private clinic called the American Hospital . The singer ' s mother , Wendy O ' Connor , told the Daily World in Aberdeen , Wash. , that the singer ' s vital signs were strong and he should recover . &quot; He ' s going_to make_it , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
