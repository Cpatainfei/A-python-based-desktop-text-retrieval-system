   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; CAPITAL_PUNISHMENT HELD UP AS LIFE OR DEATH CAMPAIGN ISSUE ; IN RACES FROM FLORIDA TO CALIFORNIA , POLITICAL RHETORIC FOCUSES ON EXECUTIONS AS A GAUGE OF TOUGHNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles supports capital_punishment . In his 3 1 / 2 years in office the veteran Democrat has presided over eight executions . But now , in his bid for reelection , he is under_attack from likely Republican challenger Jeb Bush for not enforcing the death_penalty aggressively enough . The assault by Bush , a son of former President George_Bush , constitutes an early start on what has become a grisly rite of fall : the executioner ' s song as a central theme in political_campaigns . At a time when concern about crime is high and faith in the criminal justice system is low , the death_penalty once again is emerging as a critical , even dominant , issue in several high-profile campaigns -- particularly gubernatorial elections in some of the largest states . Although even the states most committed to capital_punishment execute only a handful of prisoners annually , political consultants say that support for the death_penalty has become virtually a threshold question for voters assessing candidates ' attitudes toward crime . &quot; Voters understand the death_penalty isn ' t the end-all or be-all , but it says to them : ' We know where a candidate stands , whose side he is &quot; said Democratic media consultant Joe Trippi . &quot; Are you on the side of the victims or , for lack of a better way of putting it : ' Are you an ACLU liberal on the side of the criminals ? ' &quot; That widespread attitude threatens candidates opposed to capital_punishment -- even those who promise to enforce it despite their personal feelings , such_as Democratic gubernatorial nominees Kathleen Brown in California and Dawn Clark Netsch in Illinois . And it is increasing pressure for reinstatement of capital_punishment in some of the 13 states still without it : Kansas earlier this year became the first_state since 1982 to reimpose the death_penalty , and Massachusetts came_close to following . Though capital_punishment typically has been a secondary issue in congressional races , it is roiling some contests this year -- particularly in elections involving supporters of the House crime bill , which in an earlier form would have allowed prisoners facing death to challenge their sentences as racially biased . The &quot; racial justice &quot; provision was dropped_in the House-Senate conference committee that resolved differences in the two chambers ' bills . But earlier votes for the measure may come_back to haunt some Democrats . In one of the two Tennessee Senate_races , Republican Fred Dalton Thompson has already criticized his opponent , Democratic Rep . Jim Cooper , for supporting ( and then reversing his position on ) the racial justice provision . In Kentucky , Republican challenger Ed Whitfield is saying that Democratic Rep . Tom Barlow ' s support for the measure amounted &quot; to trying to abolish the death penalty. &quot; &quot; The mutant child of racial quotas and the death_penalty makes that a potent issue , &quot; said GOP consultant Mike Murphy . For all_the fervor the death_penalty inspires , its practical effect is extremely limited . In 1993 , the federal_government and the states carried_out 38 executions -- and that was the most since the Supreme Court reinstated capital_punishment in 1976 . Even governors like Republicans Jim Edgar in Illinois and Pete Wilson in California , who are stressing the issue in their reelection campaigns , have presided over just two executions each . The length of appeals in capital cases largely explains the infrequency of executions . But not that many criminals are sentenced to death in the first place . Throughout the United States , fewer than 3 # 000 convicts are_on Death Row . From 1990 through 1992 alone , nearly 72 # 000 murders were committed . Even so , public support for capital_punishment remains unshakable : About three-fourths of Americans say they back the death_penalty for murderers , among the highest level of support ever recorded , according to surveys by the Gallup Organization Inc. When the alternative of life without parole is proposed , three-fifths of those say they still prefer the death_penalty , Gallup has found . At the core of support for capital_punishment , surveys show , is less the belief that it deters crime than the conviction that it is just punishment for the most vicious criminals . Voters &quot; regard the death_penalty as justice , &quot; Wilson said flatly in an interview earlier this summer . As a political issue , the death_penalty appeared to crest four years ago when the largest states last elected governors . In Texas that year , gubernatorial candidates in both parties so emphasized their eagerness to carry_out the death_penalty that , someone quipped , voters should eliminate the middleman and just elect the executioner . This year , Texas Gov . Ann Richards and Republican challenger George W . Bush -- another son of the former President -- both support capital_punishment . But in other big-state gubernatorial elections , death is back at center stage . In California , Wilson has used Brown ' s personal opposition to capital_punishment to brand her an &quot; ACLU liberal &quot; and link her to unpopular former state Supreme Court Chief_Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird , who also promised to enforce the law but repeatedly invalidated death sentences on technical grounds . In Illinois , Edgar barraged Netsch in June with $ 700 # 000 worth of television ads highlighting her lifelong opposition to the death_penalty to portray her as soft_on crime . In New York , state Sen . George E . Pataki , the front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination , opened his campaign with ads attacking Gov . Mario M . Cuomo for vetoing legislation to reinstate the death_penalty during each of his 12 years in office . And in Florida , Jeb Bush began his campaign with ads promising that he would speed_up enforcement of the death_penalty -- and sign more death_warrants than Chiles . So far , Edgar ' s attacks appear to have had the most impact . that ' s partly because of the backdrop : In May , after 14 years of appeals , the state executed mass murderer John Wayne Gacy . It was an emotional event that focused enormous attention on the death_penalty . &quot; In focus groups , people said : ' Jesus_Christ , this guy got 14 years to appeal -- that ' s longer than some of his victims were alive , &quot; said Andy Foster , Edgar ' s campaign manager . Netsch is trying to bolster her crime-fighting credentials by urging stricter gun_control and criticizing Edgar for failing in his effort to pass a state ban on assault weapons . But at the time Edgar ' s ads on the death_penalty started running , he led Netsch by 6 percentage_points in private polls ; when they finished , his lead had swelled to 29 points , according to Fred Steeper , Edgar ' s pollster . In New York , the issue ' s effect is less certain . Cuomo stirred controversy this summer when he suggested that state voters be given the opportunity to choose between the death_penalty and life imprisonment without parole ( his preferred alternative ) in a binding referendum . When the New York Times reported that represented a softening of his longstanding opposition to capital_punishment , Cuomo angrily responded with evidence that he had been calling_for such a referendum throughout his political career . But the imbroglio has added_to Cuomo ' s problems in his toughest political challenge since his first election in 1982 . In California , Brown is battling to prevent the death_penalty issue from consuming a campaign that she wants to fight primarily on economic grounds . She has responded to Wilson ' s attacks by firmly promising to carry_out the death_penalty . At the same time , she has fiercely counterattacked on Wilson ' s crime record , accusing him of mismanaging the parole system and reducing the number of police_officers in the state by cutting aid to cities . &quot; What Wilson is trying to do is make crime an ideological issue . . . . &quot; said John Whitehurst , Brown ' s spokesman . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is say crime is an effectiveness issue : Do you feel safer than you did four years ago ? &quot; In Florida , both sides are preparing_for a brawl on the issue if Jeb Bush survives next month ' s GOP primary to become Chiles ' challenger . Bush has highlighted statistics showing that Chiles signed far fewer death_warrants than his Democratic and Republican predecessors . Chiles aides said those figures are misleading because other governors signed death_warrants before prisoners had completed all_of their appeals , forcing courts to issue stays_of_execution . In the sort of macabre competition now common , Chiles is saying that the relevant measure of his commitment to the death_penalty is the eight executions that have occurred on his watch -- just one less than occurred under his Republican predecessor , Bob Martinez . Frank Greer , a political consultant to Chiles , maintained that Jeb Bush is courting a backlash by suggesting to voters that he would execute convicted murderers more quickly . In focus groups around the state , he said , people said that &quot; they were_sick of candidates using it as a political issue . . . . &quot; Still , Greer acknowledged , that ' s scant comfort for candidates who can ' t claim personal support for capital_punishment . &quot; You can still demonstrate toughness and an effective approach if you oppose the death_penalty , &quot; Greer insisted . &quot; But it ' s tough. &quot;</TEXT>
