   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : CRASHING DOLLAR SIGNALS TIME FOR A COUNTERPUNCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Do Americans pay a price for the falling U.S. dollar , which all but collapsed last week , beyond the obvious one of costlier vacations overseas ? And does the chronic trade_deficit , which worsened again last week , exact a serious cost on the U.S. economy , ultimately reducing American living standards ? The answer is yes on both questions , although you would n ' t know that from most expert and official reactions last week . President Clinton protested gamely that the U.S. economy is stronger than it has been in decades , and therefore the dollar ' s weakness was mistaken . &quot; In the end , the markets will have to respond to the economic realities , &quot; the President said . Clinton was right on fundamentals but wrong on markets . The U.S. economy is solid and American industry is highly competitive thanks to many virtuous years of lean diets and tough workouts . His mistake was in saying the world would reward such virtue . Mae West knew better : &quot; Goodness has nothing to do with it , &quot; the roguish actress might have said about foreign trade and economic relations among nations . Nothing happens without effort in those relations . The U.S. dollar has been falling against other currencies for almost a decade now , making U.S. goods cheaper on international markets . Yet the balance_of_trade and international payments continues in deficit as it has since 1977 . Those chronic deficits , totaling more_than $ 1 trillion over 16 years , impose a penalty on the U.S. economy . They force the United States to borrow , at_home and abroad , to finance annual deficits , and that forces interest_rates higher and curbs the potential for U.S. jobs , incomes and living standards . that ' s the backdrop to the situation we find ourselves in today , which is filled with paradox and foreboding . On the one hand , recent high-level visitors to Japan and Asia find disrespect for the Clinton_Administration mounting to a misguided contempt for the United States itself . that ' s one reason the dollar is weak . Yet these same visitors found admiration for U.S. industry ' s competitive strength and vision to be widespread , as if confirming Clinton ' s boasts about it last week . The message , therefore , is that the U.S._government needs firm , knowledgeable policies toward Japan and Asia but is fortunate that U.S. industry gives it a strong hand . A few examples of trade realities will put us in the picture and give an idea of what ' s needed . Most Americans will be surprised to learn that in Japan today , the realization has dawned that Japanese industry is trailing in the all-important information industries of computers and telecommunications . Business_leaders and government ministries acknowledge that American development of personal_computers and software , cable_television , CD-ROMS , the Internet and so on is the way to build the information highway . The wake-up call_for Japanese industry was the growing U.S. ability to combine computers with video , which made Japan ' s high-definition television obsolete . Now Japan ' s government plans massive investments in fiber-optic cables to create an information highway by 2010 . So will we see surging exports of U.S. computers and telecommunications_equipment to Japan ? No . Or will Japan open its economy and allow U.S. telecommunications companies to invest in and take_advantage of a growing market in the world ' s second-largest economy ? No . Instead , Japan ' s government is trying to turn_back the clock to the postwar era of government planning and targeted industries . The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications plans to organize its Big Three telephone suppliers , Fujitsu , NEC and Hitachi , in efforts to produce advanced telecommunications products for the home market and export . The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has its own plans for what it calls &quot; visual information technology. &quot; U.S. and other foreign competitors need not apply . What should be the U.S. response ? Calm judgment and sharp elbows . First of all , realize that the old Japanese model of government-guided industry probably won ' t work . Decades of government guidance haven ' t given Japan a competitive computer_industry . Japan ' s banks are ruled and guided by the powerful Ministry of Finance , but that didn ' t prevent them from making more_than $ 200 billion in bad loans , notes Eugene Dattel , author of &quot; The Sun That Never Rose , &quot; a new book on Japan ' s financial system . Use sharp elbows . As it happens , Fujitsu , Hitachi and NEC are all bidding for inclusion in information highway projects in the United States . &quot; A word from Undersecretary of Commerce Jeff Garten demanding reciprocity in Japan if those companies are to get business here could do wonders , &quot; says a U.S. expert on Japan . What is called_for from Washington is a serious , knowledgeable policy on trade . A critical period is coming_up in the automobile_industry as a new labeling law tightens definitions of just how many U.S. auto parts Japanese manufacturers are buying here . U.S. sources say the new definitions will reveal that Toyota , Honda and Nissan buy about half their parts from U.S. suppliers , but resolutely import all high-value parts such_as transmissions from suppliers back in Japan . If true , the Japanese manufacturers should be called_on that . Buying more sophisticated parts in the United States would create better jobs for Americans and help correct the trade_deficit with Japan , two-thirds of which is in automobiles and parts . On the other hand , if Japan opened_up its vast economy -- two-thirds the size of the U.S. economy -- the result would be better jobs and a better life for the majority of Japan ' s people . Don ' t expect miracles . &quot; Japan regards trade differently from the United States , &quot; writes Glen Fukushima , a former U.S. trade representative who is now in private business in Tokyo . &quot; Competitiveness is not only a matter of price and quality , but of a host of other factors , very much including what is seen as best for Japan. &quot; But so what ? If Japan ' s policy works to the disadvantage of the United States , the Clinton_Administration has a responsibility to insist on U.S. interests . Unfortunately , the Administration , from the President himself down to trade negotiator Mickey Kantor , is seen in Asia today as ignorant and weak . &quot; Japanese friends of the United States say firm action , on trade or other matters , is needed to restore respect and confidence , &quot; reports a recent visitor to Tokyo . Clearly , the times are demanding change . Last week ' s careening dollar said the years of deficits and drift cannot go_on ; it was our wake-up call .</TEXT>
