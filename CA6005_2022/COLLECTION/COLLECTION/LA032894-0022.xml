   <HEADLINE> CIGARETTE BAN NOT FULL ANSWER , ELDERS DECLARES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cigarettes should be regulated by federal health officials , but banning them &quot; would not solve the problem &quot; because millions of Americans already are addicted to nicotine , Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders said Sunday . Elders said she supports Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A . Kessler ' s efforts toward regulating cigarettes as delivery systems for nicotine . &quot; I ' m not sure they would have to ban them , but I certainly think they would have to say cigarettes are addictive , we ' d have to tell people that they kill , they would need to know the ingredients so they could make a decision about it , &quot; she said on CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of a House health subcommittee , said : &quot; The regulations we ' re going to have to adopt at the congressional level will be to have a nicotine-free cigarette or , if it has any nicotine in there , a warning label about the addictive qualities of nicotine. &quot;</TEXT>
