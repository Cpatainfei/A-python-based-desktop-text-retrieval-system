   <HEADLINE> THE SECOND COMING OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATORS ; MOTOROLA PRODUCT PRESAGES DAWNING OF A NEW GENERATION OF DIGITAL DEVICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call them personal communicators or call them digital assistants . The little gadgets have a penchant for promising social revolution and ending_up as expensive toys . Remember Sharp ' s pocket organizer , the Wizard ? How about the Bookman , Sony ' s portable CD_player for reading books , and the Fujitsu Poquet , a pocketbook-size computer ? Unless you ' re a gadget-freak , you probably don ' t . Last year , EO ' s personal communicator and Apple ' s Newton Messagepad were added_to the electronic clutter . Both products have sold in small numbers relative to the huge publicity that preceded them . Still , don ' t be too quick to dismiss these widgets . A new generation of products with built-in communications capabilities is_on its way with the March 7 unveiling of a machine from Motorola based on a new operating_system . These new products will find homes with a small but growing band of mobile executives whose long hours on_the_road or time-sensitive business dealings make_it important to receive and respond to faxes and electronic_mail quickly no matter where they are or what they are doing . As the infrastructure for wireless communications improves and as new software applications become available , you may yet wake_up one day to discover that a single gadget can act_as your date book , pager , note pad , calculator and cellular_phone . Link Resources , a New York-based research company , predicts sales of portable communications devices will begin to take_off next year as better products are introduced , reaching 5 million annual units in 1998 , up from the 779 # 000 devices sold last year . Japanese consumer electronics_companies , which have gone_through a long barren period without any hit products , are excited by the market ' s potential . Mickey Shulhoff , president of Sony Corp . of America , said he would n ' t be surprised if , by 2005 , these devices are found in 40 % of U.S. households . Sony has created a new division dedicated to design , manufacture and sell the personal communicators it plans to unveil in the fall , giving the product category the same weight , organizationally at least , as the company ' s $ 4-billion consumer electronics division . Meanwhile , personal digital assistants have flopped grandly enough to be the subject of derision in the Doonesbury comic_strip . &quot; The first product is never the realization of the dreams of its inventors , &quot; says Marc Porat , chief_executive of General Magic , a start-up backed by , among others , Sony , Matsushita , Motorola and AT &amp; T . General Magic has developed software on which a new generation of products will be based . &quot; It was true for radio and television , and it will continue to be true for personal communicators , &quot; Porat said . Clearly a lot has to happen before this market takes_off . Take price . Motorola ' s new device is expected to sell for slightly less than $ 1 # 000 . It will include a built-in wireless modem . &quot; Nobody wants to spend $ 1 # 000 for a smart telephone or an organizer , &quot; said Bruce Lupatkin , an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist , a San Francisco investment_firm . Then there is the communications software . A truly useful device would automatically make the necessary connections to tap corporate databases , collect e-mail or send voice messages , said Mark Eppley , president of Travelling Software , whose software is embedded in many of the devices . Add_to this the cost of subscribing_to a wireless communications service so you can send and receive data . Today it costs $ 75 a month to subscribe_to a service such_as Ram Mobile Data . Last and very far from least , there is the lack of software available for the machines to make them perform useful functions . But these obstacles could fall quickly . McCaw Cellular predicts that by the end of the year , you will be able to subscribe_to a wireless service that will enable you to pick_up e-mail or get stock quotes sent to your personal communicator for as little as $ 20 a month . Forrester Research predicts that the devices themselves could fall to $ 200 , one-fifth of this year ' s price , by 1998 . Many of the new-generation devices that don ' t come_with built-in communications will have standardized slots into which credit-card-size wireless modems or pagers can be plugged_in . As for applications , the move toward software standards is making_it increasingly attractive for software houses to develop programs for these devices . In addition to the Newton software , which Apple recently agreed to license to other manufacturers , two other companies are aggressively pushing into this market and are expected to eclipse the Newton as industry standards . * The more approachable system comes from General Magic . It offers a friendly interface and the ability to use &quot; intelligent agents , &quot; little packets of codes that , with simple instructions , will go searching through computer_networks for information . Porat says he has long wanted to see Madonna but could never remember to get tickets on_time . Once the various services are in place , Magic Cap will enable the user to send an intelligent agent into the system with orders to buy tickets the next time Madonna comes_to town -- and to make_sure the time doesn ' t conflict with his schedule . The first devices from Sony and Motorola will run_on General Magic ' s Magic Cap software . The other major challenger in the field is Microsoft . Playing_on its strength in personal_computers , Microsoft is promoting the personal communicator market as a &quot; companion &quot; to the personal_computer , aimed primarily at business_executives who want wireless access to their computers whether they are out of town on business or wandering the hallways outside their offices . The move toward a_few key software standards has encouraged software houses to write for the devices . In spite of the bad publicity that has accompanied poor sales of the Newton and the EO , software houses are rushing into the market . Apple says it has already sold more_than 2 # 800 kits to help developers create software for the Newton . Albert Chu , director of product planning and strategy at Apple ' s personal interactive electronics division , says there are now 27 packages available on the system , and there will be 100 applications available by the end of summer . Among the more interesting applications : a package that turns the Newton into a mini-teleprompter , allowing the user to scroll through a speech at a comfortable speed . Software available for Magic Cap devices include an interpreter for travelers , Intuit ' s popular Quicken personal finance program , an Official Airline Guides package for checking fares and seat availability and a spreadsheet . &quot; We have been through several generations of these machines , &quot; said Faruq Ahmad , vice_president at PenWare Inc. , the spreadsheet company . He has used the Motorola device soon to be unveiled and is suitably impressed . Now that the machines have built-in communications capabilities enabling users to pull information out of their office computers , &quot; this market will start to take_off , &quot; Ahmad said . * Microsoft is a latecomer to the market ; products using its software are not_due out until year-end . But it has already held conferences and created tools to help companies build portable extensions to their Windows software_packages . &quot; The important thing is to get access to the information running_on your desktop , &quot; said Bruce Baker , Microsoft ' s general_manager of hand-held systems . He envisions people using the portable devices to browse through and pick_out files or read mail while they are_on the road or walking_around their offices . While General Magic ' s &quot; intuitive &quot; approach may make_it a stronger contender in the long_run for the non-technical user , Baker argues that it will be a long_time before the market extends beyond business . Both companies agree that the key function that will drive these new-generation devices is e-mail . Not long ago , e-mail use was restricted to technical people , or those working in large corporations with in-house systems . Now hundreds of thousands of new users each month are tapping into on-line systems to send electronic messages . &quot; With these devices , it will be like sending electronic Post-its , &quot; Porat said . A major technical problem has always been how to get data into the devices without a keyboard . The Newton and EO were supposed to solve the problem using a technology called handwriting recognition . The user scribbles letters directly onto a screen for the computer to translate into letters or numbers that can then be manipulated by computer . The technology has proved cumbersome and slow . General Magic tries to avoid the problem by offering visual cues and a touch screen . When data entry is absolutely necessary , you touch letters on a projection of a keyboard on the small screen . AT &amp; T ' s EO is minimizing that problem by targeting its next product as a simple-to-use &quot; smart cellular_phone &quot; with such additional features as e-mail and faxing , rather than a computing device with varied uses . Apple ' s Chu said the primary market for these devices over the next year will be in applications custom-developed for specific companies . He said there are already 100 major corporations developing software to use the Newton in-house . As more software , including games , becomes available for the devices , Chu said , the market will broaden . Meanwhile , the products could continue to face tough times . In response to General Magic and Microsoft ' s criticism of the Newton ' s performance , Chu said : &quot; They haven ' t even shipped product yet . When they get_to the market , they will find a different reality. &quot;</TEXT>
