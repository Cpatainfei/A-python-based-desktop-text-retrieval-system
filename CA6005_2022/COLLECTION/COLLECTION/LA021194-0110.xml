   <HEADLINE> MARC OF EXCELLENCE GIRARDELLI , THE ONE-MAN GANG FROM LUXEMBOURG , SAYS WORLD CUP TITLES MEAN MORE THAN OLYMPIC GOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smaller than our Rhode Island , that speck of a state , Luxembourg measures 999 square_miles and asks that you consider every square_inch . It boasts a 100 % literacy rate and one of the world ' s highest standards_of_living . What it can ' t produce , it imports , from commodities as varied as alloys to Alpine skiers . On the map , Luxembourg looks_like an ink splat on the borders of Belgium , Germany and France . Yet , the nation of 400 # 000 is fiercely protective . And no subject is touchier than that of its most beloved sportsman , Marc Girardelli , the greatest Alpine skier in the world today , perhaps ever . Under the flag of Luxembourg , the five-time World Cup overall champion has won everything there is to win in skiing except an Olympic gold medal . Girardelli is the Winter_Olympics in Luxembourg . He is the nation ' s only representative here , where he will try again to become the first gold-medal winner from Luxembourg since 1952 . If a man was ever a country , it is Girardelli . In last year ' s final Nation ' s Cup , he finished seventh in the men ' s overall division , totaling more World Cup points than the countries of Canada , Germany and the United States . It matters not that there are few mountains to speak_of in Luxembourg , no ski academies or , for that matter , much recreational interest in skiing . It matters not that Girardelli lives in Switzerland , not Luxembourg , and does not take his Luxembourg citizenship all that seriously . It is enough for Luxembourg that Girardelli stops by to pick_up his mail . * You will never have visa problems in Luxembourg as long as you never mention that Girardelli is Austrian born . Do so in a public arena and you will probably receive correspondence on premium bond stationary and embossed letterhead from Alphonse Berns , ambassador of the Grand_Duchy of Luxembourg to the United States . Berns is protector of Luxembourg ' s interests abroad ; that is , protector of Girardelli . &quot; I take_exception that people continue to mention that he is Austrian born and runs_for Luxembourg , &quot; Berns said from his offices in Washington . &quot; In fact , Girardelli went_through the whole procedure to become a Luxembourger . It was pretty tough . We consider him a true Luxembourger . I have never heard in this country the reference_to the ' Czech-born Martina Navratilova. ' &quot; Girardelli did not dock in Luxembourg with grand designs to bolster its international image or GNP . The motivation to move was the scheme of Marc ' s cantankerous father , Helmut , who wanted the best for his talented skier-son , even if it meant pulling_up stakes at the greatest ski academy in the world -- Austria . When Marc was 11 , he was defeating all comers in ski_races in and around his hometown of Lustenau . Girardelli had spunk . When asked as a child if he wanted to meet David Zwilling , the 1974 world champion in downhill , Marc declined , saying he preferred to wait until Zwilling asked_for his autograph . Austrian ski officials got_wind of kid wunderbar and insisted he enroll in a special boarding ski school in Schruns , 30 miles from home . Girardelli ' s father preferred that Marc stay home . Helmut , a hotel owner , had been training Marc himself with techniques that later some would consider revolutionary . After a last-straw dispute with the Austrian ski federation , Helmut decided in 1976 to take his 12-year-old and leave home . Switzerland seemed nice . Germany , perhaps . But Helmut didn ' t know anyone in those countries . He did have a government contact in Luxembourg , though , Aime Knepper , who arranged for Marc to ski there . With one considerable snag . Girardelli would be welcome as a racer , but not as a citizen , making him ineligible to compete for Luxembourg in Olympic or world championship competition . Girardelli established residence in Luxembourg but the citizenship process took nearly 10 years , depriving him of opportunities to compete in the 1980 and 1984 Winter_Olympics . Even so , Girardelli says he has never regretted leaving his homeland . &quot; That was necessary , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m not such a nationalist . The color of the passport is not very important. &quot; There were discussions in Luxembourg about exempting Girardelli from the normal citizenship process , but the government ultimately denied him any special favors . &quot; that ' s why I hate the implicit references of his Luxembourg nationality as something you just have to show_up in some office and you get , &quot; Ambassador Berns says . Girardelli , renouncing his Austrian birthright , became a citizen of Luxembourg in 1985 . While Luxembourg hangs_on his every turn , Girardelli maintains that winning an Olympic gold medal is not important to him . Before the 1984 Sarajevo Games , in which he could not participate , Girardelli won five of eight World Cup slaloms and would have been a favorite for the gold . &quot; I don ' t think it was right , &quot; he says of his exclusion . &quot; 1984 was one of my best seasons. &quot; Injuries before the 1988 Calgary Games doomed his medal chances there . Girardelli did win two silver medals , in giant slalom and super-G , at the 1992 Albertville Games . He says winning World Cup overall titles are the true indicator of his dominance . As is his custom , Girardelli started slowly this season but has come_on strong of late and ranks third in the World Cup overall behind Norway ' s Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Italy ' s Alberto Tomba . After the Lillehammer Games , Girardelli will resume his chase for an unprecedented sixth overall title . When asked about the Olympics , Girardelli scoffs that his silver medals aren ' t even made of silver . &quot; At least the World Cup bowl is made of real glass , &quot; he says . Recently , he reiterated those feelings in statements reprinted by Ski_Racing , the International ski journal . &quot; Are there Olympics this year ? &quot; Girardelli was quoted as saying . &quot; The athletes are not very important in the Olympics or World Championships . What is important is the opening ceremony , the closing ceremony , the lodging of the journalists and some parties. &quot; Another Olympic chip for that shoulder , Marc ? Within the sport , Girardelli is considered by many the greatest all-around skier in Alpine history . Not only does he ski all four disciplines -- slalom , GS , super-G and downhill -- he is a threat to win any race he enters . Included among his 43 World Cup victories are three downhills , 16 slaloms , 10 giant slaloms , seven super-Gs and eight combined events . With his super-G victory at Wengen , Switzerland , in January , Girardelli moved_into second place on the all-time World Cup victory list behind Sweden ' s Ingemar Stenmark , a slalom specialist who retired with 86 victories . &quot; He ranks up there with the best in the world , all time , &quot; longtime skiing analyst Bob Beattie says . Yet , in some minds , Girardelli ' s place in history will be judged by his Olympic success . Beattie , who knows the skier well , says one should not put much stock in Girardelli ' s bad-mouthing of the Olympics . &quot; It ' s great protection for racers , &quot; Beattie said . &quot; Very few of them say , ' This is my dream , to win the medal , ' because they know it ' s so tough , a crapshoot . It ' s great to say the goal is the World Cup because they have so many shots at it . I ' ve heard this story so many times , and I don ' t buy it. &quot; Dare we guess what a gold medal would mean to Luxembourg ? * Girardelli , 30 , is running_out of runs . His body has more bumps than a mogul course , yet he keeps coming_around the mountain . Actually , there should never have been a ski star named Girardelli , and thus , none of this political wrangling . His should have been the story of the promising career cut_short in 1983 when , after a crash , his left knee was all but reduced to hamburger . &quot; Many people told me to look_for another job , &quot; Girardelli says now . He tore every ligament in the knee , the tendon that extends through the knee and cartilage on either side . The famed surgeon to the skiers , Richard Steadman , who performed the four-hour operation , says he has never seen anything quite like Girardelli ' s recovery . &quot; that ' s an understatement , &quot; Steadman said . &quot; No one has ever come_back to the level he ' s come_back with that kind of injury . Nobody. &quot; Two weeks after surgery , Girardelli hobbled away from Steadman ' s office on crutches . Steadman told Girardelli he could do some light knee bends . Two weeks later , Girardelli returned and reported to Steadman that he had been doing 100 half knee bends daily . Three months later , Girardelli phoned Steadman and wondered if he could begin skiing on his good leg . Steadman gave him the OK . Soon after , Steadman received a picture in the mail of Girardelli skiing on the surgically repaired leg . &quot; He didn ' t disregard it , &quot; Steadman says of the rehab program he designed for Girardelli . &quot; He just carried it to the extreme . He stayed within the guidelines , but he pushed it pretty far. &quot; Steadman says that Girardelli is one of the finest athletes he has ever encountered . &quot; He ' s very powerful . He would have made a fantastic running_back in the NFL . There are two things that set him apart : His ability to focus is as_good_as anyone I ' ve ever seen in sports , and his power. &quot; Despite a career beset with injures , Girardelli keeps plowing back . In 1987 , he dislocated his shoulder so severely he thought his career might be over . He made_it through the World Cup season only with the help of an Egyptian nerve specialist , Mohamed Khalifa . With the bum shoulder , Girardelli still managed to win gold in combined at the world championships . After the season , Steadman performed a five-hour operation to repair the damage Khalifa could not . The hit parade : In 1988 , Girardelli damaged ribs . In 1989 , he injured his kidney and bruised his right knee and suffered a concussion . In 1990 , he underwent surgery to repair torn muscles and internal bleeding in his left leg . Last season , Girardelli raced the last eight races with a torn knee ligament . Like the Buffalo Bills , Girardelli keeps coming_back , like it or not . Girardelli ' s workout regimen is legendary . Beattie says American skiers should take_notes . &quot; The guy is so tenacious , &quot; Beattie said . &quot; He ' s one of the strongest kids I ' ve ever known . Last year , at the end of the season , he took 10 days_off , then went_back to training . There is a lesson there for everybody . The one thing you can do something about is conditioning . He does everything possible he can do to be as_good_as he can be. &quot; * There is no telling how Girardelli might have fared had he stayed in the Austrian system . He certainly would have been a star , but , given the fierce competition and plethora of Austrian specialists , you wonder if he could have fought through the crowds to win five overalls . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; Girardelli says . &quot; Maybe I would have won seven or eight . I won many races when I was still with the Austrians. &quot; Girardelli doesn ' t know how much longer he can keep going , but if he happens to claim a gold medal for Luxembourg , you can bet a certain Washington ambassador will be scanning the news services to make_sure Luxembourg -- all 999 square_miles -- gets its due . Berns says , &quot; Contrary to other sportsmen who have changed nationalities , it has to be said that Girardelli has never competed in an international event for any other country than Luxembourg. &quot; It has been said .</TEXT>
