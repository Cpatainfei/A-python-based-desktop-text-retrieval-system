   <HEADLINE> PROBLEMS OF OVERPOPULATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The article on population , &quot; Doomsayers of Overpopulation Sound a New Jeremiad &quot; ( June 7 ) , seems to imply that if the developed countries , such_as the United States , would reduce their overconsumption , the world could accommodate a much larger population . What wasn ' t mentioned is that the developing countries all want to emulate our lifestyle and are working hard to get_it . What all_of this means is that we are giving ourselves false comfort if we think that we can solve the world ' s population problems by simply reducing our consumption . Even if we did succeed in passing more and more restrictive laws to control consumption , we will have lost some more of our freedoms and likely will have suffered a lowering of our quality_of_life besides . In the very important U.N. Conference on Population and Development to be held_in Cairo in September , I hope our delegates emphasize that : * They have to plan for a world of at least 9 billion to 10 billion people , not the current 5.6 billion people , since it will be almost impossible to stop population growth before then . * International migration is less and less a solution for overpopulation since more countries , like the U.S. , are resisting immigration . * The focus for population stabilization discussions should be around optimum population country by country , not the maximum that the world might be able to feed . * The more prosperous the world becomes , the fewer people the Earth can sustain . Technology can help reduce the impact of prosperity to a certain extent , but some things technology can ' t solve , like the overcrowding of the natural scenic wonders . * Only by stabilizing and cooperatively reducing the number of people in the world over time will the poor of the world have a chance to achieve their aspirations . Our current and future overpopulation will be solved , either by planning and cooperation or by war , pestilence and starvation . The choice is up_to us . CHARLES T . ROTH Fountain Valley * Fortunately , overall U.N. data gives a very different picture than the population article of June 7 . Population growth ? This year , the rate of population growth , 1.6 % , has fallen to the lowest level in modern history . It will drop to about 1.0 % within about 25 years , then drop to zero , then be replaced by world population decline . Why ? This year there will be fewer births in areas such_as Latin_America and East Asia than in 1993 . The average fertility_rate in developed countries such_as the U.S. fell below replacement level 20 years ago and has continually dropped since . The Asian and African fertility_rates are expected to be cut nearly in half in a generation . Why ? There are about 25 factors that are known to decrease the fertility_rate and all 25 are acting to decrease the fertility_rate . Food ? Since 1947 , developing countries have improved their diet by more_than 40 % . Since 1960 , they have increased the number of calories in an average diet by more_than 500 per day . The average diet in each of the 20 most populous countries in the world exceeds U.S._government recommendations for a healthy diet . The world is using less than 25 % of its potential cropland . Resources ? The reserves of every important resource increase as time goes_on and the price adjusted for inflation decreases . Energy reserves such_as oil and natural_gas are at record high levels . Quality_of_life ? The U.N. measures quality_of_life more_than 40 ways , and quality_of_life is improving and is better in more crowded countries and areas in all 40 ways . ROBERT L .
