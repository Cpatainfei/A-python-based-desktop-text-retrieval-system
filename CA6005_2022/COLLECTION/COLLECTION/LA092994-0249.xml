   <HEADLINE> DOCTOR LOSES LICENSE OVER DRUG CHARGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A doctor accused of prescribing narcotic painkillers for patients at Olive View-UCLA Medical_Center and then injecting herself with the drugs has had her medical license revoked by state regulators . Dr. Monica Watts Hurtado , formerly a first-year resident at the county-run hospital in Sylmar , ordered nurses to prepare two shots of Demerol for patients but took one herself and gave the patient a second shot of saline_solution she secretly prepared , state investigators said . Hurtado was fired from Olive View in 1991 after switching needles on five or six patients , according to charges filed by the Medical Board of California . She worked_at the hospital ' s busy gynecology and obstetrics department after graduating from the UCLA School_of_Medicine in 1989 . Last year , Hurtado , 31 , was arrested at a San Bernardino residence as she mixed an injection of heroin for herself in the bathroom , accompanied by her infant son , according to medical board documents . Police said she admitted she was a heroin user and had numerous needle marks on her arm . The medical board in June revoked Hurtado ' s license by default after she failed to demand a hearing to defend herself on charges that she fraudulently prescribed drugs for patients but took them herself . The board released documents on the case this week . State Deputy Atty . Gen . E . A . Jones , who had been assigned to prosecute Hurtado , said Wednesday that apparently no Olive View patients suffered because Hurtado had diverted pain-suppressing medications . &quot; It may have been a situation where patients didn ' t really need ( Demerol ) but she prescribed it anyway , &quot; he said . An Olive View spokeswoman said patients probably were not injured by the saline shots because the solution is harmless . Hurtado could not be reached for comment . The medical board could not provide information Wednesday on what , if any , jobs were held by the physician after she was dismissed from Olive View . State investigators said that in April , 1991 , Hurtado ordered a nurse to prepare two shots of Demerol for a patient . With Hurtado in the patient ' s room , the nurse placed one syringe on a desk and turned_to administer the other . Later , a supervising nurse saw a syringe on the desk with the needle improperly pointing_out . After the first nurse said she did not leave the needle in that position , it was tested and found to contain salt solution instead of Demerol . Hurtado later admitted that on five or six occasions she prescribed two doses of Demerol for patients , one larger and one smaller , according to board documents . She said she gave the larger Demerol shot to herself . She was fired from the hospital in May , 1991 . In May , 1993 , Hurtado tried to pass an altered prescription for the narcotic painkiller Vicodin at a drugstore in Highland , state officials said . A pharmacist summoned San Bernardino County sheriff ' s deputies . After Hurtado was arrested on heroin charges in June , 1993 , she was placed in a diversion program aimed at treating medical professionals addicted to drugs or alcohol . She was also ordered to stop practicing medicine for one year . But she was dropped from diversion for failing to complete the treatment program , state investigators said .</TEXT>
