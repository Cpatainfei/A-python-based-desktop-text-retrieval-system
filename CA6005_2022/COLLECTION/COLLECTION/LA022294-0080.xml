   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; ITALY HAS NO LUCK AT STOPPING THE PUCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The hockey_game here at the Great Eastern Forum was , oh , only four minutes old , but already I was humming , &quot; Na na na na . Na na na na . Hey , hey , hey . Arrivederci . &quot; USA 7 , Italy uno . Team Italia ' s goaltender , David ( Do I Believe in Miracles ? No , I Believe in Getting My Butt Back to the Bench Where It ' s Safe ) Delfino , was out there doing his remarkably realistic impersonation of the Holland tunnel . About the third time one of the United States ' shots went_through his wickets like a croquet_ball , the Italian coach whispered into the ear_hole of David ' s goalie mask , &quot; Psst . You ' re supposed to keep your legs closed . &quot; Italia , I tell ya . Not much in the ol ' puck-stoppage department . Even after Delfino was told to take the rest of the day_off and his relief netminder , Bruno Campese , came_in to blow the save , I sensed that the Americans had not , with this easy victory here in ice land , given a sound thrashing to the NHL ' s version of a Dream Team . Matter_of_fact , I ' ve got 10 kroner in my pocket that says Jordan , Johnson , Barkley , Ewing , Robinson and Bird could whip the Italian hockey_team themselves , by maybe , say , 6-1 . Bird could sprawl in the goal crease on his tummy and stop more pucks than Delfino and Campese . Trouble is , a tougher foe awaits the men on skates for the States . It ' s the Big Blue Machine . The new bad boys of the rink . The Finland Empire . With a game to be played Wednesday that worries him plenty , the U.S. coach , Tim Taylor , said after Monday night ' s game , &quot; It ' s a little bit of a David and Goliath story. &quot; This quote was passed along to Garth Snow , who is one of the American goalies and not the guy Dana Carvey played in those &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; films . Snow said , &quot; Who ' s David and who ' s Goliath ? &quot; Ah . Good question . See , neither Garth nor I thought we would ever come_to a Winter_Olympics where we would hear anybody referring to Finland as Goliath . I have been following international sports for a long_time and , to be painfully candid , I ' ve never even heard anybody refer to Finland as David . We don ' t do a whole_lot of referring to Finland in_general , frankly . For some reason , however , nobody noticed before this particular Olympics that when none of us was looking , Finland put_together one pretty darn fine hockey club . I ' m not sure how this happened . Somebody over there at Helsinki Square Garden really did his homework . Here in Lillehammer , the first nine days of the hockey competition produced one major surprise , that being everybody who got_in the Finns ' path being absolutely Zamboni ' d . I mean , these guys beat the Russians the way the Russians used to beat Belgium . It wasn ' t even close . That red_light went_on so often behind the Russian goalie , he thought he ' d been pulled over . Even the Finnish coach has been going_around crowing how he ' s got the finest team in the tournament . He ' s done everything but say , &quot; Put it in three-inch type . We will win the Olympics ! &quot; Taylor didn ' t exactly wave the white_flag of surrender . He waved a red , white and blue_flag . He said something like , you know , we ' ve done_it before , we can do_it again . He understated the situation , though , when he said : &quot; They ' ve dominated all their opponents . You have to give him bragging rights so far . His team ' s been the dominant team from the start. &quot; And here ' s something for you folks with short attention_spans . Our 1980 USA miracle hockey_team did not defeat Russia to win the gold medal . Our 1980 USA miracle hockey_team defeated Finland to win the gold medal . The date was Feb . 24 , the place Lake Placid and the score 2-1 after two periods , in favor of the Finns . How soon we forget . The game against Russia -- excuse me , the USSR -- was played_on a Friday afternoon , 5 o ' clock , two days before . The American public still had to sweat out that Sunday matinee , which wasn ' t in the bag until Phil Verchota , Rob McClanahan and Mark Johnson slapped shots past Finland ' s goalie for a 4-2 victory to remember . ( Or to forget , as_many have. ) Poor Finland suffered so_much from that defeat , it didn ' t even win a medal . It placed fourth . Second at Calgary in 1988 , the Finns slipped to seventh place four years later at Albertville . But they are back , believe me . And even though the Americans looked pretty slick in their latest game , what with Peter Ciavaglia , Peter Ferraro and David Sacco peppering that poor Italian goalie until he was given the hook , I ' m not sure that their defeating Finland this Wednesday would n ' t be right up there with that 1980 game . Not in impact , I suppose , but in Great Upsets of Olympic Hockey history , yes . What can I say ? We ' re not Goliath , Garth . Taylor , the coach , said : &quot; Our guys have to get their chests out and their American pride up. &quot; And keep their legs closed .</TEXT>
