   <HEADLINE> REVITALIZE THE NAACP ' S FLICKERING FLAME ; CIVIL RIGHTS : NO MATTER WHO HEADS THE GROUP , ITS FOCUS MUST BE TO REACH_OUT TO THE POOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The firing of NAACP Executive_Director Benjamin Chavis was a watershed incident that may force a dramatic restructuring of the NAACP to reflect the needs of poor African Americans . The internal dissension may also foreshadow the creation of an alternative civil-rights organization . Long before Chavis took the reigns of leadership from his conservative predecessor Benjamin Hooks , the organization had passed its zenith , overshadowed by the oratory of Jesse Jackson and upstaged by the boldness of politicians such_as Rep . Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) . Local black leaders , even those of questionable integrity like Al Sharpton of New York were confronting bigots at ground_level in Bensonhurst and Howard Beach , while better-educated African Americans like Julian Bond were addressing corporate America in high-rise boardrooms . Jackson , Waters , Sharpton and Chavis speak face to face with the poorest of black people about keeping hope alive . Although some local chapters have developed reputations for direct community action , national board_members too often commiserate only with each other behind closed doors or in conference with businessmen or politicians aspiring to high office . Multiple strategies are essential but not necessarily effective over the long term unless they take_place within a unified organizational structure that involves blacks of all economic classes . As author Clarence Lusane suggests in &quot; African Americans at the Crossroads , &quot; it is time for blacks to establish public-policy lobbies , political-training institutes and community forums of various perspectives to help revitalize our flickering civil-rights campaign to focus_on the heinous crimes of racism and self-deprecation . This unity of purpose and styles is what Chavis was trying to achieve in organizing a summit of African American leaders and the reason he claims he was fired . His imprudent handling of the NAACP ' s money and a related sexual-harassment allegation cannot be swept aside . Still , when he reached_out to a broader community of African Americans -- the purpose for which he was hired -- he was accused of abandoning the integrationist civil-rights agenda . Ironically , Chavis ' first act_upon assuming leadership was to open the doors to Latinos and other people_of_color . But Latinos did not join , nor did anyone else . Membership in the NAACP , which was low before his appointment , continues its precipitous decline . There is probably very little that can be done to remedy this problem from the perspective of many African Americans , who maintain low or no regard for mainstream civil-rights organizations . Chavis , therefore , may be in a better position to help rebuild black communities outside the NAACP ' s narrow confines than within . He is not merely a theologian -- that all_important symbol of the African American community -- but a former Amnesty International certified political_prisoner ( for serving four years on a conviction that was later overturned because the evidence had been falsified ) . This baptism by fire is respected by poor blacks who have similar conflagrations in their lives . Among the urban archeological ruins of the Reagan-Bush years , Chavis met with black unemployed gang members , young up-from-poverty college kids , idealistic multiculturalists , socialists , spirited Afro-centrists and most controversial of all , working-class supporters of the Nation of Islam . They are the disenfranchised of traditional civil-rights organizations . Most traditional civil-rights practitioners are principled men and women who have contributed mightily to the cause , but can no more relate to the majority of angry and impoverished black youth today than NAACP giant Roy Wilkins could relate to the &quot; black power &quot; generation of the 1960s . Our need to end the joblessness , crime and self-hate that are devouring entire black communities make a tactical coalition of Chavis , Sharpton , Waters , Jackson , Louis Farrakhan and other key grass-roots and community organizers imperative . Strategically speaking , Chavis ' embrace of Farrakhan is no more an endorsement of &quot; Farrakhanism &quot; than network media executives ' embrace of Rush Limbaugh and Patrick Buchanan are endorsements of their insidious bigotry . In fact , Chavis ' philosophy might even be regarded_as an alternative to Farrakhan ' s segregationist demagoguery . Chavis voices the view that poor people of all colors must come_together to achieve economic and political power in our nation , which continues to favor the prerogatives of wealth . What Chavis and Farrakhan share is a willingness to reach_out to the black poor of America . If it is to survive , the NAACP , no matter who leads it , must do the same .</TEXT>
