   <HEADLINE> COLORADO HEIGHTS HIT BY WAVE OF POPULATION ; ROCKIES : LAND IS EXPENSIVE , SALARIES ARE LOW . MANY EMPLOYEES HAVE NO HEALTH_INSURANCE AND CANNOT AFFORD DAY_CARE . COUNTY GOVERNMENTS END_UP SUBSIDIZING BOTH , STRAINING THEIR BUDGETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Elegant epitaphs often grace tombstones in old mountain towns , but there are no tombstones here . The land is too expensive in this Rocky Mountain ski resort , and some worry headstones might spoil their view . Neighboring Minturn is the nearest resting place for the dead . Few people can afford to live here , either . That has helped make the celebrated mining town of Leadville , 45 miles away , perhaps the world ' s highest bedroom community , at 10 # 200 feet . Some people believe it ' s symptomatic_of what ' s gone_wrong in Colorado ' s high country , since the mining industry was replaced by tourism . Mining work was dangerous , but the companies paid well and provided health_care and housing . The majority of ski resort employees in Vail and Aspen drive at least 30 miles to find affordable housing . A starter log_cabin 40 miles west of Vail in Gypsum goes_for $ 134 # 000 . At the same time , the median salary in Eagle County , where Vail is located , is $ 1 # 400 a month . Many workers don ' t have health_insurance and cannot afford day_care . County governments end_up subsidizing both , straining their budgets . Five of the counties most heavily affected -- Pitkin , Garfield , Eagle , Lake and Summit , whose combined populations grew 33 % in the last decade -- recently met and formed an alliance to address the problems . Colorado ' s solid economy , second only to Arizona , and perceived quality_of_life are drawing more people than at any time since the first resort boom . The state showed a net gain of 70 # 300 last year , the highest since 1972-73 . The backlash from the boom 20 years ago resulted in Coloradans rejecting a plan to play host to the Winter_Olympics at an undeveloped site 10 miles west of Vail . The backlash didn ' t slow the boom , though . Vail Associates went_ahead with plans to develop Beaver Creek into a major ski resort . Vail became the nation ' s biggest and busiest ski resort . But Vail Associates President Andy Daly said Vail isn ' t the driving force in recent development . &quot; It ' s a social trend all_over the United States , and particularly Los Angeles and New York , &quot; he said . &quot; People are moving to rural_areas for a better quality of life. &quot; The population in Eagle County grew 60 % between 1980 and 1990 . Last year , building permits set a record . In March of this year , the county issued 112 permits , compared with 48 in March , 1993 . Aspen Skiing Co . President Bob Maynard said , &quot; They can stop the growth in the city of Aspen . But it will be wall-to-wall people in Rifle and eventually in Grand Junction. &quot; Grand Junction and virtually Colorado ' s entire Western Slope are reporting an influx of people trying to escape urban_areas . Many are from California , and some tag them the &quot; New Okies. &quot; Once-sleepy towns like Montrose are drawing small companies , whose owners and employees want a safer place for their families . County officials such_as Eagle County Commissioner James E . Johnson Jr . are pushing the ski industry and other companies that benefit from tourism to help pay the social cost . Johnson , who did everything from waiting tables to maid ' s work when he first moved to the area , said skiing draws many to the high country . Mary Ferguson , who is retiring from the Carbondale Town Council just a_few days before her 88th birthday , said , &quot; People are leaving California and other places because they think this is the grandest place in the world . We have skiing , fishing , hunting and low taxes. &quot; Many fear the new arrivals bring their problems with them . Carbondale , a bedroom community of Aspen , reported a 33 % increase in serious crimes last year . Glenwood Springs Police_Chief Rick Hollar is worried about signs of gang activity . &quot; The rat_race is catching_up_with us , &quot; Johnson said . The five-county alliance said the ski bums who once ran the lifts and cleaned the rooms are now being replaced by working families whose salaries do not match the high cost_of_living . In 1992 , 45 % of the births reported in the five counties were to low-income families . It ' s no surprise that the counties turn_to the big ski companies for help . The ski companies say they already pay more and offer better benefits than most other businesses in the area . The Vail and Aspen companies subsidize transportation , day_care and housing . The companies offer health_care to employees who want to enroll . When the five counties announced their alliance , Vail Associates was quick to offer to discuss ways it could help . Daly said the ski industry and associated businesses must &quot; realize that in the long term this is going_to come_back and bite us all. &quot; Eugene Lorig , an Eagle lawyer and 33-year resident , said growth itself is the main problem . &quot; The county is going_to be_full of trailer homes , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s politically unacceptable to be against growth. &quot; A native of Telluride , another mountain town trying to control growth , Lorig said , &quot; I liked it a lot better when I could take a gun and go_out and not see anybody all day. &quot; Johnson said county officials and others can try to manage growth and persuade developers that building near already established centers will be cheaper and better for the environment . &quot; Unfortunately , the big money dictates where it wants to build , &quot; he said . &quot; If you ' ve got enough money and want to live underground , you can do_it and still have the sun rise for you. &quot; Johnson said too_much development will destroy what people come here for . &quot; The Lincoln Memorial has a lot of people visit it . But they can ' t live there , &quot; he said . Ironically , Aspen , Vail , Snowmass and Beaver Creek are a bit like one of those monuments . When the season is over , they empty out .</TEXT>
