   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187 ; KEMP DEFENDS CRITICISM BEFORE HOSTILE AUDIENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Republican Cabinet Secretary Jack F . Kemp faced an unenthusiastic and sometimes angry audience at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace on Wednesday as he defended his condemnation of Proposition 187 , the illegal immigration reform measure on the Nov . 8 state ballot . In his first public discussion of his opposition to the initiative , Kemp told the audience that he could not , in good conscience , support a measure that would &quot; turn teachers and nurses into agents of the INS. &quot; Plunging into a controversial debate that puts him at_odds with the state Republican_Party -- and , according to recent public_opinion_polls , a majority of the state ' s voters -- Kemp said the measure feeds an anti-immigrant movement that the GOP should oppose . &quot; I was so bothered in my conscience ( about the initiative ) that I could not , in good conscience , support it , even though I know it will probably pass , &quot; said Kemp , who is considered a possible presidential candidate in 1996 . &quot; Vote for ( Proposition 187 ) . Go_ahead and vote for it , &quot; Kemp told an Anaheim apartment owner who blamed the crime_rate on illegal immigrants . &quot; I don ' t blame you at all . . . . Send a signal ( to Washington ) . But don ' t ask me to defend something that ' s fundamentally flawed . . . . I am speaking from the heart. &quot; The former Housing and Urban Development secretary also told the audience not to &quot; scapegoat the problems of California on immigrants because they are not the source of the problem . The source of the problem is the overtaxation , the overregulation , the stupid defense cuts from Washington , D.C. &quot; Kemp , who was invited to the Nixon library to discuss 1996 presidential campaign issues , was grilled by the audience after it was reported that Kemp and William J . Bennett , another former Republican Cabinet secretary , had prepared a statement strongly opposing the anti-immigration initiative . In the policy statement , which was released Wednesday , Kemp and Bennett said that although they oppose illegal immigration and welfare benefits for illegal immigrants , they believe Proposition 187 is unconstitutional and may &quot; contribute to a nativist , anti-immigrant climate. &quot; Instead , they called_for more effective border control , reform of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a crackdown on fraudulent immigration documents while opposing national identification cards . The release of the policy statement coincided with Kemp ' s planned speech in Orange County -- the birthplace of Proposition 187 -- and on the same day that former President George_Bush attended a political fund-raiser for Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) . Bush did not comment on the measure . Dornan -- despite his support for it -- expressed his own reservations and said of Kemp and Bennett : &quot; I absolutely respect their opinions. &quot; Dornan conceded that the initiative is flawed and may have an adverse effect on schoolchildren . The initiative would require school administrators to report children or the parents of children who are suspected of being illegal immigrants . Outside the restaurant where Bush and Dornan appeared , Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) issued a stinging rebuke of Kemp . &quot; His act of stupidity has knocked him right out of the presidential race , &quot; Rohrabacher told reporters . &quot; If he disagreed_with it , he should have kept his mouth shut . . . . Jack Kemp wants to be loved . The man is using his heart , but that ' s not the organ of the body meant for thinking. &quot; Kemp has campaigned for Gov . Pete Wilson and other GOP candidates on the statewide ballot , a point not lost on a man who stood_up after Kemp ' s speech to challenge Kemp ' s immigration statement . &quot; Why didn ' t you just be_quiet ? &quot; the audience member asked , prompting laughter from the audience . &quot; All you did was boost ( Democratic gubernatorial candidate ) Kathleen Brown and possibly wound your good friend , Pete Wilson. &quot; &quot; Pete Wilson is not going_to lose the election because of Jack Kemp , &quot; the former Cabinet secretary said , emphasizing his belief that Wilson will win the election . Times staff writer Martin Miller contributed to this report .</TEXT>
