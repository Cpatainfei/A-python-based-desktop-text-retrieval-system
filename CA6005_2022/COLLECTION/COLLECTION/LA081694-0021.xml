   <HEADLINE> THE ITALIAN GRAND PRIX TO STAY -- TREES AND ALL ; MOTOR RACING : FORMULA ONE LEADERS REINSTATE EVENT AFTER SAFETY MEASURES ARE TAKEN AT MONZA TRACK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Italian Grand Prix is back on . Three days after canceling the race , Formula One ' s governing body on Monday said it was reinstating the Sept . 11 event following agreement on new safety measures at the Monza circuit . The Federation International de L ' Automobile ( FIA ) said it had approved a proposal for changes to the second Lesmo Corner . &quot; This solution , which changes the shape of the second Lesmo and reduces its speed , is acceptable to the FIA on the basis that it is for 1994 only , &quot; FIA said in a statement . &quot; As a result , the 1994 Italian Grand Prix has been reinstated on the calendar of the 1994 FIA Formula One Championship. &quot; The grandstand at the second corner will be removed and replaced with a gravel run-off area and new crash barriers , FIA spokesman Martin Whitaker said . The angle of the corner will be made more acute , cutting speeds from approximately 161 m.p.h. to 105 m.p.h. , Whitaker said . Monza organizers had suggested putting chicanes between the two Lesmo Corners , but that was ruled_out by FIA . No change will be made to the first corner . FIA had scrapped the race last Friday after local officials refused to make circuit changes that would have required cutting_down 123 trees . The demand to cut the centuries-old trees in the Monza public park had outraged environmentalists , and the city ' s superintendent for environmental and architectural affairs , Lucia Gremmo , vetoed the felling of the trees last Wednesday . Under Monday ' s agreement , no trees will be cut_down . &quot; It was either the trees that went or the grandstand , &quot; Whitaker said . FIA president Max Mosley agreed to the new changes -- proposed by Monza organizers , FIA experts and drivers ' representative Gerhard Berger -- following talks with Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi . &quot; My government and I are very attached to the Italian Grand Prix and the Monza circuit , &quot; Berlusconi told reporters Sunday . &quot; We have done everything in our power to make the race go_ahead Sept . 11. &quot; RAI state TV reported the &quot; great satisfaction &quot; of Cabinet secretary Gianni Letta , who , on behalf of Berlusconi , had met with Mosley on Saturday to press the government ' s campaign that the race be run . FIA stressed the changes are short-term only and it will be actively seeking a long-term solution for the circuit for 1995 and beyond . Safety concerns in Formula One have been heightened since the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at San Marino Grand Prix in May .</TEXT>
