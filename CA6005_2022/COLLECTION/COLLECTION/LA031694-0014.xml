   <HEADLINE> GENETIC EXPLANATIONS : A TWO-EDGED SWORD ; IS OUR SEXUAL AND BEHAVIORAL FATE IN OUR GENES ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seldom has science been so wrong , and so misused , as when it has come_to fathoming the biological basis of human behavior . Genetics spawned the misguided eugenics movement early this century in America and Europe . Thousands of the &quot; feeble-minded &quot; were sterilized under U.S. law , mostly in California . The practice ultimately was abandoned , but not before Germany copied the California law in its program to eliminate &quot; defective &quot; genes , part of the grotesque Nazi ethic that would underlie the effort to exterminate Jews , Gypsies and others . More recently , scientists erroneously linked violent antisocial behavior among men to an abnormal extra Y_chromosome . Many men with the chromosome indeed were in jail , but actually the condition correlated with mild retardation , not criminality per se . SCIENCE IN LAW : Now the powerful tools of modern biology have added a complex wrinkle to the heated public_debate over gay rights . Two years ago , Simon LeVay , a neurobiologist then at the Salk Institute , discovered that a part of the hypothalamus was much smaller in the brains of gay_men than heterosexual ones . And last year , Dean H . Hamer of the National Cancer Institute examined the chromosomes of 40 pairs of brothers who were gay and found that far more_than a chance percentage of them had identical snippets of genes inherited from their mothers on their X_chromosome ; this suggested that male homosexuality is rooted , at least partly , in genes . These findings are hard to interpret and remain to be confirmed , and they have been attacked from some quarters because LeVay and Hamer are openly gay . However , evidence accrues that homosexuality is immutable , not a personal choice . If so , that could bolster the argument that homosexuals should enjoy the legal protections that forbid discrimination based on race or gender . On the other hand , this research could also be used to try to &quot; cure &quot; homosexuality , to screen_out homosexuals from the military or insurance coverage , to abort fetuses carrying a &quot; gay gene. &quot; Hamer argues that sexual orientation is unlikely to be inherited like eye color , that it probably is caused by a intricate mix of genetic and environmental factors . Human sexuality is not an either-or matter , given the incidence of bisexuality . Some scientists say that to prevent public misunderstanding , such research should not be published until fully confirmed . That is an issue that will sharpen as the federal Human Genome Project , which is attempting to chart the entire human genetic map , uncovers the genetic underpinnings of thousands of traits and disorders , opening the possibility of curing many inherited diseases . Research results should not be withheld . But in absorbing this data it must be kept_in mind that the mechanisms of human inheritance invariably have turned_out to be far more complicated than originally imagined . Some ask , for example , why homosexuality is so widespread in the human and animal realms even though homosexuals seldom reproduce , and they suggest that the genetic basis of homosexuality may be linked to other traits , some highly desirable , such_as creativity . Would you have aborted the fetuses that grew_into Michelangelo or Tchaikovsky ? MORALITY IN LAW : Whatever the basis of homosexuality , it is foolish to think that good science will abolish homophobia . Skin_color and gender obviously are governed by genetics but that has not wiped_out racism and sexism . Gay rights activists skate on thin ice when they resort_to science . Wise advice comes from Daniel J . Kevles , a historian at Caltech who argues that claims to social or legal_rights should be based on morality and principle rather than inconclusive biology . As science peels away layer after layer of the biology that supports human behavior and expression , we should remember how science has been abused out of evil or ignorance .</TEXT>
