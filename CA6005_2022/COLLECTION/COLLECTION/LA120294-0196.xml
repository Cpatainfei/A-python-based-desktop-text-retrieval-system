   <TEXT> In 1980 , a year after the overthrow of the shah , Iran ' s &quot; construction jihad &quot; swept_through this farming hamlet deep in the foothills of the spiny Elburz Mountains , bringing modernity in the form of electricity , running water , a public bath and a nearby school . With a corps of engineers and laborers , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ' s revolution had arrived . &quot; This was a lot more_than we ever got from the shah , &quot; said Mohammed Hussein Miveh , the 91-year-old village patriarch , as he sat cross-legged on the floor of his nephew ' s mud-brick and log-roof home . Along the wall were a stainless_steel sink and two battered Westinghouse refrigerators , one of them pink . But 14 years later , the small army of workers hasn ' t been back . And the wheat , potato and walnut farmers of Kordehnavard -- like many of the mostazafin , or &quot; downtrodden , &quot; in whose name Iran ' s 1979 revolution was carried_out -- are growing angry . &quot; We have no phones , no clinic and no roads , &quot; said Reza Miveh , the patriarch ' s nephew . &quot; And everything ' s so expensive . Who can afford sugar anymore or cooking_oil ? The government should be doing much more . Sometimes we wonder whether it ' s forgotten us. &quot; The Islamic Republic of Iran , a modern theocracy , has reached a crisis point . Many of its most ardent backers believe the revolution has left them behind . Some feel it has already begun to collapse . &quot; The nation is in poverty and the country is_on the verge of an explosion , &quot; wrote a former general , Azizollah Amir Rahimi , in a letter circulated in Tehran . For all_the controversy over the religious fervor that animated Iran ' s Islamic revolution , the force that is most threatening the regime is not ideology but economics . The mostazafin are not the only ones who have soured . Two other groups vital to the regime ' s survival -- the young and the middle_class -- are increasingly dissatisfied . With about 70 % of Iran ' s population younger than 25 and roughly half younger than 15 , the country ' s youth -- most of whom don ' t remember the monarchy as a basis of comparison -- will be particularly important . Meheri Fathi , 23 , is one of a virtual suburb of young people in south Tehran who aren ' t happy . &quot; I want this baby so badly , &quot; she said as she rolled her hand_over a fully swollen abdomen . &quot; But we don ' t know where we ' re going to find the 300 # 000 rials ( $ 111 ) to have it or the money to raise it . &quot; I should be happy , but instead I ' m sad and scared. &quot; Fathi and her husband , who earns $ 55 a month as a textile worker , live_in a maze of crude single-room cement hovels at the foot of a power pylon -- into which they are illegally tapped for electricity . With the near-doubling of Iran ' s population since the revolution -- from 34 million to 62 million -- housing has become critically short for young people . Increasingly they are postponing marriage because they can find nowhere to live . The shanties built during the shah ' s era along the desert fringe of Tehran now sell for up_to $ 1 # 100 -- nearly two years ' pay_for Fathi ' s husband -- and the government recently threatened to pull_down these eyesore suburbs without offering alternatives . A similar move last year in the holy_city of Mashhad triggered riots . Unemployment among the young , ages 15 to 24 , is also at least double the national average . The older middle_class hasn ' t fared much better , thanks to skyrocketing prices . Many standard household items are beyond easy reach of the typical family , and cars are often out_of_the_question . &quot; For the first time in my life , I feel really poor , &quot; said a U.S.-educated political_scientist who can ' t afford new tires for his boxy , decade-old , Iranian-made Paykan . The challenge facing Iran ' s Islamic revolution is ultimately the same one that finally forced the failure of the Soviet_Union ' s Communist revolution . Despite its oil , Tehran is_on a downward economic spiral . &quot; The regime is still closer to people than either the two Pahlavi kings were , but a lot of stomachs aren ' t full , &quot; said a Tehran businessman , referring to Iran ' s last dynasty . &quot; So the grumbling is pervasive. &quot; And there ' s no relief in_sight . Indeed , because its oil_industry hasn ' t been modernized , Iran faces the prospect within the next two to five years of declining production , according to Western diplomats and economists in Tehran . Income from foreign sales is further crimped by the burgeoning population ' s domestic consumption , now growing by 3 % to 5 % annually . With a daily quota of 3.6 million barrels , Iran is now OPEC ' s second-largest producer . But if it doesn ' t act soon , Iran could become a net oil importer in 25 years . &quot; Although it seems an unlikely scenario , it does reflect the depth of problems Iran now faces , &quot; a European envoy said . As its foreign debt soars above $ 33 billion -- produced largely by a ravenous wave of consumer imports after the draining eight-year war with Iraq that ended in 1988 -- the mullahcracy is having to decide between the people who brought it to power and the foreign lenders who have kept it afloat . &quot; The crunch point is coming , &quot; predicted a Western economist in Tehran . &quot; The government either meets internal demand for imports or its foreign debt commitment . It can no longer do both . And either way , trouble lies ahead. &quot; So far , policy has flip-flopped . Beginning last year , the regime restructured its foreign debt when it was unable to meet payment schedules . While that bought_time , the debt will also now eat_up as much as one-third of Iran ' s foreign_exchange revenues , in turn limiting its ability to import . Tehran also cut_back on costly subsidies for basic commodities -- from meat to electricity , sugar to fuel -- originated years ago to aid the mostazafin . Subsidies now cost up_to $ 12 billion a year , about what Iran earns in oil exports , which are down to barely one-third of the revenues earned in the late 1970s . As a result , consumers this year faced soaring prices and scarcities , while industrial production also declined as imported spare_parts and raw_materials grew hard to find . Production at a major television manufacturer is down to 30 % of capacity ; dozens of businesses have closed shops and moved_into private homes . Inflation reached at least 40 % a year , with some items -- sugar , butter , taxis -- hitting 200 % , local and foreign economists say . Fury over hardships became rampant in the media , in parliamentary debates , in public discussions -- even in casual conversations with total strangers . &quot; What do you think ? &quot; a telephone information operator asked a caller . &quot; Should I go_to Detroit ? My brother ' s there . I ' ve never been out of Iran , and I hear it ' s very dangerous there . But I can ' t afford it here anymore. &quot; In October , Tehran reversed course , restoring subsidies for sugar and several other goods and imposing price_controls . And the regime , launching an anti-profiteering campaign , unleashed vigilantes to search for hoarders and special courts to try them . Iran ' s colorful press has since been_full of headlines chronicling the scandalous behavior of merchants such_as one in Shiraz who stashed 56 sacks of sugar , 800 packs of tea and 224 tires -- a crime eliciting an $ 8 # 000 fine . But the restored subsidies and price_controls only defer the problem and magnify the long-term cost . &quot; The subsidies are incredibly costly , &quot; conceded Ali Naqi Khamooshi , president of Iran ' s Chamber_of_Commerce , Industry and Mines and a member_of_Parliament . &quot; But because of fluctuating oil prices , we haven ' t earned what we expected , which hurt our ability to import . So we couldn ' t prevent a sharp rise in prices , which brought us a real social problem. &quot; Up to 40 % of Iran ' s population , he said , is now considered low income -- below the poverty_line or barely above it . And the latest state intervention won ' t significantly lighten the average family ' s burden . There is no systematic way to compare conditions now with those that prevailed under the shah , whose regime kept no accurate economic data . But here is a straw in the wind : Many Iranians , even in senior positions , have resorted_to second and third jobs to make ends meet . Several Cabinet_ministers also head groups such_as sports federations , while members_of_Parliament usually have outside jobs as teachers , in business or at mosques . Parliament this year banned government workers from holding second jobs . Even the Islamic Republic ' s successes have become as much burden as benefit . The number of students in primary_schools has almost tripled from 7 million to 19 million since the revolution , and university_students have skyrocketed from fewer than 100 # 000 to more_than 1 million . &quot; We ' re proud_of the numbers . But it also means education uses more_than a quarter of our national budget -- much more_than defense , &quot; Khamooshi said . With vast shortages of classrooms and teachers , many schools are_on double or triple shifts . Since private_schools are banned , the ever-ingenious Iranians launched alternative &quot; nonprofit &quot; schools in 1992 . They now account_for at least 10 % of primary education , and the government is encouraging their growth . Social conditions are visibly deteriorating : a middle-aged violinist , his case open on the pavement for donations , plays elegantly in the midst of heavy pedestrian_traffic on Tehran ' s tree-lined Vali Asr Avenue ; an older_man sleeps on the sidewalk across the way . Underpaid police have taken_to knocking_on doors of wealthy north Tehran ' s villas and bungalows to ask_for &quot; tips , &quot; which residents say they ' re afraid not to pay . Crowded , noisy and horribly polluted as Tehran is , it became one of the world ' s safer cities after the revolutionary government imposed the strict Islamic penal_code . Crime is now back . Even guarded diplomats are vulnerable . A Scandinavian envoy and his wife have been repeatedly robbed . The wife of a Hungarian diplomat was murdered this fall during a robbery ; her husband remains in a coma . For all Iran ' s problems , vast numbers are still living better than most of their Third_World counterparts , diplomats say . The shops and boutiques on Vali Asr Avenue are still filled with the fancy_dresses and high heels Iranian women wear under their chadors . The Qodssupermarket has stocked up_on large plastic bottles of Wesson Oil . Many Iranians seem to recognize that the piper may soon have to be paid , although , at least in this farming village , the citizenry is glad to be rid_of the shah . &quot; The only thing the Pahlavis gave us were our names , &quot; patriarch Mohammed Hussein Miveh said with a wry smile . Like most Iranians , he got his last_name by royal edict as part of the monarchy ' s modernization campaign . His was selected by officials who arrived just as local orchards bloomed ; Miveh means fruit . The situation here is probably typical . &quot; Most people are probably better_off in some way , &quot; reflected a well-known Iranian journalist . &quot; Very little is exclusive anymore . The mostazafin share the benefits of society . They have access to education . They have appliances . They expect to travel , if only to a religious shrine . &quot; The basic problem for this revolution , like any revolution , is that it created enormous expectations -- and an insatiable appetite for things it never could have provided . In that sense , it was always doomed to be disappointing . But no one thought it would get quite this bad . And I think most people realize it ' s probably going_to get worse. &quot;</TEXT>
