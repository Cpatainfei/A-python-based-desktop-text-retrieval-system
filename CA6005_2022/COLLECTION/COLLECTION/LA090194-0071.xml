   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA ; GIVE_UP TRYING TO BE PYGMALION ; BOTH U.S. BUSINESS AND REFORMERS NEED TO REASSESS A NATION UNWILLING AND UNABLE TO FIT OUR MOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown may believe his trip to China has been a triumph in salesmanship that will net billions for American business . But it has surely left China ' s dictators smiling with the secure feeling that they can make more deals with &quot; business first &quot; Americans , tighten the screws on dissidents at_home with impunity and go_on the offensive against any Americans who insist that they respect the rights of_their_own citizens . Too many American views of China are colored by wishful_thinking and greed . It is a result of a cultural habit of thinking ; a combination of a missionary zeal to convert and a capitalist zeal to profit . Many Americans like the notion that they can somehow pressure China to &quot; be like us. &quot; We can ' t . As with so_much , in dealing with China , there is a great gulf between being well-meaning and doing_good . The Chinese know perfectly well who they are . There is no groundswell among them to be democratic in the mold of America . Experience with democracy is something they have never had . They don ' t know the taste of the rule_of_law , or fair play . Their system has not allowed that . There is a groundswell among China ' s citizens to demand accountability from their government . But their government is aloof to these demands . China ' s Communist_Party dictators form a thin class at the top of society . They are the lords , the feudal families who control most of the power and wealth . They also control most of the guns . This ruling_class is changing the currency of its power from private perks and privileges to money . They are cashing_in . Some of their money goes_into investments outside China , like homes_in California , where they know it will be safe , and where they may someday flee . Much of the money is used to lubricate an internal system of corruption . No foreign investors will be immune from the siphoning effects of Chinese business . Some of the spoils of the new money game go_to the branches of the vast security apparatus -- from riot police to border police to customs agents to municipal police to secret_police . These police are the agents of repression and torture . These people run drugs and guns and contraband and brothels . They work fist in glove with emerging criminal syndicates . So the hooligans at the bottom of society , the ex-cons and street-hustlers , flourish along with their patrons -- the hard-core communists and their families . Caught in the vise of greed and plunder and official caprice is the vast majority of China ' s 1.2 billion people . Most are very poor and barely educated . They are accustomed to government repression and persecution , to struggling against their betters , to treachery and betrayal . They are also accustomed to working hard and using enterprise and perseverance to survive . Many also are angry at being squeezed . So they rebel . They riot . They go_on strike . They complain . They wait . The most able turn_to business . They make profits on the model of a Michael Milken . The best and the brightest run ahead of regulations and churn money through a system that is governed by insider_trading . But there is little room and little opportunity for most of China ' s farmers and workers to prosper . So the least able remain busy and poor , or just idle . Often they lose their money when they stake it on pursuing new opportunities . Like many of the millions who ride the rails to the big coastal cities only to exhaust their savings and themselves in search of work , finding that too many others got there first . They return home broke , ashamed , dispirited to lives of poverty . Then there are the industrial workers . The communist state remains , but its promise of cradle-to-grave benefits is withering away . Many of those who are laid_off fend_for themselves . They are angry that egalitarian dreams have been taken_away . Some long for the guarantees of the Maoist days . The laid-off woman who invested in_stock and lost her money feels she had been abandoned twice -- once by the fading promises of socialism , again by flickering promise of the market . Those who have jobs often moonlight . For all their problems , the Chinese remain proud and capable . They and their leaders will cobble_together a new nationalism , which Westerners may_not like . Across society , most Chinese are wary of what their propagandists dub &quot; foreign hostile forces. &quot; Despite any photo-ops and embraces between officials and their so-called &quot; old friends &quot; from abroad , official xenophobia remains a cornerstone of China ' s internal governing ideology . The officials will protect their people from foreigners wishing to convert them . They also will protect them from plunder by foreigners . China ' s growth statistics may lull many Americans into imagining that the nation is_on a happy trajectory to riches . But the opposite is true . As China deconstructs from social and economic tensions within , as its arable land shrinks and pollution mounts , as its population increases , the nation may plunge into harsher times . If natural disaster hits or , political infighting turns_to armed conflict , the specter of Rwanda could be reflected in pockets of China . Millions of Chinese are ready to leave in search of economic and political opportunities . So far , few get_out . Americans might best start to think_about China less as a country ripe for profit-taking and political conversion and more as one on the verge of a hemorrhage .</TEXT>
