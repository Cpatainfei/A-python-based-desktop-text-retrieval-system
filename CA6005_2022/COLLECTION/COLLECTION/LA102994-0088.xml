   <HEADLINE> THERE ' S A HITCH ; SLOW-MOVING DIVORCE COMPLICATES WEDDING PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The groom had driven all_the way to Santa Clarita from Kennedy , Tex . Their new home was ready in Provo , Utah . A big wedding_reception was planned here next week . So what could hold_up the plans of Laura Molidor and James Linder to marry in Las Vegas this weekend ? To her surprise and exasperation , Molidor says , she just learned that she is still hitched to a man in Palmdale despite four years of efforts to get an uncontested divorce signed and sealed . Whether slow-moving court bureaucracy or a paperwork problem in Molidor ' s lawyer ' s office is to blame is the subject of dispute . But as late as Friday afternoon , they were still debating whether to go_ahead with the ceremony in Las Vegas -- relying_on assurances from the same lawyer ' s office that , divorce decree or no , there are legal ways that may ensure later that the marriage is legal , not bigamous . &quot; We ' ve changed our minds at least six times in the last few days , &quot; Molidor said . She and Linder were alternately fuming and laughing about the problem . &quot; I always said I would n ' t marry a Mormon unless I could have more_than one husband , &quot; Molidor said in reference_to Linder ' s religious background . &quot; But it might turn_out that way after all , &quot; she joked , acknowledging that she knows that Mormons no longer practice polygamy . Molidor , 30 , said she separated from her first husband four years ago and filed for what she thought was an uncomplicated divorce , with no financial or child custody disputes . After innumerable delays in getting a decree , she found a new lawyer , who assured her the divorce would be final in time for her to remarry in late October . With that , she said , she finalized her wedding plans and told her beau , a 34-year-old businessman , to wrap_up things in Texas and come_out . The couple were frustrated this week , however , when a representative of her attorney informed them that there were delays because the Los Angeles Superior_Court commissioner in San Fernando who was to sign the divorce papers had been_on a month ' s vacation . &quot; If the courts have a backlog , they just ought to do a little overtime , &quot; she said . Linder ruefully noted that his previous wife was granted a divorce from him only three weeks after she filed . But a court clerk said Friday that Molidor ' s petition was not submitted until Sept . 26 , and then was rejected in mid-October because the papers were incorrectly prepared -- a glitch Molidor apparently did not know about . New papers from the attorney were received Oct . 19 . * The attorney , James Reape of Santa Clarita , did not return phone_calls seeking comment Friday . Reape ' s office advised them not to marry , Molidor said -- but offered her an &quot; out &quot; if she does : They could take_a_chance on filing a nunc pro tunc petition after their wedding , saying that there was good_enough reason for them to marry , which could protect the status of the marriage , she said . Regardless of any weekend decision , Molidor said they planned to drive_back Monday to Palmdale , where her current husband still lives with their two children . &quot; I want to take the kids out trick-or-treating on Halloween , &quot; she said . Linder , who is_on good terms with his fiancee ' s still-legal spouse , added : &quot; And if we do go_ahead and get_married in Vegas , we two men will be sitting around watching &quot; Monday Night Football , &quot; talking_about our wife. &quot;</TEXT>
