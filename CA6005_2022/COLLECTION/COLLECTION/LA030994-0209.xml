   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW RAISES THE PROSPECT OF MANY ADDITIONAL TRIALS ; COURTS : DEFENSE_ATTORNEYS ARE ADVISING CLIENTS AGAINST PLEA BARGAINS . JUVENILE PROVISIONS DRAW CRITICISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The day after &quot; three strikes &quot; became law , lawyers advised adult and juvenile defendants to go_to trial , raising the prospect that courts will quickly become jammed . In Alameda County , Dist . Atty . John Meehan said he will not enforce one key provision of the tough new criminal sentencing law . Meehan said he will not count crimes committed by juveniles as &quot; strikes &quot; because he thinks the provision is unconstitutional . Although the full impact of the law targeting repeat felons will not be felt_for years , the earliest ripples of change were being felt Tuesday as_many judges , prosecutors and defense_lawyers studied the law for the first time . Prosecutors and criminal defense_lawyers set_up task_forces and met with judges in an effort to sort_out how they would handle what they assume will be an onslaught of trials and heavy sentences . &quot; I have been studying it all day , &quot; Stanislaus County Dist . Atty . Donald Stahl said . By day ' s end , he had concluded that &quot; it ' s the toughest thing I ' ve seen in 28 years . This is farther reaching certainly than the death penalty. &quot; The new law says criminals who have committed two prior violent or serious felonies -- there are 29 of them , ranging from murder to residential burglary -- and commit any felony on a third offense will face a minimum sentence of 25 years to life . The law also doubles sentences for second convictions on serious or violent felonies . The first defendants to face life sentences under &quot; three strikes &quot; are almost certainly in jail by now , but their identities may_not be known until later in the week . After making an arrest , police must obtain rap sheets detailing a suspect ' s previous crimes , process the case and send it to prosecutors , all_of which takes a day or two . Los Angeles County public_defenders began telling adult defendants that there was little reason to accept plea bargains now if it means that in later life they could be subject_to additional time in prison if convicted of a new felony . Better to test prosecutors ' evidence by taking more cases to trial , they said . &quot; I ' m certain that there are people who have opted against accepting plea bargains , &quot; said Jabe Kahnke , a deputy public_defender in Long_Beach . &quot; It ' s certainly something we discussed this morning before ( the staff_members ) went_to court. &quot; Orange County law_enforcement officials said they spent Tuesday analyzing the full text of the new state law to prepare_for a criminal case that will test the &quot; three strikes you ' re out &quot; guidelines . &quot; We ' re geared_up but nothing ' s in the works , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . John D . Conley . Jennifer L . Keller , a former public_defender now in private practice in Irvine , predicted that the court system will overflow with defendants going_to trial instead of pleading guilty because they don ' t want to spend 25 years in jail for relatively minor felony offenses such_as forgery . &quot; It ' s going_to be a nightmare , &quot; Keller said . In San Francisco , Public_Defender Jeff Brown said : &quot; People are really putting_on the brakes in terms of pleas . People are being hauled aside and given time to reflect on this . The ramifications are a hell of a lot more serious today than it was ( Monday ) . &quot; Brown said he is directing his deputies &quot; to ask_for a jury trial &quot; in juvenile proceedings , rather than a less formal proceeding before a judge -- &quot; and we ' re going to challenge any prior ( conviction ) based on a juvenile adjudication if the conviction was not secured by a jury trial. &quot; Los Angeles public_defenders also were considering making such requests . &quot; If it ' s going_to count as a conviction , it has to be contested , &quot; said Los Angeles County Deputy Public_Defender Nina Law , who handles juvenile cases in Long_Beach . The juvenile_court system is far less formal and is designed to rehabilitate rather than punish . Juvenile convictions are known as &quot; adjudications &quot; and are made without juries and without many of the rules_of_evidence of adult court . When the law was moving through the Legislature , many county prosecutors said that some of its provisions may be unconstitutional . The California District_Attorneys Assn . lobbied against it and tried to persuade Wilson not to sign it . But in an electorate weary and angry over crime , the concept of imprisoning repeat felons for life has gathered huge support . Legislators in Sacramento cast_aside concerns about the measure ' s cost , questions about constitutionality and ambiguity of some of its provisions , and approved the bill by Assemblymen Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) and Jim Costa ( D-Fresno ) without amendment . As it went_into effect this week , most prosecutors said they intended to fully carry_out the new law . Meehan , who objected to the provision regarding juvenile offenders , is a veteran of 34 years as a prosecutor and is stepping_down this year . He is a past president of the district_attorneys association and has often taken stands that run counter to those of strict law-and-order prosecutors . &quot; I personally think there is a cloud_over the juvenile cases ( clause ) , &quot; Meehan said . Other prosecutors interviewed Tuesday say they will attempt to count juvenile crimes as strikes . But Meehan said , &quot; Good_luck trying to prove them. &quot; He noted that records of juvenile proceedings are sealed unless defendants are tried as adults , and most juvenile cases are disposed_of in informal hearings . In the state_attorney general ' s office , a task_force of experts on sentencing and criminal_law embarked_on a full analysis of the new law , formulating the state ' s position on key questions , and how to defend expected legal attacks . &quot; I knew there were going_to be some big , big problems , &quot; said George Williamson , chief_assistant to Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren and a major proponent of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . &quot; We were aware that there were some drafting concerns which were significant . We were also advised by line prosecutors that they perceived some problems. &quot; Williamson said he is anticipating charges by defense_lawyers that all three crimes must be committed after Monday , the day the law went_into effect . But he predicted that the state would prevail on its position : A felon could have been convicted of two serious or violent felonies before Monday , be convicted of a third felony after Monday , and be subject_to a sentence of 25 years to life . There will be other challenges , including objections to the provision that serious or violent felonies committed by a juvenile age 16 or 17 can be counted as strikes , Williamson said . On Tuesday , Kern County Dist . Atty . Ed Jagels was among county prosecutors who set_up a committee of deputies to study its implications . His prosecutors quickly found a potential problem not previously considered . Kern County has three state_prisons . A prisoner who commits virtually any transgression , from assault on another inmate to possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia or a weapon , can be charged with a felony . That felony would count as a third strike for those with two strikes behind them . &quot; There have to be hundreds of these . Anything you do_in the prison is a felony , &quot; Jagels said .
