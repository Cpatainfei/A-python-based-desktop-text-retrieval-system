   <HEADLINE> ALONG CAME A SPIDER ; ROBOTICS : COMPUTER-DRIVEN BOX ON WIRES , BUILT BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS , WILL TWIST KNOBS , READ GAUGES ON SPACE SHUTTLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charlotte , a spider-like robot named after the clever arachnid in the book &quot; Charlotte ' s Web , &quot; will soon be scurrying about in the heavens helping space shuttle astronauts do their chores . The robot , about the size of a microwave_oven , will do_work that is_better fitted for an eight-limbed mechanical spider than two-armed astronauts -- things like carrying heavy payloads in shuttle experiments and shooting pictures in space . Charlotte was hatched by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace_engineers in Houston and was performing demonstrations at the company ' s Huntington Beach plant this week . The robot can record experiments and operate knobs , switches and buttons . Next year , the robot will be carried into space on a shuttle that will house SpaceHab , a research lab for biological and material science experiments . Charlotte can be used by a scientist on the ground with a laptop_computer to remotely control_experiments in space . Charlotte is suspended on eight cables that are relatively easy to install and remove . Servomotors reel the cables , allowing Charlotte to maneuver in space much like a spider in its web . McDonnell Douglas named the robot after the clever and reliable spider in &quot; Charlotte ' s Web , &quot; a popular book by E.B. White that was made into children ' s animated film . &quot; Charlotte was always reliable in the book and had an answer whenever Wilbur ( a pig ) had a problem , &quot; said Julia MacInnes , spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas . Although developed for extraterrestrial work , Charlotte could be used for light construction duty , such_as placing windows on high-rise buildings , entertainment and &quot; virtual_reality &quot; training on Earth , the company said . So , like in the book ' s ending , Charlotte one day might hatch 100 baby spiders .</TEXT>
