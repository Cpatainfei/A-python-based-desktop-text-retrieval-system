   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; A COMPRESSED LESSON IN MODERN ART</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s a pleasure to see Michael Goldberg ' s 10 paintings from the 1950s at Manny Silverman Gallery . As a group , they present a compressed lesson in Modern Art history . More instructive than many full-dress retrospectives , Goldberg ' s focused exhibition is true_to the risks taken by American abstract painters . This mini-survey offers a lucid , step-by-step demonstration of the artist ' s struggle to take possession of a dynamic , wide-open style . The unevenness of Goldberg ' s paintings clarifies the fresh , experimental nature of Abstract_Expressionism ' s first decade . Large-scale oils that have the tense , physical presence of impacted explosions hang next to smaller works that seem to fizzle_out before capturing the visual urgency they sought . With almost 40 years of hindsight , it ' s not difficult to distinguish the 70-year-old painter ' s knock-outs -- the frenetic &quot; Madame Recamier , &quot; the lyrical &quot; Still_Life with Onion_Rolls &quot; and the foreboding &quot; Casserine Pass &quot; -- from his less stunning works , such_as &quot; House of Medici &quot; and &quot; Snow Walk. &quot; It ' s also easy to see that Goldberg followed no formulas when he painted , instead taking chances and improvising . The two earliest works reveal his attentiveness to European abstraction , particularly Cubist facture and the palette and substantiality of Leger ' s simplified forms . The rest of the paintings swiftly build_in ambition and decisiveness , if not always in strength and resonance . Over the decade , Goldberg moved away from rapid-fire , gestural flourishes indebted to De Kooning ' s fluid brushwork and toward his own signature style , in which composition bears an architectural weight . A vivid green field interrupted by a fractured double-cross embodies the crisp impact of the artist ' s best works . Goldberg ' s rambunctious paintings from the 1950s link his recent mixed-media abstractions ( which include vibrant , eye-popping stripes and star-bursts ) to the original impulses of the New York School . For the last 40 years , he has loaded abstract , visual energy into his pictures , pushing beyond his sources into a lively realm all his own . * Manny Silverman Gallery , 619 N . Almont Dr. , West Hollywood , ( 310 ) 659-8256 , through Dec . 10 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Silence Is Golden : Alan Wayne ' s multi-panel monochromes are some of the slowest paintings being made today . At first glance , there ' s not much to see and even less to look_for . After a bit of time , it becomes clear that his resoundingly silent installation at Newspace is the most beautiful show the gallery has mounted in recent memory . Wayne ' s exceptionally understated paintings intrigue because they eliminate the distance on which contemplation is ordinarily predicated . Standing before any of his single or multi-part oils on canvas invites all_the responses normally associated with attentive gazing . Thoughtful deliberation , careful consideration , quasi-mystical or spiritual musing and the serenity that sometimes accompanies these heightened mental activities are some of the experiences Wayne ' s art gradually and generously elicits . However , when you are looking_at his deep blue , buttery white , intense red and nearly black canvases , it doesn ' t feel_like you are scrutinizing external objects . As Wayne ' s graceful paintings slip out_of_focus and into your memory , your sense of objectivity diminishes . Detached observation and painstaking study slowly give_way to introspective meditation . You find yourself in the middle of a participatory drama that is potentially endless . Wayne juxtaposes nearly identical canvases in groups of two , three or four panels . Since it is impossible to distinguish one rectangle of saturated color from the next , it is impossible to establish any sort of chronological or narrative sequence . As a result , time physically comes_to a halt , drawing viewers into individual face-offs with their perceptions , expectations and prejudices . Wayne ' s adamantly passive paintings don ' t provide any answers , only more focused questions . * Newspace , 5241 Melrose Ave. , ( 213 ) 469-9353 , through Dec . 3 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * A Fastidious Craftsman : Richard Baker ' s odd little still_lifes floating in fragmented landscapes are painted in an academic style that is dry without being lifeless . At Louis Stern Fine_Arts , the young , New York-based artist ' s studies of fruits , tools , rocks , fish and face_masks manage to be charming despite the well-worn territory they trod . Baker lavishes a lot of attention on the surfaces he paints , fleshing out the objects he depicts with palpable textures and occasionally juicy details . To his credit , his fastidious craftsmanship never gets fussy or precious . On the contrary , a stubborn sense of mere approximation or perfunctory adequacy infuses his well-worked pictures with a toughness that borders_on indifference . Baker ' s backgrounds are rendered with an equally perverse insistence on inconsistency . Their jarring shifts in perspective are so awkward , programmatic and studied that they appear to be the ham-fisted exercises of an unimaginative student . Nevertheless , the disjunctive backdrops in Baker ' s paintings cannot be described as standard attempts to exploit figure-ground ambiguity . His lumpy paintings save themselves from such cliched conventions by maintaining a deeply ambivalent relationship between haplessness and inevitability . In these endearing pictures , details seem to fall_into_place despite the artist ' s best intentions . * Louis Stern Fine_Arts , 9002 Melrose Ave. , West Hollywood , ( 310 ) 276-0147 , through Dec . 3 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * A Spin on Surrealism : Bay Area artist Jay DeFeo ( 1929-1989 ) puts a delicate spin on Surrealism in her drawings and photo-collages from the 1970s . Best known for &quot; The Rose , &quot; a 2 # 300-pound painting that devoured seven years of her life ( plus the remnants of her jewelry-making business and an entire wall of her studio ) , DeFeo ' s small works_on paper at Kohn Turner Gallery reveal a more intimate , subtle and sexy side of her art . Her fine drawings depict partial views of tripods , swim goggles , tape-dispensers and other gracefully curved forms that seem simultaneously organic and mechanical . The objects fade near the edges of the paper , suggesting that these anthropomorphic forms belong not to the world of concrete substances but to an intangible realm of fragile , crystalline memories . DeFeo ' s collages also eschew real-world specificity in favor of dreamy associations . The slight dramas of her often abstract pictures evoke moods , textures and drifting reveries , rather than eliciting direct messages or describing shocking scenarios . Unlike her one-ton magnum_opus and much of the flamboyant Beat poetry of her generation , DeFeo ' s works_on paper enter consciousness on tiptoe . They reverberate like musical jingles you can ' t get_out of your head , but never know why they got stuck there . * Kohn / Turner Gallery , 9006 Melrose Ave. , West Hollywood , ( 310 ) 271-4453 , through Dec . 17 . Closed Sundays and Mondays .</TEXT>
