   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; FACED WITH A TV WAR , EUROPEANS SWITCH OFF ; BOSNIA : BLOODY IMAGES DISTURB THE CONTINENT ' S PSYCHE MUCH AS VIETNAM ERODED AMERICA ' S , BUT PUBLIC REMAINS SILENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most Europeans , the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a remote conflict that starts and ends with the evening news . The images of hunger , death and destruction beamed from Sarajevo and the many faceless smaller_towns elsewhere in Bosnia begin their nightly rounds with the early evening television_news in Germany and roll through millions of living_rooms on the Continent before the night ' s final summaries conclude in Britain several hours later . It is an unpleasant but shared experience -- Europe ' s first television war . In some ways , the war in Bosnia has parallels with America ' s first television war nearly a generation ago : Vietnam . Much as Americans once did , Europeans each evening confront a relentless , deeply disturbing conflict whose very ugliness flies in the face of the values they profess . Much as the Vietnam quagmire fed American self-doubt and eroded national self-confidence , so has the war in Bosnia had a corrosive , demoralizing impact here , mocking the dreams of those who yearn for a united Europe and undercutting their influence . Along with the deepest recession since the 1930s and other worrisome uncertainties in the former Communist East , the Bosnian war is a key contributor to the climate of pessimism and uncertainty that hangs over much of the Old_World today . &quot; One has to question the state of Europe today if 350 million Europeans can ' t save the 350 # 000 inhabitants of Sarajevo , &quot; France ' s former minister of humanitarian affairs , Bernard Kouchner , wrote in a commentary in the European weekly newspaper . Summed_up Peter Ludlow , director of the Center for European Policy Studies here : &quot; It ' s thoroughly demoralizing in just about every way. &quot; In the struggle between those pushing for greater economic and political integration and those working to reignite the long-dormant flames of nationalist hatred -- a struggle that many see as the great drama of post-Cold War Europe -- the war in Bosnia stands as a symbol of the power and destructiveness of nationalistic passion . Despite all this , however , the European public seems eerily silent . The electronic_images from Bosnia have yet to shake any European government to its foundations . Nor have they ignited violent anti-war clashes such_as those that chased the Democrats from the White_House and threatened to tear the United States apart in the late 1960s . Indeed , the biggest split of public_opinion in Europe about the Bosnian war is whether to become involved at all . Even the leaders of Western Europe ' s potentially powerful peace movement , who mobilized millions to oppose the deployment of U.S. nuclear missiles during the 1980s and marched again in early 1991 to protest the Western attack against Iraq , have all but ignored the first major war on their continent since 1945 . &quot; The sense of non-involvement is most worrying , &quot; Oxford_University historian Williams Wallace said . &quot; Sure , there are small groups sending food and clothing , but that ' s really it . I get no sense of public urgency. &quot; Wallace noted that this mood of non-involvement exists despite the reality that before the breakup of Yugoslavia , Adriatic coastal resorts in the region were among the most popular of all vacation_spots for sun-starved northern Europeans . &quot; Suddenly , everyone switched_off , &quot; he said . Of all European governments , only France has so far openly pushed for military_action to back_up the futile diplomatic threats to end the war . In part , the public apathy reflects the inability of many Europeans to relate to a conflict that , although less than an hour ' s flying time from Vienna or Rome , has little impact on their daily lives . Another factor is that -- unlike what happened in Vietnam -- very few &quot; outsiders &quot; are dying in Bosnia . It is true that France and Britain are the two largest contributors of manpower to U.N. peacekeeping forces in the region . But the 77 peacekeepers killed in the former Yugoslav federation make_up a number dwarfed by the casualties that helped motivate opposition to the Vietnam_War , which claimed more_than 50 # 000 U.S. lives . Another important factor is that Germany , Western Europe ' s largest and richest power , a country that has taken_in more_than 200 # 000 refugees from the war region and where public sentiment runs high &quot; to do something , &quot; remains paralyzed by its history and its own constitution . Privately , German leaders admit that even if their country ' s constitution were amended to permit the country to engage in military_action outside the Western Alliance area , the lingering memory in the Balkans of Nazi-era atrocities there would make_it impossible for Bonn to deploy forces there . Robbed of the Franco-German partnership so crucial for mobilizing multinational action , the 12-nation European Union has instead been limited mainly to issuing empty diplomatic threats and offering a political settlement that it cannot impose on its own . Among those who believe that Europe should act , the frustration is considerable . They question the ultimate fate of a_people that fails to defend its most basic values . &quot; After everything we ' ve heard , what still has to happen for us to finally decide no longer to just watch ? &quot; an anguished young German legislator , Stefan Schwarz , asked_in December , 1992 , after reports of especially gruesome Serbian atrocities . &quot; How , I ' d like to ask , can one just watch when people are slaughtered ? &quot; About 15 months and countless further shocks later , his questions remain unanswered . In the wake of the Feb . 5 artillery attack on a Sarajevo marketplace that claimed 68 lives , the Belgian daily Le Soir echoed , &quot; How much longer is this horror going_to go_on ? &quot; There is already evidence that the war ' s fallout is likely to influence Europe ' s future . It has shaken public confidence in the idea of a collective European foreign and security policy and has shown that such action remains more an ideal than a reality , despite the high-profile commitments to political union made by the 12 European Union nations in their 1991 Maastricht Treaty . The confused , often conflicting responses from European capitals have also made_it clear that the region ' s major_powers are still incapable of acting without U.S. involvement in a major crisis . Because of this , it is the advocates of European integration and multinational bodies such_as the European Union , rather than national governments , that have lost credibility . &quot; It is Europe , not national governments , that have failed , &quot; Wallace said . Francois Heisbourg , former director of the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies and now a senior figure in French industry , argued in an interview that the European Union ' s inaction in Bosnia was at least partly responsible_for the unexpectedly close French ratification of the Maastricht Treaty . And Ludlow noted : &quot; The siege ( of Sarajevo ) began right in the middle of the post-Maastricht euphoria . The commitment to the idea of a common foreign and security ( policy ) was too new , too fresh . The timing was unfortunate. &quot; Another alarming message of the Bosnian conflict , however , comes_with the spectacular disintegration of multicultural life in Sarajevo , a city once held_up as a model of social integration . Events in the Bosnian capital not only demonstrate the power of nationalistic emotions but raise unsettling questions about the fate of ethnic tensions elsewhere in Europe . &quot; What will the reaction be when old conflicts between Poles and Lithuanians or Hungarians and Slovaks erupt again ? &quot; asked Joachim Boelke , a commentator for the German national daily Die Welt . &quot; Almost as an aside , the West has given_away one of the basic_principles that will determine the future. &quot; Despite all this , some insist that the legacy of the war is not all negative for Europe . Ludlow said the Balkans war had opened the door to a possible new trilateral partnership for maintaining order in 21st-Century Europe . &quot; The way things are playing out , a new relationship is emerging between the United States , the EU and Russia , &quot; he said . &quot; They are suddenly being forced to collaborate on very different terms. &quot; Researcher Isabelle Maelcamp of The Times ' Brussels Bureau contributed to this article .</TEXT>
