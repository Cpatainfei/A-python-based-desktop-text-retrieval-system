   <HEADLINE> ON CALIFORNIA : HERE ' S YOUR HAT , WHAT ' S YOUR HURRY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taco Bell is run from one of those sparkling glass structures that sprouted in clusters in South Orange County during the last boom . Reflected in the office tower ' s green tinted walls are blue_skies -- and the tinted walls of neighboring office towers . Everything about the place is clean , well-maintained and suggestive_of wealth : At the corner bus_stop , the kiosk billboard advertises a Mercedes-Benz dealership . The 1 # 000 or so people who work inside this building are the wizards of marketing and menu who built Glen Bell ' s taco stand_in Downey into , to quote from a corporate press_release , &quot; the nation ' s leading Mexican-style , quick-service restaurant chain. &quot; They are the folks who devised methods to reduce , quoting the company material again , &quot; order processing_times to under 30 seconds &quot; and developed the &quot; K-minus &quot; concept , transforming kitchens &quot; into assembly_line areas utilizing prepared ingredients. &quot; Yum . These are the big idea people , the bean trust . &quot; What is the value of a big idea ? &quot; Taco Bell CEO John E . Martin mused recently for the benefit of a Times reporter . &quot; In our case , a big idea could add $ 600 to $ 700 million in sales in one year to our business. &quot; The context in which Martin pondered this question is interesting . In the same interview , Martin spoke_to Ann Conway of The Times of this &quot; decision I have to make . . . a tough decision. &quot; In simplest terms , the decision is whether to up and move Taco Bell ' s corporate headquarters , the bean trust , to something called Plano , Tex . His &quot; druthers , &quot; Martin went_on , &quot; would be to stay in California. &quot; But . . . . * In this game Martin is playing , there always is a but . Taco Bell has become fabulously successful here , but Texas is offering so many incentives . California is a great place to recruit big idea people , but Texas is talking_about cheap land and multimillion-dollar tax_breaks . Loyalty is fine , but bidness is bidness . In the past few weeks , Taco Bell executives have met with a succession of California politicians and business_leaders . Pete Wilson is_on the case . So is Willie Brown . Just what California can deliver for Taco Bell is not clear . There is this problem of a looming budget_deficit . And it seems the recession hasn ' t gone_away yet . And also there was this big earthquake in Los Angeles -- although it did not seem to inflict any damage to the glass towers down here . Taco Bell executives won ' t say what exactly they want . They have circled the public relations wagons , shooing reporters out of the building , recycling old press statements that promise a decision soon but , beyond that , say nothing . It is said that some California officials who made the pilgrimage here were required to promise in writing that they would not disclose any details of the discussions . &quot; There are all sorts of different things they are asking_for , &quot; said one official familiar_with the discussions . Like tax_breaks . And relaxed car-pooling requirements . And tax_breaks . And maybe some help with locating a site for a new headquarters . And , of course , tax_breaks . &quot; Taxes seem to be pretty important , &quot; the official said . * Those involved in trying to keep Taco Bell here believe something greater is at stake than a glass tower filled with fast-food wizards . One thousand jobs in a 14-million job economy are , in the abstract , insignificant , but losing a corporate headquarters to another state is seen to have great symbolic weight . As the Irvine Chamber_of_Commerce president put it : &quot; Taco Bell ' s is a pivotal decision . If they leave , we ' ve lost a major effort to retain somebody . If they stay , we ' ve got a major win that we could use to anchor down others. &quot; Well , perhaps . Another way to look_at it is this . There are many reasons that Taco Bell has thrived in California . Population , location and lifestyle are but three . These reasons remain . And while the business climate might not be perfect , it was good_enough to put Taco Bell on the fast-food map . No , if Martin believes Texas is a better place to run his fast-food chain , so be it . Here ' s hoping he gets good Cowboys tickets . The greater danger here is not in losing the bean trust , but in_playing the game in the first place . Appease Taco Bell today , and expect a knock_on the door tomorrow from Carl ' s Jr. , or Jack in the Box , or Del Taco . What is given to one in a bidding_contest must be given to others , especially those who slugged through the same rough times without holding a gun to anyone ' s head . The symbolism , too , can cut both ways . Outfoxing grabby Texans might be fun , but there ' s something about letting a fast-food taco chain dictate terms to the state of California that doesn ' t quite sit right . In fact , it leaves a bad taste in the mouth . And write your own punch_line .</TEXT>
