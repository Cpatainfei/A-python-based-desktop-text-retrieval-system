   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; REPORTER ' S NOTEBOOK ; CYBERPRIVACY AND THE ' CLIPPER '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the annual Digital World conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center has been oddly free_of friction this year , that may change today , when Clinton Brooks of the National Security Agency meets civil libertarian and cyberspace legend Philip Zimmerman , author of a notorious data encryption program called Pretty Good Privacy , on a panel titled &quot; Privacy in the Digital World. &quot; Brooks is one of the leading forces behind the &quot; Clipper Chip , &quot; the government-designed microchip that would encrypt data sent over phone_lines -- if private industry ever agreed to use it . The catch is that the government would have the key to unlock the encrypted information , the idea being that criminal activity in a digitized form could thus be monitored , ostensibly with the necessary legal safeguards . The idea was supposed to be balancing the individual ' s right_to_privacy with society ' s need to combat crime at a time when more and more information is electronic . Brooks , who went_back and read the Federalist Papers in the course of developing his ideas on Clipper , says he ' s been shocked by the overwhelmingly negative reaction . &quot; This goes_to the core of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution , &quot; he says , &quot; but society isn ' t having a chance to address it. &quot; The NSA scientist said he looked first to the Internet in hopes of getting &quot; reasoned deliberation &quot; on the subject , but instead was hit with &quot; flames &quot; and hostility . * &quot; As I began to understand it , I realized the Internet is made_up of a lot of immature people , college_students for whom it is more fun to make easy snide comments instead of addressing the real issues , &quot; he said . Zimmerman has a stock comeback : &quot; I think I ought to be able to go_up and whisper in your ear even if your ear is 100 # 000 miles away . If we install Clipper , then we can ' t do that , because the government will have a back_door into our encrypted communications. &quot; But Brooks , deeply earnest , maintains : &quot; This country is the most vulnerable nation to the disruption of our information_systems because of our high-technology . We need to get_out of this petty bickering mode . I ' m hoping people here will sense from me that this wasn ' t some master conspiracy scheme by the government , so we can get_on_with the discussion. &quot; * Nathan Baulick , a multimedia developer from Minneapolis , was less concerned with the Clipper controversy than with Magenta , for whose reappearance he waited patiently . She was last seen dissolving into a glob of ones and zeros , or so it said on the computer_screen where Baulick sat in a corner of the cavernous Convention Center_on Tuesday . Baulick waited in one of BayMoo ' s hundreds of virtual rooms , described this way : The walls and floors of the root lodge are of soft earth . There are three small tables here , made of old pine . The chairs are also pine , and covered in soft paisley cushions . There is a flicker of soft candlelight . Bill the bartender is behind the old , wood bar . Like the roughly 1 # 200 others who thronged the fifth annual Digital World convention , Baulick had come_in order to catch_up on new technology and meet people from the converging industries of computing , entertainment , consumer electronics and telecommunications . But BayMoo , an all-text virtual_reality that anyone can add_to and play in over the Internet computer web , kind of drew him in . It ' s a kind of game known on-line as a Multi-User Dungeon , or MUD . &quot; She didn ' t ask me to follow her , &quot; he says to no one in particular as Magenta breezes in and out again . Don ' t worry -- you can play in the MUD too . Just telnet to mud.crl.com.8888. * Virtual worlds are , quel surprise , something of a theme at Digital World this year . Other_than Catapult , a new interactive firm launching an on-line video_game network service , the buzz of the conference was Knowledge Adventure Worlds , which has developed a prototype for AT &amp; T of an interactive 3-D virtual environment that may become a standard for the next generation of on-line services . The &quot; world &quot; that company President Dave Gobel demonstrated for a packed audience bore some resemblance to the interactive television interfaces phone_companies such_as Bell Atlantic and cable companies such_as Time Warner have been developing . You can move through rooms and down hallways and choose from a variety of theoretical services , such_as home shopping or games . And you can call_up a friend via modem and hang_out there together , using the keyboard to chat . But because KA Worlds uses mostly computer-generated graphics and character animation rather than video , plus a powerful compression technology , it doesn ' t require a fancy-schmancy broad-band network to make_it run . It works over regular telephone_lines and most personal_computers . It also does_away_with text-based pull-down menus , which can be a major turnoff to consumers unfamiliar_with computer software such_as Microsoft Windows . A spinoff of La Crescenta-based multimedia developer Knowledge Adventure , which maintains a minority stake in the firm , KA Worlds hopes companies across all industries will commission the firm to develop their own virtual worlds . For those who find the concept less than obvious , Gobel recommended &quot; Snow Crash , &quot; the recently published Neal Stephenson cyberpunk novel about a virtual realm called Metaverse , which he swears he didn ' t see an advance copy of before developing the product : &quot; Read it if you want to know our business plan. &quot; * Actually , if you want to be a member of the interactive digital age cyber-clique , you ' d better read it anyway . It was the last-read book of at least half an informal sampling of Digital World attendees , including Michele DiLorenzo , who was named chief of the newly restructured Viacom New Media on Tuesday . The move , which was expected after Viacom ' s acquisition of Paramount Communications earlier this year , combines Paramount ' s Palo Alto-based multimedia publishing arm , Paramount Interactive , with Viacom New Media , based in New York and Chicago . Viacom also announced the formation of a new group called Viacom Interactive Services , which includes the interactive TV groups of both companies , and creates a new position for former Paramount Technology Group chief Keith Schaefer , who will develop an on-line business strategy for the company from New York . Viacom executives said the reorganization would result in about five layoffs from the organization out of about 150 employees .</TEXT>
