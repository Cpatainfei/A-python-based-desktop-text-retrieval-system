   <HEADLINE> POLICE STEP UP ARRESTS IN BID TO ' RECLAIM ' MACARTHUR PARK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Capt . Nick Salicos , the new commanding_officer at the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Rampart Division , is conducting an experiment and his laboratory is MacArthur Park , once an urban oasis but tarnished in recent years by crime . Since assuming his post in November , Salicos has made safety at the 32-acre park a priority , increasing regular patrols to four -- consisting_of eight to 10 officers on foot or bikes spread_out over the day . &quot; I ' ve told the officers to stay there , don ' t leave , live there , even if it ' s slow , &quot; Salicos said . &quot; No matter how small the offense is , if it ' s a legitimate arrest , we ' re going to make_it . We ' re not tolerating any criminality. &quot; Within the first nine days of the cleanup , officers made 65 arrests . Two hundred arrests were made in the first three weeks , Salicos said . &quot; Two months ago , where there were prostitutes and dope dealers , there are now large_numbers of families and small children playing in the park , &quot; Salicos said . &quot; This little experiment is an exercise in what the LAPD can do when it has enough officers to reclaim a piece of turf. &quot; A group of park regulars sitting on a bench on the south_side of the park gave the cleanup a mixed review . One man said he has seen the same people back in the park selling drugs just days after they were arrested . And a woman said someone recently tried to sell her drugs while she was watching her granddaughter play . But others say the park is safer . &quot; It ' s getting better and it ' s a definite improvement over , say , three years ago , &quot; said Dorothy Loftus , who has been coming_to the park off and on since 1965 . &quot; People don ' t drink_in the park anymore because the police were arresting them. &quot; However , Loftus worried about the homeless people who used to sleep_in the park . &quot; I feel sorry_for them because the police kicked them out , &quot; she said . &quot; Where are they going_to go ? &quot; &quot; I hope it doesn ' t push people back into the alleys east of the park , &quot; said Tom Coyle , chairman of the Westlake Neighborhood Watch . &quot; Unless we ' re willing to have the police , health department and housing department hound people into getting the help they need , they ' re going to be a headache and burden to someone. &quot; A good park recreation program could reduce area gang activity significantly , Coyle said , but the park ' s layout and the lack of funds preclude large sports programs , such_as soccer games . Nevertheless , Coyle and others applauded Salicos for focusing_on the park , which is a key to revitalizing the neighborhood . &quot; The cops come_by to check_up_on things so it ' s much better now than before , &quot; said John Lopez , one of the regulars on a bench near 7th Street . &quot; People with kids are coming_back now. &quot; Another man suggested an additional improvement for the park : &quot; They need some latrines here , desperately. &quot;</TEXT>
