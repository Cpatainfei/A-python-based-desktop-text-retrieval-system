   <HEADLINE> ' I ' M A SIMPLE PERSON . . . A FAMILY_MAN , ' JAILED CARLOS PROTESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carlos the Jackal says he ' s just a family_man suffering &quot; moral assassination &quot; in captivity , a newspaper said Tuesday in a report that prompted an investigation of how it got the imprisoned terrorist ' s comments . Carlos , a native Venezuelan whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez , also denied he is an alcoholic or planned to have liposuction to remove stomach fat , the_French newspaper InfoMatin said . &quot; Today I want to testify , because I can ' t stay like this without reacting to everything that is being said of me , &quot; Carlos was quoted as saying from his isolation cell at La Sante prison in Paris . Prison officials , apparently viewing the report as a breach of security , said they are investigating how the paper got Carlos ' comments . InfoMatin told other news organizations it did not interview Carlos but obtained his comments &quot; indirectly. &quot; Prison_guards are forbidden to act_as intermediaries for such things , French officials said . Carlos ' lawyers denied involvement . It would be Carlos ' first public comments since he was captured in Sudan and brought_to France two weeks ago to stand trial in a string of bombings and killings in the 1970s and ' 80s . In the newspaper account , the 44-year-old Carlos portrays himself as misunderstood . &quot; Why are they trying to pass me off as an alcoholic ? &quot; he was quoted as saying . &quot; All of that is false . . . . &quot; I ' m a simple person . I ' m above all a family_man . My wife and my daughter live as normally as anyone in Venezuela , with my family. &quot; Carlos said he was caught after being &quot; betrayed by friendly leaders who had received me very generously , &quot; an apparent reference_to the Sudanese . &quot; But now that they ' ve neutralized me , instead of assassinating me physically , they are proceeding with a moral assassination. &quot;</TEXT>
