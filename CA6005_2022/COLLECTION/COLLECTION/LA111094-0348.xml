   <TEXT> The battle over Proposition 187 shifted quickly from the ballot_box to courtrooms , to government chambers and the streets Wednesday as Californians , in a resounding Election_Day mandate , ushered_in a new era of stern restrictions against illegal immigrants . Acting immediately to implement the measure for which he so vigorously campaigned , newly reelected Gov . Pete Wilson issued a toughly worded executive order directing health_care_providers to discontinue prenatal services and new admissions to nursing_homes for illegal immigrants . &quot; The people of California have passed Proposition 187 , now we must enforce it , &quot; said Wilson at a morning press_conference at a Los Angeles hotel . But critics of the controversial initiative had other plans , filing at least eight lawsuits in state and federal_courts throughout California . By midafternoon , a San Francisco Superior_Court judge , acting_on a lawsuit filed on behalf of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Unified School districts and the California School_Boards Assn. , temporarily barred enforcement of the proposition ' s requirement that illegal immigrants be excluded from California public_schools . In a separate action , the judge extended the order to public colleges and universities . Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , a federal_district judge presiding over a legal challenge brought by civil_rights groups ordered that he be notified of any &quot; substantive &quot; enforcement of the initiative prior to a court hearing he scheduled for next Wednesday . But spokesmen for Wilson and Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren said they would proceed in implementing the non-education portions of the initiative because the judge did not directly order them to halt such actions . Among the rapid-fire developments Wednesday following the measure ' s overwhelming passage by a 59 % -41 % margin : * Orange County school administrators promised not to report children to immigration officials , urging parents to keep students in schools , while health and social_services workers said they had no immediate plans for implementing the initiative . Small groups of high_school and college_students staged small rallies and discussions on campuses in Santa Ana and Fullerton , denouncing Wilson and the initiative and promising to get Latinos more involved in the political process . Local officials also pledged to join statewide lawsuits challenging Proposition 187 . * The Los Angeles City_Council voted 10-3 to direct city employees not to enforce any provisions of the measure , except its crackdown on the sale and possession of fake identity documents , until legal challenges have been completed . The council also voted to pursue legal_action to overturn the initiative , which bans illegal immigrants from government-funded non-emergency services and requires local officials to report those suspected of being illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities . * Religious_leaders and city officials urged residents to remain calm and called_on parents to continue sending their children to school . &quot; I urge all Angelenos to ignore rumors and to continue to express their opinions regarding this law in a peaceful manner , &quot; said Mayor Richard Riordan . * Clinton_Administration officials said they would take no &quot; precipitous &quot; action to cut federal funding to California for health , education and social_welfare programs , saying they would prefer to wait for the results of litigation aimed at thwarting the measure . Analysts have said that as much as $ 15 billion in annual federal funding is at risk because of certain of the initiative ' s requirements . * Several small anti-187 rallies took_place , including evening demonstrations Downtown and at Cal State Los Angeles , where about 250 protesters appeared . About 20 of the campus demonstrators were arrested after staging a sit-in that disrupted the opening of a fine_arts complex . Implementation Gov . Wilson , who used illegal immigration as a central focus of his reelection campaign , moved quickly Wednesday to begin implementing the get-tough Proposition 187 . &quot; Starting today , we insist that California be a state that can set its own priorities , &quot; the governor announced at his dramatic morning press_conference . Unveiling a two-page executive order , Wilson declared that prenatal services for illegal immigrants would &quot; be discontinued as soon as legally possible. &quot; The savings of about $ 84 million a year would be redirected to legal residents of California , the governor said . As a result , he said , about 1 # 000 additional working poor women could be served each month . Wilson also directed that future admissions to long-term nursing_home programs be granted only to legal residents . A spokeswoman later said the savings would amount to about $ 6 million a year since the state currently pays_for relatively few illegal immigrants to live_in nursing_homes . Although the ballot measure stated that illegal immigrants could no longer be served by publicly funded hospitals and health clinics , Wilson said he has the duty , as governor , to protect the health of the public . Therefore , he said , he will order all precautions be taken &quot; to deal with any threat of communicable_disease , whether through immunization or quarantine or other measures. &quot; Wilson also ordered a bevy of state agencies to draft emergency regulations to implement the ballot measure . In doing so , however , he took pains to say his Administration would not tolerate bigotry . The regulations , he said , would ensure &quot; the rights of all legal residents are protected and the provisions of Proposition 187 are implemented in a manner that avoids discrimination on the basis of national origin. &quot; Finally , Wilson sent a letter to President Clinton , with whom he has repeatedly clashed over federal payments for immigration costs , asking_for his &quot; full cooperation and assistance &quot; in implementing the initiative . &quot; I trust that you will agree that the people of California , having exercised their right as voters to enact Proposition 187 , should not as a result suffer any loss of federal funds , &quot; Wilson said . As Wilson plunged forward , so did Atty . Gen . Lungren , who has begun distributing blank forms to local law_enforcement departments and other agencies to be returned with the names of any suspected illegal immigrants . &quot; It ' s obvious that major portions of Proposition 187 will be challenged in both state and federal_courts , &quot; Lungren declared in a statement issued late Wednesday afternoon . &quot; The mere filing of these lawsuits should not be interpreted as an excuse to ignore the law. &quot; The high state officials ' sentiments were not universally shared . In Los Angeles , the City_Council voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to join in legal_action to set_aside Proposition 187 and directed its employees to continue providing services until the challenges are settled . &quot; I would like to remind us all that the distinguishing characteristic of a democracy is its protection of the rights of the minority , &quot; Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg , who wore a white armband reading &quot; I ' m an Illegal Alien , &quot; told her colleagues . The only dissent came from three San Fernando Valley council_members , Joel Wachs , Hal Bernson and Laura Chick . &quot; I opposed 187 as a voter and as a council_member , &quot; said Chick . &quot; But . . . we need to be very careful of how we govern. &quot; &quot; I can ' t participate in giving what I think is a misshapen message to the public . Part of the message is , ' We are smarter than you are. ' &quot; At an unusual gathering of Los Angeles city and county officials , in which leaders including Riordan and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke called_for calm , Police_Chief Willie Williams indicated that his department had no intention of making any immediate any changes . &quot; There is no change in the policies and procedures and actions of the Los Angeles Police_Department as of this morning , &quot; the chief said . At LAPD ' s South Bureau , where officers handle nearly a murder a day , overworked detectives said they cannot even keep_up with the growing roll of homicide victims , let alone begin asking arrestees for green_cards . &quot; I don ' t have enough detectives to check on my murders . So how am I going_to keep track of that administrative lunacy ? &quot; asked Lt . Sergio Robleto , commander of the Bureau ' s homicide detail . In Washington , Clinton_Administration officials , following a plan agreed on before Tuesday ' s vote , said they would make no immediate decision on how to act . &quot; we ' ll have to see where litigation takes us , &quot; an Administration official said . The Courtrooms In state and federal_courts in Los Angeles , San Francisco and Sacramento , a flurry of lawsuits -- at least eight , according to the attorney_general ' s count -- were filed within hours of Proposition 187 ' s passage . By late Wednesday morning , San Francisco Superior_Court Judge Stuart R . Pollak had issued the first temporary restraining order against the measure , saying that its educational bans could not be put_in place before further hearings . The ruling was hardly_a surprise . Sponsors and opponents of Proposition 187 have long agreed that a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision that granted illegal immigrants the right to a free public education would have to be reconsidered before the initiative ' s education ban could take_effect . Pollak , in_handing down his temporary restraining order early in the afternoon , cited that decision , Plyler vs . Doe . &quot; There are serious legal questions here , to say the least , that need to be resolved , &quot; said Pollak , noting the Supreme Court ruling &quot; seems to prohibit and invalidate at least portions of this measure. &quot; California Deputy Atty . Gen . Stephanie Wald , representing Wilson , opposed the order and argued that it was unnecessary because Proposition 187 ' s education prohibitions were not_due to go_into effect until January anyway . However , attorneys for the plaintiffs pointed to provisions in the measure that did appear to take_effect immediately and warned that some schools might try to prevent illegal immigrants from continuing in their classrooms . Pollak , considering the Los Angeles Unified suit and two others filed on behalf of students elsewhere , set a court date for Nov . 28 for arguments on whether to issue a preliminary injunction . Later Wednesday in Los Angeles , U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr . stopped short of formally and immediately barring implementation of the law , as a coalition of civil_rights groups and individuals requested in four additional lawsuits . But he strongly indicated he wanted enforcement of the entire measure held_in abeyance until both sides have time to present legal arguments . &quot; I want the court to be notified of any firm -- not rumor -- indication of enforcement of ( the measure ) in this time , &quot; Byrne said , extending the order to attorneys for both the state and the four groups of plaintiffs . &quot; It is the impact on individuals that I ' m concerned about , &quot; Byrne told Deputy Atty . Gen . Jon M . Ichinaga , who was representing state health agencies and Wilson ' s office . He ordered all parties to advise him in writing &quot; of any substantive &quot; action to enforce the measure . In the interim , Byrne said state officials may proceed with &quot; in-house &quot; preparations for enforcement of the measure without &quot; violating the spirit of what I ' m attempting to do. &quot; The sweeping suit by the civil_rights groups charges that the initiative unlawfully intrudes on federal jurisdiction over immigration and denies various constitutional rights partly by encouraging discrimination against persons who appear or sound foreign . &quot; What we have in_effect is no implementation , no enforcement of Proposition 187 , &quot; Antonia Hernandez , president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , told reporters . But Ichinaga interpreted the judge ' s words differently . He said Byrne clearly implied &quot; he would raise a concern &quot; if the measure was enforced in the next week . But Ichinaga added that Byrne &quot; did not issue an issue an injunction against the state . It seems to me he basically wants to know if it is implemented , but he didn ' t make any express ruling that it shouldn ' t be. &quot; Spokesmen for the governor and attorney_general quickly announced that the judge ' s action would not interfere with their implementation plans . Since Proposition 187 contains a severability clause , some sections could conceivably take_effect while others were still being debated in court cases . But legal_experts say suits could tie_up certain portions of the measure for anywhere from two to five years . Streets and Schools As dawn broke over California on Wednesday , it was business as usual for illegal immigrants who work as day_laborers , kitchen employees and in other jobs . &quot; We can ' t be afraid , we have to confront this issue , &quot; said Juan Carlos , 30 , a father of three , as he waited for work outside a Homebase store in Ladera Heights . &quot; It is either this or starve. &quot; Outside MacArthur Park in Los Angeles , a slender , grizzled man was loud and clear about offering fake identification documents , despite stiff new sanctions included in Proposition 187 . &quot; Micas , micas , &quot; he called_out in Spanish , using the term many residents know applies to driver ' s licenses , resident alien cards or Social_Security cards . A couple of blocks away , along another side of the park , a_few young_men who also sell illegal documents said they were keeping a lower profile than usual . &quot; Mica &quot; salesmen and other area residents said Proposition 187 will not change conditions for Latinos and others in the city who are struggling to survive . Most of those people will remain in the United States and will do what they can to earn some money , they said . At Martin_Luther King-Drew Medical_Center , meanwhile , business also proceeded pretty much as usual . &quot; We haven ' t been notified of any cancellation of appointments in any of our clinics , &quot; said spokeswoman Tassie Cleveland . A wave of introspection swept_over public_school campuses Wednesday morning , where just a week before student protests hit their peak with more_than 10 # 000 young people walking_out_of class in Los Angeles alone . A day after Proposition 187 ' s passage , there were only a handful of small protests involving fewer than 500 students . On the UC Irvine campus , about 150 students marched and chanted opposition to 187 from about 6:30 to 9 p.m. There were no incidents , campus security officials said . Meanwhile , school administrators grappled with ways to help students cope_with the disappointment . &quot; I ' m just too stunned to do anything , &quot; said Luz Castillo , a 17-year-old Reseda High_School student who just two weeks ago organized an anti-187 walkout and forum .
