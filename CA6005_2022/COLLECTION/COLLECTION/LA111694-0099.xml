   <HEADLINE> STREET BEAT : THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME : NOTES FROM THE FRONT ; ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Siddons was riding his bicycle , minding his own business , when all_of a sudden -- Wham ! -- he was sideswiped by a car making a right turn from a freeway exit in Woodland Hills . But like a broken record , the accident repeated itself again and again , at least 20 times , authorities said . Each time , he allegedly pressured the auto driver into paying him $ 20 to $ 75 in &quot; damages &quot; on the spot . And the last couple of times the Tarzana man ' s bike was hit , Los Angeles police_officers Humberto Fajardo and Theresa Gordon were watching . Fajardo and Gordon work undercover for the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Traffic Division ' s Staged Collision Unit , a 2-year-old outfit that investigates suspicious traffic accidents in cooperation with the state_Department of Justice and the National_Insurance Crime Bureau , an industry agency that serves as liaison between insurance_companies and law_enforcement . In the two years since the LAPD established staged accident units at each of its four bureaus , the Valley unit has made 60 arrests -- including Siddons -- and many_more cases are under way . The National_Insurance Crime Bureau , which investigates suspicious claims and accidents , estimates that about 40 % of more_than 8 # 000 suspicious accidents in its 13-state western regional area occurred in Southern California , according to Bob Chambers , the bureau ' s regional manager . The bureau ' s database includes customer information from most major carriers , an invaluable investigative tool , Fajardo said . Take the case of a Central California woman : the computer information showed that 14 members of her family had collected damages from traffic accidents in just two years . The woman was a &quot; capper , &quot; working for an unholy doctor-lawyer alliance often found at the base of such insurance scams , Fajardo said . &quot; She would come_down here for about half the year and stage accidents , then she would go_back home and run a private business she owned , &quot; Fajardo said . Fajardo learned that the woman would often gather all_the participants at the parking_lot at Valley College , where she would instruct them in what story to tell while their cars were taken_away and &quot; wrecked &quot; -- with artful damage that was often inflicted in cooperating auto body shops . Using information obtained through an informant , Fajardo met the woman in the summer of 1992 . Although she sometimes jokingly accused him of being a cop , he finally persuaded her , after six months , to let him make some money . So , one day in November , 1992 , he met her and her associates at a Van Nuys restaurant . While he waited , his car was taken_away . It was returned not more_than two hours later with a brand-new dent . Then the woman laid_out the scenario for the detective : &quot; The accident was your fault , you just weren ' t watching the road . This is the gas_station you called the police from , but they refused to respond to a non-injury accident . We exchanged information and went our separate ways , &quot; she told him . The scam was aimed at Fajardo ' s insurance_company , which would get hit with claims from other people in the ring , claiming to have been involved in the &quot; accident &quot; with him . The woman , convicted of fraud , served eight months of a three-year state_prison term , Fajardo said , and was ordered to pay $ 292 # 000 in restitution to insurance_companies for 180 accidents staged between 1984 and 1992 . The detective refused to identify the woman , even after her conviction , because he is still investigating members of her ring . Simple watch-and-arrest cases , like Siddons ' comparatively crude scam with faked bicycle accidents -- he is awaiting trial on 20 counts of extortion -- are rare , the officers say . Most of their investigations involve doctors , lawyers and a web of co-conspirators that can take years to unravel , Fajardo said . &quot; You can ' t arrest everybody right away , &quot; Fajardo said . &quot; It takes time to collect paperwork from the insurers , review the documents and then find_out the incriminating facts of a case. &quot; Chambers estimated that losses from staged accidents in Southern California will cost insurers $ 65 million this year . &quot; It ' s a big business , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
