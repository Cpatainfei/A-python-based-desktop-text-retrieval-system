   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; RELOCATED LACE EXPERIENCES SOME FIRST-SHOW JITTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The much-awaited relocation of Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions ( or LACE , as it is universally known ) from a warehouse district in downtown Los Angeles to a storefront in the center of downtown Hollywood has finally been accomplished -- and not a moment too soon . Lately it had seemed that the venerable , artist-run alternative space was in danger of being completely forgotten . Out of sight , out of mind . The art scene has been metamorphosing dramatically during the 15 years that the nonprofit gallery has been in_operation . Locally , nationally and internationally , the cultural landscape of 1994 would be unrecognizable to a time-traveling visitor from 1979 . For much of that time LACE changed with it . Fluidity is essential to the profile of an alternative space , since the seemingly inevitable institutionalization of art amounts to a cultural hardening of the arteries . That stale rigidity is what spaces like LACE are finally created to be alternatives to . The liveliness of an alternative space depends_on its ability to constantly reposition itself , in_order to keep as_many options as possible open for artists . In recent years , however , LACE has struggled to keep its artistic head above the churning water . Certainly there have been individual programs of note . But , overall , the organization seemed stuck , responsive more to parochial or clubbish interests than to artists ' clear-eyed assessments of the larger art scene , and of how to bust_up the restrictions it inevitably imposes on our cultural life . As with the organization ' s earlier relocation from the third floor above a bridal shop on downtown L.A. ' s Broadway to a free-standing building in a nearby industrial warehouse district , the move to Hollywood was engineered with the help of the Community Redevelopment Agency . The shift to a highly visible street location on Hollywood Boulevard signals a welcome shot of revitalization for LACE . There ' s still a good bit of work to be done , some of it on the reconfigured but still pleasantly scruffy building . More important , as the inaugural show attests , the exhibition program needs to sharpen its focus . Architecturally , the structure is plainly well-considered in its redesign , while far from spit-and-polished ; that mix is appropriate for an alternative space for art . The 4 # 000-square-foot storefront -- formerly a beauticians ' school , wryly enough -- has been reconfigured by architect ( and LACE board_member ) Frederick Fisher to create two exhibition galleries , a performance and film theater , a video gallery and office space . Ceilings are high , floors are plywood . The smaller exhibition gallery in front is open and inviting , thanks to street-side glass walls that casually entice passersby to look inside . In the main exhibition gallery , reached through an unadorned yet monumental doorway , some of the building ' s original , Streamline Moderne detailing peaks through , acknowledging layers of past use . The inaugural exhibition , elliptically titled &quot; Nor Here Neither There , &quot; has been organized by a team composed of three artists ( whose own work bears scant resemblance to one another ) and by a curator for a major LACE patron . Artists Charles Gaines , Paul McCarthy and Stephen Prina , together with curator Fran Seegull , have , as the show ' s title suggests , abandoned all claims on a unified theme . Instead , each apparently chose a_few artists whose work they admire , and here they all are . The selection doesn ' t appear entirely random , though . The 13 artists are based in a variety of cities ( mostly in the United States , but one in Vancouver and one in Berlin ) , and they work in just about every medium , including photography , video , performance , sculpture , painting and installation . No singular artistic strategy is encountered within a single medium . Assemblage , for example , is as diverse as the grubby street-poetics of Nari Ward ' s jaunty &quot; Sky Juice , &quot; in which an iron gate clotted with rags sports an umbrella festooned with melted-plastic soda_bottles , and the spotless , low-tech computer-space implied by Chris Finley ' s eccentric stacks of synthetic paraphernalia . The most captivating work is Stan Douglas ' projected video , &quot; Monodramas , &quot; which is accompanied by a group of 10 photographs with texts . The latter are like miniature shooting_scripts , several of which are acted_out in the brief video vignettes . Each less than a minute , the monodramas tell banal tales of random suburban encounters , all_in gorgeously saturated color , and all strangely haunted ( or haunting ) in their peculiar ordinariness . Looking_at the &quot; Monodramas &quot; is like stumbling onto crime scenes . Douglas manages to pack each one with enough mundane but compelling detail to make a viewer curious , while also ensuring that no two viewers are likely to come_up with the same interpretive story . It ' s likely that &quot; Nor Here Neither There &quot; means to stand as a declaration of breadth , inclusiveness and multiplicity for LACE ' s program , which isn ' t a bad idea for an inaugural show . But , overall , neither is this a particularly memorable offering -- one that rivets attention and makes you eager for more . To unravel its title : The show is , in fact , rather too close to being &quot; neither here nor there &quot; in feeling . You don ' t just consider the art ; instead , it feels as if each work has been asked not merely to speak_for itself , but to represent a constituency . To recognize the particularity of different artistic voices is commendable , but the sense of singularity achieved by unforgettable exhibitions has been sacrificed . * LACE , 6522 Hollywood Blvd. , ( 213 ) 624-5650 , through July 21 . Closed Mondays and Tuesdays .</TEXT>
