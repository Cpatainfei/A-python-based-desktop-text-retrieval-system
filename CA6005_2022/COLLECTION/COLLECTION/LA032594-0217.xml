   <HEADLINE> EXCERPTS : CLINTON SUPPORTS ' CLEARING THE WAY FOR HEARINGS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following are excerpts from President Clinton ' s news_conference Thursday : . . . I know that many people around America must believe that Washington is overwhelmingly preoccupied with the Whitewater matter . But our Administration is preoccupied with the business we were sent here to do for the American people . The investigation of Whitewater is being handled by an independent special counsel whose appointment I supported . Our cooperation with that counsel has been total . We have supplied over 14 # 000 documents , my tax_returns dating_back to 1978 , and made available every Administration witness he has sought . I support the actions of the House and the Senate clearing the way for hearings at an appropriate time that does not interfere with Mr. Fiske ' s responsibilities , and I will fully cooperate with their work as well . Tax_Returns to 1977 Tomorrow , I will make available my tax_returns dating_back to 1977 when I first held public office . Cooperation , disclosure and doing the people ' s business are the order_of_the_day . . . . Question : You just said that you would release your tax_returns back to 1977 . Questions also have been raised about whether you made money or lost money in your Whitewater investment . Do you still believe that you lost about $ 70 # 000 , and do you have any reason to believe that you owe any back taxes ? Answer : I am certain that we lost money . I do not believe we owe any back taxes . If it is determined that we do , of course we will pay . I am now sure that we lost something less than $ 70 # 000 based on an interview I heard on television -- or I heard about on television with Jim McDougal on one of the networks where he said that he felt that one of the loans I had taken from a bank where we also borrowed money for the land_development corporation -- he said he thought one of those was a personal_loan . So I started racking my brain to try to remember what that might have been . And by coincidence , I was also rereading the galleys of my mother ' s autobiography , just fact-checking it , and I noticed that she mentioned there something that I had genuinely forgotten , which is that I helped her to purchase the property and what was then a cabin on the place that she and her husband , Dick Kelly , lived back in 1981 , and that I was a co-owner of that property with her for just a_few months . After they married , he bought my interest out . So that ' s where that -- I borrowed the money to go_in in that investment . I paid the money back with interest . That was unrelated to Whitewater . All the other losses we have documented to date we believe clearly are tied to the investment Hillary and I made in Whitewater . So we in fact lost some $ 20 # 700 less than the Lyons report indicated because that loan came from a different place , and then -- or came for different purposes . And there was another $ 1 # 500 payment I made on it , so whatever the total in the Lyons report was should be -- you should distract -- or subtract from that $ 20 # 700 and another $ 1 # 500 . And we believe we can document that clearly . . . . Question : Do you know of any funds , any money -- Whitewater seems to be about money -- having gone_into any of your gubernatorial campaigns or into Whitewater , particularly federally insured money ? Do you know of any money that could have gone_in ? Answer : No . I have no knowledge of that . I have absolutely no knowledge of that . Question : You just mentioned James McDougal , your former business partner . A lot of questions have been raised about his business practices . Can you tell us what drew you to him to begin with and whether or not you still have faith now that he was -- that he is an honest businessman ? Answer : Well , I can tell you that , when I entered my relationship with him . . . I knew Mr. McDougal and had known him for many years . I met him in the late ' 60s when he was running Sen . Fulbright ' s office in Arkansas . I knew that sometime around that time , perhaps later , he got_into the real_estate business . . . . Money Loss No Surprise The reason we lost money on Whitewater is not surprising . A lot of people did at that time . Interest_rates , as you ' ll remember , went_through the roof in the early ' 80s . People stopped immigrating to my state to retire , at least in the numbers they had all during the ' 70s . And the market simply changed . So we didn ' t sell as_many lots , and the venture was not successful . So we lost the money . Principally the money I lost was_on the interest payments I had to make on the loans which were never reimbursed because the venture never turned a profit . . . . Question : Congressman Leach made some very dramatic charges today . He said the Whitewater is really about the arrogance of power . And he didn ' t just mean back in Arkansas . He said that federal regulators tried to stop investigators for the Resolution Trust Corp . in Kansas City from putting Whitewater into their criminal referrals . That would amount to a cover-up and possibly obstruction of justice . Do you have any knowledge of that ? Answer : Absolutely not . . . . It ' s my understanding that Mr. Leach was rather careful in the words that he used , and apparently he didn ' t even charge that any political appointee of our Administration had any knowledge of this . So he may be talking_about an internal dispute within the RTC from career Republican appointees , for all I know . Keep_in mind , until I came here all_the appointees of the RTC were hired under previous Republican administrations . There has never been a Democratic President since there ' s been an RTC . And I can tell you categorically I had no knowledge of this and was not involved in it in any way , shape , or form . Question : In light of all that ' s happened , do you think you made any mistakes in the initial investment and in the way the White_House has handled this ? Answer : I certainly don ' t think I made a mistake in the initial investment . It was a perfectly honorable thing to do . And it was a perfectly legal thing to do . And I didn ' t make any money , I lost money . I paid my debts . And then later on . . . Hillary and I tried to make_sure that the corporation was closed_down in an appropriate way and paid any obligations that it owed after we were asked to get involved at a very late stage and after Mr. McDougal had left the S &amp; L . . . . Question : You ' ve been kind of tough at times on people you felt made_out during the ' 80s and didn ' t pay their fair share . Can you tell us here tonight that you have abided_by the very high ethical standard -- Answer : Absolutely . Question : -- To which you ' ve sought to hold others ? And also , if it turns_out that you do owe something in back taxes , will you be prepared perhaps to revise some of those judgments you ' ve made about others ? Answer : No , not at all . I ask you to tell the American people what percentage of my income I paid in taxes in every year where I reported my tax_returns . And let me tell you what my wife and I spent the ' 80s doing . I was the lowest-paid governor of any state in the country . I don ' t complain about it , I was proud_of that . I didn ' t do_it for the money . I worked_on creating jobs and improving education for the children of my state . Every year I was governor , my wife worked in a law_firm that had always done business with the state . She never took any money for any work she did for the state and , indeed , she gave_up her portion of partnership income that otherwise came_to the firm , and instead , every year gave an enormous percentage of her time to public_service work , helping children and helping education and doing a lot of other things , giving_up a lot of income . . . . I would remind you that we , like most middle-class folks , we turned our records over to an accountant , we did everything -- I always told the accountant to resolve all doubts in favor of the government , I never wanted any question raised about our taxes . When it turned_out in our own investigation of this Whitewater business that one year we had inadvertently taken a tax_deduction for interest payments when in fact it was a principal payment , even though the statute of limitations had run , we went_back and voluntarily paid what we owed to the federal_government . And if it turns_out we ' ve made some mistake inadvertently , we will do that again . . . . Question : So many things have happened since this Whitewater story broke or resurfaced , depending_on your point_of_view . Your counsel has resigned . A number of your top aides have been subpoenaed because of their contacts with Treasury officials in on the investigation . I ' m curious . Who do you blame more_than anything else for the Whitewater mess that the Administration is in now ? Answer : I don ' t think it ' s useful to get_into blame . I think what ' s important is that I answer the questions that you have that are legitimate questions , that I fully cooperate with the special counsel , which was requested widely by the press and by the members of the Republican_Party and who is himself a Republican , that we fully cooperate . And we ' ve done that . . . . Enough Blame to Go Around And then I get_back to the work of getting unemployment down , jobs up , passing a health_care bill , passing the crime bill , moving this country forward . I think the worst thing that can happen is for me to sort of labor over who should blame -- who should be blamed by this . There will probably be enough blame to go_around . . . . Question : You and your wife have both used the phrase &quot; bewildered , confused &quot; about why all_the interest in Whitewater . Yet in the Arkansas savings and loan business your wife represented Madison Savings &amp; Loan before the Arkansas savings and loan board , whose head was a former lawyer who had done_work for Madison Savings &amp; Loan . Do you not see any conflicts_of_interest in your action or your wife ' s actions which would appear to contradict what you just said about her not doing any work before the state that would cause people to question her actions ? Answer : No , that ' s not what I said . I said that when my wife did business , when her law_firm represented some state agency itself -- state agencies all_over America use private lawyers -- if she did any work for the state , she never took any pay_for it . . . . Was there anything wrong with her representing a client before a state agency ? And if you go_back and look_at the facts , basically the firm wrote the securities commissioner a letter saying &quot; Is it permissible under Arkansas law to raise money for this S &amp; L in this way ? &quot; And it showed that she was one of the contacts on it . And the securities commissioner wrote her back and said it ' s not against the law . . . . These kinds of things happen when you have married_couples who have professions , and the most important thing there is disclosure . There was no sneaking around about this , this was_full disclosure . . . . Question : You said a_few minutes ago that the people in the RTC who are involved in Congressman Leach ' s allegations are all career Republican officials . But aren ' t they members of your Administration , and do you plan to take any action in speaking either to Mr. Bentsen or Mr. Altman about taking action and investigating Mr. Leach ' s charges ? Answer : I think the last thing in the world I should do is talk to the Treasury_Department about the RTC . You all have told me that that creates the appearance of impropriety . I don ' t think we can have a -- it ' s not just a one-way_street , it ' s a two-way_street . Mr. Leach will see that whatever should be done is done , but I can tell you I have had no contact with the RTC , I ' ve made no attempt to influence them , and you can see by some of the decisions that they have made that that is the furthest thing , it seems to me , that ought to be_on your mind . . . Questioning the First_Lady Question : . . . When do you think it would be proper for the First_Lady to answer questions about Whitewater ? Answer : . . . The First_Lady has done several interviews . She was out_in three different places last week answering questions exhaustively from the press . I think she will continue to do that . And if you have questions you want to ask her about this , I think you ought to ask the questions . Question : I take it that the tax_returns you ' re putting_out tomorrow are the ones that have already gone_to the special counsel . If the special counsel wanted to question you about that , would you answer a subpoena ? Would Mrs . Clinton ? And what about congressional hearings ? What would be the protocol on going before Congress to explain it to them ? Answer : We decided in addition to putting_out the ' 78 and ' 79 returns we should go_ahead and put_out the ' 77 returns , that that would be an appropriate starting_point , because that ' s the year I first entered public life . . . . In terms of the information , I expect that the special counsel will want to question me and will want to question the First_Lady . It ' s my understanding that typically in the past it ' s been done_in a different way . I mean , I will cooperate with him in whatever way he decides is appropriate . Similarly , if Congress wants any information direct from us , we will of course provide it to them in whatever way seems most appropriate . Again , I understand there are certain protocols which have been followed in the past which I would expect would be followed here , but I intend to be fully cooperative so that I can go_back to work doing what I was hired to do . . . .</TEXT>
