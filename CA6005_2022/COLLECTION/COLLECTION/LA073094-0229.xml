   <HEADLINE> NFL SPIRIT LIVES ON IN SPAIN ; PRO FOOTBALL : RAIDER-BRONCO EXHIBITION , RETURN OF THE BARCELONA DRAGONS ARE AMONG SIGNS THAT INTEREST IS GROWING DESPITE POPULARITY OF SOCCER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The blow knocked Pau Coll down . He was dizzy . He was in pain . He was in heaven . Coll had played soccer all his life , understandable because he had grown_up in Spain . But then he got a chance to go_to another part of the world , and his own world was never the same . Coll went_to the United States for one year of high_school as an exchange student , winding_up in Texas near Amarillo . Much as soccer is the closest thing to religion in Europe , such is the case with football in Texas . Only in Texas , it ' s not so easy to distinguish between the two . When Coll asked if he could take a shot at playing this American futbol for his new school , his coach naturally made him a kicker . No problem for Coll . But also , no satisfaction . &quot; I want to hit and get hit , &quot; he said . So , with sly smiles on their faces , the coaching staff put him on the defensive line to get a taste of it and , sure enough , on the first play , down Coll went . &quot; It felt great ! &quot; says Coll , now 24 , as he stood on the sideline Friday at a Raider practice . Coll , who is acting_as an interpreter for the team this week while it prepares_for Sunday ' s exhibition opener against the Denver Broncos in Barcelona ' s Montjuic Stadium , still has excitement in his voice as he spoke_of his initiation into the world of football , even though the experience occurred more_than six years ago . After finishing his year of high_school , Coll came_home , but he brought his new toy_with him . &quot; What a funny-looking ball , &quot; said one of his old friends in Barcelona . &quot; How do you kick it ? &quot; There was nothing funny about it to Coll . &quot; Let ' s talk_about real football , &quot; he replied . And soon , they were doing more_than talking . Coll had his friends on the beach playing seven on seven . &quot; We didn ' t use any pads or anything , &quot; he says . &quot; There were lots of bruises , plenty of teeth flying. &quot; Once his friends caught some of Coll ' s enthusiasm , they inquired about purchasing football equipment from America . They spent about $ 400 each on shoulder_pads and about $ 250 on helmets . Coll and his friends proved to be in the vanguard of a movement that was growing in Spain . With exposure to American_football through television , interest in the sport was_on the rise in 1988 , just about the time Coll returned home . Football had already made inroads in Italy , where a coach , Angelo Vettese , was working with young players . Six years ago , Vettese came_to Spain and formed the Badalona Drags football squad . Today , football is bigger than ever in Spain . There are 53 amateur teams playing in two leagues nine months of the year . And the Barcelona Dragons are about to return . After a one-year hiatus , the World League is back , bringing with it Barcelona ' s franchise , which operated in both 1991 and ' 92 . The football / soccer comparisons that are going_on in the United States this summer as a result of the World Cup similarly are being made here in Spain . Nobody would dare hint that football will ever overtake soccer here , much as no one in America would predict that the World Cup would ever overshadow the Super Bowl . But much as there is a feeling that the two sports can coexist in America , such is the sentiment here as well . &quot; There is a refusal by the older people to get interested in American_football , &quot; says Cristina Cubero , a reporter for El Mundo Deportivo , a Spanish sports newspaper . &quot; They are addicted to soccer . But many of the young people like American_football because it is so different . They are getting tired_of soccer. &quot; Doesn ' t football ' s violence turn_off Spanish fans ? &quot; They find it fascinating , &quot; Cubero says . &quot; It ' s not like the players are trying to kill each other . It is a contact_sport . We have no other contact_sport . We have very little hockey in this country . ( Football ) is the most contact we can get. &quot; According to Rafael Cervera , who will work in the front office for the reincarnated Dragons , only about 15 % of the crowds who attended Dragon games in the past really understood football . &quot; About 35 % liked the hard-hitting and the long bombs , &quot; he says . &quot; And the other 50 % were just happy to feel_like they were in America for three hours . And they liked to look_at the cheerleaders. &quot; The first year , the Dragons averaged about 28 # 000 a game . The second season , that figure grew to 32 # 000 . This time around , they are hoping to average about 35 # 000 in 54 # 000-seat Montjuic Stadium . Coll , who played for the Dragons the first time , is taking_part in tryouts to regain his spot on the roster . But working for the Raiders this week has exposed him to the huge gap between the talent level of the Dragons and that of the NFL , a league he still dreams of playing in . On the field , Raider quarterback Vince Evans fires a long pass to Rocket Ismail . &quot; that ' s perfection , &quot; Coll says on the sidelines.BARCELONA DRAGONS ( FOOTBALL_TEAM ) LOS ANGELES RAIDERS ( FOOTBALL_TEAM )</TEXT>
