   <HEADLINE> CITY DRAINS SOME RESERVE_FUNDS TO PAY FOR ARTS PLAZA ; THOUSAND OAKS : THE FINANCING PLAN RELIES HEAVILY ON DEBT . BUT LEADERS SAY THE $ 86-MILLION COMPLEX IS WORTH IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In their crusade to boost Thousand Oaks ' stature by building a world-class stage and a monumental government center , city leaders have stripped money from an array of municipal accounts , emptying some reserves to pay_for the $ 86-million Civic Arts Plaza . Led by Mayor Alex Fiore , council_members have shoveled cash from at least a dozen city accounts into the towering complex . They have patched together a financing plan that relies heavily on debt : bonds and internal loans account_for nearly 75 % of the total Civic Arts Plaza budget . City officials say the performance complex and new City_Hall are worth the mammoth expense . The arts center , which officially opens tonight , will serve for decades as a building of note in Southern California -- and as a community rallying point . By raiding reserve_funds to pay_for the project , however , officials have tied_up money that otherwise could have been used to pave roads , run libraries , build trails and maintain countless other city services . And despite prior assurances , city officials now say several of those accounts may never be repaid . To fund the Civic Arts Plaza , city officials have also sunk the downtown Redevelopment Agency heavily into debt and left little money for its broader task -- sprucing_up the rest of Thousand Oaks Boulevard . The Redevelopment Agency has issued nearly $ 43 million in bonds to pay_for the Civic Arts Plaza , and has borrowed another $ 18.5 million from the city . For years , Thousand Oaks has been the Ventura County city most flush with reserves for future projects and emergencies . But with so_much money dedicated to the performing arts center , the Redevelopment Agency will have &quot; very little margin &quot; over the next few years , Finance Director Bob Biery said . &quot; We have a_few dollars for the boulevard , but nothing of major consequence. &quot; Even the city ' s long-standing promise to use redevelopment bond money for an auditorium at Thousand Oaks High_School and a stadium at Westlake High may be in jeopardy , city officials acknowledged . * Biery still hopes to meet those commitments by refinancing existing debt and issuing new bonds in 1995 . But both he and City_Manager Grant Brimhall said funding for the school projects depends largely on issues out of Thousand Oaks ' control , such_as national interest_rates and the state ' s financial health . If the state grabs money from redevelopment agencies to balance its budget , as it has for the past several years , &quot; we have a problem , &quot; Biery said . &quot; I can ' t put it any more directly. &quot; Still , Brimhall and Biery repeated reassurances this week that Thousand Oaks remains on solid fiscal footing . They note that the city owns a half-dozen valuable parcels , which could be sold to raise tens of millions of dollars . &quot; Anyone who would really like to be fair and honest about this ( project ) would have to say , ' Yeah , it ' s all_right , ' &quot; Brimhall said . &quot; This is a good , strong , solid city. &quot; The Civic Arts Plaza , approved in 1990 , was to have been paid_for fully by a combination of redevelopment funds , the sale of two old city_halls , and rent payments from the local park district for space in the new complex . But when the economy soured , that plan collapsed . In a depressed real_estate market , city officials could not unload their old city_hall for a good price , so they postponed the sale of the property at 401 W . Hillcrest Drive -- leaving a huge gap in arts plaza funding . * Meanwhile , the park district pulled_out of plans to rent $ 2 million worth of space . And interest_rates fell sharply , so money that city officials had invested earned lower-than-anticipated returns . Consequently , Biery and Brimhall had to overhaul the Civic Arts Plaza budget again and again , juggling city resources to find money to pay construction bills . With the council ' s approval , the city dipped first into a capital fund supported by developers ' fees from the giant Shapell and Dos Vientos projects . The city then wiped_out a $ 1-million account reserved for parks and trails . Finally , the city borrowed $ 13 million from a variety of municipal funds , including those set_aside to freshen_up the city golf_course , update city computers and build housing for low income residents . The council majority -- Fiore , Frank Schillo and Judy Lazar -- has consistently defended their decision to funnel cash from a dozen flush accounts into the Civic Arts Plaza . &quot; ( The money ) is being used for a city purpose , &quot; Lazar said . &quot; It ' s not like it ' s being expended for something that is of no use to the city . That , to me , is the bottom line. &quot; As the Civic Arts Plaza ' s stunning purple-hued auditorium opens , Lazar and other city leaders will congratulate themselves on finally bringing star-studded culture -- and Hollywood glitz -- to Thousand Oaks . They have often declared that the Civic Arts Plaza represents the city ' s crowning achievement , the last project needed to transform Thousand Oaks into a self-sufficient , enviably endowed community . * &quot; It ' s the culmination of the dreams of a lot of people , &quot; Lazar said . &quot; What we have is a stellar facility that ' s a credit to the community. &quot; But critics see more debits than credits . Councilwoman Elois Zeanah , who leads the Civic Arts Plaza opposition , said she fears Thousand Oaks ' prized new &quot; castle &quot; will continue to pull money from worthy community projects . &quot; It ' s a house of cards , &quot; Zeanah said flatly . &quot; It ' s a shell game. &quot; Clutching a folder stuffed with documents tracing the Civic Arts Plaza ' s tangled funding , Zeanah added : &quot; ( The council majority ) wanted this project so_much . . . that they were willing to put the city on the financial brink. &quot; When selling the project to the public , the city_stated that it had enough bonds , excess land and existing construction money &quot; in the bank &quot; to build the arts plaza . &quot; There is no use of General Fund tax or fee revenues . . . in the project , and thus no impact on city operations or normal Capital Improvement Program , &quot; Fiore and Schillo wrote in a 1990 memo to the council . But just eight months later , the council agreed to pull more_than $ 1.8 million from the general fund to buy land for the arts plaza . Billed as a loan , that sum is supposed to be repaid with interest . So far , however , the council has not replenished the general fund , an account that pays_for a wide variety of basic city services such_as police protection . * Schillo said he approved the use of general fund cash because the land purchase was an unexpected expense . Original sketches of the arts plaza had not indicated that the city would need to purchase that particular chunk of land , he said , so he considered it an &quot; add-on &quot; appropriate to fund with a loan from the general fund . As for his promise to refrain_from using general fund tax and fee revenues , Schillo said that statement applied only to the project ' s construction costs , not the land prices . Even that narrow interpretation , however , has been tested as city officials have struggled to pay arts plaza bills . The construction budget includes more_than $ 3 million in_general fund cash -- money that had been set_aside to repair the old city_hall on Hillcrest Drive . With that fund stripped bare , the council will need to find fresh money to refurbish the dilapidated building , which has been vandalized so badly that officials have said they are embarrassed to show it to potential buyers . One local real_estate_broker has estimated that cost at $ 500 # 000 . The Civic Arts Plaza ' s budget also draws deeply on the city ' s capital fund , an account earmarked for construction projects ranging from storm drains to ball_fields . * The capital fund , which once held as much as $ 20 million , has kicked_in $ 6.1 million in loans for the arts plaza land and construction budgets . Another $ 3.25 million from the capital fund was not designated as a loan , and thus will never be repaid . Despite the drawdown , city officials say the capital fund maintains an adequate reserve of $ 11 million . &quot; This will not adversely affect our ability to deliver any services , now or in the future , &quot; City_Manager Brimhall said . But Finance Director Biery said most of the remaining capital fund cushion has been reserved for traffic_signals , tree plantings and road improvements . That leaves few dollars for the kind of projects Zeanah covets : sound walls , bike paths , sidewalks and playing fields . &quot; We have drawn down all our reserves , &quot; Zeanah said . &quot; that ' s no way for a rich city to behave. &quot; Lazar defended the city ' s capital improvement program . Baseball_diamonds and soccer fields , she said , should be the responsibility of the park district . As for residents ' other needs , Lazar said she believes Thousand Oaks has juggled demands skillfully . &quot; We have done a good job , &quot; she said . &quot; We have looked_at what our most pressing needs are , and we have tried to meet them. &quot; Lazar and her colleagues have consistently promised to restore every depleted account , repaying every loan with interest . Yet Brimhall acknowledged this week that the city may never settle all_of its debts . * Thousand Oaks has no obligation to repay $ 6.1 million in loans from the capital fund , or $ 4 million from an account set_aside to upgrade city equipment , Brimhall said . A penny-pinched future council could write_off those debts , he said . &quot; We think we can , we think we will , &quot; Brimhall said . &quot; ( But ) there is no legal requirement that ( the money ) be paid back. &quot; The city ' s ability to repay the capital fund depends primarily on future real_estate transactions . Thousand Oaks officials are counting_on raising millions from the sale of 401 W . Hillcrest Drive -- the bunker-like former city_hall that juts_out of a grassy , brush-studded slope overlooking The Oaks mall . The last appraisal five years ago pegged the land value at up_to $ 14 million . But that estimate was based on splitting the 35-acre parcel into three lots : one for 10 residential units , one for a restaurant site , and the third for commercial development . Because the council has not yet considered rezoning the parcel , Zeanah has blasted the appraisal as unrealistic . * And even Fiore has conceded that Thousand Oaks might have to sell_off other surplus land to fully fund the Civic Arts Plaza if the 401 W . Hillcrest Drive property does not fetch top dollar . The city ' s most valuable asset is situated next door to the Civic Arts Plaza -- the 11 acres slated for private development at the east end of the former Jungleland wild animal park . Brimhall estimated the property ' s value at about $ 9 million , and said the city has been receiving &quot; big , big nibbles &quot; from interested developers . Other surplus city properties include two_dozen residential lots off California 23 , which Brimhall valued at about $ 2.5 million ; the former Goebel Senior Center across Conejo School Road from the Civic Arts Plaza , and the old Fitzgerald House , a small residential property . Backed by these assets worth more_than $ 20 million , Thousand Oaks will be able to meet its debts and repay its loans , Brimhall said . But he added that untangling the internal money transfers is not urgent . &quot; What needs to be straightened_out ? &quot; he asked . &quot; There ' s no life-and-death issues here. &quot; The city accounts most severely depleted are the insurance reserve_fund , the low- and moderate-income housing fund , and the fixed-asset replacement fund . * The insurance reserve_fund , designated to cover the city ' s liability in case the government loses a major court case , loaned more_than $ 4 million to the project . The fund now contains just $ 400 # 000 . * The fund to support affordable housing lost half its reserves , plummeting to $ 500 # 000 . Before approving the loan , council_members stipulated that returning money to that account must be a top priority . * The fixed-asset fund , which is used to replace worn-down city equipment , loaned $ 4 million to the Civic Arts Plaza . That left just $ 800 # 000 in the account . Biery and Brimhall said they believe the cushion will be sufficient to meet the city ' s needs . * The park fund , fed by a $ 50-per-bedroom tax on residential development , was wiped_out entirely to pay_for the Civic Arts Plaza ' s seven-acre park . That $ 1 million was not considered a loan , so it will not be repaid , Biery said . From Zeanah ' s point_of_view , the raids on various city funds belie officials ' repeated claims that the Civic Arts Plaza was completed on_time and under budget . &quot; To me , there ' s a revenue side of the budget and an expenses side of the budget , &quot; she said . &quot; The revenue side was in_trouble from the very beginning . We have never been_on budget. &quot; Schillo , however , feels certain that the city ' s financial plan will be vindicated and the Civic Arts Plaza will become a smash success . &quot; Listen , &quot; he said , &quot; we have had a history of years and years and years of doing the right thing after well-thought-out proposals are thoroughly discussed . We are doing that same thing here. &quot; FYI Tonight ' s grand-opening concert at the Civic Arts Plaza begins with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on stage at 8 .
