   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE SET TO RETURN ; EDWARDS IS LIKELY LANDING_SITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Atlantis ' six astronauts wrapped_up their work in orbit Sunday as scientists gloated over the amount of data collected during the 11-day mission to map ozone in Earth ' s atmosphere . One ozone monitor aboard Atlantis gathered enough data to fill 120 # 000 computer floppy_disks . &quot; We ' ve got some science teams here that are quite well-fed , &quot; said NASA mission scientist Tim Miller . The shuttle ' s scheduled landing this morning at the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by Tropical Storm Gordon . NASA sent the astronauts ' families to California on Sunday to await a probable landing there . The astronaut corps ' chief , Robert Cabana , also headed west to supervise the touchdown . Two other space shuttles have been diverted to the desert runways at Edwards Air_Force Base in the past two months because of storms . Atlantis ' first landing opportunity was about 7:30 a.m. EST at the space center . &quot; In one word , the forecast . . . is lousy , &quot; said flight director Jeff Bantle . &quot; There are going_to be low clouds . There ' s going_to be rain . There ' s going_to be gale-force wind. &quot; The outlook for Tuesday is just as bad . Good_weather was forecast for Edwards ; Bantle said the shuttle could land there later this morning if necessary . In anticipation of a California landing , shuttle commander Donald McMonagle played a recording of the theme from the old TV_show &quot; Route 66 &quot; for Mission Control late Sunday . This is the 66th space shuttle mission . &quot; I have the ' 56 T-Bird convertible parked outside . When we get_off watch , I ' m going_to try to make_it ( to California ) , &quot; Mission Control ' s Mario Runco joked . &quot; If you can get_it there , we ' ll drive it home , &quot; McMonagle replied . Atlantis had enough power to stay in orbit until Tuesday -- possibly Wednesday if extreme conservation measures were taken , said mission operations director Lee Briscoe . It costs about $ 1 million to transport a shuttle back to the space center atop a modified Boeing 747 jumbo jet . NASA also loses a week in getting the shuttle ready for its next flight . Atlantis isn ' t scheduled to fly again until late May or early June , but that is to be 1995 ' s biggest mission , the first shuttle docking with Russia ' s space_station , Mir . NASA must install a docking mechanism on Atlantis as soon as it returns to the space center . The storm that threatened to divert the shuttle to California toppled tents Sunday at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , but did little damage . No serious injuries were reported among the 23 # 000 Cuban and 6 # 000 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo . Two military_personnel received minor injuries when tents fell , a base spokesman said . Gordon packed sustained winds of up_to 45 m.p.h. and torrential rain . Wind gusts up_to 120 m.p.h. whipped Cuba a day after the storm soaked Jamaica . Gale warnings were posted for the east coast of Florida from St . Augustine to the Dry Tortugas .</TEXT>
