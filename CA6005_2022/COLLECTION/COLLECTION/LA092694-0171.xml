   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; CAUTIONARY TALES FROM PANAMA ; FIVE YEARS AFTER THE U.S. INVASION , THE NATION ' S BUMPY RECOVERY OFFERS LESSONS FOR AMERICANS MOVING INTO HAITI . THE FAILURE TO METE OUT JUSTICE IS SEEN AS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO REFORM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his last year in power , Gen . Manuel Antonio Noriega repeatedly appeared to accept a hard-fought deal , brokered with U.S. officials and Panamanian politicians . He would step_down , civilians would be allowed to return to government , this nation ' s long military regime would end . But each time his adversaries thought a deal had been struck , Noriega found a way to renege . Three months after the last talks broke_down , as Noriega continued to cling_to power , U.S. armed forces invaded this tiny country to depose Noriega and restore democratic rule . Five years later , the record in Panama is decidedly mixed and replete with lessons for U.S. military commanders and policy-makers as they move_into Haiti . Although an outright invasion has been avoided , the stated goals are much the same as they were in Panama -- and far more elusive . In today ' s Panama , substantial growth has revived an economy that was left a shambles after the invasion and by earlier U.S.-imposed sanctions . Panamanians enjoy personal and democratic liberties , such_as freedom of expression , unthinkable during the Noriega years . But many of the scourges that then-President George_Bush said he was invading Panama to fight -- drug trafficking , money_laundering and rampant corruption -- continue to flourish . The government that U.S. occupation troops installed left_office in disarray this month , with a single-digit approval rating in public polls . It was replaced -- via Panama ' s most democratic elections ever -- by the same political_party the invasion had ousted , the party that had backed Noriega . Panamanian and U.S. analysts say the shortcomings in Panama can be traced , in part , to a failure to adequately change laws , political and judicial_systems , and institutions , such_as national security_forces . Many Panamanians also lament the failure to mete_out justice to the most abusive of Noriega ' s cronies . Haiti faces similar , if not greater , tasks . Thus far , the United States appears to be backtracking on its earlier resolve to disarm Haiti ' s brutal army and to punish human_rights violators . Where Panama ultimately was rid_of dictator Noriega , the fate of Haiti ' s military strongman , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , is unclear , although he appears to be planning to step_down from power but stay in the country . In another cautionary note for Haiti , Panama ' s lack of democratic tradition meant its post-invasion rulers had scant political training and were largely ineffective . President Guillermo Endara , whose term ended Sept . 1 , never overcame the stigma of having been installed on a U.S. military base by occupation forces . But unlike Endara , Haiti ' s exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- whom the Clinton_Administration has pledged to restore to office -- has a large base of popular support , which will help him build credibility . Still , Haiti ' s road to a functional government is a much longer one than Panama ' s , its army and human_rights history much more chilling . &quot; Removing Noriega did not change the type of society you had in Panama . You can ' t expect that , and you can ' t expect it in Haiti either , &quot; said a senior U.S. military_officer who participated in the Panama invasion . &quot; Panamanians , &quot; the officer added , &quot; expected a lot more_than could have been delivered . They expected Panama would become like the ( U.S.-managed ) Canal Zone -- a city of gold . Trash would be picked_up , there would be jobs , enough to eat . Invasions don ' t solve things like that . What will the Haitians expect ? Who will they blame when it doesn ' t happen ? How do you define improvement there ? &quot; Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere ; Panama has traditionally been one of the most prosperous in Central_America . In contrast to the Haiti intervention , the U.S. invasion of Panama in December , 1989 , ushered into power the Panamanian elite , and foreign investors immediately felt comfortable . It was private commerce , manufacturing and banking -- more_than foreign_aid -- that bolstered Panama ' s economic recovery , an impressive 9.3 % growth in 1991 and about 6 % last year . The goal of improving the administration of justice was a key element to restoring faith and trust in Panama , and it will be in Haiti . Many Panamanians complain that , despite U.S. funding targeted for the judiciary , the post-invasion government did not change laws written under military dictatorship and allowed an unwieldy court system to remain in place . Failure to prosecute human_rights abusers and the possibility of government amnesties -- both real prospects in Haiti too -- thwarted justice for many Panamanians . About 100 Noriega supporters were jailed after the invasion . Many languished in prison for three years or more without trials , and the major atrocities of the previous two decades of military rule went unpunished . A trial was finally held last year in the 1985 beheading of Noriega critic Hugo Spadafora , for example , and the nine soldiers accused of the crime were acquitted . &quot; The people of Panama were thirsty for justice , &quot; said Marco Gandasegui , who heads Panama ' s Latin_American Studies Center . &quot; There were many ( arbitrary conditions ) that characterized the military regime . But ( the Endara government ) did not give the pursuit of justice much importance . In the romantic sense , maybe , but not in the institutional sense. &quot; Members of Noriega ' s former party , the Democratic Revolutionary Party , or PRD , proposed a general amnesty in 1993 . The proposal caused such uproar that the_matter was dropped . But back in power , the party has revived the proposal , and new President Ernesto Perez Balladares last week announced pardons for more_than 200 former Noriega officials , including the head of Noriega ' s secret_police . In Haiti , one of the most arduous tasks that will face the occupation forces -- or the Aristide government , presuming it takes_office -- is the building of a police_force . Some cues can be taken from the Panama experience . Almost immediately after the invasion , Noriega ' s army , the 16 # 000-member Panama Defense Forces , or PDF , was dismantled ; the more notorious military_units , such_as Noriega ' s elite , U.S.-trained , combat-ready Battalion 2000 , were abolished , and a new civilian police_force was formed . But rather than have to contend with thousands of out-of-work soldiers , the Endara government recruited many of the same PDF rank-and-file , as well as some officers , to staff and run the police_force . They had to swear allegiance to Endara and undergo months-long scrutiny that eventually purged nearly 150 captains and majors . Many Panamanians at the time were mortified that the same soldiers who once obeyed Noriega were going_to be street cops . But Endara and his U.S. military advisers argued that there was no other source for the new police . The recruits were given U.S. training , new uniforms and side-arms to replace their heavy weaponry . Still , the new force has been criticized for incompetence and what some critics call an authoritarian swagger . There have been morale problems because of low pay , and many former PDF officers resented their loss of power . The police_force went_through six chiefs in the first 2 1 / 2 years after the invasion . The first was dismissed after revelations that he had a multimillion-dollar bank_account that could not be explained . The second , Col . Eduardo Herrera Hassan , tried to overthrow the Endara government in a 1990 coup that had to be put_down by American troops . Awaiting formal charges , Herrera was among those pardoned last week by Perez Balladares . The current police_chief , Oswaldo Fernandez , is a civilian who has held the job for more_than a year . But U.S. and Panamanian officials say the police are still plagued by corrupt elements , and in a sign of the public ' s continued mistrust , 125 private security firms have sprung_up in the last couple of years , their total manpower greater than the police_force ' s . And they are well-armed . Experts caution that recruiting police from an existing army has different implications in Haiti than in Panama . &quot; The PDF had protected itself , had defended Noriega and had engaged in criminal activity , but it hadn ' t lived_off the suffering of the general population and didn ' t have the history of slaughtering and terrorizing the people the way the Haitian military does , &quot; said Richard Millett , a senior adviser at the University of Miami North-South Center who has written extensively on Panama . &quot; The PDF lived_off international corruption ; the Haitian military thugs live_off domestic corruption. &quot; Millett and others also noted that the PDF was a defeated army , which made_it easier to rein_in . The police here have also seemed ill-equipped to fight a raging crime_wave , and Perez Balladares in his inaugural speech Sept . 1 declared a public_security &quot; state of emergency &quot; and vowed to beef_up the force . Government opponents hope such tough talk will not be used as a pretext for police brutality . To oust Noriega , the United States launched what then was its largest combat operation since the Vietnam_War , deploying 26 # 000 troops before dawn on Dec . 20 , 1989 . Noriega , a onetime CIA operative , escaped and hid for days until his surrender on Jan . 3 , 1990 . In the invasion , 23 Americans and hundreds of Panamanians were killed . After a long federal trial in Miami , Noriega is in prison , serving 40 years for drug trafficking . Endara , whose apparent electoral victory the previous May had been canceled by Noriega , was sworn_in to office in a ceremony at a U.S. military base . Perez Balladares , like many PRD militants , was arrested by U.S. troops and interrogated . When Perez Balladares took_over from Endara this month , Endara actually seemed relieved his presidency was ending . His administration had been dogged by reports of widespread corruption and scandals involving drug trafficking , illegal arms smuggling and other sins that supposedly characterized the Noriega era . Panama ' s secretive banking system and its booming free-trade zone -- one of the largest in the world -- continue to make the isthmus country a thriving center for the laundering of cocaine profits . Although the government took nominal steps to guard against money_laundering , U.S. officials say there is no evidence the business has declined since Noriega ' s departure . Despite economic_growth , 40 % of Panama lives in poverty , and as_many as one in four Panamanians is out_of_work , according to church and private-sector estimates . Drug_abuse has soared , along with street crime , murder and suicide . In a lesson to policy-makers dealing with Haiti , analysts and diplomats assessing post-invasion Panama say that widespread dissatisfaction poses a danger to democratic stability by creating a nostalgia for the &quot; old days &quot; of military rule . In Panama , it has created a yearning for the paternalistic patronage system that benefited many in the working class and the poor . &quot; In the time of dictatorships , there were more jobs for the poor than under democracy , &quot; complained an elderly man playing cards recently in the slum of El Chorrillo , which was burned to the ground during the invasion . He sat on the corner of a concrete slab where Noriega ' s headquarters stood before it was bombed by the invading Americans . That nostalgia may have been the motive for some voters in May 8 presidential elections that gave a narrow but decisive victory to Perez Balladares and the PRD . &quot; The matrix of the Noriega regime has returned to power , only this time they must govern without force , &quot; said Miguel Antonio Bernal , a political_scientist who opposes the government . &quot; The question is , can they govern without force , especially as social and economic_conditions deteriorate ? &quot; Bernal , who has fought military strongmen for most of his adult life , is among the harshest critics of the PRD , and many people do not share his alarm . Perez Balladares and other PRD leaders join in denouncing Noriega and insist the party has reformed . The new president especially has taken great pains to cooperate with Washington , offering to take Cuban refugees and give political asylum to Haitian leader Cedras . Perez Balladares , a banker and millionaire businessman , has also placed prominent independents in his government , such_as Gabriel Lewis Galindo , who helped negotiate the 1977 Panama_Canal treaties . &quot; The ( PRD ' s ) policy of the ' 70s is not the same as the ' 90s , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; The time of confrontation is over. &quot; Still , several members of Perez Balladares ' Cabinet , notably Labor Minister Mitchell Doens and Housing Minister Francisco Sanchez Cardenas , had prominent roles in the Noriega regime . Doens ' record is so questionable that he might have trouble obtaining a U.S. visa if he were not a government official , sources say . While it may_not prove true in Haiti , Panamanian and American analysts caution that , at least in Panama , one legacy of military intervention is that it promotes a dependence on the United States for the resolution of problems . Panamanians have always had a love-hate relationship with the United States , linked to the Panama_Canal and the presence here of the U.S. Southern Command , which oversees all U.S. military operations south of Mexico .
