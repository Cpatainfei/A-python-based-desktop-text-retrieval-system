   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN PAIRS ARE TWO GOOD ; FIGURE_SKATING : GOLD MEDALISTS IN 1988 , EKATERINA GORDEEVA AND SERGEI GRINKOV , WIN AGAIN , WITH ' 92 WINNERS SECOND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pairs figure_skating might never have been performed at a higher level in the Winter_Olympics than it was Tuesday night in the Olympic Amphitheatre , which was one reason it was so difficult to decide who deserved to win . In the first meeting in the Olympics between past champions , eight of the nine judges voted for Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov , the 1988 gold medalists , in the freestyle program , while the crowd preferred Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev , the 1992 gold medalists , rewarding them with a standing_ovation . Because the judges determine the winners , Gordeeva and Grinkov will take gold medals home to Moscow , or perhaps to Tampa , Fla. , where they live when touring in the United States . It was a superb night for other pairs , especially bronze medalists Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada , fourth-place Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov of Russia and fifth-place Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa . But they were amateurs compared to the first two Russian pairs -- literally , because Gordeeva and Grinkov and Mishkutenok and Dmitriev embarked upon lucrative professional careers after winning their gold medals and before returning to the Olympics to challenge one another . Tamara Moskvina , the rambunctious coach who handles Mishkutenok and Dmitriev , predicted the outcome after a practice Tuesday . &quot; I ' m friendly with the judges , but I don ' t think their inclination is toward my couple , &quot; she said . &quot; Some pairs get the marks , others get the renown. &quot; With little argument from the rest of the world , Russians usually get both . They dominated pairs skating in the Soviet_Union when that country dominated the event , winning eight consecutive Winter Olympic championships between 1964 and ' 92 and finishing first and second in five competitions . To find real competition , the Russians have had to look within , splitting into the Moscow and St . Petersburg schools . When Moscow took a 5-4 lead in Olympic gold medals Tuesday night , Moskvina feigned indifference . &quot; We are from St . Petersburg , the capital of intelligence , &quot; she said . She is smart enough to figure_out that this could be the end of pairs superiority for the Russians , whose best figure skaters , now that they have more freedom to choose their disciplines , are deciding -- like the Americans -- to go_into the higher-profile individual competitions . Six years , and one infant daughter , since they won in 1988 at Calgary , Canada , Gordeeva , 22 , and Grinkov , 27 , have seen the future and decided they are not part of it . Gordeeva said the Russians will always be strong , but she added that they will have to look over their shoulders at the Canadians and the Americans . She could be right in the case of Meno and Sand , whose coach , John Nicks , said : &quot; I think this is a pair on the upward rise . They haven ' t been together that long. &quot; In 1993 , their first full season together , they finished fifth in the world . Their competition last year did not include Gordeeva and Grinkov or Mishkutenok and Dmitriev . If not for the rule allowing professionals to return , Meno and Sand might have won bronze medals in these Games . Nicks might have found joy in that , but as the United States ' most successful pairs coach , he seemed enthused about the return of the Russians . He prefers Gordeeva and Grinkov , but he believed that the perfect score of 6.0 that the Russian judge gave them for artistic impression was overdoing it . Nicks would not have argued if Mishkutenok and Dmitriev had won . &quot; Gordeeva and Grinkov are what I would call a purist ' s pair , &quot; he said . &quot; But those who prefer imaginative choreography , gimmicks and new ideas , they prefer the second Russians. &quot; In general , Nicks said , the skating was wonderful . An exception was the nasty spill taken by Germany ' s Mandy Woetzel amid a relatively easy set of spirals , forcing her and partner Ingo Steuer to retire . She was taken_to a hospital , where she required three stitches in her chin .</TEXT>
