   <TEXT> When Christine Clarke drapes a clerical stole across both shoulders , becoming one of the Church_of_England ' s first woman priests , she will fulfill a calling she has felt_for 22 years . &quot; It ' s been a long wait , but now there is a sense of everything coming_together , &quot; said Clarke , 48 . &quot; There is a feeling that for this I was born . Now we are walking right into the central structure of the church. &quot; After years of spiritual torment and theological wrangling , women are being admitted to the priesthood for the first time since King Henry_VIII created the Church_of_England in the 16th Century . The state church ' s 1 # 200 woman deacons and their supporters are expected to pack Bristol Cathedral today for the ordination of 33 women by Bishop Barry Rogerson . &quot; It is going_to be a very joyous occasion , a full_house , &quot; said the Rev . Paul Denyer , communications officer of the Bristol Diocese . &quot; It ' s marvelous to have been able to put ourselves out of business , &quot; said Caroline Davis , director of the Movement for the Ordination of Women , which was formed 15 years ago . The church ' s spiritual_leader , Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey , has been a strong supporter of ordaining women , but the issue has tested the church ' s traditional toleration of diversity . * &quot; It is the humanity of Christ which is important , not his maleness , &quot; Carey argued before the ordination of women was approved by the General Synod in November , 1992 . In making the change , the Church_of_England joined 12 of the 28 self-governing provinces of the worldwide Anglican_Communion . There are 1 # 381 women serving as Anglican priests , including 1 # 031 in the U.S. Episcopal Church , according to the Anglican Consultative Council . The Episcopal Church has ordained women since 1976 , and in 1989 consecrated the first woman bishop . Now Clarke and the others will be able to bless the bread and wine at Holy_Communion , pronounce absolution and the forgiveness of sin , and give blessings -- priestly duties previously forbidden to them . They will be allowed to wear their clerical stoles &quot; priest-wise , &quot; or across both shoulders , instead of &quot; deacon-wise , &quot; over just one . Clarke , a deacon in Bristol , said she has encountered little opposition to her ordination , &quot; but I cannot forget that others in the church are hurting over this. &quot; Jan Fortune-Wood , 32 , who has three children , holds a doctorate in theology and has been a deacon for five years , has &quot; felt called to the priesthood from childhood. &quot; She said ordination will &quot; remove that hollow center &quot; in her ministry : the inability to celebrate Communion . She also reported little opposition at her parish church , St . Andrew ' s in Swindon , Bristol Diocese , where she is a counselor to single parents and the elderly . &quot; Two elderly ladies left early on , but everyone else is supportive , &quot; she said . * Since the governing General Synod voted , 35 Anglican clergymen and several hundred lay people have quit the Church_of_England in protest , said church spokesman Steve Jenkins . Many joined the Roman_Catholic_Church , which does not permit women to be priests . Last month , the Anglo-Catholic traditionalist group , Forward in Faith , released a statement signed by eight serving or retired bishops and 712 priests and deacons indicating they intended to forsake the church to become Roman_Catholics . &quot; This is a matter of great sadness , &quot; said Margaret Brown , co-founder of Women Against the Ordination of Women . &quot; We are not just a_few cranks . Votes_in various synods have shown at least one-third of the church opposes women ' s ordination. &quot; The Rev . Malcolm Widdecombe of Bristol , a prominent dissenter , believes the church &quot; is moving_into error. &quot; &quot; This is against the tradition of the church and the teaching of Scripture , &quot; he said . &quot; Our Lord gave an honored position to women , but he chose men for the major tasks. &quot; Widdecombe believes ordaining women will be disastrous for church membership , which already is sparse . In a country of 55 million people , about 6.7 million belong_to Christian_churches , according to the United Kingdom Christian Handbook . The Church_of_England claimed 1.47 million , down 21 % since 1975 . In an effort to accommodate dissenters , the General Synod put several limitations on woman priests . They may_not become bishops , a parish may refuse to accept a woman as its priest , and bishops now in office cannot be compelled to ordain women or accept them as priests in their dioceses . The synod also approved special severance pay arrangements , which became effective Feb . 22 , for full-time priests who decide in the next 10 years to resign rather than accept women as colleagues . In November , 1993 , the General Synod -- consisting_of laity , clergy and bishops -- prohibited discrimination against opponents of woman priests . It also permitted dioceses , with bishops presiding , to make their own rules on acceptance of female priests . Parishioners may change to dioceses whose bishops have acceptable views on women ' s ordination , and two &quot; flying bishops &quot; have been appointed to serve traditionalists throughout the country . Despite all this , Brown said , in some cases &quot; there is pressure on dissenters ( among the clergy ) to toe_the_line . Hints are given that they might not be promoted. &quot; Widdecombe says he will continue at his church , St . Philip and St . Jacob , &quot; because my parishioners are very supportive and we have something good going. &quot; He reported receiving inquiries from dissenters in other parishes about joining his flock of 200 . Canon John Simpson of Bristol cathedral said the first ordination service for women will be the same as for men , with &quot; a_few changes , such_as using more inclusive language -- changing ' he ' to ' she ' -- and some small alterations to the prayers on ministry. &quot;</TEXT>
