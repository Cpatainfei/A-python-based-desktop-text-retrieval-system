   <TEXT> Rules for dinosaur hunting : 1 ) Bring plenty of irradiated chocolate_milk boxes . 2 ) Remember to bring the guidebook . 3 ) Don ' t forget the sunscreen , hats , first-aid_kit and the_like . 4 ) More chocolate_milk . 5 ) Brownies are better than trail mix . Especially if you don ' t bring enough chocolate_milk . This list may save you from being tied to an anthill and left to your fate , an end I barely escaped on a recent outing inspired by the &quot; Dinosaur Hunter ' s Kit &quot; ( Running Press : $ 17.95 ) because I forgot Nos . 2 and 4 from the list above . At about a half-mile into a hike on the Eaton Canyon nature trail in Altadena on a very warm Saturday afternoon , my hearty band of dino hunters were tired_of the heat , tired_of the dust and really tired_of their cheerleading idiot guide ( who had promised a cold stream and perhaps even a waterfall , not to mention deer , bears , Fred Flintstone , John Wayne searching for Natalie Wood , and so on ) telling them the best stuff was just around the bend . In short , I had a rebellion on my hands , so I gathered the troops at a shady spot and passed_out the first and last round of chocolate_milk . And reached for the &quot; Dinosaur Hunter ' s Handbook. &quot; Which wasn ' t there , having been left in the car , forgotten in a flurry of last-minute booger jokes and karate kicks -- &quot; Just practicing for class , Mr. Zimmerman &quot; -- to my shins . So I winged it as best I could , dredging_up what I could remember from the book and supplementing it with bits and pieces of ancient biology texts and late-night movies to enlighten , entertain and educate ( well , maybe one out of three ) my young charges , who were quickly refreshed by the shade and sugared milk and happy to make_fun of my stories and ideas . More important , they were ready to venture forth , and in another quarter-mile we found a stream to splash_around in and build a dam in . The long day ' s journey was salvaged ( the forgotten round of chocolate_milk replaced with a stop at In ' n ' Out Burger for sodas and fries on the way home ) but the mission was far from accomplished . The little handbook was definitely missed ; the chapters on what paleontologists do , how dinosaurs get their names and a mock fossil hunter ' s notebook convey a fair amount of useful information in 64 small pages . It was getting late and I had kids to deliver , so I saved the &quot; kit &quot; part for later in the week , when my son would have time to dig_up his own apatosaurus . The kit , in fact , is a &quot; replica of an apatosaurus skeleton buried in hard , slate-like layers and covered with clay-like rock similar to the soft rocks where real fossils are found. &quot; It comes_with a &quot; wooden spatula &quot; ( actually a Popsicle stick ) to scrape away the rock ( actually hard clay ) ; you ' ll also need water , paper_towels , a toothbrush and the_like . The last chapter in the guidebook contained the detailed instructions we needed to get us through our &quot; dig , &quot; which turned_out remarkably well considering that I ' m all thumbs and tend to break models into many pieces . The instructions include space for drawing and writing_about the work by the young dino hunter , including tips for adult &quot; lab assistants. &quot; Like the real_thing , our fossil dig was agreeably messy and lots of fun . It kept us occupied for some hours spread_out over a_few days -- digging the fossil , baking it dry in the oven , gluing the pieces together , painting it and so on , all_the while keeping a log_in the back of the handbook . And we have a nice-sized ball of clay hardening on the patio for a bonus . * &quot; Be Your Own Map Expert &quot; by Barbara Taylor ( Sterling Publishing : $ 12.95 ) would have been useful on our wilderness venture and is an excellent activity book in its own_right . Pretty near everything about maps and map-making is covered with superb graphics and well-written information . The activities range from designing map symbols to creating a treasure_hunt game . My schoolmarm wife took one look and in short order made plans for a week ' s worth of lessons for next semester .</TEXT>
