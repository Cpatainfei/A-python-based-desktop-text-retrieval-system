   <HEADLINE> EX-N.Y. POST SUITOR HOFFENBERG ARRESTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steven Hoffenberg , the former head of scandal-ridden Towers Financial Corp . and once a suitor for the New York Post newspaper , was arrested Thursday and charged with securities fraud and obstruction of justice . The criminal charges relate to a civil suit filed last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission that accused Hoffenberg and Towers , now in bankruptcy , of using false financial_statements to sell more_than $ 400 million in securities . Securities regulators consider the criminal case a key move toward stopping the flamboyant debt collector from continuing to operate or open new businesses . Hoffenberg , 48 , was expected to be released on a $ 1-million bond Thursday evening . The pending SEC civil suit accuses him of cheating 2 # 800 investors in 40 states , but authorities said Hoffenberg is still in business , with two new companies in New York : Stratford Credit Corp . and Haley Capital Corp . Hoffenberg is charged with one count of criminal securities fraud and one count of obstruction of justice . If convicted , he could be sentenced to as_many as 15 years in prison and fined up_to $ 500 # 000 . Towers bought unpaid medical accounts and tried to collect them . Two of its subsidiaries have also been targets of legal_actions in New Jersey and California for improperly holding debts . Just last month , the bankruptcy trustee overseeing Towers proceedings said in a lawsuit that he had found evidence of theft and squandering of more_than $ 400 million . That suit seeks treble damages of $ 1.2 billion .</TEXT>
