   <HEADLINE> O.C. ART ; AN ESSENTIALLY HOLLOW ' GESTURE ' IN SCULPTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The idea of a show specifically about fragmentaryhuman forms in modern and postmodern sculpture sounded intriguing . After all , many artists have devised their own visual synecdoche for the human figure , replacing the whole by the part to heighten or emphasize certain emotional , kinesthetic or formal qualities . Indeed , the roster of American and European artists in &quot; The Essential Gesture &quot; at the Newport Harbor Art Museum ( through Dec . 31 ) is hard to fault in terms of quality . But the show itself is disappointing . Instead of finding fresh ways to explore artists ' attitudes toward the body , chief curator Bruce Guenther has opted for a rote art history_lesson . The exhibition not only lacks a sense of the relationships among pieces made at different times by different artists , but gives little sense of why the incomplete figure has been such a satisfactory solution for so many . The real pity is that the same works could have had a more fruitful dialogue with one another in an installation ( and accompanying essay ) that abandoned the rigid classifications of art_movements for a fresher look_at how the art engages such themes as vulnerability , power , allure and implied movement . The show begins with Auguste Rodin ' s &quot; Walking Man , &quot; a larger-than-life bronze torso and striding legs dating_from the late 19th Century . The artist ' s stature and the sheer power of the piece helped legitimize the use of incomplete figures in modern sculpture . The continuing fascination of &quot; Walking Man &quot; stems from its concentrated evocation of forward movement , a decisive shifting of weight from leg to leg . Given this overriding theme , arms and a head would be superfluous . Another curator might have juxtaposed the Rodin with , say , Joel Shapiro ' s &quot; Untitled ( JS 768 ) &quot; from 1987 , shown elsewhere in the exhibition . The small bronze is composed of four smooth rectangular bars representing a head , torso and legs . By virtue of deft angling , the figure stands on one leg . Lacking arms , the piece exquisitely emphasizes the tenuousness of balance . In this exhibition , however , the Rodin is juxtaposed with two Giacometti sculptures of attenuated women , Gaston Lachaise ' s daintily gesticulating female torso with the swelling breast-buttocks of a fertility amulet and Picasso ' s flattened , tactile image of a single arm . To be sure , these artists -- as well as Constantin Brancusi , Hans Belmer , Jean Arp and others -- made a decisive break_with holistic or normative ideas of what a figure sculpture could be . But this is not news . * Why not show the ultra-vulnerable Giacometti women next to Kiki Smith ' s extraordinary and shockingly fragile paper sculpture of a dead_body ? Drained of its organs and vital juices , it dangles above its cast-off head and arms , heaped on the floor like pathetically useless armor . Why not let the Lachaise &quot; Torso With Arms Raised &quot; resonate with Louise Bourgeois ' painfully exposed , cruelly dangling female torso , &quot; Janus Fleuri &quot; ? Why not discuss the different ways male and female artists have condensed and exaggerated the female form ? As it is , the essay and wall texts offer only basic information about the individual works , art_movements and traditional sculptural materials -- information more appropriate to an art history survey than to an exhibition attempting to break new ground . Other neglected opportunities include discussions of the psychological effects and art historical lineage of specific gestures , and the ramifications of works ( by Smith , Peter Shelton and Judith Shea , in this show ) that deal specifically with the body as a container . Instead of representing 22 artists with 33 pieces , the show might have gained breadth by winnowing out a_few of the multiple works by one sculptor ( was it necessary to have two Giacomettis ? ) and including more artists working in non-traditional media . Additionally , several works -- such_as Willem de Kooning ' s &quot; Seated Woman on a Bench , &quot; Oliver Lee Jackson ' s &quot; Untitled &quot; and Antony Gormley ' s &quot; Word Made Flesh &quot; -- seem rather too &quot; whole &quot; to fit comfortably within the show ' s theme . Despite the stature of the artists and the quality of the art -- reason enough for many viewers to visit -- &quot; The Essential Gesture &quot; seems a discouragingly hollow curatorial gesture . * &quot; The Essential Gesture &quot; continues through Dec . 31 at the Newport Harbor Art Museum , 850 San Clemente Drive , Newport Beach , 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday . $ 4 for adults , $ 2 for students and seniors ; free on Tuesdays .
