   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA ' S ELECTIONS ; PROPOSITIONS ; 191 : RENAMES JUSTICE COURTS ; WHAT IT IS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Proposition 191 would convert the state ' s 47 Justice Courts , which operate in the smaller_towns of rural counties , to Municipal Courts . All Justice Court judges would become Municipal Court judges . Both the Justice and Municipal Courts hear criminal cases involving less serious misdemeanors and civil cases involving disputes of $ 25 # 000 or less . The only difference is that Justice Courts serve districts of 40 # 000 people or less ; Municipal Court districts have more_than 40 # 000 residents . A name change , from Justice Court to Municipal Court , would have no impact on the work Justice Court judges are doing -- since , under Proposition 91 , Justice Court judges and Municipal Court judges already are doing the same work -- and the salary is the same : $ 95 # 214 annually . ARGUMENTS FOR Proposition 191 would finish a job that California voters began in the 1988 elections , that of &quot; professionalizing and equalizing the administration of justice &quot; in the state ' s rural outposts such_as Alpine , Inyo , Lassen , Mono and Tuolumne counties . In 1988 , voters approved Proposition 91 , which increased the authority and prestige of Justice Court judges . It required that Justice Court judges have a minimum of five years experience as a lawyer -- the same as Municipal Court judges -- and barred the practice_of_law on the side . It also authorized Justice Court judges to travel throughout the state to hear cases in counties whose courts were short-staffed . &quot; ( Proposition ) 191 is long overdue , &quot; said Mariposa County Justice Court Judge Carlos C . LaRoche . The Justice Court label , he said , is &quot; an anachronism &quot; left over from California ' s frontier days . ARGUMENTS AGAINST The only formal opposition to Proposition 191 has come from Gary B . Wesley , a San Jose attorney who often submits contrary ballot arguments when no one else will . If the Justice Courts are to be eliminated , Wesley said , those judges ought to have to apply for the Municipal Court . &quot; Perhaps , &quot; he said in the ballot pamphlet , &quot; they will not be needed or sufficiently qualified. &quot; WHO SUPPORTS IT The state Assembly , 79 to ; state Senate , 39 to ; California Judges Assn .
