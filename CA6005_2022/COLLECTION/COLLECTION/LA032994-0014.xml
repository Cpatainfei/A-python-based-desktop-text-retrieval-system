   <HEADLINE> A TSUNAMI OF JOBLESSNESS ON THE HORIZON ; GLOBAL STABILITY : INDUSTRIAL NATIONS MUST ATTEND TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD ' S EXPLOSIVE RATES OF UNEMPLOPYMENT AND POPULATION GROWTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concern about unemployment drew the finance_ministers of Europe , Japan and the United States to the recent summit in Detroit , but who spoke_for the rest of the world ? Unemployment_rates in the industrialized countries are at the highest levels since the Great Depression -- 6.5 % in the United States and 12 % in Western Europe . But unemployment_rates in much of the developing world already average 40 % to 50 % . And that does not take_into_account the greater number of men and women who are &quot; underemployed , &quot; working long hours for pennies . Without major new efforts by both developed and developing countries , the problem will not be resolved . Burdened by debt and a rapidly expanding population , economic_growth in the developing countries still remains below 1970s ' levels . These countries are also adversely effected by the slow growth in industrial countries , which still account_for three-fourths of the total world output . Work-force growth remains a key element of future employment patterns around the world . Workers in industrialized countries are aging and retiring from the ranks of the employed without an equal surge of &quot; new blood &quot; coming_in from below . The developing world has the opposite problem . In the decades ahead , about 95 % of the world ' s population growth will be in the developing countries of Africa , Asia and Latin_America . These countries will account_for virtually all_of the new entrants into the world labor_force over the next 25 years . To meet this surge , these countries will need to increase employment by more_than 2 % a year for the foreseeable future just to prevent unemployment_rates from rising beyond today ' s critical level . The United States should be concerned about employment in the developing world for its own interests . Economic growth in the developing world means jobs in this country . As developing-country income rises , so does the demand for U.S. goods . Proper policies by the United States and the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin_America could stimulate U.S. export growth by more_than 10 % a year , creating as_many as 1.7 million new U.S. jobs by the end of the decade . As President Clinton has recognized , jobs bring more_than just income to individuals . High unemployment wreaks havoc on society , particularly on families . It ranks as one of the fundamental causes of political unrest , particularly in newly emerging democracies , where people expect to reap the economic benefits of free elections . Jobs also help the environment because they allow people to earn a living without over-cultivating fragile lands or cutting_down forests just to stay alive . Over the longer_run , development of decent jobs will help to cut_down on immigration . whether from the developing world , Eastern Europe or the former Soviet_Union . Policy-makers may be tempted to ignore this &quot; other &quot; employment crisis . The feeling persists that we have enough to worry about and should focus_on domestic problems . But ignoring developing-world problems will not make them go_away . Immigration , conflict and political unrest , as well as threats to democracy , will only increase , as will the costs of preventing spillovers into the industrial world . There are several opportunities on deck for the Clinton_Administration and other leaders to create strategies for global economic integration and growth that will benefit rich and poor countries . The World Population Conference meets in Cairo this September and will highlight the need for new approaches to slowing population ( and therefore work-force ) growth . Next March , world leaders will assemble in Copenhagen for a summit on social development . Finally , employment throughout the world could be increased by the next round of trade liberalization negotiations . In an increasingly global economy , interdependence is the key to success ; the Clinton_Administration recognized this when it remained_firm on NAFTA and GATT . It is obvious that economic_growth in this country and others will depend_on similar , outward-looking strategies .</TEXT>
