   <HEADLINE> RELIGION , JUSTICE SLIP OUT OF BALANCE ; LAW : COURT ' S CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISM PUTS LANDLORDS ' BELIEFS AHEAD OF RENTERS ' RIGHTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Judicial_activism , whether liberal or conservative , is troublesome not so_much because it is arrogant but because it appears so rational to the activists . But one man ' s reasoning may be another man ' s Wonderland . A tendency toward conservative activism has been brewing for nearly a decade in the California courts ; in May , it boiled_over in a landmark landlord-rights decision from the Court of Appeal , which the state Supreme Court has agreed to review . The case is one of several being brought by strict Christian landlords across the country , challenging laws that protect against housing discrimination based on marital_status . In holding for the landlord , the appellate_court accepted religious conviction as a trump over valid laws . If the decision is upheld , it could fundamentally alter the balance between law and religion , for it would serve as precedent for holding personal religious_belief higher than obedience to the law . The court ' s opinion also will be a test of whether politically conservative judges mean it when they say that their function is to give effect to the Legislature ' s will . The case involves the owner of rental property in Chico who says that because she believes that sex outside marriage is a sin , she should not have to rent to unmarried couples , thus , in the court ' s words , &quot; facilitating the sin of fornication. &quot; On the surface , this seems to make_sense . Religious liberty is one of our most cherished rights . But the Court of Appeal failed to address a threshold question : Since when is renting apartments the exercise of religion ? By failing to take_up such an obvious and obviously important question , the court demonstrates that it is interested in result , not reasoning -- the definition of judicial_activism . No court has ever explained what , if any , limits can be placed on the exercise of religion , but the U.S. and California Supreme Courts have always been clear that while religious_belief is constitutionally protected , as are common religious practices such_as going_to church , religion-based conduct that moves_into the secular world is not . By uncritically accepting the premise that apartment renting constitutes an exercise of religion , the court mocks the notion that there is a secular world anywhere and turns civil_law into little more_than an option for religious believers . Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has clearly noted the way such a rule could be abused : Letting the civil_law give_way too easily to the beliefs of religious adherents would effectively grant believers &quot; a private right to ignore generally applicable laws , &quot; one that has no discernible limiting principle . The problem is the subjective nature of belief . There are no objective criteria to determine what an individual believes , so as a practical matter , courts must accept virtually any assertion of belief without further inquiry . Viewed superficially , the California appellate decision is a tit-for-tat response to liberal activism , allowing religious conservatives to thumb their nose at the law the way liberals supposedly have_on such issues as the death_penalty . But the great irony of the free-exercise exemption is that it opens the door for claims based on liberal as well as conservative religious_beliefs . Any observer of human behavior can see the attraction in a rule permitting people to exempt themselves from the law based on their subjective beliefs . People generally do not like having to obey the obligations that law imposes ; that ' s why we have laws in the first place . The public good is much easier to stomach if only other people have to give something up_to make_it happen . But there will be few &quot; other people &quot; if personal belief entitles anyone to claim an exemption from disagreeable laws . When religiously motivated conduct moves outside the confines of religious_ritual , ceremony or practice , and specifically when it moves_into the commercial marketplace , the rules of secular order must be taken_into_account . As the U.S. Supreme Court has long explained , this does not minimize the importance of religious_belief in our pluralistic society , it just strikes a necessary balance between religious_belief and the obligations of citizenship . By allowing the term &quot; free exercise of religion &quot; to mean any action by a believer , no matter how far removed from religious practice , the Court of Appeal took a large step toward making the obligations of citizenship illusory and reduced the Legislature to little more_than a debating society . That was the fear of those who decried liberal judicial activists . It has no less force now .</TEXT>
