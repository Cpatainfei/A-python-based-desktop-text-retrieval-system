   <HEADLINE> OUSTED RWANDA LEADERSHIP DISPLAYS BRAVADO IN ZAIRE ; AFRICA : EX-INFORMATION CHIEF SAYS HUTU CABINET , MILITARY ARE REORGANIZING . NO SERIOUS THREAT IS SEEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rwanda ' s ousted Hutu government has regrouped here on the Zairian border and is feebly rattling its rusty bloodstained saber . Even as more Rwandans continue to file_out of their country into semi-permanent refugee camps in Zaire , their shadowy , besieged , seldom-seen president and Cabinet are meeting and aspiring to a comeback . Maybe soon . Maybe in 30 years . Who can know ? &quot; It is a good thing the population has come_along with the government . These people right now need to look_after their own welfare . But , meanwhile , the government and the military are reorganizing , &quot; said Eliezer Niyitegeka , minister of information in the defeated government . Perhaps the new Tutsi-led army that has taken_over Rwanda can be pressured to negotiate power-sharing with the old government , Niyitegeka said . If that is unlikely , he added , &quot; we will prepare to go_back by force , by violence. &quot; In the short run , Niyitegeka ' s threats seem no more_than weak bluster . The army of his deposed government was routed in its short , sharp civil_war with the Rwandan Patriotic Front , or RPF . Few take seriously the boast of a sudden resumption of fighting . Moreover , the old government is indelibly stained by blood . An estimated 500 # 000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slain in a_few short weeks beginning April 6 . On that day , the nation ' s Hutu president was killed after a mysterious rocket blew his plane from the sky over the capital , Kigali . The hard-line replacement government , which includes Niyitegeka and President Theodor Sindikubwabo , was sworn_in April 9 . And the massacres raged on for weeks . But over the long_run , this old government still maintains vast control and influence over Rwanda ' s Hutu majority -- with more_than 1 million of them now encamped in Zaire . It is no exaggeration to call this a government-in-exile of a people-in-exile . The bitter post-colonial history of Rwanda also adds credibility to the old government ' s threats . After all , many of the Tutsi soldiers who now control Rwanda were born in refugee camps in Uganda a generation ago , the result of the same ethnic strife that sent today ' s Hutus fleeing . Border refugee camps in this Central African region are nothing if not caldrons of hatred , boot camps for revenge . In a long interview Monday with The Times and the London Daily Telegraph , Niyitegeka talked_about the prospects for reconciliation , the massacres and the Hutu view of justice . Now a refugee , he struck a temperate and controlled tone . It was a presentation at_odds with the countervailing image of his government in power : a regime that tolerated , even encouraged , the butchering of Tutsis in retribution for the death of the Hutu president . &quot; As a member of the Cabinet at the time when this occurred , I accept collective responsibility , &quot; he said . &quot; But not just the government is responsible . Every man is responsible -- even you . You didn ' t come_to save these people. &quot; Niyitegeka insisted that his record in Kigali was of a peacemaker , that as information minister he urged the massacres be stopped . But Alixon DesForges , a Washington-based consultant to Human_Rights Watch / Africa , an international monitoring group , said , &quot; Numerous witnesses have reported that Niyitegeka was involved at a high level in planning and organizing the ( Tutsi ) massacre. &quot; As for the information minister , he observed : &quot; You ask , who committed the massacres ? Every individual is responsible_for his own actions , good or bad . If any member of the government is responsible_for any reprehensible act , he will have to answer . But you cannot generalize and say the whole government is responsible_for what happened . . . . If a British citizen kills someone , do you say that all British are killers ? . . . It was as if evil forces rose_up to cause this calamity. &quot; Still , he voiced the argument that has become standard fare in refugee conversation : &quot; You cannot reconcile two peoples if only one of them is judged guilty . It ' s a matter of justice . What about Tutsis who killed Hutus ? There has to be some kind of general amnesty for everybody . You have to forgive one another. &quot; For its part , the RPF army and its new civilian government are bent_on punishment for the slaughter . Some officials have said the list of guilty could be as long as 30 # 000 . The new government has said it will defer to an international war_crimes investigation . On other subjects , Niyitegeka said : * Yes , the old government fled with the national treasury . &quot; The government could not leave the money in Kigali , for the RPF are just robbers . . . . We didn ' t take it to spend it , but to protect it. &quot; * He recognized that the presence of a shadow government , plotting its comeback , poses a dilemma for host nation Zaire . Publicly , Zaire has asked the United Nations to find another nation that will grant the Rwandan government amnesty . &quot; But I don ' t see how they can force us to go_to another country . We are human_beings first . We are refugees. &quot; Niyitegeka said the old government is not concerned about an internal challenge to its authority . Times staff writer Robert L . Jackson in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
