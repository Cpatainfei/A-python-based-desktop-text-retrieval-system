   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; ZEDILLO REVEALS BOLD PRESIDENTIAL STYLE ; MEXICO : ANALYSTS GIVE HIGH MARKS TO NEW LEADER AFTER HE UNCEREMONIOUSLY FIRES HIS TREASURY_SECRETARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo unveiled his young Cabinet a month ago today , Treasury_Secretary Jaime Serra Puche was seen as the cornerstone of stability in a dream team of economists and technocrats who would carry Mexico ' s gradual free-market revolution into the next century . On Thursday , amid Mexico ' s worst economic_crisis in more_than a decade , Zedillo unceremoniously fired him , announcing on national radio that he was accepting the resignation of the only Cabinet holdover -- other_than Zedillo himself -- from the administration of his predecessor , Carlos Salinas de Gortari . In a single , bold act , Zedillo has done more_than just clear the halls of power of the last of Salinas ' top aides and remove a key professional who was the darling of Wall_Street and Mexico ' s chief negotiator of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . In allowing Serra -- who analysts now say apparently knew more about international trade than banking and currency markets -- to fall on the sword for a bitter devaluation that has thrown the Mexican economy into chaos , Zedillo also put the first bold strokes on the signature of his presidential style . As the dust began to settle Friday just in time for Zedillo ' s one-month anniversary in office , several Mexican political analysts actually gave high marks to the bookish and shy president for his early demonstration of guile within the grilla , the Mexican equivalent of &quot; inside the Beltway. &quot; The president , whose lack of political experience had dogged him during his campaign and after , had acted decisively -- if not swiftly -- to isolate the cause of what he declared a national &quot; economic emergency , &quot; to fix blame and to replace Serra with another Cabinet technocrat who is highly respected internationally : Guillermo Ortiz , the Stanford-educated former secretary of communications and transport . Mexico ' s markets did not react with immediate favor when they opened Friday morning . In light trading , the peso fell five centavos against the dollar , at 4.925 pesos from Thursday ' s close of 4.875. But economists and market_analysts said they were encouraged by leaks from the president ' s office Friday of a bailout plan that Zedillo is expected to unveil in an address to the nation Monday night . Top aides said the government is negotiating an assistance package totaling between $ 10 billion and $ 13 billion with two major commercial_banks , Citibank and J.P. Morgan Inc. In his address , Zedillo is also expected to offer a bond scheme to encourage investors to hang onto key government_securities called tesobonos . About $ 10 billion worth of the bonds come due in the first_quarter of next year , which could cause another run_on Mexico ' s sharply declined reserves . * There were also encouraging signs Friday on the political front . The rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army uprising in the southern state of Chiapas , which Zedillo and others had blamed for triggering the economic_crisis , had moved off the front burner . Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos issued a communique late Friday from his rain-forest stronghold declaring a unilateral cease-fire from New Year ' s Day through Friday . During that period , he said his fighters will take no offensive action against government forces , blockade no roads and redeploy far enough from Mexican army positions to ensure peace until negotiations can start anew . Marcos ' latest communique reinforced his earlier order withdrawing his armed fighters from positions they had taken outside dozens of villages during a one-day insurrection on Dec . 19 . Marcos &quot; saluted &quot; Zedillo ' s decision to similarly redeploy Mexican army troops away from the rebel zone . The communique defused immediate fears of a repeat of the Zapatistas ' 1994 New Year ' s Day shooting war , which left at least 145 people dead . But some Mexican analysts were unforgiving , criticizing Zedillo for acting too slowly or for deepening the nation ' s political instability with a Cabinet shake-up so early in his six-year term . Others contemplated conspiracy theories focusing_on the simple fact that Serra was considered the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ' s leading candidate to replace Zedillo as president in the year 2000 . Most analysts agreed that Zedillo ' s biggest test will come Monday night , when he is scheduled to explain how he will end the current economic nightmare and stop a seemingly inevitable ballooning of inflation , which the president ' s aides believe they can manage by the second_half of next year . While encouraged by Zedillo ' s moves Thursday and Friday , Morgan Stanley Vice_President Rafael Bello said , the president &quot; will have to show that he is in control , that he has a handle on the situation and that he is ready to move forward. &quot; Clearly , that will be a monolithic task . Despite a late-week rally , the Mexican currency lost 40 % of its value in two weeks . Most of Mexico ' s banks , already overextended with bad loans 4.5 times larger than American banks , are considered in critical condition . Tens of thousands of small- and medium-sized Mexican businesses faced potential disaster after interest_rates on short-term borrowing were doubled Wednesday in an effort to keep some foreign capital coming_in .</TEXT>
