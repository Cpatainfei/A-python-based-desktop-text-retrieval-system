   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA ; FIX AMERICA ' S CHINATOWNS FIRST ; THE U.S. SHOULD EXAMINE ITS OWN HUMAN-RIGHTS RECORD BEFORE WIELDING IT AS A WEAPON IN DETERMINING TRADE STATUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> San Francisco is fast becoming the first large America city with an Asian majority . Its 35 % Asian population by the end of the decade will exceed 50 % . In the heart of San Francisco , on Vallejo Street , are three-story wooden-frame buildings occupied by elderly Americans of Chinese descent whose human_rights are being violated every day . The fragile , elderly poor are packed into &quot; standing_room only &quot; rooms , with a bed , bureau and a pole for hanging laundry . The tenants spend nearly all their income on rent . They have minimal health service . They fear leaving the buildings because of constant and unmerciful street crime . These people have unfulfilled human_rights . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , a Californian , says that China will not have most-favored-nation status extended this summer until &quot; it provides concrete assurances &quot; in a number of human-rights areas . The Clinton_Administration thinks it knows how 1.2 billion Chinese people should arrange themselves as a nation-state . They feel it is a moral imperative to hurt China if it doesn ' t embrace today ' s values of our 250-year-old republic . If you want to sell to us , you must meet our moral standards . These arguments are reminiscent_of the late 19th-Century traders from Western Europe and the United States who thought it was their right to force open the ports of China for their goods , which in those days included Indian poppies . Today , China is being forced to accept the new opium of misplaced values that has resulted in a society torn by guns , gangs and graffiti . Which moral standards should China emulate ? Those that the California Legislature passed long ago as the Chinese Exclusion Act ? Those that jailed our California citizens of Japanese descent during the war and confiscated their farms and homes ? Those that allowed California miners to slaughter Asian railroad workers solely because they were beginning to prosper ? And what do we say to their descendants who were discriminated against in the admission policies of the University of California ? Are they the standards of the San Francisco school_board that long ago forbade Asian students to sit in a classroom with Europeans or the same school_system that 50 years later denied credit to the Chinese students unless they attended public_schools instead of successful Chinese schools ? How would Americans have felt in the 1940s if China had set as a condition of being our ally in World_War_II that America had to desegregate the South , give equal_opportunity to blacks and integrate the armed forces ? How would the United States have responded in the ' 60s if China had placed as a condition for better relations that Martin_Luther_King be released from the Birmingham jail ? Premier Li Peng , meeting with Secretary Christopher , said , &quot; China and the United States have different concepts regarding human rights. &quot; He said that the progress expected from a developed country will be different from that of a developing country . Western values place the individual as the keystone of society . Asian societies place the general welfare of its members above that of the individual . Malaysia ' s Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohamed put it succinctly when he said that it seems that America liberates the individual while imprisoning society . American values have failed in their eyes , so why insist on imposing them on others ? Well , has China done anything positive lately ? It affirmed its support for the Universal Declaration of Human_Rights ; opened talks with the International Committee of the Red_Cross to allow access to Chinese prisons ; gave the State_Department an accounting of 235 prisoners ; helped in ending the war in Cambodia ; signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and , so far , has not obstructed the United States in its U.N. efforts to bring some rational behavior from North_Korea . Instead of the Administration trying to change China , how about just Chinatown ? Defend the human_rights of the elderly on Vallejo Street by ensuring them a decent place to live , freedom from physical harm and an education system in which their grandchildren learn how to prosper rather than being shot dead by drug-numbed 15-year-olds . We need to be very careful -- China may insist that we observe human_rights for our own people or they won ' t trade with us .</TEXT>
