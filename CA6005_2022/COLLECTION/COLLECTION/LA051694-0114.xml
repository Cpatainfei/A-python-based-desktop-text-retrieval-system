   <TEXT> RACING THE ELECTORAL CLOCK : Democratic leaders are in a sweat trying to get a campaign finance bill passed_by early summer , before election-year pressure forces changes that lawmakers would find even more odious . House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) said House and Senate leaders believe that they can wrap_up informal talks on a compromise measure this week , clearing the way for rapid final approval . But a threatened GOP filibuster in the Senate could sabotage the plan . . . . Negotiators have had the most trouble with proposals to curb political_action_committees and to give public subsidies to congressional candidates who agree to spending limits . The Senate-passed bill would ban PACs ; the House would allow PACs to continue giving candidates up_to $ 5 # 000 per election . A compromise cap may be $ 4 # 000 . . . . Foley suggested that leaders have agreed to slap a steep registration fee on PACs to help fund the campaign subsidies . * IRONY IN YEMEN : War is often punctuated with strange footnotes . To wit : A group of 200 former Palestinian guerrillas were in Yemen , training for a new role as police_officers after years of war with Israel . But when civil_war erupted , they suddenly had no place to go . For days , as Westerners , Saudis and others fled the country , everyone , including the United States , refused to help the Palestinians get_out . The new peace_officers eventually escaped to Egypt when Saudi_Arabia changed its mind and provided assistance , according to diplomatic sources . * DITTO IN TUNISIA : If that weren ' t irony enough , consider this recent episode involving Yasser Arafat , leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization . . . . First , some background : Richard Nixon was the President who with his national security adviser , Henry Kissinger , banned all U.S. contacts with the PLO -- a policy that lasted two decades . Under the circumstances , Arafat might have been the unlikeliest person in the world to feel any grief about Nixon ' s death . Yet in the midst of all_the final negotiations for a Palestinian entity in Jericho and the Gaza Strip , he took time_out to go_to the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia and sign the condolence book for Nixon . &quot; With all our heartfelt condolences to President Clinton and the American people on the death of President Nixon , &quot; Arafat wrote . &quot; From myself , personally , and the Palestinian people. &quot; . . . After signing the book , he went upstairs to chat with Ambassador John McCarthy . Many State_Department officials are astonished . * TIMES CHANGE : In the 1992 elections , no one more_than Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) took_advantage of -- and benefited from -- Anita Faye Hill ' s sexual_harassment charges against conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas . The liberal Boxer was strongly sympathetic to Hill ' s allegations , pressing for high-profile Senate hearings and building her campaign around the brouhaha . . . . Now though , with Paula Corbin Jones accusing the President of sexual_harassment , Boxer is taking a lower profile -- a mere one-liner in which she says the &quot; proper forum &quot; for Jones ' charges is the judicial_system . . . . On May 28 , Boxer , a staunch Clinton ally , will attend the White_House wedding of her daughter , Nicole , to Anthony Rodham , a brother of First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton .
