   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; BELIEVABILITY TAKES A LEAP IN HWANG ' S ' GATE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Golden Gate &quot; ( selected theaters ) is as ambitious as it is disastrous . David Henry Hwang , who wrote &quot; M . Butterfly , &quot; one of the most provocative and successful American plays in recent years , has taken an important premise only to let it lapse into a protracted soap_opera . The question Hwang poses implicitly is this : How many of us are aware that Chinese Americans were subjected_to persecution by the FBI because the Communist Revolution in China happened to coincide with the McCarthy era ? In its opening sequences , &quot; Golden Gate &quot; would seem to be illuminating this injustice in promising fashion . It ' s San Francisco , 1952 , and J . Edgar Hoover has ordered the local bureau to ferret_out commies in Chinatown . Brand-new agent Kevin Walker ( Matt Dillon ) hits upon an idea : Go_after a laundryman , Chen Jung Song ( Tzi Ma , in the film ' s most eloquent performance ) , who has collected funds to send via Hong Kong to his and his friends ' impoverished relatives in the recently formed People ' s Republic_of_China . In the climate of anti-communist hysteria it ' s not hard to get him sent to prison for 10 years for &quot; trading with the enemy. &quot; Upon his release he ' s shunned by his community , and since Walker is ordered to hound him some more , the laundryman jumps to his death off a promontory overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge . Walker at long last commences to get a serious case of guilt . So far OK , but darned if Walker , concealing his identity , proceeds to court the dead man ' s beautiful daughter Marilyn ( Joan Chen ) , now a Berkeley law_student involved in a campaign to clear her father ' s name , which fits right in with the mood of the anti-war activist ' 60s . Since Dillon and Chen look_like movie_stars , their mutual attraction is certainly credible , and what Hwang attempts is to stir_up a love between them so overpowering that it overrides both Walker ' s well-deserved sense_of_shame and Marilyn ' s horror when she inevitably finds_out that her lover is the man who systematically and unjustly destroyed her father . Tempestuous emotions trigger lots of scenery-chewing , leading to increasing ludicrousness . In danger of drowning in the suds is Hwang ' s important point that there ' s a tendency to regard Asian Americans as &quot; perpetual foreigners. &quot; Chen and especially Dillon are gallant , but they don ' t seem to get much help from director John Madden , whose first theatrical film was &quot; Ethan Frome. &quot; Madden directs everything head on , without a trace of subtlety or understatement . Thanks to Hwang ' s writing , compounded by Madden ' s heavy hand , Bruno Kirby , as Walker ' s straight-arrow superior , and Stan Egi , as a fiery ' 60s activist , emerge as caricatures . &quot; Golden Gate &quot; looks great , thanks to the meticulous , evocative contributions of production designer Andrew Jackness , costume_designer Ingrid Ferrin and cinematographer Bobby Bukowski , but it ' s pure dross .
