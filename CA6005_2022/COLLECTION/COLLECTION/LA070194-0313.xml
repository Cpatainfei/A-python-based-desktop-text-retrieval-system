   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; LET ' S GET PHYSICAL ; FITNESS COMES INTO PLAY FOR THE BEST IN LOOKS AND HEALTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You know the commercial . Two beautiful teen-agers -- with sleek , well-toned bodies -- meet at the beach and fall_in_love over a can of soda . How often have you watched that commercial and thought , &quot; If only I had a body like that , my troubles would melt into oblivion &quot; ? Maybe you are munching potato_chips and drinking the advertised soda as that thought drifts through your head . You shrug and return to the TV , convinced that no matter how hard you tried , you would never look_like they do . While it ' s true that none of us will ever look just like the teens in the commercial -- we were each born with our individual genetic makeup -- it is also true that there is much each person can do to affect his or her physical_fitness . For many body- and health-conscious teens , exercise has become an important part of their lives . &quot; Most teen-agers aren ' t really happy with their bodies , so working_out makes them feel better about themselves , &quot; says Julie Deschenes , a student at El Modena High_School in Orange . People who are heavyset are often ridiculed on campus and in the media , and most teens don ' t want to endure that ridicule . As Christy Vollmer , a June graduate of Huntington Beach High_School , says : &quot; I want to stay fit because of society ' s pressure . I don ' t want to get fat. &quot; Body image is not the only reason teens are choosing to exercise . For many , exercise allows them to clear their heads and vent their frustrations . &quot; Working_out is a way to relieve myself from stress , &quot; says Mary Lou Soot , a student at El Modena High_School . &quot; It keeps me sane and helps my self-confidence . I like amazing myself , pushing myself to the limit to see how far I can go. &quot; Physically fit people are less likely to have serious health_problems . &quot; I have a desire to keep myself in shape . I ' ve seen people who are not in shape who have medical problems . I don ' t want to end_up like that , &quot; El Modena student Garrett Kerr says . Student athletes often exercise in the off-season to increase their competitive chances next season . Vicki Crookshanks , who runs track at Santa Margarita High_School in Rancho Santa Margarita , runs distance during the off-season to increase her stamina . Page Kishiyama , a wrestler at El Modena , builds his muscles during the off-season in an attempt to &quot; intimidate &quot; other wrestlers on the mats . * Some exercise-minded teens have memberships in gyms or fitness centers , giving them access to weights , aerobic classes , step machines , stationary bikes and treadmills . Members usually combine weight training with cardiovascular training , and many participate in aerobic classes , saying the dance-like routines help break the monotony of individual workouts . While there are advantages to belonging_to a fitness club , there is one glaring drawback -- the cost . The price of membership is more_than many teens on limited budgets can afford . But it ' s not necessary to set foot inside a gym to achieve physical_fitness . Bicycling and hiking allow you to enjoy nature and get_in shape at_the_same_time . Exercise videos ( about $ 20 ) are an inexpensive substitute for aerobic classes , and many are aimed at particular &quot; trouble spots &quot; of the body . Whatever their reasons for giving_it_a_try , teens are finding the benefits of exercise in an improved build , better health and increased peace_of_mind . Exercise alone is not the key to physical_fitness , though . A healthy diet is necessary for healing and &quot; feeding &quot; developing muscles , according to Thomas Hollins , a fitness counselor and trainer at a Family Fitness Center in Orange . Teens who work_out but abuse their bodies in other ways , through diet and alcohol or drug_abuse , lower the efficiency of their exercise . The cholesterol in fast food , a serious downfall in the diet of many teens , can clog arteries and diminish cardiovascular stamina . Alcohol depletes the body ' s vitamin resources and blocks the use of carbohydrates in muscle activities . * Back to the commercial with the two beautiful teen-agers with sleek , well-toned bodies . The next time you watch that commercial , put_down your potato_chips and remember that it ' s unlikely those teens just woke_up one morning with perfect bodies . It is very likely , though , that they exercise regularly . Becoming physically fit doesn ' t make troubles melt away , but the way you look_at those troubles may change along with the shape of your body .</TEXT>
