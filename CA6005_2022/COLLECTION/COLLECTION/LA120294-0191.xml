   <HEADLINE> SENATE APPROVES SWEEPING PACT TO REVISE GLOBAL TRADE RULES ; GATT : ACCORD DESIGNED TO OPEN MARKETS MAKES DEEP CUTS IN TARIFFS , QUOTAS . THE 76-24 BIPARTISAN VOTE CAPS YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND POLITICAL DEBATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After seven years of negotiations and a year of political debate , an agreement that massively reorders the rules governing world trade was approved by the Senate on Thursday , making deep cuts_in tariffs and quotas intended to bring more fairness to international commerce and a burst of growth to the world economy . The bipartisan vote was 76 to 24 . The measure has been a centerpiece of President Clinton ' s economic program . Administration officials said that it will open Europe , Japan and the emerging markets of developing nations to ever-more goods and services produced in American offices , factories and fields , creating new jobs in the process . Senate approval of the accord -- which was endorsed by the House on Tuesday and now goes_to Clinton for his signature -- brought_to a close the tumultuous 103rd Congress . The President had called the lawmakers back to Washington for a rare post-election session to vote on the agreement . The trade accord will vastly expand the reach of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , created in 1947 , beyond the traditional arena of manufacturing to cover agriculture and , to a lesser extent , financial services and such intellectual endeavors as the creation of pharmaceuticals and entertainment productions . The &quot; future prosperity of our nation &quot; rests_on the pact , said departing Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , who cast his final votes_in the Senate . &quot; The agreement is a very good_deal for America and a very great improvement on the current ( trading ) system , &quot; Mitchell said . Clinton , saluting the Senate in remarks at the White_House Diplomatic Entrance , said that the vote &quot; shows once again that our country is moving_in the right direction , reaching_out to the rest of the world and looking_at the best interests of_our_own people. &quot; Approval of the agreement by the United States is expected to spur other nations to act , so that it can go_into effect Jan . 1 . So far , 36 of the 124 nations considered likely to take_part have given formal approval to the plan , among them Germany , Britain , Mexico , Chile , Singapore , Malaysia and Thailand . Japan is expected to act_on the measure as early as today . &quot; This is a decision that is going_to have an impact around the world , a positive impact , &quot; said Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who is all but certain to be Senate majority_leader when the new Congress convenes in a month . &quot; Let ' s face it , &quot; Dole said . &quot; We ' re going to be the big beneficiary -- the United States of America. &quot; But Sen . Ernest F . Hollings ( D-S.C. ) , bitter in his opposition to the agreement , said after the vote : &quot; This is the gravest mistake that the U.S. has ever made on economic policy. &quot; And Sen . Byron L . Dorgan ( D-N.D. ) argued that the pact would continue earlier trade practices and allow multinational companies to drive down U.S. wages by employing low-paid foreign laborers . &quot; This is one more big drink from the same old bottle , &quot; he said . As wide as the impact of the agreement is likely to be , it lit few sparks on the floor of the Senate . For most of the 20 hours of debate , which began Wednesday , there were rarely more_than half_a_dozen senators in the chamber at any moment and the visitors ' galleries were half empty . The accord would cut tariffs by an average of 38 % , eliminating them in such important sectors of the economy as steel , pharmaceuticals , paper and medical equipment . Republican and Democratic supporters alike predicted it will create 500 # 000 jobs in the United States as a result of increased commerce with other nations . Similarly , there is general_agreement that the $ 744 billion in tariffs that would be eliminated around the world , if the pact is fully implemented , will amount to the largest single_tax cut ever enacted anywhere . The 22 # 000 pages of the agreement spell_out the minutiae of rules that make_up the road map of international trade . In the United States , tariffs -- the taxes charged on imported goods -- would be eliminated on such diverse products as refrigerators , sewing_machines , small motorcycles and candles , creating new competition from foreign manufacturers suddenly given free access to free-spending American consumers . But there would be winners , too , in the United States as lowered tariffs around the world open foreign markets for U.S. companies and , the Administration has argued , jobs for American workers . Japan ' s taxes on shampoo , sunscreens and razor blades would be thrown_out , for example . The tariff on beef would be cut from 50 % to 38.5 % , on oranges from 40 % to 32 % , and on whiskey there would be a whopping reduction -- from 24.5 % to zero . In Europe , the tax on imported beer , now 24 % , would be eliminated . So , too , would be the 7 % tariff on swine and beef livers . And makers of American potato_chips would see the tariff on their products cut from 22 % to 14.1 % . Overall , 40 % of foreign products entering the United States will be sold duty-free , up from 10 % . For other industrial countries , that figure will increase to 44 % from the current 20 % . Profits , and some losses , will be greatest with some of the big-ticket items . With tariffs dropping , likely beneficiaries include makers of specialty steel products -- high-quality items turned_out by American labor from lower-quality steel made overseas . Others expected to benefit are farmers sending their grains to Europe , where subsidies to farmers there would be cut , forcing them to raise prices closer to the U.S. level . With greater sales abroad -- an increase of $ 8.5 billion by 2005 , according to one study -- U.S. farmers would receive less in U.S._government crop subsidies . The agreement would bring high-tech industries into the trading regime , affecting such products as computers , software and semiconductors , all products barely envisaged when developed nations fashioned the international trading system to impose a new economic order in the wake of World_War_II . Services , which account_for about 60 % of the U.S. economy , will be brought under the rules of the international trading community and made more open , contributing to a likely expansion of international operations in engineering , advertising and health_care . But in the critical area of financial services , covering banking and insurance , only general principles have been set_forth , and firm commitments to lower barriers still must be negotiated . The U.S. garment industry is widely seen as likely to suffer because lowered tariffs and quotas will make_it easier for foreign companies , some paying workers little more_than $ 1 a day , to undercut the prices that U.S. clothing manufacturers must charge . While the accord would increase copyright protections , the entertainment_industry was disappointed that U.S. negotiators failed last year to get Europe to drop its barriers to foreign-made movies and television productions and thus will not get a boost from the agreement . Critics argued that in agreeing to change the rules , the United States leaves itself open_to the demands of an international bureaucracy running the new_World Trade Organization , which will become the new regime governing world commerce , replacing the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- an organization that , confusingly , bears the same name as the agreement itself . The World Trade Organization , critics said , would have too_much authority to overturn U.S. laws protecting the environment and worker safety . Under a plan worked_out by Dole , a panel of U.S. appellate_court judges could be asked to determine whether the international panel was ruling arbitrarily against the United States . If they found that the trade body was operating unfairly , Congress could vote to the withdraw the United States from the agreement . The measure was approved by 35 Republicans and 41 Democrats , including California Sens . Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein . Thirteen Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against it . That final vote , however , was anticlimactic . The true test came earlier when 60 votes were needed to waive the Senate ' s budget_deficit rules . Sixty-eight senators voted for the waiver , while 32 were opposed . That earlier step was necessary because budget law requires Congress either to cut spending or raise taxes to match revenue that will disappear under the agreement . Overall , the trade plan would cut tariffs in the United States by $ 12 billion over the next five years and approximately $ 40 billion over 10 years -- although the measure ultimately would produce , by the Administration ' s count , three times as much in tax_income as a result of greater economic activity . Politically , the vote and the lobbying that preceded it created some of the strangest pairings in modern Washington , linking liberals and conservatives on both sides of the issue . In the end , the economic interests of individual states , rather than ideology , dictated votes , with corn-state senators -- Charles E . Grassley ( R-Iowa ) and Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) , for example , citing the agreement ' s anticipated boost for agriculture exports and Robert F . Bennett , a Republican from Utah , where computer software has become a growth_industry , cheering the accord ' s challenge to the burgeoning business in pirated computer_programs .
