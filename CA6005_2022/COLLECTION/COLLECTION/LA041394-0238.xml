   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A DUEL OVER PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ; COURT RULING BACKING STUDENT-INITIATED PRAYER IN TEXAS HAS LED OTHER STATES TO ACT . IT ' S ALSO LED TO A HEATED DEBATE OVER FREE SPEECH AND THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s springtime , when a high_school senior ' s thoughts turn_to the prom , summer vacation and the collegiate adventure just around the corner . But in this town -- and an increasing number like it across Texas -- many students are taking_on weightier matters and find themselves at Ground Zero_in a growing controversy over prayer in the public_schools . When three seniors at a public high_school here proposed that a prayer be read at their graduation ceremony last year , their idea was put to a vote . Their fellow students agreed with them , and prayer -- which for decades has been disappearing from the public_schools -- became part of the program . All across Texas , student-initiated prayer has spread like a prairie fire since a federal appeals court , breaking_with 30 years of judicial precedent , ruled last year that , while the Constitution bars school officials from initiating prayers , it does not stop students . And when the Supreme Court refused without explanation to review the appeals court ' s decision , Pat Robertson ' s American Center for Law and Justice took the movement nationwide . Last month it initiated what it called a &quot; nationwide campaign to educate students about their constitutional right to pray and to speak about God. &quot; In mailings to 35 # 000 school officials , the group asserted that students have a &quot; free speech &quot; right to have prayer at school events . The American Civil Liberties Union is waging a vigorous counter-campaign . School officials are caught in the cross-fire as the ACLU and Robertson ' s group mail dueling videotapes to every school_system in the country , the ACLU ' s stressing the traditional separation of church and state and Robertson ' s highlighting America ' s religious heritage . Lawmakers in at least nine states are following Texas ' lead . The legislatures in Georgia , Alabama , Tennessee , Mississippi and Virginia have passed measures authorizing student-initiated prayer at school events , and similar bills are pending in Florida , South Carolina , Louisiana and Oklahoma . The U.S. Senate also debated long into the night last month over an amendment sponsored by Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) to shield &quot; constitutionally protected prayer &quot; in the schools . In the end , the Senate and House agreed only on a watered-down provision that would bar schools from using federal funds to stop &quot; voluntary prayer &quot; at school . The latest burst of activity stems from last year ' s ruling by the federal appeals court based in New Orleans . &quot; A majority of students can do what the state , acting_on its own , cannot do to incorporate prayer in the public_school high_school graduation ceremonies , &quot; wrote Judge Thomas Reavley of Austin in upholding a prayer at a suburban Houston high_school . That ruling seemed to rub against the grain of more_than three decades of Supreme Court decisions prohibiting official school prayers , daily Bible readings , the teaching of creationism , a state-mandated moment of silence for voluntary prayer and the posting of the Ten Commandments . Yet the Supreme Court last June refused to review the appeals court ' s decision . That same month , a federal judge in Boise , Ida . -- citing the Texas decision -- upheld the students ' right to have a graduation prayer . A day later , however , a federal judge in Virginia blocked a planned graduation prayer in Loudon County , ruling that the Constitution did not permit &quot; students by a majority vote to impose a prayer on the minority. &quot; Religious-rights advocates heralded the Texas decision as a landmark in the law governing religion and public education . Jay A . Sekulow , chief counsel of Robertson ' s law and justice center -- a public policy law_firm based in Virginia Beach , Va . -- threatened to send &quot; legal SWAT teams &quot; to communities that blocked a prayer or &quot; censored &quot; its contents . On the other side , the ACLU accused the &quot; extreme right &quot; of distorting the law and pressuring schools to permit prayer again . &quot; This is an incredibly well-coordinated campaign , &quot; said Phil Gutis , an ACLU official in New York . &quot; They can talk_about this being led by students , but the religious right is spending millions of dollars to reintroduce prayer into the schools. &quot; The back-and-forth has often resulted in murkiness for school_boards , students and parents , who are not sure what they may do , if anything . When they do venture into the legal thicket , they often end_up with bland recitations that satisfy no one and hardly qualify as prayers . &quot; This has caused a horrible mess , &quot; said Gwendolyn Gregory , deputy general counsel for the National School_Boards Assn . in Alexandria , Va . &quot; They don ' t know who to believe . They get these missives from the ACLU and the ACLJ , and they are totally contradictory. &quot; Baylor University law professor David Guinn , asked last spring to advise school districts in central Texas , found board_members torn by conflicting pressures . &quot; These are fine , sweet , bewildered laymen who say : ' Tell us what to do , ' &quot; Guinn said . &quot; One side says they ' ll sue if you have prayer , and the other side says they ' ll sue if you don ' t have prayer. &quot; So what did he advise ? Guinn said he urged caution . &quot; If it ' s a religious exercise in the public_schools , I still think it ' s unconstitutional , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s also a charade to say all this is initiated voluntarily by the students. &quot; A_few legal points are not in_dispute . At one extreme , organized prayers in the classroom are forbidden . At the other , courts have recently decided that students may meet on campus in Bible study groups . But in between , the rules are not as clear . As late as June , 1992 , the Supreme Court in the case of Lee vs . Weisman ruled that the school district in Providence , R.I. , had violated the Constitution by inviting a cleric to deliver a graduation prayer . However , the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals , whose jurisdiction covers Texas , Louisiana and Mississippi , said a student-initiated prayer was another matter . That decision had an immediate impact in Round Rock , and it shows that prayer remains a powerful symbol , one that can quickly split a community . Round Rock ' s sprawling school district stretches_out to include the fast-growing suburbs north of Austin , but its center remains a conservative small_town where , until a_few years ago , prayer at Friday night football games was an unquestioned tradition . Within just a_few weeks , the fight over a graduation prayer overturned the school_board , led to the superintendent ' s ouster and drove a wedge between Christian activists who sought prayer and Jewish parents and others who opposed it . In the end , the graduation day exercises left both sides unhappy . It began in April of last year when three seniors at Westwood High_School told their principal they wanted a prayer at their graduation . But veteran Schools Supt . Dan McLendon had recently issued a directive to principals that prohibited prayer over the public_address_system at football games and other school events . &quot; It wasn ' t that I ' m opposed to prayer . I ' m a ' born-again ' Christian , &quot; McLendon said in an interview . But the district ' s lawyers , citing the Supreme Court ruling in the Providence case , said the school Administration should not be involved in promoting prayer . Christian activists took offense at the superintendent ' s no-prayer dictum , and three local leaders declared their candidacy for the school_board . Citing the appeals court decision in the Houston case that sanctioned student-initiated prayer , they won an easy victory last May . &quot; This is a right of the students . I see it as a matter of freedom of expression and freedom_of_religion , &quot; said Kathy Seay , a newly elected board_member . After a raucous public meeting , the new board majority passed a resolution authorizing student prayers based on a majority vote . At Westwood High , the seniors met in an assembly and , with little discussion , voted_in favor of a graduation prayer . But it remained unclear whether the prayer could be explicitly religious . The Texas case , Jones vs . Clear Creek , spoke_of a &quot; non-sectarian , non-proselytizing prayer , &quot; but that limitation has spawned new litigation elsewhere in Texas . In McAllen , for example , Schools Supt . Jose Lopez announced that students could refer to a &quot; neutral deity &quot; such_as &quot; Lord , God , father , etc. &quot; but they could not make &quot; specific references_to Jesus_Christ , Mohammed , etc. &quot; Several students said they wanted to pray &quot; in the name of Jesus , &quot; and they went_to court aided by a lawyer furnished by the Rutherford Institute , a Charlottesville , Va. , group that champions religious liberty . Its lawyers have been especially active in Texas defending student-initiated prayers and on-campus Bible clubs . &quot; We have 22 lawsuits under way just in Texas , &quot; said Kelly Shackelford , a regional coordinator in Dallas . In the McAllen lawsuit , the students said that &quot; as one of their normal religious tenets , when they pray . . . they sincerely believe that their religious faith compels prayer in the name of Jesus. &quot; Three months ago , a federal judge rejected their claim , but the Rutherford Institute is taking the issue to the 5th Circuit Court . That controversy raises a second question : Who must assure that the student prayer is not &quot; sectarian &quot; or &quot; proselytizing &quot; ? At Westwood High , principal Linda Watkins said she was advised to &quot; edit &quot; the prayer written by the three students , although she felt uncomfortable doing so . &quot; This was my first experience with this issue , &quot; she said . &quot; So I talked to our attorney . I was told it shouldn ' t say anything about ' Our Heavenly Father , ' &quot; she said . &quot; The general feeling is that the prayer has to be pretty innocuous , &quot; said Pat Ahearn , director of legal services for the Texas Assn . of School_Boards . &quot; Maybe it can mention God . Maybe not. &quot; And what about the minority of students who do not want a prayer ? Watkins says she was concerned about the 99 seniors who voted no . &quot; That number tells me there was significant opposition , &quot; she said . But Seay , the board_member , was more worried about the 379 who voted yes . &quot; In a democracy , the majority_rules . Over the last 30 years , I think we have sort of turned that around so that the minority rules. &quot; The Supreme Court failed to resolve that dispute , but its last written opinion on the issue focused_on the rights of dissenting students in Providence . Its author , as well as the pivotal vote_in the case , was Justice Anthony M . Kennedy . An appointee of President Ronald Reagan , Kennedy had earlier voiced support for religion ' s role in public education , but he swung the other way in the Providence case . He concluded that a non-religious student should not be forced to hear a religious message as a condition of receiving her diploma . &quot; What to most believers may seem nothing more_than a reasonable request that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices , in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the state to enforce a religious orthodoxy , &quot; Kennedy wrote for the 5-4 majority that struck_down graduation prayer in Providence . &quot; The Constitution forbids the state to exact religious conformity from a student as the price of attending her high_school graduation. &quot; Kennedy ' s powerful affirmation of the separation of church and state reportedly stunned several of his conservative colleagues . A few months later , when the appeal arrived contesting the student-initiated prayer in Houston , neither the conservative nor the liberal faction at the high_court could count_on mustering a majority . Instead , the justices agreed only to put_off the issue until later . That leaves Round Rock one of many communities grasping for direction . Carlos Higgins , a former school_board member , said the graduation prayer issue &quot; has divided this community and encouraged conflict among neighbors . There are nine of them up there ( at the Supreme Court ) , so they can ' t have a tie vote . I ' m disappointed they didn ' t decide this one way or the other. &quot; With no clear direction from the high_court , the student prayer went_ahead as scheduled at last year ' s June graduation at Westwood High , but only after lawyers for the ACLU approved it . In an unusual arrangement , the school district ' s lawyer faxed a copy of a student ' s prayer to the ACLU office in Austin a_few days before graduation . Satisfied all religious references from the prayer had been deleted , the ACLU dropped a last-minute legal effort to block it . &quot; It was so watered down that I would n ' t call it a prayer , &quot; said ACLU attorney Patrick Wiseman . &quot; There was not even an ' amen. ' It was more like a statement. &quot; Nonetheless , the new school_board members arrived_at the Westwood graduation pleased that they had at least stood_up for the students ' right to free speech . Even that victory proved a mixed blessing . After one senior delivered the brief , non-religious invocation , the board_members stood grim-faced as the class valedictorian arose and denounced the board for pushing a &quot; right-wing agenda. &quot; &quot; What I told them was that this is the first_step on the slippery slope toward bringing_back prayer in school , &quot; said Abhi Shellat , now a freshman at Harvard_University . &quot; If the prayer offended one person in the class , then we shouldn ' t have had it. &quot;</TEXT>
