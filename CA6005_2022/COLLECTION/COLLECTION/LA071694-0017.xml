   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA OUTRAGED BY U.S. SENATE CONDITION ON AID ; EUROPE : OFFICIALS , LAWMAKERS DENOUNCE MEASURE TYING ECONOMIC HELP TO TROOP WITHDRAWAL FROM ESTONIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian diplomats and lawmakers reacted with outrage Friday to a U.S. Senate vote linking aid to Russia to the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia by Aug . 31 . Senior Russian diplomat Vitaly S . Churkin denounced the U.S. attempt to pressure Russia into removing remnants of the occupying Red Army from its Baltic neighbor as &quot; counterproductive and wrong , &quot; while the lower house of Parliament condemned it as unwarranted meddling in Russia ' s affairs . Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev said Russia &quot; categorically rejects any linkage &quot; of troop withdrawals to economic aid . Kozyrev said a delegation of Russian lawmakers that left for Washington on Friday would be asked to &quot; talk to the American senators before this thing goes too far. &quot; President Clinton , during his European visit last week , tried to broker smoother relations between Russia and the Baltic_states by calling_for Russian troop withdrawals and ethnic tolerance from Baltic citizens . But the past week has brought new unpleasantness between Russia and Estonia , Sweden , Latvia and now the United States . Russia has about 2 # 000 troops still stationed on Estonian soil . At a joint news_conference with Clinton last week , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin suddenly announced he would not withdraw the troops by Aug . 31 , as Russia had promised , because of &quot; gross violations &quot; of the human_rights of Estonia ' s large Russian-speaking minority . Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia have all clashed with Russia over citizenship rights for hundreds of thousands of migrants who settled in the Baltics after the Soviet_Union annexed the three nations in the wake of World_War_II . The Baltic nations claim that &quot; occupants &quot; who do not speak their language are not entitled to automatic citizenship , while Russia asserts that people who have lived_in Estonia and Latvia for decades are being hounded out_in what amounts to &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; Prime_Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden , which has been monitoring the citizenship issue , said Yeltsin ' s claim of gross human_rights violations in Estonia is &quot; erroneous and false. &quot; The Russian Foreign Ministry promptly retorted , calling Bildt ' s statement &quot; tactless and irresponsible. &quot; But most of Moscow ' s ire has been directed at the United States since the Senate voted , 89-9 , on Wednesday to approve a GOP amendment that would suspend most aid to Russia unless it has withdrawn all_of its troops from the Baltic_states by the August deadline or strikes an agreement for withdrawal . Exempt from the cutoff would be food and other humanitarian aid , student exchange programs and assistance to resettle Russian soldiers . Clinton , however , could ignore the provision under a waiver that would allow him to continue the aid if he determines it to be in the national security_interest . Although the waiver makes the amendment largely symbolic , it struck a sensitive nationalist nerve -- even among Russian liberals . &quot; Never tell us what we have to do , especially when it concerns our interests , &quot; said Boris G . Fyodorov , the former finance_minister who is considered a die-hard pro-Western reformer . &quot; If Russians are endangered in any of these countries , we shall do ( what ) Americans do all_over the world , &quot; he said , brandishing an index_finger . &quot; We shall be learning from the American democratic tradition how to send troops to some places . If you do_it , why can ' t we do_it ? &quot; A great_power must defend its threatened citizens and its interests , whether in Grenada or Haiti or Tallinn , the Estonian capital , Fyodorov and other lawmakers said . &quot; I spent seven years in Soviet prisons , and there were Estonians among my cellmates , &quot; said former dissident and lawmaker Mikhail M . Molostovov . &quot; We fought together for freedom and democracy . . . . And now , it is such a shocking , unpleasant surprise &quot; to see the Estonians adopt &quot; unjust &quot; anti-Russian laws . Estonia welcomed the Senate vote . At a news_conference in Moscow on Friday , Vello Saatpalu , chairman of the Estonian Parliament ' s foreign affairs committee , said that , besides the 2 # 000 Russian troops , Estonia has 12 # 000 to 13 # 000 retired Russian officers living_on its soil -- a potentially destabilizing force in a nation of 1.5 million . About 40 # 000 people have been naturalized as Estonian citizens , 30 # 000 have applied for Russian citizenship , and about 80 # 000 non-Estonians have left the country in the past four years , Saatpalu said . More_than half a_million non-Estonians were living_in Estonia at the time of independence in 1991 . Sharpening tensions further this week were reports in Russian media that Estonian President Lennart Meri and former Prime_Minister Mart Laar had sent greetings to a reunion of Estonian veterans of the Nazi SS division . The Russian foreign_minister called the congratulatory message &quot; blasphemy &quot; and said the Estonian SS division had been responsible_for the mass extermination of civilians . Saatpalu said the Estonian SS division had been hastily formed as Hitler ' s army collapsed to defend against the invading Red Army . He said the allegations of massacres were &quot; lies , brazen lies. &quot; Despite these frictions , Russian and Estonian sources said that planning is continuing for a meeting between Meri and Yeltsin that Clinton had requested in hopes of resolving the conflict . But Russia is dissatisfied with a citizenship bill proposed by Latvia , and a scheduled visit by Russian Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin to Riga may be canceled , officials said . The last Russian troops are expected to leave Latvia on schedule by Aug . 31 . Russia withdrew the last troops from Lithuania last August .</TEXT>
