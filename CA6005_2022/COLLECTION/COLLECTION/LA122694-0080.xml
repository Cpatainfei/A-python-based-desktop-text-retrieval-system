   <HEADLINE> STATE COLLEGE ENROLLMENTS FALL SLIGHTLY ; EDUCATION : FIGURES FOLLOW NATIONAL TRENDS AND SHOW A STRONG COMEBACK FROM LAST YEAR . OFFICIALS PARTIALLY CREDIT ECONOMIC RECOVERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mirroring nationwide trends , California ' s two largest public higher education systems experienced only slight enrollment declines this fall , a strong reversal to the sharp drops of last year . Enrollments in California ' s community_colleges fell 1.4 % to about 1.36 million students , compared to a 9 % loss in 1993 , a spokesman said . California State University enrollments declined 1.9 % to 319 # 394 students this fall , from a 6.3 % drop the year before . The results mirror those of a national report to be released today by the American Council on Education , the nation ' s main higher education lobby . The council suggests that a similar pattern of moderation in enrollment losses has occurred this fall_in their survey of selected states . &quot; Nationally , I think it ' s slowing , &quot; said David Merkowitz , a council spokesman . This fall , 11 of the 17 states with the most complete survey data reported overall enrollment declines , slightly fewer states than a year ago . Private_school enrollments have increased in 12 of 18 states surveyed . Merkowitz said the tallies released today account_for about 40 % of nationwide enrollment . Earlier this fall , however , the U.S. Department_of_Education , based on a sampling of actual institutions rather than selected states , forecast a new high of 14.7 million students , a slight increase over 1993 . The department couched the numbers for both years as estimates . Officials in California said the end to steep public enrollment losses this fall reflects the state ' s economic recovery . Also , the state ' s public higher education systems fared better financially this year after deep budget_cuts earlier in the decade . The enrollment declines had alarmed college and university educators , who feared that students were being shut_out of the systems because of cutbacks in classes and higher fees . Historically , California has prided itself in providing some level of post-secondary education to any student who sought it . The $ 390 per year in fees charged a full-time community_college student is nearly four times the price of 1990 . Cal State ' s annual $ 1 # 584 fee is more_than double 1990 ' s charge . A year ago , total enrollments in California ' s three public higher education systems -- community_colleges , Cal State and the University of California -- fell 8 % to 1.87 million , the largest drop_in the nation , one study found . This fall , the total loss will probably be less than 2 % . Although the enrollment news is not as bad as in previous years , the new figures still mark the third consecutive year of enrollment declines for the 107-campus community_college system , and the fourth straight year for the 20-campus Cal State system . California ' s community_college enrollment hit its lowest level this fall since 1988 , with about 1.33 million students . The Cal State system ' s enrollment hit its lowest mark since 1984 , when fall enrollment stood at 316 # 000 , records show . Among Cal State campuses in the region , Northridge suffered the largest loss , 10.9 % , because of the January earthquake . The Long_Beach , Fullerton , Pomona and San Bernardino campuses had small declines . The Los Angeles , Dominguez Hills and San Diego campuses had small gains . Officials in the nine-campus UC system , which has also been hit with enrollment losses for the past three years , could not be reached to provide their fall enrollment figures .</TEXT>
