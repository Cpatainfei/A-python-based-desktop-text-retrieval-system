   <TEXT> Attorney Scott Fouser had wondered how he would ever get the resources needed to file appeals on behalf of Aurelio Barajas , 33 , a Mexican national sentenced to die in Idaho for the vicious murder of a convenience_store clerk . Out of the blue in November , Mexican government officials called to offer whatever he needed . &quot; They ' ve already hired an investigator , &quot; Fouser said . &quot; And they ' re flying me to Mexico , where I ' ll have a room , meals , car , interpreter and driver and meet with people who know Aurelio ' s background. &quot; The Barajas case is just one example of a new , aggressive effort that Mexico is making on behalf of its 22 citizens on Death Row in the United States . Mexico , which outlawed capital_punishment in 1929 , wants to help the inmates win new trials or have their death sentences commuted , said Laura Espinosa , deputy consulate in Salt_Lake_City . This could help the inmates take_advantage of existing extradition treaties and serve out life sentences , which in Mexico typically last 40 years . &quot; Imagine an American in a small_town in Mexico accused of killing someone , &quot; Espinosa said . &quot; We are going_to use the same force the United States would in such a case to help one of our own. &quot; Indeed , a nation that has long been accused of flouting the human_rights of Americans incarcerated there is turning the tables -- and getting results . The rapid intervention of Mexican officials was partially responsible_for persuading a Kentucky judge in May_not to apply the death_penalty in the case of two brothers convicted of a 1992 murder . The Mexican government also played an active role in postponing the execution of Ricardo Aldape , 31 , who was sentenced to die in September , 1992 , in Texas for killing a Houston police_officer 10 years earlier . Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari even sent a letter to Texas Gov . Ann Richards requesting clemency . The government is also helping the California Appellate Project find lawyers to represent Ramon Salcido , 32 , who is_on Death Row in San Quentin for the 1989 murders in Sonoma of his wife , four children , mother-in-law and employer . In November , officials of Mexico ' s Commission on Human_Rights and Foreign Relations Department interviewed these and other Death Row inmates in California , Arizona , Texas and Idaho with the aim of helping defense_lawyers and Mexican consuls conduct investigations on their behalf . Such efforts are causing deep resentment among American officials who see this as ideological meddling . &quot; The U.S. Supreme Court has said this is a constitutional type of punishment for a certain classification of crime , &quot; said Dane Gillette , state coordinator for capital litigation in California , which has 10 Mexican citizens on Death Row -- the most of any state . &quot; We ' re not punishing people for race or nationality , or sentencing people to death for spitting on the sidewalk . These are heinous crimes. &quot; Idaho Solicitor Gen . Lynn Thomas complains that &quot; we have enough trouble being outmanned by anti-death penalty organizations mounting campaigns against us . Now , we have to put_up with foreign governments bankrolling the opposition with unlimited resources. &quot; The danger , Thomas said , &quot; is one of mounting a public relations campaign that distorts the facts -- that ' s what happens when powerful special_interests get involved in a case. &quot; Fouser disagreed : &quot; I told the Mexican officials to do everything they feel is appropriate in the Barajas case . Public relations campaigns ? Go_for it ! &quot; Mexican officials would not reveal how much they have spent on such cases , in part , they say , because costs are virtually impossible to calculate . For example , background investigations inside Mexico are conducted by local and national law_enforcement authorities as part of their regular duties . But they say they are making a full-scale effort to &quot; prevent a Mexican citizen from receiving the death_penalty , &quot; said Espinosa , who has become an administrator of Death Row appeals for Mexican nationals in the Rocky Mountain_states . Mexican officials say they are resuming a long tradition ; in the 1920s , the Mexican consulate successfully pressured California to commute the death sentence of a Mexican minor and lobbied for state legislation prohibiting the execution of children . This most recent surge is simply a reflection of timing , they say . After a four-year gap , the death_penalty was reinstituted in the United States in 1976 . Most such cases take at least 15 years to wind through the courts . So , only recently have Mexican citizens in death_penalty cases begun to face execution . And working with such prisoners , Mexican officials say , has convinced them to get involved earlier in the sentencing and appeals process . Manuel Hernandez of the consulate office in El Paso said his country is compelled by a moral imperative to aid countrymen convicted of capital crimes . Mexico ' s involvement in such cases , he said , can help ensure that the inmates ' human and civil_rights are not violated , and that all available legal resources are exhausted before an execution takes_place . &quot; All the consulate offices in the United States have received instructions to follow these premises , &quot; Hernandez said , &quot; not only with death sentence cases , but with all our nationals incarcerated in the United States. &quot; In Mexico , only military_personnel are subject_to the death_penalty ; not even military_courts have carried_out executions for three decades . Mexican officials also cite studies showing that in the United States , the poor and minorities are more likely to be executed . Indeed , many Mexicans believe some of their countrymen on Death Row are victims of racism and that it is hard for Mexican nationals in capital cases to receive a fair trial . The March execution of Ramon Montoya in Huntsville , Tex. , was the top story in the Mexican press for weeks before and days afterward . Montoya , 38 , was convicted in the January , 1983 , shooting death of a Dallas police_officer . His last words -- &quot; Well , God help you &quot; -- were faithfully reported along with the detailed saga of his death by lethal injection . The day of Montoya ' s execution , riot police surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Mexico_City to protect it from citizens and human_rights groups demonstrating against the death_penalty . Later , he was given a hero ' s burial in Mexico , complete with mariachi escort to the cemetery and telegrams of condolence from top government and church officials . U.S. officials have several reasons to be wary of Mexico ' s involvement in American death_penalty cases . In 1984 , Luis Aviles , who had been convicted of killing a Houston taxi driver four years earlier , was returned to Mexico in a prisoner-exchange program . By 1988 , he was paroled and re-entered the United States illegally . In December of that year , he was arrested in Riverside in connection with another murder . Aviles , 34 , is now on Death Row in San Quentin . Also , MariClair Acosta , director of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human_Rights , sees an irony in Mexico ' s campaign against the U.S. death_penalty while abuses of civil_liberties exist within its own legal_system . &quot; I am not opposed to ( the Mexican effort to save its citizens on U.S. Death Rows ) ; I just do not understand it , &quot; Acosta said . &quot; We are more worried about what is happening inside the country . There are serious cases of human_rights abuses here that deserve the government ' s attention. &quot; Espinosa , the consular official in Salt_Lake_City , said : &quot; In Mexico , I know there is corruption and torture . It ' s true . I ' m not denying it . But over the last five years we have tried to eliminate these problems. &quot; Some human_rights activists say the Mexican government ' s efforts really don ' t amount to much . Francis Boyle , a professor at the University of Illinois ' College of Law at Champagne-Urbana , said President Salinas should seek international hearings to decide whether either country should put citizens to death . Boyle , a member of Amnesty International , the London-based human_rights organization , says that right now , Salinas is &quot; just posturing , throwing money at a problem to avoid taking a serious political step to save the lives of Mexicans on Death Row. &quot; Nonetheless , such cases have become rallying points for anti-death penalty groups in the United States and for government officials in Mexico , who have come under increasing public pressure in that country because of stories such_as Ricardo Aldape ' s . In that highly publicized case , Aldape was convicted of killing Houston Police_Officer James Harris in 1982 . His defense_attorney , Scott Atlas , said the Mexican government &quot; flew me to Mexico , took_care of accommodations and lined_up character witnesses . They also flew one of the witnesses up here for a hearing and arranged for my client ' s parents to come here and visit him. &quot; Atlas maintains that another man , Roberto Carrasco , shot and killed Harris . Carrasco died in the shootout . Aldape ' s name is now sung in sad Mexican ballads on both sides of the border and his picture is emblazoned on T-shirts that say : &quot; Soy Innocente &quot; ( &quot; I Am Innocent &quot; ) . The Idaho case of Aurelio Barajas is less well known in Mexico , but Fouser , with the support of Mexican officials , hopes to change all that . On Feb . 7 , a Payette County jury found Barajas guilty of first-degree murder in the June , 1992 , slaying of Fruitland , Ida. , store clerk Sherill Jean McDonald . Her throat was slashed with such force that a pathologist could see her vertebrae . The jury based its verdict on evidence that included a butcher_knife discovered in Barajas ' car with traces of McDonald ' s blood on it . But Fouser questions the adequacy of Barajas ' trial defense , as well as citing language difficulties and possible mental problems . In a pre-sentencing hearing , Barajas ' original defense_attorney , John Gatchel , argued that his client did not disclose an alibi until the second day of trial . As a result , the lawyer said , he did not have enough time to investigate the alibi or locate and interview witnesses who could support it . In that alibi , Barajas said the knife did not belong_to him and that he had loaned his car to an acquaintance on the night of the murder , according to court documents filed_in the case . Gatchel also argued that Barajas had displayed signs of paranoia and persecution and might be mentally incompetent . District Court Judge Gerald L . Weston dismissed the alibi argument and added that Barajas was found to be free_of &quot; depression , anxiety and loss of contact with reality &quot; during a three-hour examination by a court-appointed psychologist . Regrettably , Fouser said , the psychologist did not speak Spanish . Thomas shrugged_off Fouser ' s assertions , saying : &quot; There is no such thing as a perfect proceeding . &quot; The question is : Did any of these things undermine our confidence in the validity of the finding of guilt ? The answer is no . The evidence was overwhelming. &quot; A week ago , Barajas was transferred from the Idaho Maximum Security Institute ' s Death Row to a medical facility where he was being treated for possible psychotic behavior , Fouser said . Barajas was returned to Death Row last Monday . He refused to eat , claiming that his prison meals were laced with poison by &quot; people out_to get him , &quot; Fouser said . Barajas was also seen drinking_water out of the toilet , he said . &quot; We have to determine whether these symptoms are a new onset or if there is a history of them , &quot; Fouser said . &quot; Since I don ' t know of any Hispanic psychologists in the state of Idaho , I may ask the Mexican consulate about finding one who ' s bilingual. &quot; Espinosa calls the case a &quot; frame-up of an innocent man. &quot; &quot; Our goal is to get him a new trial , &quot; Espinosa said . &quot; If he is taken_off Death Row and given a life sentence , he may be able to complete it in Mexico. &quot; Paul McMurdie , chief counsel of the appeals section of the Arizona attorney_general ' s office , defended Mexico ' s interest in such cases . &quot; I ' m not afraid of Mexico helping these Mexican nationals -- in some respects it will save the state of Arizona some money &quot; in defense_attorney ' s costs , McMurdie said . But he also suggested that the Mexican government may be grasping at straws . &quot; I truly believe the Mexican nationals we have_on Death Row deserve to be there , &quot; he said .
