   <HEADLINE> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY ; HE MIGHT BE RIGHT , BUT WHO IS HE TO TALK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Words to inspire as athletes prepare_for the USA-Mobil Outdoor Track_and_Field Championships that begin today at Knoxville , Tenn. : &quot; Track_and_field is the sports equivalent of the witness protection program ; it ' s a place where you can be completely anonymous , &quot; actor Kevin Pollack said upon presenting an ESPY award to sprinter Michael Johnson . Michael Johnson , we know . But Kevin Pollack ? * Pollack , of course , is not entirely incorrect . Track_and_field seldom enters into the average American sports fan ' s consciousness , a reality for which the sport ' s officials , athletes and agents have only themselves to blame . The meet at Knoxville is one of the two best in the country this year -- the other is the United States-Africa dual meet scheduled for Durham , N.C. , in August -- and should be a showcase for the top U.S. athletes . Many will be there , including Jackie Joyner-Kersee , Gail Devers , Gwen Torrence , Mike Powell , Quincy Watts , Butch Reynolds , Kevin Young , Dan O ' Brien and Johnson . But because of friction between USA Track_and_Field and the Santa Monica Track Club , three of the world ' s fastest sprinters -- Carl Lewis , Leroy Burrell and Mike Marsh -- are planning to boycott . No matter what the issues are in this particular dispute , the real issue is that Santa Monica ' s manager , Joe Douglas , does not believe USATF is progressive enough in promoting the sport or its athletes . He is right , although it does not seem as if a boycott by his athletes will help achieve those goals , either . * National champions will qualify for the track_and_field competition in the July 23-Aug . 7 Goodwill Games at St . Petersburg , Russia , but Lewis , Burrell and Marsh also will be there because they received at-large invitations . Waiting for Lewis and Burrell in the 100 meters will be Great Britain ' s Olympic and world champion , Linford Christie . &quot; I run in fear of losing , &quot; Christie said in a recent interview with London ' s Daily Mail . &quot; I run because I like to hear ' God Save the Queen ' instead of ' The Star Spangled Banner. ' &quot; * After training for two months in Westwood with Coach John Smith , Marie-Jose Perec returned home to France to compete in a meet Friday , beating Torrence in the 200 meters . In a Paris news_conference the previous day , she said one reason she likes living_in the United States is the aggressive approach to shopping . &quot; Achetez , achetez jusqu ' a ce que vous tombiez ! &quot; she said . It doesn ' t have the same rhyme to it in French , but she meant , &quot; Shop , shop until you drop. &quot; * Water_polo player Dan Leyson , who will play for the United States in the June 23-26 Alamo Cup at Newport Beach , wrote_about Otto Schindler ' s list in a research paper for a class at USC four years before the Academy Award-winning movie was released . Leyson learned of the list from his father , whose family was saved when hired by Schindler to work in one of his factories during the Holocaust . * As expected , the USOC approved plans during a board of directors meeting over the weekend in Boston to decrease the number of U.S. Olympic festivals between Summer Olympics from three to two . The move is expected to save the USOC $ 4.2 million , but the real reason for doing_it is to cut_back on multisport competitions . In the 14-month period between last February and next March , the USOC and its sports governing bodies will have had to prepare athletes for the Winter_Olympics , the U.S. Olympic Festival , the Goodwill Games and the Pan American Games . The USOC ' s executive committee will decide on Aug . 1 the exact years for the Festival . During the span between 1996 and 2000 , the winter sports ' governing bodies prefer 1997 and 1999 . Notes After losing $ 44 million on the first Goodwill Games in 1986 and $ 27 million on the second in 1990 , Ted Turner estimated that he will lose only $ 10 million this summer . That is encouraging enough for him to proclaim last week during a news_conference that nothing could prevent the 1998 Goodwill Games , scheduled for New York , from happening . . . . &quot; Well , maybe a world_war , &quot; he added , &quot; depending_on whom was fighting whom. &quot; . . . . Greg Louganis , who won four Olympic gold medals , will perform in an exhibition Monday at the Gay Games in New York . A few days later , during the July 1-10 U.S. Olympic Festival in St . Louis , he will receive the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s Robert J . Kane Award , which goes_to a former Festival athlete who has given_back to his sport . . . . Cities bidding to stage future Olympic festivals are Dallas , Phoenix , Portland , Seattle and Richmond , Va . Next summer ' s Festival has been awarded to three Colorado cities -- Denver , Boulder and Colorado Springs . Los Angeles and Anaheim made a joint bid for the U.S. Olympic Congress in 1997 , ' 98 or ' 99 , but the winners were Orlando , Phoenix and Dallas . . . . As the USOC was leaving Boston , the International Skating Union was arriving for its annual meeting . The U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . is attempting to push_through a rule that would open the sport even further to professionals . The USFSA would like for all skaters to be eligible for ISU competitions as long as they do not participate in unsanctioned events . . . . The USFSA has announced its entrants for the Goodwill Games . Among Southern Californians on the list are Michelle Kwan and the pairs team of Stephanie Stiegler and Lance Travis . . . . All three train at Lake Arrowhead ' s Ice Castle International Training Center .</TEXT>
