   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; NOTEBOOK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> USA Hockey , the sport ' s national governing body , is reserving judgment on the Dream Team idea for the 1998 Nagano Winter Games in Japan . Dave Ogrean , the organization ' s executive_director , said the format might discourage youngsters in USA Hockey ' s developmental programs , some of whom have earned berths on the Olympic team in previous years . They would lose that incentive if NHL players took those spots , Ogrean said . &quot; that ' s one of the biggest philosophical dilemmas to deal with , &quot; he added . &quot; We don ' t have a formal position on this . A lot of people , and it ' s not entirely inappropriate , cling_to the experience of 1980 ( when college players dominated the roster of the gold-medal U.S. team ) . The truth is , though , the sports world and the hockey world have changed since then , like it or not . Our mind is open , but we ' re also very interested in being an integral part of the decision-making process. &quot; The proposal would have to be approved by the end of 1994 for scheduling to be completed by organizers in Nagano . NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman favors the idea , but the NHL Players Assn . is not enthusiastic -- especially since it wasn ' t invited to talks between Bettman and International Ice_Hockey Federation officials here last week . &quot; Personally , I don ' t like it at all , &quot; said former NHL defenseman Doug Wilson , who now works for the NHLPA . &quot; There are a lot of questions to be answered as it stands now. &quot; * U.S. goaltender Garth Snow backs the Dream Team idea and hopes he will be chosen for a second Olympic team . &quot; I ' d do_it again next year if there was another Olympics , &quot; he said . &quot; I just have to bust my butt_in the NHL to get_back here. &quot; After the Games , Snow is expected to rejoin the Quebec Nordiques . Fellow goalie Mike Dunham is awaiting word on whether he will report to the New Jersey Devils or their farm_club in Albany , N.Y. HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
