   <HEADLINE> BELGIAN FOREIGN_MINISTER CLAES PICKED TO HEAD NATO ; MILITARY : IF CONFIRMED , HE WILL BEGIN A FOUR-YEAR TERM AS THE ALLIANCE WORKS TO CARVE OUT A POST-COLD WAR ROLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ambassadors to the 16-member North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization on Monday selected Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes for the alliance ' s top job of secretary_general . The appointment of Claes , 55 , is expected to be confirmed later this week by NATO foreign_ministers , who are now in New York for the opening of the annual session of the U.N. General_Assembly . The selection , carried_out with little public_debate or controversy , constitutes a badly needed smooth , swift transition for the alliance as it searches for new direction in the post-Cold War era . Claes succeeds Manfred Woerner , who died Aug . 13 after a long battle with cancer . Although his name was mentioned among possible successors to Woerner virtually from the start , Claes is in many ways an unlikely figure for the job . Unlike Woerner , who trained as a jet pilot and spent several years as his country ' s defense minister before coming_to NATO , Claes ' background is in economics and foreign affairs . Indeed , he seems to have shown little interest in military matters . His Flemish Socialist_Party also actively opposed the controversial alliance decision to deploy medium-range cruise nuclear missiles in Belgium in the early 1980s . But diplomats involved in the selection process point to his strengths . &quot; He ' s a good Atlanticist , yet he also favors strengthening the European dimension of the alliance , &quot; commented one NATO diplomat . &quot; That combination is essential for our future. &quot; As a successful Belgian politician , he has a reputation more as a skilled consensus builder and a hard_worker than a visionary . He prefers to operate with discretion rather than in the limelight . Claes won praise for his handling of extremely delicate issues on the agenda during Belgium ' s six-month presidency of the European Union last year . He begins his four-year term at a time when the alliance is working to carve out a new role in the post-Cold War era . Created in 1949 to counter the Soviet threat to Western Europe , NATO is often called the most successful alliance in which the United States has ever participated . But with the collapse of the Berlin Wall five years ago , NATO ' s main mission of containing Communist expansion effectively ended in victory , placing its own future in doubt . Realizing this fact , Woerner quickly started moving the alliance into new areas , including peacekeeping outside member countries , and forging meaningful ties with its former enemies , including Russia . But these steps remain tentative and Claes is likely to be judged on his ability to turn them into fixtures that would guarantee the alliance ' s future . More immediately , Claes must try to ease tensions between the United States and key European partners on NATO ' s role in Bosnia-Herzegovina . The Clinton_Administration has pressed for more extensive use of alliance air_power to curb Bosnian Serb provocations . But European allies -- such_as France and Britain , which have forces on the ground in Bosnia -- see such a policy as reckless . Brussels researcher Isabelle Maelcamp contributed to this report .</TEXT>
