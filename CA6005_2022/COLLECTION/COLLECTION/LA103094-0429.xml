   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA ' S ELECTIONS ; STATEWIDE RACES ; SECRETARY OF STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THE OFFICE The Secretary_of_state is the state ' s chief elections officer , keeper of campaign and corporate records and a member of the state World Trade Commission . MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES BILL JONES , Republican * Born : Dec . 20 , 1949 , in Coalinga * Residence : Fresno * Current position : Assembly member , part-time businessman-farmer * Education : Bachelor ' s degree , Cal State Fresno * Career highlights : Fresno County Republican Central Committee chairman , 1975-76 ; Assembly member , 1982-present ; Assembly Republican leader , 1991-92 * Family : Married , 2 children * Background : During his 12 years representing the Fresno area in the Assembly , Jones has been a solidly conservative member of the Republican minority . But he has not been part of a doctrinaire inner_circle often dubbed &quot; the cavemen &quot; for their often take-no-prisoners approach to politics . When moderates in 1991 decided to oust the Assembly Republican leader , they turned_to the more genial Jones as his replacement . Jones lasted less than two years on_the_job , stepping_down after the Assembly lost two Republican seats in the 1992 elections . As an Assemblyman , Jones was the farmers ' best friend in the Legislature , often carrying measures protective of the agriculture industry and its use of pesticides . Like most of his fellow Republicans , he often took positions strongly opposed by environmental groups . Now he says that his generally pro-business , anti-regulation views have become mainstream , even in a Legislature dominated by Democrats . Jones ' biggest claim to legislative prominence came this year when he co-authored the &quot; three strikes &quot; crime measure that is now law.The legislation was the idea of Fresno resident Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was murdered in a 1992 robbery outside of a restaurant . * TONY MILLER , Democrat * Born : June 29 , 1948 , Westwood ( Lassen County ) * Residence : Pleasant Grove * Current position : Acting secretary_of_state * Education : Bachelor ' s degree , UC Davis ; law_degree , Boalt Hall , UC Berkeley * Career highlights : Member Fair Political Practices Commission , 1975-76 ; chief legal counsel , secretary_of_state ' s office , 1976-94 ; chief deputy secretary_of_state , 1981-1994 ; acting secretary_of_state , Feb . 1994-present . * Family : Unmarried * Background : Miller has spent the last 18 years -- the largest part of his professional_life -- working for Secretary_of_State March Fong Eu . Miller became acting secretary_of_state in February , when Eu stepped_down to become ambassador to Micronesia . Under Eu , Miller had broad responsibilities for the office , including administering fines for politicians , lobbyists and contributors who were late in filing required financial disclosure reports . Opponents have tried to tar him for Eu ' s longstanding practice of reducing or waiving many of the fines where the failures were &quot; non-willful , &quot; as permitted by a 1975 law . Over the years , as chief deputy , Miller spared violators millions of dollars in fines , but he says he was evenhanded , treating Democrats and Republicans alike . Miller takes some credit for many of Eu ' s achievements in office , including creation of the state World Trade Commission , registration by mail and voting by mail . As deputy secretary_of_state , Miller has shown new boldness . Though results were minimal , he urged lobbyists to register with his office to put candidates on notice not to solicit them for campaign contributions . For the first time , all statewide candidates were given free space in the ballot pamphlet sent_out to all registered voters . MINOR PARTY CANDIDATES * ISRAEL FEUER , Peace and Freedom , 64 , political organizer / educator * PEGGY CHRISTENSEN , Libertarian , 37 , technical consultant * MARGARET GARCIA , Green , 25 , writer / editor * DOROTHY KREISS ROBBINS , American Independent , 73 , writer / teacher The Issues VOTER FRAUD Republican Jones contends that California ' s voter rolls are filled with &quot; deadwood &quot; -- duplicate records for people who have moved to another county and ghost registrations for those who have moved to another state or died . He claims that they add_up to as much as 15 % of those registered , or 2 million people . He also contends that many non-citizens -- those here legally and illegally -- are_on the rolls and that unknown numbers are voting . The system , he says , is ripe for election_fraud . Democrat Miller contends that Jones has exaggerated the size and effect of the problem . Having deadwood on the registration rolls is not the same as casting fraudulent ballots , he says , and there is no evidence of significant fraud . MOTOR VOTER Whoever is secretary_of_state will oversee implementation of the new National Voter Registration Act -- called &quot; motor voter &quot; because it requires states to allow voters to register when they apply for driver ' s licenses or other government services . Democratic politicians generally like &quot; motor voter &quot; because it expands their voting pool , while Republicans argue that it is already easy enough for citizens to register . Miller promises to move ahead vigorously with the new law when it goes_into effect Jan . 1 . Jones says that unlike some Republicans , he is committed to expanding efforts to sign_up new voters . But fellow Republican Gov . Pete Wilson has ordered state agencies not to move ahead with motor voter unless the federal_government provides the money needed to put it into effect . If Wilson is reelected and sticks_by his executive order , Miller vows to take him to court on Jan . 2 . Jones has been ambiguous about what he would do , other_than talk to Wilson about his position . CAMPAIGN REFORM Both candidates want to end the accelerating campaign arms race by putting a limit on campaign contributions from individuals , corporations and political_action_committees . Jones wants to restore the contribution limits in Proposition 73 , a voter-approved initiative that was struck_down in the federal_courts . Miller wants to reimpose contribution limits but goes further -- calling_for spending limits for candidates as well . However , the U.S. Supreme Court has barred mandatory spending limits as a violation of the free speech rights of candidates , so limits must be voluntary . One way to get candidates in contested races to agree to limits is to offer them public funding as an inducement to accept a spending cap . Like Jones , Miller opposes using tax dollars for campaigns . Miller ' s alternative : Let candidates who agree to a spending cap take larger contributions than those who don ' t . For example , a candidate who agreed to limit spending could take_up to $ 1 # 000 from an individual , while a candidate who won ' t agree to a limit would be restricted to $ 100 . Oakland is experimenting with such a system . CORPORATE RECORDS The secretary_of_state ' s office is home for a host of corporate records . Jones faults Miller and his former boss , Eu , for problems the office had installing computerized systems , particularly for tracking commercial loans and liens under the Uniform Commercial Code . Access to those records is important to the availability of business loans in the state . Miller admits that the office ' s first attempt to computerize these records in 1989 was a failure , blaming a contractor that did not do the job . He says the office recovered the money that was paid to the contractor and hired a new one . The new system was fully installed this summer .</TEXT>
