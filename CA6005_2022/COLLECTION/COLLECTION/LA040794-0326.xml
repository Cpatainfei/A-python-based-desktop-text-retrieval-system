   <HEADLINE> CHINA URGED TO GIVE DETAILS OF HONG KONG REPORTER ' S ' SPYING '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Key China-appointed advisers from this British colony joined journalists and human_rights advocates Wednesday in urging the Chinese government to release details of the spying conviction of a Hong Kong journalist sentenced to 12 years in prison . In a telephone_interview , Tsang Yok-sing , a pro-China adviser and chairman of Hong Kong ' s main pro-Beijing party , said he asked China to provide evidence to prove that Xi Yang , a Chinese citizen who reports for Hong Kong ' s mainstream Chinese-language daily Ming Pao , did anything other_than to simply gather news . &quot; We have to find_out more about the facts of the case first , because many people , especially the people working for the media in Hong Kong , have argued that Mr. Xi Yang was not engaged in activities other_than normal news gathering , &quot; Tsang said . &quot; Now , if that ' s the case , then it is very serious because it certainly poses a threat to other Hong Kong journalists working both in Hong Kong and China in the future. &quot; China ' s recent press crackdown has added_to the already deep fears held by Hong Kong journalists about their freedom and job security after the_British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under a Sino-British agreement . Xi , 38 , was detained in September and charged with espionage for allegedly working with an employee of the People ' s Bank of China to obtain advance information about interest_rate changes and international gold transactions . The Beijing Intermediate Court said Monday that Xi had been found guilty of &quot; stealing and spying on state secrets &quot; and imposed a 12-year sentence . Tian Ye , an official at the People ' s Bank of China , was sentenced to 15 years in jail . Top_executives of Ming Pao said that a Chinese lawyer who had agreed to act for Xi when he appealed his 12-year sentence pulled_out of the case . &quot; This case has a chilling effect on Hong Kong journalists . . . and because of what happened to Xi Yang , journalists , in particular those who cover China news , are now self-censoring themselves , &quot; said Daisy Li , chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Assn . Meanwhile , police in China confirmed that they have detained a woman who worked for dissident Wei Jingsheng , news_agencies reported from Beijing . Tong Yi , who maintained close relations with the foreign press in Beijing , had been missing since Tuesday . Wei is back in custody for what authorities call &quot; new crimes. &quot;</TEXT>
