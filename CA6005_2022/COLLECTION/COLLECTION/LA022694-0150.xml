   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; NORWEGIANS CLEAN UP IN SKI_JUMPING ; SKI_JUMPING : COUNTRYMEN BREDESEN AND OTTESEN WIN GOLD AND SILVER MEDALS IN DREAM DOMINATION OF THE EVENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Espen Bredesen got_it almost exactly right the first time . Then the best ski_jumper in Norway improved on that , helping make Friday a day for the ages in Norwegian skiing history . Bredesen ' s two stylish jumps_off the normal hill gave him the gold medal , at the expense of teammate Lasse Ottesen , who wound_up with the silver . And those medals , thrown_in with the three won by Norwegians in the men ' s Alpine combined earlier in the day , had the crowd at the jumping hill singing the Norwegian victory song long into the afternoon , probably into evening and maybe into this morning . Bredesen had jumps of 329 feet 8 inches and 341-2 , a hill record , for 282 points . Ottesen jumped 336-3 and 321 , totaling 268 points . German Dieter Thoma was third , totaling 260 1 / 2 points on jumps of 323-1 and 336-3 . Bredesen had finished second to Thoma ' s teammate , Jens Weissflog , in the big-hill competition Sunday , but Norway was shut_out of the medals Tuesday in the team event , so the 1-2 finish of Bredesen and Ottesen was probably even more_than most Norwegians had hoped for . Not so Bredesen . &quot; I don ' t think I needed any inspiration but with the Norwegians doing so good in Alpine , I said to Lasse , ' Now we have to do something. ' &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve known for a long_time that Lasse is a very good skier and I hoped he could pull it off today. &quot; Ottesen not only pulled it off , he came_close to relegating Bredesen to second . Jumping midway through the first round , he launched himself into the longest_jump to that point , then sat_back and waited , watching the other top guns -- Thoma , Andreas Goldberger of Austria , Weissflog , even Bredesen -- all fail to beat it . Ottesen , however , had been antsy in the air and when Bredesen jumped , the difference was obvious to observers and judges . Although his jump was shorter , Bredesen kept his body still in the air and moved_into the lead_on style points . He wasn ' t happy , though , to have been outdistanced . &quot; The first jump was good but not perfect , &quot; Bredesen said . &quot; I was a little late on the takeoff and figured I could do better. &quot; And so he did . Jumping last in the second round , right behind Ottesen , he needed near perfection , knew it and got_it . &quot; I was much more aggressive , &quot; he said . &quot; I got more height. &quot; He also got the distance he was looking_for , even forcing himself to cut the jump a bit short for fear of overshooting the landing area . &quot; I could have had a_few more meters but I was afraid I was too high , &quot; he said . &quot; I felt when I jumped that it was going_to be a good one . When you hit a good jump , you know it . The feeling is just incredible . Everything is just perfect. &quot; Weissflog , who had outjumped a leading Bredesen in the second round for the gold medal on the big hill Sunday , had two good jumps but made an untidy landing the first time around , then failed to get high enough on his second jump and finished fourth . &quot; Up_on the_hill before the last jump , I was saying to myself , ' Don ' t do the same thing again ( as on Sunday ) , ' &quot; Bredesen said . And when he nailed the second jump , Norway had finished first and second in Olympic jumping competition for the first time since the ' 52 Games at Oslo . &quot; that ' s great , &quot; Bredesen said . &quot; Lasse pulled_off a very good jump and I did , too , and everything is terrific. &quot;</TEXT>
