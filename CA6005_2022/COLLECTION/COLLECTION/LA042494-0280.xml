   <HEADLINE> FROM BEGINNING TO END , NIXON WAS A FIGHTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Nixon ' s election to the presidency in November , 1968 , was the capstone to one of the country ' s most turbulent postwar years . Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr . had been slain in Memphis , Tenn. , and riots swept the country . Weeks later , Sen . Robert F . Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles . North Vietnam ' s Tet offensive had crystallized political revulsion about the war , and Lyndon B . Johnson , in_effect , had been driven from the White_House . Every month something new set the country on edge . An American spy ship , the Pueblo , was captured off North_Korea ; its crew was thrown into prison . A B-52 bomber with nuclear_weapons aboard crashed in the Arctic . Democrats nominated Hubert H . Humphrey amid anarchy in the streets of Chicago , and he ran a campaign crippled by Johnson and the war and complicated by the angry presence of Alabama Gov . George C . Wallace stealing off with disaffected blue-collar voters . From this yearlong maelstrom , Nixon emerged with a plurality of 43.4 % to become one of the most durable and controversial American political_leaders of the 20th Century . Never had there been a more astonishing turnaround . It was the resurrection of a man who had spent six years in political purgatory . He emerged from the chaos of 1968 , political analyst Jules Witcover wrote , because his objective was survival : &quot; Through all_the year ' s turbulent events , he had not sought enlightenment , not discourse , not public adulation , but survival . Over the previous six years , he had been like a soldier in combat whose only goal is not to be a daring hero , but to be alive when the battle is over. &quot; That was the way it was for Nixon to the end . The man who entered politics when anti-communist fervor was at its peak died still battling to survive the taint of the Watergate scandal that drove him from the White_House nearly 20 years ago . He had taken the public posture of an elder_statesman , traveling the world , writing and advising his successors , but to the end he was fighting to regain his impounded presidential papers and control the tape_recordings that had helped humiliate him and bring him to the brink of impeachment before he quit . It was doggedness and determination that made him a survivor in spite of a personality that seemed ill-suited to retail politics . Nixon was , friends note , basically a shy man , who never really enjoyed meeting new people . He detested confrontations with colleagues or disagreements with people who worked for him . He preferred to make his decisions in solitude on the basis of memoranda written for him rather than haggling over them or searching for a consensus . Try as he did , he could never develop a common_touch that put his constituents at_ease . He was said to carefully rehearse little jokes and asides that he wanted to use to lighten conversations , but often he still came_off as uncomfortable and awkward . More_than once , he was photographed walking on the beach in shiny , leather shoes . He was seen in coat and tie hitting golf_shots at his San Clemente estate . Once when he stopped to console a motorcycle officer hurt in a motorcade accident , his only comment was to ask the suffering man whether he liked his job . But he never ceased trying to be down to earth . As the Watergate scandal wound to a conclusion , he went_to Nashville ' s Grand Ole Opry , where , surrounded by country_music entertainers , he played with a yo-yo and banged_out &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; to his wife on a piano . Like Johnson , he was at times maudlin about his humble beginnings and somewhat haunted by the glamour , star quality and adoring press coverage that surrounded the Kennedys . Even after all_of his years in Washington , he was uncomfortable with what he regarded_as the capital ' s social and intellectual Establishment based in Georgetown . His feelings were understandable . W . Averell Harriman , the New York multimillionaire who served in high diplomatic posts in the Franklin D . Roosevelt , Harry S . Truman , John F . Kennedy and Johnson administrations , once threatened to walk_out_of a Georgetown dinner_party when then-Sen . Nixon arrived and ignored him after the guests were seated . There were slights , real or imagined , even at the hands of Dwight D . Eisenhower . Once asked to describe Nixon ' s contributions as vice_president , Eisenhower made his famous offhand remark that he would need some time to think_of something . Nixon was said to have been hurt on another occasion at an outdoor affair at Eisenhower ' s Gettysburg estate . After it was over , Eisenhower invited his more important guests inside , but Nixon was left standing on the lawn . So Nixon fashioned himself a political gut fighter from the beginning , and he made enemies early -- when he labeled U.S. Rep . Jerry Voorhis a communist dupe , and when , in his race for the Senate , he snidely referred to Helen Gahagan Douglas as the &quot; pink lady. &quot; But his fights helped define him as a man of courage . In his famous &quot; Checkers &quot; speech in 1952 , he saved his place on the Republican ticket . As vice_president , he courageously faced an anti-American mob in Venezuela and held his own in a tit-for-tat &quot; kitchen debate &quot; with Nikita S . Khrushchev in Moscow . Nixon ' s election in 1968 completed a long comeback from the ugly and graceless -- &quot; You won ' t have Nixon to kick_around anymore &quot; -- scene after his loss in the 1962 California gubernatorial race . That was just two years after he had lost to Kennedy in the race for the White_House . The astonishing turnaround had seen Nixon leave California for New York , considering his political career ended . He had no political base , no organization and no prospects . But the assassination of John Kennedy and Barry Goldwater ' s disastrous loss to Johnson in 1964 opened the door once more . The 1968 campaign , run with clockwork efficiency and tactical and public relations genius , brought Nixon to the White_House with an appeal_to the &quot; silent majority &quot; and with an unexplained plan to end the Vietnam_War . Four years later , with the Democrats still waging fratricidal conflict , Nixon easily won again . Not only had he been a fighter , he had been lucky . He had smoothly transformed himself from a redbaiter into a tireless advocate of international discourse . Fiercely partisan and conservative at_home , he was politically liberated in foreign_policy . Unlike Kennedy and Johnson , he was free to make his historic opening to China and to conclude the first strategic arms agreement with the Soviet_Union without fear of retribution . But he remained the extraordinary political partisan , a man who seemed to need enemies . And he had them aplenty , no matter how successfully he modernized himself on issues . More_than any other Republican , he was loathed by mainline Democrats , who remembered him from his days in Congress , his attacks on Voorhis and Douglas and his work_on the House Un-American Activities Committee . From the day he first captured attention as a biting anti-communist , he was an easy_mark for caricaturists , with his bushy eyebrows , five o ' clock shadow and jowls that shook when he delivered an oration . Washington Post cartoonist Herblock delighted in drawing Nixon emerging from a sewer ; comedians parodied his habit of over-dramatizing every development on the horizon , and critics kept alive the unshakable appellation Tricky Dick . Although he had been vice_president for eight years , Nixon , as President , was in spirit still an outsider . He surrounded himself with young aides who had little political experience and boundless personal loyalty . They shared Nixon ' s perception of patriotism , revulsion about long-haired anti-war demonstrators and contempt for officials who leaked stories to the press . The Watergate story that unfolded before Congress and in courtrooms in 1973 was not just the tale of an inept attempt to burglarize the political opposition , but the story of Richard Nixon . No one ever in American politics had ever traveled such peaks and valleys . His imprint was upon some of the great events of his time . But less than six years after fighting his way back from oblivion , his Administration was disgraced by burglaries being committed , telephones tapped , political enemies listed for possible retribution -- and , in the end , the only resignation of an American President . In the hours after he announced his resignation , Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White_House was filled with automobiles , horns honking in celebration . Watergate had become a national pastime . But once Nixon ' s knowledge of the cover-up had become clear , the anger directed at him was deep , deep enough that Gerald R . Ford would lose the presidency two years later because he granted Nixon a blanket pardon . For nearly 20 years before his death , Nixon waged a last battle to overcome the sorry end of his Presidency . In some measure , he succeeded . He assumed the posture of elder_statesman , traveling the world and writing_on foreign_policy . He counseled not only Ford , Ronald Reagan and George_Bush , but also Bill_Clinton . And shortly after his death Friday night , the incumbent called him &quot; a statesman who sought to build a structure of peace. &quot; True . But he will always be the first President forced to resign from office , named as an unindicted participant in a criminal conspiracy . And he will always be an enigma . He was , Henry A . Kissinger wrote , &quot; a strange mixture of calculation , deviousness , idealism , tenderness , tawdriness , courage and daring , &quot; a man who wanted in the end to be remembered for his idealism .</TEXT>
