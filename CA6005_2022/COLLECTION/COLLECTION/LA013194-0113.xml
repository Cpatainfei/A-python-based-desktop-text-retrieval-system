   <TEXT> Federal_officials vowed Sunday to crack_down on fraud in emergency food_stamp and disaster relief programs , the day after five men were arrested on suspicion of illegally buying_food stamps from quake victims outside a South-Central Los Angeles assistance center . &quot; We had identified rather large-scale trafficking going_on there , &quot; said Dave Dickson , regional inspector_general for the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture , which administers the food_stamp program . &quot; We will not tolerate this action anywhere in Los Angeles. &quot; Quake victims leaving the food_stamp distribution center were approached by men offering cash for food_stamps , usually half the face_value , Dickson said . Dickson believes the five may have had a tie-in with an unidentified small retailer who would redeem the coupons for full face_value . He said officials want to discourage food_stamps from &quot; becoming a second currency on the street &quot; in the aftermath of the earthquake . By Friday afternoon , more_than $ 25.4 million in emergency food_stamps had been approved for quake-affected areas . More_than 112 # 000 individuals had applied for emergency food_stamps through Saturday , when reports of double-dipping and padding of claims prompted officials to close_down the application process for a day . More_than 90 # 000 applications had been approved by Saturday afternoon , the same day federal and county officials imposed a three-day waiting period between applying for and receiving food_stamps . It was the first of several mechanisms to screen_out unqualified applicants . After the quake , the county had lifted its food_stamp screening procedures to speed help to quake victims . But a flood of false and inflated claims prompted officials to impose the waiting period and heighten scrutiny of applications . A special computer_system began operating Sunday to screen_out fraudulent or duplicate applications . Even before that , a total of 2 # 168 applications had been rejected The five men arrested are to be arraigned today in federal_court on charges of unlawful acquisition and possession of food_stamps . If convicted , they face maximum penalties of five years in prison and $ 250 # 000 in fines . When they were taken into custody by USDA investigators and LAPD officers , the men had about $ 5 # 000 in food_stamps and $ 2 # 500 in cash , Dickson said . Five others were questioned and released . Bill Ludwig , administrator of USDA ' s Food and Nutrition Services , said the agency intends to do whatever is necessary to &quot; ensure that emergency food_stamps only go_to eligible people. &quot; Emergency food_stamp offices are expected to reopen today at 7 a.m. , but the number of sites has been reduced from 29 to 16 to help law_enforcement consolidate its crowd_control . Scuffles broke_out at several sites last week where lines of more_than 1 # 000 people waited for hours to get the food coupons . To make_up for the closed sites , four large centers will be opened at Dodger Stadium , Whittier Narrows Recreation Area , Victoria Park in Carson and the county building in Commerce . Officials emphasized that only low-income people who suffered such earthquake losses as residential damage or power_failures that spoiled food are eligible . A family of four which meets those criteria and certain income limits can receive up_to $ 375 in food_stamps . USDA officials asked_for the public ' s help in reporting any suspected food_stamp fraud through a toll-free number , ( 800 ) 424-9121 . Citing experience in previous natural disasters , officials from other federal agencies pledged to be vigilant in checking other earthquake relief applications to ensure that only those affected by the quake and in need will receive aid . Several hundred investigators from a number of federal agencies are working throughout the quake-affected areas . James Lee Witt , director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , said more_than 208 # 000 applications for disaster assistance have been received since the 6.6-magnitude quake Jan . 17 . FEMA officials intend to search for duplicate applications , verify the occupancy and ownership of damaged buildings , and double-check the scope of property damage . John Carey , the agency ' s general counsel , said FEMA will pursue all allegations of fraud and abuse received through its special toll-free phone_number , ( 800 ) 323-8603 . Those who have filed a claim and later found that the loss is less or greater than estimated should call ( 800 ) 462-1069 . Representatives of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said they are watching for evidence of post-quake rent gouging , but have not seen any yet . HUD teams will also be checking for racial discrimination in housing . Officials were heartened Sunday that the number of people living_in emergency shelters and tent cities dropped to about 4 # 800 despite a magnitude 5.0 aftershock early Saturday . &quot; The tents are going_down , &quot; Witt said . &quot; People are starting to realize that aftershocks are a very normal part of what happens after a major earthquake , &quot; said Paul Flores , deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services . Quake victims in the Fillmore area of Ventura County will be offered emergency housing in trailers because of the lack of other housing in their towns , Witt said . Two more FEMA disaster assistance centers are to open today at Coast Federal Bank , 18000 Chatsworth St. , Northridge , and at William S . Hart Park , 24151 N . Newhall Ave. , Newhall . As the region enters its third week of coping_with crippled freeways , Caltrans officials said traffic should move more smoothly today around damaged portions of the Golden State Freeway ( Interstate 5 ) in the San Fernando Valley , thanks to a new 2 1 / 2-mile detour along The Old Road from Weldon Canyon Road to Calgrove Boulevard . In addition , two southbound lanes connecting the Antelope Valley Freeway ( California 14 ) to I-5 reopened Friday . Meanwhile , a new Metrolink station set to open today south of Palmdale is the first in a series of train and bus improvements in the works for the coming months -- including an ambitious plan to link the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys to the West San Fernando Valley with Metrolink service . The Vincent Grade / Acton station is little more_than a large parking_lot with two long boarding platforms . But officials say that because it is closer to Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley areas than either the Lancaster or Palmdale stations that opened a week ago , it will save commuting time for south Antelope Valley residents . Other upgrades are expected in the next several weeks : * Next Monday , two Metrolink train_stations are slated to be opened -- one in Canyon Country on Via Princessa , the other in Northridge at Parthenia Street and Wilbur Avenue -- and a third train will be added each weekday to the Antelope Valley . * On Feb . 14 or 21 , Metrolink officials hope to open another station in Camarillo , extending the Ventura County train line terminus about 13 miles . * By the end of February , Metrolink executive_director Richard Stanger said , the agency hopes to have developed a train connection allowing passengers to transfer from north county_lines to trains heading for the West San Fernando Valley . In other developments , rebuilding work began on the collapsed Gavin Canyon bridge on the Golden State Freeway near Santa Clarita , meaning that the freeway route should be open before summer , Caltrans officials said . A bypass is now being used . Times staff writer John Chandler contributed to this story .</TEXT>
