   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON TRADE ; EUROPE DRAWS AN ELECTRONIC CURTAIN ; BARRIERS TO U.S. FILMS , TV TO PROTECT CULTURE CAST AN OMINOUS SHADOW ON THE EMERGING GLOBAL INFORMATION HIGHWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After seven tortuous years , Congress has four months to sort through the pile of compromises and issues shoved under the rug in reaching the 11th-hour closure on the Uruguay Round of GATT ( the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) . Sticky sectors such_as agriculture , textiles and financial services involving some of Congress ' own pet subsidies and trade_barriers can be tidied_up relatively quickly with interpretations that suit the national interest . But no amount of housekeeping is going_to smooth_over the lump of audio-visual issues -- movies , television , popular_music -- that the Europeans exempted from the most liberalizing trade agreement in history . The Clinton_Administration was right not to settle for a bad compromise in what the Department_of_Commerce calculates as America ' s second-largest net export earner . But neither the Administration nor Congress can afford to let Brussels sweep the so-called audio-visual issues under the trade carpet for very long . If Europe ' s audio-visual policies were a simple matter of preserving &quot; culture &quot; or even subsidizing it , few would begrudge their behavior . Virtually every nation , including the United States , uses government funds to promote or preserve elements of culture through the audio-visual arts . However , under the terms of the European Union ' s ( formerly the European Community ) broadcast directive , countries are required to implement a timetable for policing and restricting &quot; where practicable &quot; the showing of programs with less than a majority &quot; European content &quot; in production , talent or locations . This leaves the EU bureaucrats in Brussels having to defend an Italian clone of &quot; Wheel of Fortune &quot; as preserving European culture while they block &quot; Amadeus &quot; as part of the Hollywood cultural invasion . The reasoning ? Despite the clearly European focus of the award-winning fantasy about Mozart , its funding was not primarily European . Until recently , only the_French were aggressive enforcers of the restrictions on U.S. entertainment . Indeed , the millions of francs they fined the very popular independent TV channel ( Canal Cinq ) for showing too many American programs was in large measure the reason for its sudden demise . On the heels of the GATT agreement , France has now ordered that 40 % of the music aired on French radio_stations be French in origin , the other 60 % European . So_much for Cole Porter . . . . Even less restrictive countries such_as the United Kingdom and Germany are scrambling to demonstrate that they are taking specific actions to restrict U.S. programming in preparation for October ' s five-year review of implementation of the 1989 broadcast directive . The long-term stakes in audio-visual policies are much higher than the very considerable trade interests of our television , film and record industries . First of all , technical advances in digitalization and signal compression are fast turning film , video and sound into the &quot; software &quot; that feeds not only traditional TV and movie fare but also the exploding markets in computer , telecommunication , cable and satellite industries -- industries that are becoming critical conduits to competitiveness in developing as well as developed countries . If cultural sovereignty can be used by governments to restrict trade_in entertainment , this same principle can be used to restrict and therefore manage information in all its forms . To limit their tradability under the guise of cultural sovereignty casts a potentially long shadow over global free_trade extending far beyond America ' s own economic self-interest . Perhaps more important in the long_run than multi-industry economic stakes are the basic political principles involved . The citizens of Europe and others whose governments attempt to restrict access to audio-visual services are being denied basic rights and freedom of choice . Indeed , the EU broadcast directive is in direct violation of basic tenets adopted by all member countries in the founding days of the United Nations ( and later reaffirmed in the Convention of Europe ) . Article 19 of the U.N. Declaration of Human_Rights not only accepts the basic human &quot; right to freedom of opinion and expression &quot; but explicitly states : &quot; This right includes the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers. &quot; Most citizens of Europe undoubtedly would recoil at the thought that they have allowed their governments to promote what is tantamount_to economic &quot; jamming. &quot; Unlike the Soviet electronic_jamming of the Cold_War era , which attempted to block news and information broadcast from the West , the Europeans are &quot; jamming &quot; the airwaves with trade and regulatory restrictions . With more_than 30 countries in other parts of the world agreeing to some form of liberalization in audio-visual trade , even the powerful Hollywood lobby is likely to support congressional approval despite the failure in reaching agreement with Europe . But given the Clinton_Administration ' s avowed commitment to promoting both human_rights and economic competitiveness , it cannot afford to merely come_home and declare victory . It must commence a strategy that will engage the governments of Europe in recognizing that the rights of their citizens to information and ideas are as precious as any trade agreement in_advancing global prosperity and growth .</TEXT>
