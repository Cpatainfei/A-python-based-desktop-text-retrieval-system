   <HEADLINE> U.S. AIR_FORCE TURNS B-52 BOMBERS INTO SCRAP METAL ; ARIZONA : TO CARRY_OUT AN INTERNATIONAL ARMS TREATY , AMERICA IS DISMANTLING THE PLANES THAT WERE ONCE THE BACKBONE OF ITS NUCLEAR ARSENAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You ' ve probably seen the Veg-O-Matic vegetable chopper advertised for years , and maybe the Ginsu miracle knife . But there ' s nothing like the Air_Force &quot; scrapomatic. &quot; It turns a B-52 bomber into 100 # 000 pounds of scrap metal with the drop of a blade . It ' s a 13 # 000-pound guillotine blade hoisted by a crane , and it carries_out the dictates of an international arms treaty requiring the United States to destroy some of its systems for attacking with nuclear_weapons . For more_than 30 years , the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress was the backbone of America ' s nuclear arsenal . The eight-engine , long-range bomber was capable of flying thousands of miles , refueling in midair , to drop nuclear_warheads or conventional bombs . It played a key role in the Vietnam_War . Many of the aircraft , built between 1955 and 1962 , were brought_to the desert here years ago , obsolete and destined for the scrap heap anyway . Some models , modified to carry air-launched cruise missiles , remain in_operation . * But 365 of the jets are doomed under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia and other successor states of the Soviet_Union . It takes about 300 hours to prepare a plane for destruction , logistics management specialist Carl Mlodzik explained before a recent session . The B-52s are stripped of their engines and other reusable parts , and radiation and hazardous fluids are removed , he said . Then a 120-foot tall crane brings over the guillotine , attached by cables , to drop the blade about 80 feet . More_than a dozen airmen watched as the blade went_to work_on one day ' s task : Destruction of two B-52Ds , Nos . 50073 and 50070 . The first slice cut_across the tail section of 50073 , severing the fuselage . The treaty allows 60 days from the first chop to finish the job , but the crew does the chore in a day . It took seven drops of the guillotine to cut the fuselage of 50070 into three pieces and sever both wings . The nose almost rolled_over at the last cut , but stayed upright . * &quot; It ' s pretty impressive . You don ' t get_to see an airplane destroyed very often , &quot; said Tech . Sgt . Richard Foster , a sheet-metal worker for 16 years . &quot; History , &quot; said Tech . Sgt . Ken F . Prince . Since August 1993 , 177 B-52s have been turned_into junk metal . The other 188 are lined_up on the desert at this base in Tucson , at the Aerospace and Maintenance Regeneration Center . They ' re to be destroyed over the next two years . The planes are being destroyed at the rate of three a week . More_than 100 lie chopped_up in heaps on the desert floor . Under the treaty , which Ukraine hasn ' t ratified yet , the hulks must stay_in_place for 90 days to allow satellite verification . Then they can be hauled_off for scrap , said Master Sgt . Sam Haney , a base spokesman . At 20 cents a pound , each scrapped B-52 earns the Air_Force about $ 20 # 000 .</TEXT>
