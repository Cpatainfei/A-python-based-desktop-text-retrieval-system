   <HEADLINE> PESTICIDE WAR CEASE-FIRE ; EPA AGREEMENT COULD OPEN_DOOR TO KEY LEGISLATIVE REFORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Congress passed it 36 years ago , the Delaney clause of the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act seemed a good way to protect foods from carcinogens . It imposed a very strict standard , prohibiting in processed foods even the smallest trace of any pesticide believed to cause cancer , no matter how tiny the risk . But today the law is outdated . It fails to address possible nerve damage and reproductive disorders caused by pesticides , imposes an impossibly strict standard on carcinogens and does not affect fresh_foods . And it applies differently when it comes_to food_additives and colorings . Clearly the federal patchwork of food safety laws needs a thorough updating and overhaul . However , bills to do that have been frozen in Congress because it has been impossible for environmental groups to compromise with the agricultural and chemical_industries . We now have reason to unclog the logjam . Last Wednesday the Environmental Protection Agency reached agreement with the Natural_Resources Defense Council and unions representing farm_workers to enforce a strict interpretation of Delaney , using zero risk rather an &quot; negligible &quot; risk . That could affect up_to 85 pesticides , probably banning 36 chemicals within two years . The agreement allows_for the orderly phasing out of the most toxic pesticides , and further testing of others . No massive disruption of farming or food supplies is expected . This offers a valuable pause in the pesticide wars . Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) has proposed eliminating the Delaney clause in exchange for a single health standard for pesticides , food_additives and colorings . A competing industry bill would also terminate Delaney but would balance the health risks of pesticides against their economic benefits in crop yields . If nothing else , all sides agree that last week ' s EPA action may finally precipitate action in Congress . We are not now taking sides on the question . But when the new Congress convenes in January , it should resolve this overdue issue , using the latest medical , scientific and economic data .</TEXT>
