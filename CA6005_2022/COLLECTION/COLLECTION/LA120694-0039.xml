   <HEADLINE> MARKET SCENE ; GERMANY SLIPS ON BANANAS ; IT LOST A FIGHT WITH EUROPEAN UNION OVER QUOTAS BUT HASN ' T GIVEN UP HOPE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A banana is not a banana is not a banana . To Germans , there are big , beautiful , tasty Latin_American bananas , and there are all other bananas -- inferior fruit from anywhere but Latin_America . Among the world ' s biggest banana enthusiasts , Germans put_up a hard fight over the past year to prevent the European Union from setting quotas and tariffs on Latin_American bananas in favor of those from the few banana-producing countries of southern Europe and from former tropical colonies of the_French and British_empires . But they lost . The prices of the tariff-laden Latin bananas have skyrocketed and sales have plummeted . Now German importers and consumers are looking_to the United States to reopen doors to Latin_America ' s luscious fruit . It was , after all , popularized in Germany by American GIs after World_War_II . &quot; We are paying_for the old colonial burdens of Paris and London , &quot; Ulrich Boysen , a spokesman for the Federal Council of German Fruit Traders , said of the high-priced bananas now coming_into Europe . &quot; We lost in the EU . Now we hope to have the support of the U.S. government. &quot; Their hopes are pinned in part on a trade action filed by an American firm , Chiquita Brands International of Cincinnati , which markets &quot; dollar bananas , &quot; as the Latin fruits are called because most of them are marketed by American corporations . Chiquita filed a complaint with the U.S. Trade Representative ' s office , which launched an investigation into the European Union ' s banana import scheme in October . Chiquita says its European sales have dropped 50 % since the European import rules were imposed in 1993 , and it has been joined in the complaint by the Hawaii Banana Industry Assn. , which claims to be suffering from a glut of Latin_American bananas on the U.S. market . They had been bound for Europe , but the tariff wall there sent them flooding to America instead and driving down prices for the domestic Hawaiian product , according to a Chiquita spokesman . There was a time when European_countries bought bananas where they pleased . France and Spain generally grew their own in Martinique , Guadeloupe and the Canary Islands ; Britain and Portugal bought theirs from former colonies , while the Germans bought about 95 % of theirs from Latin_America , where the fruit was consistently sweet and cheap . The Germans had no tariffs on bananas . But in 1993 , national import rules were replaced by a general scheme for all_of Europe as part of the region ' s move toward a single market . The new rules give preferential access to &quot; home-grown &quot; fruit from EU countries and the former colonies of Britain and France in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific , the so-called ACP areas , while placing a tariff on the Latin &quot; dollar bananas. &quot; Despite the barrier , a majority of Europe ' s bananas still come from Latin_America , although in the teeth of a stepped tariff . The European banana regime allows 2 million tons of the Latin_American product into the market each year , at a tariff of $ 122 a ton . Any imports above that face a tariff of $ 1 # 037 a ton . The tariff gate is set_aside for 643 # 000 tons from EU countries and 666 # 000 tons from ACP countries . The General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade treaty , yet to be implemented , permits slightly more Latin bananas to be imported by Europeans -- 2.1 million tons . In a special case for this year , the European Union allotment was increased to 2.17 million tons after Hurricane Debbie destroyed crops in the Windward Islands and French Antilles . Meanwhile , the EU in Brussels redistributed import licenses , with about 66.5 % reserved for traders who have done business in Latin_American bananas , 30 % for traders of EU and ACP bananas and 3.5 % to newcomers . In the scramble to acquire newcomers ' licenses , Germans applied in the names of their grandmothers , children and even dogs . The EU Farm Commission argues that its tariff regime is a fair balance of the often competing interests of EU producers and consumers and of ACP and Latin_American producers . Germany and Chiquita -- and possibly the U.S._government -- disagree , saying the regime flies in the face of free_trade . &quot; Plenty of people are upset by this whole_thing , &quot; said Joe Hagin , vice_president of corporate affairs at Chiquita . &quot; A lot of attention has been paid to German opposition , but the Benelux countries and Denmark are ( also ) opposed , and the Italians are less than enamored with the regulations. &quot; &quot; The scheme , &quot; added a U.S. trade official who declined to be identified , &quot; is very , very damaging to these ( Latin_American ) countries ' interests and to American interests . They ( the EU ) are trying to protect former colonies and promote marketing in certain European_countries . Well , that is not what GATT is all about. &quot; If the U.S._government determines that the rules are discriminatory , various options are open , including taking the case to the World Trade Organization , which will succeed GATT next year . The Germans challenged the market regime in the European Court of Justice , but lost their case when the court endorsed the EU rules_in October . Boysen , of the German fruit traders council , said German prices for bananas have gone_up 40 % to 50 % in the last two years and , consequently , sales have dropped_by 50 % since 1992 . Bananas , which cost about 59 cents a pound in the United States , sell for between $ 1.06 and $ 1.21 a pound in Germany .</TEXT>
