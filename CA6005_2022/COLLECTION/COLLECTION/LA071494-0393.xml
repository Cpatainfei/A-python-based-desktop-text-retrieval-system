   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; COMMENTARY ; BEHIND THE SCENES , NOT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN A SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four years ago , a wink on the World Cup time line , West Germany won the Cup and returned in triumph to a country that began to clamor for something else . They had won the World Cup , now they wanted the World Cup . At the time , it was hardly_a secret that the American organizational efforts , begun in 1988 after FIFA had awarded the United States the 1994 World Cup_finals , had been sluggish at best . The one contract landed by the organizers -- a TV deal -- had been rejected by FIFA . There was a real concern that the United States , which had been so successful with the 1984 Olympic Games and other major events , would fail to adequately organize the World Cup . Other countries were suggested as alternates . Something had to be done . With FIFA working behind the scenes , Los Angeles attorney Alan Rothenberg was elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and became head of the World Cup Organizing Committee . He impressed FIFA with his energy and sophistication and promised to put_on the best World Cup ever and leave a legacy for soccer in the United States . With 50 games having been played in nine U.S. cities , after a record heat_wave and record attendance , how will the organization of this World Cup be judged ? The Germans , who so coveted the event four years ago , appear pleased . Egidius Braun , president of the German soccer federation , had nothing but praise . &quot; It ' s a sensation , &quot; he said . &quot; It will be very difficult for any other country in the world to do_it the same way in the future . It can ' t be better. &quot; From the perspective of the participating teams , the tournament will be viewed_as one of the best . The estimated economic impact of the World Cup in the United States is $ 4 billion , with a projected $ 623 million generated in Los Angeles . Rothenberg has estimated that the World Cup , whose budget has never been disclosed , will generate a $ 20-million profit . By most accounts , the organization of the World Cup has been excellent . The biggest potential nightmare -- hooliganism -- was averted when England failed to qualify . Security , although present at a_level most American sports fans find uncomfortable , has been effective and successful in heading_off problems . Concerns about fans ' overzealous celebrations outside the stadiums haven ' t been borne_out , either , even though Americans seem to have caught World Cup fever to a degree that few would have predicted . Attendance is at an all-time high and the nearly full stands are a welcome departure from the sparse crowds in Italy in 1990 . Also unlike Italy , no new stadiums had to be built . If the nine World Cup stadiums aren ' t specifically soccer-friendly , they are more_than adequate . Memories inexorably linked to this World Cup are of the murder , in his own country , of Colombian player Andres Escobar , and of the incredible heat that rendered playing conditions inhumane through much of the first round . Neither factor was under the control of World Cup organizers . But behind the festive scenes , there have been some problems . Sponsors , fans , the media and others report awful interaction with World Cup officials , who are perceived as arrogant and greedy . They represent the United States to the rest of the world and are charged with maintaining any interest the World Cup generates . A legacy of ill_will ? Nye Lavalle , chairman of the Dallas-based Sports Marketing Group , told the San Jose Mercury News that the World Cup organizers ' abrasive style will not soon be forgotten . &quot; They have burned bridges beyond recognition , &quot; he said . &quot; A lot of people don ' t want to work with them anymore . When you start alienating key constituencies , how much support can you get for your efforts in the future ? &quot; Among the problems : * Tickets . Easily the most widespread ill_will has been generated by the botched handling of some of the World Cup tickets . The first ticket offering was to the &quot; soccer family , &quot; including fans who had written or called World Cup seeking tickets . They were offered tickets at a discount , as_many as 10 strips . A deadline date was announced and the prospective buyers were told all orders would be processed , that it would not be a matter of first come , first served . But the World Cup Organizing Committee vastly underestimated demand , and the program quickly became oversubscribed . The promise that all orders would be honored was not kept . It was first come , first served . Rothenberg ' s response was that this indicated interest in the games and was the kind of problem that the World Cup wanted . There were many_more . The high-end Premiere Ticket program was mishandled , and at one point orders worth more_than $ 40 million were backlogged . When it was time , in early June , to send tickets to the fans , that was bungled too . Some never received their tickets . Some asked_for tickets to games in Chicago and got tickets to games in Detroit . Some asked_for two seats together and got one on one side of the stadium , one on the other . The most common complaint was from fans who had bought Category I tickets and found themselves behind the goals . In at least one case , legal_action has been taken . A class-action lawsuit in Chicago is seeking a multimillion-dollar judgment from the WCOC on behalf of fans around the country who believe they were ripped_off . Then came the final indignity . Travel_agents and tour operators , who paid a 20 % surcharge for tickets and a licensing_fee , looked_on in horror as World Cup flooded the market with cheap tickets . * Sponsors . Sponsors of events the size of the World Cup pay millions of dollars for the right to use the official logo and reach a vast audience . Most companies believe the money they spend on the event also buys them a certain deference from the World Cup organizers -- or , at least , the sense that they too are &quot; on the World Cup team. &quot; Sources say that domestic sponsors signed by the WCOC and international sponsors , who made their deals with FIFA ' s marketing agent , are annoyed with what is described as the WCOC ' s arrogant and abrasive attitude in dealing with company higher-ups . Some World Cup sponsors are angry not only with the organizing committee but with each other . No company spokesman was willing to speak on the record , but McDonald ' s and electronics giant JVC are particularly miffed . Both contractually agreed to supply a certain number of meals and televisions to WCOC , and in both cases the organizing committee went_back and asked_for more . In the case of two other sponsors , MasterCard and Sprint , a lawsuit included the WCOC . MasterCard paid about $ 20 million to be the official credit_card , then Sprint paid about $ 10 million to be the official telephone charge_card . MasterCard believed the same rights had been sold twice . A U.S. District judge agreed . The entire World Cup promotional effort benefited from the performance of the U.S. team . No one loves a bandwagon more_than the American public , unless it ' s the American media . The excitement generated by the U.S. team ' s advance to the second round propelled the World Cup into living rooms and bars where the sport had never been considered . What promotional effort was made by World Cup ? Some sponsors have griped that rather than spending the millions it takes_to promote its own event , the WCOC instead piggy-backed off the advertising and marketing campaigns of its sponsors and relied_on them to raise public awareness . The World Cup newspaper advertising that did run was provided on a trade-out basis with major newspapers that were regional sponsors , such_as the Los Angeles Times . * Accommodations . There has been price gouging by the World Cup Accommodation Bureau , the contractor awarded the right to sell hotel packages to fans and journalists . There also was a problem with overbooking . About 50 % of the rooms blocked for World Cup were released back to the hotels when it became clear that tourism surrounding the event was not going_to be at the level projected by World Cup . Additionally , hotels complained that the Accommodation Bureau was charging guests rates that were far too high . &quot; It looks_like greed and smells like greed , &quot; said Roland Baumann , general_manager of the Hyatt Regency Crystal City , 10 miles from Washington ' s RFK Stadium . * Broken promises . The WCOC has stated , admirably , that among its goals were educational_programs for children and outreach to minority communities . Nickerson Gardens was to have been an example of minority outreach . Rothenberg and other World Cup dignitaries were present and available for the photo opportunity when the WCOC and Rebuild L.A. announced a major plan to install a soccer field and lights at the Watts housing project . Work would begin immediately , Rothenberg said . Was anyone at the WCOC embarrassed when , a year and a half later , the same World Cup group arranged a different photo opportunity at Nickerson Gardens , all_the while standing next to the muddy and pockmarked field that had never been upgraded ? Community organizers have complained about lack of outreach from the World Cup , which is perceived to have a natural constituency in many ethic communities . One local leader on an L.A. radio program recently asked World Cup ' s managing director , Elizabeth Primrose-Smith , why the WCOC has failed to work with some community groups . Primrose-Smith responded that the WCOC was a nonprofit organization and , as such , employed a limited staff . They would like to get_to every worthy group , she said , but there would have to be priorities . True , but if World Cup was strapped and had no money for community work , why was there $ 5 million available to &quot; lend &quot; to a for-profit company for the formation of the proposed professional soccer league ? Where ' s the priority there ?</TEXT>
