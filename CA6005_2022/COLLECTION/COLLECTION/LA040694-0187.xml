   <HEADLINE> TEAMSTERS STRIKE 22 TRUCKING COMPANIES ; LABOR : WALKOUT INVOLVING NEARLY 80 # 000 WORKERS COULD AFFECT FREIGHT SHIPMENTS NATIONWIDE . PICKET_LINES GO UP IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move that could disrupt freight shipments nationwide , the Teamsters launched a strike Tuesday night against 22 major trucking_companies after both sides failed to agree on a labor_contract covering nearly 80 # 000 workers . The strike , while not expected to paralyze transportation , could be widely felt across the country by consumers , retailers and factories . The companies hit by the walkout , which began at 9 p.m. PDT , handle about half of the nation ' s mid-size shipments over long distances . Between 7 # 000 and 10 # 000 Teamsters in the Los Angeles area are expected to be involved in the strike , said Gregory Roth , secretary-treasurer of Teamster Local 208 in El Monte , whose members began walking picket_lines outside several company truck terminals Tuesday night . &quot; No one wants to walk_out , &quot; Roth said . &quot; But the employers have taken a take-it-or-leave-it attitude on some extremely serious issues. &quot; The Teamsters late Tuesday called_off the strike against Carolina Freight Carriers Corp . after the Cherryville , N.C.-based firm broke ranks with the other trucking_companies and negotiated a separate agreement with the union . Industry observers said that a shutdown of the remaining 22 firms in the strike would leave many companies scrambling for space on other carriers . But the potential significance of the strike was downplayed Tuesday by Robert A . Young III , chairman of Trucking Management , which represents the trucking firms in_labor negotiations with the Teamsters . &quot; There are plenty of carriers out there that aren ' t union carriers &quot; that will pick_up business , Young said . He added that trucking_companies have sped_up the delivery of customer shipments to beat the strike deadline and avoid delays . Also , he said , the Trucking Management companies control only about 18 % of the nation ' s total freight traffic moved by truck , train and plane . Trucking_industry officials said cross-country shipments could be most vulnerable to disruption since the affected companies dominate long-distance transport . &quot; If your shipment is going from Orange County to the San Fernando Valley , ( the strike ) will not have much effect , &quot; said Joseph M . Nievez , vice_president of non-union Qwikway Trucking in Los Angeles . &quot; If you are going from here to Charlotte , you will have a problem. &quot; But Teamster President Ron Carey on Tuesday said the strike could spread beyond the initial 22 firms to other trucking_companies that employ an additional 40 # 000 Teamsters under the same contract . Arthur H . Bunte Jr. , chief negotiator for the companies , called the strike decision &quot; an act of irresponsible leadership that will destroy jobs , not protect them. &quot; He added that union leaders showed &quot; they would rather risk the livelihoods of their members than negotiate a settlement that would have provided increased wages . . . and the job security that can only come from working for competitive companies. &quot; Talks between the Teamsters and trucking firms broke_off last week after the companies submitted what they described as their final offer . The Teamsters rejected the offer , which included proposals to hire more part-time workers and shift more business to railroads , as one that would lead to lower starting wages and lost jobs . Union_members had already voted to authorize Teamster leaders to launch a strike if the talks failed . The companies described the measures as necessary to compete successfully against fast-growing non-union carriers . &quot; We will do whatever it takes_to finish this , &quot; said Carey , who pointed_out that the Teamster strike fund has been boosted to about $ 80 million to handle a lengthy walkout . &quot; We have no other choice but to strike. &quot; Carey said Tuesday that the strike could be avoided only if the trucking firms addressed the union ' s concerns regarding company proposals , primarily the one that would increase the use of part-time workers . But no compromise was reached .</TEXT>
