   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 ; THINGS TO COME ; BRAZIL ' S RONALDO MIGHT NOT BE PELE , BUT HE ( AND OTHERS ) PROVIDE A LOOK_AT THE FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pele wrote soccer history with his feet and it all started when he made his glittery World Cup debut in 1958 at age 17 in Sweden , guiding Brazil to the championship . Thirty-six years later , another 17-year-old unknown forward has found himself on a team of Brazilian all-stars . He too is known by one name -- Ronaldo . The temptation to even mention Pele and Ronaldo in the same sentence has proved irresistible . A soccer sin , apparently . &quot; There is one Jesus_Christ . There is one Martin_Luther_King . And there is only one Pele , &quot; says Alfredo Souza Gama , a radio broadcaster from Recife , who has followed Brazilian soccer for more_than 20 years . Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira is nearly as emphatic , saying : &quot; There will be not another Pele . The only thing similar they share is that they were 17 years old in the World Cup . He has his own style. &quot; Which is true . Ronaldo , who has few problems shaking a defender , has yet to shed his braces . He smiles often and his braces shine in the sun , but Ronaldo turns a bright shade of red when he is asked when they will be removed . &quot; By the end of the year , &quot; he says , still blushing . Do they hurt ? Ronaldo recovers his poise and laughs , saying : &quot; Only when I get hit in the mouth with a ball. &quot; The sight of Ronaldo conducting interviews and sharing the practice field with the legendary likes of Romario and Bebeto would have been unthinkable a year ago . Then , Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima was playing for an obscure second-division team , Sao Cristovao . His personal Colonel Parker was Jairzinho , a star player on the last Brazilian team to win the World Cup in 1970 . Jairzinho spotted future greatness in the youngster from an impoverished background , plucked him out of the minor_leagues and got him a deal with Cruzeiro in Belo Horizonte . Ronaldo proved to be a deadly goal-scoring machine , scoring 55 goals in his first 57 games . He is an ambidextrous threat , equally accurate with either foot . Already , Ronaldo is being utilized by the Brazilian government as an example to his peers . He was recently selected to serve as a spokesman to help get_out the vote for this fall ' s presidential elections . Voting is optional for 16 and 17 year olds . Ronaldo will turn 18 on September 22 . Here , in the days before Brazil ' s World Cup opener against Russia , Ronaldo ' s teammates are supportive and try not to offer intrusive advice . &quot; This is very unusual and different -- you have to take_into_account his age , &quot; midfielder Rai said . Said Bebeto : &quot; He is here because he has gained the right to be here. &quot; As you might guess , Ronaldo is not expected to play much during the World Cup . At least not as long as Bebeto and Romario remain uninjured . It would seem he will be somewhat of an understudy , waiting and watching and learning from his elders . Naturally , Parreira revealed nothing about his plans for Ronaldo . &quot; You never know . We have five strikers and he is one of them . Any one of them could play , &quot; Parreira said . Said Ronaldo : &quot; I worked to be here . I am looking_for an opportunity to show myself , what I can do. &quot; For Ronaldo , the constant comparisons to Pele don ' t unnerve him in the least . He seems to understand why fans as well as journalists continue to search for the next Pele , even though the quest may be futile and unrealistic . &quot; I feel very proud about it , calm and tranquil about what people are saying about me . It doesn ' t bother me , &quot; Ronaldo said . * Almost a half-generation ahead of Ronaldo is 25-year-old striker Dennis Bergkamp of the_Netherlands . Similar to the Jairzhino-Ronaldo connection , Bergkamp was &quot; discovered &quot; at age 12 and coached in the exclusive youth club Ajax by former Dutch great Johan Cruyff . Born and raised in Amsterdam , Bergkamp was named by his father after Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law . Bergkamp will be forced to shoulder more of the scoring load since the Dutch team will be without Marco Van Basten and Ruud Gullit , who walked_out_of training camp . Bergkamp , who came_into international prominence with his performance at the 1992 European Championship , left his native country and played for Inter Milan in Italy this season . By all accounts , it was anything but easy as Bergkamp received an undue amount of criticism . Still , Bergkamp received partial redemption when he picked_up his scoring late in the season when the stakes were higher . Bergkamp had decided to leave for Italy only when his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk decided to play in Milan . Bergkamp , a cool finisher , has been among the elite the last couple of seasons , finishing behind only Roberto Baggio of Italy last year and Van Basten in 1992 in World Soccer ' s voting for player of the year . In Spain , 5-10 midfielder Julen Guerrero of first-division Athletic Bilbao is part of what was considered a risky youth_movement on the part of outspoken coach Javier Clemente . Guerrero , 20 , is the second-youngest player to represent Spain , behind the legendary Zubieta , who made his national team debut as a 17-year-old in 1936 . Guerrero was voted the most promising prospect in the Spanish league in the 1992-93 season by Don Balon , the premier soccer publication in Spain . The newspaper , El Pais , took a poll of club coaches and named Guerrero the best native player this season . And , of course , one true indicator of how highly a player is regarded rests in comparison to others . Most often , Guerrero is called the Basque Laudrup . Laudrup is Michael Laudrup , the star player from Denmark . Guerrero showed a hint of his vast potential a year ago when he scored two goals in a four-minute span against Latvia in a Cup qualifying match . Guerrero , who has scored 28 league goals in two seasons , has other interests in addition to soccer . He takes piano classes and is a first-year journalism student . &quot; I ' d say my best quality is that I ' m good at sniffing_out goals , if not for myself , then for others , &quot; Guerrero said in a recent interview . The United States has Cobi Jones and his dreadlocks . Colombia has Valderrama , who looks_like Cousin It from the Addams Family rests_on top of his head . Interesting hair is not limited to players from North_America and South_America , however . Sweden ' s Henrik Larsson , a 22-year-old striker , sports dreadlocks . Larsson , who plays for Feyenoord in Holland , had an impressive six-month stretch , which earned him a spot on the World Cup team . Since he has limited international experience , Larsson is not expected to start . Should Sweden have problems scoring , however , expect Larsson to come_off the bench as a late substitute . Larsson is swift and possesses good control with a sharpness in the box . Already , he has scored a highly significant goal for Sweden . It was_on Oct . 13 against Finland and Larsson ' s header broke a 1-1 tie and put the Swedes ahead for good . Sweden won , 3-2 , and Israel ' s upset over France put the Swedes into the World Cup for the second consecutive time . Nikos Machlas , the youngest member of the Greek national team , turned 21 the day before the World Cup opened , and already he is something of a veteran . &quot; He ' s mature , &quot; said Gregory Zikos , liaison for the Greek team . &quot; Nikos is not spoiled . He ' s not a typical 21-year-old who thinks he has the world at his feet. &quot; Possessing an impressive pedigree , the striker followed in his father George ' s path and joined OFI Crete at age 17 and has played almost 100 matches in Greece ' s first division . He scored in his national team debut and his second goal was the winning goal in Greece ' s 1-0 victory over Russia , which secured first place in Group 5 World Cup qualifying . The ensuing celebration -- massive fireworks -- turned the stadium into a smoke chamber and the game was temporarily suspended because no one could see anything on the field . In the World Cup , Machlas is expected to be seen .</TEXT>
