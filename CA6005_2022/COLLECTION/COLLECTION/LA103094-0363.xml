   <HEADLINE> IN SUBURBAN MOSCOW BY-ELECTION , BALLOT OFFERS CAUTIONARY PREVIEW OF 1996 PRESIDENTIAL RACE ; RUSSIA : A RABID NATIONALIST IS AMONG THOSE VYING FOR PARLIAMENTARY SEAT . CAMPAIGN RAISES FEARS FOR DEMOCRACY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A gangland-style shooting bumped_off the last Parliament deputy from this suburban Moscow wasteland , so residents will vote for a new one today . And the main candidates are : * An ultranationalist whose swastika-bearing supporters flash straight-armed salutes . * A financier facing tax-evasion charges for his now-collapsed pyramid company , MMM . * Another millionaire , this one considered a democrat , who claimed that mass hypnosis influenced the last elections . * Not to mention a Russian karate expert . Welcome to the wild world of politics , new Russian style . This ballot circus could be watched as good fun if it was not considered a precursor to a bigger show -- the 1996 presidential elections , when many fear that fledgling democracy will give_way to Russians ' love for &quot; a tough hand. &quot; That in Mytishchi these days is called &quot; Russian order &quot; -- what Alexander Fyodorov , candidate of the black-shirted Russian National Unity movement , promises . &quot; Only we Russian nationalists can organize bringing the economy out of crisis and the revival of Great Russia , &quot; he said in an interview . &quot; We have the will . Our coming_to power is inevitable. &quot; Maybe not this time . Fyodorov has not led any polls and claims to see the Mytishchi elections mainly as a testing ground for campaign tactics to be used in Parliament in late 1995 and in the 1996 presidential run . But the jackbooted young_men who have stacked meetings held with Mytishchi voters in recent weeks have already shown that , even if they lack the support to win , their catcalls , threats and ability to turn_out scores of &quot; brothers in arms &quot; allow them to set the agenda . The election has become &quot; not about getting better lighting in Mytishchi but about ' What ' s your nationality ? ' &quot; said Sarah Mendelson , observing the race as a representative of the National Democratic Institute , a sort of foreign arm of the U.S. Democratic Party . &quot; It ' s become about national identity. &quot; Millionaire Konstantin Borovoi -- a democrat who is registered as an ethnic Russian and Russian Orthodox but has the Jewish-sounding patronymic Natanovich -- walked_out_of a meeting where ultranationalists shouted at him to &quot; Go_home to Israel ! &quot; Nationalists have also strung_up banners saying &quot; Zionism will not pass. &quot; Aside from walking_out_of meetings , none of the candidates has responded to these provocations with vigor , though Borovoi did print a leaflet with an &quot; X &quot; through a swastika . Even without the extremism of the Fyodorov camp , the Mytishchi race appears to indicate a further rise in the Russian nationalism that helped Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky trounce other parties in last December ' s parliamentary elections . In Mytishchi , candidates spouting the nationalist line range from an athlete who advocates universal training in the &quot; Russian style &quot; form of martial_arts to a doctor who complains that &quot; Russia is becoming the vassal of other states. &quot; But that does not mean rabid nationalism will become the dominant note in Russian politics , sociologist Nugzar Betaneli said . His recent polls of 6 # 000 Russians found that only 3 % of the population believed that ultranationalist leaders would serve their economic and political interests . &quot; The population has common_sense , and you can depend_on it , &quot; he said . &quot; The people don ' t ignore their interests. &quot; If that is so , their popular pragmatism may lead them to vote for Sergei Mavrodi , the business whiz behind Russia ' s biggest investment fund , MMM , whose shares collapsed last summer . He now faces tax-evasion charges . Mavrodi -- who , if he wins , would enjoy parliamentary immunity from arrest -- tells voters that he will be able to restore the value of MMM shares only if he is elected and allowed to work in peace . With an estimated 36 # 000 MMM shareholders in the Mytishchi district of about 500 # 000 people , and the rest of the vote likely to be split among 11 other candidates , Mavrodi could win by appealing_to the most concrete of voter interests . In a surprise choice of bedfellows , Mavrodi has joined forces with Zhirinovsky ' s band , the misnamed Liberal Democratic Party of Russia . Zhirinovsky paints Mavrodi as a victim of President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s government , just as he sees himself , but he does little to hide his lust for Mavrodi ' s money and has helped openly with his campaign . Mavrodi has promised to invest $ 100 million in Mytishchi , including $ 10 million before Jan . 1 -- and the region of ailing defense factories could certainly use it . Even now , after the first winter flurries , some apartments have no heat , and home phones are few . &quot; No one is interested in politics anymore , &quot; Mavrodi said on local television . &quot; Voters now are mainly interested in what a candidate can concretely give them. &quot; That apathy , fatigue and disillusionment are perhaps the most salient features of the Russian electorate today . Betaneli ' s polls found that only 7 % of Russians believe the party they voted for in December has lived_up_to their expectations . And only 12 % trust any Russian politician ; 53 % trust none of them . It is this general cynicism and apathy that make the Mytishchi election difficult to call -- and even harder to project to 1995 or 1996 . Asking Mytishchi residents last week whom they would vote for elicited responses like the large sigh heaved by dog trainer Yelena Zatyagina , 31 . &quot; I won ' t vote for anyone , &quot; Zatyagina said . &quot; I trust none of them . For a month we ' ve had no heat and no hot water . Who can I believe_in ? &quot; &quot; Horseradish is no sweeter than a turnip , &quot; said pensioner Nikolai Kravchenko , using a Russian equivalent of &quot; Six of one , half_a_dozen of the other. &quot; Polls show the Russian public split into a scattering of small camps , with about 10 % supporting Western-style democrats , 10 % pro-Communist , 10 % pro-Yeltsin and 10 % supporting other groups , including ultranationalists ; the rest are undecided . Popularity ratings show no political figure breaking the 15 % mark . In Mytishchi , a dark_horse could end_up winning just by garnering 9 % , as did the deceased deputy , Andrei Ayzderdzis . That could be someone like Alexander Zharov , the unapologetic mayor of the district ' s town of Solnechnogorsk . Certain not to win is a would-be deputy from Yeltsin ' s camp . His folks never got their act together enough to field a candidate and ended_up supporting Borovoi . &quot; Of course it hurts me to see television reports of those fascist thugs openly campaigning in the streets of Moscow , &quot; said Lev Ponomaryov , co-chairman of the pro-Yeltsin Federal_Party of Democratic Russia . &quot; This is their first real chance to have their man in Parliament . . . . Unfortunately , we have been very busy with our organizational problems recently and didn ' t have time to prepare properly for this by-election. &quot; The pro-Yeltsin camp has largely been busy dividing itself into new fragments , guaranteeing its own confused impotence in the political_arena . The one ray_of_light for Russian reformists is that , with the advent of men like Fyodorov to oppose Zhirinovsky , the ultranationalist camp appears also to be splintering . Fyodorov and Russian National Unity have no use for Zhirinovsky ; they say he stole their ideas and ran with them . Meanwhile , they are learning : At the most recent voter meetings , Fyodorov ' s men have begun appearing in suits instead of uniforms , and without their swastikas . &quot; We realized that it turns people off , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
