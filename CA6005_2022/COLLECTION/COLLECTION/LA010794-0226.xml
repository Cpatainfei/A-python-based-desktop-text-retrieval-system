   <HEADLINE> NEW SERVICE TO ALLOW CONSUMERS OPEN ACCESS TO NETWORKS ; AT &amp; T ENTERS THE ON-LINE RACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co . on Thursday announced it is starting an on-line service that , for the first time , will give consumers access to electronic_databases and other communications networks from any location and without a great_deal of computer know-how . The service , to be offered beginning this summer , will give AT &amp; T entrance into the rapidly growing , $ 800-million market for on-line services now dominated by Prodigy , Compuserve and America Online . More importantly for AT &amp; T , its new PersonaLink Services will help drive demand for database services , long-distance_calls and portable communications devices -- all areas in which the big phone_company is heavily involved . &quot; The key is to have a database in your briefcase , &quot; said Rick Martin , research_director at Chicago Corp . &quot; You will have instantaneous access to data , no matter where you are and no matter what device you are using. &quot; AT &amp; T will have tough competition in the on-line field , however , since other major companies such_as Apple Computer and Microsoft also plan to enter the business . It also faces technical challenges , as most wireless devices still lack the power to be effective terminals for tapping into on-line systems , analysts said . Also , AT &amp; T ' s long-term success offering such services depends_on its being guaranteed free access to the various communications lines , including cable , that have been strung into American homes . &quot; This is just the beginning -- it ' s going_to evolve over five years , &quot; Martin said . Questions of access to communications lines may be one reason AT &amp; T joined consumer groups Thursday in the fight to pressure the Clinton_Administration to assure open access to all companies as it considers new regulations to spur development of a communications infrastructure . Robert Kavner , AT &amp; T ' s chief of multimedia products and services , lashed_out Thursday at what he called the cable industry ' s &quot; closed-access , non-competitive model &quot; for the Information Age during his keynote_address at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . &quot; We believe today ' s cable industry gate-keeping model would stifle commercial and creative potential if it were re-created in the new , interactive_multimedia world , &quot; Kavner said . &quot; The potential of interactive networks is not found in 500 pre-programmed channels . The beauty is that consumers have the freedom to choose any subject or service from the intelligent terminal in their homes. &quot; While content suppliers such_as television producers must negotiate with a cable operator to get their programs aired , Kavner said , AT &amp; T favors a model in which everyone has equal access to a broad communications network . Kavner ' s speech , which appeared to mark a new level of aggressiveness for AT &amp; T , comes a_few days before Vice_President Al Gore is scheduled to speak at a UCLA symposium on ensuring openness and accessibility to communications networks . AT &amp; T cited PersonaLink , unveiled at the show , as an example of the kind of open services it espouses . AT &amp; T ' s key advantage over other on-line systems will be the system ' s ability to be accessed by portable communications devices being offered by a growing number of electronics_companies . AT &amp; T said its first customers will be mobile professionals trying to keep_in touch with their secretaries through electronic_mail from portable communications devices . The service makes_it easier for customers to access computer_networks by using a new software language developed by General Magic , a Mountain View , Calif. , computer company jointly owned by such major electronics_companies as AT &amp; T , Apple and Motorola . The software , which was released Thursday , allows AT &amp; T to create &quot; agents , &quot; or special packets of code , that enter a network and can search out and sift through vast amounts of information . The agents can also take_on relatively complex tasks . A busy executive could have a system_programmed so that when his or her mother ' s birthday came_along the agent could wake_up , send a message of love and a bouquet of flowers , said Dan Rosen , an AT &amp; T vice_president . Analysts said AT &amp; T ' s move could help establish a standard for wireless communications devices around the General Magic software Telescript . Motorola and Sony , partners in the General Magic alliance , have said they will introduce personal communications devices that use Telescript technology this year . America Online and several wireless companies have also committed themselves to Telescript .</TEXT>
