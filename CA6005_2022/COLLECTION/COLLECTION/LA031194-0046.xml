   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER SAYS JAPAN BROKE TRADE PLEDGE ; POLICY : SPEAKING HARSHLY AFTER FRUITLESS TALKS , THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS THAT ' GREAT NATIONS KEEP THEIR COMMITMENTS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After making no progress toward resolving America ' s economic conflict with Japan , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher on Thursday accused Japanese officials of breaking their promises by failing to negotiate a new trade agreement with the United States . &quot; I said simply that great nations keep their commitments , &quot; Christopher said following meetings with Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata . In July , during a visit by President Clinton to Tokyo , Japan promised to bring_about a &quot; highly significant decrease &quot; in its $ 120-billion-a-year trade surplus with the rest of the world . &quot; No one would agree with the contention that Japan has met its commitments , &quot; the secretary_of_state said . Christopher ' s harsh words appeared to represent an effort to place Japan on the defensive in the continuing conflict over the two countries ' trading relationship . They also reflect the Clinton_Administration ' s desire to shift public_debate away from the details of the trade dispute and toward the question of whether Japan has violated its promises . On Wednesday , Motorola Inc. said it was making progress on a deal to improve its access to Japan ' s cellular_telephone market . But that dispute , which prompted the Administration to threaten sanctions , is just one issue in the trade conflict . In a speech prepared_for delivery today to the Japan Assn . of Corporate_Executives , Christopher planned to press hard at the theme that America ' s huge trade imbalance with Japan cannot be allowed to last . &quot; For the world ' s two largest economies , agreeing to disagree is not good_enough , &quot; his speech reads . &quot; I came_to Japan to make_sure our message is understood : Your government needs to take firm action to honor the commitments it made. &quot; Both Japanese and American officials indicated Thursday that it is becoming increasingly unlikely that the economic frictions will ease any time soon . Hosokawa and Hata told Christopher that Japan plans to come_up with a market-opening package &quot; with substantial meaning &quot; by the end of March . But they said nothing to him about a Japanese Cabinet decision Wednesday to delay announcement of portions of the new package until shortly before the G-7 summit_meeting of the world ' s leading industrialized nations July 8-10 in Naples . The Cabinet decision marks Japan ' s second step backward , in terms of delay , since trade talks between the two countries broke_down at the Feb . 11 summit between Clinton and Hosokawa . * There have been &quot; some beginning hints of change in Japan ' s position , &quot; said a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on the condition he not be named . But he said these have been &quot; vague and generalized . . . and even those steps have been criticized within the government and in business. &quot; America ' s trade_deficit with Japan was approximately $ 60 billion last year and is expected to grow . Nevertheless , Hosokawa , in a 45-minute meeting , urged the Clinton_Administration to be patient . The prime_minister told Christopher that &quot; Japan is changing . Many foreigners may see the change as occurring slowly . But we are working steadily to carry_out fundamental changes in our system . These will be very important changes for the Japanese people. &quot; Perhaps surprisingly , there has been no sign yet that the persistent economic frictions are harming security ties between the United States and Japan . Senior U.S. defense officials joined Christopher here for meetings with top officials of the Japanese Defense Agency for talks on defense issues . Christopher , who stopped in Japan for a two-day visit on his way to China , was never expected to bring the sort of detailed proposals that would settle the trade dispute . His task seems to be to tell Japan that the security-minded parts of the Administration , such_as the State and Defense_departments , support Clinton ' s hawkish policy on trade .</TEXT>
