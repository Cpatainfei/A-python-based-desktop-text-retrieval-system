   <HEADLINE> AIRPORTS AIM FOR PROFITS WITH BETTER FOOD , SHOPS ; RETAIL : POOR MEALS AND OVERPRICED SOUVENIRS GRADUALLY ARE GOING THE WAY OF TERMINALS RUN BY A SINGLE CONCESSIONAIRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With more_than 800 flights to and from Sacramento under his belt , Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) has encountered more_than his share of second-rate airport food . &quot; You were sure the Sacramento airport was open 24 hours a day because whatever it was that they were serving you looked_like it was 24 hours old , &quot; he said . &quot; You slid your tray down the line , they ' d give you something , and you ' d wonder what it was . My advice for ( travelers at ) most airports is : Don ' t eat. &quot; The politician ' s ruminations will ring true for frequent fliers who have braved an airport cafeteria line or paid too_much for a paperback novel at an airport newsstand . But poor food and overpriced souvenir stands gradually are giving_way to attractively decorated restaurant and retail operations that use competitive pricing and solid service to win sales . Changes are being driven by the growing realization that travelers generally have both time and money on their hands , a combination that ' s &quot; the magic formula for retailing , &quot; according to Monica Nassif , a spokeswoman for Miami-based Sun Glass Hut , which operates 11 stores at airports . Airport executives and retailers say that truly competitive pricing is the key to success . &quot; The other day at an airport I paid $ 2.75 for a Whopper that I ' d only pay 99 cents for at a Burger King restaurant , &quot; said Mike Epstein , marketing vice_president for San Diego-based Creative Croissants , which operates a coffee stand at John Wayne Airport . &quot; that ' s why airports are starting to go_to street pricing . Customers won ' t stand_for ( high prices ) anymore. &quot; * Creative Croissants ' John Wayne location , owned by franchisees Lori and Robert Park of Orange , charges slightly higher than off-airport prices for some of its menu items . But their shop hasn ' t raised its prices in four years -- not even on a 12-ounce cup of coffee , which still sells for $ 1 . &quot; People are pleased with our prices , &quot; Lori Park said . &quot; They tell us we are lower priced than most other airports . I think that ' s good for our business , because we have lots of regular customers. &quot; Pittsburgh ' s innovative &quot; air mall &quot; is the acknowledged industry leader . The 2-year-old terminal is home to more_than 80 restaurants and retail shops , including TGI Fridays , Nature Company , the Body Shop , Upper_Deck Authenticated and Sun Glass Hut . Pittsburgh officials offer a simple measure of the mall ' s success : Sales per boarded passenger have soared to nearly $ 7 , up from just $ 2.40 per visit before the new airport terminal opened . Another gauge of its popularity is that up_to 5 % of monthly sales at the air mall go_to local residents who view the airport as an alternative shopping_center . &quot; On our second anniversary we had television crews in here interviewing shoppers who were here to shop , not catch planes , &quot; said Guy Wescott , an executive with BAA Pittsburgh Inc. , the mall ' s operator . Pittsburgh ' s successful experiment with &quot; street pricing &quot; has prompted the Dallas-Fort Worth airport and other big-city airfields to adopt rules that require retailers and restaurants to charge prices equivalent_to those at off-airport sites . But Los Angeles International Airport is instead banking on competition rather than mandated pricing to keep prices low when its new culinary lineup is completed in 1995 . One restaurateur who asked not to be identified suggested that LAX is doing a disservice to passengers by not capping prices . &quot; People are not stupid , &quot; said the restaurateur , who is bidding on space at LAX . &quot; They know what a cup of coffee costs. &quot; Still , competition for Los Angeles airport ' s retail slots has been fierce . Hundreds of restaurant operators and food_companies , including Wolfgang Puck , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Creative Croissants , Panda Express and Haagen-Dazs , responded last spring when the airport announced that it would revitalize its restaurants through competitive bidding . Airport operators expect the revamped restaurant operation to dramatically increase the amount of revenue that flows to LAX . At present , food and beverage operations generate about $ 50 million in gross_revenue , and operators pass_through about $ 6 million in payments to the airport . LAX wants to create a blend of national brand names and local favorites that will provide &quot; a real reflection of Los Angeles , &quot; said airport contracts manager Ramon Olivares . The airport , which earlier revamped its retail operations , will start to unveil its new list of restaurant and kiosk operators early next year , and travelers should notice a dramatic change by year ' s end . Similarly , the Dallas-Fort Worth airport is sorting through a short_list of 150 companies that want to operate restaurants and shops_at the Texas airport . In a hint of what ' s to come , one concessionaire has opened a retail court featuring the best of Sharper Image , Christian Dior and Timberland . * Some older airports won ' t easily lend themselves to increased retail operations . Pittsburgh ' s new terminal owes much of its success to its design -- passengers are funneled through its centrally located mall , an option that ' s typically not available to older airports . And airports must tackle the thorny question of leasing costs before opting for street pricing . If lease rates are too high , product prices often follow . &quot; Airport rentals are coming_down , but they ' re still three times what the normal mall retailer pays , &quot; said Gregg Paradies , vice_president and co-owner of Atlanta-based the Paradies Shops , which operates the Dallas retail court as well as shops_at John Wayne Airport and at Burbank airport . But when it ' s possible to make the change , the mall-like approach can be a godsend for cash-strapped airport operators who collect fees from restaurants and retailers . &quot; This is all new dollars being spent , &quot; said Lowry Davison , director of commercial development at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport . &quot; People have the money and they ' re willing to spend it , given the chance. &quot; What is attracting retailers and restaurants to airports is that travelers generally have more money to spend . Host Marriott in Bethesda , Md. , which operates in nearly 80 airports , reports that the average traveler spends about an hour in airports before and after flights . That average traveler ' s $ 65 # 000 annual income translates into more wealth than the average mall-goer . &quot; It ' s a captive audience in the true sense of the word , &quot; said Bruce Schroder , a vice_president at Irvine-based Taco Bell , which operates restaurants and snack_bars in about 40 airports . &quot; And travelers tend to be higher-income people for whom price is not as much of an issue. &quot; While McDonald ' s , Taco Bell and Burger King are increasingly common at airports , operators now are seasoning the restaurant mix with lesser-known , regional favorites . Boston ' s Logan Airport features Legal Seafoods , and Host Marriott has invited Wild Goose Ale House , a popular brew pub in the Northwest , to operate restaurants on the East Coast . Creative Croissants ' Epstein believes that bigger restaurant names will lose ground to smaller , more specialized companies that can offer &quot; healthy foods at friendly prices. &quot; Creative Croissants now is focusing its expansion plans on airports ; by the end of next year the company could have as_many as 15 storefronts at airports across the country . The latest wave in restaurant and retail development has debunked the &quot; old theory that ( travelers ) will buy whatever it was you decided to put_on the shelves , &quot; Paradies said . Travelers will always buy toothbrushes , newspapers , cigarettes and souvenirs , Paradies said . But , given the chance , they ' ll also buy much more . Sharper Image ' s airport shop_at DFW in Dallas has sold a handful of massage chairs -- hefty pieces_of_furniture that retail for $ 2 # 895 . Charley Shin , a Columbus , Ohio , businessman who ' s eaten his fair share of really bad airport food , also views airports ' retail areas as potentially lucrative opportunities . Any initial doubts that Shin had about opening a Charley ' s Steakery in Pittsburgh ' s air mall disappeared after the restaurant blossomed into one of his 30-unit chain ' s top performers . Shin reports another plus : Airport locations are giving his chain &quot; the high visibility and instant credibility &quot; needed to expand into highly competitive markets , such_as Southern California , where he operates just one restaurant , at Westminster Mall . The new approach of multiple , brand-name retailers and local favorites is a far_cry from the days when airport operators awarded contracts to a single large concessionaire . &quot; In the old days it wasn ' t a bad idea to have one commissary take_care of the whole airport , &quot; said Tarun Kapoor , a Cal Poly Pomona professor who studies the hospitality industry . &quot; Having a single operator made_it possible to make_sure there ' s a bar in every part of the terminal , but it ignores what the public really wants now. &quot; &quot; Slowly , &quot; Kapoor said , &quot; the institutional mind set of airport food service is giving_way to something that ' s much more sophisticated. &quot; American airports are now taking a page from their European counterparts , particularly English airfields &quot; which are something of a department_store , &quot; Lowry said . &quot; They ' re so successful ( in England ) that the local populace actually goes_to the airport to shop. &quot; Airport operators in the United States don ' t expect to steal great numbers of shoppers from malls because airports typically aren ' t located in heavily populated neighborhoods and usually charge high fees for parking . A good chunk of spending at airports goes_for impulse purchases , a fact that ' s not lost on operators of high-priced sports memorabilia . The National Football_League and the Professional_Golf Assn . are opening sports-oriented airport shops that will cater to affluent male business_travelers . Carlsbad-based Upper_Deck Authenticated , the sports souvenir retailer , is counting_on spontaneous purchases at a shop it opened a year ago in Pittsburgh . &quot; It seems like the perfect place to be , &quot; said spokesman Camron Bussard . &quot; Airports haven ' t been a venue for us in the past , but when you look_at the amount of traffic it ' s a good opportunity , and we ' re looking_at other locations. &quot; Despite the flurry of activity nationwide , croissants , Starbucks coffee and designer yogurt are the exception rather than the rule , particularly at smaller airports . &quot; The cafeteria line is still the most common approach , &quot; Kapoor said . &quot; And then you ' ve got the places . . . where they have the traditional hot dog and potato_chips . . . what I call the cholesterol diet. &quot; Ascending Retail Revenue John Wayne Airport receives lease payments and a percentage of gross sales from its airport food and beverage service operators .
