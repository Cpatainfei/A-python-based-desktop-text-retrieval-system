   <HEADLINE> FIXED HUBBLE ' S SHARP PHOTOS CAUSE ELATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ebullient astronomers released the first sharp , focused images from the refurbished Hubble Space Telescope on Thursday as evidence that the astronauts who carried_out five days of dramatic spacewalks to repair the telescope last month had accomplished their goal . The unprecedented detail in NASA photos of a spiral_galaxy , a dense nursery of young stars and other distant celestial objects was proof that after three years of national ridicule and a costly repair mission , the orbital observatory is performing up_to expectations . &quot; The trouble with Hubble is over , &quot; said Sen . Barbara A . Mikulski , the Maryland Democrat who heads the Senate subcommittee responsible_for financing the space agency . Holding a photograph of the spiral_galaxy over her head like a trophy , she said : &quot; We will be able to do 21st Century science. &quot; NASA Administrator Daniel S . Goldin said the telescope ' s performance exceeded the agency ' s &quot; wildest dreams. &quot; Presidential science adviser John Gibbons , calling the repairs &quot; a superb example of the new NASA , &quot; made_it clear that what the White_House liked best about the rejuvenated telescope was that it had been fixed on_time and within budget . Launched three years ago , the Hubble Space Telescope was designed to see farther into the universe than any telescope ever built , using wavelengths blocked to astronomers on Earth . After it reached orbit , engineers determined that its primary mirror had been ground to the wrong prescription , a flaw that the manufacturer apparently had concealed from the space agency , according to congressional testimony . During an 11-day shuttle mission last month , a crew of seven astronauts installed a set of corrective optics designed to compensate for the Hubble ' s flawed mirror and also replaced the telescope ' s workhorse wide-field camera with a more sophisticated set of four cameras built by the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . NASA flight controllers have not deployed all_of the telescope ' s new instruments , but they said the new camera and corrective optics have been tested extensively since the repair mission and they are certain that the telescope is performing properly . &quot; For the first time , &quot; senior JPL scientist John Trauger said , &quot; we know we can begin doing the kind of science you can only do with a telescope like this above Earth ' s atmosphere. &quot; During Hubble ' s planned 15 years of operation , astronomers will scrutinize objects as close as asteroids , comets and planets within the solar_system and as distant as quasars at the farthest and oldest reaches of the universe . More_than 1 # 200 astronomers are scheduled to use the telescope this year . Astronomers say the refocused Hubble will be able to provide final proof about the existence of black_holes and , over the next three years , will allow them to calculate the true age of the universe . This spring , astronomers plan to use the Hubble to search for a black_hole at the heart of galaxy M87 . Prior to a news_conference Thursday , NASA officials treated Hubble ' s &quot; first_light &quot; pictures -- the name given to an observatory ' s initial photos -- with the kind of secrecy usually associated with the rollout of a new car in Detroit . Once the images were made public , agency officials in Washington and engineers at JPL could barely contain their elation , competing for superlatives to describe the new optics . The corrected telescope , they said , was powerful enough to pick_out a firefly 8 # 500 miles away ; to see &quot; with clarity &quot; objects 12 billion light-years from Earth . &quot; These corrected images are as perfect as engineering can achieve and the laws of physics will allow , &quot; said James H . Crocker , a Hubble scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore . The photos released Thursday were taken with the camera designed by JPL . They included : * An image of Eta Carinae , one of the most massive and luminous stars in the night sky , surrounded by an expanding ruby red shell of high-speed stellar gases . The refurbished Hubble detected the structure of the material closest to the star -- of intense interest to astronomers -- for the first time . * An image of the heart of a spiral_galaxy called M100 in the Virgo cluster , showing that the telescope can resolve relatively small objects in a galaxy tens of millions of light-years away . The resolution is high enough to enable astronomers to make the crucial measurements necessary to gauge the size of the universe . * An image of a star nursery inside a giant cloud of gas in a neighboring galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud , revealing more_than 3 # 000 stars in its central star cluster . In earlier , blurred Hubble images , astronomers could discern only several hundred .</TEXT>
