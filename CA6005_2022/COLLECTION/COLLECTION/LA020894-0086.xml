   <HEADLINE> NORDIC SKIING PREVIEW ; IT ' S HAMMER TIME FOR NORWEGIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It should come as no surprise that United States athletes do not figure to clean_up in the Nordic events during the Winter_Olympics opening Saturday . Americans have never been very successful in Nordic skiing -- cross-country and jumping -- and its spinoff , the biathlon . They have seldom threatened the dominating northern Europeans for whom the competition is named . Only twice , in fact , since the Winter Games began in 1924 , have Americans won Nordic medals . And in one case the athlete , Norwegian-born Anders Haugen , had to wait 50 years to get his bronze medal for ski_jumping . Haugen , a naturalized American , paid his way to the first Winter Games , which weren ' t recognized as Olympics until a year after they were over , at Chamonix , France , in 1924 . There , he took his two jumps , was told he had finished fourth and went_home . Then , in 1974 , an error in the scoring was uncovered , showing that Haugen had really finished third , ahead of Norway ' s legendary Thorleif Haug . And so , at 83 , Haugen went_to Oslo -- Norway is the birthplace of ski_jumping -- to receive his medal in a special ceremony . There was no protest by Haug , who by then was 40 years dead . Two years later , in the 1976 Games at Innsbruck , Austria , Bill Kochgave America its second Nordic medal , surprising the world and himself by finishing second in the men ' s 30-kilometer cross-country race . Koch , America ' s one_and_only Nordic star , had an up-and-down career and developed a reputation as an innovator . He pioneered the &quot; skating &quot; technique that eventually led to the recognition of freestyle cross-country racing , as opposed to the skis-in-two-tracks classical style , then retired in the mid-1980s . He launched a comeback two years ago and made the U.S. team that went_to Albertville , France , proclaiming that he was really aiming for the Lillehammer Games . At 36 , though , he was no threat at Albertville , and has since dropped_out of the picture again . So , once more , American skiers will likely finish back in the pack , while the cross-country giants -- the Norwegians , Swedes , Finns and Russians -- look_to the medals . Norway , particularly , is hoping for a strong showing here , for a number of reasons : Cross-country_skiing is the national sport ; the Norwegians have the home-track advantage , and they did so well two years ago at Albertville . Until then , no Norwegian man had won an Olympic cross-country race in 16 years , but Vegard Ulvang took the opener , the men ' s 30K classical , and teammate Bjorn Daehlie finished second . Norway was off and ski-running . Ulvang and Daehlie each won three gold and one silver medals in ' 92 and continue as the 1-2 international power , although Daehlie has emerged as the team ' s star . Leading the U.S. men are Norwegian-born John Aalberg of Salt_Lake_City , and three Midwesterners -- Luke Bodensteiner of West Bend , Wis. ; Todd Boonstra of Eagan , Minn. , and Ben Husaby of Eden Prairie , Minn . Nina Kemppel of Anchorage ; Kerrin Petty of Townshend , Vt. , and Laura Wilson of Montpelier , Vt. , are the best U.S. women . In ski_jumping , the balance_of_power has shifted , from Finland to Austria . Toni Nieminen , the Finnish teen-ager who won two golds and a bronze in ' 92 , was hailed as a national hero , then let success affect him and has had competitive problems the last two seasons . The new international standout is Austrian Andreas Goldberger , 22 , the 1993 World Cup champion . Ernst Vettori , the normal-hill gold-medalist at Albertville , Werner Rathmayr and Martin Hoellwarth give the Austrian team depth . The local favorite is Norwegian Espen Bredesen , who won the large-hill competition in the World Championships here last year , and led Norway to the gold medal in the team event . Jim Holland of Norwich , Vt. , and Randy Weber of Steamboat Springs , Colo. , are the United States ' best hopes . Holland finished 12th on the large hill and 13th on the normal hill in Albertville but slipped_in international competition in 1993 , then suffered a back injury in December and has been trying to regroup . In Nordic combined , which pairs jumping_off the normal hill with a 15K cross-country race , youngsters Ryan Heckman and Todd Lodwick , both of Steamboat Springs , are the U.S. stars , although each is a better jumper than a cross-country skier . Eastern Europeans have traditionally dominated in the biathlon , which combines cross-country_skiing with target shooting . But now the promising newcomers include Andreas Zingerle of Italy among the men and Myriam Bedard of Canada among the women . The best Americans are Curt Schreiner of Day , N.Y. ; R . Duncan Douglas of Lake Placid , N.Y. , and Joan Guetschow of Minnetonka , Minn .</TEXT>
