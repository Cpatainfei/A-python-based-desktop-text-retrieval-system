   <TEXT> Terri Lynn Esterak was supposed to return her three young daughters to her ex-husband at the end of the weekend . Because she did not have primary custody , she was supposed to return them Sunday night to their father , Michael Esterak . After that , her time with her daughters was to be structured by a calendar : only on alternate weekends , alternate holidays , and Christmas and Easter . It was a court_order she apparently couldn ' t accept . On Saturday , Esterak booked herself a swank hotel_room in Indian Wells . Then she murdered Erica , Eden and Erin in their pajamas and killed herself , police said , in a scene discovered Monday by a hotel maid and security personnel who broke_in through the double-locked door . Nobody knows what kind of darkness cloaked the 31-year-old woman , what she was thinking . Her attorney , Sara Wasserstrom , spoke_to her client last week as the mother was approaching the end of a court-sanctioned , monthlong vacation with her girls at her Rancho Mirage home . &quot; Terri said she didn ' t think the kids would want to go_back ( to their father ) , &quot; Wasserstrom said . &quot; And she didn ' t want them to go_back . That often happens in a divorce , at the end of summer vacation. &quot; Attorney Constance Bessada , who represented the husband in the divorce case , was at_a_loss to explain what happened . &quot; I ' ve spoken_to about everybody I can think_of who was close to this case , because we need to do our own soul-searching , &quot; Bessada said . &quot; What did we miss ? We ' ve known them as persons , not just names on a piece_of_paper . We ' ve seen their little_fingers move . Those children are being grieved by all_of us. &quot; Bessada said she could only wonder at why it happened . &quot; People get obsessed with what they must have , &quot; she reflected Tuesday . &quot; I ' ve had a client who was subsequently murdered by an abusive husband , and a client who committed suicide . But never this , when babies pay . Innocent , beautiful children who loved both their parents. &quot; Strictly as a crime , the multiple murder and suicide at the Hyatt Grand Champions Villas was not hard to solve , police said . The girls were found lying on the bed , shot to death . Next to their mother ' s body was a revolver . Suicide notes were nearby , but the contents have not been revealed . The attorneys who handled the divorce of Terri Lynn Esterak , a onetime interior_designer , and Michael Esterak , a driver for United Parcel Service , said the shootings reflect the darkest side of broken marriages : children as pawns . &quot; We need to somehow find_out why this happened so we can try to stop it from happening again , &quot; Bessada said . &quot; How is it that we can get_to the point where there ' s a custody and visitation agreement that satisfies the children ' s needs , and this still happens ? &quot; The couple were married in 1980 . Several years ago , she moved to Rancho Mirage to be closer to her parents . Because of his job , Michael Esterak stayed in the Los Angeles area -- in North Hollywood for a time , then Northridge until the earthquake dislocated him . He made the 2 1 / 2-hour drive to Rancho Mirage on weekends to visit his family . At some point last year , he learned that his wife had struck_up a relationship with a restaurant owner , Bessada said . &quot; I don ' t know if he walked or she kicked ( him out ) , &quot; Bessada said , but he filed for divorce last year and moved to Long_Beach . There was little dispute over property division : She got the Lexus , he kept his Ford Bronco , a Toyota pickup and Celica and the stocks and bonds , and each kept the furnishings they had when they separated . There would be no spousal support . But unresolved was the most difficult decision of all : custody of Erica , 9 , Eden , 4 , and Erin , 2 , who attorneys for both sides said received the doting attention and love of both mother and father . The judge listened to the advice of a family therapist and an evaluator who met with the children , reflected on the children ' s stability and awarded primary custody to Michael . It didn ' t help her case , the judge noted , that Terri Lynn Esterak went_on vacation with her boyfriend to Europe last fall and allowed her ex-husband to watch the girls . Terri Lynn Esterak complained in court papers that her ex-husband had physically abused her in front of the girls ; Michael Esterak said it was his wife who physically attacked him in front of the girls . He blamed cocaine for her behavior . In court papers , his new girlfriend said Terri Lynn Esterak was verbally abusive to her . Each ex-spouse sought restraining orders to force the other to keep a distance . Wasserstrom grew anxious when she learned Monday morning that Terri Lynn Esterak had not shown_up to deliver the girls to their father . &quot; This is heart-wrenching , &quot; Wasserstrom said . &quot; They were adorable little kids. &quot; Bessada said she had considered Terri Lynn Esterak &quot; high-strung &quot; and driven , but never was concerned about the children ' s safety . &quot; These beautiful little beings never belonged in a courthouse to begin with , but they kept having to show_up , &quot; she said . &quot; What the system needs , I don ' t know , but something ' s not working. &quot; Times staff writer Vivien Chen contributed to this story .</TEXT>
