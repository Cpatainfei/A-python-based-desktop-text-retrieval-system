   <HEADLINE> RABIN REJECTS PLO TERMS FOR NEW TALKS ; ISRAEL : ADDRESSING U.S. JEWISH LEADERS , PREMIER RULES_OUT REMOVAL OF SETTLERS FROM TERRITORIES . HE MEETS WITH CLINTON TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although he predicted final agreement soon on the first phase of Palestinian self-rule , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday ruled_out the sort of concessions that the Palestine Liberation Organization has demanded before it will resume peace talks with his government . His remarks came_in an uncompromising speech to his government ' s strongest U.S. supporters , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee . Rabin , who meets President Clinton at the White_House today , said his government is unwilling to reopen issues that were decided before the PLO suspended negotiations after an Israeli settler massacred about 30 Palestinian worshipers at the Hebron mosque . He rejected the PLO call_for removing Jewish settlements from the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , saying Palestinians and Jews are destined to live together forever both in Israel and the occupied territories . The Clinton_Administration is trying to broker a means to restart talks_over details left unsettled when Israel and the PLO signed an agreement Sept . 13 on the White_House lawn calling_for Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho . Rabin and Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher discussed the_matter for an hour or so Tuesday . To help restart the negotiations , Christopher urged Rabin to consider PLO proposals that would put Hebron under the control of a Palestinian police_force , according to the New York Times . Neither Israel nor the PLO has given any public indication that it is ready to soften its conditions for resuming talks . After the massacre in the West_Bank town of Hebron , the PLO said it would not continue talks without new measures to protect Palestinian civilians . Israel condemned the killings but said it will not risk its own security to satisfy PLO demands . Despite the seeming deadlock , Israeli and Palestinian officials both predicted that the talks will resume eventually . U.S. mediators expressed similar optimism . In his speech , Rabin asserted : &quot; We are near the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho stage in the negotiations for peace . We already see the finish line. &quot; But Rabin said Israel will not allow the Hebron massacre to erode its own security . &quot; I must clarify to our Palestinian partners : The feeling of loss and sorrow in the wake of the Hebron tragedy will not change our fundamental positions regarding the security of the state of Israel and its citizens , including the Jewish residents of Judea , Samaria and the Gaza Strip , &quot; he said . &quot; We have no intention of compromising on any security matters . &quot; As horrendous as the murder in Hebron was , there can be no departure from the course of negotiation with the Palestinians , &quot; he added . &quot; It is time to get_back to the negotiating table. &quot; In public , at least , Administration officials have said Israel has done enough to meet the Palestinians ' legitimate concerns . They have urged the PLO to restart the talks without insisting on more concessions . But the Administration is trying to negotiate a deal with Arafat in which the PLO would promise to resume the talks in exchange for a U.N. Security_Council resolution condemning the Hebron killings . The American government has blocked action on the resolution while negotiating with Arafat . Israel objects strongly to the resolution because it refers to East Jerusalem , which was under Jordanian control before the 1967 Middle_East War , as &quot; occupied territory. &quot; Although Washington has generally resisted such phrasing , officials have hinted that Washington might be willing to accept that concept if it results in an early resumption of the negotiations .</TEXT>
