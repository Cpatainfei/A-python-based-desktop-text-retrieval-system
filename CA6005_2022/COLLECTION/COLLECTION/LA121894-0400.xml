   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / COUTURE ON CAMERA : WHEN SHOW_BIZ TAKES ON FASHION BIZ , ONE SIZE FITS ALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; You ever been to a fashion show ? It ' s a sort of pagan ritual , a ceremonial_dance where the faithful sit around sipping tea and worshiping clothes . There ' s a sacrifice involved , too . $ 1 # 500 for a dress , so help me . . . . &quot; -- Gregory Peck , as a sportswriter married to a fashion_designer in the 1957 film &quot; Designing Woman. &quot; * When the lights came_up after a screening a_few weeks ago of Robert Altman ' s latest film , &quot; Ready to Wear , &quot; a journalist in the third row turned_to the fashion editor sitting next to him and said , &quot; Those clothes weren ' t real , were they ? &quot; He was referring to the tartan kilts and figure-distorting bustles that , in the film , are the provocative designs of Cort Romney ( Richard E . Grant ) . &quot; Oh , sure they are , &quot; the editor chirped . &quot; that ' s all Vivienne Westwood. &quot; The reporter couldn ' t believe his ears any more_than he believed his eyes . What looked_to him like fantasy costumes never intended to be worn were actually the clothes that those who attend the twice-yearly ready-to-wear collections in Paris , Milan and London -- &quot; the faithful , &quot; as Gregory Peck called them in &quot; Designing Woman &quot; -- stand_up and cheer about . What seemed to this guy to be visual_jokes are the styles that fuel fashion , the uncompromised visions of one of the world ' s most respected designers . This man , like Peck ' s character , must be forgiven . He is not a fashion person . He is not a member of what has been called &quot; the cult of the initiated. &quot; But that makes him a lot more typical an audience for Altman ' s new film , which opens Christmas_Day . Audiences who are not acquainted first hand with the world of high_fashion are not likely to believe their eyes , either , as actors like Lauren Bacall and Tracey Ullman rub elbows with such real-life designers as Christian Lacroix , Gianfranco Ferre and Jean-Paul Gaultier . What ' s real ( editors finding their hotel_rooms full of flowers and gifts upon check-in ) and what ' s fake are all mixed_up for this big-screen fashion farce . But that ' s usually what happens when it comes_to putting the fashion_industry on film . It is a case of one business of artifice trying to capture another business of artifice -- cosmetically concealed warts and all . Throughout the years , when Hollywood turns its cameras on the fashion_industry , the pictures that emerge are glamorous to be sure . Like the fashion show sequence filmed in_color and plugged into the black-and-white world of George Cukor ' s 1939 version of &quot; The Women , &quot; fashion injects pizazz into a film . But film isn ' t always so kind to fashion . Although the fashion_business adores the movies unconditionally -- designers repeatedly find inspiration in the glamorous days of Hollywood ' s golden_age -- it is often a one-sided love_affair . The portrait the film world paints of the fashion_business is usually not an altogether pretty one . Models are beautiful but stupid . Designers are coddled , capricious creatures . Fashion editors are flighty fascists . Everyone in the business is superficial , self-obsessed and convinced that what they ' re doing is of Earth-shattering importance . &quot; What has been shown is that they ' re basically shallow and that they have no inner lives , &quot; says designer Isaac Mizrahi , who is the subject of a new fashion documentary called &quot; Unzipped &quot; by director Douglas Keeve . &quot; Fashion is always treated like the naughty stepchild. &quot; &quot; Mahogany , &quot; for instance , the 1975 film about a would-be fashion_designer ( Diana Ross ) who becomes a top model , &quot; really said a lot of scary things about fashion , &quot; says Mizrahi . He isn ' t referring to the Kabuki-style costumes Ross designed for the film , either . In &quot; Mahogany , &quot; like so many fashion films , the fashion players are emotionally bankrupt . As Ross ' politically correct boyfriend ( Billy Dee Williams ) says , &quot; Baby , I don ' t understand this whole trip . . . making clothes for rich people to look_at in a magazine. &quot; Almost 20 years later , &quot; Ready to Wear &quot; is not nearly as unsettling , biting its broad target , but with rubber teeth . Although Altman acknowledges that fashion often is portrayed as frivolous and superficial , he is surprised by how worried some members of the fashion press were before seeing the picture . &quot; What is it I could say that would be so terrible ? &quot; he asks . Making a big deal about nothing is part and parcel of fashion on film and on television . On the_British comedy series &quot; Absolutely Fabulous , &quot; level-headed daughter Saffron ( Julia Sawalha ) says to her panic-attack-prone mother , Edina , the fashion publicist : &quot; It ' s only a fashion show . . . all you ' ve got_to do is play a bit of music , turn_on the lights , get some people who ' ve thrown_up everything they ' ve ever eaten and send them down a catwalk . . . . &quot; But to Edina ( Jennifer Saunders ) , like the characters in &quot; Ready to Wear &quot; and other fashion features , fashion is life or death . Films fuel the notion that fashion is something foisted on the public , ridiculously expensive confections shoved down women ' s throats . In &quot; Funny Face , &quot; Kay Thompson ' s deliciously dictatorial fashion editor Maggie Prescott says &quot; I want the whole country pink ! &quot; and launches into a giant &quot; Think Pink ! &quot; production number that pronounces there ' s &quot; not the slightest excuse for plum or puce . . . or chartreuse. &quot; Two minutes later , when asked if she ' ll be wearing pink , she says &quot; Me ? I would n ' t be caught dead. &quot; In other words , it ' s a power_play between fashion people and &quot; real &quot; people . Fashion people are cultured and refined , gorgeous , effortlessly thin but cadaverously cold . &quot; Face it , we ' re a cold lot , artificial and totally lacking in sentiment , &quot; Thompson says in &quot; Funny Face , &quot; when she learns that her photographer ( Fred Astaire ) has fallen_for his new model ( Audrey Hepburn ) . Love for anything but clothes or work is not acceptable . Real people , on the other hand , are often rubes with hearts of gold who never quite feel comfortable in the rarefied air of the fashion world in which they inadvertently find themselves . In &quot; The Fashion Show &quot; episode of &quot; I Love Lucy , &quot; for instance , Lucy and Ethel go dress shopping in a couture salon . More accustomed to Gimbel ' s basement , Ethel asks , &quot; Where are the racks ? What do you paw through ? &quot; Even dressed in such finery as the Don Loper original Lucy covets so fervently , they would likely not be welcome in the clique . Fashion ' s exclusionary nature is always reinforced on film , offering a glimpse of glamour but never with open arms . &quot; I figured if I put_on my new suit maybe I could join the club . I couldn ' t . I didn ' t speak the language , &quot; says unpolished sportswriter Gregory Peck in &quot; Designing Woman. &quot; Used to a crowd of poker-playing he-men , he ' s put_off by his new wife ' s ( Lauren Bacall , who is also in &quot; Ready to Wear &quot; ) circle of friends . &quot; It ' s a silly , ridiculous business , &quot; Bacall says . &quot; It pays far too_much money . You meet silly , ridiculous people . . . and I love it. &quot; For all_the ridiculousness , though , the fashion world is a safe haven for the eccentric . The world of &quot; Ready to Wear &quot; -- chock full of bisexual designers , heterosexual transvestites and pregnant nude models -- is &quot; a comfortable home for people who ' ve been ostracized , &quot; Altman says . That has always been true of fashion in real_life and in fiction . One of the funniest examples of this is the &quot; Lily Munster , Girl Model &quot; episode of &quot; The Munsters. &quot; In it , a ghoulish Lily ( Yvonne DeCarlo ) shows_up to a model &quot; go-see &quot; wearing her usual costume -- a dress spun of &quot; black_widow ' s web. &quot; Instead of frightening designer Lazlo Brastoff ( Roger C . Carmel ) , Lily enchants him with her exotic beauty . &quot; Tell the other girls to go_home , &quot; Brastoff says . Sometimes a film or a television_program does not have to be about the fashion_business to be a &quot; fashion &quot; show . Truly , &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; was all about a pair of shoes . &quot; 101 Dalmatians &quot; was about a fur_coat . Designer Isaac Mizrahi says that films like &quot; Auntie Mame &quot; with Rosalind Russell &quot; say more about fashion than fashion-industry movies often do . They say more about what people look_like at that moment. &quot; Certainly , this is true of &quot; American Gigolo , &quot; which helped boost Giorgio Armani ' s cachet in America in 1980 . Fashion practically becomes a character in some films . Jean-Paul Gaultier designed the clothes for Peter Greenaway ' s &quot; The Cook , the Thief , His Wife and Her Lover , &quot; including a dress that changes color as the wife goes from room to room , and for Pedro Almodovar ' s &quot; Kika , &quot; where the hostess of an exploitation TV news_show wears a video camera in her hat and a light-up bra to illuminate her subjects . &quot; One of the strongest things to happen to fashion was Nolan Miller ' s ' Dynasty. ' Every woman around started looking_like Joan Collins , &quot; adds Michaele Vollbracht , an artist and former fashion_designer who played himself on a fashion episode of the 1980s series &quot; Hart to Hart. &quot; Vollbracht has not seen &quot; Ready to Wear &quot; yet -- Vollbracht lives in a small_town in Florida now -- but he is disappointed when he hears that the fashion_industry is not savaged by the film . &quot; I wish it had just annihilated it , &quot; Vollbracht says with a charmingly embittered flair . &quot; But I don ' t think they could ever really get the treachery of Seventh Avenue on film . I don ' t know if the entertainment_industry knows how lethal the fashion_industry is . There ' s nothing stranger than the real_life in fashion. &quot; He ' s lived_in the world of ready to wear . He knows. *</TEXT>
