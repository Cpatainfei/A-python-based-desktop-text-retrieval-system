   <HEADLINE> O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY ; PLAINTIFFS AWAIT PAYOUT OF JUDGMENTS ; COLLECTIONS : COURT AWARDS SEIZED FROM DEFENDANTS ARE BEING WITHHELD BY THE COUNTY AUDITOR-CONTROLLER ' S OFFICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For less than $ 1 # 200 , it has hardly been worth it . But Ed Schaum believes that there is a principle involved here . The way he sees it , he won a judgment , fair and square , in an Orange County small-claims court . County officials helped him collect his money from the company he had sued . The next thing he knew , the county was holding onto the money . &quot; I was just stunned when I learned they had appropriated money that was never theirs to begin with , &quot; said Schaum , 52 , a mortgage broker in Costa Mesa . The Newport Beach resident is among an unknown number of plaintiffs awaiting perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars in court judgments that were frozen as a result of the county ' s bankruptcy , a county official said . The money , seized from defendants by the county marshal ' s office , is not being paid_out by the county auditor-controller ' s office . Such awards range from &quot; small-claims fender-bender judgments &quot; to Superior_Court judgments against large corporations , said Don Spears of the marshal ' s office . Spears , whose office enforces court_orders authorizing seizure of the money from bank_accounts and elsewhere , said that the vast majority of judgments his agency enforces are_well under $ 100 # 000 . The orders for seizure can come from courts throughout the state . Spears did not know how much money was being withheld or how many other plaintiffs are affected . No one in the auditor-controller ' s office could be reached for comment . But Spears said he learned late Wednesday that the office is planning to start releasing money collected after the bankruptcy was filed -- including Schaum ' s -- early next week . The fate of awards collected before Dec . 6 remains unclear . &quot; There ' s been no hue_and_cry &quot; among plaintiffs yet , Spears said . In fact , before a reporter made an inquiry , Spears thought that judgments were being paid as usual . Apparently , checks to plaintiffs were being issued immediately after the Dec . 6 bankruptcy filing but were stopped sometime later , he said . Schaum got the bad news just a_few days before Christmas when he called the auditor ' s office to inquire about his money . He had wanted the extra cash for the holidays . &quot; I was just astounded , &quot; he said . &quot; I said , ' What do you mean you ' re not writing any checks ? ' They said , ' We ' re broke. ' &quot; From the get-go , this has not been an easy quest_for Schaum . First , the company that owed Schaum a commission for work he did as a contractor had its accounts frozen by court_order as a result of a lawsuit by the state_attorney general ' s office . So he pursued a small-claims action against the company , Nationwide Mortgage Group Inc. , in Harbor Municipal Court to recover the $ 5 # 015 he was owed . Schaum said that he won the case Oct . 12 and that the county marshal ' s office seized the only funds it could from a company bank_account -- $ 1 # 146 and change . The money was forwarded to the county auditor ' s office for processing on Dec . 15 -- but the bucks stopped there . Schaum believes his money should have been held_in a separate account so that it would not have been affected by the county ' s financial misfortune . &quot; I think that if an attorney or a real_estate_agent or somebody in the private sector did this , it would be looked_upon as a criminal offense , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
