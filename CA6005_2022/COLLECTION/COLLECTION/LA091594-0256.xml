   <HEADLINE> TWO DECADES LATER , THE VIETNAM_WAR IS STILL A HOT TOPIC ; HISTORY : THE SHOOTING HAS STOPPED , BUT THERE ' S ENOUGH RESIDUAL INTEREST IN THE CONFLICT TO SUSTAIN A GLOSSY MAGAZINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a sunny Sunday afternoon 30 years ago , three torpedo_boats attacked the U.S. destroyer Maddox off the coast of North Vietnam . The Maddox , which had entered the Gulf of Tonkin to spy on the North Vietnamese , escaped unscathed . But the skirmish -- and a second spurious incident reported two days later -- gave President Lyndon B . Johnson all_the excuse he needed to lead the United States into its most unpopular war . By the time the last American troops withdrew on March 29 , 1973 , the war had cost about 58 # 000 American lives , had torn the American commonwealth asunder and had left a litter of unanswered questions in its wake : How did this happen ? Why did the United States lose ? What does_it mean ? The war did not end with the withdrawal of American troops . There was still the need to answer those questions , and to be reconciled to the loss . And so , even today , more_than 20 years later , the battles are still being fought . . . on the pages of Vietnam magazine . &quot; Go in-country six times a year to meet the enemy in the bush , villages , and rice_paddies , &quot; reads Vietnam ' s advertising copy . To the extent that this copy suggests this is a magazine for veterans who can ' t leave the war behind them , it is misleading . True , Vietnam is a glossy , full-color bimonthly publication that carries advertisements for everything from commemorative AK-47s to T-shirts emblazoned with President ( Taco Bill ) Clinton kissing a Vietnamese Communist ' s behind . And true , some of the articles take a definite political stance . The August issue , for example , included an essay by retired Air_Force Col . Jacksel M . Broughton , who argues that the way the United States fought the air war in the Persian_Gulf highlights the mistakes made in ' Nam . But for the most part , the magazine is a work of military history , focusing_on the strategy , tactics , armament and battles of the Vietnam_War , and written by veterans of the conflict and scholars who have studied it . For example , the August issue also included two exquisitely detailed minute-by-minute accounts of actions in the war . Retired Army Brig . Gen . James E . Shelton recounts the battle of Ong Thanh , and Army Reserve Lt . Col . James T . Root Jr . writes_about the 1st Battalion , 12th Cavalry ' s victory over the North Vietnamese Army ' s 7th and 8th battalions , 18th Regiment , at Hoa Hoi . &quot; We decided we wanted to tell the story , &quot; says Kenneth Phillips , the founding managing editor of Vietnam and now director of special projects for the Cowles History Group , which publishes Vietnam and nearly a dozen other historical magazines about everything from the Civil War to the Wild_West . &quot; We didn ' t want to tell the politics of Vietnam , &quot; he says . &quot; We didn ' t want to tell the whys and why nots . We wanted to tell the combative aspects of the Vietnam_War , what our soldiers went_through , who won which battles , that type of thing. &quot; That doesn ' t mean the magazine skirts the more painful issues . It has carried stories on My Lai , the Tet offensive , dissenters and both sides of the POW-MIA debate . &quot; Our ambition is to show the war in all its complexity , &quot; says retired Army Col . Harry G . Summers Jr. , the magazine ' s editor . The magazine was launched in the summer of 1988 , a time , Phillips says , when &quot; the anxieties , the disappointments , all_the bad things about Vietnam had kind of died down. &quot; It was an immediate success . Within a year , the demand was such_that the magazine went from four to six issues a year , and at its peak circulation went_to a high of 190 # 000 . Circulation has since leveled_off but has stayed strong at about 160 # 000 . And where initially the greatest interest had come from veterans , the magazine ' s base of subscribers has grown to include all sorts of other people , including academics and , most recently , young people . &quot; The kids now who are in their late teens , early 20s , their fathers , grandfathers fought the Vietnam_War , &quot; Phillips says . &quot; So they have a personal interest in it. &quot; * Subscribers are generally not veterans obsessed with their past , he says . &quot; The real soldier in Vietnam came_back like most soldiers and put_on his work clothes and went_back to work , and he ' s the lawyer and he ' s the doctor and he ' s this , this , this and this , &quot; Phillips says . &quot; He ' s not the guy that ' s still complaining about the war and saying , ' I can ' t get my life back together. ' that ' s not a strong majority of our readership. &quot; &quot; We try to hit the middle ground , &quot; Summers says . The magazine is &quot; not a scholarly magazine which is so dense as_to be unreadable , &quot; nor is it a &quot; ' Soldier_of_Fortune ' bang-bang shoot- ' em-up . We try to avoid first-person accounts , though every once in a while we ' ll have one in there , but we ' d rather have more dispassionate accounts that explain what happened , why and all_the rest. &quot; Summers says the magazine is putting the war into perspective , something that Summers himself has a lot of . He ' s a veteran of Korea and Vietnam . He was one of the last men off the U.S. embassy roof when Saigon fell to the Communists in 1975 . He has also written a number of books , including &quot; On Strategy : A Critical_Analysis of the Vietnam War. &quot; &quot; One of the characteristics of the Vietnam generation is the lack of historical perspective , &quot; he says . &quot; I mean the baby_boomer is sort of like the Christmas goose : They wake_up in a new_world every morning and think that the world began with them . &quot; We try to give some perspective to the Vietnam experience , because in my own view that ' s what the Vietnam vet needs more_than anything else. &quot; Phillips puts it another way : Vietnam magazine is about healing . Once people understand what American soldiers went_through in Vietnam , he says , they see them in a different light . &quot; We had a woman call_in here who wanted us to publish a letter of hers . Now this has happened more times than once , but this one particular woman I ' ll never forget . She said , ' Back in the ' 60s I was one of those people who spit on the soldier that came_back and called him a baby killer and a murderer . But after reading your magazine and seeing what he went_through , I want to apologize to the soldier. ' &quot; And the magazine , Phillips says , is a long-overdue tribute to that soldier . &quot; The average Vietnam soldier went_over there for one reason and one reason only . He went_over there because of Mom and apple_pie , the whole nine yards , you know what I mean ? Because he loved his country and he believed that his country was sending him over there for a reason , and that was to win a war . And he came_back and did not receive the recognition he should have . &quot; The Vietnam_War will go_down in history as a loss , but I can tell you one thing , this boy doesn ' t think that the Vietnam soldier lost the war. &quot; * A one-year subscription to Vietnam costs $ 15.95.
