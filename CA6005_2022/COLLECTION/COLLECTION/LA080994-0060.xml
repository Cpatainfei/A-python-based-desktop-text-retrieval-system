   <HEADLINE> DEFENSE FIGHTS MEDIA BID IN SIMPSON CASE ; COURTS : JUDGE IS ASKED TO DENY REQUEST BY NEWS ORGANIZATIONS TO VIEW PHOTOS OF VICTIMS AT THE SCENE . MATTER WILL BE CONSIDERED TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> O.J. Simpson ' s defense_lawyers have asked a Los Angeles Superior_Court judge to deny the request of several media organizations for limited access to photographs of the scene where Simpson ' s ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman were killed . The defense_lawyers contend that if the request to view the photos were granted , it probably would prejudice Simpson ' s right to a fair trial and make_it more difficult to impanel an impartial jury . Simpson ' s attorneys also urged that Judge Lance A . Ito deny the media organizations ' request to unseal transcripts of closed conferences held by another judge during Simpson ' s preliminary hearing . &quot; Because the prejudicial value of the requested materials is great , the disclosure of the requested evidence would stifle the ability of both the defense and the prosecution . . . to impanel an impartial jury , especially in light of the unprecedented extent of the publicity generated in this case , &quot; according to a brief filed Monday by Carl E . Douglas , one of Simpson ' s 10 attorneys . The brief was filed_in response to a motion by Cable News Network , CBS , the Copley Press , the Los Angeles Times , Newsweek and USA Today asking_for access to the material . Judge Ito is scheduled to hear the motion today . During Simpson ' s preliminary hearing last month , photos of the bloody bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were shown to witnesses who had found the bodies . But they were presented in such a way that they could not be seen by the courtroom audience , shown on live television or reproduced in any way . &quot; I just feel that if the media does have access to ( the photos ) . . . they will show ( them ) every time they talk_about the case . . . that it ' s just better , more prudent to not release the crime scene photos , &quot; Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell said during a closed July 5 hearing , the transcript of which subsequently became public . However , photos of pools of blood and a bloody glove were shown publicly . On July 29 , Los Angeles attorney Kelli I . Sager , representing the media organizations , formally asked Ito to allow the organizations &quot; to have access to photographs used at the preliminary hearing , solely for the limited purpose of viewing the photographs , without making copies , videotaping or otherwise replicating the exhibits. &quot; She said the public and the press have a right to access under the 1st Amendment to judicial_proceedings , including transcripts and other records of preliminary hearings , which can only be overcome by a showing that &quot; closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to that interest. &quot; Sager said that there has been no such showing in this case . However , Simpson ' s lawyers retorted that there is no presumption of openness regarding the photographs because they were not shown at the preliminary hearing . * Meanwhile , police sources downplayed the significance of an ice_cream vendor ' s account of seeing Nicole Simpson on the evening of her death and of a partially frozen_dessert found after her body was discovered . Bill Chang , the store manager of a Brentwood Ben &amp; Jerry ' s ice_cream store , on Sunday said Nicole Simpson and an unidentified man came_into the store with her children on the night of June 12 . Although sources close to the case said a police_officer at the scene reported that a small container of a partially melted dessert was found inside Nicole Simpson ' s condominium , law_enforcement sources said there is no evidence supporting a defense theory that Nicole Simpson and Goldman were therefore alive later than police and prosecutors have suggested . The evening was cool and police sources said that the officer who noticed the dessert did not document the extent to which it had melted . Moreover , any suggestion that the victims were alive after about 10:30 p.m. is contradicted by other , more solid evidence in the case , police said . During the preliminary hearing , a witness testified that he found Nicole Simpson ' s dog wandering in the neighborhood with bloody paws about 10:35 p.m. , which police take as convincing evidence that the two victims had been killed by then . The timing is important because prosecutors have sought to show that Simpson could have committed the killings and still made_it home_in time to meet a limousine that took him to the airport later that night . At the preliminary hearing , the limousine driver said he buzzed Simpson ' s intercom for about 15 minutes without getting an answer before noticing a shadowy figure striding across the football superstar ' s lawn shortly before 11 p.m. on June 12 . That figure disappeared into Simpson ' s home and moments later Simpson answered the intercom , the driver testified . The chauffeur said he and Simpson left for the airport about 11:15 or 11:20 p.m. , rushing so that Simpson could catch an 11:45 p.m. flight for Chicago . In another Simpson-related media controversy , the New Yorker magazine , responding to a threatened lawsuit by Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman , has offered to publish a letter from Fuhrman . In its July 25 issue , the New Yorker quoted anonymous members of the Simpson defense_team calling Fuhrman a racist and a &quot; bad cop , &quot; who might have planted a key piece of evidence to be hailed as &quot; the hero of the case. &quot; * Fuhrman ' s attorneys , Robert H . Tourtelot and Laurie J . Butler , wrote to the New Yorker last week demanding a correction of what they called the &quot; bald and untruthful claim &quot; that the detective planted evidence . After the New Yorker article was published , police sources said that it would have been all but impossible for Fuhrman to have taken a bloody glove from the crime scene and transported it to Simpson ' s home , but those sources were not quoted in the New Yorker piece . In response to Tourtelot ' s letter , a New Yorker lawyer said the magazine continues to believe the article was &quot; consistent with the highest standards , ethics and traditions of American journalism , &quot; but offered to publish a letter from Fuhrman or his lawyers explaining their position . The letter would be followed by comment from the magazine , the New Yorker attorney stated . &quot; I would urge you and your client to give serious consideration to this alternative , &quot; attorney Devereux Chatillon said in a letter dated Aug . 5 . &quot; It would allow Detective Fuhrman ' s views and feelings to be expressed publicly and in words he chooses or approves. &quot; Chatillon also warned Fuhrman ' s attorneys against pursuing a lawsuit , stating that &quot; such litigation can be destructive and can have the paradoxical effect of extending the life of a public controversy long after it otherwise would have faded. &quot;</TEXT>
