   <HEADLINE> EXXON ORDERED TO PAY $ 5 BILLION FOR OIL SPILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A jury in Alaska on Friday ordered Exxon Corp . to pay $ 5 billion -- roughly what the company makes in a year -- as punishment for its recklessness in causing the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The 11-member federal jury in Anchorage also assessed $ 5 # 000 against Joseph Hazelwood , who was captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it ran_aground in Alaska ' s Prince William Sound on March 24 , 1989 , dumping 11 million gallons of crude_oil into one of North_America ' s richest fisheries . Although it is believed to be the largest punitive judgment ever , Friday ' s award was_well below the $ 15 billion sought by the plaintiffs -- an estimated 30 # 000 fishermen , Alaskan natives , property_owners and other residents . While huge , the award will not seriously threaten Exxon ' s financial health , investment analysts said . &quot; Exxon is the most profitable company on earth , the highest net_income , &quot; said J . Robinson West , president and CEO of Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co . &quot; One should not trivialize $ 5 billion , but this company has the strength to survive this . Not many companies could. &quot; In addition , Exxon vowed to appeal . &quot; This verdict is totally unwarranted and unfair , &quot; Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond said in a statement Friday . He added : &quot; It is excessive by any legal or practical measure . We will use every legal means available to overturn this unjust verdict , which is not a final_judgment . It will be reviewed and we trust it will be modified by the trial_court or by appellate courts. &quot; Plaintiffs ' lawyer David W . Oesting said that Exxon ' s appeals might last another two to three years , but he predicted that the full award would be upheld . Friday ' s judgment is believed to be the largest punitive award ever , although it is not record-setting in terms of total damages . A Texas jury in 1985 hit Texaco with a $ 10.53-billion judgment for interfering with Pennzoil Co. ' s attempt to purchase Getty Oil Co. , but only $ 3 billion of that was punitive . Friday ' s verdict capped a grim summer in court for Exxon . In three consecutive trials , Exxon suffered major setbacks . In June , the Anchorage jury found Exxon and Capt . Hazelwood to have been recklessly negligent , meaning that punitive damages could be awarded on top of actual costs to plaintiffs . In August , the jury awarded commercial fishermen $ 287 million for actual damages to their livelihood . This was less than a third of what the fishermen had asked_for , and Exxon quickly announced that it considers that subject_to adjustment , &quot; including a reduction to reflect payments already made by Exxon to many of the plaintiffs. &quot; Shortly after the spill , Exxon announced a claims program in which it paid_out $ 300 million to more_than 11 # 000 parties , some of whom were represented in this case . At the time of the second trial , Exxon also arrived_at an independent settlement to pay 3 # 500 native Alaskans $ 20 million in place of food they would normally have caught in Alaskan waters . Raymond , the Exxon chairman , said the company has also paid about $ 3.5 billion in cleanup costs , government fines and damage claims relating to the spill . The plaintiffs ' first reaction when they were reached Friday afternoon was to speculate if the award would be enough to make Exxon squirm . In the past five years , the region has suffered poor salmon runs , shuttered fish processing plants , polluted fish farms , bankruptcies , divorce and even suicide . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s enough , but it should inflict some pain . There has to be retribution for what they did to us , &quot; said Jim Gray , a 48-year-old fisherman who led close to 100 boats last summer in a vain effort to blockade oil_tankers trying to reach the now infamous oil terminus at Valdez in Prince William Sound . &quot; Exxon came_after the spill and said , ' Don ' t worry , we ' ll make you whole. ' Then they turned_around and fought us . You have a lot of resentment here. &quot; In the fishing village of Cordova , whose economy was hit hard by the spill , salmon fisherman Max McCarty had just spent Friday morning at the docks in pouring rain pulling the nets off his fishing_boat when he heard about the verdict . &quot; It didn ' t thrill me that much , &quot; McCarty said . &quot; You know Exxon is going_to fight this every penny of the way. &quot; Chuck Totemkoff , president of Chenega Corp. , an Alaskan native village corporation , was similarly restrained . &quot; We are finally seeing some justice , &quot; he said . &quot; But there are some things that can never be the same again. &quot; With fish scarce and few ducks or sea_lions to hunt since the oil spill , said Totemkoff , the natives have been prevented from practicing subsistence fishing and hunting methods that have continued for thousands of years . &quot; There has been a break_in that chain . There is a danger we won ' t be able to pass_on the knowledge. &quot; Times staff writer Leslie Helm in Seattle contributed to this story .</TEXT>
