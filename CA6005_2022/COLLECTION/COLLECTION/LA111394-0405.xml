   <TEXT> A federal mediator has been asked to help employees of the nonprofit Plaza de la Raza performing arts center and its board of directors reach a contract agreement after several months of failed negotiations . The employees , who voted to join the California Professional Employees Union last December , have been working without a contract since then and fear for their job security , said union_representative Chris Graeber . The six employees , all non-teaching support staff , decided to join the union because they worried that their benefits and wages would be cut as the organization tightened its budget . &quot; Plaza wants to reduce staff and their hours , and we have major concerns about that , &quot; Graeber said . &quot; Management isn ' t doing much to solve the problems. &quot; Lydia Lopez , board president and interim director , did not return phone_calls last week . She replaced former director Gema Sandoval , who left in July to concentrate_on her dance troupe . Joseph Medine , who works for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , an independent agency of the federal_government , met with both sides Thursday . He declined to comment on the negotiations , saying he wants to remain neutral . The union , which represents more_than 700 members of nonprofit organizations , has requested a three-year contract for support employees -- not including teachers -- increases in wages and benefits , and an updated personnel policy . Graeber said the union requested a mediator two months ago when the board proposed reducing staff and hours before a contract was drawn_up . Medine had held a meeting before Thursday ' s but no agreement was reached . Plaza de la Raza ' s School of Performing and Visual Arts , an after-school program established in 1978 , has an enrollment of 300 to 600 music , art , dance and drama students . The Plaza , located at Lincoln Park , also holds public performances at its outdoor_stage and in the Margo Albert Theater . MARY ANNE PEREZ</TEXT>
