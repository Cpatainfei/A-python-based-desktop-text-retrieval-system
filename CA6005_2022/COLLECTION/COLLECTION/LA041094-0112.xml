   <HEADLINE> TARIK AZIZ ; IRAQ ' S DEPUTY PRIME_MINISTER STRUGGLES AGAINST THE U.N. EMBARGO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a nation deeply suspicious of the outside world , Iraq has produced a remarkable crop of diplomats . Controlled by a dictator , Saddam Hussein , who has spent only five days outside Iraq , and run from a capital , Baghdad , that has been described as an Arab East Berlin ( before reunification ) , over the years the Iraqi Foreign Service has still managed to assemble a corps of diplomats often acknowledged to be among the best outside Europe and the Americas . In a further anomaly , it was a Christian , Tarik Aziz , who in 1983 , became this overwhelmingly Moslem country ' s chief foreign-policy spokesman . First as foreign_minister , and now , as deputy prime_minister , the courtly , 57-year-old Aziz runs Iraq ' s day-to-day diplomacy . Last month , he was in New York for meetings at the United Nations . And for the first time since the end of the Gulf War , he is able to report progress in his efforts to free Iraq from the ring of economic and political sanctions that the United States has managed to maintain . Clearly relishing the prospect that Iraq may soon be able to export millions of barrels of oil , Aziz was only too pleased to describe the ways and means of his successful diplomacy . Eighteen times previously , the U.N. Security_Council had met and ruled -- without dissent -- that Iraq had not complied with a post-war resolution requiring that all its weapons of mass destruction be dismantled . These include chemical and biological weapons and , of course , its nuclear-weapons program . Without such a finding , and an agreement allowing a permanent outside monitoring system , Iraq would continue under a world-wide embargo . Until last year , the Iraqis were anything but cooperative . They repeatedly challenged U.N. teams sent to inspect military sites and blustered about violations of their sovereignty . But during a visit by a senior U.N. official last summer , Aziz extracted a pledge that if Iraq were to cooperate , the United Nations would allow Baghdad to resume unrestricted sale of its crude_oil . With oil reserves second only to Saudi_Arabia , a return of Iraqi oil exports will mean a shift for commercial markets , not to mention Middle_East politics . The interview took_place in an elegant townhouse on Manhattan ' s upper East_Side , the official residence of the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations , Nizar Hamdoon . Burly security_guards patrol the hallways . Hussein ' s ubiquitous visage stares_down in nearly every room . However , there was a slightly jarring detail in the reception_room where the conversation took_place . On a small table where Aziz placed his cigar and pipe and Hamdoon his cigarettes -- both are big smokers -- was a silver-framed picture of Hamdoon , then ambassador in Washington , with a smiling President George_Bush . Question : Do you believe the Security_Council members see a shift in your behavior ? Answer : We have been cooperating with the council . We have been implementing U.N. resolutions -- but this has not been acknowledged in the past . Under the pressure of the Americans , all_the achievements of Iraq were obscured , were denied . But that has come_to an end . That biased attitude has come_to an end . Now more and more delegations in the Security_Council are listening to us . . . . The only obstinate position is the position of the United States . Q : And Britain . A : And , of course , Britain is supporting the United States . Though Britain is showing a . . . limited understanding of the position of Iraq -- they listen to us at least . I met with the_British ambassador and we had a session with the_British delegation in which we explained what we have achieved . So this is a bit positive . Q : What about France ? Key U.S. officials single_out France , and go so far as_to say there has been coordination between France and Iraq on a common approach to get the United Nations to lift the embargo . A : Well , technically speaking , there has been no coordination . . . . But we have explained our position to the_French . . . and they showed understanding . Q : In Washington , the_French are singled_out in part because two of their oil_companies are thought to be in a position to benefit from Iraq ' s return to the oil market . A : Well , the_French do have interests in Iraq . . . . It ' s not strange that a country like France would look_at its legitimate interests with Iraq . We used to do clean business with them and we intend to resume a clean business . Q : You must be aware of the talk in the oil_industry of deals you are_on the verge of signing with the_French . A : Yes , yes , this is correct . Q : In your letter to the Security_Council president , you only make an oblique reference_to an issue even the_French emphasize -- the need for Iraq to recognize Kuwait ' s border . How do you plan to address this issue ? A : Well , I understand the_French position and the position expressed by other members . . . . ( But ) we said now the main issue for Iraq is to see that its rights and its sovereignty are respected . When the sovereignty of Iraq and the legitimate rights of Iraq . . . are respected by the council , then Iraq will abide_by the rules of international_law . . . . Q : So , if I understand you clearly , the embargo against Iraq would have to be lifted before you will address the question of the border between Iraq and Kuwait . A : Well , we are not putting it in the sense of before and after , because there is a biased treatment by a number of members of the council -- mainly the United States , first and foremost . This treatment is , first of all , infringing on the sovereignty of Iraq by the implementation of no-fly zones in the north , no-fly zones in the south , the interference in our internal affairs -- as it has been officially acknowledged by ( National Security Adviser ) Tony Lake in his article in &quot; Foreign Affairs &quot; -- without justification , against the letter and spirit of U.N. resolutions , is blocking the lifting of the sanctions . So in such circumstances , Iraq would like to see that its rights are respected . . . . When that is the case , of course , Iraq would feel that it ' s not being threatened , Iraq would feel that it ' s not being hurt . In such a climate Iraq would be ready to consider solving all_of the remaining problems . Q : One problem the_British and Americans have is Iraq ' s seeming inability to accept the permanence of Kuwait . For example , the Iraqi media continue to refer to Kuwait as Iraq ' s 19th province . A : The media does not always represent the official position of the government of Iraq . The media is the media . Q : But it ' s hard to believe -- A : I ' m the spokesman of the Iraqi government . I have said that this chapter is closed . This is the position of the government of Iraq . No official spokesman on the side of Iraq contradicted what I said . About the media , . . . this talk has stopped . If you will follow and observe what ' s being said in the Iraqi media , you would n ' t find these things . . . Q : Now that you ' ve made some gains at the U.N. , what is the next part of your strategy , particularly toward the United States ? A : We would like to have normal relations with the United States of America . We have said that we would not want to be enemies of the United States . . . . But we think the United States has to reconsider its position because it ' s wrong , it ' s illegal and its becoming a minority position in the Security_Council . Q : As a practical matter , can you imagine the U.S._government , just three years after the end of the war when the same leadership is still in place in Baghdad , changing its policy toward Iraq and allowing you to sell massive amounts of oil ? A : Well , that ' s up_to the Administration to decide . This is the right of Iraq according to resolutions that were written by the United States itself . The United States wrote those resolutions and we have implemented those resolutions , so ( if ) they change their positions they will find themselves in an awkward situation . Q : OK , but I don ' t understand how that gets you to your goal of selling oil . A : I think that if the United States continues its position in blocking the process in the Security_Council , the very rationale , the raison d ' etre of the resolutions would be damaged . And they will lose their credibility . And when a resolution loses its credibility because of the behavior of a single member , then the result will be that international public_opinion will change its attitude toward Iraq . This will be similar to the unilateral position of the United States vis-a-vis Cuba . The United States is imposing an embargo on Cuba but the world is not imposing an embargo on Cuba . You see , now Iraq is under embargo because there is a U.N. resolution . Even the Philippines is implementing it . Argentina is implementing it . Venezuela , Norway . But when Iraq implements its obligations according to the U.N. resolution , then why should the international community boycott Iraq ? It will be just an American position , and if I were in the place of the American Administration I would n ' t love to find myself isolated and in the minority . Q : Considering your experience in dealing with the previous Administration , especially in the negotiations before the war , how do you rate the performance of this Administration ' s -- A : Amateurs ! Q : -- who are running day-to day policy . A : They have this foolish policy of dual containment . that ' s just a theory put_on paper -- but in practice who is being contained ? First of all , Iran is not contained by any means . Iran can buy whatever it wants from all_over the world . It has money . It has borders . It has ports . There is no containment on Iran . And even Iraq is not contained in the sense Tony Lake mentioned in his article . A nation is not a bunch of chickens to put_in a cage and contain it and feed it , give it the small amounts of food you would like to give it . This is very arrogant and shallow kind of thinking . Q : Is there a point when you will no longer take the diplomatic approach you are taking now ? Is there a time_limit ? A : We are told , &quot; You have to comply with this resolution. &quot; We comply . Then , in spite of the compliance , one powerful member says , &quot; No , I ' m not going_to do my share. &quot; So then why should we comply with ( other ) resolutions ? Then Iraq will act according to what the situation is . They have to know that , you see . Q : Do you have any doubt that the United States will do all it can to isolate Iraq as long as the present regime is in power ? A : But Iraq is not isolated . The isolation is breaking gradually . Now we are reviving our contact with many countries who were boycotting us in the past . . . . The other countries are not acting according to this obsession . Iraq is Iraq , you know , whoever leads Iraq that ' s up_to the Iraqi people . . . . I don ' t know what ' s behind this obsession in the position of the United States . They have been just wasting their time and efforts and money trying to achieve what they cannot achieve . The Iraqi people are not going_to change their government because some people in the White_House or the State_Department don ' t like their government . Q : Does the government feel any pressure because of the economic situation ? A : No , the pressure will not be in the direction to give concessions at the expense of sovereignty . No , no the people of Iraq will not accept to give_up their sovereignty . Somalia didn ' t accept to give_up its sovereignty , and Iraq is much better than Somalia . Q : Do you now believe that in six months or so Iraqi oil will be back on the international market ? A : Iraq cannot be excluded forever from that market . It ' s up_to the other parties to accommodate themselves . Q : How do you think other countries , like Saudi_Arabia , feel about the return of Iraq ? A : They will have to accommodate themselves to reality . Iraq will be back . Sooner or later , Iraq will be back .</TEXT>
