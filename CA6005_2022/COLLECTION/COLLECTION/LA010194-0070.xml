   <HEADLINE> DROP IN CRIME STATISTICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * For several months now I have observed that your own reports of crimes committed in Los Angeles show a consistent decline from 1992 ' s numbers . Despite this your reporters persist_in telling readers that crime is growing , exploding or out of control . Mostly this seemed a curiosity , probably due_to indifferent background researches . However , your article on the latest FBI Crime Index report ( Dec . 6 ) is beyond curious . If one persists_in reading to the end of the report , he or she might learn that there has been a substantial reduction in crime . This good news , is , however , apparently so unpalatable to those who make careers out of crime ( and I ' m not talking_about &quot; criminals &quot; ) that they can ' t face the possibility that crime is declining . The FBI director denies his bureau ' s own reports and suspects underreporting ; politicians announce that any decline is not enough ; those jockeying for positions for future candidacies warn that the decline is temporary . Worst , your reporter buries the good news behind this barrage of pessimism and nonsense . Tell people the truth . Both the FBI Index and the Census_Bureau survey demonstrate a significant decline in crime and victimization , including violent crime . If these statistics are viewed over a longer run the public would understand that crime is not out of control nor is our present situation that unusual . In fact , most of the alleged increase in violent crime is the result of legislative re-categorization of domestic violence rather than of any true increase in violent acts . The crime lobby ( law_enforcement , politicians , prosecutors , correctional officers and others who make a pretty good living off of crime ) will not easily give_up the nice sinecure they enjoy . They will fan public hysteria and we will end_up going bankrupt out of unfounded fear . This is nothing new . On Feb . 8 , 1775 , the Pennsylvania Gazette ran the following : &quot; Lost is our old simplicity of times , The world abounds with laws , and teems with crimes. &quot; The author was probably running_for city_council .
