   <HEADLINE> ON CALIFORNIA : ' OZZIE AND HARRIET ' -- AN EPILOGUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Harriet Nelson had died , and somehow it seemed appropriate last week to visit the house . Across 14 television seasons , this graceful Cape_Cod Colonial had served both as the Nelson family home and as an exterior prop for &quot; The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. &quot; It was painted white then . Today , the wood siding is blue . There were white picket_fences in the show . Today , the house is surrounded by a barrier of black iron . Signs hung from the fence deliver a warning : &quot; Armed Response. &quot; Ozzie Nelson passed_away some 20 years ago in an upstairs room , and the new owner has been told the patriarch of &quot; America ' s Favorite Family &quot; haunts the place today . The evidence is an ice_cream dipper that moves mysteriously from drawer to drawer . Ozzie loved ice_cream . Harriet sold the home_in the late 1970s . A plastic_surgeon owned it for a time . The new owner is a record company executive . He and his wife are deep into a loving restoration . &quot; It is our home now , &quot; the young_man says , standing in the freshly painted kitchen where Harriet Nelson once reigned as matriarch of a new American lifestyle . &quot; We want to have our own Ozzie and Harriet life take_place in this home . Everybody wants that , don ' t they ? &quot; Isn ' t that the dream ? &quot; * Suburbia was not invented in California , although no other state so feverishly championed the form . Television , too , was a transplanted creation . What California , what Hollywood -- what , in fact , Ozzie Nelson -- did create was a genre of television_show , the family sitcom , and it in turn nurtured what the new owner of the Nelson home calls , quite accurately , &quot; the dream. &quot; It was a dream of white picket_fences and square green yards and a bedroom for every well-mannered child . It was a dream of safe neighborhoods where boys named Rick and Bud and Beav could roam happy and free . Dads wore suits and kept short hours in jobs that never were quite defined . Moms could be found in the new , all-electric kitchen , with milk and cookies and enough wisdom and guile to make everything all_right by episode ' s end . Everyone was white . In a sense , these were training films . &quot; Ozzie and Harriet &quot; and the programs it inspired offered instruction in how to live_in the postwar suburbs just beginning to flood_out from American cities . Episodes were built around such dilemmas as how to persuade a neighbor to bring_back a borrowed garden_rake . The new life brought new tools , and the new tools took some adaptation . In one episode , Harriet can be seen in a commercial break carefully demonstrating how to load dishes into a dishwasher . &quot; I always say , &quot; she tells the audience , &quot; there is nothing like a dishwasher to keep a home a happy one. &quot; In his book , &quot; The Fifties , &quot; David Halberstam examined the role of the Nelsons , Cleavers and the rest : &quot; These families were living the new social_contract as created by . . . suburban developers . The American_dream was now located in the suburbs , and for millions of Americans , still living_in urban apartments . . . these shows often seemed to be beamed from a foreign country , but one that the viewers longed to be a part of . These families were optimistic . There was a conviction , unstated but always there , that life was good and was going_to get better. &quot; * Viewed today , these banal sitcoms produce an almost opposite effect : They mock the dreams they once planted . Too_much has gone_down behind the white picket_fence . Moms no longer are confined to the kitchen , and any dad who keeps Ozzie hours in this corporate world is headed for the layoff list . Optimism is in short supply , replaced by restlessness . New suburbs , of course , still get built willy-nilly , but only to replace older ones already gone_to seed . One unintended message of &quot; Ozzie and Harriet &quot; -- &quot; If you want a message , &quot; Ozzie is said to have once told David , the eldest son , &quot; call Western Union &quot; -- was that it was possible to run . Then the suburbs seemed far enough . Today those who take_flight head for Idaho , and it ' s doubtful even that gets the job done . Which returns us to the house . It is located , ironically enough , not in suburbia at all , but in the Hollywood Hills , on a cul-de-sac of a half-dozen fine old homes . At the bottom of the block sits dread Hollywood -- apartments , crime , gangs , the works . The new owner stands outside in the darkness and contemplates this potential intrusion upon his &quot; Ozzie and Harriet life. &quot; If it gets too_bad , he muses , they might need to throw_up a fence down at the corner , to turn the block where the Nelsons once lived into one of those gated communities . And thus is the old dream remodeled .</TEXT>
