   <HEADLINE> SKATING PANEL CALLS HEARING ON HARDING CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tonya Harding moved one step closer Saturday to possible expulsion from the U.S. Olympic team when a U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . panel unanimously called_for a disciplinary hearing to determine the extent of her role in the Jan . 6 attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan . The panel ' s hearing procedure allows 30 days for Harding to respond to its statement of charges . The figure_skating team is officially named on Feb . 21 , so that leaves the decision on Harding ' s participation in the hands of the U.S. Olympic Committee . The USOC can suspend her from the team after its own hearing . USOC officials in Lillehammer , Norway , said Saturday that they will decide later this week whether to call a hearing of the 13-member Games Administrative Board to determine Harding ' s status . Such a hearing , they said , would be held_in Norway within the next two weeks . The opening ceremony for the Winter_Olympics is Saturday in Lillehammer . Some USOC officials , who did not want to be identified , told The Times that it is virtually certain that the hearing will occur but that the organization is exercising caution until all_of the legal ramifications are explored . &quot; We ' re trying to get as much information as possible , &quot; USOC Executive_Director Harvey Schiller said . &quot; It ' s important that the entire matter be given as much consideration as we can. &quot; The USOC was put_in this position when the five-member figure_skating panel said there was reasonable grounds to believe that Harding , the U.S. national champion , violated the association ' s code of ethics . But because of the USFSA ' s 30-day hearing period , the decision on Harding ' s status for the Olympics was left to be determined by the USOC . The figure_skating panel determined that Harding &quot; committed an act , made a statement , or engaged in conduct detrimental to the welfare of figure_skating and / or failed to exemplify the highest standards of fairness , ethical behavior and genuine good sportsmanship in her relations with others. &quot; The panel also found that Harding &quot; committed an act to carry_out a plan and / or was involved in a plan to injure Nancy Kerrigan ; or knew about a plan to injure Nancy Kerrigan and either failed to oppose it , failed to report it , or made false_statements about her knowledge concerning it. &quot; William Hybl , the panel ' s chairman , said if Harding does not respond within 30 days , the disciplinary hearing will be held without her . The USOC must submit names for the figure_skating competition on Feb . 21 . The figure_skating panel will now give the USOC more_than 300 pages of documents and several videotapes to assist in its decision . &quot; The ball ' s back in the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s court , &quot; Hybl said . According to USFSA rules , President Claire Ferguson could have removed Harding from the Olympic team after hearing the panel ' s findings . But she chose to defer action . &quot; Until she ( Harding ) has had her fair chance at the hearing panel to make her statements and ask her questions , it would be wrong for me to take a position to kick her off the team , &quot; Ferguson said . After the USFSA announcement , Harding emerged from the Portland , Ore. , apartment where she is staying with a friend but said nothing to reporters who are maintaining a daily stakeout there . Her primary attorneys , Dennis Rawlinson and Robert Weaver Jr. , issued a brief statement : &quot; USFSA does not conclude that Ms . Harding has in any way been involved in any wrongdoing or in any way violated its code of ethics . The statement of charges is based upon conflicting evidence , including , in part , allegations by ( Harding ' s ex-husband ) Jeff Gillooly and ( her ex-bodyguard ) Shawn Eckardt , which Tonya has denied , &quot; the lawyers said . &quot; Tonya Harding will respond to the statement in compliance with the bylaws and rules of the USFSA . We would like to thank the USFSA for strictly adhering to its bylaws and rules. &quot; Another of her attorneys , Brian Burton , earlier remarked : &quot; Obviously we ' re not happy that they decided it was sufficient to proceed . But we ' re not overly concerned at this point. &quot; Hybl , past president of the USOC , said the USFSA panel members took great pains to ensure that Harding ' s rights were protected . Sharon Watson of Los Angeles , chairwoman of the USFSA ' s sanctions and eligibility committee and a member of the USFSA ' s board of directors , said the decision was difficult . &quot; It ' s painful to see someone who has spent her whole life training for this and whose future in a sense is resting_on this , &quot; she said . &quot; We had to be sure we gave her a fair shake . &quot; On the other hand , seeing something like this happen in our sport and happen to Nancy . . . it ' s a real tragedy. &quot; Ken Schweitzer , athletic director of the Air_Force_Academy , said that as the panel examined the evidence it was apparent &quot; not everything was right. &quot; &quot; I think the message we send is loud and clear , and it is very important for athletics across the spectrum , &quot; Schweitzer said . Kerrigan , a Bronze Medal_winner at the 1992 Games in Albertville , France , was clubbed on the right leg on Jan . 6 in Detroit . The attack the day before competition knocked her out of the U.S. Figure_Skating National Championships . But the USFSA named her to the U.S. team anyway . Harding later acknowledged she learned after the attack that people close to her were involved but that she failed to report immediately to authorities what she knew . Gillooly has pleaded guilty to racketeering in the attack , and three other men have confessed to taking_part . Harding has not been charged and denies any involvement , but Gillooly and one of the alleged conspirators have implicated her . The hearing panel , which also will determine any disciplinary measures , reviewed 20 areas of evidence in making its decision . Some of the evidence was uncovered by the panel ' s counsel , John Bennett , a former Portland prosecutor . Hybl said Bennett , working with a private_investigator , is conducting an independent investigation into the allegations on behalf of the panel . &quot; We have some specific questions and charges that John is looking_at , &quot; Hybl said . &quot; We need to tie_up some loose ends. &quot; Hybl also said that the panel took_into_account Harding ' s history as a representative of the USFSA . He refused to elaborate on why Harding ' s past was a factor_in the panel ' s conclusions . If the USOC calls a hearing in Norway , Harding would be invited to appear before the board , as required by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 . Schiller said Harding ' s attorneys were informed of the possibility of a hearing but would not say if their client would appear . &quot; I would expect her to come , &quot; said John Ruger , the chairman of the USOC ' s athletes ' advisory council and a member of the Games Administrative Board . &quot; Whether that will make a difference or not remains to be seen . She didn ' t go_to Colorado Springs . I don ' t know if that worked for her or against her. &quot; In her last major public statement Jan . 27 on the Kerrigan attack , Harding had pleaded to stay_on the Olympic team , saying she was not involved in the attack and had done &quot; nothing to violate the standards of excellence , of sportsmanship that are expected in an Olympic athlete. &quot; One member of the Games Administrative Board is USOC Vice_President George Steinbrenner , who contributed $ 20 # 000 to Harding before this year ' s national championships . Schiller said he did not believe that Steinbrenner ' s presence on the board represents a conflict_of_interest . &quot; We don ' t think it would be inappropriate for him to participate in any function of the USOC , &quot; Schiller said . He pointed_out that Steinbrenner has contributed money to many amateur athletes , including figure skater Michelle Kwan of Torrance , who received $ 7 # 000 from the New York Yankees owner last year . If Harding does not skate in either the Olympics or in the World Championships , she will be replaced by Kwan , the first alternate , because of her second-place finish in the national championships . Harding scheduled no skating practice this weekend but reserved after-hours time at her local rink Monday through Friday . It has not been disclosed when she is scheduled to leave Oregon for Norway . Prosecutors in Portland , meanwhile , said that the grand_jury investigation of the attack on Kerrigan would continue next week and &quot; at least &quot; into the following week . Almond reported from Colorado Springs and Harvey from Lillehammer , Norway . Times staff writer John Balzar in Portland contributed to this story .
