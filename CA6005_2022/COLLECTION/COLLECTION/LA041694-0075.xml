   <HEADLINE> ARE THE SERBS HUMILIATING NATO ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The United Nations has made a catastrophic mistake , &quot; Bosnian Serb political_leader Radovan Karadzic said last week of last Sunday ' s NATO air strike against Serbian forces besieging Gorazde . &quot; We have won . That is why they are angry with us . With this they have put their last card on the table . Now they will have to send land forces to fight with us. &quot; The statement , over Serbian radio , was a preemptive rhetorical strike . The Serbs may , in fact , be terrified of a sustained NATO air onslaught . But they know the Americans are loath to begin a ground war . By equating air war with inevitable ground war , Karadzic sought to stop both at once . As of late Friday , the tactic was working . U.N. officials in Gorazde were reporting imminent Serb victory there . But U.S. officials , refusing to accept the U.N. reports , said that no NATO strikes were in prospect . If the Serbs do take Gorazde , they will have humiliated NATO as well as the United Nations and , in the bargain , mocked the Russians , whose negotiator , Vitaly Churkin , had claimed as recently as Wednesday , &quot; I got assurances from the Bosnian Serb leadership that it was not in their intention to conduct offensive operation in the Gorazde area or shell the town. &quot; That Bosnian Serb mockery of Russian mediation will permit Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the militarist Russian right to mock President Boris N . Yeltsin and call_for a more aggressive stance toward the West . NATO , its lack of resolve laid bare , will deter such moves less effectively . The United States will also be seen as weaker outside Europe . On Friday , ironically , the official U.N. commission on war_crimes in the former Yugoslavia concluded in its final report that the Serbs had committed genocide against the Muslims in northern Bosnia . The Serbian goal , to quote a Serbian election slogan , is &quot; Mobilization and Homogenization . &quot; That call_for homogenization constitutes a death sentence against non-Serbs not metaphorically but , as the U.N. report proves , literally . With death by ethnic cleansing their only alternative to death in a guerrilla war , the Bosnian Muslims are likely to fight on as long as they have a bullet left to fire . Nothing NATO does or fails to do will change that fact . Russia , offended by NATO ' s action last Sunday , has backed_away from President Clinton ' s NATO-adjacent Partnership for Peace . A Russia-NATO partnership -- if , against the odds , one could be forged in the crucible of this moment -- could surely impose a cease-fire in Bosnia and dictate terms that none of the parties could reject . But with or without Russia , NATO would be wise_to call Karadzic ' s bluff , abandon the pretense of neutrality , step into the breach opened by the besieged , conflict-ridden and collapsing United Nations and sharply escalate the air war against the Serbs . By now , the situation may be lose-lose , but the greater loss will be what now impends : capitulation to a band of thugs trying in every way to conceal their vulnerability to open-ended air war .</TEXT>
