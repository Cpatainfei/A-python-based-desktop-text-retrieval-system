   <HEADLINE> POWER TURBINE PROJECT SAVES TECH CENTER FROM CLOSING ; ENGINEERING : THE THERMODYNAMICS TESTING PROGRAM WILL KEEP THE FACILITY WORKING AND SAVE 200 JOBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Department_of_Energy announced Thursday that it will keep_open its Energy Technology Engineering Center near Simi Valley for research in a promising new technology for electrical_power generation , known as the Kalina Cycle . The center had been scheduled to be closed_in September , with a loss of 200 high-tech jobs . It is operated by the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International , which for decades tested components for nuclear_power plants at the site . &quot; The issue in my mind was that we cannot lose this resource , &quot; Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said Thursday at a news_conference in Los Angeles . The center , part of DOE ' s Santa Susana Field Laboratory , is now assured of support through 1995 , and will get a budget hike of $ 11.6 million , most of it to test the new technology , a prototype of which is already in place . Community groups and proponents of an advanced transportation industry in Southern California have been lobbying hard to keep the site open . In December , DOE successfully sought_out industrial partners to help support the center ' s continued operation . &quot; We ' re happy to hear this announcement , because there was concern that time was running_out , &quot; said John Slifko , special assistant for technology policy to Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) . &quot; We still think that a focus_on transportation technologies is a premiere use of the site , and we will be working to get DOE ' s additional support. &quot; But so far plans focus_on development of the new electricity-generation process , Robert LeChevalier , DOE site manager , said Thursday . &quot; This is a really significant event , &quot; LeChevalier said . &quot; It ' s the first new thermodynamic cycle that ' s been invented since 1895. &quot; The new concept was devised by Alexander Kalina , an engineer from the former Soviet_Union now living_in Northern California . Potentially it could use almost any heat source -- fueled by natural_gas , coal or geothermal or solar_energy -- to produce electricity 20 % more efficiently than current turbine technology . An improvement of this magnitude could mean billions of dollars in energy savings in this country and internationally . The the technology center has the world ' s sole operating model of the device . &quot; We ' ve demonstrated the principles of the cycle , &quot; LeChevalier said , &quot; and a number of large utility suppliers are very interested . . . one is General Electric. &quot; The center also has projects in renewable technologies , energy conservation and earthquake-effects testing . Researchers there can test the effects of seismic events on the parts used to buffer buildings against earthquake , or utility structures such_as pipe systems in power_plants .</TEXT>
