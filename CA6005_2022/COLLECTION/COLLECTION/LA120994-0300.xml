   <HEADLINE> ECONOMISTS SAY LOSS MAY INCLUDE 5 # 000 NEW JOBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The $ 1.5-billion investment loss that drove Orange County into bankruptcy could cost the county several thousand future jobs and slow economic_growth through the end of the decade , economists at Chapman University said Thursday . Although the county will probably not fall_back into recession , the declining value of its investment portfolio could erase 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 of the 21 # 000 new jobs that had earlier been forecast for 1995 , according to projections unveiled at the annual presentation of the Orange County Economic Forecast , compiled by Chapman ' s Center for Economic Research . Through 1999 , the county ' s financial crisis could reduce the number of created jobs by 25 # 000 , said Esmael Adibi , the economist who heads the research unit and performs Chapman ' s long-range forecasting . Most of the job loss would be related to public works projects now on hold , including toll roads , a new Anaheim sports stadium and new public buildings . The total impact of the county ' s bankruptcy filing is harder to predict , the economists said , but a modest ripple effect is virtually assured . That could include a decrease of $ 100 million in annual taxable sales -- about 0.3 % of the total -- and a $ 540-million decline in the gross county product , the measure of all goods and services produced . As a result of the financial crisis , the economists said , the gross county product for 1995 is now projected at $ 81.8 billion , off nearly 1 % from earlier estimates . &quot; It would be a dampening , but not a death blow , &quot; Chapman economist and President James Doti told a crowd of more_than 1 # 000 business and political_leaders . &quot; We are at the height of a financial panic in Orange County right now with fear , anger and confusion making_it difficult to see , &quot; Doti added . &quot; But our analysis shows the county has a strong fundamental economy. &quot; The usually circumspect Doti chastised Robert L . Citron for &quot; a move of desperation &quot; during the summer when the recently resigned county treasurer tried to recoup losses by moving even further into high-risk securities . The then-treasurer , Doti said , was &quot; hoping irrationally to recover &quot; from his disastrous investment strategies &quot; by doing the same thing. &quot; On Tuesday , the county , after revealing huge losses in risky investments by Citron ' s office , became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection . Citron ' s investments went sour because he bet that interest_rates would fall , which would have boosted the value of the bonds he bought . Doti said he could not understand the former treasurer ' s strategy . &quot; By March of this year , &quot; he said , &quot; there were no forecasters predicting that interest_rates would drop. &quot; Ironically , Chapman ' s forecast for 1995 calls_for declining long-term interest_rates . Doti said bonds such_as those on which Citron lost money this year could increase in value by 16 % next year . The Center for Economic Research has been tracking Orange County ' s annual economy since 1981 and is heralded by other forecasters for its high degree of accuracy . The center ' s 1995 forecast prepared a week before the county ' s financial crisis broke had predicted an increase of 21 # 000 jobs on government and private payrolls for the year -- the first overall job growth since 1990 -- and an increase of 105 # 000 jobs by the end of 1999 . If the loss from the investment fund is held to $ 1.5 billion , Doti said , there would be an increase of 17 # 000 jobs in 1995 and 84 # 000 jobs by the end of the decade . &quot; The losses are bad , &quot; Doti said , &quot; but it would be much more devastating to the county ' s economy if there was a tax increase to try to make_up for the losses. &quot; Although the Chapman forecasters see the county on_the_road to recovery , they predicted that a mild national recession will occur in 1996 . But underlying strengths , including healthy foreign trade and high-technology research sectors , as well as a rapidly recovering construction_industry , will &quot; put the county back in its accustomed role &quot; of leading the nation out of recessions , Adibi said . For the last four years , Orange County , along with the rest of California , has had a much weaker economy than much of the United States . On the positive side , the economists said they do not expect the county ' s bankruptcy to depress individual earnings . The median family income is expected to rise 2 % to $ 55 # 507 next year . Nor do they expect the construction_industry ' s long-awaited rebound to stall . Doti said he expects the value of new construction projects , mostly home building , to rise 17 % next year to $ 2.6 billion . Because most of the construction projected is in residential properties , the economists say , that will soften the blow to the industry from decreased spending for public works after the bankruptcy filing . The Chapman forecast does call_for Orange County ' s average home price to fall next year , though . The forecast is for an average decrease of 2.6 % , the fifth consecutive annual decline . But from 1996 through 1999 , Adibi said , homeowners and home_buyers can expect residential property values to increase , topping out with a gain of 7.6 % for 1999 .
