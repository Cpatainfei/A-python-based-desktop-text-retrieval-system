   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; BEIRUT BUILDERS FIND 2 PATHS TO RECOVERY ; A PURGE OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS DIDN ' T END THE USE OF BRIBERY . BUT MORE AGENCIES ARE TAKING A MODERN , ETHICAL APPROACH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the young Lebanese woman arrived to interview for a job in Beirut ' s resurgent business_sector , she was chomping on a wad of gum , wearing makeup that would make Tammy Bakker cringe and insisting that she would consider only executive secretarial positions despite a dearth of experience . Crushed by 15 years of civil_war , the seaside capital has regained its Middle Eastern fire for commerce , but finding qualified personnel is just one of the hurdles facing local and foreign entrepreneurs . There is , as always , the need for grease , the kind represented by crisp paper bills . And developers would give an arm for a working phone . First-rate secretaries may be as rare : One agency reported 50 requests for English-speaking secretaries . Only three suitable candidates were found . Even the 30 foreign companies here under contract with the Lebanese government ' s Council for Development and Reconstruction find roadblocks at every turn . South_Korea ' s Hyundai conglomerate has sent men in to help French and Italian companies repair the country ' s collapsing power_system . The Korean engineers , who came without their families , live_in boarding houses , work 10 hours a day , 6 1 / 2 days a week , and go six months between home leaves . &quot; This way of working makes us cheaper than European firms , &quot; said a business manager with one of the Korean companies . Lebanon ' s estimated $ 4.4-billion reconstruction means good money for all_the foreigners , but the pitfalls are as deep as the postholes they are digging . Like other foreign businesses , the Koreans have found at least two codes of business ethics at_work here , traditional and modern -- or crooked and clean . The traditional method involves the payment of baksheesh -- bribes -- every foot of the way . &quot; These people ( in some government_agencies ) are of the old mentality , they should be replaced by young , young-thinking people , &quot; the Korean manager complained after months of frustration . A purge of corrupt government officials took_place last year . A list of 6 # 000 accused individuals was produced . The disciplinary team was lauded . But then the inevitable happened . Pressure_groups went_into action . Only 600 people were cast_out -- many to be quietly reinstated . The Council for Development and Reconstruction , on the other hand , has a clean bill of ethics . Bids are opened in front of all participating companies and payments are made on_time , the Korean manager said . Set_up in 1977 , the council was revamped by businessman Rafik Hariri after he was appointed prime_minister in 1992 . Last Christmas , Hyundai handed_out promotional pens to council staff . No , the Koreans were told , we cannot accept gifts , just send a card . Even higher ethics ratings go_to Solidere , the private real_estate company the council created to rebuild Beirut ' s city_center . Many of its staff are U.S.-educated -- young , bright and modern . Clean or dirty , any business eventually depends_on communications , one of Lebanon ' s most stubborn business problems . A Lebanese-Canadian businessman said he offered $ 2 # 000 in bribes to get a phone_line . The money should have done the trick , but there weren ' t any lines available . Private companies provide cellular_phones for $ 1 # 500 , five times what a business might pay in the United States . One Lebanese businessman has been paying $ 300 a year to hold a telex line that hasn ' t worked in years , hoping that when things improve the government will offer fax lines to those holding telex lines . Even international politics makes day-to-day commerce a challenge . What will happen when the inevitable peace_treaty with Israel is signed ? Most analysts say that will be a day_of_reckoning for the traditional Lebanese businessman . Trade treaties will follow . Competition from Israel for domestic and regional markets will be stiff . European businesses will join Lebanese expatriates in returning to the commercial scene here . Already working_on government contracts here are firms from Britain , France , Italy , Germany , Belgium , Ireland , Denmark and Poland . At risk will be the Lebanese merchant mentality that says the only good profit is the big and fast profit , said an American businessman who slips_in and out of Beirut despite the U.S. ban on travel_to Lebanon . No Lebanese is happy with anything under a 200 % profit . Only a handful of U.S. businesses have held_on here . Merrill Lynch , American Express and a_few others operate with Lebanese staff . But at the academic level , the U.S. private sector is participating in the reconstruction . Harvard ' s School of Architectural Design has scheduled a course devoted to development plans for a 680 # 000-square-meter landfill in Beirut , the dumping ground for cleared rubble of the old downtown section . Untouched by war are the twin pillars of Lebanon ' s financial system -- bank secrecy and unrestricted transfer of foreign currency . Those foundation_stones may be enough to support the rebound .</TEXT>
