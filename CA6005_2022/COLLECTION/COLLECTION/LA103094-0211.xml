   <HEADLINE> A LITTLE SONG , A LITTLE DANCE ; MATTHEW BRODERICK ' S IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS A BIT OF A BLUR : HE ' S STARRING IN HIS FIRST MUSICAL , DIRECTING HIS FIRST MOVIE , AND HE ' LL SEE TWO MORE FILMS OPEN THIS FALL . DOESN ' T THIS GUY KNOW HOW TO STOP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I don ' t know what I was thinking -- I thought I could whip off a musical in between shooting and editing a film , &quot; Matthew Broderick says with a laugh during a break_in the second week of rehearsals for the La Jolla Playhouse revival of &quot; How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , &quot; which opens today . &quot; It seems like I either have more work than I can handle or none at all , and I ' ve been_on a roll since ' The Night We Never Met. ' &quot; A roll , of course , can be a positive thing or a boulder going downhill , &quot; adds the 32-year-old actor , who also has featured roles in Alan Parker ' s &quot; The Road to Wellville , &quot; which opened Friday , and Alan Rudolph ' s &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle , &quot; out Dec . 21 in Los Angeles . As if that weren ' t enough , Broderick is also making his directorial debut this year with &quot; Infinity &quot; -- a film in which he also stars -- about Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman , based on a script by Broderick ' s mother , Patricia Broderick . &quot; Infinity , &quot; which also stars Patricia Arquette , wrapped in early September , leaving Broderick just enough time to catch a plane to San Diego to begin rehearsals for &quot; How to Succeed. &quot; When the musical closes on Dec . 4 , Broderick will race to Los Angeles to spend six weeks editing &quot; Infinity , &quot; then it ' s off to Washington , where previews for &quot; How to Succeed &quot; begin Jan . 28 . That will be followed by an engagement of the play_on Broadway , where it is to open March 6 . &quot; How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , &quot; a scathing attack on corporate America based on the 1952 best-selling novel by Shepherd Mead , finds Broderick cast as J . Pierrepont Finch , an unctuous young_man who approaches brown-nosing as an art_form . The musical , with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser , opened on Broadway in 1961 and made a star of Robert Morse , who also starred in David Swift ' s 1967 movie of the play . The part demands a lot of Broderick , who is called_upon to sing and dance onstage for the first time as he portrays a character who could easily come_off as repulsive if not given the proper shading . The fact that he has a daunting year of work stretching ahead of him may account in part for Broderick ' s subdued demeanor at today ' s rehearsal . This isn ' t to say that Broderick isn ' t up_to the job ; when director Des McAnuff gives the signal and the cast springs into action , Broderick lights_up like a Christmas_tree . He is , however , clearly a man who knows not to squander his energy , to speak softly , pay_attention and give what is asked of him with as much precision as possible . He is , in short , a team player , and the team he ' s working with here seems quite fond of him . &quot; Matthew is a total delight , and I ' m having a great time with him , &quot; says McAnuff , a director known for his ability to breathe new life into threadbare material . &quot; I felt no trepidation at all about his ability to carry a musical , either , because he has a beautiful singing_voice and he ' s a tremendous actor . The greatest performances in musicals have generally come from actors , not from singers who act , and he ' s done tremendously well so far . &quot; Bobby Morse gave one of the great performances of the time in the original production , but Matthew brings a different style of comedy to the role , &quot; McAnuff continues . &quot; He has a truthful acting style that elevates the play , he ' s mercurial , impish and bold in his comedy choices , and he infuses the play with sophistication and charm . Without a lot of charm , this character would n ' t be interesting . Matthew has charm to burn , but he ' s also a man of substance , which the character he ' s playing definitely is not . . . . An actor needs some distance from his material , and the fact that Matthew is so unlike Finch is part of what makes him great for the part. &quot; A fascination with Finch isn ' t what attracted Broderick to the play . He ' s here , he says , simply because &quot; I ' ve always wanted to do a musical and was attracted to this one because it ' s really funny and it has great songs. &quot; &quot; Bobby Morse got discovered with this play , and people keep saying to me , ' He was such a phenomenon in the part ; aren ' t you afraid to try to follow him ? ' &quot; adds the actor , nibbling at the tuna sandwich that will sustain him through five more hours of vigorous rehearsing . ( One would imagine he ' d be training like an athlete for this grueling role , but he says he ' s just relying_on lots of coffee to get_through the day. ) &quot; My career isn ' t gonna end or be made on this play , because I ' m a known entity . &quot; I ' ve always wanted to sing and took loads of voice lessons before we started because I had a lot of apprehension about it . I tried to do some singing for ' The Lion King ' ( Broderick was the voice of Simba ) , and after three attempts they fired me and got somebody who sounded like me to do the singing . That didn ' t do much for my confidence . Then my singing teacher , Keith Davis , died four days before we started rehearsing. &quot; Though the play is obviously a creative risk for Broderick in many ways , the real risk it presents lies_in the fact that the boyish , bubbly Finch has a lot in common with Ferris Bueller , the title character in the 1986 film &quot; Ferris Bueller ' s Day Off. &quot; &quot; I think I ' ve almost gotten past being typecast as Ferris Bueller , but this play isn ' t going_to help that , because it ' s basically the same role . Nonetheless , if I have to put a gun to their heads , audiences will accept me in adult roles , &quot; he says with a laugh . &quot; Actually , adult roles are the only thing I ' ve done for the past few years -- nobody ' s noticed though , because none of them have been too successful. &quot; True , Broderick has been playing adults of late , but they ' ve all been adults of a certain type . What type might that be ? Nice is a word that comes_to_mind . . . . &quot; I haven ' t consciously avoided playing evil characters or being in violent films , but I tend to not like those scripts when I read them and don ' t like seeing those kinds of films , &quot; he says . &quot; I think I could play evil characters , but the way this business works is , if you ' re successful at something , everybody wants you to keep doing_it again -- you know : ' Let ' s get that Ferris Bueller guy. ' A couple of times I ' ve been sent evil characters , but even then , they ' re usually lovable boyish types who happen to murder women. &quot; Broderick does move_in a slightly darker direction , though , in &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle , &quot; Alan Rudolph ' s revisionist view of writer Dorothy Parker and the other legendary New York wits of the Algonquin Round_Table . Broderick , cast as writer Charles MacArthur , a notorious rake who broke Parker ' s heart , employs his boyish charm here to suggest something dark and manipulative . &quot; Charles isn ' t evil , but he ' s weak ; he ' s a cad basically and is an alcoholic , as everybody in the film is . This should be a winner -- a bunch of suicidal alcoholics , &quot; Broderick says with a laugh . &quot; Anyhow , getting the part was a nice break for me because I don ' t usually get these kinds of roles. &quot; Says Rudolph of his decision to cast Broderick : &quot; I wanted Matthew for the part because he ' s never played a rogue before , but I knew he had it in him . He really delivered too . People who see the film invariably tell me , somewhat surprised , ' Gee , Matthew ' s so sexy. ' &quot; He has it in him to be one of the most rounded acting talents of his generation ; he has the depth and charm of the classic Hollywood legends . He was a huge star before he was 25 years old , and we ' ve just seen the tip of the iceberg of what he ' s capable of. &quot; Broderick ' s character in &quot; The Road to Wellville &quot; -- the film based on the novel of the same name by T . C . Boyle -- is more in keeping with parts he has played before . The fictionalized account of life at the San , a health clinic built_in Battle Creek , Mich. , at the turn_of_the_century by corn_flake magnate John Harvey Kellogg , finds Broderick cast as Will Lightbody , a sexually frustrated husband with a gullible , gorgeous wife played by Bridget Fonda , who leads him around by the nose . &quot; It ' s a reactive role , but it had so_much to react to , &quot; Broderick says of Will Lightbody . &quot; I envisioned the character as a whining 5-year-old who was always throwing tantrums . In fact , I have a picture of myself making a painting when I was 5 years old , and I have paint dripping all_over my legs and look_like a crazy man -- I wanted some of that in this performance. &quot; Parker wanted Broderick not so_much for ability to telegraph craziness but because , he says , &quot; Matthew ' s capable of great subtlety , and you never see the joints in his acting . He brought a gentleness to this part too that was better than how it was written , and I think that ' s a big part of why he ' s a movie_star -- there ' s a gentleness to Matthew that people simply like . I hate to gush , but he really is an extraordinary gentleman and is a delight to work with . He ' s extremely unspoiled considering that he ' s been doing this since he was very young. &quot; Broderick was born in New York City in 1962 , the youngest of three children . He essentially grew_up in the theater : His father , James Broderick , was an actor , and his mother , Patricia ( Biow ) Broderick , a playwright and director . &quot; I had an arty upbringing , &quot; he says . &quot; My mother is_well read , so the conversation in the house was pretty cultured , and I went_to the theater when my father was in it . We went_to museums a lot ; I spent time in Europe , and for a period I considered becoming an artist -- I used to love drawing and still do . &quot; Initially I thought I might want to have some kind of backstage job because the first thing I fell_in_love with was the environment of the theater more_than acting itself . I was a shy kid who didn ' t like being the center_of_attention . Well , actually , part of me loved it . &quot; The first movie that made an impression on me was Charlie Chaplin ' s ' Modern Times. ' I thought it was hilarious and romantic and loved everything about it . I idolized Chaplin and loved the way he moved -- in fact , I used to make paintings of him . I started_out wanting to be a comedic actor , and it never occurred to me to also pursue directing , as Chaplin did . And now , having done_it , I ' d think_twice before attempting it again . Making ' Infinity ' was rough , and I barely got_through it. &quot; After he graduated from high_school in 1980 , Broderick auditioned for Uta Hagen at Herbert Berghof ' s H.B. Studio in New York City . He was accepted , and that year he made his theater debut in an Off-Broadway production of Horton Foote ' s &quot; On Valentine ' s Day , &quot; playing opposite his father . &quot; I was terrified and wasn ' t very good . It was my first play , and I had trouble acting with my father -- I couldn ' t get past the fact that my father was yelling at me in this Southern accent , &quot; he says . Broderick must have been better than he remembers because things happened fast for him after that . In 1981 he was cast in Harvey Fierstein ' s &quot; Torch_Song Trilogy , &quot; and the year after that his career really took_off . &quot; In 1982 I did Neil Simon ' s ' Brighton Beach Memoirs ' on Broadway , and when it was opening , my first movie , ' Max Dugan Returns , ' came_out , &quot; he recalls . &quot; That film wasn ' t too successful , but then ' WarGames , ' which was successful , came_out right when I won the Tony for ' Brighton Beach ' in 1983 . &quot; One would assume I look_back on this as a great time , but this was all happening around the time my father died , so mostly it was a terrible time for me , &quot; he says softly . &quot; I was very close to my father , and I found_out he was dying the night of the first preview of ' Torch_Song Trilogy. ' Then when I was shooting ' WarGames ' and ' Max Dugan Returns ' in L.A. , I was flying back weekends to be with him . I guess I dealt with his death by staying busy , but I don ' t know . . . . Would it have been_better not to work and to have been home all_the time ? I hoped he ' d like seeing that his son was going_to make a living , and he was very excited about ' Brighton. ' This sounds like a movie , but he managed to live until I had the first_reading of the play and called him from L.A. and told him it had gone well . He died the next night ( Nov . 1 , 1982 ) . &quot; I don ' t know how it changed me , losing him . I ' ve thought_about that a lot , and I think it made me shut_down for a long_time . A big part of my life was just not dealt with because I couldn ' t deal with it , and it took a_couple_of years for me to even admit what had happened and get upset about it . It ' s funny what time does , though . It ' s been 12 years since my father died , and you kind of get_over it even without knowing you are . It just sort of fades_away , which is sad. &quot; Broderick completed 10 films in the next eight years , all_of which were successful enough to keep him in the game . His stock went_up considerably in 1986 with the release of &quot; Ferris Bueller ' s Day Off , &quot; and he got the co-star of his life in 1990 when he was cast opposite Marlon Brando in the Andrew Bergman comedy &quot; The Freshman. &quot; &quot; When I met Marlon Brando , I was pretty shaken_up for a while , but I got_over that and just grew to adore him . He was great , &quot; says Broderick , who turned_in what many consider the best performance of his career in that film . Broderick made &quot; The Freshman &quot; after a serious automobile accident in Ireland in 1987 . He suffered a severely broken leg and other injuries when the car he was driving collided_with another , killing its two occupants . Broderick was charged with manslaughter and reckless driving but was cleared of both . &quot; I feel more like an adult now , &quot; he says , reflecting on how the accident affected him . &quot; Obviously , it was extremely difficult coming_to grips with what happened , but in time I felt better about that terrible experience . I went_to a therapist , and he helped . Unfortunately , my therapist died of cancer about a year after the accident . &quot; I ' ve experienced a lot of death , &quot; he adds , &quot; but experiencing it doesn ' t make you any more comfortable with it . I wish I had some holy , accepting attitude about it , but I don ' t -- I just wish it didn ' t happen . Yes , you get_over it and move_on , but you ' re not the same and they ' re not there . They ' re really not there. &quot; O ne would assume that trau matic experiences of this sort are made doubly difficult by being in_the_public_eye , however , Broderick appears to have made_peace with the vagaries of life as a public figure . &quot; Fame has a life of its own that has little to do with the person himself : We ' re like fictional_characters that get_into peoples ' consciousness , and I don ' t see that as good or bad . that ' s just the way it is . &quot; People have been staring at me when I ' m in public for about 10 years and I ' ve learned to tune it out , but I have no idea how it ' s affected my personality . At first it was exciting , then for a while it pissed me off and I was nasty to people , and now I ' m a blank -- I ' m polite but I don ' t connect to anybody . It ' s ironic , because when people approach me , they usually want to tell me they like my work , and that ' s exactly what you want . But something inside shuts down that prevents you from being engaged by those encounters . &quot; It ' s an occupational hazard that once you become famous you become cut_off from normal life . I see films sometimes where two movie_stars are in the supermarket shopping , and I think to myself , ' Wow , she probably hasn ' t been in a supermarket in years. ' &quot; People who don ' t know me often assume I have a swollen head , and I find myself endlessly trying to prove I ' m normal . The most widely held misconception about famous actors is that they ' re all_in love with themselves -- lots of actors are extremely self-conscious . My girlfriend ( actress Sarah Jessica Parker ) goes_to the gym and comes_home moaning that she ' s out of shape , and she has a beautiful body. &quot; Speaking of Parker , how come she keeps talking to the media about her struggle to get the actor to marry her ? &quot; I love it when she does that , &quot; he says wryly . &quot; I don ' t know why she does that -- want to call her ? It ' s become a shtick almost . My love life is fine , but I ' m not gonna blab about it . I ' ll leave that to Sarah. &quot; In parting , one asks Broderick what he feels is the most rewarding part of all_the work with which he is currently deluged . What ' s the payoff ? &quot; There ' s a rush from being the new guy , which is what happened for me in ' 82 with ' Brighton Beach , ' &quot; he replies after a long , thoughtful pause . &quot; I loved the part ; I felt fully used and could sense myself flying into something . I ' d get huge laughs and big applause -- I just felt great . But after you ' ve done this work for a while , you have to find your fun in a different place because you ' re no longer anybody ' s ' discovery ' and you ' re probably gonna get your fair share of negative criticism . &quot; You have to love the work itself , and I do -- it ' s my life really , &quot; he says . &quot; I can remember the first play I did when I was 15 . Nervous as I was onstage , I could feel I belonged there . This isn ' t to say I ' m the best actor in the world , but I do know that I ' m an actor. &quot;</TEXT>
