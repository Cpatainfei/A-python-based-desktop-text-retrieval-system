   <HEADLINE> CHECKPOINT BACK IN BUSINESS ; MORE THAN 150 INTERCEPTED ; IMMIGRATION : BORDER_PATROL POST HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR SIX WEEKS BUT WILL REMAIN OPEN AT LEAST UNTIL FEBRUARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Border_Patrol officials said Monday that they intercepted more_than 150 people trying to enter the country illegally at the San Clemente checkpoint , which reopened Sunday after being closed for six weeks . &quot; It ' s average , &quot; said Ted Swofford , assistant Border_Patrol agent. &quot; We were productive , and it ' s good to get_back into operation. &quot; Caltrans officials estimate that 110 # 000 vehicles a day pass_through the four-lane checkpoint , Swofford said . Despite heavy weekend traffic that caused minor delays Sunday , officials say they do not expect daily traffic to be delayed more_than 15 minutes . &quot; It ' s not a problem at all , &quot; Swofford said . &quot; Not any more so than it was two months ago. &quot; Within a_few hours of its reopening , Border_Patrol agents also stopped a vehicle carrying 654 pounds of marijuana and arrested two men . All 93 San Clemente Border_Patrol agents have returned from the Imperial Beach station by the border to the checkpoint along Interstate 5 , Swofford said . To take their place at the border are more_than 80 new Border_Patrol agents . Another 150 agents are also on their way there , Swofford said . The station will operate until February , when it will close for two weeks before reopening again . At that time , Immigration and Naturalization Service officials are expected to decide whether the checkpoint is effective enough to be kept_open , Swofford said . &quot; I personally think we ' re better at the ( San Clemente ) checkpoint , &quot; he said . &quot; A defensive squad on a football_team does not put all their people on one line . We need the secondary line of defense. &quot;</TEXT>
