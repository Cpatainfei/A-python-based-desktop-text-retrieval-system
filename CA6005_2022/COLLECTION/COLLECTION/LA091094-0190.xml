   <HEADLINE> AS SHORT CALLS PROLIFERATE , PHONE FIRMS SEEK NEW FEES ; TECHNOLOGY : INNOVATIONS LIKE E-MAIL MEAN LESS TIME ON THE LINES . WHETHER THAT RAISES COSTS IS DISPUTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprising side_effect of new technologies , Americans ' telephone_calls are suddenly getting much shorter -- and if the phone_companies have their way , those short calls will soon get much more expensive . Despite the nation ' s long love_affair with leisurely phone chats , innovations such_as pagers , voice mail , E-mail , electronic credit_card readers and fax machines are now dramatically abbreviating telephone_calls and luring longer connections off the public phone network . Today , as people leave voice mail rather than calling_back -- or send E-mail rather than calling_at all -- about 52 % of residential phone conversations last one minute or less , compared with 22 % in 1982 . Telephone_companies are not at all happy about this . They say it is costing them money -- not because overall phone traffic is down ( it isn ' t ) , but because the first few seconds of a call , when the initial connection is made , are the most expensive to handle . Not surprisingly , they have a solution : a new &quot; setup &quot; charge that could make some short calls as much as five times more expensive . Next week , the California Public_Utilities Commission is expected to approve a request by Pacific Bell to levy such a charge for long-distance_calls made within California . Pac Bell has proposed a similar fee for interstate calls_in a petition recently filed with the Federal Communications Commission . Eventually , the new fee could be extended_to local_calls as well , satisfying a longstanding phone_company desire to move away from flat-rate monthly charges and require customers to pay_for each call . But such changes are likely to anger consumers , and could thwart the development of computer on-line services and other emerging communications technologies . Phone_company finances aside , it is clear that new technologies are drastically altering the way the public telephone network is used . In Massachusetts , physicians whose staffs once spent hours placing long-distance and local_calls to determine patients ' insurance eligibility now accomplish the same task in seconds by swiping a wallet-size ID card though an electronic scanner connected by phone_lines to Blue Cross / Blue Shield . In New York , Howard Sogren , senior_vice_president of global systems and technology at Merrill Lynch , says he hardly ever picks_up his phone now that he can send electronic messages over his company ' s private computer_network . &quot; In the last year I have reduced my need to have a phone conversation with anyone overseas by 90 % and domestically , by about 60 % , &quot; he says . Around the country , retailers are verifying credit_cards electronically in seconds , rather than spending minutes on the phone . Companies of all stripes are finding they can make_do with fewer personnel to field live phone_calls : Operators and secretaries are being eliminated as electronic voice mail boxes are installed . And marketing is being transformed by computers that tirelessly dial homes to pitch products with a synthesized human voice that does not dally with customers . &quot; E-mail and voice mail reduce significantly the time &quot; spent on the phone , said Dan Elron , a telecommunications expert at the New York offices of Coopers &amp; Lybrand . The technology , Elron added , forces people to dispense_with &quot; extraneous issues like the weather and deal with things much faster. &quot; The social implications of these changes are ambiguous . And it is impossible to determine whether live conversations are actually any shorter than they used to be . Data about phone usage shows only whether a call has been completed , not what kind of traffic the call is carrying . For the phone_companies , none of this matters . What they see is a proliferation of costly , short calls . And they say current pricing encourages many of the users who make longer calls -- big companies and government_agencies that maintain lengthy connections with clients or satellite offices -- to abandon the public phone network in favor of cheaper private_lines . &quot; The problem with the current rate structure is you lose the winners and keep the losers , &quot; said Ed Lowry , executive_director of external affairs for Bell Atlantic Corp . &quot; We have to be able to give our customers pricing options to keep them and get our rates more in_line with costs. &quot; &quot; The phone_companies face a material loss of revenue unless they address the situation of the continuing proliferation of short-duration calls , &quot; said Richard P . Nespola , president of Management Network Group Inc. , a Leawood , Kans. , consulting firm . &quot; The market has changed . Communications are coming_in short bursts. &quot; Pacific Bell contends that the new charge it is seeking would not affect consumers because it would be collected from long-distance carriers . But the long-distance companies , which already pay an &quot; access charge &quot; to local phone firms to cover the local portion of all calls , are likely to pass any higher costs along to consumers , experts say . And some dispute the phone_company argument that short calls are more expensive to carry . &quot; This is telecom tomfoolery , &quot; said Bruce Kushnick , president of New Networks Institute , a New York research firm . &quot; Moving electrons over a wire does not cost more money . The telephone_companies are simply restating their math &quot; in_order to win rate increases . Computer on-line services and other heavy users of the public network are fiercely opposed to the new pricing proposals . &quot; This obviously would have a deleterious impact on the nation ' s economy and essentially would penalize CompuServe and similarly situated companies for making extremely efficient use of the public switched network , &quot; said CompuServe , one of the nation ' s leading computer on-line services , in a petition filed with the FCC last month . Instead of pressing for such rate increases , CompuServe said , phone_companies &quot; should concentrate_on finding less costly ways of setting_up calls. &quot; Indeed , some find it peculiar that phone_companies would be complaining about changing usage patterns , since new technologies in_general are contributing to an unprecedented boom in communications , which in turn is creating major new opportunities for phone_companies . &quot; Even though we ' ve seen the development of value-added private networks that take telephone users off the public switched network , we tend to see growth in other areas that didn ' t exist before , &quot; said Bob Baulch , a manager of AT &amp; T ' s communications service group in Morristown , N.J. &quot; There is all kinds of private networking going_on and to us that ' s an accepted practice that does not ( alarm us ) . &quot; Overall demand for phones is exploding so_much , in fact , that some area_codes could be filled to capacity in the next few years . What ' s more , some phone innovations , such_as voice mail and call waiting , allow millions of calls to be completed today that in the past might have gone unanswered or uncompleted . But many of the additional lines being hooked up are devoted to fax machines , on-line computer services or other devices that communicate in relatively brief periods . Other added capacity does not directly financially benefit the local phone_companies . For an industry seeking new revenue streams to modernize its networks , experts say the trend is ominous .</TEXT>
