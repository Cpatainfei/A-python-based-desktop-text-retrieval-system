   <HEADLINE> JUSTICES CLEAR UP BANKRUPTCY LAW PROPERTY DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A property ' s sale price at foreclosure , not its market_value , determines its worth in bankruptcy proceedings , the Supreme Court ruled Monday . The 5-4 decision resolves a longstanding dispute in bankruptcy law , and it upholds the existing practice in California.Lawyers for the state ' s lenders and title insurers applauded the result and said it removes a cloud that could have hung over many recent property sales .

Relying_on those words , federal_courts in some regions , including the U.S. appeals court in Texas , have voided foreclosure sales that yielded a price far below the accepted market_value for the property . This approach , if adopted by the high_court , would have called into question any past foreclosure sales where the price fell well below market_value . But writing for the court , Justice Antonin Scalia rejected this &quot; radical departure &quot; from &quot; over 400 years . . . of Anglo American jurisprudence. &quot; A foreclosure sale , so_long as it is announced and follows lawful rules , establishes the accepted price for the property , even if the amount is below the earlier established market_price , he said .</TEXT>
