   <HEADLINE> GRIEF REMAINS WHEN ONE PARENT WHISKS YOUNGSTERS OUT OF U.S. ; CUSTODY : OFTEN THE CHILDREN ARE SNATCHED DURING A BITTER DIVORCE . THE ABDUCTORS USUALLY HAVE STRONG TIES IN THE OTHER COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lilly Waken ' s husband and two young daughters left home for a party and never came_back . Frantically she called police , she called hospitals -- then she learned her Arab husband had bought three one-way tickets to Damascus , Syria . That was 18 months ago , and Waken hasn ' t seen her children since . Her husband returned to Miami once -- without the children -- for a divorce hearing . A judge awarded Waken custody of their two girls , but her husband , Mohammed , ignored the court_order and slipped out of the country . Lamia has since turned 3 ; Dalal is 6 . Waken wonders where they are , and whether they remember her . &quot; My heart is stolen , my soul is gone , &quot; she said from her Miami home , where she keeps the girls ' room ready for them . &quot; Unless your children were taken , no one can know the pain I live with. &quot; There are others who know . U.S. parents are seeking to bring_home more_than 1 # 000 children taken from this country by a mother or father , according to State_Department records . And children ' s advocates believe many_more cases go unreported . Often the children are snatched during a divorce . The abducting parents usually have strong ties_in the other country . But sometimes an American-born mother or father will take_off for an unfamiliar nation to flee U.S. law . Left-behind parents suddenly find a maze of foreign laws and customs standing between them and their children . Finding a missing child within the United States is daunting . But finding a missing child abroad often seems hopeless -- especially for those like Waken who cannot afford specialized attorneys , private_detectives and international travel . &quot; Most of the mothers live a kind of quiet agony if they don ' t have the money , &quot; said Shayna Gluck Lazarevich , who has searched Serbia for her two children for 4 1 / 2 years . Even those with money to spend often find it ' s not enough . After Lazarevich ' s ex-husband kidnaped their two children from her home_in Santa Cruz , Calif. , a bank seized his $ 70 # 000 account and turned it over to her . The money paid 10 lawyers , and helped Lazarevich take her custody_case all_the way to Serbia ' s highest_court -- winning at each step . It helped her travel_to Serbia to search for the children . It took her to Washington to seek help . Former Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III championed her cause , and 90 members of Congress signed a petition for the return of her children . She met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic . But 11-year-old Sasha and 8-year-old Andre are still missing . Serbian officials have been unable or unwilling to find the children and turn them over to her . The civil_war in Bosnia only makes things worse . And her money has run_out . &quot; I ' ve done everything right and still I don ' t have my children , &quot; Lazarevich , 32 , said during one of many visits to Washington . &quot; People don ' t sense the agony , the anguish , the desperation that parents feel , &quot; she said . &quot; That must be understood before we will get any real help. &quot; Parents searching for their children in other countries get only limited help from the U.S._government . A State_Department brochure warns them , &quot; You must direct the search and recovery operation yourself. &quot; The department does offer some basic help in finding children . &quot; We will attempt as best we can to locate the child and visit them and report on their health , &quot; said State_Department spokeswoman Nyda Budig . The department will ask another nation to check travel and school records for a missing child ' s name , for example . But some nations don ' t keep complete records . And some missing children live under false_names . And , Budig points_out , some parents don ' t even know which nation their children are living_in . Many parents complain that consular officials don ' t do enough to help them . Maria Rojas of Centreville , Va. , is organizing a march in Washington this summer to demand more help for parents searching for internationally abducted children . &quot; My children are U.S. citizens , but the people at the State_Department don ' t want to be bothered with them , &quot; she said . &quot; They just don ' t care. &quot; Finding a missing child is only the start . A parent must then take his or her case to the foreign country ' s legal_system . Most nations do not recognize custody orders from U.S. courts . Even when criminal charges have been filed against the abducting parent in America , many nations will not honor a U.S. request for extradition . And some nations may discriminate against women or Americans . The State_Department will give a parent information about a foreign legal_system , but cannot intercede in court on the parent ' s behalf , Budig said . &quot; Most children who are taken abroad are not returned , &quot; said Betty Mahmoody , an American who escaped with her daughter from an abusive husband in Iran . She formed an organization to help parents of children kidnaped abroad , called One World : For Children . Mahmoody said the group has helped parents of 900 children taken_to &quot; difficult &quot; countries ; only 49 were returned . &quot; Most of the time , it ' s an impossible situation , &quot; she said . The State_Department has logged 5 # 500 cases of international child abduction by parents since it began keeping records in 1978 . The number rises each year . Eighty percent of the cases are now considered inactive . But it ' s unclear how many of the children have come_home . Some cases were dropped from the files when the State_Department didn ' t hear from the left-behind parent for two years ; others were closed when the missing child turned 18 . Officials are sifting through the files to compile statistics , Budig said . Although it ' s difficult to document , the State_Department says the odds of bringing a kidnaped child home from abroad are improving . In December , President Clinton signed a law making_it a federal felony to kidnap a child to another country . But it ' s too early to assess the impact that will have , said Howard Davidson , director of the American Bar Assn . &quot; It ' s very easy to pass a law to say certain things will become federal crimes without providing the resources to investigators and U.S. attorneys and federal_courts to fulfill the intent of the law , &quot; he said . Mahmoody said , &quot; Every deterrent we have is helpful. &quot; Perhaps the biggest advance came_in 1988 , when the United States signed a treaty with 30 other nations , agreeing to return kidnaped children to their home countries . Courts in the home country then will resolve any remaining custody disputes . The Hague treaty has been proven successful in returning children to the United States from the mostly Western nations that have ratified it . But almost half of the 806 abductions reported to the State_Department in 1993 were not covered by the Hague treaty . The Middle Eastern countries of Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Saudi_Arabia and Syria -- among the nations least cooperative in returning children to the United States -- have not signed . &quot; The State_Department isn ' t doing a whole heck of a lot to give the parents in non-Hague countries any hope , &quot; said Frederick Rooney , a Bethlehem , Pa. , attorney who does pro bono work for women whose children are in the Middle_East . There is another treaty in which nations agree to work together on children ' s issues , including international kidnaping . It is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , adopted in 1989 . The treaty has been signed or ratified by 170 nations , including some Mideast countries such_as Syria and Iran . But the United States has yet to sign it , so it ' s of no help to U.S. parents . President Clinton has ordered a review of the treaty , to be completed this spring . Meanwhile , the American Bar Assn . has been educating judges and attorneys about the risk of child abduction during divorce cases . Often parents ' fears are dismissed , Davidson said . Lazarevich , for example , told the court that her former husband , Dragisa , had threatened to take their children to Yugoslavia . But the judge granted him unsupervised visits anyway . During one of those weekend visits , he abducted the children . Children ' s advocates say stricter controls on passports and children ' s travel would make_it tougher to sneak a child out of the United States . Waken suspects her girls are now living with their paternal grandparents in Saudi_Arabia . &quot; I would do anything to get them back , &quot; said Waken , 32 . She pulled_out a photograph of her daughters as she last saw them -- the curly-haired baby and smiling older sister -- and described the Christmas_presents she keeps wrapped and ready for their return . She was reluctant to put the photograph back in her purse , pausing to kiss each face . &quot; I just want to hear my daughters ' voices at least , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want them to forget me. &quot;</TEXT>
