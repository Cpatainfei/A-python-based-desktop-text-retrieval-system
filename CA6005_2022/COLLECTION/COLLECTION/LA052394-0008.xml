   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TESTIMONY ; ONE PERSON ' S STORY ABOUT TEACHING ; ' EVERY STUDENT HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dilip Saxena was born in Washington , D.C. , where his father , a diplomat from India , was stationed . The family soon returned to India where Saxena received a Master ' s degree in Literature . He later returned to the United States and has taught sixth grade in Riverside County ' s Corona-Norco Unified School District for the past eight years . This year he received the Bravo award from the L.A. Music Center for incorporating the fine_arts and performing arts into his curriculum . I believe that every student has something to offer and that the arts are a really good avenue to discover that something . Once we find it , they can develop self-confidence and project it into other areas . There are so many different types of students . I have one student who knows no English and yet can participate in our drama productions . I have another from Japan who is newly arrived . Students who come from broken homes or have a nasty atmosphere at_home are able to get_away from that and express themselves through art rather than be bottled_up and expected to memorize all_of this information that doesn ' t really mean very much to them . Art helps them get_in_touch with themselves . A lot of times after having done a performance , even participating in a tiny little part , they will come and open_up to you about various things they normally would n ' t do . They come_to realize that they can communicate to everybody there and to me and they end_up feeling a little closer to me . Our district is very innovative and encourages things like that . Not only does the administration let us do what we want , but they support us financially and there ' s a lot of involvement of the PTA in our school and the community . Every time we put_on one of these productions we invite the neighboring schools . So it becomes a pretty big thing and doesn ' t get limited to something that you ' re doing just in your classroom . Everybody realizes the variety of information that ' s being conveyed to the students . For example , when we do plays , one of the most important things is doing light and sound . Instead of just opening a book and asking what are the theories behind light and sound they actually learn how sound travels . They know why they are learning -- it ' s not just because it ' s in the book but because they actually can use this information . The emphasis is_on what you can do with your education rather then learn it and get an A and that ' s it . Grading is not a problem . Cooperative learning is pretty big in our district . The kids do presentations and we have an oral language grade in our report_card and that is pretty important . They use the information they have and do a presentation in front of the whole class . They have to focus_on an assigned area -- say the plant_life in the rain_forest . They do overhead slides , and draw diagrams on the board labeling everything . I have told them I will be checking on how much information they have gathered on , for example , photosynthesis . Every single student has something to offer . As a teacher its my job to find_out what that thing is and to pull it out . One of our lessons had to do with ancient Egypt . So I had one group working_on Pharaoh ' s court , another on how they would do things in the market place , another on what they believe about afterlife and a fourth group was working_on gods and goddesses in ancient Egypt . The first_step is for them to get_together as a group and isolate information they find interesting . The second step was to get them to go_to the library and get Egyptian music . Once they get the information they use mime to the music and the rest of the class has to figure_out what they are trying to convey . So they get_on the tables while everybody else is watching them they act_out , without any words , information they are trying to convey . While they are doing that the rest of the group is trying to write words for the mime . They are learning social studies but through spatial movements . They end_up writing a script for a play . This year we have talked_about most of the Impressionist paintings and the kids not only try to interpret that art but also learn about the artists . It is interesting for them because they learn that many of the artists , when they were kids , had similar experiences to what a lot of these kids are going_through . In another instance they were reading John Lennon and he recalled his days sitting in the classroom wondering &quot; when will these people realize what I have to offer -- I have so_much to offer but nobody seems to thinks I ' m any good. &quot; So we listen to Lennon ' s music and then you tell the students this is how he felt how many of you have felt that way and they connect with it . We see the students excelling and then come_back after junior_high and it has worked for them . Ninety percent of what they watch on television_news and elsewhere is so negative . We have to teach them to look_for the positives in themselves .</TEXT>
