   <TEXT> A Glendale man faces trial on attempted murder and child_abuse charges , even though the prosecutor was unsuccessful in coaxing testimony from a 4-year-old girl -- the only other person who witnessed an alleged June 12 beating that left her twin brother severely brain-damaged . Fateheen Rahman , 22 , who told police the boy hurt himself in a fall against a marble coffee_table , will be arraigned later this month in Van Nuys Superior_Court . After a preliminary hearing this week , Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers ordered him to stand trial on attempted murder and child endangerment charges . So small that most courtroom observers could see only her blond curls as she climbed onto the witness_stand , Jessica Thivener sang into the microphone , asked_for her mother and said , &quot; I want to see Jason. &quot; She looked_at pictures of twin brother Jason , who a doctor testified is &quot; in a vegetative state &quot; -- perhaps permanently -- from his injuries . She occasionally glanced at Rahman . But she seemed afraid . She would n ' t tell Deputy Dist . Atty . Lea Purwin D ' Agostino what she , and she alone , had seen , despite the prosecutor ' s gentle questions . &quot; Jason ' s sleeping , &quot; Jessica said before trying to run from the witness_stand on Wednesday . &quot; Is Jason hurt ? &quot; D ' Agostino prodded , and the child replied , &quot; Yes. &quot; But when asked how Jason had been hurt , Jessica said , &quot; I don ' t want to tell. &quot; The child ' s age and reluctance left Silvers little choice but to exclude her testimony . Later , away from the courtroom and safe in the arms of her mother , Jessica again was asked what happened to Jason . &quot; Fateheen , &quot; she said , grabbing a toy clown by the neck and hurling it forcefully to the floor . Silvers ordered Rahman , a native of Bangladesh , held_on $ 500 # 000 bail . She also ordered him not to call or write the twins ' mother , Tammi Thivener , 25 , of Van Nuys . Outside the courtroom , Thivener said she blames herself for leaving her children with Rahman when she suddenly was called_in to work_at a department_store where she had just gotten a job . She had planned to marry him , she said , but &quot; I don ' t have any feelings for him right now . I can ' t believe that someone so loving , so nice , could do something so horrible. &quot; Paramedic Dennis Archie testified that Rahman told him that the children had been playing and that Jason stopped breathing when Jessica sat on him . Archie also testified that he saw Rahman &quot; strike the baby with his fists , harder than you or I would. &quot; Detective Irene Frizzell of the Los Angeles Police_Department testified that Jessica had earlier told her that Rahman had choked them . The child first demonstrated by putting her hands around the detective ' s neck , Frizzell testified . Later , she grabbed a Barbie doll by the neck and threw it to the floor , Frizzell said . * Frizzell recounted that when she interviewed Rahman in the Van Nuys Jail the day after Jason was injured , he &quot; was crying and distraught. &quot; He told her that he was tired and was trying to sleep on the couch , but the children were crying . He said he spanked them , and that made them cry more . The detective said he told her that he shook Jason , who broke free and accidentally banged his head on the coffee_table . Because of his brain injury , Jason will probably spend the rest of his life &quot; in a vegetative state , &quot; and his prognosis for recovery is grim , testified Antonio Galvis , a pediatrician at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles . The 4-year-old underwent surgery for the second time Tuesday , so doctors could install a permanent shunt to drain from his skull the fluid that gathers there because of his injuries . Galvis , on_duty at the hospital when Jason arrived by helicopter June 12 , said the boy ' s brain was swelling so quickly his life was in danger . Jason was bruised on the left side of his head , neck , face and ear . Tiny blood_vessels in his face had ruptured , indicating he had been choked , Galvis said . Questioned by defense_attorney Richard S . Plotin , Galvis said he doubted Jason received his injuries by falling against a coffee_table . He said the boy ' s injuries were the type he usually sees &quot; only in the ones who fall from buildings or are in automobile accidents. &quot; Outside of court , Thivener said she holds her son for hours at the hospital . It ' s the only thing that seems to calm his whimpering . &quot; He ' s lying there , his eyes are open , and he ' s crying , &quot; said Thivener . &quot; I know he ' s in pain , that he feels everything , every poke , &quot; she said . &quot; He needs a miracle . They said he ' d die . For him to still be alive is a miracle. &quot; Plotin said outside court that Rahman felt so remorseful that Jason was injured under his care that he wrote Jason a letter . &quot; He expressed his remorse and said he was sorry . He said he loved Jason and hopes he gets better , &quot; the lawyer said . &quot; He feels devastated and ashamed , &quot; Plotin said . &quot; He never intended any injury . This is a tragedy for everybody concerned. &quot; Said Thivener : &quot; Maybe he didn ' t mean to do_it , but he still did it. &quot;</TEXT>
