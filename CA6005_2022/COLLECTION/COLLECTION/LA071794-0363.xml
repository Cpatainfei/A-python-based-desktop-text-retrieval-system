   <HEADLINE> FLEEING RWANDAN TROOPS SHOOT AND LOOT ; AFRICA : SOME UNITS ESCAPE INTO ZAIRE BEHIND CIVILIANS . REBELS AIR AN APPEAL FOR SURRENDER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Edgy Rwandan government troops , intoxicated on beer and marijuana , systematically looted this onetime resort town on the border with Zaire on Saturday and randomly fired revolvers and automatic weapons to discourage any effort to stop them . On Saturday morning , a French colonel commanding two_dozen troops sent_in from nearby Goma to evacuate 168 Hutu orphans told his men , &quot; Watch_out , because the Rwandan soldiers are hashed to the eyeballs. &quot; As the troops gutted government_offices , stores and private homes , cargo aircraft roared overhead , bringing_in the first emergency relief supplies for the hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees who have crossed into Zaire for fear of reprisal by predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels . The rebels have taken_over most of the country since Hutu majority extremists began massacring Tutsis and moderate Hutus after an unexplained plane crash killed Rwanda ' s Hutu president April 6 . Up to half a_million Rwandans have died in the upheaval , according to U.N. estimates , and even more have fled the country . Some officials in Goma , Gisenyi ' s sister city across the Zaire border , estimated that more_than 500 # 000 refugees have crossed over since Thursday , while others have given lower figures . Long after nightfall , the sound of automatic arms and explosions here was audible miles away in Goma . And still later , some government troops retreated with their weapons over the border into Zaire as rebel forces said they had reached the outskirts of Gisenyi , Reuters news service reported . Reporters close to the border saw at least 20 trucks loaded with Rwandan troops and four anti-aircraft guns drive through Goma , the agency added . Reuters also reported that the Tutsi-led front , in a radio_broadcast , called_on government troops to surrender . &quot; We call_upon all those soldiers . . . and citizens who have fled to Gisenyi or other areas , to give themselves up_to the RPF forces and return to their homes , instead of continuing to listen to those who have cheated them and have launched a war which they cannot fight , &quot; said rebel Radio Rwanda , monitored by the_British Broadcasting Corp . Maj . Gen . Augustin Bizimungu , the Rwandan army ' s chief_of_staff , summed_up the situation as &quot; catastrophic &quot; as he emerged from a meeting at Goma ' s airport with Maj . Gen . Romeo Dallaire , commander of the U.N. force trying to end more_than three months of fighting . Although the International Committee of the Red_Cross estimated that 800 # 000 Hutus would cross into Zaire , disaster relief specialists began to express cautious optimism about Africa ' s worst refugee crisis . Lionel A . Rosenblatt , president of Washington-based Refugees International , said , &quot; I think we can still avert a disaster , despite a slower start than we would have liked. &quot; Two flights carrying a total of 60 tons of corn arrived in Goma from neighboring Uganda , the first contribution from the United Nations ' refugee relief agency . &quot; We are doing our best to cope_with a lack of adequate preparedness , &quot; agency spokesman Panos Moumtzis told reporters . He acknowledged the shipments represented &quot; just a drop_in the ocean , &quot; but said air deliveries by Monday should amount to 240 tons a day , with the bulk of the 600 tons needed daily coming_by road . The Red_Cross flew in 34 tons of plastic sheeting for shelters but expressed concern about fighting among refugees for equitable distribution .</TEXT>
