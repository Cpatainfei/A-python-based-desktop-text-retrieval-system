   <HEADLINE> CHURCH PLANS ORPHANAGE IN RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A church group is setting_up one of the first American-sponsored orphanages in Rwanda since tribal violence there left tens of thousands of children without parents or separated from relatives they may never see again . Safe_Harbor Ministries , with the Calvary Chapel of Rancho Santa Margarita , hopes to open the tent city to accommodate about 3 # 000 children near the end of September , said Bob Krantz , acting director . It would eventually work with world relief organizations to get the children adopted . &quot; These children , many of whom are under 5 , . . . have been left to fend_for themselves , &quot; Krantz said . &quot; We want to take them in and give them some relative stability. &quot; Krantz said he believes this would be the first American-organized orphanage for Rwandan children . &quot; Other organizations have brought_in food , water and medical supplies , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re pleased that we have the chance to do something more. &quot; A three-member Safe_Harbor delegation traveled_to the Rwanda-Uganda border this month . It met with an African Presbyterian mission that had indicated it would allow Safe_Harbor to set_up a makeshift orphanage on a parcel_of_land belonging_to the mission . Krantz said the deal has been made final , and volunteers from medical_institutions will go there late next month to set_up medical , food and living tents for children . Safe_Harbor is accepting donations from hundreds of churches and social_groups nationwide and from organizations like World Relief , World Vision and Food for the Hungry to raise $ 240 # 000 to set_up the orphanage , Krantz said . There are between 100 # 000 and 180 # 000 unaccompanied and traumatized children in refugee camps along the Rwandan borders with neighboring countries . A truck sent by the United Nations Children ' s Fund , or UNICEF , travels daily across eastern Zaire , collecting the abandoned children . Early in the month , some 7 # 400 unaccompanied children had been collected in Munigi by relief workers . The Safe_Harbor delegation dispensed medical supplies and baby products . Each day the camps and African-run orphanages exceed their capacity , and each day more children are brought_in or wander in to the camps .</TEXT>
