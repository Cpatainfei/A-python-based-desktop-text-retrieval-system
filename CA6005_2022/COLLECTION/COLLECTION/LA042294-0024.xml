   <TEXT> ' seaQuest ' Renewed : Capping a banner year for Steven Spielberg , NBC on Thursday renewed its Sunday night underwater adventure series , &quot; seaQuest DSV , &quot; co-produced by Spielberg ' s Amblin Television , for next season . The series , which goes head-to-head with the indomitable &quot; Murder , She Wrote &quot; at 8 p.m. , ranks only 83rd in the year-to-date national Nielsens . But NBC on Thursday called the show a &quot; self-starter , &quot; noting it has done_well with young-adult viewers and was one of three new drama series nominated this year for a &quot; People ' s Choice Award. &quot; * No Boost for ' Tom ' : If the marital rift between Roseanne and Tom Arnold is a publicity stunt , as some suspect , it does not seem to be prompting added interest in Tom Arnold ' s struggling CBS series , &quot; Tom. &quot; The show came_in last again in its 8:30 p.m. Wednesday time_slot , and drew almost identical ratings to the previous week ' s episode . &quot; Tom &quot; last week drew 10 % of the available audience , as it did Wednesday . Roseanne Arnold on Monday filed for divorce , alleging emotional and physical abuse .

THE ARTS Arts Funding Update : Mayor Richard Riordan ' s $ 4.3-billion municipal budget , presented Wednesday to the City_Council , includes no significant new reductions in allocations for the city ' s Cultural Affairs Department , according to a department spokeswoman .

Meanwhile , at the state level , members of a Senate subcommittee have recommended elimination of the California Arts Council budget , which has been targeted for elimination in the past but has so far retained its funding .
