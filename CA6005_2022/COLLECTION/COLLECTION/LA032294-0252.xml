   <HEADLINE> CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS ; SPRINGSTEEN CLOSES ROCK_MUSIC GAP ; POP_MUSIC : FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS OF ROCK ' N ' ROLL , HOLLYWOOD GIVES THE BEST SONG OSCAR TO A PURE ROCK SONGWRITER FOR ' STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Welcome , Oscar , to the rock ' n ' roll era . Forty years after the recording debut of Elvis Presley , a best song Oscar was awarded to a pure rock songwriter -- Bruce Springsteen -- for the first time . Too_bad they didn ' t have a second Oscar for Neil Young . It was a magical moment when Springsteen stood_in his tuxedo jacket at center stage and sang &quot; Streets of Philadelphia , &quot; the touching ballad about a man whose body is being destroyed by AIDS : I walked the avenue ' til My legs felt_like stone I heard the voices of friends Vanished and gone The song not only set the mood in Jonathan Demme ' s film , &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; where it was played over the opening credits , but the simplicity of its presentation Monday night brought a chilling , topical urgency to the Oscar telecast . As powerful as it was , Young -- whose title song from the same film was also nominated -- nearly matched the drama with an equally heartfelt rendition of_his_own song . Sitting at the piano , Young captured in his near-falsetto voice the heartache of someone refusing to surrender his dignity or hope : Sometimes I think that I know What love ' s all about And when I see the light I know I ' ll be all_right . It was most fitting when Springsteen , in accepting his Oscar , said , &quot; Neil , I ' m gonna share this with you. &quot; Before we think that Springsteen ' s victory is a turning point in the Oscars / rock gap , here ' s a sobering thought : Take_away Springsteen and Young ' s six minutes , and what did we have ? Pretty much Oscar music as usual . Janet Jackson sang &quot; Again , &quot; the ballad she wrote with James Harris II and Terry Lewis for &quot; Poetic Justice , &quot; with intimacy and class . Still , the song is fairly conventional . Dolly Parton and James Ingram did their best to inject some life into &quot; The Day I Fall_in_Love , &quot; but the song is fairly undistinguishable from 400 # 000 others in the same gushy genre . As if the song from &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd &quot; weren ' t sentimental enough , the telecast added scenes from old dog movies . Arf . Keith Carradine also tried his best to bring_out the charm in &quot; A Wink and a Smile , &quot; but the cutesy song by Marc Shaiman and Ramsey McLean is also in worn-out Hollywood tradition . This time , the supporting film_clips showed various film_stars winking_at the camera . Barf . Hopefully , the impact of Springsteen and Young ' s music in &quot; Philadelphia &quot; and on the telecast will serve as a bridge between Hollywood and the rock community . The closest the Oscar voters have gotten_to honoring rock in the past was best original song score awards to the Beatles in 1970 for &quot; Let It Be &quot; and to Prince in 1984 for &quot; Purple Rain. &quot; It ' s no wonder , then , that rock artists have been suspicious for years of Hollywood , sensing producers simply wanted to exploit the artists to attract a young audience . When Demme reached_out to Springsteen and Young , however , he did so with purpose and respect . And their responses validated Demme ' s decision . The celebration of that partnership with an Oscar on Monday night was a sign that Hollywood ' n ' rock is an idea whose time has come . Better late than never .</TEXT>
