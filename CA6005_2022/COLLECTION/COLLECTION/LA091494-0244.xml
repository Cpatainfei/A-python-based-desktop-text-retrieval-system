   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; AS ELECTIONS DRAW NEAR , CLINTON IS SHAPING_UP AS THE GOP ' S BEST_FRIEND ; REPUBLICANS EVOKE THE PRESIDENT AT EVERY CHANCE ; DEMOCRATS COUNTER BY STRESSING LOCAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When New York Rep . Louise M . Slaughter ' s Republican challenger assails her as a tax-and-spend liberal , she changes the subject . Instead of discussing national issues , the hard-pressed Rochester , N.Y. , Democrat points to the rewards she has helped her town win from Washington : an airport expansion , a new high-tech research facility and harbor improvements to protect against the ravages of Lake_Ontario . The contest between Slaughter and GOP challenger Renee Davison illustrates the head-on collision between the overall political strategies being pursued by the two major parties in the November election , in which nearly 500 House and Senate seats are at stake . Mindful of the widespread voter discontent over national issues , Republicans are trying to make this campaign a referendum on the party in power . Democrats , putting their faith in the old axiom that all politics is local , are striving to define each race in terms of what it means for each individual political battleground . &quot; Nationally there ' s an anti-incumbent mood , and a mood against President Clinton , &quot; says Slaughter ' s media consultant , Joe Trippi . &quot; If you get enmeshed in that , you lose . But if you can get voters to focus_on what you as a member of Congress have done for local people , you have a good chance of winning. &quot; The difference between the two approaches reflects the sharply contrasting outlooks for each party . &quot; I am very bullish , &quot; says Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour . &quot; We have not only had a strong wind at our backs for more_than a year , but in the last few weeks that wind has actually picked up. &quot; On the Democratic side , his party ' s condition reminds Philadelphia-based consultant Saul Shorr of the after-the-battle scene from &quot; Gone With the Wind. &quot; &quot; It ' s like I ' m in the middle of Atlanta with all those bodies , and all I hear is moaning , &quot; says Shorr , who advises 22 candidates around the country . &quot; When I get_on conference_calls with people I haven ' t talked to for a while , I ask , ' What do you see out there ? ' They say , ' Disaster. ' &quot; To avoid debacle , many Democratic candidates are trying to distance themselves from Clinton and his sagging polls . But Republicans have no intention of allowing that to happen . GOP candidates will find ways to &quot; attach the local incumbent to President Clinton , &quot; predicts pollster Bill McInturff , whose firm counsels about 60 GOP House and Senate candidates . &quot; Republicans will say , ' These Democrats are not independent . Every time their votes were needed they voted for the President. ' &quot; Some Democratic strategists contend that the Republicans are exaggerating Clinton ' s impact on the election . &quot; I don ' t think this election is about the President per se , &quot; says pollster Mark Mellman , who counsels 18 candidates around the country . &quot; Clinton is only part of the background for the campaign . In the foreground are the individual candidates , and the results will depend_on how people evaluate them against each other. &quot; For Democratic incumbents , one key to reelection is to demonstrate how they use their power and status in Washington for the sake of their constituents . &quot; It could be a hospital or a road , &quot; says pollster Alan Secrest , who advises about 30 House candidates . &quot; But often , it ' s something more compelling. &quot; Facing a primary challenge last June , Rep . Mike Parker ( D-Miss. ) used a commercial that focused_on his successful battle against the Social_Security bureaucracy on behalf of an elderly constituent . Secrest expects the effort will help Parker in the general_election , too . &quot; The point is to make plain the fact that your stewardship makes a difference in the day-to-day lives of your voters , &quot; Secrest says . Democratic challengers , as well as incumbents , also are relying heavily on local issues and concerns . In Iowa ' s 2nd District , former Rep . Dave Nagle ' s aides say he is trying to win_back the seat he lost to Republican Jim Nussle in 1992 by contending that Nussle ' s vote against a farm aid bill would have cost his constituents about $ 19 million in federal aid . Although Nagle doesn ' t often mention Clinton in his campaign , he does attack Nussle for voting against the federal crime bill that Clinton helped push_through the House . &quot; I think you are going_to run_into problems if you pretend you don ' t know the man ( Clinton ) , &quot; Nagle said . &quot; I think the proper thing to say is : ' I ' m going_to work with the President when I agree with him. ' But you ' re better_off talking_about your solutions to problems than his solutions. &quot; Because of the nature of their office , it is more difficult for Democratic Senate candidates to separate themselves from the national party and national issues than House candidates -- but most try . In commercials for 15 Democratic Senate candidates provided by the Democratic Senate_campaign committee , the federal_government was generally depicted , even by incumbents , as a force that needed to be wrestled to the ground , and the stress on local roots and loyalties was pronounced . &quot; You ' ll see me fighting for Utah , &quot; pledges Pat Shea , Democratic challenger in Utah . &quot; Working hard for Virginia , &quot; is the way incumbent Democrat Charles S . Robb described himself to Old_Dominion voters . &quot; Standing_up for New Mexico , &quot; is the way incumbent Jeff Bingaman depicts himself . In Montana , challenger Jack Mudd claimed as a prime credential the fact that he &quot; is not a politician &quot; and he &quot; has never held office. &quot; In more_than 50 Democratic commercials in those 15 races , Clinton ' s name was mentioned only once . Although the ads frequently referred to welfare reform and crime legislation , there was no mention that both issues have been high on Clinton ' s domestic agenda . Republican Senate challengers show no such reluctance about using the President ' s name . In New Mexico , an ad for Colin McMillan , the GOP candidate against Bingaman , depicts Clinton promising during the campaign not to raise taxes on the middle_class , a pledge McMillan claims he has broken . The ad also charges that Clinton is counting_on Bingaman to help pass his &quot; liberal agenda. &quot; In Tennessee , Republican challenger Bill First is airing a commercial that shows an imaginary Mt . Rushmore featuring the visages of three-term incumbent Sen . Jim Sasser , Clinton , Massachusetts Sen . Edward M . Kennedy and indicted Illinois Democratic Rep . Dan Rostenkowski . In Virginia , Republican Oliver L . North ' s commercial claims that Robb votes with Clinton 95 % of the time , and &quot; voted to help Bill_Clinton raise your taxes. &quot; Republicans claim that their efforts to nationalize the election are not all negative . Later this month , House Republican incumbents and candidates will unite behind their leadership to present a 10-part legislative package , including measures to cut taxes , balance the budget and reform the welfare system . Senate Republican incumbents and challengers plan a similar demonstration . &quot; We ' re coming_forward in a high-profile way and saying , ' Look , this is exactly what we are for , ' &quot; says Barbour . &quot; Our real strength is issues . We ' ve got better ideas than Democrats. &quot; Whatever tactics the two parties use , both sides agree that the Democrats already face a handicap when it comes_to voter enthusiasm and anticipated turnout . As a result of the national sense of frustration with politics in_general , and with Clinton ' s performance in particular , Democrats seem likely to face a harder job getting their supporters to the polls . GOP pollster McInturff says that anti-Clinton citizens are more energized than Clinton backers . Of those who disapprove of the job Clinton is doing , 55 % say they are interested in the election , according to McInturff ' s surveys , while of those who approve of the President ' s performance , only 40 % are interested . Acknowledging the problem , House Democratic Campaign Chairman Rep . Vic Fazio of Sacramento says Democrats need to work harder at making the electorate aware of their accomplishments , such_as deficit reduction and the crime bill . &quot; We haven ' t effectively told our story , and we need to do that. &quot;</TEXT>
