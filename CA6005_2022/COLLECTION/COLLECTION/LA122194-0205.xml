   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; CHIP FIASCO ASIDE , INTEL STILL LEADER -- SO FAR ; COMPUTERS : WHETHER ITS MARKET MONOPOLY WILL BE HURT REMAINS UNCLEAR . SOME DOUBT IT WILL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While computer vendors and industry_analysts on Tuesday generally hailed Intel Corp. ' s decision to replace defective Pentium chips &quot; no questions asked , &quot; it is not clear whether the chip giant has avoided long-term damage to its position as the near-monopoly supplier of personal_computer microprocessors . Many observers tend to dismiss the possibility that Intel ' s market position has been hurt . The PC standard , after all , is still based on Intel chips and Microsoft software , and Intel ' s bungled handling of a relatively minor glitch in the Pentium chip does not change that . &quot; The reality is that Intel owns that code . It ' s still got a monopoly . It ' s still got us all by a chokehold , and it ' s pretty hard to shake , even when they shoot themselves in the foot , &quot; says Stewart Alsop , editor of Infoworld , a computer trade publication . While AMD and Cyrix have built profitable businesses by &quot; cloning &quot; Intel chips , both are still a long way from a clone of the Pentium -- and the task gets more difficult with each subsequent chip generation . Intel can spend many times more_than these rivals on R &amp; D and manufacturing . Competitors that offer faster microprocessors based on so-called RISC technology -- notably the Power PC alliance of IBM , Apple , and Motorola -- still must face the reality that the overwhelming majority of PC software is written for Intel processors and Microsoft software . And yet , even the Intel monopoly is not forever . The company may have not only lost credibility with consumers , but also sufficiently angered its already disgruntled PC customers that they will be doubly motivated to consider alternatives . Microsoft , whose position is in some ways similar to Intel ' s , is watching carefully , and said Tuesday it will delay shipment of a new operating_system to avoid bugs . Apple Computer , whose Power PC offers comparable performance to the Pentium-based computers without using the Intel chip , said its sales had already benefited from the Pentium flaw . &quot; Customers are turning_in their Pentiums to buy Power MacIntoshes , especially in situations where they ' ve noticed mistakes in their work , &quot; said Apple spokesman Eric Wee . Some analysts said Intel ' s weeks of inaction -- which left computer manufacturers on_their_own to allay consumer fears -- would make them rethink their long-term commitment to Intel . &quot; This is certainly the kind of problem that makes the PC manufacturers nervous and angry , &quot; said Bluestein . &quot; This will add impetus on the part of Packard Bell and Dell and Gateway to go_through the same strategic reassessment that Compaq and IBM went_through about their reliance on Intel as a chip supplier. &quot; IBM , the company with the deepest roots in corporate computing and one that has never been successful in the consumer PC market , may come_out looking best of all as the Pentium crisis winds down . With its decision early on to stop shipping Pentium-based computers and its continuing pressure on Intel to concede its problems , the company bought a lot of customer goodwill . But whether Intel ' s apology is as sincere as it says -- and whether it will assimilate the culture of the consumer market into its own -- has yet to be seen . And if it doesn ' t , that could mean more problems down the road . Says a cynical Alsop : &quot; I don ' t detect that Andy Grove has learned his lesson . All he ' s saying is despite the fact that this is a really minor bug and no one should care about it , we ' re going to have to do something about it because of all_the fuss . that ' s Intel , though . It ' s just a bunch of engineers that still haven ' t learned how to deal with the real world. &quot; * MAIN STORY : Intel offers to replace chips .
