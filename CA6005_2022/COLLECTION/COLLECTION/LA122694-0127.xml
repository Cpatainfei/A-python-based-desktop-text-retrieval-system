   <HEADLINE> SAMSUNG PLAN RILES S . KOREAN AUTO_MAKERS ; INDUSTRY : THE TWO LARGEST PRODUCERS FOR THE COUNTRY THAT WANTS TO BE A TOP CAR EXPORTER HAVE U.S. HEADQUARTERS IN O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A recent government decision to let the powerful Samsung Business Group build passenger_cars opens the door to a potentially painful battle among South_Korea ' s auto_makers , but analysts say it could also help the auto_makers become formidable competitors in the world market . The decision -- driven by South_Korea ' s ambition to become a top auto exporter -- also marks a sharp break_with traditions of close government guidance and of concentrating resources among a handful of key players in each major industry . &quot; No longer will the government be able to control industrial-sector decisions to launch into new business , &quot; said Lee Youn Ho , an analyst at the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute . &quot; In the short term , there will be some trouble among local automobile makers over scouting workers . But in the long_run , Samsung ' s entry was inevitable , because they should compete with the world ' s big players in the 21st Century. &quot; Samsung plans to make 65 # 000 vehicles in 1998 , with capacity rising to 285 # 000 units in 2000 and to 500 # 000 units in 2002 . Samsung says it will export 30 % of its output in the first year and aim for 55 % exports by 2002 . South_Korea ' s two largest car_makers , Hyundai Motor Co . and Kia Motors Corp. , also are big exporters and both have U.S. headquarters in Orange County . A third manufacturer , Daewoo Motor Co. , has begun exploring the option of direct sales in the United States -- the company now builds some cars sold by General Motors -- and has earmarked Orange County as a potential headquarters site . * Samsung , the largest of South_Korea ' s business conglomerates , has contracted with Japan ' s Nissan Motor Co . for engine technology at a cost of $ 68 million , plus a royalty of 1.6 % to 1.9 % on each vehicle sold , according to the Tokyo-based Nikkei Weekly . Samsung Heavy Industries Co. , the unit going_into passenger_car production , already makes 1 # 200 trucks a year with Nissan ' s technical cooperation . Now Samsung is betting_on automobiles over electronics . &quot; This is not just another addition of business to Samsung , &quot; said Kim Moo , Samsung Heavy ' s senior managing director . &quot; Samsung ' s major business_activities are concentrated_on home_appliance electronics . We have come_to the conclusion that the group will not grow . . . in the 21st Century on electronics . The future lies_in cars. &quot; South_Korea turned_out 2 million cars and trucks last year and exported nearly 640 # 000 of them . It is already the sixth-largest auto-producing nation . Its four other major auto_makers are planning dramatic increases in production capacity , with an eye to sharp boosts in exports . These firms plan to invest about $ 10 billion to double their capacity in five years to more_than 5 million cars , of which 3 million would be shipped abroad . Many in the field believe , however , that these goals are overly ambitious . &quot; The companies ' targets are always bigger than reality , &quot; said Chung Tae Seung , managing director for overseas planning at Kia Motors . &quot; If you add_up all_the targets of Hyundai , Daewoo and Kia , it ' s too big . You have to discount it . . . . There ' s a limit . It ' s dangerous if we overexpand our capacity. &quot; The Samsung decision , which had been pending for months , adds momentum to President Kim Young Sam ' s economic liberalization drive . The government also has taken steps to ease currently tight restrictions on imported cars -- intensifying the domestic industry ' s fears that vigorous expansion may lead to a glutted domestic market . * Against this background , the auto_makers bitterly protested the government ' s approval of Samsung ' s entry as a competitor . Workers at Daewoo Motor Co. , Ssangyong Motor Co. , Kia and its subsidiary Asia Motors Co . protested with strikes and rallies for nearly a week after the government announced the decision -- although at South_Korea ' s largest auto_maker , Hyundai Motor Co. , workers remained on_the_job . The strikes fizzled on Dec . 12 , after it became clear the government would not change_course . When a delegation of auto_company chief_executives visited Deputy Trade Minister Park Un Suh to complain about the Samsung decision , he rebuffed them , Nikkei Weekly reported , with a blunt question : &quot; What were you doing when the government was protecting you ? &quot; Besides increased competition in the domestic market , an even greater concern of Samsung ' s rivals is that Samsung will hire workers and researchers away from them , thereby crippling their expansion plans . Samsung thus was required , as a condition of government permission to build cars , to pledge not to raid its competitors for staff_members . It also promised to start exporting cars in its first year of production and to nurture its own parts suppliers . Rivals , however , remain unconvinced . They say that Samsung will not be able to keep its promises . &quot; At Kia alone , we have 2 # 500 researchers . To train a researcher you need six or seven years of on-the-job experience , &quot; Chung said . &quot; How can Samsung equip itself with researchers without hiring away employees from other firms ? &quot; Samsung insists that enough personnel can be drawn from other group companies , together with researchers and technicians from abroad , to start_up the passenger_car business , said a Samsung Heavy official who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; We have already run advertisements in the United States , including the Los Angeles area , to recruit overseas personnel , &quot; he said . &quot; Samsung publicly submitted a memorandum to the government ( saying ) it would not scout personnel from existing local car_makers . We will keep the promise on the good name of Samsung. &quot; Samsung ' s entry will help to upgrade Korean cars , the executive added . &quot; The car we will be introducing in three years will not be the same quality car that Korean customers are now used to driving , &quot; he said . &quot; If we were to introduce a similar car , it would be meaningless and would not fit Samsung ' s image . &quot; It will be a better car , and that will benefit the customer. &quot; Times staff writer John O ' Dell in Costa Mesa and researcher Chi Jung Nam in Seoul contributed to this story .</TEXT>
