   <TEXT> It ' s a Wednesday afternoon in Hollywood , and Victoria Looseleaf is taping another segment of what she calls one of television ' s &quot; best-kept secrets. &quot; The guest is local chef Mark Peel , who has published a cookbook and brought some samples to the studio at Continental Cablevision . Looseleaf conducts the interview between mouthfuls of grilled asparagus . &quot; Do you really feed your kids these wonderful meals ? &quot; she asks . &quot; How would you describe your culinary philosophy ? &quot; Peel is , of course , plugging his book and restaurant . And the host , a Westside harp teacher , is plugging &quot; The Looseleaf Report , &quot; a half-hour interview show she hopes will someday find a more lucrative home away from cable ' s public-access channels . &quot; There ' s a stigma of being_on public access , but I ' ve risen above that , &quot; Looseleaf says after the taping . &quot; I ' d like to get paid_for my efforts . I have to get an agent and a producer . But ( public access ) is a great training ground. &quot; Twenty-five years after its debut , commercialism is creeping into public-access television . Many viewers have scorned the medium as an inert , amateurish forum for cranks and fringe groups that can ' t get exposure anywhere else . Yet that hasn ' t stopped Looseleaf and legions of other would-be David Lettermans from hoping for crossover success on mainstream television . The irony is that public-access is supposed to be non-commercial , even though experts agree that such rules are made to be broken , or at least bent . Many series are intended as audition tapes for network or syndication deals . Some clever entrepreneurs have even used public access to run barely disguised infomercials for hairstyling , chiropractic and dentistry services . For instance : The Los Angeles Chiropractic Society , a trade association , uses public-access facilities throughout the metropolitan area to produce a series -- &quot; Chiropractic Today and Beyond &quot; -- featuring member doctors and shows on such topics as &quot; Whiplash &quot; and &quot; Manipulation Under Anesthesia. &quot; At the end of each show , viewers are advised to call an 800 number to get more information . Callers are referred to a practitioner in their area . The program has succeeded in building more awareness of chiropractors , says Tony Winders of Murphy O ' Brien Communications , a Beverly Hills-based public-relations firm that developed the 13-part series . Winders acknowledges that public-access rules forbid marketing and advertising , but says &quot; the studios all know &quot; about the series ' goals and haven ' t complained . For such users , the chief advantage to public access is that it costs nothing . In most cases , even the training and materials are free . The tab is picked_up by cable company_operators , who collect their revenue from -- you guessed it -- their customers . Public-access channels are governed by franchise agreements between the cable companies and each city or town . Most communities require users and producers to get training , but otherwise they take a hands-off approach to production and distribution of videotapes . The lack of oversight has made_it easier for users to edge closer to commercialization . In most communities , as long as a program is not explicitly obscene or commercial , public-access administrators must air it unedited . Censoring a program , administrators say , would violate cable franchise agreements and the First_Amendment , though some programmers admit they practice a form of censorship by putting undesirable shows on very late at night . In New York , public access has broadcast nude talk_shows and sex videos . And in Southern California , users have stopped just short of violating bans on advertising and marketing . &quot; On all_the access channels , people have found ways to use it for their own personal agendas , &quot; says Paul Steinbaum , executive_director of Beverly Hills Community Access TV . &quot; that ' s fine as long as they try to follow the guidelines of public access . They can ' t be commercial and they can ' t try to sell a product overtly . &quot; But there are always people pushing the envelope . It ' s become a way of getting advertising without buying advertising . . . or a place for people to create audition tapes ( for free ) . I don ' t think it ' s what public access is supposed to be. &quot; To be sure , public access is not the ideal get-famous-quick scheme . Looseleaf has interviewed hipsters such_as alternative-music performer Henry Rollins , writer Kathy Acker and director Percy Adlon . Yet , after seven years on the air , her show has never been picked_up for syndication or commercial broadcast . Westside author Art Fein , who for 10 years has hosted a roots-music show at Continental ' s Hollywood facility , also has been unable to make the leap to another broadcasting level . Fein has published a book about the Los Angeles rock_music scene and interviewed scores of musicians , but so far he ' s taken the show no further than public access . Its ideal home , he says , would be_on PBS . &quot; Art Fein ' s Poker Party &quot; typically features Fein shooting the breeze with guests such_as country singer Dwight Yoakam and ex-Stray Cat Brian Setzer . As on most public-access shows , lighting , direction and editing are done on the fly , with the final result coming closer to &quot; America ' s Funniest Home Videos &quot; than &quot; The Tonight Show. &quot; &quot; All the shows you see ( on public access ) are auditions , &quot; Fein says . &quot; Not pilots , because pilots have a lot of money and time behind them . ( Public access ) is an outline , a kernel of an idea. &quot; Skip E . Lowe is a retired stand-up comic who spends 30 to 40 hours a week working_on a Beverly Hills interview show with aging stars such_as Stella Stevens , Virginia O ' Brien and Milton Berle . He says he books guests by attending Hollywood parties and chatting_up celebrities who happen to have seen his show . &quot; I ' m a one-man operation , &quot; Lowe says . &quot; I ' ve had many people try to syndicate the show , but they wanted me to sign everything over to them , and I could never do that. &quot; Lowe ' s devotion to his current format may be a rarity among others who appear on public-access TV . Looseleaf , Fein and others hope their tapes will somehow be seen by a channel-surfing media executive on his way to work . Public-access users typically &quot; bicycle , &quot; or import , their tapes to a number of outlets for the largest possible audience . Jeff Cole , director of the UCLA Center for Communication Policy , says that the proximity of major entertainment companies in Southern California has led many users to exploit public access as an audition tool . * Yet most experts say the chances of a public-access show catching_on are extraordinarily slim . &quot; It ' s a pipe_dream , &quot; says Luis Remesar , access coordinator at Continental Cablevision , which produces about 31 new shows per week . Remesar estimates that 90 % of the programs produced at his facility are meant to cross over to network or syndicated TV . &quot; The broadcast industry doesn ' t look_at public access as serious TV , &quot; Remesar says . &quot; Some people might look_at it as the vanguard of TV , but I ' ve never seen a show make_it , other_than ' Mr. Pete. ' &quot; &quot; Mr. Pete , &quot; hosted by Pete Chaconas , was a Letterman-style talk_show on L.A. public access that was briefly picked_up for syndication several years ago . The show did not do_well and was soon dropped . Public access was never conceived as a vehicle for would-be screen_tests . Back in the late 1960s and early ' 70s , nascent cable companies were eager to negotiate franchise agreements with sometimes reluctant cities and towns . To sweeten the pot , the companies agreed to devote one or more channels to public , educational or government ( PEG ) access , with no cost to the user . &quot; The idea was that cable companies would compensate the city for the use of the taxpayers ' ( electronic ) right_of_way , &quot; says Susan Herman , general_manager of the Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications . &quot; The companies would provide public-benefit services , like free drops ( i.e. , hookups ) for schools , hospitals and so on . They would also provide access for governments and the public. &quot; * This access has made_it possible for virtually anyone to get_on the air -- including &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; wanna-bes . Two recent UCLA graduates , Brian Ormsby and Brad Dodge , have spent the past year producing an hourly talk_show called &quot; Too_Much Free Time. &quot; They tape the program near their South Bay home and bicycle it to cable_systems on the Westside -- including Century Cable in Santa Monica -- and to the San Fernando Valley . They estimate they have a potential audience of 670 # 000 households . Ormsby says that &quot; Too_Much Free_Time &quot; taps into the trend toward &quot; real-life TV &quot; pioneered by such shows as MTV ' s &quot; Real_World &quot; and popularized by the movie &quot; Wayne ' s World. &quot; Traditional taste is evidently shelved during taping . One show featured a chat with lesbian strippers . Another featured Ormsby saluting outgoing Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert by dropping his trousers and baring his backside for the camera . &quot; We ' re hoping to make_it big and make a lot of money , &quot; says Ormsby , who is unemployed . Ormsby adds that he and Dodge , a waiter , are seeking sponsors for their program : &quot; We ' re trying to syndicate it ourselves. &quot; Though the odds don ' t favor such a ploy , Herman , the city cable spokeswoman , notes that the 14 franchises overseen by her department cover most of Los Angeles County and reach 520 # 000 households . She says the public-access facilities involved churn_out a systemwide average of 720 half-hour segments every month . Programmers argue that public access will become even more important as cable companies offer hundreds of channels and desperately seek all kinds of programming , whether amateur or professional . If there really are 500 channels , the reasoning goes , quite a_few of them might be devoted to Looseleaf , Fein , Lowe and others . * Which is good for amateur talk-show hosts . But is it good for public-access TV ? &quot; Public access was originally designed for smaller communities that didn ' t have access to the major news media , &quot; says Continental ' s Remesar . &quot; But now , in the smaller communities , no one is doing public access . And in the larger communities , everyone ' s doing_it . In my opinion , it ' s backwards from what it ' s supposed to be. &quot; UCLA ' s Cole is even more blunt in his conclusion . &quot; Public access is an extraordinary resource that hasn ' t been used very effectively , &quot; he says . &quot; That doesn ' t argue against it . It ' s there to be used , stupidly or effectively. &quot;</TEXT>
