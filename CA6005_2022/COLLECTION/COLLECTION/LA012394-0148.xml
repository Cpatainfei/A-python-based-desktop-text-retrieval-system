   <HEADLINE> RIGOBERTA MENCHU ' S MAYAN VISION ; REVERED FOR THE SYMBOLIC POWER OF HER NOBEL PRIZE BUT ATTACKED FOR HER CONTINUING LIFE IN EXILE , THE GUATEMALAN LEADER FOCUSES ON BRINGING A ' NEW DAWN ' TO THE WORLD ' S INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A society of Indian holy_men meets regularly in a Guatemala_City apartment to study the Mayan calendar , a 2 # 500-year-old timekeeping system that is at the center of their religion . In recent years , their reading of the calendar has told them that an ancient prophecy is about to come true : &quot; The time of darkness &quot; is coming_to an end . The Mayan people , exploited for five centuries , second-class citizens in their own land , will soon enter an age of &quot; clarity and brightness. &quot; A new dawn is approaching . El nuevo amanecer . Slowly , inevitably , the priests say , the prophecy is coming true . Ask them for proof and they will tell you about the new organizations that fight for Indian rights and the increasing number of Mayan men and women graduating from Guatemala ' s universities . They will mention the growing ethnic pride among Mayan youth , the girls who are not afraid to wear their traditional garments at school despite the taunts of the ladinos , the European-descended minority that has ruled Guatemala since 1524 . But the most dramatic example of the new dawn ' s arrival , the priests say , can be found in the life_story of a 35-year-old Quiche Mayan woman , a former house_servant and farm_worker named Rigoberto Menchu . Illiterate until the age of 20 , she is now Guatemala ' s most-famous citizen , a woman who regularly meets with heads_of_state and who is recognized as an international leader in the movement for indigenous peoples ' rights . In 1992 , just days after the quincentenary of Christopher Columbus ' arrival in the Americas , she became the first indigenous leader ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot; Rigoberta winning the Nobel Prize is just the first_step , the first sign that the Mayan people must burst into history once again , &quot; says Juan Leon , leader of Majawil K ' ij ( &quot; New Dawn &quot; in the Mam Mayan language ) , a coalition of Mayan cultural and political organizations . &quot; One day , the Mayan people will govern Guatemala . I don ' t know when it will happen , but that is our hope . That is the new dawn we speak of. &quot; Like the Mayan priests whose counsel she occasionally seeks , Menchu also believes_in a Mayan &quot; new dawn. &quot; She describes it while sitting for an interview in a Guatemala_City office . A short woman with a round face that often breaks_into a grin , she is dressed , as always , in the traditional clothing of Guatemalan Indian women -- the huipil ( an embroidered blouse ) and corte ( a multicolored skirt made from handwoven cloth ) . &quot; The priests say the new dawn will be like the rain that fertilizes the soil before we begin to plant our corn , &quot; Menchu says . &quot; It will renew the natural cycle of life . The Mayan people will once again flourish . I believe_in this very strongly . The holy_men say we are entering a period of clarity . We are rediscovering our Mayan values. &quot; Since winning the Nobel Prize , Menchu has worked to spread this vision far beyond the reach of the Mayans . In October , she convened the second Summit of Indigenous Peoples , a conference that assembled leaders of native tribes and ethnic_groups from five continents . In a speech opening the conference , she told the delegates to persevere in their struggle to force the international community to recognize their rights : Menchu wants the United Nations to adopt a global charter to protect the lands and cultural practices of all indigenous peoples . &quot; Our struggle is for peace , harmony and mutual respect between peoples and cultures , &quot; Menchu said , looking_out at an audience that included Maoris from New Zealand , Inuits from the Arctic_Circle , Samis from Scandinavia and Amazon Indians from Brazil and Peru . &quot; But we cannot accept a peace that forces indigenous peoples to renounce their languages , their cultures , their rights , ( that forces them ) to assimilate into non-indigenous society . We say no to the peace that keeps us on our knees , no to the peace that keeps us in chains , no to the false peace that denies the values and contributions of our peoples. &quot; It was the kind of speech -- proud , angry and defiant -- that has made Menchu famous . These qualities have also made her one of the most controversial figures in Central_American politics . Although she is widely praised abroad as an eloquent spokeswoman , at_home she is often the object of scorn and abuse . Most of the Guatemalan media and politicians attack her as a left-wing militant and an underground supporter of the Marxist guerrillas who have waged a 30-year war against the government . Rather than giving her the Nobel Peace Prize , it seems they should have given her the &quot; Nobel War Prize , &quot; the editors of the influential Guatemala_City daily Siglo Veintiuno wrote last year . Menchu has been criticized for , among other things , the hard-line stance she has taken during the country ' s continuing political instability . Although she is not the center of a cohesive political_movement , or the leader of any political organization , Menchu has given voice in the international arena to the aspirations of a long-silenced sector of Guatemalan society -- not just the Mayans , but also poor ladinos and others who call_for sweeping social reform and a quick end to military domination of the government . She has called_for a purge of the executive_branch and army and has attacked recently installed President Ramiro de Leon Carpio , who supports a more gradual reform of the government . But most of all , Menchu ' s defiant Mayan pride doesn ' t sit well with the elite of a country where Indians are a de_facto lower caste , an army of dark-skinned servants and impoverished peasants . Since she received the Nobel Prize , an unease has spread through ladino Guatemala . Some ladinos fear that Menchu ' s rise to prominence is an inkling of Guatemala ' s future , a country turned upside-down where Mayans , who make_up 60 % to 70 % of the population , rule over whites . Many Guatemalans are asking themselves : What do the Mayans want ? A new nationalism has emerged among some members of the small minority of educated and middle-class Mayans . There is talk_of one day re-establishing &quot; Mayan law , &quot; erasing the borders and unifying the Mayan people scattered across Honduras , El_Salvador , Guatemala and southern Mexico . This growing Mayan militancy found a violent expression this month when Indians in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas launched a guerrilla war , capturing several towns . Rebels from the &quot; Zapatista National Liberation Army &quot; said they were acting to preserve their language and way_of_life . In Guatemala , the new Mayan pride shows its face even at the public market , the place where ladinos and Mayans most often come_into contact with one another -- Indian peasants bring baskets of produce from the countryside to sell to ladino city dwellers . &quot; Ever since Rigoberta won the Nobel Prize , these Indians have become unbearable , &quot; says a middle-class Guatemala_City resident . &quot; You go_to the market and you try to barter with them and they get angry with you . They say , ' I won ' t go any lower . Take it or leave it. ' They have too_much pride now . You call them indito ( little Indian ) , and they get mad . They weren ' t like that before. &quot; * MENCHU ROSE TO INTERNATIONAL PROMINENCE AFTER THE PUBLICATION of her 1983 autobiography , &quot; I . . . Rigoberta Menchu : An Indian Woman in Guatemala. &quot; Interviewed by Venezuelan anthropologist Elisabeth Burgos-Debray , Menchu tells of her humble origins in a small village in the highlands of El Quiche . Desperately poor , members of her family are forced to migrate every year to coastal cotton plantations , where they work in slavelike conditions . She herself begins picking coffee when she is 8 . The book reaches a climax as Menchu grows_into womanhood and members of her family become founders of the Committee for Peasant Unity . The organization grows quickly but encounters violent opposition from wealthy landowners and the army . Translated into a dozen languages , the book is considered a key text in the study of Third_World women . It transformed Menchu from a little-known exiled Mayan activist into an international figure . It has also become a favorite punching_bag for conservative critics in the United States . In his book &quot; Illiberal Education , &quot; Dinesh D ' Souza sees Menchu ' s book as a Marxist-feminist tract epitomizing the ultra-radical views held by Burgos-Debray . Others cite it as proof of Menchu ' s support for armed insurrection . They point to a key passage in which Menchu learns her village is about to come under_attack by the army . ( Army officials have admitted destroying about 440 highland villages during a scorched-earth campaign in the early 1980s ) . Rather than run_away or passively resist the invasion , the villagers opt_for armed self-defense . &quot; We knew how to throw stones , we knew how to throw salt in someone ' s face -- how to do_it effectively , &quot; Menchu writes . &quot; We ' ve often used lime . Lime is very fine and . . . we practiced taking_aim and watching where the enemy is . You can blind a policeman by throwing lime in his face. &quot; Stephen Schwartz , author of a book on Nicaraguan Violeta Barrios de Chamorro ' s 1990 election , cited such passages as proof that Menchu was not deserving of the peace prize . &quot; Menchu , to emphasize , does not support peace ; she supports leftist violence , &quot; Schwartz wrote in the American Spectator magazine . &quot; She does not even accept nonviolence as a means of protest . . . . Menchu ' s cause is not that of peace and reconciliation , but of murder and subversion. &quot; Schwartz and others also charge that , even as a Nobel winner , Menchu has worked to support Guatemala ' s Marxist guerrillas in their peace negotiations with the government . ( Guatemala ' s guerrilla insurgency is the last remaining one in Central America. ) During the past year , Menchu has blamed government intransigence for breakdowns in the talks . William Ratliff , a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution in Stanford , says her actions before winning the prize lacked &quot; moral authority. &quot; He questions , for example , how she can be seen as a symbol for the rights of Indian people when she supported the Sandinista government ' s repression of Miskito Indians during the 1980s . &quot; I have no doubt she has ties to the guerrillas , &quot; he adds . &quot; Throwing lime in policemen ' s eyes , that ' s not exactly the kind of thing one expects from a peace laureate. &quot; Even though one of her sisters joined the guerrilla movement , Menchu maintains that she has no contact with the Marxist rebels . Still , she does not hide the fact that she is uncomfortable with the role of peaceful mediator . When more_than 2 # 000 refugees -- nearly all_of them Mayan Indians -- returned to Guatemala from Mexico last January , Menchu chose to ignore the advice of those who told her to avoid the event . The Guatemalan army had opposed the return , saying the refugees were_active supporters of the guerrilla movement . &quot; A lot of people said that this wasn ' t my role , to be wasting my time on these things , &quot; she says . &quot; But I said no . The popular movement gave me life . The struggle gave me life . The people gave me life . So I owe them something in return , even if I am wasting the Nobel Prize. &quot; * IN A RECENT COMMUNIQUE , THE CLANDESTINE &quot; ROMEO LORENZANA ANTI-Communist Movement &quot; called her a &quot; guerrilla &quot; and declared &quot; an open war on this group of communist traitors to the fatherland. &quot; She does not take such threats lightly . Her father , Vicente Menchu , was killed during a 1980 peaceful takeover of the Spanish Embassy , when the Guatemalan army stormed and set fire to the compound . That same year , her mother was kidnaped , raped and tortured for days before being tied to a tree and left to die . Her 16-year-old brother was tortured and burned alive in a Mayan village in 1979 , as soldiers forced villagers to watch . In all , an estimated 120 # 000 people have been killed since the 1970s in Guatemala ' s political violence . According to Amnesty International and other human-rights groups , the military has been responsible_for the majority of these killings . Only a handful of low-ranking army_officers have been prosecuted in connection with these deaths . Menchu has lived_in a self-imposed exile in Mexico since 1981 , and when she visits her homeland , she travels in a gray , armor-plated Jeep Cherokee with green-tinted , bulletproof glass . The Jeep offers a measure of protection against roadside ambushes . &quot; So many people have died here , &quot; Menchu says from the front of her Jeep during a recent six-day visit to Guatemala , &quot; many unknown people , great men and people whom history erases . As long as impunity exists ( for the killers ) , those people will stay buried and forgotten. &quot; But the threat of violence has diminished somewhat since de Leon took power , and Menchu seems relaxed as her Jeep winds through the potholed streets of Guatemala_City . She pulls_out a compact and applies a_few dabs of makeup . Her small entourage is headed for a refugee camp on the outskirts of the city , to visit 250 Mayans displaced by the army ' s counterinsurgency campaign . Outside , it is a typical day in the country known as &quot; the land of eternal spring &quot; -- tropical clouds , verdant hills and volcanoes are fanned across the crystal-blue horizon . When the Jeep pulls into the dusty plot of land , the refugees set_off firecrackers in celebration . She steps_out and is almost immediately surrounded by children . To honor Menchu , the refugees have decorated their wood-scrap and dirt-floor shelters with flowers and colorful paper streamers . Girls in their indigenous dresses_circle Menchu and begin to dance . For a moment , she joins in , playfully teasing the girls , saying they should dance a little faster , with more energy , con mas ganas . Old_women move forward to touch her , approaching her with deep reverence , whispering words to her in Quiche , one of 22 Mayan languages . A man places his newborn son in her arms and asks her to be the child ' s godmother , a comadre . Poems are presented in her honor . &quot; Rigoberta , I will tell you how they treat me in school , &quot; reads a 10-year-old girl . &quot; They call me india because I can ' t speak Spanish well . They forbid me to wear my traje tipico ( traditional Mayan clothes ) . When I play with the other children , they don ' t treat me the same as everyone else . There is discrimination against me . But inside of me , there is a hope. &quot; Such emotional outpourings are not uncommon . When Menchu won the Nobel , 20 # 000 Guatemalans marched in the capital in celebration , many of them poor Mayans who left their work as housekeepers and street vendors to be there . &quot; The poor and the illiterate in Guatemala have never had a leader they could recognize as their own , &quot; says Demetrio Cojti , a Cakchiquel Indian who left his village to earn a doctorate in Belgium and is now a UNICEF official in Guatemala_City . &quot; Rigoberta fills that vacuum with her charisma and all_the things she symbolizes . It ' s the joy of their lives. &quot; Among other things , Menchu symbolizes to her fellow Mayans the attainment of respect and success in the non-indigenous world . Like many of them , Menchu once spoke only Quiche , but now she speaks fluent Spanish . Once , she was illiterate , but now she is a distinguished author . Most Mayans can only dream of such achievements : Cojti points_out that despite recent advances , Mayans still make_up only 25 % of Guatemala ' s elementary_school students , and 1 % of college graduates . It is understandable , then , that when Menchu takes the microphone at the refugee camp to address the crowd , the first thing she tells them is to start a school . &quot; We might have financial limitations , we might be poor , but we can hope for education , &quot; she says , &quot; and we can dream that tomorrow these children will have a chance to build their own nation. &quot; Just before she is to leave , the refugees gather_in a circle while four Mayan priests perform a ceremony . They arrange pine needles and flowers in a circle and burn incense . Menchu joins the refugees in kneeling to pray to the four corners of the earth . The priests call_on the spirits of their ancestors to aid them in the fight against Xibalba , the Mayan underworld . Unlike the Christian hell , Xibalba exists on earth -- army soldiers , police_officers and informers all work for the underworld , the priests say . &quot; It ' s like a government , &quot; a priest explains . When the ceremony is complete , Menchu climbs into the armor-plated Jeep that protects her against Xibalba and drives_away . * MENCHU ONCE AGAIN FOUND HER ACTIONS AT THE CENTER OF DEBATE during a failed government coup in May and June , when then-President Jorge Serrano dissolved Congress and suspended constitutional guarantees , including the right to assembly . As luck would have it , Menchu was making a rare visit to Guatemala at the time , hosting the first Summit of Indigenous Peoples . More_than 200 delegates had gathered_in the town of Chimaltenango , roughly 40 miles west of Guatemala_City . With martial_law suddenly in_force and the potential for violence rapidly escalating , canceling the summit and sending the delegates home seemed the prudent thing to do . But Menchu announced that the summit would go_on as an act of &quot; civil_disobedience &quot; against the coup . &quot; It would have been the most terrible thing in the history of indigenous peoples if we had legitimized the coup by dissolving our summit , &quot; she explained at the time . &quot; I said that anyone who left the summit would never again be recognized as a delegate . A lot of people said this was an intransigent thing to do , that I was putting people ' s lives in danger . But these were very hard political decisions. &quot; As the delegates withdrew into closed_session , Menchu drove to Guatemala_City and helped direct a growing movement against the coup . After attending a Mass for peace , she led 1 # 000 people on a march from the 18th-Century cathedral to the ornate , lime-green Palacio Nacional , the seat of national government . With two_dozen stunned soldiers and the international press corps watching , she delivered a letter to the president demanding the restoration of civil_liberties by slipping it under the closed gates when the guards refused to accept it . Faced with growing defiance of his martial_law decrees , Serrano resigned and fled the country . Then , in one of those strange turn of events that are so common in Central_American politics , Congress named Ramiro de Leon Carpio , the nation ' s progressive human-rights prosecutor , as the new president . Just days earlier , Serrano had ordered de Leon ' s arrest , and the president-to-be had eluded police by climbing to the roof of his house and jumping into a neighbor ' s back yard . De Leon promised to strengthen democracy and enact some badly needed reforms , including an end to rampant corruption in Congress . But Menchu demanded more . She called_for the immediate resignation of the entire Congress , which she labeled as corrupt , and the formation of an assembly to draft a new constitution . At one point during the crisis , she called_for a general strike to force Serrano from power -- but few workers heeded the call . To her detractors , it seemed that Menchu was trying to start a popular insurrection . &quot; We believe Rigoberta ' s actions showed little concern for the reality of the situation , &quot; wrote the editors at the daily Siglo Veintiuno . They accused her of &quot; political immaturity &quot; and said she viewed the crisis as &quot; an opportunity for a revolution that would ruin our political system. &quot; Before the coup , Menchu never claimed to lead anyone , just to speak_for her people . And when the coup gave her an opportunity to play a role in Guatemalan politics , Menchu did what she had always done -- she used her influential voice in the public forums available to her . Without any organized constituency in Guatemala , she could act only as an individual , &quot; a moral witness &quot; to the process . The same tactics had worked well for her in the international stage , where , by recounting her compelling life_story again and again , she helped ostracize a series of military regimes . In the process , she also won a Nobel Prize . But after a decade in exile , could she still be an effective leader in Guatemala ? When asked this question , Nineth Montenegro , leader of Guatemala ' s most tenacious human-rights organization , the Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo , buries her head in her hands . She is about to say something critical about a natural ally , something she ' d rather not do . Clearly , Montenegro says , Menchu ' s work abroad has helped the human-rights movement . But remaining in exile -- even when most other exiles have already returned -- has stolen much of her thunder in Guatemala . &quot; Those of us who have stayed here ( in Guatemala ) have a certain moral authority &quot; in the movement , Montenegro says . &quot; We ' ve stayed here despite all_the killings . If we had gone_into exile , we would have lost that authority . That can ' t be denied. &quot; Still , Menchu ' s statements during the coup affirmed the desire of many Guatemalans for profound change . For years , presidents have come and gone_in Guatemala without any reform in the secretive structures of power ( especially in the military ) that have given_birth to so_much terror and repression . Without a purge of army_officers linked to death squads , for example , de Leon ' s appointment as president might be little more_than a new , democratic facade for the same murderous regime . To a certain degree , Menchu ' s position has been borne_out during the past few months . De Leon has proven to be a less-than-effective leader , apparently unwilling to challenge the military leadership he routinely criticized while he was human-rights prosecutor . He dramatically reversed an earlier position by enthusiastically supporting the army ' s Civilian Self-Defense Patrols , which have been accused by international groups , including the Organization of American_States , of gross human-rights violations . Not surprisingly , Menchu has grown increasingly critical of the president . When de Leon presented a new peace plan in October , Menchu said it was designed to force the guerrilla movement away from the negotiating table and insinuated that he was being manipulated by the military . She called a news_conference in Mexico to announce that she was &quot; withdrawing my vote_of_confidence &quot; for him . A week later in Washington , D.C. , Menchu renewed her attacks on de Leon . For her critics back home , it was just another example of Menchu using her access to the media outside Guatemala to prejudice international opinion against the country ' s struggling democracy . &quot; I think the people of Guatemala would be more pleased with her if she would help us , with her influence and leadership , to build peace , &quot; says presidential press secretary Felix Loarca . &quot; When she says , for example , that she is withdrawing her vote_of_confidence for the president , I don ' t think that ' s the right way . Instead of having these confrontations that never lead to anything constructive , we beg her to use her influence to help us. &quot; Still , Loarca says neither he nor the president bear Menchu any ill_will . &quot; I myself asked her once if she would do me the honor of autographing her book for me , &quot; he says with a smile . Like Loarca , many Guatemalans feel ambivalent toward Menchu . Loarca might be distressed by Menchu ' s political posturing , but she is , after all , a Nobel Prize_winner . And in a poor country permeated by a collective sense of low self-esteem , such triumphs mean a great_deal . * TO DEDICATE HERSELF to the revolution , Menchulong ago renounced marriage and motherhood , parting company with a fiance with &quot; much sadness and a heavy heart. &quot; In private , she can speak harshly of her opponents , using mild swear words like cabron , bastard . She is known for her toughness , yet she wept openly when it was announced that she had won the Nobel Prize , remembering the deaths of her family members . And she is not above a little self-effacing humor . When her Jeep develops a flat_tire on a bumpy Guatemala_City road , she jokes about her being fat . &quot; Well , no wonder the tire popped , &quot; she says , standing on the flattened tire her driver has just removed . &quot; Look , it can ' t even hold my weight. &quot; Everyone laughs . There is a feeling among some ladino commentators that , as a self-educated Mayan woman , Menchu doesn ' t possess the intellectual capacity to be a power player in Guatemalan politics . So tainted is the racial atmosphere in Guatemala that people have few qualms about expressing such thoughts publicly . Consider the published comments of Carlos Manuel Pellecer , a columnist for the country ' s largest daily , La Prensa Libre . He called Menchu &quot; an ingenuous and poorly counseled muchacha . &quot; Muchacha ( girl ) is what Guatemalans call their servants . The Nobel Prize , Pellecer said , &quot; is obviously too grand for her. &quot; In private , the racial hostility can be expressed more brazenly . Menchu ' s growing notoriety has led to an endless stream of Rigoberta jokes , many of which cast her in the role of country bumpkin : A simple peasant thrust into a high-class society she does not understand . One joke reminds Guatemalans that even in death , she will always be a member of the servant class : &quot; Rigoberta died and went_to heaven , &quot; the story goes . &quot; But she showed_up at the pearly gates wearing her huipil and her corte . So St . Peter takes one look_at her and says : ' Hey , Jesus , the tortillas are here ! ' &quot; Menchu has endured such racist jokes and comments all her life . She speaks with quiet , restrained anger as she remembers what people said when she first spoke on Guatemalan television in 1988 , when she returned openly to the country for the first time since going_into exile . Having been arrested , thrown_in jail , and then released from custody , she denounced the authorities , breezing_through her interviews in erudite and eloquent Spanish . Many Guatemalans were amazed . &quot; People said , ' Rigoberta Menchu speaks better than a ladino , &quot; ' Menchu remembers . &quot; ' Her Spanish is perfect . It ' s incredible that she ' s so intelligent. ' As if intelligence belonged_to only one sector of the population . There were aberrant assertions that I must have been trained to speak by East_German ( Communists ) agents because I couldn ' t have learned all this on my own. &quot; * EVEN AS SHE WAS BEING DISPARAGED at_home , her recognition was growing abroad . In the weeks before the Nobel committee announced the recipient of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize , Indian activists all_over the world were busy organizing protests to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus ' arrival in the Americas . It appeared that the committee would acknowledge the quincentenary by awarding the prize to an indigenous leader . Still , the ideal candidate was not immediately obvious . There was no Nelson Mandela or Martin_Luther_King Jr . whose moral and personal authority granted them unquestioned leadership of the movement . Menchu , who had been struggling for more_than a decade to pressure the international community to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples , &quot; was one of a number of people who might have been chosen , &quot; says Howard R . Berman , professor of international_law at the California Western School_of_Law in San Diego . &quot; The movement is very diverse and there ' s not one central leader. &quot; But , Berman adds , &quot; Rigoberta was an excellent choice . She ' s very highly regarded and a person of great integrity. &quot; Indigenous activists agree that the prize has granted new visibility and legitimacy to their struggle . Since accepting the $ 1.2-million award , Menchu has found herself thrust into a new role as the leading spokeswoman for the international movement . With more moral than financial_support from the U.N. bureaucracy ( Menchu complains that the U.N. provided her with a measly $ 47 # 000 ) , she used her one-year goodwill ambassadorship to convene two international summits . At Menchu ' s invitation , and with part of her Nobel award paying some of the costs , more_than 100 leaders from five continents attended . The delegates agreed to ask the U.N. to declare the period between 1994 and 2004 the international decade of indigenous peoples , and last December , the U.N. General_Assembly approved the decade , which will begin this Dec . 10 . Under Menchu ' s leadership , the summit delegates also developed a plan to push the U.N. to approve the draft declaration on indigenous peoples ' rights . The declaration must still work its way through a labyrinth of U.N. committees before being presented to the General_Assembly for final consideration . The document declares that indigenous peoples have the right to protect their lands , cultural practices and natural_resources . Although the declaration would not have the force of international_law , it could be the first_step toward the adoption of an international convention on indigenous peoples ' rights , similar to the Geneva_Convention on the protection of prisoners and medical personnel in wartime . &quot; She was supposed to take the position as goodwill ambassador and pose for posters and show_up for tea in Vienna and Geneva , &quot; says Mililani B . Trask , a summit delegate representing the indigenous peoples of Hawaii . &quot; She ' s gone way beyond anything they ( the U.N. ) ever expected . They wanted her to be a symbol but she had the integrity to not do that. &quot; * MAYAN CALENDAR PRIESTS have kept a continuous count of the days over a period of 25 centuries . On the day that Quiche priest Nicolas Lucas is interviewed , the Mayan calendar reads &quot; 12 Ix &quot; ( pronounced eesh ) . The coming of the &quot; new dawn , &quot; Lucas says , was foretold by Mayan priests three years before the arrival of the first European , conquistador Pedro de Alvarado , who defeated the army of Quiche warriors led by Tecun Uman . The priests predicted a long period of darkness would follow the conquest . But one day the sun would return . &quot; The new dawn is about to rescue our culture , &quot; Lucas says . &quot; Our ancestors said the moment would arrive in which their children and grandchildren would wake_up again and see this light . We ' ve been lost for 500 years but it ' s not possible to continue the same way . We have to take action. &quot; But asked why the Mayan calendar says the new dawn is coming now , Lucas is a little less forthcoming . He says he has been studying the calendar for 30 years and &quot; to explain all that , I would need a year . Maybe two. &quot; Most Mayans don ' t need to have mastered the complexities of their calendar to know change is long overdue . Since founding the &quot; New Dawn &quot; coalition in 1991 , Juan Leon has seen a remarkable growth in Mayan political and cultural organizations . But he believes that the day of Mayan dominance is still a long way off . Nor is it the goal of his movement . &quot; Some people think what we want to do is to throw all_the ladinos out of Guatemala and send them back to Spain , &quot; Leon says . &quot; that ' s not our intention. &quot; The Mayans , he says , only want to live_in a country where ladinos and Mayans treat each other with respect . Menchu expressed similar thoughts in her speech in Oslo when she accepted the Nobel Prize : &quot; Combining all_the shades of ladinos , Africans and indigenous peoples that make_up the ethnic mosaic of Guatemala , we should interlace a variety of colors , making them shine , weaving as our artisans do. &quot; The result , Menchu believes , will be a huipil , an intricate , rainbow-colored garment that will be Guatemala ' s gift to humanity .</TEXT>
