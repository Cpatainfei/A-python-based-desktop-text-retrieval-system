   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS ; VOTERS TO SETTLE LAND BATTLE IN ARIZONA ; PROPOSITION 300 HAS BECOME RALLYING POINT FOR THOSE WHO SEE GOVERNMENT REGULATORS AS A THREAT TO PROPERTY RIGHTS . ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY IT WILL HURT THE WILDERNESS , TAXPAYERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Election_Day , the eyes of America ' s environmental movement will be_on Arizona . And a good chunk of its money will be there too . In one of the nation ' s fastest-growing states , voters intent_on protecting their private_property from government regulators are squaring_off against environmental activists . Proposition 300 would direct Arizona state agencies to analyze how any new regulation would affect the value of private_property and determine whether and how much citizens should be compensated for their losses . The outcome is expected to reverberate powerfully in Washington and in statehouses across the nation . The proposition is one of dozens of &quot; private_property rights &quot; measures springing_up in states and gaining_ground on Capitol_Hill . Once a crusade embraced only by libertarians and conservative constitutional scholars , private_property rights has become the rallying cry_for citizen backlash in an angry political year . A victory in Arizona would boost the fledgling movement , as well as demonstrate how general voter unhappiness with government can be harnessed and converted to pursue a specific political goal . Proponents of Proposition 300 argue that the measure would uphold a cherished constitutional principle : The government may_not deprive citizens of private_property without just compensation . &quot; It ' s time for us to make the unaccountable government -- the bureaucracy -- responsible_for what they do and how it affects private_property and the business_community , &quot; said Linda McClure , a spokeswoman for Arizonans for Private_Property Rights . The movement is financed heavily by commercial developers , bankers and mining and timber industries , although its supporters include many small landowners who charge that they have been denied use of their property by laws and regulations intended to protect the environment , preserve historic sites and assure public health and safety . Environmentalists warn that Proposition 300 and similar measures will cost taxpayers dearly and erode the government ' s ability to protect the environment and public health and safety . It is &quot; the single most important environmental referendum on the ballot this year , &quot; said Daniel J . Weiss , political director of the Sierra Club . Betsy Loyless , political director for the League of Conservation Voters , an advocacy group , said the measure is &quot; a boondoggle and a scam &quot; on Arizona voters . &quot; This proposition will allow polluters to tell their communities , ' If you don ' t like what I want to do on my property , then pay me not to pollute , pay me not to locate here. ' &quot; Property-rights advocates have focused_on two categories of national and state laws -- those preserving wetlands and those protecting the habitat of plants and animals considered in danger of extinction . Largely without providing compensation to landowners , the federal Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act -- under which federal wetlands policy is administered -- have blocked activities ranging from logging to the construction of shopping_malls and subdivisions on privately owned lands . With less than a week to go , each side has taken_to Arizona ' s airwaves with a vengeance . Polls sponsored last week by proponents showed the measure leading slightly , but nearly half of Arizona voters were still undecided . The issue arises at a time when the environmental movement has suffered a series of legislative defeats on Capitol_Hill . Many activists have concluded that the best chance of strengthening environmental protection now is through regulation -- a tortuous process by which federal agencies , not Congress , adopt new rules . Even that strategy could be thwarted if the private-property-rights movement begins racking_up victories in Washington . House and Senate lawmakers already have proposed legislation that would go well beyond Arizona ' s proposition by requiring compensation for any federal regulation that would devalue a piece_of_land by 50 % . &quot; When the new Congress arrives , we ' re going to find a much more friendly audience , &quot; predicted Rep . W.J. ( Billy ) Tauzin ( D-La. ) , one of the House ' s most fiery advocates of such measures . &quot; The momentum is growing. &quot; Both sides describe Proposition 300 as a fight between David and Goliath -- and each side claims to be the little guy . Last week , with both sides reporting their financial assets , backers of Proposition 300 had twice as much money on_hand as those opposing the measure . In all , Arizonans for Private_Property Rights has raised $ 598 # 000 and attracted the attention of at least one national organization , the National Assn . of Realtors , which has contributed $ 50 # 000 . The Arizona Community Protection Committee , which is organizing the campaign against Proposition 300 , reported Oct . 27 that it had raised $ 240 # 000 . Campaign treasurer Sandy Bahr said the total included $ 100 # 000 raised by the Arizona chapter of the Sierra Club , $ 5 # 000 from the Sierra Club ' s national political_action_committee , and a $ 5 # 000 contribution from the Wilderness Society . Late last week the League of Conservation Voters ' political_action_committee dispatched $ 62 # 500 for the fight .</TEXT>
