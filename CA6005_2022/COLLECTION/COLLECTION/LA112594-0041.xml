   <HEADLINE> GOP TARGETING HUGE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In August , a New Mexico jury handed_down a $ 2.7-million punitive damage verdict against McDonald ' s Corp . because an elderly woman said she had been burned by hot coffee that she spilled on her leg . The jury had already awarded her $ 160 # 000 to cover medical_bills and pay_for her suffering . The extra award was intended to punish the big hamburger company for making its coffee too hot . In September , a San Francisco law_firm was hit with a $ 6.9-million punitive verdict because one of its partners had sexually harassed a female employee . A week later , an Alaska jury hit Exxon Corp . with a $ 5-billion punitive verdict , this on top of $ 3.8 billion that the company had paid_out in fines and damage verdicts for the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill . A month ago , a jury in Las Vegas handed up a $ 5-million punitive verdict , on top of a $ 1.6-million compensatory award , against the Hilton Hotels Corp . because it failed to prevent drunk Navy and Marine aviators from molesting a woman attending the Tailhook Assn . convention . To corporate attorneys this latest round of huge punitive verdicts shows that despite a decade of clamoring for reform , the legal_system is still out of control . &quot; It ' s getting_worse , not better . It ' s become a giant lottery , &quot; said Washington attorney Theodore B . Olson , who has repeatedly challenged punitive verdicts before the Supreme Court . But suddenly , this month ' s elections have given the business_community newfound optimism . Republican candidates for Congress and state offices reported that one of the biggest applause lines was to attack &quot; crazy lawsuits. &quot; Now , after capturing control of Capitol_Hill and 15 new statehouses , they are promising the most sweeping changes ever in the nation ' s liability laws . &quot; At the federal level , the climate for tort reform has never been better , &quot; said Sherman Joyce , president of the American Tort Reform Assn. , a lobbying coalition whose members range from Boeing Co . and Exxon to the American Camping Assn . and the Ski Industries Assn . &quot; The prospects also look good all across the country , &quot; he said , noting that Republicans made big gains in California , Illinois , Michigan and Texas . The big losers are the trial_lawyers , consumer advocates who until this year have fought_off significant changes in the liability laws . While a majority of senators has favored federal restrictions on product-liability lawsuits , those measures were blocked by a handful of key Democrats allied_with the trial_lawyers . In the next Congress , the Republicans promise to pass a series of &quot; common-sense legal reforms , &quot; including the first-ever federal limits on product-liability suits . Their &quot; contract with America &quot; proposes to &quot; discourage frivolous lawsuits &quot; by making the losers pay the defendant ' s costs and to put &quot; reasonable limits on punitive damages. &quot; * In product-liability cases , such_as the hot-coffee case , the Republican proposal would limit the punitive award to three times the actual damages or $ 250 # 000 , whichever is higher . Because the jury in the coffee case said the scalded woman was_due $ 160 # 000 to pay_for her injuries , it could then award her $ 480 # 000 in punitive damages . It should be noted that a trial_judge in Albuquerque later reduced the punitive verdict against McDonald ' s to $ 480 # 000 , three times the actual damages voted by the jury . But consumer advocates say big punitive verdicts -- or even threats of such huge awards -- are needed to force giant corporations to change their ways . &quot; It takes a lot of money to send a message to Exxon , GM ( General Motors Corp. ) or McDonald ' s , &quot; said Pamela Gilbert , director of Congress Watch for consumer advocate Ralph Nader ' s Public Citizen project . &quot; The McDonald ' s case is a perfect example . This ( punitive verdict ) was actually two days of their profits from selling coffee . It was big enough to get their attention and to get them to change their practices so they won ' t scald consumers with coffee that ' s too hot , &quot; she said . But Gilbert says she realizes that the consumer groups face an uphill battle in stopping new federal product-liability legislation in 1995 . The GOP and business lawyers say they will press a liability-reform bill next year that , besides limiting punitive damages , would : * Free retailers and distributors from most product-liability suits . Now , those who are hurt by defective products usually sue not only the manufacturer but whoever sold the product . * Bar punitive damages against the makers of drugs , vaccines and medical devices that have been tested and approved by the Food and Drug Administration and airplanes that have been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration . While the injured could still win damages to cover their medical_bills and their suffering , they could not get punitive damages unless the product-makers deceived federal regulators . * Reduce damage awards if the injured person misused the product or altered it in a significant way . * Prohibit lawsuits in which the plaintiff ' s use of alcohol or illegal drugs caused an accident or an injury . Proponents of the bill say it would help U.S. manufacturers by establishing a uniform federal law on liability . &quot; If you are making a product now that is sold in the 50 states , you have to deal with 50 different sets of laws , &quot; said William Fay , executive_director of the Product Liability Coordinating Committee . But the initial Republican proposal , even if it becomes law , would not necessarily affect most civil lawsuits that do not involve products . For example , the suits involving sexual_harassment at the San Francisco law_firm and at the Tailhook Assn . convention arose under state law and would not be affected by the proposed federal restrictions . However , leaders of the business coalition say they hope the federal proposals will be adopted by many states . The biggest fights are likely to focus_on limiting punitive damages . Until the 1970s , it was generally understood that the criminal-justice system meted_out punishment and civil lawsuits compensated the injured for damage or losses . But these days , big-time punishment usually comes from angry juries in civil cases . Critics of this trend say punitive damages have at least three drawbacks . First , those being punished often did not cause the damage . Certainly officials of the Hilton Hotels Corp . did not molest Paula Coughlin , the former Navy lieutenant who was assaulted at the Tailhook convention . &quot; That kind of verdict suggests there is something very wrong with the legal_system , &quot; said Yale_University law professor George Priest . &quot; Obviously , everyone feels badly for her , but why should the hotel be held responsible ? Not the officers ? Not the Navy ? It doesn ' t make sense. &quot; Second , the winners often get an undeserved windfall . Jurors in the San Francisco case were told that several women were harassed by attorney Martin Greenstein . They handed_down a $ 50 # 000 compensatory verdict in favor of Rena Weeks , who worked for Greenstein for 25 days . Then they added_on the $ 6.9-million punitive verdict , which Weeks and her lawyers will share . Third , the punishment in civil cases depends entirely on the whim of the jury , unlike the criminal-justice system where penalties are spelled_out in law . Typically , plaintiff ' s lawyers ask the jury to &quot; send a message &quot; to a corporation by handing_down a large monetary award . Both critics and defenders of punitive damages agree that a multimillion-dollar verdict is akin to a lightning bolt -- spectacular but rare . They disagree , however , on whether these lightning bolts send a valuable warning to potential wrongdoers or instead force corporations to pay exorbitant settlements to ward_off outrageous jury verdicts . The president of the Assn . of Trial_Lawyers of America says civil lawsuits against corporations and the threat of big punitive damages have given &quot; Americans the safest workplace and the safest environment &quot; among the industrialized nations . &quot; If you take the deterrent effect ( of punitive damages ) , it lets the bottom-line mentality predominate , &quot; said Larry Stewart , a trial_attorney in Miami . &quot; The American people want to see the wrongdoers held accountable. &quot; But some critics say a growing number of verdicts are outrageously high and go_far beyond any clear sense of punishment for wrongdoing . For example , between January and September of this year , juries in Alabama handed_down 11 separate multimillion-dollar punitive-damage verdicts , many of them against insurance_companies because an agent -- or someone posing as a company agent -- used deception in selling a policy . In one instance , an agent for the Prudential Insurance Co . greatly overstated the value of an annuity policy that a couple purchased for their retirement . When the company learned about the agent ' s deception , it offered to return all_the premiums , but the couple sued . On April 6 , a jury in rural Barbour County awarded them $ 430 # 000 in compensatory damages and $ 25 million in punitive damages . Another couple , whose $ 12 # 000 premium payment was stolen by an agent , won $ 800 # 000 in compensatory damages and $ 24.9 million from the Northwestern Mutual Life_Insurance Co . In both cases , the trial_judge upheld the verdicts . Another suit against BMW , the German auto_maker , gives new meaning to the old pitch of getting &quot; cash back &quot; with an automobile purchase . A doctor who bought a new BMW in 1990 was dismayed to later discover that his car had been damaged slightly during shipping from Germany . The company spent $ 600 to refinish the car but did not inform him because the problem was minor . He sued and won $ 4 # 000 in compensatory damages and $ 2 million in punitive damages , which were upheld by the state Supreme Court in August . &quot; The system is totally out of control in Alabama , &quot; Priest said . In fact , the Legislature once enacted a $ 250 # 000 limit on punitive damages , but it was struck_down by the elected judges of the state ' s high_court . Although Alabama was once the bastion of the states-rights movement , its newspapers have been proclaiming that the &quot; legal lottery &quot; there now &quot; requires federal reform. &quot;</TEXT>
