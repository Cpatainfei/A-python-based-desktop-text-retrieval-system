   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; THE MYTHICALLY RICH ARE EXPOSED ; IN A COUNTRY OF DIRE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE , IT IS IMMORAL THAT 24 FAMILIES HOLD WEALTH EQUAL TO THE NATIONAL BUDGET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When 24 Mexican families are together worth $ 44.1 billion , the news transcends the ordinary to become a genuine moral scandal . How else can we read the Forbes 500 list revealing that , in a country where 17 million people live under conditions of extreme poverty and 35 million are officially considered poor , 24 individuals or families have an accumulated wealth equivalent_to Mexico ' s 1990 national budget ? At the top of the list , published last week , is banker Carlos Slim with $ 6.6 billion and media / communications mogul Emilio Azcarraga with $ 5.4 billion . According to Forbes , Slim had $ 2.1 billion in 1992 . In only two years , he has become the fourth-richest man in the world . His wealth derives in part from his stock in Telefonos de Mexico . It helps , too , that he is in command of 22 % of the Mexican stock_market ' s trading capital . Azcarraga is the major stockholder of Televisa , a corporation blessed by a holy alliance with the government . Beyond the articles , caricatures and mocking references printed in the Mexican press , the Forbes list is monopolizing conversations in Mexico_City . How was this monstrous sum_of_money produced ? The explanation is always the same : The outrageous accumulation of money was facilitated by connections with the government , the clever maneuvering of CEOs , juicy favorable contracts with the governing elites , speculative trading in the stock_market , the ridiculously low buying prices for state-owned businesses , clever tax filing and advantageous associations with foreign capital . Yet , understanding how the vast amount_of_money was accumulated by so few does not dissipate the anger of the majority . In the 1940s and ' 50s , quick fortunes created some sort of communal pride . There were protests and criticism against corruption , but there were also jokes and gossip that entertained the masses -- talk_about the mansions in Acapulco , the safaris to Africa and outrageous gifts to glamorous lovers . Predictably or strangely , the gossip amused a population always dreaming of somehow making_it with one stroke of good_fortune . The multimillionaires of years ago were mocked with jealous admiration and their squanderings became fairy tales . Stories also were told of bureaucrats who found suitcases full of money on the streets and of high government officials winning the lottery 10 times in a row . Corruption was looked_upon as a carnival , something somehow festive . Moral outrage was tempered by a society that accepted and enjoyed the fashionable notion of getting rich quickly and mysteriously . During the 1980s , this fascination with wealth faded as social mobility virtually ceased to exist . One impression seemed to dominate : He who comes from the underclass can only make_it to the starting_point . Fortunes became institutionalized . From now on , there will be only a_few , perhaps none , who will be able to found dynasties . Only the chosen heirs , that ubiquitous species . When capitalism goes wild , there is no room for moral dilemmas . After all , it is not capitalism ' s fault if there is economic inequality . Disparity gives the people an incentive to prosper , and neither compassion nor government handouts serve any purpose . Furthermore , complaining about the rich is a waste_of_time . Forbes ' revelations give testimony to the truths spoken by the majority . Even though what should incite outrage is the number of poor people , somehow invisible despite their demographic majority , it is the number of super-rich in Mexico that creates a reaction , one that irritates , exasperates and causes resentment . Moral indignation tends to be ephemeral and consume itself , but this time the anger remains ever present because the concentrated fortunes continue to grow . The consequences of anger and resentment will not necessarily be demonstrated electorally , but they will be felt in the long_run . In Mexico ' s current economic_condition , so_much concentrated wealth is a personal affront that a devalued middle_class uses to measure its own situation . What opportunities are available for them and their children compared to the 24 richest families and the next richest 100 ? Their destiny seems fixed and stationary , a conclusion derived mainly through observations about the richest people , not the poor . If the class_struggle has been outdated with the fall of communism , then the personal and social experiences of those who have little or no money no longer lead to the usual lamentations addressed against those who own a lot . The awareness of having been radically plundered , of being cut_out of real opportunities without a visible chance of social mobility , is more_than a provocation ; it raises politics to the domain of morality . Meanwhile , the richest people do pay something for their tremendous advantages . They live_in fear , in medieval-like fortresses , with armies of bodyguards , traveling in bulletproof limousines that cost , they say , half a_million dollars and are imported used , from Colombia , because Mercedes-Benz is slow keeping_up with the demand . The sweet honey of the beehive has its price . If kidnaped banker Alfredo Harp Helu ' s ransom was $ 30 million , how much will the next one be worth ?</TEXT>
