   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Job Security ? It ' s Just an Illusion , &quot; Commentary , Sept . 19 : In criticizing the doctrine of &quot; at-will employment , &quot; Reginald Alleyne frequently mentions that employment at will is dead in other industrialized nations . By this , one can assume he means primarily the European Union . What he does not mention is that unemployment in the EU averages over 11 % of the work_force , as opposed to 6 % here . Most economists agree that one of the reasons for the fact that , even during a recession , U.S. unemployment levels never approach European levels is the flexibility of American labor laws , specifically the facility with which employers can hire and fire workers . Changing our employment system , a system that has consistently given us the lowest unemployment in the Western World seems nothing short of insane . JERRY BOURBON San Diego</TEXT>
