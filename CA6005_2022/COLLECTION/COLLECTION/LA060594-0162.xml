   <HEADLINE> UNHERALDED VETERANS FOUND IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Col . Ike Austin , &quot; champion rifle_shot of the world , &quot; astonished Australian audiences in the 1880s with his William Tell act , shooting apples off his wife ' s head and potatoes out of her mouth . Then his aim got shaky and his wife walked_out . He fell_into poverty and died , just another unheralded American who had fought in the Civil War . Unheralded , that is , until Roy Parker , a retired U.S. Air_Force major , and colleagues in the private American Civil War Research Group found his unmarked grave in a Sydney cemetery under his true name , Isaac Putnam Smith . They honored him with a headstone supplied by the U.S. Department of Veterans ' Affairs . Hundreds of American veterans came_to Australia after the Civil War , to seek their fortunes in the gold fields , because the Confederacy lost , or because they were fleeing either the law or bad marriages . Parker and his friends , driven by a fascination with history and compassion for the forgotten veterans , started tracking them down 14 years ago . When the quest began , only three graves of Civil War veterans had been identified in Australia . Parker ' s group has found 90 more and obtained 30 plaques and tombstones from the U.S._government for those that were unmarked . The most colorful of all was Smith , a sergeant in Company G , 84th New York Infantry ( 14th Brooklyn ) , who was an expert rifle_shot . Adopting the stage_names , and rank , of Wild Ike and Col . Ike Austin , Smith earned the great sum of 100 pounds a week performing with the St . Leon Circus , Later , he leased a pavilion at the Bondi Beach aquarium , where his stray shots would vanish over the Pacific . &quot; Col . Ike Austin , the American marksman , is at present shooting potatoes out of his wife ' s mouth and driving tacks into a board , &quot; the Bulletin magazine of Sydney reported in March , 1889 . &quot; Any drinking gentleman who wants the pimples shot off his countenance and his hair cut with ammunition at 50 yards range will please apply to the colonel at once. &quot; Wild Ike wowed crowds in Australia , England , Europe , India , Shanghai and Hong Kong , performing such feats as knocking the ash from a cigar held_in a companion ' s mouth , piercing a deck of cards held_in a bystander ' s hand and snuffing_out lighted candles . Ike ' s aim finally failed , his wife left and his fame faded . He spent his last 10 years in a nursing_home for the poor and went_to a pauper ' s grave . Parker and his friends found their way to Smith ' s grave through word-of-mouth tales , obituaries after his death in 1908 and an 1899 U.S._government pension list . He now has a tombstone of Alabama marble and a place of honor in Rookwood Cemetery . George Johnston Fairweather , of the 4th Maine and later the 19th Maine , survived the fiercest battles of the Civil War only to die in Australia , also in 1908 , as a lonely bachelor . &quot; This poor old_man , they found him dying in a hut near Bowral &quot; southwest of Sydney , Parker said . &quot; The constable came_out in the middle of a winter ' s night , in the wind and rain , and picked him up and took him by wagon 24 kilometers to the Bowral hospital , where he died of pneumonia . &quot; He had nothing on him but a letter to the U.S. consul , &quot; Parker said . &quot; The letter said he had been in the Civil War , mentioned all_the battles and men in his regiment , and he was wondering about his pension. &quot; Fairweather survived the First Battle of Bull_Run , the siege of Williamsburg , Second Bull_Run , Antietam , Fredericksburg , Gettysburg , the Wilderness and half_a_dozen lesser engagements . In the end , Parker said , &quot; The poor old guy , he had no friends or anything. &quot; Anyone who has information about Mexican_War or Civil War veterans who went_to Australia can reach Roy Parker at 41 Churchill Road , East Killara , New South Wales , Australia 2071 .</TEXT>
