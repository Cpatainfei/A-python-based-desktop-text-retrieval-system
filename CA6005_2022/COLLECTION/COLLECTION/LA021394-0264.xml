   <HEADLINE> JAPAN SEEKS TO STAVE OFF TRADE CURBS ; DIPLOMACY : HOSOKAWA THINKS BREAKDOWN OF TALKS WILL NOT LEAD TO IMMEDIATE U.S. SANCTIONS . HE SUGGESTS MEASURES WOULD BE ILLEGAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Saturday sought to stave_off American retaliation against Japanese products following the breakdown in trade talks between the two countries . &quot; I don ' t think he ( President Clinton ) will be thinking immediately about sanctions , &quot; Hosokawa told a news_conference here shortly before departing for Tokyo . &quot; I don ' t think the failure of an agreement will lead immediately to sanctions. &quot; His remarks reflected a last-ditch hope that the Clinton_Administration , in its unhappiness with Japan ' s trade_policies , will confine itself to rhetoric and will not take concrete actions to restrict Japanese exports to the United States . That possibility appears remote . After Clinton and Hosokawa failed to resolve their differences at a three-hour meeting at the White_House on Friday , a senior Administration official told reporters , &quot; The reality is , we ' ll take some action. &quot; On Saturday , Hosokawa suggested that Japan might try to argue that new American trade sanctions would be illegal . &quot; I very much hope that the United States will refrain_from resorting_to unilateral actions that would be in contravention &quot; of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the Japanese prime_minister declared . He was referring to international trade laws that prevent one country from acting_on its own to limit goods from another nation . Under December ' s GATT agreement , a new_World Trade Organization will run what Japan hopes will be an effective panel for resolving disputes . After the latest round of trade talks broke_down , U.S. officials immediately began discussing the possible revival of a trade provision known as Super 301 , which would permit U.S. retaliation against specific industries within a country if that nation is found to be violating existing trade agreements . That section of American trade law was particularly disliked by Japan because it required an annual review of trade_barriers abroad and mandated U.S. retaliation if the barriers were not lifted . The law expired in 1990 , but Clinton could reimpose it on_his_own with an executive order , or he could support legislation proposed by Sen . John D . ( Jay ) Rockefeller IV ( D-W.Va. ) and House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) that would do the same thing . The American position is that trade restrictions imposed under Super 301 do not violate GATT because they are in retaliation for another country ' s limits on American products overseas . In addition , the Clinton_Administration argues that it reserved the right to impose these trade restrictions in Tokyo last summer when it adopted a broad &quot; framework agreement &quot; aimed at reducing the $ 60-billion-a-year trade imbalance between the two countries . The dispute between the two major trading partners is over how to reduce Japan ' s trade surplus in four economic sectors -- autos and auto parts , medical equipment , telecommunications_equipment and insurance . Clinton and Hosokawa ' s predecessor , Kiichi Miyazawa , agreed in Tokyo last July that they would establish a framework for setting &quot; objective criteria &quot; by which progress in reducing the trade surplus could be measured . At the White_House on Friday , the President and the Japanese prime_minister told reporters that there needs to be a &quot; cooling-off period &quot; before the two countries try again to resolve their deep differences . But at Saturday ' s news_conference , Hosokawa , whose public support in Japan has been plummeting , suggested he might like to try to negotiate again soon . Still , he showed no flexibility on what Japanese officials insist is a fundamental disagreement between the two governments over how to judge progress in redressing the trade imbalance . The Clinton_Administration has pushed for objective standards in judging whether Japan ' s markets are opened or closed . U.S. officials say they want to use hard data , like comparing the percentage of sales in Japan that go_to imports with the comparable percentages in other industrialized countries . Japan has responded by saying that this approach would amount to &quot; numerical targets &quot; and would be &quot; managed trade , &quot; in violation of free-market principles . Clinton contended Friday that he is not seeking fixed numerical targets and is willing to temper the use of percentages by taking_into_account such factors as exchange_rates and changes in domestic demand . Hosokawa on Saturday rejected Clinton ' s explanation . &quot; Some of the objective criteria that the U.S. side sought -- they used various words to express them -- we feel were the same as numerical targets , &quot; he said . &quot; And we feel that this runs counter to the deregulation that we , the Hosokawa administration , have taken as its basic principles. &quot; Managed trade , he said , &quot; is something that we must avoid at all costs . That is our basic position . Therefore , we will not modify our position. &quot; In Tokyo , Hosokawa ' s actions won wide support . &quot; No matter what , &quot; said Gaishi Hiraiwa , head of the Keidanren , the country ' s leading business group , &quot; Japan cannot accept America ' s effort to bring_about managed trade. &quot; Yohei Kono , leader of the opposition Liberal Democrats , also lent support to the prime_minister . &quot; For Hosokawa to reject the American proposal was simply common_sense , &quot; he said today . At the news_conference , Hosokawa also hinted that Japan may_not be able to go_along with proposals for economic sanctions against North_Korea if these sanctions require Japan to impose strict limits on the money sent home by North_Koreans living_in Japan . American officials have suggested that cutting_off these &quot; remittances &quot; from Japan to North_Korea could be one of the ways used to pressure Pyongyang to give_up a nuclear_weapons program . North_Korea warned Saturday that any economic sanctions would amount to a declaration of war . Hosokawa told Clinton that Japan will support sanctions against North_Korea &quot; to the extent permitted by Japanese law. &quot;</TEXT>
