   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : A PUBLIC FORUM FOR A PRIVATE HORROR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The paradox of offensive public art is a rich one . You put_up a provocative sculpture -- say , the figure of a woman who has apparently just been raped with the two rapists suspended eerily above her , dangling by the offending parts of their anatomies -- then sit_back and hope it causes a ruckus . You want people not to want it . You want them to demonstrate , to demand it be removed , to scream and yell that it might belong in a museum , but it certainly doesn ' t belong here . And you want people to want it . You want them to counterdemonstrate , to scream and yell that if we are to address the issues raised by the piece -- say , the vile nature of the crime of rape -- then we must_not hide from the ugliness of the act . Then , I guess , you sit_back and see how many reporters and TV news cameras show_up . It ' s rather like baiting a trap . Which is why Peg Yorkin , of the Feminist Majority Foundation , and the money behind this particular piece of public art , sounded anything but upset on Friday , the day after a crowd of about 60 turned_out at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and 15th Street in Santa Monica to debate the work . &quot; Listen , &quot; Yorkin said . &quot; I ' m glad . The whole purposes was to start a discussion about rape. &quot; Mission accomplished . * I stood on the corner last week , listening to some of the debate . No one was defending rape . Most of the acrimony centered_on whether the sculpture , &quot; Morality / Mortality , &quot; by artist Ed Massey , belonged on a public corner , visible to any passersby , including children . There is a middle_school a block away , but this is hardly_a corner where children play . Those who defended the presence of the sculpture seemed inclined to discuss the impact of rape on women and the importance of imparting this message to boys . Some women who identified themselves as rape survivors had taped moving handwritten messages to the plate_glass . Those who opposed it suggested that it would be more appropriately placed in a museum or gallery , away from the inquisitive gazes of children . And where almost no one , I dare say , would see it . It seems to me that the sculpture offers parents -- particularly the parents of older_boys -- something valuable . Sex is an awkward subject , especially for adolescents , and for that reason , sex educators often tell parents to be alert for &quot; teachable moments , &quot; times when the issue can be broached in a natural , non-threatening way . A child ' s reaction -- horror , disgust , fright or mere curiosity -- can be turned_into a rational discussion of a particularly terrifying and prevalent crime . The sculpture and discussions of sexual violence are obviously not appropriate for small children , but the smaller ones will surely not be wandering down Wilshire by themselves . Adults with tykes in tow can hurry them past or cross the street . A moment ' s exposure will not produce a trauma . As Yorkin points_out : &quot; This cannot be more violent than what kids see on television . And what they see in movies is far worse than this. &quot; Not to mention violence-drenched video_games . There ' s a lesson here for older children , no matter how unpalatable . It ' s up_to parents , though , to take_advantage of it . Show me something similarly redeeming in the horror films so loved by middle_school kids . And I ' ll show you &quot; Freddy Krueger ' s Enchanted April. &quot; * I wonder about parents who turn_out in droves to protest a brutally honest piece of art about rape , while barely blinking at the barrage of messages -- in ads , in music videos , in movies -- that impart to children the notion that women are good for only one thing . Drive along Sunset Boulevard , and you can ' t miss the huge billboards of a certain clothing company featuring women in various states of undress and sexual readiness . Open any fashion magazine and see the extraordinarily sexual content of most of the ads . The March issue of Vogue features a photo of a nude woman on a pedestal . Her eyes are closed , one hand covers her groin , the other holds a purse . It ' s a handbag ad . On another page , a sneaker ad shows a boy kissing the shoe of a young_woman and this caption : &quot; He tried_for her lips , but she suggested he go much lower. &quot; Wanton female sexuality permeates the culture . Most of it is imaginary , of course , but a girl flipping though a fashion magazine may have a struggle separating fantasy notions of womanhood from reality . How do we counteract this message for both boys and girls ? I respect parents who want to protect their children from the terrible things that happen around us every day , and I don ' t think they are prudes for not wanting to expose their children to this sculpture . But the fact is , it ' s there . Unlike rape , though , it ' s going_away soon . * Robin Abcarian ' s column is published Wednesdays and Sundays .</TEXT>
