   <HEADLINE> HEAVY RAINS DRENCH VALLEYS ; ANOTHER STORM IS EXPECTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The tail_end of what one weather_forecaster referred to as a &quot; mother lode &quot; storm system brought more heavy rain to parts of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys Wednesday . The rain_gauge maintained by the National Weather Service in Santa Clarita registered a half-inch accumulation of rain by evening , with more expected later that night , said meteorologist Bruce Entwistle . The rain was especially heavy in Santa Clarita , with 0.3 of an inch coming_down in just one hour , starting at 4:10 p.m. , he said . Heavy rain and thunderstorms were also reported in Tujunga and several other northeast San Fernando Valley areas . And although this system -- which in three days has brought rain , hail , thunderstorms and even snow to Southern California cities -- is finally leaving the Los Angeles Basin , more bad_weather is probably ahead . &quot; There is another storm system heading this way , and there is a chance that by late Saturday night , there could be more rain , &quot; said Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , which provides weather information to The Times . This system spun_off from a powerful low_pressure center near the Aleutian Islands , Thoren said . But for the next three days at least , while the sun ' s appearance may be spotty , there is no rain in the forecast . Skies should be partly cloudy today , as the storm gives_way to a strong high_pressure system about 100 miles off the coast . This kind of system provides the sunny days more common for this time_of_year , Entwistle said . The recent rains were unusual in that they drenched some areas of the San Fernan d o Valley while letting others off far more easily . Woodland Hills in the West Valley accumulated about one inch of rain over the last three days . While rainfall totals aren ' t available for communities to the east , Entwistle estimated that they received from one-third to one-half of an inch of rain . Even with the dwindling storm system Wednesday , there were reports of rough weather in other parts of the county . A helicopter pilot reported seeing a funnel cloud associated with a thunderstorm moving north over East Los Angeles about 4 p.m. , Thoren said .</TEXT>
