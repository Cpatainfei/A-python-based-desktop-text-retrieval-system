   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; COLLATERAL SALES REVEAL MURKINESS OF BANKRUPTCY LAW ; FINANCE : CHAPTER 9 , LARGELY UNTESTED UNTIL NOW , IS SUPPOSED TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO . BUT A 1984 AMENDMENT EXEMPTS ' REVERSE REPOS , ' WHICH ORANGE COUNTY FUND USED , IN CORPORATE CASES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cash is gone . The judge is out of town . The county isn ' t saying much . Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code was supposed to provide an orderly shelter for financially beleaguered municipalities such_as Orange County . But in its first real test , some experts think the law has been found wanting . The purpose of a bankruptcy is to preserve the status_quo and permit a reasonable resolution of massive financial problems . But Orange County ' s status_quo was badly shaken by Wall_Street ' s liquidation of $ 11.4 billion of the county ' s bond holdings this week . Now the county &quot; has to try to unscramble the omelet , &quot; said Loyola University law professor Daniel Schechter . Scrambled is a good_word to describe the legal picture as Orange County ends its first week in bankruptcy protection . Several legal_experts said the outcome of the county ' s gamble on a Chapter 9 filing is far from clear , because there really are no precedents . The collateral calls by Wall_Street -- in which investment houses sold bonds they held to cover the county ' s unpaid loans -- are just one indication of the lack of clarity . Since the law is so murky , some legal analysts were surprised that Orange County had not asked a bankruptcy judge for an injunction specifically barring such liquidation sales , rather than simply relying_on the normal &quot; stay &quot; provisions of the bankruptcy law . Instead , the county Friday sued Nomura Securities -- one of the brokerages that sold its collateral -- and pledged to sue others as it gathers sufficient data . &quot; Because there are always questions &quot; about the scope of a bankruptcy ' s automatic stay provisions , &quot; it ' s not uncommon for the debtor to ask the judge for an additional injunction , &quot; said University of Texas law professor Jay Westbrook . Bruce S . Bennett , Orange County ' s lead bankruptcy lawyer , said he could not comment on this issue without divulging confidential attorney-client discussions . He also declined comment when asked whether there are problems with the operation of Chapter 9 . Bennett said the county is moving_on a number of legal fronts beyond court actions . &quot; The court proceedings are important , but not necessarily the most important thing , &quot; Bennett said in an interview . &quot; My objective for this case is to find practical solutions to the problems and have them implemented with a minimum of discord , &quot; he said . &quot; What ' s happening outside the courtroom is very often more important than what is going_on in the courtroom. &quot; In a statement , Nomura declared that the county ' s suit was &quot; baseless and without merit , &quot; and pledged to defend itself &quot; vigorously. &quot; And a lawyer representing a New York investment bank that liquidated millions in bonds Thursday said Wall_Street firms have studied the_matter and are &quot; confident we will prevail on the legal issues. &quot; Westbrook and Schechter said two fundamental public policy issues appear to be at war in the current situation . On the one hand , the purpose of allowing a debtor to file for bankruptcy is to freeze the status_quo so there can be an orderly disposition of conflicting claims . * On the other hand , the bankruptcy law was specifically amended in 1984 to make repurchase agreements on government_bonds and certain other instruments -- popularly known as reverse repos -- exempt from the law ' s coverage in corporate bankruptcies . The law was amended at Wall_Street ' s behest after industry lobbyists convinced Congress that this exemption was needed to aid the free flow of capital , said Omaha bankruptcy lawyer Harry Dixon , former counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee . When Congress exempted repurchase agreements from the coverage of corporate bankruptcy law , &quot; who would have thought that a county would be dabbling_in reverse repos , &quot; Dixon said . It was reverse-repo transactions that allowed Orange County to boost its investment portfolio to almost triple the sum invested by local agencies -- and that caused the fund to deflate as interest_rates rose and the bond holdings ' value fell . Houston bankruptcy lawyer Hugh Ray , head of the American Bar Assn. ' s business bankruptcy committee , said that the controversy will not have a quick solution and that the battle could go all_the way to the U.S. Supreme Court . Westbrook warned that without strict limits on creditors ' actions once a bankruptcy is filed , the supposed protection of the court is of limited value . &quot; To the extent that certain types of transactions are exempted from the automatic stay , the whole idea of bankruptcy becomes problematic , &quot; he said . &quot; This exemption swallows an awful lot of the law . Some of the most important benefits are lost by these exemptions. &quot; All that appears clear at present is that there may be a bonanza for lawyers , because there are disputes on even the simplest of concepts . For example , what does_it mean to &quot; preserve the status_quo &quot; in a situation like this ? Robert J . Rosenberg , a prominent New York City bankruptcy lawyer , said that if the brokerages had not acted , the status_quo would have been unalterably changed for them because the crisis was driving down the value of their holdings . &quot; If sales are frozen , that shifts the risk of the future ups and downs of the securities from the county to the house holding the security , &quot; Rosenberg said . But Schechter said the basic purpose of Chapter 9 clearly was to prevent the sort of fire_sales that occurred Thursday . If they are permitted to stand , he said , that would significantly erode the power of Chapter 9 as a meaningful tool to protect financially troubled governmental entities . &quot; In the context of a municipality , it ' s not all_clear to me from a policy standpoint that the liquidity of the markets is of paramount concern , &quot; Schechter said . &quot; It ' s really a juxtaposition of three strange worlds colliding at one small point in Orange County -- municipal insolvency , liquidity of the securities market and the specialized world of leveraged securities transactions. &quot; * There are a host of other unanswered questions -- including whether the bankruptcy filing was a massive miscalculation . After all , it may have precipitated Thursday ' s sales , which seem to have further endangered Orange County ' s position . Bennett said people leveling this contention are not aware of all_the relevant facts . But he declined to elaborate . The situation is so uncharted that Orange County filed two separate bankruptcies , one on behalf of the county and one on behalf of the investment fund . Legal experts said it is possible that the county decided to take two bites at the apple to hedge its bets . If federal bankruptcy Judge John Ryan concludes the county is not insolvent , he could throw_out its filing . If he concludes the fund itself does not qualify as a debtor under Chapter 9 , he could throw_out its filing . The county ' s hope may be that at least one filing survives . Bennett declined to respond to that premise . Ryan , in Santa Ana , who will return from vacation next week to take the reins_in the case , is likely to be making new law in a series of rulings in coming months . But while Ryan has a pivotal role , he does not have as much power as a judge in a corporate bankruptcy , according to legal_experts . Under Chapter 9 , the judge is empowered to review the county ' s plan to reorder its affairs , known formally as &quot; a plan of adjustment. &quot; If he finds the plan unfair , he can reject it . If that happens , the county can modify the plan . But the judge does not have the power to tell the county that it can no longer buy or sell certain kinds of securities . Nor can he take_over the operations of Orange County or take other actions the way a judge can in a corporate bankruptcy by appointing a trustee . It also is unclear how rapidly the Orange County proceeding will unfold . Thus far , no hearings have been scheduled and there are no deadlines for the filing of any legal papers . On Friday , Bennett said it was unclear when the first court hearing would be held and how significant the first hearing would be when it is held . In coming weeks , Orange County will be submitting to the court a list of its creditors and how much they are owed . Then the county will be required to prepare its plan of adjustment in consultation with the creditors , particularly the larger ones . Historically , most municipal bankruptcies have been resolved quickly . But none has been remotely as large as this one . The biggest previous municipal bankruptcy filing was lodged_in 1991 by Bridgeport , Conn. , which had more_than $ 200 million in bond debt , a mere fraction of Orange County ' s current debt . Bridgeport ' s bankruptcy was dismissed because the county was found to be solvent . Some skeptics already have raised doubt about whether Orange County is insolvent . For an entity to be a Chapter 9 debtor , the law provides that it must be insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and that it must desire to effect a plan to adjust its debts . Since Orange County has been meeting its payroll obligations and paying its debts to suppliers , Westbrook said there is a question as_to whether it is insolvent . Moreover , he said that if the county starts to have problems paying debts , the question arises as_to whether the county should be obligated to raise taxes rather than resorting_to bankruptcy . But Schechter said that if the county does not qualify as a debtor , it will become even more difficult to achieve an &quot; orderly untangling of this mess. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Filing for Bankruptcy Local_governments overwhelmed by debts can seek protection by filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code . Approval of a Chapter 9 petition rests heavily on the filer ' s solvency , its creditors ' approval and creation of a viable plan for paying debts . A federal bankruptcy judge makes the final_decision . Here are the steps involved : 1 ) Bankruptcy petition is filed . 2 ) Government_agency files a list of creditors . 3 ) A creditors ' committee is formed . There will be several such committees . The judge can rule committees are not needed . 4 ) Creditors file claims . A deadline for filing will be set by the judge . 5 ) A plan of reorganization takes_shape as the petitioner negotiates with creditor groups . 6 ) The petitioner publishes a plan of reorganization . The plan will classify types of creditors . 7 ) The court approves a disclosure document describing the reorganization proposal and the agency ' s financial_condition . 8 ) Creditors vote whether to support the plan no sooner than 20 days -- usually a month -- later . For approval , the plan needs a two-thirds majority of the creditors ( in monetary amount ) and a simple majority in number ( to protect the small creditors ) , determined by the number of creditors who actually vote . 9 ) Judge reviews plan for fairness and can approve or reject it . If rejected , the agency can modify the plan and resubmit . Source : Times staff reports Who Files Chapter 9 filings , 1980-94 .
