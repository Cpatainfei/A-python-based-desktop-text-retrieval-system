   <TEXT> Although Simi Valley High will not get its proposed air-supported dome as a temporary home for its basketball and wrestling teams , plans for repair of the school ' s earthquake-damaged gym have accelerated this week . Repairs are now expected to be completed by Sept . 1 , 1995 , said Lowell Schultze , director of information services for the Simi Valley Unified School District . On Tuesday , about a week after the temporary dome plans were rejected by the state architect ' s office , the district received word that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had approved plans to go_ahead with repair of the school ' s gym and a multipurpose room , used for the band and other large groups . The Pioneer basketball and wrestling teams will continue to practice at various off-campus sites , including the Apollo continuation school and at a gym at the Rancho Santa Susana Park . Games will be held primarily at Royal High , with some at Moorpark College or Apollo . The school proposed a dome containing basketball_courts and room for spectators , but the state architect ' s office rejected plans for a dome of that size because there was no code for such a building on school grounds , Schultze said . The building would have been similar to one constructed at Alemany High . Schultze said Alemany did not need approval from the state architect ' s office because it is a private_school .</TEXT>
