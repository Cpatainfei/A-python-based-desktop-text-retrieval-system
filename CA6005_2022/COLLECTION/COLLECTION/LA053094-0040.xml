   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : UTILITIES ' BEATING POINTS_UP COMMON RISK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Utility funds are suffering through one of their worst stretches since the 1970s , but the pain hasn ' t been evenly distributed . Portfolios filled mostly with electric stocks , once synonymous with widows-and-orphans safety , have borne the brunt of the decline , while other utility investments , namely the telephone stocks , have held_up better . The whole episode underscores the importance of knowing what a particular fund holds , as the stereotypes once associated with utility funds crumble . It also points_up the dangers of risking too_much on any one industry , even one perceived to be stable . A lot of people who sank money into utility funds between 1991 and 1993 , when the group ' s combined assets swelled from $ 11.4 billion to $ 30.3 billion , probably expected fairly low volatility and generous dividend yields . And the funds , anchored by their electric holdings , had mostly delivered them . But electric stocks have gone_into a tailspin over the past eight months . Some utility funds with a heavy focus in this area are down 15 % to 20 % , including dividend income , over that stretch . And all_of a sudden , critics are talking_about long-lasting structural changes in the business . It ' s possible utility funds , like bond portfolios , simply took a beating from the sudden reversal in interest_rates that started last fall . If so , stable long-term rates could allow the shares to recover lost ground . Electric utility stocks trade much like bonds because of the large dividends they pay . But a full-fledged rebound might be harder to achieve because of new worries surrounding deregulation . Some feel increased competition in the utility business will crimp earnings for years to come . The 1992 Energy Policy Act created a competitive market for wholesale power , one that big industrial users are increasingly trying to exploit , says Charles B . Carlson , editor of Dow Theory Forecasts , an investment newsletter based in Hammond , Ind . These customers are demanding larger discounts . Downsizing offers a bargaining_chip , as companies threatening to close plants might drive a harder bargain with the local electric_company for lower rates on the ones that remain open . Another threatening aspect is &quot; retail wheeling , &quot; which would give any power generators access to a utility ' s transmission network , for a fee . Customers could then buy electricity from entities other_than their local utility . Though not yet widespread , it could wreak havoc by making local demand hard to predict , Carlson says . Of course , lower-cost utilities and those with excess capacity could benefit from deregulation , so the outlook would n ' t be universally bleak . The telecommunications business provides an example of a deregulated industry that has thrived with competition . So for investors , the relevant question is whether the bad news associated with deregulation is already reflected in the lower prices for electric stocks . Some advisers think so . Utility &quot; stocks have been the victim of bad press due_to the growing competition in the industry , &quot; says Fund Profit Alert , a Cincinnati newsletter . &quot; We expect that this well-publicized growing competition has been more_than factored into current utility share prices. &quot; As positives , energy costs and utility borrowing expenses remain under_control , the latter helped by the refinancing of debt at low interest_rates . Also , some observers believe that deregulation in the electricity business could be less disruptive than in other industries . And for contrarian investors willing to take some chances , the 5 % to 6 % yields available on some utility funds are certainly tempting , though it ' s worth noting that dividends could be cut_in the face of deregulatory pressures . For some of the more widely diversified utility portfolios , the recent ride has been much less bumpy . While nearly all utility funds have lost ground in 1994 , the telecommunications-driven portfolios haven ' t dropped as much , and a_few funds with heavier foreign exposure are showing gains . With the proliferation of fax transmissions , cellular_phones , computer transmissions over phone_lines and other high-tech applications , the domestic telephone industry is seen as a long-term growth business . The telephone industry is also viewed_as a growth business abroad , especially in developing economies , where basic communications services are still in great demand -- hence the global reach of many telecommunications funds . Even the third utility leg , natural_gas shares , could offer good potential . Carlson predicts that these companies , which have already gone_through their own bout of deregulation , will outperform electric stocks . Warren Spitz , manager of the $ 4-billion Prudential Utilities Fund , the largest fund in the group , has boosted his natural_gas stake to 30 % of assets , compared to 5 % for other utility funds . In short , utility funds that can move among all three industries may well continue to be the best way to go_for utility investors . Presumably , these people still want the stable performance they long associated with utility shares but which they are no longer getting with electric stocks . * The worst may be over for fixed-income funds , says the chief economist at brokerage Kidder Peabody in New York . &quot; I ' m fairly bullish on long-term bonds , &quot; says Anthony J . Vignola , who thinks yields on 30-year Treasuries could ease to about 7 % by year ' s end from 7.4 % recently . Vignola believes long-term interest_rates have risen too fast since October in_relation_to short-term rates and inflation . While the nation is nearing realistic &quot; full_employment &quot; with about 6 % unemployment , inflation has been reined_in , and the Federal_Reserve_Board has acted early to control it , he says . Also , rising productivity here and weak economies abroad are helping to keep inflation at_bay . Yet short-term bond funds may_not fare so well , says Vignola , who believes the central_bank will continue to tighten credit in the second_half of 1994 . * The Washington-based Investment_Company Institute has unveiled its 1994-95 directory of mutual_funds . The guide provides thumbnail coverage of the 4 # 500 funds that belong_to the national trade organization , including addresses , phone_numbers and minimum investment requirements .

Still Plugged In Some utility funds have held_up reasonably well in the decline that began around Sept . 1 , 1993 . Most have relatively light exposure to electric stocks , which have taken an uncharacteristic pounding from rising interest_rates and deregulation worries . 05 # 22 , 11 # 08 , 08 # 10 Total 12-mo .
