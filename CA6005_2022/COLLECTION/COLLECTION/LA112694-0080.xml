   <HEADLINE> CZECHS TURN_OUT TO BUY INTO INDUSTRY ; PRIVATIZATION : STOCK IN 1 # 849 STATE COMPANIES IS TRANSFERRED . MORE THAN 80 % OF ADULT CITIZENS NOW OWN SHARES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Czech Republic on Friday ended a privatization program with nearly all available shares sold . About a third of the country ' s industry has been transferred to about 6 million investors . The program , unprecedented in the former Soviet bloc , was undertaken to break_up state monopolies and give financially troubled companies new , private management . Although only Czech citizens and investment funds were eligible to buy , the move also opened_doors to foreign capital . Shares from the coupon privatization are now routinely traded on the Prague Stock_Exchange and the computerized RM System . &quot; Free entry and direct access were the main priorities , &quot; Dusan Triska , chief architect of the program , said in an interview . When the program began three years ago , every adult Czech was entitled to buy government-issued coupons for a token fee of 1 # 000 crowns ( $ 35 ) . The coupons were used either to bid individually or through investment funds on shares_in 1 # 849 state-owned companies . On Friday , the government declared an end to the bidding after nearly all shares of the privatized companies were sold . More_than 80 % of the adult population became shareholders . The same scheme was used on a lesser scale in Slovakia before the peaceful breakup of the former Czechoslovak federation , and it is expected to be continued there next year . A news_agency said Friday that Ukrainians whose savings were devalued by inflation would get certificates allowing them to buy shares_in privatized state companies . Czech critics say the ambitious project did not live_up_to all expectations . Most of the coupon-based shares belong_to several large investment funds closely connected to big banks , which have been reluctant to drive the indebted companies they own into restructuring or bankruptcy .</TEXT>
