   <HEADLINE> VANTAGE_POINT ; A PAINTER AND STORYTELLER RELATES HER FATHER ' S CHILDHOOD IN CHINA ; BABA : A RETURN TO CHINA UPON MY FATHER ' S SHOULDERS , BY BELLE YANG ( HARCOURT BRACE : $ 27.95 ; 240 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cover of &quot; Baba &quot; fills your eye with splashes of vibrant color and an explosion of Chinese folk figures and symbols , above which rests the book ' s evocative image of the author perched upon her father ' s shoulders to revisit the events of his childhood . Before you have even opened Belle Yang ' s captivating memoir of a China that now seems so remote , you are hooked . Yang , who emigrated from Taiwan to America as a child in the 1960s , grew_up to become an artist , following in the footsteps of her father ; over the intervening years he entertained her with tales of life in Northeast China of the 1930s and 1940s , a place and time tantalizingly beyond her reach . Wanting to share those memories more intimately and draw closer to her father , she knew she would have &quot; to tap into the original language in which his ideas were given form. &quot; So she went_to China and spent three years studying art at Beijing ' s Academy of Traditional Chinese Painting , learning spoken and written Chinese , and traveling around the vast landscape . Upon her return to America in 1989 , in the wake of the horrors of Tian An Men Square , she was finally able to &quot; ask the questions that would stir ( her father ) enough to carry ( her ) into the past. &quot; Baba is the glorious result of these two interwoven journeys , taken half a century apart . Born the fourth of seven children in a prominent , sprawling family transplanted generations earlier from south of the Great Wall to the Manchurian steppes , Joseph Yang -- Baba -- was submerged in the rituals of traditional Chinese life , with its rigid hierarchies , weighty Confucian morality and collective ethos . In 1931 , when he was 3 years old , the more familiar predators -- bandits , warlords , and a host of fanciful charlatans -- were replaced by the most voracious plunderers of all , the Japanese Imperial forces ; they occupied Manchuria and set_up the puppet state of Manchukuo . Yang ' s text is rich_in humanity , with healers , wastrels , beggars , goblins , family members as perplexing as they are endearing , even a living Buddha ( slightly tarnished ) . The people in these tales occupy themselves with births and deaths and weddings and errant train rides ; with posturing and saving face and making stupid life decisions . These are folk tales grounded securely in reality , ghost stories with human twists and recaptured moments that are often painful to narrator and reader alike . Lavishy illustrated and lovingly narrated , Baba wonderfully evokes the sights , sounds and emotions of a lost childhood . The influence of folk_art on Yang is strikingly obvious in the two_dozen sparkling watercolors that illuminate the text ; yet it is to her credit as a writer that while readers may well come for the wonderful paintings , they will stay for the prose . There are wonderful descriptions , where all share_in the rewards of Yang ' s wordsmithing , even the ugly daughter of a medicine_man with miraculous curative powers : &quot; Daye being rather a progressive thinker ( and having no other choice ) , his hope came_to rest upon his other child -- a daughter . Now , this daughter -- a short , squat , swarthy woman with bulbous eyes and yellow , rat-like teeth that sprouted between her normal adult ones , leaning every which way like disrupted roof tiles -- was so homely , she aroused pity and brought silent condolences to people ' s lips. &quot; Or the depiction of the mysterious , soup-slurping hanger-on who sees the past and the future with equal clarity : &quot; Idiot Yuan wore a silk skullcap atop a spray of long hair that was cut bluntly at the shoulders -- hair so black it absorbed all light . He sniffled and snuffled , fluid always threatening to slide out of his nose and down his stringy beard . His big , bloodshot eyes were shaded by protrusive brow ridges , above which vertical veins , like two purple cords , throbbed . The man was poor in expressions , hanging only one upon his swarthy face : that of a foolish half-smile. &quot; Yang routinely brings such images to life with her ability to choose words as colors and create sentences that flow like brush strokes . The filtering process of the tales -- from father to daughter to reader -- produces a remarkable clarity of vision and insistent narrative continuity ; then each event or theme is captured in crystalline permanence by Yang ' s artwork . Whenever I searched the paintings for something I might have missed ( which was often ) , I was led back to the text from which it emerged : to bottles in the sky ( those curious , and deadly , Japanese bombs ) , or table scraps ( gathered by an aging peasant couple ) , or the &quot; firewagon &quot; ( on which village women take an unanticipated joy ride ) , or a set of four quite different weddings and a funeral. ) . Yang moves effortlessly from the role of mediator of her father ' s memory voice to that of interpreter of contexts and consequences . And she holds_out the promise of a continuation of her father ' s passage through China , for the book ends as he prepares_for a journey south to escape the ruthless search for &quot; enemies of the people &quot; by the newly arrived Communist forces . While waiting to see where Baba goes next , his daughter &quot; riding high upon his shoulders to dream the landscape of China , &quot; the reader can return to the words and pictures of this remarkable book . I know I will .</TEXT>
