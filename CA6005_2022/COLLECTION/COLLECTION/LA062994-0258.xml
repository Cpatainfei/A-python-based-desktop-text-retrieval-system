   <HEADLINE> IRVINE CO . EXEC TO JOIN WILSON ' S REELECTION TEAM ; POLITICS : LARRY THOMAS , AN OLD FRIEND , WILL BE THE SENIOR COUNSELOR AND ' HELP REFINE ' THE CAMPAIGN MESSAGE . TWO OTHER KEY AIDES ADDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson shored_up his campaign team Tuesday by appointing an old friend , Irvine Co . Senior_Vice_President Larry Thomas , as senior counselor to his reelection committee . Thomas ' appointment was part of a campaign restructuring announced by Wilson campaign manager George Gorton that includes two other past and present Wilson staffers . Others named as senior staffers to the governor ' s reelection effort were Kathleen Shanahan , the deputy secretary for economic development of the California Trade and Commerce Agency ; and Marty Wilson , a senior_vice_president and managing director of the Sacramento office of Burson-Marsteller public relations . Shanahan will become the deputy campaign manager overseeing day-to-day operations , and Wilson will serve as a senior counselor focusing_on campaign fund-raising . Thomas , who first worked for Gov . Wilson as his press secretary when Wilson was elected San Diego mayor in 1971 , said he would be leaving the county ' s largest land owner and development firm to &quot; help refine the message and the message delivery &quot; for the Wilson campaign . &quot; In doing so , I will be offering a hand to an old friend who I admire greatly , &quot; Thomas said in a letter announcing his decision to rejoin Wilson . He said in an interview that he had no plans to return to the Irvine Co . after the Nov . 8 general_election . Gorton said in a prepared statement , &quot; As we prepare_for the general_election campaign , I am extremely pleased that we have been able to augment our team with three such outstanding individuals. &quot; Local Republicans saw Thomas ' move as being driven more by his personal_relationship with Wilson and less by the governor ' s need to symbolically reach_out to Orange County , which is counted_on by statewide Republican candidates to give them 2-to-1 vote ratios needed to offset Democratic strongholds in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area . Wilson has had a topsy-turvy relationship with Orange County ' s conservative Republicans , who registered a protest vote against the governor in the June 7 primary by giving his virtually unknown opponent , businessman Ron Unz , almost 43 % of the vote . While Republicans said they expect Wilson to win_back the disaffected voters in November , Thomas ' addition to the campaign team &quot; doesn ' t hurt. &quot; &quot; ( Thomas ) has been here , he ' s active in the county , &quot; said William Buck Johns , a Newport Beach developer and Wilson backer , who added that Thomas can provide overall support to the campaign . &quot; Wilson needs all_the good_guys . You cannot have too many good_guys , and I think Larry is one of the best. &quot; Political research consultant Gary C . Lawrence said Thomas knows Wilson well enough to help explain the governor ' s &quot; vision &quot; to the voters . &quot; Once Wilson explains to the electorate what makes him tick , I think the conservatives are going_to find a lot that they like , &quot; Lawrence said . After serving as Wilson ' s press secretary in San Diego , Thomas worked for Wilson ' s ill-fated 1978 gubernatorial campaign , and then left politics after that election to join the Bechtel Corp . in San Francisco . In 1982 , then-Gov . George Deukmejian appointed him as his press secretary . He ran Deukmejian ' s successful reelection campaign in 1986 . Thomas later became press secretary for Vice_President George_Bush , a job he held for three months before joining the Irvine Co . in 1987 . The development firm itself has close ties to Wilson . In addition to past ties between corporate officers and Wilson , company owner Donald L . Bren is a longtime Wilson backer . The Irvine Co . and Bren together have donated $ 100 # 000 this year to Wilson ' s reelection campaign . Gary H . Hunt , a senior_vice_president for the Irvine Co. , said Thomas ' decision was personal and had nothing to do with Bren ' s support for Wilson . &quot; Larry has been a tremendous resource for the company in the community and he ' s going_to be sorely missed , &quot; Hunt said .
