   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; PRESSURE IS A DEFINITE HANG-UP TO PARREIRA ; BRAZIL : COACH FEELS HEAT FROM A NATION THAT HAS WON THREE WORLD CUP TITLES , BUT NONE SINCE 1970 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carlos Alberto Parreira has made_it this far , to the semifinal round of the World Cup , by a simple strategic maneuver , a slight stroke of coaching genius . Every hotel he checks_into , Parreira instructs the front desk operator to block all phone_calls . &quot; Then , &quot; Parreira says , &quot; I am at peace. &quot; The messages do pile_up , however . &quot; Excuse me , Mr. Parreira , but a Mr. Pele called_for you . He says he has six lineup changes he would like to propose , at your convenience . &quot; Also , someone claiming to be the president of Brazil called . A Mr. Itamar Franco . He sends his regards -- and suggests starting a third forward in the rematch with Sweden . &quot; Oh , and your mother called . She would like you to start Ronaldo , if it is not any bother. &quot; As manager of the New York Yankees of international soccer , Parreira is , if not the most embattled man in this World Cup , then a strong No . 2 behind Italy ' s coach , Arrigo Sacchi . Because he is entrusted with the most sacred tradition in the sport , and because the Brazilians haven ' t won the event in 24 years , Parreira approaches his daily news briefings like a man stepping_up to the electric_chair . And , in many ways , Parreira claims , the two positions are quite similar . &quot; It is a death sentence sometimes , &quot; Parreira said Monday in a session with the English-speaking media at a Fullerton hotel . &quot; Look , being a football_coach is my life . It ' s a pleasure . But being the coach of the Brazilian team in the World Cup . . . is something else . &quot; It ' s not a pleasure . It ' s effort . It ' s compromise . It ' s a commitment . &quot; You cannot have fun in this position . Only if you succeed and win the World Cup . Then it will be a full pleasure . But you ' ve got_to win the World Cup. &quot; Brazil has failed to do this since 1970 , which is why Brazilian World Cup coaches are discarded like World Cup programs . There ' s a new one every four years . Before Parreira , there was Sebastiao Lazaroni , who had the audacity to play a sweeper in Italy in 1990 . Pele , sort of a free-lance ombudsman of Brazilian football , was horrified , huffing that , &quot; This was not Brazil -- Brazil always plays three forwards &quot; and predicted Lazaroni would lose &quot; as soon as we play a good team. &quot; Brazil lost , 1-0 , to Argentina in the second round and Lazaroni was cooked . Tele Santana managed to survive both the 1982 and 1986 World Cups , but not without taking a three-year sabbatical in between . Claudio Coutinho didn ' t lose a game in the 1978 tournament , but because Argentina advanced to the final ahead of Brazil on goal differential , he was politely advised not to re-apply for same position . How powerful is the soccer press in Brazil ? Powerful enough that one of its own , a highly opinionated newspaper_columnist named Joao Saldanha , was actually appointed to coach Brazil ' s 1970 World Cup team . &quot; He was such a critic , &quot; says Francisco Marcos , Brazilian team liaison , &quot; that they decided to make him coach. &quot; Saldanha never coached in the World Cup , however . He brought the team through qualifying , but when he announced he was considering cutting Pele from the final roster -- too out of shape , Saldanha charged -- the Brazilian soccer federation fired him out of fear of national revolution . Mario Zagala replaced Saldanha , agreed to let Pele play and Brazil won the 1970 World Cup . Pele was named most_valuable_player . A month in the life of Carlos Alberto Parreira : -- After Brazil tied Sweden , 1-1 , in group play , Pele wrote in USA Today that Brazil &quot; couldn ' t play any worse &quot; and advised Parreira to replace six of his starters. &quot; -- Itamar Franco , the president of Brazil , also suggested Parreira shake_up his lineup . -- So did Parreira ' s mother , who is eager to see 17-year-old forward Ronaldo , the so-called future of Brazilian soccer , play . Joked Parreira : &quot; She ' s easy on me . It ' s only one change she wants to make. &quot; Parreira ' s good_humor amid the maelstrom caused one American journalist to ask how he can remain so calm at a time like this . &quot; On the outside , yes , &quot; Parreira said with a laugh . &quot; But on the inside , I am boiling , my friend. &quot;</TEXT>
