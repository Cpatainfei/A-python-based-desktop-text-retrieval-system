   <HEADLINE> INS URGED TO SETTLE BLACKS ' BIAS COMPLAINT ; DISCRIMINATION : HOUSE COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN ADVISE AGENCY CHIEF TO LEARN FROM LESSON OF THE FBI , WHICH DEALT WITH SIMILAR CHARGES LAST YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citing well-founded charges of discrimination , three powerful congressional committee chairmen have urged Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner to settle a complaint alleging agencywide bias against African American officers . &quot; The INS should . . . move expeditiously toward recognition of the well-founded claims of federal employees for simple justice , &quot; the three congressmen wrote in a March 1 letter to Meissner . The legislators urged Meissner to learn from the experience of the FBI , which last year settled similar discrimination claims on behalf of more_than 400 black agents . Among other things , the bureau agreed to promote blacks to supervisory slots . Urging the INS to settle were House Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks ( D-Tex. ) , John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , head of the Committee on Government Operations , and William L . Clay ( D-Mo. ) , chairman of the Committee on Post_Office and Civil Service . The three committees oversee employment practices at the Justice_Department , parent body of the INS and FBI . The department ' s many tasks include enforcement of laws banning discrimination . Ralph Thomas , who directs congressional and public affairs for the INS , declined to comment on the legislators ' request to Meissner . The INS has not responded directly to the charges of discrimination , but agency officials have acknowledged disparities in representation of African Americans in management . Blacks account_for more_than 11 % of the INS payroll , agency figures show , but they occupy fewer than 6 % of the best-paying jobs . Black INS officers have cited 14 years of alleged discrimination , including workplace harassment , imposition of unequal discipline and bias in determining promotions . The officers are seeking back pay , promotions , and wide-ranging reform of the agency ' s personnel policies . The INS officers ' complaint -- which originated with black criminal investigators in the Los Angeles district -- is pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , an independent federal body that investigates bias charges . An administrative_law judge last month certified the_matter as a class action , broadening it to include more_than 500 INS employees and former workers nationwide .</TEXT>
