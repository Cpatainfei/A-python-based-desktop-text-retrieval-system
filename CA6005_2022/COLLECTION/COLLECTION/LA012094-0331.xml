   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK ; SCIENTISTS PONDER NORTHWARD CONCENTRATION OF QUAKES ; SEISMOLOGY : EXPERTS WONDER IF 20-YEAR TREND OF TEMBLORS NEARER SAN GABRIEL AND SANTA SUSANA MOUNTAINS PORTENDS A LARGER ONE TO COME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As aftershocks continued to rattle the region Wednesday , scientists pondered the future effects of Monday ' s magnitude 6.6 earthquake , the eighth significant , damaging temblor since 1970 to occur along or near the so-called Front Range comprising the San Gabriel and Santa Susana mountains . Wednesday saw two of the strongest aftershocks yet , a magnitude 5.1 , followed just two minutes later by another 5.1. They occurred at 1:09 p.m. and 1:11 p.m. and were the fourth and fifth aftershocks in the magnitude 5 range -- not that unusual a number and intensity after such a strong quake , according to seismologists . ( A magnitude 4.4 aftershock had struck at 6:09 a.m. ) The latest strong aftershocks were centered six miles northeast of Simi Valley . Meanwhile , all_the seismic activity in the last 24 years has scientists pondering if a larger quake will occur somewhere along the Front Range_in the years ahead . From Lytle Creek northwest of San Bernardino , through Upland , Whittier Narrows , Sierra Madre , Pasadena , San Fernando , Northridge and coastal Ventura County , the quakes have been of at least magnitude 5 , with three close to magnitude 6 and two , including Monday ' s , in the strong mid-6 range . Each of these temblors has ruptured only relatively short segments of various thrust_faults . But earthquake scientists are now trying to determine whether these faults are independent of one another or are linked deep under the surface and could rupture all at once -- producing a major quake . Preliminary research , however , indicates that huge magnitude 7 or 8 quakes along the mountains have been rare . The largest in historical times , a magnitude 7 , occurred at Wrightwood in the eastern San Gabriels in 1812 . Nevertheless , Caltech ' s Egill Hauksson wrote two years ago in a book prepared by the Assn . of Engineering Geologists : &quot; A future magnitude 7.7 earthquake that could rupture all seven segments or the whole length of the Sierra Madre Fault cannot be excluded. &quot; But Hauksson quickly added that &quot; seismological and geological evidence for segmentation along the fault suggests that 6.4 to 6.6 earthquakes occur more frequently and that the magnitude 7.7 earthquake may be a very rare event. &quot; Lucille M . Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey has called the Sierra Madre Fault , extending along the San Gabriels for 75 miles , possibly the most dangerous near or in the Los Angeles Basin . But the magnitude 5.8 quake at Sierra Madre in 1991 broke only one of its seven segments . Hauksson said this week that there is also a question whether all_the quakes that have occurred along the northern edge of the Los Angeles Basin could portend a larger quake on the San Andreas Fault north and east of Los Angeles , a little more_than 25 miles northeast of the epicenter of the Northridge quake . &quot; You can ' t predict a Big One on the San Andreas based on the Front Range quakes , &quot; Hauksson said . &quot; But if one did occur , we ' d see an oodle of papers viewing what has happened in recent years as precursors. &quot; Another question concerns whether the hundreds of aftershocks that have been occurring this week could suggest the possibility of a larger quake relatively soon in the vicinity of Monday ' s Northridge temblor or in some particular direction away from it . Frequent aftershocks following the magnitude 6.1 Joshua_Tree quake of April 22 , 1992 , migrated in a northwestward direction and appeared to some scientists to have triggered the much larger 7.6 Landers quake of June 28 , 1992 . Hauksson said Wednesday that a Caltech analysis indicated some migration of aftershocks from the Northridge quake about five miles in a northwestern direction toward Ventura County . He said the aftershocks have now developed &quot; into a very energetic pattern , slightly above the normal. &quot; However , Hauksson told a news briefing that it is too early to reach any conclusions about the significance of this . He said a further migration would be analyzed carefully , if it develops . Altogether , there have been more_than 1 # 000 aftershocks since Monday morning , but the majority of them were too weak to be felt . Most scientists at media briefings at Caltech have suggested that the Northridge quake will not lead immediately to a bigger one , and the state Office of Emergency Services has thus far abstained_from issuing advisories of possible impending larger quakes , as it has occasionally done_in the past . The view by scientists of what may happen several years ahead is often less optimistic . Hauksson has pointed_out that the Front Range earthquakes since 1970 represent a distinct change from the pattern of quakes in and around Los Angeles in the early years of the century . Records show that there have been three major phases of seismic activity in the Los Angeles-Orange County area since 1920 . From 1920 to 1941 , all_of the most significant earthquakes occurred in southern or southwestern parts of the basin . In a second phase , from 1941 to 1971 , there were no quakes over magnitude 4.8 anywhere in the basin . Since then , in the third phase , all_the earthquakes in the 5 and 6 magnitude range have been at or near the northern edge of the basin , near the San Gabriel or Santa Susana mountains . Tracking the Quakes Between 1920 and 1941 , virtually all significant earthquakes in the Los Angeles area were in the southerly or southwest parts of the basin . After the magnitude 6.4 Sylmar-San Fernando quake in 1971 , there have been seven sizable , damaging quakes at the northern edge of the basin . Scientists now ponder whether the shift may_not portend a larger quake along the San Gabriel or Santa Susana Mountains , or possibly a big one on the San Andreas fault north and east of Los Angeles . Researched by KENNETH REICH and VICKY McCARGAR / Los Angeles Times How Earthquake Magnitude Is Measured There are 270 seismometers positioned throughout Southern California . By examining the interval between waves of quakes , seismologists can identify the epicenter and the magnitude . A look_at the three main types of waves , the sequence in which they occur and how they are measured for magnitude : Primary wave : Travels through earth . When it hits the surface , it causes buildings and other structures to contract and expand . Secondary wave : Travels through earth , moving rock back and forth , up and down . At earth ' s surface , it shakes structures violently . Long waves Love wave : Originates and travels_along earth ' s surface , shaking structures from side to side . Rayleigh wave : Originates and travels_along earth ' s surface , rolling like swells on the ocean . How Magnitude Scale Works Seismologists determine the magnitude of an earthquake by measuring two factors : time and amplitude . How Wednesday ' s 5.1 aftershocks appeared on a seismograph : Base line ( no quake activity ) Primary wave begins Secondary wave begins Time lapse : 24 seconds Amplitude : Highest peak 33 millimeters This chart measures time lapse between primary and secondary waves as well as distance in kilometers of that particular seismometer from the epicenter . A straight_line is drawn between the distance and amplitude charts to determine magnitude . Magnitude : 5.1 This chart measures amplitude , or the highest peak from the base line . How Seismometer Works Paper-covered drum makes a complete rotation every 15 minutes , records 24 hours of data . Horizontal Earth Motion Vertical Earth Motion A Quake ' s Energy Earthquakes release energy that scientists measure in metric_units called ergs . One erg is the amount of energy it takes_to move one gram of mass one centimeter in one second . Some examples of an earthquake ' s energy force : Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 9 Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 600 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 8 Example or equivalent : 1933 , largest quake recorded , Japan ( 8.9 ) Example or equivalent : 1906 San Francisco earthquake ( 8.3 ) Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 7 Example or equivalent : Energy generated by Niagara Falls_in four months Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 600 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 6 Example or equivalent : Energy to launch 2 million NASA space shuttles Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 , 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 5 Example or equivalent : Energy created by atomic_bomb test in 1945 Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 600 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 4 Example or equivalent : Kiloton of TNT exploding Energy released ( in millions of ergs ) : 20 # 000 , 000 # 000 Magnitude ( not to scale ) : 3 Example or equivalent : Smallest quakes commonly felt Source : The World Book Encyclopedia , Caltech , U.S. Geological Survey , Associated Press Researched by APRIL JACKSON and CAROLINE LEMKE / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
