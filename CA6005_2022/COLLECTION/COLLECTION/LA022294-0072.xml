   <HEADLINE> O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS ; FREEING WORDS FROM THEIR LIFE SENTENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now , why would someone organize an exhibition of rather mysterious work by a group of mostly little-known artists -- and then write an introduction larded with obscure words , difficult locutions and puzzling , fragmentary images ? Why try to compete with the wayward eccentricity of the artists ' own works ? The nine artists in_question are the focus of &quot; Grammarians &quot; at Chapman University ' s Guggenheim Gallery ( through March 11 ) . According to exhibition notes by curator Michael Anderson , himself an artist and a critic for Art issues magazine , &quot; Liberating writing from an everyday instrumentality , these artists purchase a brief sovereignty , and their work is a placard , as it were , of unalienated labor and personal digression. &quot; Translation : Unconstrained by everyday uses of language , the artists use words however they choose , either as the central or peripheral aspect of their work . Once you climb over Anderson ' s wall of words , however , you can appreciate his taste for his highly unusual approaches to language and imagery . Most of the works have to do with the involvement of belief , imagination , authority or famous precedents in our comprehension of a text . These are meaty themes , and the artists clearly assume an audience willing to dig for and evaluate different types of information . The effort is_well worth it . The wittiest works in the show are by Raymond Pettibon , one of the most gifted younger artists in Los Angeles , and Kenneth Goldsmith , the lone New Yorker in the group . Pettibon pairs spare , laconic drawings based on popular imagery with texts that combine turns of speech from various sources into a crafty polyphony suggesting diverse patterns of thought . In one of Pettibon ' s untitled works , we read the self-conscious thoughts of a callow male writer observing a woman in a short strapless dress ( &quot; I felt so_much that I just had to take_notes &quot; ) . In another drawing -- an archetypal baseball pitcher winding_up -- the verbal counterpoint includes a punning platitude ( &quot; Life at its highest_pitch &quot; ) and a comically dimwitted reflection ( &quot; What a beautiful moral to be drawn. &quot; ) Goldsmith ' s piece is an epic nonsense poem based on similarities between the sounds and rhythms of words and phrases drawn from high and low culture ( &quot; Rocky Horror Roto-Rooter Salmonilla Sandinista ! . . . Simon Boccanegra smells like Magic_Marker . . . &quot; ) . Like a hip , updated Vachel Lindsay ( the incantatory early 20th-Century American poet ) , Goldsmith plays_back the sounds of America , the commercial jingles and news headlines that rattle around in our heads . Frances Stark also employs lists of words in her art , but she focuses_on their arbitrary , exclusionary quality . &quot; Through the Magic Door &quot; consists_of mimeographed sheets_of_paper with hand-lettered lists ( imitating an antiquated typeface ) of the &quot; 100 Great Books. &quot; One list dates_from 1887 ; the other , which includes John Steinbeck ' s &quot; The Grapes of Wrath , &quot; from 1939 or later . The blue ink recalls vintage high_school course handouts , yet the hand-lettering bizarrely undercuts the text ' s supposed authority . A grudging acknowledgment of women ' s roles in society and American isolationism of the ' 30s may account_for the fact that the newer list includes five female authors ( in 1887 , only George Eliot made the grade ) , but eliminates such non-Western entries as the Koran and the Ramayana in favor of the_likes_of Sherwood Anderson ' s &quot; Winesburg , Ohio. &quot; And then there is Guy de Cointet , a French-born performance artist who died in 1983 and was known for such surreal pieces as &quot; My Father ' s Diary , &quot; in which the book in_question , a memento read by the man ' s daughter , turns_out to be written entirely in code . Influenced by French post-structuralist Roland Barthes , de Cointet was intrigued by the notion of language without meaning . Hence , &quot; Sophie Rummel &quot; -- de Cointet ' s piece in this show -- in which a numerical sequence like &quot; 700 . 12 . 663 . 10 . 8903 . 27. &quot; might stand_for an infinite number of facts about the fictional or real woman in the title . Can this code be cracked ? Does_it matter ? Isn ' t speculation often more interesting than knowledge ? Other artists in the show combine visual and written material to conjure small , weird universes that are at least fitfully absorbing , while a_couple_of pieces seem baffling or oddly vacuous . * Benjamin Weissman ' s stumbling , crumpled-looking figures look_like grim relations of the baffled folk immortalized by cartoonist William Steig . Combat between the sexes and generalized bleakness are the order_of_the_day . Several of these drawings have texts banged_out on a typewriter that seems to have a permanently stuck_shift key -- a dated , amateurish presentation that somehow matches the figures ' hopelessly cliched predicaments . A woman asks her avenging mate , &quot; Why must you always dent the head of another man ? &quot; He replies , &quot; My head is big . His head is little and also quite soft. &quot; Tyler Stallings ' sprawling fantasy piece , &quot; Castrato-Astronauta , &quot; mingles an ode to ' 50s-style science_fiction with a wistfully outrageous post-AIDS view of sex . ( The title evokes the bizarre image of a castrated boy singer who has become a female astronaut ) . A large birthday_cake made of pink felt ( and inscribed , &quot; Happy birthday cyberspace sad farewell outer space &quot; ) dangles over a fallen parachute and the castrato ' s lost member , which has become the body of a mutant spider . A photocopied &quot; news_story &quot; complete with bogus documentation , matter-of-factly relates the castrato ' s hallucinatory out-of-body experience , in which he becomes a male Virgin_Mary , agrees to donate sperm for artificial_insemination and contemplates guiltless sex with his grandmother . Alexis Hall ' s piece , &quot; Bora Bora , &quot; appears to be an archly self-conscious narrative about an art_school photography student who moonlights as a Los Angeles Police_Department secretary and is whisked_away to a crime scene by a man &quot; who assumes his identity through Marlboro ads and pulp novels. &quot; Printed on 10 large photographs ( ads for expensive accouterments and exotic travel , romance novel jackets ) , Hall ' s narrative reads like a clumsy pastiche of B-movie plots , pulp fiction and advertising . In fact , it is the &quot; fabulous ( ly ) successful &quot; art project the student says she made about her experience . By making her own slickly packaged form of &quot; art &quot; from a stew of gender stereotypes , she reinvents the same sort of hucksterism she appears to be critiquing . The most puzzling piece in the show might be Lisa Auerbach ' s set of color photographs , &quot; In Color . . . and in Black and White. &quot; Most of Auerbach ' s suburban images are of foodstuffs : pumpkins growing in a field , shown chopped_up in a photograph in an open cookbook , and stewing in a pot on a kitchen_stove . It is tempting to retitle the images , &quot; The Raw and the Cooked , &quot; the title of one of the books by French structuralist Claude Levi-Strauss that investigated formal relationships between different aspects of culture . But what spin Auerbach is putting_on this material is unclear . The one work that seems distinctly out_of_place in this company , however , is Gabrielle Jennings ' video , &quot; To Whom It May Concern &quot; ) . In the tradition of the rambling , tell-all adolescent diary , it details various out-of-control experiences ( a drinking binge , a drug trip ) of a young_woman -- supposedly herself -- whose mother was a hippie and who knows her father only from a photograph . Despite the visceral conceit that opens and closes the piece ( she has decided to cut_out her tongue and wants to leave a record of her life ) , &quot; To Whom It May Concern &quot; seems formless and lacking in critical and self-awareness . You wonder if she even realizes that she is invoking a sensation of nausea or vertigo to describe her reaction to virtually every event in her life . * &quot; Grammarians &quot; remains through March 11 at the Guggenheim Gallery , Chapman University , 333 N . Glassell St. , Orange . Hours : Noon to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday . Free . ( 714 ) 997-6812 .</TEXT>
