   <TEXT> Ratatouille , an aromatic casserole of eggplant , zucchini , peppers , onions and tomatoes , is a classic that has withstood the test of time . Originally from Nice on the_French Riviera , this luscious vegetable stew is often made at_home in France and is popular in restaurants and charcuteries throughout the country . Vegetarians make a meal of ratatouille with bread , rice or pasta , or roll it in a crepe . Meat-eaters serve it with grilled or roast chicken , lamb , beef or veal . Part of the reason for ratatouille ' s popularity is that the recipe is very forgiving . If you cook ratatouille a little too long , nothing bad will happen ; the vegetables are supposed to be tender . Some cooks prefer to use roughly equal amounts of each vegetable ; others recommend doubling the tomatoes . Green_beans , potatoes and mushrooms also find their way into some ratatouille pots . Garlic and olive_oil are the essential flavorings , and any herbs in season , especially thyme and fresh basil , can be incorporated . I have met French chefs who insist that you fry each vegetable separately . This is time-consuming , however , and tends to make the ratatouille rather oily . To simplify the preparation , I stew the onions , peppers and zucchini together . I cook the eggplant separately , but usually with a combination of sauteing and steaming , because it ' s easier than frying and requires less oil . When I use fresh tomatoes , I peel them and cook them briefly before combining them with the other vegetables . For a shortcut , I substitute diced canned tomatoes . In the Balkan countries , there ' s a similar vegetable casserole that takes its name from the Turkish earthenware pot it ' s traditionally cooked in , the guvec . In Bulgarian it ' s called givetch ; in Romanian , ghiveciu ; in Greek , youvetsi . Givetch starts_out with sauteed eggplant , tomatoes , peppers and onions , but then these vegetables are layered with uncooked vegetables -- any combination of carrots , okra , zucchini , celery , green_beans and potatoes -- and baked . During winter , givetch takes_on a different tone ; mushrooms , cauliflower , turnips , parsnips or dried beans might enter the pot . Hot pepper flakes , garlic and parsley are customary seasonings for givetch ; paprika , dill , thyme or rosemary might also be used . Givetch can be vegetarian or can be cooked with beef or lamb cubes or spicy sausages . Some versions are garnished at the last moment with green grapes . Although neither of these casseroles cooks quickly , both are very convenient . Prepare them in large amounts and keep them in the freezer , ready to pop into the microwave to reheat . You can serve them with baked or fried_eggs on top ; an English friend of mine does this with Ratatouille and calls the dish &quot; ratty eggs. &quot; Tarte a la ratatouille is a fairly recent use of the stew in Paris , in which it becomes a filling for a savory pastry shell . Or try other nontraditional uses : Turn ratatouille into a topping for pizza , toss ratatouille or givetch with spaghetti or rice , or use either stew as a filling for tortillas or pita breads . Both Ratatouille and givetch are delicious cold , and can be served as a salad , antipasto or side_dish . Either can be a cool , light summer meal if served on a bed of lettuce and accompanied by a little feta or goat_cheese , hard-cooked eggs or thin slices of smoked turkey breast . * This aromatic vegetable stew with garlic and herbs is one of the glories of Provencal cooking . It ' s wonderful hot or cold as a main dish or as a partner for grilled fish , chicken or steak . Naturally it ' s at its best in summer , when tomatoes , peppers , eggplant and zucchini are at their peak . You might like to garnish it with fresh basil .
