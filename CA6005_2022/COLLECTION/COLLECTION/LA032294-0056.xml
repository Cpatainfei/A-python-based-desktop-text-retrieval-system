   <HEADLINE> CRIME RATE FALLS 9.1 % IN COUNTY , HITS 15-YEAR LOW ; STATISTICS : A DRAMATIC 13.7 % DROP IN OXNARD , THE LARGEST AND MOST DANGEROUS CITY , PLAYS A ROLE IN THE OVERALL DECLINE , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crime in Ventura County fell by 9.1 % in 1993 , to a rate of 38.3 serious crimes per 1 # 000 residents -- the lowest in at least 15 years . The rate was driven downward by a dramatic 13.7 % drop_in crime in Oxnard -- the county ' s largest and usually its most crime-ridden city -- and by double-digit percentage drops_in crime in Port Hueneme , Fillmore and Simi Valley . Ventura County still enjoys one of the lowest crime_rates for an urban_area in the United States , but the statistics released by its law_enforcement agencies show that the county grew even safer overall in 1993 . The 9.1 % decrease in serious crimes countywide followed an increase in crime of 15.9 % from January , 1990 , to December , 1992 . Violent crime fell by 3.4 % countywide , the first time since 1989 that Ventura County has enjoyed a decline in the number of homicides , rapes , robberies and aggravated assaults . The rate had actually increased by 27.1 % from 1990 to 1992 . And property crimes fell_off by 9.8 % in 1993 , after increasing by 14.4 % during the previous three years . Law_officers across the county took some credit for the property crime decrease , saying they arrested more drug suspects than ever before , cleaning the streets of people who often steal . Undersheriff Richard Bryce said deputies made 390 more drug arrests last year than in 1992 in the unincorporated areas of Ventura County and in the five cities that his department covers -- Camarillo , Fillmore , Moorpark , Ojai and Thousand Oaks . The drug arrests and more cooperation from the public have helped cut property crime , he said . Yet while crime decreased overall countywide , the contract cities and unincorporated areas protected by the Sheriff ' s Department suffered a 4.9 % increase in violent crimes in 1993 . That was not as steep as the 15 % increase in violent crimes in those areas reported to the sheriff in 1992 , but it is &quot; a great concern , &quot; Bryce said . &quot; I just think we ' re becoming more of a violent society and acting_out our frustrations , &quot; he said . &quot; You especially see that in the home. &quot; Seven out of 10 violent crimes reported to the Sheriff ' s Department were aggravated assaults , nearly one in four springing out of domestic disturbances , he said . In one out of 12 aggravated assaults , a deputy_sheriff was the victim , he said . Taken as_a_whole , however , the 3.4 % decrease in violent crimes across Ventura County was a welcome turnaround from an 8.5 % increase reported in 1992 . Port Hueneme enjoyed the steepest decrease of serious crime of any Ventura County city , dropping 21.2 % in 1993 , followed by Fillmore with a 20 % decrease and Simi Valley , where crime fell by 18.5 % . * Port Hueneme residents and businesses reported 36.4 % fewer burglaries and 26.4 % fewer thefts in 1993 than the previous year , according to statistics the city reports each year to the FBI . Port Hueneme may also have fared better than usual in its number of property crimes because a rash of residential burglaries that traditionally afflicts people at Christmastime failed to develop , Port Hueneme Police_Chief John Hopkins said . &quot; We didn ' t have that until after the first of the year this year , &quot; he said . Fillmore residents also reported less property stolen in 1993 , with a decrease of 22.2 % in burglaries and 24.1 % fewer thefts . Yet one of the most dramatic turnarounds occurred in Oxnard , where crime decreased by 13.7 % in 1993 -- the lowest crime_rate in 20 years . Oxnard remains the most violent city in Ventura County . While 21 % of Ventura County residents live there , 43 % of all violent crimes are committed there . But that trend may be reversing . Just two years ago , 47 % of the violent crimes in Ventura County were committed in Oxnard . There were 1 # 446 violent crimes reported in Oxnard in 1993 -- a drop of 180 from the previous year -- and 7 # 244 property crimes , a decrease of 1 # 194 from 1992 . &quot; I think there ' s been a lot of hard work by the officers on the street , as well as support from neighborhood patrols and Neighborhood Watch groups , &quot; Oxnard Police_Chief Harold Hurtt said . &quot; You ' ve got_to count_on a little luck , too. &quot; In Santa Paula , however , violent crimes reached a six-year high in 1993 . The crime_rate there swelled to the highest in the county -- 59.5 crimes per 1 # 000 Santa Paula residents , compared with 58.1 per 1 # 000 Oxnard residents . The number of robberies in Santa Paula increased 24 % to 223 in 1993 , and assaults jumped 47 % to 149 . By contrast , Moorpark , with a population of 26 # 700 , enjoyed the lowest crime_rate in Ventura County -- 19.4 crimes per 1 # 000 residents . Moorpark , Camarillo , Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks remained the county ' s safest cities . Simi Valley had only 28.1 serious crimes per 1 # 000 residents , while Thousand Oaks had 29.9 per 1 # 000 . The statistics promise to keep the two cities among the safest in the United States with populations of more_than 100 # 000 . Both rates were better than the lowest crime_rate recorded last year by the FBI -- 30 crimes per 1 # 000 in Amherst Town , a suburb of Buffalo , N . Y . Simi Valley ' s violent crime_rate remained about the same , but it reported 19.6 % fewer property crimes than in 1992 , due in large part to more police work , Capt . Jerry Boyce said . &quot; The only thing we ' ve done differently is we ' ve doubled the size of our Special Enforcement Detail ( to six ) , &quot; he said . In Ventura , violent crimes decreased markedly , from 453 in 1992 to 396 last year -- with almost all_of the drop occurring in robbery , which dropped from 186 to 139 . Police said they are encouraged by the decrease , but they noted that crime patterns fluctuate from year to year . &quot; Things go_down and things go_up , &quot; said Sgt . Bob Anderson , supervisor of the Ventura Police_Department ' s major crimes unit . &quot; I don ' t know if you can count_on any particular reason or credit any particular effort. &quot; VENTURA COUNTY CRIME STATISTICS 07 # 14 , 06 # 10 , 06 # 09 , 09 # 10 Agg .
