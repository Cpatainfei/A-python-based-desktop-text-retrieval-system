   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; ' TRANSTEXTUALISM ' : WORKS TO READ , SEE , FEEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If they could , the paintings , sculptures , drawings and photographs in &quot; Transtextualism &quot; would reach_out and touch you on the tips of your fingers . Being inanimate objects , however , the works in this jumbled exhibition at Mark Moore Gallery , organized by artist Sabina Ott , do the next best thing : They attempt to get viewers to physically engage them , to run hands , fingers or eyes across their variously textured surfaces . The most captivating pieces in the uneven , 21-artist show instill some tension between seeing and touching . The least interesting works settle for studying nit-picking differences between looking and reading . Among the former category is the show ' s most massive object , a pile of rocks unceremoniously stacked in the middle of the gallery . About half of the hefty stones in Wendy Adest ' s &quot; Lair &quot; have been carefully wrapped with silky fabric printed with a leopard-skin pattern . To the eye , Adest ' s sculpture looks_like a pile of rough rocks interspersed with soft , chiffon-covered cushions . Only upon squeezing the artist ' s fraudulent pillows do you discover how uncomfortable they are . A hands-on , curious and untrusting approach reveals &quot; Lair &quot; to be a liar . Adest ' s deceptive sculpture registers a decisive gap between the ways one ' s eyes and hands function . Buzz Spector ' s dismembered and reconfigured books evince an even more pronounced fusion of violence and beauty . Torn to shreds and meticulously glued back together , his dysfunctional texts are not readable . As you silently sound-out their nonsensical articulations , you have to listen to them in your inner_ear . They show that language is not a disembodied abstraction , but a substantial , physical entity . Like a babbling cacophony of randomly arranged vowels and consonants , Spector ' s ripped pages give form to the multilayered texture of language , to guttural utterances , delicate intonations and monosyllabic ejaculations . Sally Elesby ' s slight , wiry confections ; Christopher French ' s abstract painting on pages of Braille ; Vernon Fisher ' s damaged photographs and Nicolas Rule ' s drippy , runny picture of a thoroughbred ' s lineage similarly give shape to charged differences between visual and tactile experience . Stephen Berens ' &quot; Attempt to Make My Statement From 1977 More Closely Reflect My Work From That Period &quot; is a hilarious attempt to conflate looking and reading . By juxtaposing a blurry photograph of a landscape with a typed artist ' s statement whose words have been shifted to imitate the photo ' s tonal modulations , Berens demonstrates that images and words serve different purposes . His clever diptych reveals the absurdity of trying to get language to function pictorially . Nearly all_of the other pieces in the exhibition treat language abstractly , as an intangible structure to be read from a distance , or as a static element to be redesigned visually . As a result , the texts employed by these works lack texture . Viewers are left with little to read , less to see and still less to feel . Aside from a handful of satisfying exceptions , &quot; Transtextualism &quot; doesn ' t offer much to grab onto , either physically or conceptually . * Mark Moore Gallery , 2032-A Broadway , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 453-3831 , through Sept . 1 . Closed Sunday and Monday . * Objects of Reverie : Alison Van Pelt ' s oils-on-canvas at Robert Berman Gallery try to transfer the mystique of old photographs to nearly life-size painted portraits . Initially , the L.A.-based artist ' s ghostly images of solitary , nude women shrouded in indistinct , atmospheric blurs look sexy . Specific details disappear into the shadows , leaving viewers free to fantasize about the mysterious women Van Pelt conjures with her paintbrush . Their lithe bodies and incandescent skin seem to be bathed in the warm glow of flickering candle light . After the superficial allure of Van Pelt ' s pictures wears_off , they begin to resemble painstakingly rendered yet opportunistic imitations of Gerhard Richter ' s chilling paintings of murdered student_nurses from the 1960s , portraits of German intellectuals from the 1970s , and haunting suite of images from the 1980s , depicting the members of the Baader-Meinhof gang who met mysterious deaths in prison . In contrast to Richter , whose figurative works draw their often tragic subjects from social_events while poignantly reflecting upon public memory and amnesia , Van Pelt chooses to depict typically attractive , imaginary women as objects of private reverie . This strategy echoes that of conventional pornography . Her work lacks the resonance of Richter ' s elegiac paintings . Close inspection reveals that Van Pelt ' s surfaces are slap-dash and thin in contrast to Richter ' s lush , gradually built-up layers of paint , which facilitate a wider range of tonal variations . Making paintings that resemble paintings that resemble photographs fails to turn the tables in Van Pelt ' s favor , instead diminishing the power of her technically proficient but unimaginative art . * Robert Berman Gallery , 2044 Broadway , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 453-9195 , through Sunday .</TEXT>
