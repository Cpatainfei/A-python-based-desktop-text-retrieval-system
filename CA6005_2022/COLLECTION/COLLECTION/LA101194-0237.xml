   <HEADLINE> BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN_GULF ; KUWAITIS SKEPTICAL OF IRAQI PULLBACK CLAIM ; SECURITY : OFFICIALS SAY ONLY PROOF WILL SATISFY THEM . THEY ALSO WANT U.S. TO HELP ENSURE THEIR LONG-TERM SAFETY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kuwait reacted with sharp skepticism Monday to Iraq ' s declaration that it was pulling its troops back from their tense border , and warned that such a move alone would not be enough to end the new Gulf crisis . &quot; If they pulled_back their forces a_few kilometers to the north , they could come_back in a_couple_of days , &quot; said Saud al Sabah , Kuwait ' s information minister . &quot; This is a cat-and-mouse game with us , and we can ' t tolerate it . . . . &quot; We cannot , and the international community cannot , take these statements seriously . We will believe them when we see them . . . . We want to see facts taking_place on the ground and corroborated by satellites and intelligence. &quot; Ahmed Hamoud al Sabah , the defense minister , said neither his forces nor U.S. intelligence had any evidence that Iraqi troops , put at 80 # 000 men with 700 tanks , had started to withdraw to positions deeper inside Iraq . Kuwait , however , wants more_than just an Iraqi retreat , officials said as they evaluated Baghdad ' s latest statements , for that would do little to ensure the oil-rich emirate ' s long-term security . &quot; Saddam Hussein has shown that he can put a gun to our heads anytime he wants , &quot; a member of the Kuwaiti Parliament said after a lengthy closed-door discussion of security preparations . &quot; It ' s really not enough that he didn ' t pull the trigger today . We want to know that he won ' t pull it tomorrow. &quot; Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah , the crown_prince and prime_minister , had told the emergency session of Parliament that Kuwaitis need not fear a repetition of Iraq ' s 1990 brutal seizure and occupation of their country -- that the world would not permit another takeover . &quot; The military situation has changed a lot in Kuwait ' s favor , and it will continue doing so in coming hours , &quot; Saad said as the first 300 combat troops from the U.S. Army ' s 24th Mechanized Division arrived here by air from Ft . Stewart , Ga. , and American and British warships took_up positions in the Persian_Gulf . Encouraged by the Clinton_Administration ' s tough line , Kuwaiti officials said they will press Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher when he arrives here Wednesday for a strategy that will ensure Kuwait ' s long-term security without establishing a large and permanent U.S. presence in the Gulf , without subjecting Washington to the vagaries of Iraqi policies and without requiring costly troop deployments . &quot; Sooner or later we have to get_rid_of this dictator , &quot; the prince said of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . &quot; The whole international community would like to get_rid_of Saddam Hussein. &quot; Other officials stressed the need for measures that would prevent Iraq from escalating tensions as it has this week -- or at least punish it for doing so . &quot; If Iraq can cause an international crisis by such so-called maneuvering its forces within its borders , then there must be restraints on such actions , &quot; a senior Kuwaiti diplomat said . &quot; We have said all this before , but perhaps now the dangers are clearer to everyone . This is what we will put before Christopher. &quot; The secretary_of_state will meet here with the foreign_ministers of Saudi_Arabia , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as well as Kuwait on Wednesday as part of his visit to the Middle_East . Although his stop here was intended to show U.S. solidarity for Kuwait in the current crisis , the six Arab states would like to transform that support into a permanent deterrent to Iraq . Kuwait also hopes , diplomats said , that the United States will be able to reconstitute much of the broad coalition it led during the Persian_Gulf_War . In his address to Parliament before the closed_session , Saad said that &quot; there is no reason for worry or fear , &quot; continuing the government ' s efforts to reassure a nation traumatized by the 1990-91 occupation . Kuwait ' s allies will remain fully deployed , he said , until &quot; everybody is sure that these Iraqi troops that have converged ( on the border ) from different places have gone_back to where they were before. &quot; Kuwait ' s own 18 # 000 troops are fully deployed along its northern frontier and are most immediately concerned about the 20 # 000 men staying in an Iraqi tent camp just over the border . Iraq says the men are Kuwaitis or stateless Arabs who used to live here and want to return ; Kuwait says they are Iraqi soldiers in civilian clothes ready to push across in a &quot; provocation. &quot; &quot; At this point we are in a defensive mode , &quot; Maj . Gen . Ali al Muamin , the Kuwaiti chief_of_staff , told journalists visiting the border area . &quot; We shall leave these people to be dealt with by the proper agencies such_as the Red_Cross , the United Nations and the police . &quot; But some of them are in very good physical shape . They do not look_like civilians to me. &quot; Muamin added : &quot; We are ready for any invasion . I am very proud_of my men . They now have the experience from the liberation of Kuwait ( in the Gulf War ) . We are not going_to run_away from the Iraqis this time. &quot; Although Kuwaitis have remained calm , many have begun to take precautions , withdrawing cash from local banks , stocking up_on food , water and other provisions , filling their cars with gasoline in case they need to make a quick getaway across the desert to Saudi_Arabia . The actual 130-mile-long demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait was_quiet Monday . Vesselin Kostov , a spokesman for the United Nations ' Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission , said the Iraqi forces were still out_of_sight . &quot; From our position in the DMZ we could not witness the movements of the Iraqis to the south , so we could not , of course , witness any moves to the north , &quot; Kostov said when asked to confirm the Iraqi announcement of a troop pullback .</TEXT>
