   <HEADLINE> REBELS KILL 7 IN TAJIK BORDER ATTACK ON RUSSIAN SOLDIERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 250 Muslim militants stormed across the border from Afghanistan and attacked Russian troops in the biggest border clash this year in Tajikistan ' s civil_war , officials said Friday . The Russian soldiers drove_back the rebels after five hours of fierce fighting that left seven Russians and about 50 militants dead , Russia ' s Foreign Ministry said in Moscow.Fourteen Russian troops were wounded . Russian forces supporting the government in the former Soviet republic will continue to take &quot; decisive action , &quot; the ministry said . The Tajik government defeated a loose coalition of pro-democratic forces and Islamic fundamentalists in a bloody civil_war in 1992 that claimed at least 20 # 000 lives . Muslim rebels hoping to topple the pro-Communist government periodically cross the border into Tajikistan from bases in Afghanistan . Russian troops were sent to Tajikistan last year to stop what Moscow calls a flood of drugs , weapons and Islamic fundamentalism . The Central Asian_nation was relatively calm through the first part of this year , but rebels recently stepped_up their hit-and-run attacks . In the latest battle , the rebels heavily shelled the Russian border guards overnight from outposts in Afghanistan , then launched a pre-dawn attack across the border , said Valentin Malyutin , a spokesman for Russia ' s border guards in Moscow . Russia on Friday demanded that the Afghan government take urgent steps to stop attacks from its side of the border . Afghanistan has denied supporting the Tajik rebels but concedes it has little control over the rugged frontier region . Officials said Friday ' s attack apparently was staged by Kori Hamidullo , a Tajik rebel commander who headed a similar attack last year on the same border outpost in which 25 Russians were killed .</TEXT>
