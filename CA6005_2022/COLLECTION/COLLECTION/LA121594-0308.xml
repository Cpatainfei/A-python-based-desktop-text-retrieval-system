   <HEADLINE> REBEL CHECHENS READY FOR NEW RUSSIAN ASSAULT ; CAUCASUS : THE RENEGADE REPUBLIC EXPECTS A FIGHT TODAY AS DEADLINE TO SUBMIT TO THE KREMLIN EXPIRES . A HELICOPTER FROM MOSCOW IS SHOT DOWN AS PEACE TALKS FALTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Showing no chink in their defiance , rebel Chechens shot_down a Russian helicopter gunship Wednesday and steeled themselves for the bloody storm of their capital that they expect when the deadline to submit to Kremlin rule expires today . Peace talks , mired in the dispute over whether the mountainous Muslim republic is part of Russia , broke_down , and Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev went_on television to exhort his citizens to smite the Russian interlopers until they &quot; die of fear and horror. &quot; Russian tank columns closing in on Grozny from three directions stopped six to 10 miles from the Chechen capital , according to Russian Nationalities Minister Nikolai Yegorov , who is largely handling the crisis for the Kremlin . The troops were ordered to seal_off the city early today . Declaring that the Russian forces moved_into Chechnya to &quot; liberate it from the Dudayev regime , &quot; Yegorov said they would not storm Grozny before the deadline but left ominously unclear what would happen next . He said only that Chechens who do not surrender their weapons will be disarmed by force . &quot; We appeal_to the leaders of the unlawful armed formations : Stop trying the long patience of the Federation ! &quot; an official Russian government statement said . Meanwhile , fighting broke_out sporadically north of Grozny . Chechen sources reported a massed attack of nearly 200 tanks and armored vehicles Wednesday evening on their position 10 miles northwest of the capital . They said missile and aviation attacks left 24 villagers dead to the capital ' s north , but Russian air_force officials denied that they had hit any civilian targets . Casualty counts in the four days of Russian intervention in Chechnya vary , but it appeared that dozens of people have been killed . Russia ' s Independent Television also reported that about 100 soldiers have been taken prisoner . To the southwest of Grozny , Chechen militants shot_down a Russian helicopter gunship and , according to Russian counterintelligence chief Sergei V . Stepashin , &quot; literally tortured the crew &quot; to death . Video footage on Russian television_showed Chechens kicking the wounded pilot onto a stretcher . In Moscow , reports on the Chechen offensive dominated the newspapers , many of them full of trepidation . &quot; War won ' t solve a single problem , &quot; read a headline in the respected New Times magazine . &quot; The Afghanistan variation is proposed for solving the Chechen problem. &quot; A poll by the Russian Mnenie service found that although a majority of Russians thought the Chechnya crisis threatened Russia ' s integrity , only 11 % favored using force to resolve it . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , who underwent elective surgery on his nose on the eve of the offensive , was expected to return to work in the Kremlin today , a spokesman said . World response to the Chechnya conflict has been fairly muted . Western countries , including the United States , have said that they see Chechnya as Russia ' s internal problem and that it would be in nobody ' s interest for Russia to disintegrate . Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev let the world know Wednesday that its response should stay that way . &quot; I would n ' t advise anyone to interfere in Russia ' s internal affairs , &quot; he said . Chechnya , which has fought Russian attempts to incorporate it since the 18th Century , declared its independence in 1991 . Moscow tried everything from talks and economic pressure to covert support for Dudayev ' s opposition to bring it back into the fold , but nothing worked . On Sunday , the Kremlin sent_in tank columns and thousands of troops backed by planes and helicopters . It said military pressure would help bring results at_peace talks . Russian officials said they would not storm Grozny , only encircle it . They also sought to stop the influx of arms and supplies to Chechen rebels . Bad_weather has hindered the operation , as has unexpected resistance from residents in the republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan who blocked the Russian troops as they passed_through toward Chechnya . Yegorov laid_out the Kremlin ' s long-term plan for the republic of about 1.2 million people . He said he plans to stay in Grozny as the president ' s representative and oversee the imposition of the Russian constitution here and elections in 1995 . Dudayev had different plans . He told his citizens that &quot; the soil must burn under the feet &quot; of Russian soldiers , and he told central Ostankino Television that he will never forsake his resistance to Russian rule . The Russian troops &quot; will be attacked from the rear in the traditional tactic of mountaineers , &quot; he said . &quot; Hit and run , hit and run , until they give_up out of fear and terror. &quot; In Grozny , the streets were largely deserted except for residents lining_up for bread . There appeared to be little hope that negotiations would allow Moscow and Grozny to avoid greater bloodshed . Although the Chechen side said it had left the talks in the neighboring city of Vladikavkaz merely for a &quot; working break , &quot; it also refused to sign a document acknowledging that Chechnya is part of Russia . &quot; We were put_in a position in which we had no choice but to cut_off the talks , &quot; Usman Imayev , the chief prosecutor of Chechnya , told Russia ' s Itar-Tass news_agency . Yegorov said Chechnya had demanded that it be treated at the talks as an independent state , and &quot; We will never agree to that. &quot; Boudreaux reported from Grozny and Goldberg from Moscow .</TEXT>
