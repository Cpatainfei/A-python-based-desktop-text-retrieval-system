   <TEXT> The 52-game , 24-team World Cup has down come_to this : Italy and Brazil have earned the right to play today at the Rose Bowl . Claudio Taffarel Caps : 82 Up close : Brazil ' s vaunted offense and underrated defense have made_for a relatively easy tournament for Taffarel , who has only needed to make 12 saves . That should change today . . . . Erratic club season culminated with a shutout for Reggiana against European champion A.C. Milan . Jorginho Caps : 73 Up close : Has emerged as the most dangerous defensive player of the tournament with his runs deep down the right side and is considered among the world ' s best right defenders . . . . Assisted on game-winning goal in semifinals with perfect cross to Romario . . . . Anchored German League champion Bayern Munich ' s defense last season . Mauro Silva Caps : 44 Up close : Has been unable to fill the team ' s dire need for a creative midfielder despite ample opportunity . . . . A teammate of Bebeto ' s in the Spanish League and together they led Deportivo La Coruna to second place behind Barcelona . Branco Caps : 76 Up close : A solid but unspectacular member of the defense with a good scoring touch_on free_kicks . . . . Scored the game-winning goal against the_Netherlands on a free_kick . . . . Returned to play professionally in Brazil after stints in Italy and Portugal . Bebeto Caps : 85 Up close : Has three goals , two assists and the best front-line partner a forward could ever request . . . . Did not have much of an impact against Sweden , although could have field_day against depleted Italian defense . . . . Key component in La Coruna ' s failed bid to win Spanish League . Dunga Caps : 55 Up close : One of the tournament ' s great name contrasts . He ' s nicknamed &quot; Dunga the Destroyer &quot; across Europe but his name means Dopey in Portuguese . . . . A defensive player whose presence limits the midfield ' s offensive creativity . . . . Style perfect for VfB Stuttgart in German League . Zinho Caps : 40 Up close : A major disappointment who has not played well enough to justify Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira ' s decision to leave the heralded Valdo off the team . . . . Has shown only flashes of potential on offense . . . . One of few national team members still playing professionally in Brazil . Rai Caps : 56 Up close : With Mazinho playing poorly , he was inserted against Sweden and played even worse , consistently giving the ball away . . . . Play inspired chants of &quot; Cafu , Cafu &quot; from fans wanting tio see a different midfielder . . . . Helped Paris win French League title . Romario Caps : 56 Up close : Has five goals , one assist and the best front-line partner a forward could ever request . . . . Only concern is midfield ' s inability to get him the ball , forcing him to back track to gain possession and then create own opportunities . . . . Cannot be guarded by only one defender . . . . Played_on Barcelona team that was trounced by AC Milan , 4-0 , in European Cup_final . Aldair Caps : 26 Up close : Major knee surgery in 1993 has done nothing to slow Aldair , whose play in the middle has been solid . . . . Has teammed with Marcio Santos to lead a defense that has allowed only three goals . . . . Played in Portugal before joining Roma of the Italian league . Marcio Santos Caps : 41 Up close : Won a spot in the starting lineup because of an injury to Mozer and seems unlikely to ever give it up . . . . Has been tenacious heading away balls in the middle . . . . Currently plays professionally in France , but excellent World Cup should land him in a better league soon . Mazinho Caps : 53 Up close : Hanging on to starting job by a thread after being benched during semifinal . . . . Somehow missed a wide open net in first_half against Sweden . . . . Poor play in Italy led to his return to Brazilian pro league where he led Palmeiras to 1993 title . COACH : Carlos Alberto Parreira Age : 51 World Cup Experience : Coached Kuwait in 1982 tournament in Spain , the United Arab Emirates in 1990 in Italy and Brazil this year . World Cup Record : 5-5-2 Up close : Besieged by the Italian press , criticized for lineup decisions by his mother and Pele , Parreira has his team in the finals nonetheless . . . . Should be applauded for including Mario Zagalo , who coached Brazil to the World Cup title in 1970 , on his coaching staff . . . . Has coached the national teams of Kuwait , Saudi_Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and reportedly would be interested in directing U.S. team if Bora Milutinovic is not retained .
