   <HEADLINE> MUSIC ; CHANGE OF HEART ; JOHN ANDREW FREDRICK REALIZES IT ' S BEEN A MATTER OF TIMING AND TALENT , PLUS THE ETHEREAL STYLE OF J ' ANNA JACOBY , TO MAKE BLACK WATCH A SUCCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let ' s face it -- the Black Watch is a brainy band . Before founding member John Andrew Fredrick set his sights on rock ' n ' roll &quot; hugedom &quot; in 1988 , he was an aspiring novelist with a doctorate in English , teaching literature courses at UC Santa Barbara . When he was 350 pages into his first novel , however , he had a change of heart . &quot; I realized I could write three songs in the same amount_of_time it took_to write one page of prose , &quot; says the 33-year-old , who is partial to wearing baggy T-shirts and canvas deck shoes that make him look_like a demented member of an Ivy League crew . The Black Watch is currently touring behind its well received fourth album , &quot; Amphetamines &quot; on the New York-based Zero_Hour label . Backed by the distribution muscle of Rykodisc , Fredrick says the band is teetering &quot; on the brink of hugedom. &quot; The band plays tonight at Eagles Coffee_bar in North Hollywood . It ' s Black Watch ' s last local show before the group travels_to New York for a performance at the prestigious CMJ Music Marathon , a colloquium of the so-called &quot; alternative &quot; music industry . In mid-October , the band begins a six-week national tour . But such a bright-looking future has been a long_time coming . By Fredrick ' s calculations , four pages of prose after deciding to leave academia he had released his first record -- &quot; St . Valentine &quot; -- with the Black Watch , left his university job , scrapped his marriage and moved to Los Angeles , where he met violinist and guitarist J ' Anna Jacoby . Jacoby , 30 , had recently moved to Los Angeles from Northern California after getting a bachelor ' s degree in music performance . From the time she was 15 months old , her musician parents had been grooming her for a symphony career , but a chance meeting with Fredrick knocked 22 years of preparation off track . Fredrick and some friends were jamming together when he heard her practicing violin in a nearby apartment . &quot; Like night-blooming jasmine it came wafting down to us , &quot; Fredrick recalls , smirking at his overblown language . &quot; I asked her if she might be interested in_playing on our woozy ballads. &quot; She said she would . With Jacoby aboard , the Black Watch found its signature sound : aggressive white_noise guitars swirling beneath a haunting gauze of violin and finely crafted vocal melodies . It ' s a sound that draws inspiration from bands as diverse as the Beatles , My Bloody Valentine , Helium , American Music Club , Cocteau Twins and the Smiths . Fredrick calls it &quot; ethereal grunge. &quot; The band is rounded_out by two newer members , both of whom joined within the last year . Drummer David &quot; the David &quot; Walkama , 27 , brings another eclectic set of influences to the group . He ' s as likely to cite the influence of jazz drummers Elvin Jones and Tony Williams as he is thundering rock tom-tom ' ers John Bonham of Led Zeppelin or Dave Grohl of Nirvana . Chronic grease under the fingernails is the off-hours reminder of bassist Darin Danford ' s day job as a mechanic . The 28-year-old describes himself as an ' 80s reject . As evidence , he cites his yearlong search for an out-of-print CD by British post-punk band the Chameleons . &quot; When I found it , &quot; he says , &quot; I told myself I was in heaven . I never have to buy another CD. &quot; Pop critics in influential indie rock journals such_as Option , CMJ and Alternative Press have unanimously hailed the band ' s latest effort as a fulfillment of the promise hinted at in their third record , 1988 ' s &quot; Flowering. &quot; Independently released singles &quot; Come Inside &quot; and &quot; Whatever You Need &quot; have repeated the college-radio success of that album . Jacoby ' s playing_on &quot; Amphetamines &quot; stands_out like a sunflower in a field of dandelions . Her technical prowess and self-taught guitar innovations are just as responsible_for the record ' s appeal as Fredrick ' s songwriting . Her unusual chord voicings and classical background lend a refreshing melodic dynamic to otherwise conventional songs . One of the album ' s most compelling tracks is &quot; See You Around , &quot; which features the acetylene fuzz guitar of Medicine ' s Brad Laner behind Jacoby ' s endearing vocals . That jarring mix of distortion and delicacy is intentional , Fredrick says . &quot; We ' re always trying to write the perfect pop song , &quot; he says . &quot; And then we throw something in there to destroy it. &quot; Live , the band presents a harder , edgier sound than on record , propelled by Walkama ' s iconoclastic drumming and the grinding wash of Fredrick ' s guitar . Recent sets have been peppered with new songs , as well as titles from &quot; Amphetamines. &quot; The band ' s understated sense_of_humor has lately been evidenced by a penchant for playing a solemn , slowed-down version of Gordon Lightfoot ' s ' 70s hit &quot; If You Could Read My Mind. &quot; And , in keeping with the band ' s determination to maintain its indie credibility , don ' t expect the histrionics associated with mega-successful &quot; alternative &quot; bands such_as Pearl Jam or Red Hot Chili_Peppers . &quot; We kind of have a rule on stage , &quot; jokes Fredrick , &quot; that you should never have your feet further than shoulder-width apart . If you do , you may be in danger of posturing. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN Who : Black Watch , with opening band Abe Lincoln Story . Location : Eagles Coffee Pub , 5231 Lankershim Blvd. , North Hollywood . Hours : 10 tonight . Price : $ 5 . Call : ( 818 ) 760-4212 .</TEXT>
