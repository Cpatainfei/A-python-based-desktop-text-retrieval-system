   <HEADLINE> U.S. WEAPON-GRADE URANIUM PRODUCTION TOPS ESTIMATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S._government produced far greater quantities of highly enriched , weapon-grade uranium from 1945 to 1992 than previously known , Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary disclosed Monday . Government factories in Ohio and Tennessee produced 994 metric_tons of weapon-grade uranium , well above the usual estimate of about 700.Almost 259 metric_tons of the material , which is highly radioactive and relatively easy to convert into bombs , remains in the U.S. stockpile , according to Energy_Department figures declassified Monday . Weapon-grade uranium may be converted to civilian use , but the Energy_Department has not made a long-term decision about what to do with the surplus material . Some of it is to be retained as fuel for Navy reactors , officials said . But the Energy_Department wants to reduce the stockpile , and the Russian stockpile of about 500 metric_tons , to limit the threat that the material could fall_into the wrong hands . A bomb could be fashioned from 25 kilograms , according to the International Atomic Energy Agency , so each metric_ton could make 40 devices . The uranium figures were contained in hundreds of pages of material about the U.S. nuclear_weapon program made public by O ' Leary in the second phase of her &quot; openness initiative , &quot; an ambitious attempt to dismantle the department ' s history of classification and secrecy . O ' Leary also made public 48 radiation experiments conducted by the government on humans since the 1920s , including several cases in which radioactive isotopes were given to pregnant women , mental patients , or terminally ill persons . But the Defense_Department blocked disclosure of two other secrets long sought by independent researchers and anti-nuclear activists : the total number of warheads produced by the United States each year and the number now in the U.S. nuclear arsenal .</TEXT>
