   <HEADLINE> CAKE ; A BAKER ' S SECRETS : BE SWEET , BE RUTHLESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After months of intensive cake-baking , I have found the secrets of success . Now I bake cakes that are lighter and purer than any I can buy . You will too -- I promise . This is what you must do . * Arrange things so you ' ll have no interruptions . Air is the crucial ingredient in cake ; the instant you stop beating the batter , the incorporated air begins to escape . This means_time is of_the_essence , so be sweet , but be ruthless . * Use the best ingredients . That means the freshest . Replace spices and baking powder every six months , flour and cream_of_tartar annually . Use unsalted butter . Although salt , a preservative , can disguise the fact that butter ' s been in storage , it will never have the quality of got-to-be-fresh sweet butter . And cake flour , made from soft_wheat ( bread flour is made from hard_wheat ) , lets you produce an incomparably delicate crumb . * Have the ingredients at their optimum temperatures when you add them . The effect of softening butter to the consistency of mayonnaise ( short bursts of half power in the microwave work well ) was one of my most exciting discoveries -- it lets the butter whip to maximum airiness . Egg_yolks and whites must be warm for whipping too . Warm them by covering the eggs ( still in the shell ) in hot water before you light the oven . Unless specified , all other ingredients should be at room_temperature , about 70 degrees . * Measure with care . Measure liquid and soft solid ingredients in transparent measuring pitchers . For dry ingredients , use a nested measuring_cup set , which has separate cups for measuring a half or quarter cup , rather than trusting the marks on the side of a whole-cup measure . Set the appropriate cup over wax_paper and lightly spoon the dry ingredients into the cup ( dipping the cup into flour , for example , compacts it ) . Sweep the top even with a chopstick or pencil . * Mix at the appropriate speeds . Next to temperature of ingredients , I ' ve found this to be the most critical element . Faster is not better . Follow indicated speeds precisely . ( Speeds are given for portable mixers . If you ' re using a stand mixer , use one notch slower. ) * Don ' t overbake . Begin testing for doneness five to seven minutes before the recipe indicates . If your baking times are often at_odds with the recipe ' s , have your oven recalibrated by the utility company . * Serve the cake at the optimum time . Butter cakes are by far at their lightest on the day of baking . If you can ' t make and serve a cake the same day , bake a chiffon or sponge_cake rather than a butter cake . * One last note : Turning a cake out of its pan can be scary . Do this : Run a table_knife around the sides of the pan . Lay a cloth on the cake , then a rack or big plate over the cloth . Turn the whole_thing over , lift_off the pan , gently pull_off the lining paper and lay a second rack , feet up , over the cake . Then turn_over again , and the cake will drop top-side-up onto the rack . Remove the cloth and cool the cake away from drafts . When you ' re ready to present a cake , don ' t fret about fancy decorations . A pretty platter , perhaps with a paper doily , and a wreath of edible or silk flowers and / or leaves around the base of the cake are all you need to make a heart-stopping presentation . The three cakes that follow are models for their types . If you have a favorite cake flavor but a recipe hasn ' t lived_up_to expectations , apply these techniques to the ingredients . Then , if the cake isn ' t heavenly , look_for a recipe in a trustworthy source with a different balance of ingredients and try again . * This model butter cake recipe is perhaps the best you ' ll ever eat -- three sumptuous chocolate layers . To mix a non-chocolate butter cake , simply leave_out the chocolate . For a two-layer cake , just use two thirds of the ingredients . Remember that butter cakes should be served within 12 hours of baking . OLD-FASHIONED MILK_CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH MILK_CHOCOLATE FROSTING 3 1 / 2 cups sifted cake flour 1 / 2 tablespoon baking soda 1 / 2 teaspoon baking powder 1 / 2 tablespoon salt 6 ounces unsweetened chocolate , chopped into 1- to 2-inch pieces 1 cup water 1 cup unsalted butter , softened to consistency of mayonnaise 2 cups granulated sugar 1 / 2 cup light-brown sugar , lumps crushed , packed 1 1 / 2 tablespoons vanilla 6 extra-large eggs , warmed in shells 1 cup buttermilk or soured milk ( set 1 tablespoon fresh lemon_juice at bottom of measure and fill with sweet milk , let clabber ) , at room_temperature Milk_Chocolate Frosting Unsprayed or silk leaves , such_as rose , geranium or strawberry , optional Sift flour , baking soda , baking powder and salt together in bowl .

This cake causes a stir for its exquisite lightness , flavor and charm . The method for beating egg_whites in the recipe is to be noted . Chiffon_cake may be wrapped airtight and stored on the cool side of room_temperature for one day before serving . LEMON CHIFFON_CAKE WITH HONEY GLAZE AND THYME LEAVES 2 1 / 4 cups sifted cake flour 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder Rounded 1 / 4 teaspoon salt 3 fluid_ounces light flavorless vegetable_oil , such_as canola or safflower 1 / 4 cup egg_yolks ( 3 to 4 extra-large ) , warmed in shells before separating 1 / 2 cup cool water 1 / 2 cup fresh lemon_juice , at room_temperature 1 1 / 4 cups egg_whites ( 8 to 9 extra-large ) , warmed in shells before separating 1 / 2 teaspoon cream_of_tartar Finely shredded zest 1 lemon Honey Glaze Rounded 1 teaspoon herbs such_as fresh thyme , mint or chamomile , optional Into large mixing_bowl sift flour , 1 cup sugar , baking powder and salt .

Cool slightly . Makes about 1 cup . * Old-fashioned sponge_cake is timeless . Because it can be baked in any number of shapes and b ecause it lends itself to any number of finishes , sponge_cake may become the most useful in your repertory . A drift of sifted powdered sugar is all that ' s needed to finish sponge_cake . However , you can glaze it with warmed marmalade or jam ( perhaps with the addition of a_few drops of kirsch or rum ) . You can split the cake and fill it with preserves . You can slather it with whipped cream or your favorite frosting . Or blend just enough fresh lemon_juice into granulated sugar to make_it pourable and smooth_over this sparkling glaze . Or cloak the cake in chocolate -- beat an equal weight of softened , unsalted butter a tablespoon at a time into the melted chocolate , then let the glaze cool until thick enough to spread . Finally , if you have them , a strewing of rose petals would be in keeping . To cover the cake with glaze or frosting , you ' ll need 3 to 4 cups for the tube ; 1 1 / 2 cups for each loaf ; 2 1 / 2 cups for top , sides , and filling for two layers or the top and sides of the oblong ; about 2 cups for cupcakes . Wrapped airtight and set_in a cool place ( not the refrigerator ) , this sponge will stay_fresh up_to five days . SPONGE_CAKE 3 / 4 cup sifted cake flour 1 / 4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sifted cornstarch 1 / 2 teaspoon plus 1 / 8 teaspoon baking powder 1 / 4 teaspoon salt 1 / 2 cup ( 6 extra-large ) egg_yolks , warmed in shells before separating Scant 1 / 3 cup lukewarm water 2 tablespoons fresh lemon_juice 1 / 2 tablespoon vanilla 3 / 4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 cup ( 7 extra-large ) egg_whites , warmed in shells before separating 1 / 2 teaspoon cream_of_tartar Sifted powdered sugar , optional Bunch unsprayed rose petals , optional In bowl sift flour , cornstarch , baking powder and salt together .

Beat on high speed while sprinkling in 2 tablespoons sugar , 1 tablespoon at time . Continue beating just until , when beaters are lifted , peak in bowl holds , then flops . Add 1 / 3 whites to yolk mixture and blend_in with flat wire whisk or large flexible rubber spatula . Sprinkle flour mixture evenly over yolk mixture and fold until almost completely blended in . Add remaining whites and fold batter with large flexible rubber spatula just until thoroughly blended . Smooth batter into buttered 10-inch tube pan , 2 ( 9x5-inch ) loaf pans , 2 ( 9-inch ) cake pans , 1 ( 13x9-inch ) baking pan ( all bottoms_lined with waxed_paper ) , or about 24 ( 2 1 / 2-inch ) cupcake pans lined with cupcake papers . Gently push batter up against sides and tube , if used .
