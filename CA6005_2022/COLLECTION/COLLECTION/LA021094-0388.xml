   <HEADLINE> $ 30-MILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD CASE GOES TO JURY ; COURTS : TWO MONTHS OF TESTIMONY CONCLUDE IN FEDERAL CASE AGAINST MORRIS D . ENGLISH . HE IS CHARGED WITH SWINDLING 1 # 500 INVESTORS THROUGH HIS NOW-DEFUNCT WELLINGTON GROUP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After more_than two months of testimony , a federal_court jury will decide whether the leader of a now-defunct South Bay investment_firm swindled 1 # 500 investors out of more_than $ 30 million . Final arguments concluded this week in U.S. District Court in the fraud and money-laundering trial of Morris D . English , Jr. , 46 , former head of the Wellington Group investment_company . While about a dozen glaring investors looked_on , Assistant U.S. Atty . Jeffrey Isaacs told the jury that investors in English ' s company &quot; entrusted a good portion of their life savings to the defendant , and he stole it. &quot; Isaacs said English used some of the money to &quot; live a lifestyle his victims could only dream about , &quot; including expensive homes for himself and family members , private airplanes and other luxuries . Defense_attorney Richard Callahan argued that , although English made mistakes in running his company , he never tried to swindle anybody . &quot; Mistakes were made here , &quot; Callahan told the jurors . &quot; ( English ) is the first to admit it. &quot; But he added , &quot; Were his actions criminal ? Not on your life -- and more importantly , not on his life. &quot; * English could be sentenced to 450 years in prison if convicted on all 51 counts in the indictment . Outside court , some of the investors who lost money , many of them retirees , spoke bitterly of their losses . &quot; He ruined our lives , our children ' s inheritance , &quot; said Eleanor Sturman of Burbank , who said she lost $ 194 # 000 . &quot; He took_away everything a lot of these people had . We ' ve got old people who are eating dog_food because of him. &quot; According to prosecutors , the case began in 1984 , when English purchased a dormant Manhattan Beach company called Wellington Escrow Corp . for $ 7 # 000 . English later changed the name to The Wellington Group , moved to Rolling Hills Estates and began making short-term , interest-only loans to borrowers who secured the loans with real_estate . To fund the loans , prosecutors said , English solicited money from investors , promising them a 15 % to 16 % return on their investment . English advertised on radio and investors from across the country invested millions . Prosecutors say the company eventually evolved into a classic &quot; Ponzi scheme , &quot; with new investors ' money being used to pay_off old investors . Meanwhile , prosecutors allege , English diverted investors ' funds for his personal use . In 1990 the California Department of Corporations obtained a preliminary injunction to prevent Wellington from selling unqualified securities . The company later filed for bankruptcy , and , according to prosecutors , illegally omitted investors ' names from the list of creditors so the investors would n ' t find_out about it . English also concealed or destroyed numerous records concerning the company , prosecutors charge . Some investors say they didn ' t know anything was wrong until the interest payments on their investments abruptly stopped . By then it was too late to get their money back . The company ' s collapse sparked civil lawsuits involving hundreds of investors . The company has been placed in the hands of a court-appointed trustee who has been selling its remaining assets to pay_off investors . Some investors say they may get_back 10 or 15 cents on the dollar -- if that . English ' s criminal_court troubles began in 1991 , when he was charged in Torrance with eight counts of grand theft and writing bad_checks to investors . In a plea bargain he agreed to make_good on the checks , but was later arrested for failing to do so . Meanwhile , federal_agents were investigating his business affairs . English was arrested in May on the federal charges and has been held_in federal custody ever since . Testifying in his own defense , English denied that he ever tried to mislead investors . At times combative , he blamed many of his company ' s troubles on overzealous regulators , once referring to a state_Department of Corporations official as a &quot; DOC Nazi. &quot;</TEXT>
