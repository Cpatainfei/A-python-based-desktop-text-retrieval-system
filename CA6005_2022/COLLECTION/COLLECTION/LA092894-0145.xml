   <HEADLINE> SQUARE PEGS ? ; BEING REJECTED BY PEERS IS NOT ONLY HURTFUL , IT CAN CAUSE EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND BAD BEHAVIOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s the usual lively birthday bash for a bunch of 5-year-olds at a Chuck E Cheese . Children break from their parents ' grip upon arrival and race off to play together . Except for Laurie . She doesn ' t run to join her classmates . She doesn ' t want her mother to leave . Pudgy , with pigtails and a sad face , Laurie sits outside the social circle . Buddies with no one , she is_quiet and clingy . &quot; Her social skills are light-years behind the other children , &quot; her mother sighs , acknowledging the obvious difference in her daughter . &quot; I don ' t know what to do about it . Maybe I should hold her back a year in school. &quot; Laurie has been rejected by her peers . And although she feels intensely lonely , she is not alone . Millions of parents have heard the sounds of rejection : &quot; No one plays with me. &quot; &quot; I don ' t have any friends. &quot; Long dismissed as the unfortunate fate of some children , childhood educators and psychologists are becoming increasingly convinced that peer rejection represents much more_than an inevitable social pecking_order on school playgrounds . Recent research suggests that peer rejection is not only hurtful , it can hamper a child ' s development and even lead to long-term emotional or conduct disorders if ignored over many years . &quot; Being rejected in childhood truly is one of life ' s most harmful experiences , &quot; says Vivian Gussin Paley , a veteran kindergarten teacher in Chicago and author of a book on peer rejection . &quot; A lonely child , a child who feels bad for whatever reason , will simply not concentrate_on the task at_hand . Each year , these children come_in feeling less confident in making friends. &quot; Thanks to the recent attention given to peer relationships , however , there are some effective , new strategies to help almost any child fit_in . But the tactics are not simple : Parents , teachers , the child and even the child ' s classmates all need to help in putting a stop to the rejection . * Almost all parents hear their children complain about a lack of friends . But often , the child is simply upset about a single incident , such_as when one of Bobby ' s 20 buddies is mean to him . The complaint should be taken seriously , however , when it ' s repeated over several months , when a teacher verifies the situation or when parents simply observe that their children aren ' t playing with others by the first_grade , says Duke University psychologist John D . Coie , a leading authority on peer rejection . &quot; Sometimes it ' s a transient thing . But if a child is rejected year after year by peers , that is really important , &quot; he says . It ' s important to distinguish between children who are loners and children who are lonely because they have been rejected , Coie adds . &quot; Being a loner is not a problem . A lot of very competent children do things by themselves all through life . The issue is not being able to get_along_with peers , &quot; he says . Usually children who don ' t get_along_with their peers complain about it . At any one time , an estimated 10 % of children are actively excluded by their peers , studies show . But an astute teacher or parent can usually guess which children are at risk for peer rejection before it happens . These are the children who are obnoxious or bullying , shy and withdrawn or highly intelligent . &quot; At least half of all rejected kids also show signs of ( being disruptive ) in school . That is the group that has the highest rate of risk and the ones we worry about the most , &quot; says Coie , co-editor of the book &quot; Peer Rejection in Childhood &quot; ( Cambridge_University Press , 1990 ) . Sometimes these children are also found to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , a developmental problem that causes children to be disruptive and to fail to pick_up on social cues that dictate appropriate behavior . Andrew May was a gregarious , likable toddler . But when he went_to kindergarten , his boisterous behavior turned_off the other kids . Andrew ' s condition was eventually diagnosed as ADHD , says his mother , Kathryn May of Long_Beach . &quot; He was excluded . He was not invited to birthday_parties . And he was very angry . As a result of those things he sought approval by acting_out , &quot; says May , who founded the Long_Beach chapter of the national group Children and Adults with Attention_Deficit_Disorders . Because peer rejection is so common in children like Andrew , the organization CHADD has been_active in promoting both individual counseling and classroom programs emphasizing good peer relationships , May says . &quot; A child ' s entire perception of themselves is based on their ability to be accepted by their peers , &quot; she says . &quot; Without peer acceptance these ( attention deficit ) kids won ' t make it. &quot; * Bullying or aggressive children may_not realize that no one likes them . In contrast , Coie says , extremely shy children are often aware of their social predicament . &quot; They probably feel the pain of rejection more , &quot; he says . &quot; Often , they are picked on or left_out ; they are the kids who are not as aggressive and do not stand_up for themselves as well. &quot; Other studies , however , have found that withdrawn children simply fail to make an impression on peers . Rather than being overtly accepted or rejected , they are overlooked . Another common characteristic among some rejected children is high intelligence . Judy Hall , magnet coordinator at Canterbury School in Pacoima , was concerned about one child who was rejected year after year . But scholastic tests eventually revealed that he was exceptionally bright . &quot; This child was rejected in every class . He was a whiner and a crier and never would do what the other kids wanted to do . At recess , all_the kids ran the other way . Ultimately , he was tested and shown to be highly gifted , &quot; Hall says . &quot; ( Highly intelligent ) kids are just not much like other kids . These kids learn to entertain themselves because no one else understands them. &quot; Research has found a_few other intriguing clues about what makes a child popular or an outcast . Generally , accepted kids are helpful and considerate of others and follow the rules for peer interaction . One study , for example , showed that the biggest difference between rejected children and popular children is that popular children took the time to find_out what was going_on in a new group situation and attempted to match their behavior to the group . Rejected children don ' t read social cues as well . In addition , Coie believes that the way children handle their own flaws is important . For example , while overweight children may be teased more , it ' s the way they react to the teasing that can determine how they are ultimately accepted by peers . The same is true for children who are inept at games and sports . Children who respond with tears and anger will have a hard_time . Children who respond good-naturedly or with humor do not have the same problem with peers , Coie says . Having a good_sense of humor has greatly helped Fred Nelson , says his mother , Lisa Marie Nelson of Agoura . Fred is unique : He ' s hyperactive , has fragile self-esteem and has unusual interests . But he doesn ' t try to hide who he is . &quot; Fred likes bats , which other kids might think is weird , &quot; Nelson says . &quot; But his teacher has made_a_point of allowing him to show his knowledge about bats to the class . So he had a chance to impress the other kids . Things like that really help. &quot; Rejected children don ' t need the endorsement of their entire class to gain confidence and contentment , Nelson notes . Fred is very happy with one close friend . &quot; He has one good friend who always sticks_up for him , &quot; she says . &quot; We tell Fred : ' Not everyone in the world has to like you. ' &quot; Nevertheless , it ' s important to help a rejected child make even small inroads as soon as possible , experts say . Even by kindergarten , Paley says , &quot; A structure begins to be revealed and will soon be carved in stone. &quot; * Studies show one of the biggest problems rejected kids have is their reputation . In one study , half the children rejected in the fifth grade continued to be rejected by their peers over the next five years . &quot; What this implies is that even if rejected children change their behavior , they may still have a hard_time recovering , &quot; Coie says . But if a rejected child ' s problems are not resolved in elementary_school , he or she will become a teen-ager who has no source of support during the turbulent adolescent years and is at high risk for dropping_out or having major social or psychological problems , Coie says . These repercussions occur because rejected children have been repeatedly denied the chance to learn the social skills necessary to succeed in life . Rejected children need not sacrifice their individuality or unique interests in_order to fit_in , experts note . Over time , rejected children often discover others with interests or personalities similar to their own . &quot; In high_school , the curriculum is so diverse that kids often find niches for themselves and find kids with similar interests , &quot; Coie says . &quot; But the junior_high_school years can be very difficult. &quot; The goal for parents , counselors , therapists and teachers is to spot rejection early and intervene , experts say . When her son was rejected in kindergarten , for example , May read books on rejection then began to teach her son basic social skills . &quot; We role-played different situations before we went_to a friend ' s house while we were in the car . He hated that , but we did_it anyway . And we talked_about things that annoyed people , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s critical that the parent take an active role. &quot; It ' s crucial to remind rejected children of their strong attributes , says John Hall , Judy ' s husband . As one of Los Angeles Unified School District ' s few elementary_school counselors , dealing with rejection is a big part of his job . &quot; I talk to them about their positive side , the good pieces about them , &quot; he says . After dealing with the child alone , Hall often sets_up small groups of children , including the rejected child , to do social skills games , such_as role-playing . The outcast child often learns skills during these encounters and may regain confidence . Studies show that if rejected children anticipate that their playmates might like them , they will behave more appropriately and may indeed become more well liked , Coie says . But , he adds , before a child is allowed back into the peer_group , the peer_group has to change its bias against the child . Because a child ' s reputation among peers can become established so fast , Paley is a leading advocate of pushing children to change their attitudes toward others &quot; who , for whatever reason , are not yet part of the system. &quot; In her book &quot; You can ' t Say You can ' t Play &quot; ( Harvard_University Press , 1992 ) , Paley tells of the rule she instituted among her kindergartners that does not allow a child to be rejected from any aspect of school -- including free play time . &quot; Children everywhere are allowed to treat each other the way no good teacher would ever treat a child , &quot; Paley says . &quot; But adults are ambivalent about peer rejection because we have been taught that , on this ( issue ) , children must make_up their own minds. &quot; With the rule_in place , Paley says , the rejected children quickly gain confidence . Parents of rejected children are eternally grateful to teachers who don ' t allow a child to be shunned , May says . &quot; Oftentimes children can be kind and loving to someone with a visible disability , but they can be cruel and unkind to a child who has nothing visibly wrong but is being a brat , &quot; she says . &quot; But if children understand what another child is going_through , they can be very loving and kind. &quot;</TEXT>
