   <HEADLINE> SCIENTIST AIRS PLAN TO ' DUST ' U.S. BORDER ; IMMIGRATION : PROPOSAL TO USE FLUORESCENT MATERIAL TO HELP DETECT ILLEGAL CROSSERS DRAWS CRITICISM FROM ADVOCATES . INS REACTS CAUTIOUSLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a proposal likely to add_to the angry debate about illegal immigration in California , a well-known scientist is calling_for the U.S. Border_Patrol to sprinkle fluorescent dust at the U.S.-Mexico border in_order to detect and track_down illegal border-crossers . The low-cost , low-tech plan would improve border enforcement dramatically and pose no danger to people &quot; tagged &quot; by the glowing dust , according to an article in today ' s edition of Science magazine . But the somewhat surreal , politically charged image of the U.S._government exposing illegal immigrants to chemicals and then tracking them down with lasers and ultraviolet_lights provoked criticism from immigrants ' advocates Thursday . &quot; It ' s incredible , &quot; said activist Roberto Martinez of the American Friends Service Committee in San Diego . &quot; It ' s like something out of ' The Twilight Zone. ' The symbolism is that these are not humans , that these are insects to be sprayed. &quot; INS officials reacted cautiously to the proposal . Steve McDonald , a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington , said he was aware of the article but knows of no such plans or studies conducted by federal authorities . &quot; There ' s obvious concerns that would have to be looked_at : toxicity , impact on the environment , &quot; McDonald said . &quot; While we would look_at all possibilities to enhance our enforcement operations , we look_at them all_in the perspective of the impact on people , the environment and the community . It ' s nothing we would take lightly. &quot; The author of the article is Bill Wattenburg -- a respected physicist , inventor and radio talk_show host based at Cal State Chico . Wattenburg said Thursday that he and the editors of Science magazine know full well that they are advancing a provocative idea at a sensitive time . Proposition 187 , a ballot measure proposing tough immigration enforcement measures , has intensified the controversy over the issue statewide . Nonetheless , he said , authorities have a responsibility to consider technology that is feasible . And Wattenburg rejected charges that it would be dangerous . &quot; Look_at what they are doing now : you have to chase people with helicopters and dogs , use chain-link fences , &quot; Wattenburg said . &quot; What ' s the difference if you mark them with something that ' s harmless ? . . . There is an enormous range of commonly used , nontoxic , biodegradable substances. &quot; Such fluorescent chemicals have been utilized for identifying currency to guard against theft and marking the hands of voters in the recent South_African elections as well as patrons in nightclubs , Wattenburg said . Some of the materials are also present in medicines . As part of the operation -- which Wattenburg calls &quot; fluorescent tagging of infiltrators &quot; -- tractors or hand-propelled dispensers would lay_down bands of invisible material in highly traversed crossing zones at the border , where passing vehicles and people would pick_up the particles . Agents in planes and vehicles could then track_down illegal crossers and identify them with lasers or ultraviolet_lights that make the particles glow , according to the article . The chemical could be prepared to last for hours or for days , although Wattenburg said the intent would be to detect illegal immigrants close to the border . &quot; I would n ' t suggest you go scour cities with it , &quot; he said . The Border_Patrol , which has long suffered from lack of funds and technology , uses an array of infrared night scopes , closed-circuit cameras and motion sensors . But Wattenburg said his plan could double the agency ' s effectiveness . He said he is prepared to conduct a six-month , $ 500 # 000 experiment in San Diego , where agents make almost half of the million-plus arrests border-wide . Gustavo De La Vina , chief agent of the San Diego sector , said such a decision would have to be made at the highest levels of his agency . &quot; We try to keep an open mind , but there are a lot of sensitivities involved , especially when we are dealing with people who are not involved in criminal activity &quot; other_than illegal crossing . The origins of the proposal only emphasize what Wattenburg readily describes as its &quot; politically explosive &quot; content . It is based on experiments Wattenburg had done to devise methods for detecting enemy guerrilla fighters in Vietnam and , more recently , in Somalia . And it has drawn timid reactions from politicians and government officials , he said . &quot; The INS is being given no help by politicians , &quot; he said . Wattenburg has grown used to the public spotlight , cultivating an image as a thoughtful maverick whose inventions have been heeded by the government on several occasions . His advice played a role in the Pentagon ' s decision last year to change the way it air-dropped supplies into war-torn Bosnia . But he is stepping into treacherous turf with his border enforcement plan . Even if the technology proves harmless , critics say , the concept would spark fierce opposition on both sides of the international line . Martinez said the proposal contributes symbolically to an increasingly harsh and dehumanizing view of immigrants . He cited a recent statement by Rep . Randy Cunningham ( R-San Diego ) , who said illegal border-crossing was &quot; like locusts coming_across down there. &quot; And Martinez said advocate groups would fight tooth and nail to stop implementation of fluorescent dusting . &quot; We would stop it at the proposal stage , &quot; he said . At the other end of the spectrum , a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform said he would like to know more about the potentially powerful enforcement tool . But he said its scope sounds limited . &quot; Certainly it ' s not going_to solve the problem all by itself , &quot; said Ira Mehlman of FAIR . &quot; We are interested in more comprehensive measures , such_as a national Social_Security card . Still the best way is to discourage people from what they want , which is a job. &quot;</TEXT>
