   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL REPORT ; EL MONTE ; CULTURAL CENTER IS SYMBOL OF TAIWANESE CONTROVERSY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s in a name ? Plenty when it comes_to the Chinese Cultural Center in El Monte . Many say the $ 3-million facility built by the Taiwanese government is a haven where overseas Chinese can rekindle ties with their historic culture . But others , who believe Taiwan should be independent of China , see the center as a slap in the face . They want it renamed the Taiwanese Cultural Center to reflect who funded the facility . They also accuse center officials of discriminating against them because of their political views . As evidence , they claim that center officials have not made rooms available when they call to schedule meetings . &quot; They intentionally discourage ( pro-independence ) Taiwanese Americans from using the center ; a lot of us don ' t want to do any activities under that flag , &quot; said Jack Liu of Palos Verdes , president of the Collegiate Alumni Assn . of Taiwan , referring to the Taiwanese flag that adorns the lobby . To draw attention to their concerns , Liu and other pro-independence Taiwanese Americans_planned a press_conference today at a San Gabriel restaurant . Some said they will boycott the center until the name is changed . Daniel Liao , director of the center , denied Liu ' s claim and said the center welcomes all overseas Chinese organizations . He said thousands of Chinese Americans use the center each week to take_out books , hold conferences or learn calligraphy . &quot; We ' re willing to serve people , welcome people , regardless of their political associations , Liao said . &quot; I have no grudge with them . I respect their opinions . But there is a current reality existing . What will happen in the future we can ' t tell. &quot; The debate offers a peek at the political crosscurrents battering Taiwan today , pitting many of the 500 # 000 to 600 # 000 overseas Chinese in Southern California against each other . On one side stand pro-independence Taiwanese Americans such_as Liu who think that Taiwan ' s 21 million people should forget about negotiating a reunification with the People ' s Republic_of_China and declare themselves a free and separate nation . On the other side are Taiwanese Americans such_as Marina Tse , president of the Chinese American Educator ' s Assn . Tse , whose father was a senator in Taiwan , supports the government , which seeks an eventual reunification with mainland_China . Taiwan calls itself the Republic_of_China . Mainland China , under its communist government , is the People ' s Republic_of_China . The feud between the two dates_back 50 years , to when Mao Tse Tung ' s communists fought Chiang Kai-shek ' s Kuomintang party for control of the most populous nation in the world . By 1949 , Mao had won and the Kuomintang fled to Taiwan , where they established a government in exile with the aim of eventually returning to the mainland once communism had been vanquished . They are still waiting .</TEXT>
