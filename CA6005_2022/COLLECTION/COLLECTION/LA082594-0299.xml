   <HEADLINE> THEY GET TOGETHER , BUT NOT ON ISSUES ; BASEBALL : PLAYERS AND OWNERS FINALLY TALK , BUT NO PROGRESS IS REPORTED IN SETTLING STRIKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Players and owners went eye to eye for the first time in baseball ' s stalemated collective_bargaining talks Wednesday , but there was still no indication they are seeing_eye_to_eye . There was no progress and no change of position on Day 13 of the players strike . The talks , however , will resume this morning under the auspices of federal mediators , and both sides seemed to feel that an improved tone was established during a seven-hour meeting in which 12 owners and club executives expressed their need for a new compensation system and five of the 21 players in_attendance -- Paul Molitor , Brett Butler , Curt Schilling , Kevin Brown and Scott Sanderson -- explained their opposition to a salary cap . Said Molitor later : &quot; The owners made some heartfelt and emotional presentations about the economic concerns they feel need to be addressed , but the players said , ' Yes , we know some teams are being squeezed , but we don ' t think this proposal solves the problems. ' &quot; We told them they were asking the players to solve problems ( through the cap ) that they should solve themselves ( through increased revenue sharing not linked to a cap ) . There will be no baseball as long as the cap is_on the table. &quot; Billed as the first negotiating session since the strike began on Aug . 12 , there was no real negotiation , only statements of policy , position and historical perspective . Donald Fehr , executive_director of the Major_League Players Assn. , is said to have spoken_for almost two hours about previous negotiations -- this is the eighth stoppage since 1972 -- and the players ' long fight to win rights and freedom threatened by a proposal that would destroy free_agency and put artificial restraints on a free market . &quot; This was the kind of meeting that you might expect at the preliminary stage of bargaining , several weeks , if not more_than that , before a strike deadline , not 12 days into a strike , &quot; Fehr said at a news_conference , adding that it probably should have been held even before the owners reopened the negotiations a year early , in December of 1992 , and certainly before they made their proposal on May 23 of this year . &quot; It ' s still shaping_up as a very long process , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; There is no indication the owners want a quick resolution. &quot; Owners negotiator Richard Ravitch agreed in part , saying there will be no progress until the players address the owners ' need for cost certainty and the relationship between revenue and compensation . He described the meeting -- interrupted several times when the teams separated to caucus or confer_with the mediators -- as civil and intelligent , but said it did not address those central issues . &quot; Hopefully , that will happen tomorrow , but I don ' t think you can expect any instant changes , &quot; Ravitch said . Nevertheless , some players came_away with a feeling that the owners have begun to show some flexibility regarding the cap . Said Butler , the Dodgers ' assistant player representative : &quot; I didn ' t get the feeling from them that they were saying , ' This is the way it ' s got_to be , ' and that ' s an improvement . I mean , there were some voices raised , and frustration expressed , but I thought it was positive and constructive . After 14 years ( of his involvement in_labor issues ) , it was refreshing to have 12 representatives of the owners across the table. &quot; If that feeling of flexibility is legitimate , it may stem from what seems to be a conscious attempt by the owners to avoid reference_to a salary cap per se , and to draw the union out regarding alternative proposals . Did all 12 owners and executives refer specifically to a cap during their presentations Wednesday ? &quot; Some did and some didn ' t , &quot; said Gene Orza , the union ' s associate general counsel . &quot; Maybe that ' s a good sign. &quot; Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington said the ability to project labor costs by a pre-established link between revenue and compensation &quot; doesn ' t have to come_through a salary cap. &quot; He said there are alternatives based on tax plans and salary scales among other things , and that the owners continue to hope the union will address those . Alternatives ? &quot; A rose by any other name is still a rose , &quot; Fehr said , adding that when the union offered alternatives devoid_of a cap or a defined percentage of revenue going_to salaries , they were quickly rejected by the owners . &quot; Our position has always been that the free market should establish what the players receive , &quot; he said . &quot; If salaries decrease in a free market , so be it . The players are prepared to live with that. &quot; John Calhoun Wells , national director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , commended the owners and players on their &quot; professional and problem solving &quot; deportment as talks resumed , but where it leads is still uncertain .</TEXT>
