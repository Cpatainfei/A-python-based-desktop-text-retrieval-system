   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; INTEL ' S HANDLING OF THE PENTIUM DEFECT CHIPS_AT ITS IMAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Intel Corp. ' s handling of the outcry over the flaw in its Pentium microprocessor is shaping_up as a textbook case of how not to handle a crisis , management experts said Monday . As did Exxon Corp . after the Valdez oil spill and USAir after its recent string of plane crashes , Intel is turning a difficult but isolated problem into one that threatens long-term damage to the company ' s reputation . &quot; Everybody will have a crisis sooner or later . The key is how you respond and accept responsibility , &quot; says Ian Mitroff , director of the USC Center for Crisis Management . &quot; I don ' t think they ' ve done very well. &quot; Intel ' s bungling began when it discovered the flaw in the Pentium last summer and decided not to tell anyone , reasoning that the flaw would affect hardly anyone and that it was all but commonplace for a complex microprocessor to have a_few bugs . After a Virginia mathematics professor discovered and publicized the flaw , however , Intel ' s secrecy looked suspiciously like a cover-up . Then , when it was forced to acknowledge the problem , Intel dismissed the chances of its causing problems for the average user as exceedingly rare -- once in 27 # 000 years . Bad move , say crisis management experts . Statistics are a classic defense in such situations , but they are unpersuasive at best and genuinely misleading at worst . &quot; Probabilities are always off , &quot; says Mitroff , pointing_out that few believed Exxon ' s claim after the Valdez spill that such an accident would happen only once in 250 years . Intel ' s statements are already looking suspect now that IBM has concluded that a Pentium user could encounter problems as often as once every 24 days . Another blunder : Intel has offered to replace the chip only in cases in which it believes the flaw could cause a problem -- a classic case of focusing_on the short-term problems caused by the crisis rather than on the more important long-term issues . &quot; They should take ( the chips ) back , no questions asked , &quot; says Larry Kamer , a San Francisco public relations executive . &quot; They have a good , solid reputation that they have spent years and millions of dollars to develop . that ' s the equity they have to protect. &quot; By refusing to replace the chips for any customer who asks -- especially when Compaq and IBM have both offered to do so -- Intel &quot; comes_across as the bad_guy , &quot; Kamer says . The Pentium debacle is following the path of the classic &quot; crisis &quot; as described by David Umansky , a crisis management expert in Baltimore . He says a crisis begins with a surprise occurrence , develops in an atmosphere of insufficient information , results in an increasing flow of events , loss of control , siege mentality , intense scrutiny from the outside and short-term focus . The critical action required of Intel , Umansky says , is to be more open and communicative about its view of the situation . &quot; If you ' re not , you ' re leaving the media to say what the problem is and what should be done about it. &quot; &quot; It ' s almost irrelevant what Intel says . If IBM thinks it ' s a problem , it ' s a problem , &quot; Mitroff says . Already there are signs that the problem is undermining Intel ' s reputation , just as the company is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build a brand image among consumers . On the Internet and elsewhere in computing circles , the jokes are flying . One refers to the widely displayed &quot; Intel Inside &quot; logos on PCs that use Intel chips . Goes the line : &quot; Intel Inside , can ' t Divide. &quot; * More Computer News * The TimesLink on-line service includes a large selection of other recent articles and information about Computers &amp; Technology in its Business section .
