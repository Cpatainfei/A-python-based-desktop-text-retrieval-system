   <HEADLINE> EXTENSION OF CHINA ' S TRADE STATUS IS GOOD NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA ; ECONOMY : STATE IS_ON THE FRONT_LINES OF COMMERCE WITH THAT COUNTRY IN ENTERPRISES WORTH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California companies , selling everything from $ 10 Fred Flintstone dolls to $ 100-million jetliners , avoided a major setback Thursday as President Clinton renewed preferential trade status for China . &quot; It ' s very good news , &quot; said Robert Solomon , chairman of Dakin Inc. , a Woodland Hills-based marketer of the Flintstone dolls and other toys , half of which are made in China . &quot; I only see the potential there becoming greater. &quot; Mark Schlansky , manager of commercial aircraft at Douglas Aircraft Co . in Long_Beach , said , &quot; Now business can get_down to doing business and making long-range plans and commitments &quot; in China . The President extended &quot; most favored nation &quot; trading status to China while severing the link between China ' s trade benefits and human_rights issues . His action removed the threat that China -- had it been denied the trade privileges -- would retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs and other costs on U.S. companies that sell to China or import Chinese-made goods . California firms -- notably those involved in aerospace , agriculture , computers , electronics , apparel and chemicals -- are_on the front_lines of trade with China , which has a population of 1.1 billion . A trade war would have been a major blow to the state ' s fledgling economic recovery , some executives said . Companies still willing to import goods from China would have been forced to pass along the higher tariffs to U.S. consumers , they said . Chinese retaliation would also have jeopardized at least $ 1.7 billion worth of California exports to China , representing 35 # 000 jobs , according to the Business Coalition for U.S.-China Trade , a group of about 400 California firms that urged Clinton to maintain China ' s trade status . Clinton ' s decision &quot; certainly will improve the commercial environment ( in China ) for California firms , &quot; said Richard Brecher , a director of the U.S.-China Business Council , a trade group in Washington . The action won ' t immediately translate into more jobs for Californians , but &quot; as California businesses become more involved and understand the Chinese market , it ' s going_to make a tremendous difference in terms of jobs here , &quot; said Winston Elton , a trade specialist in San Diego with the accounting_firm KPMG Peat Marwick . Nearly 1 # 000 American companies overall urged Clinton to renew China ' s MFN status , which enables China to export goods to the United States at reduced tariffs . China sold $ 30 billion worth of goods to the United States last year , while U.S. exports to China totaled $ 8.8 billion . Aerospace firms , in particular , leaned_on the President not to revoke China ' s trade benefits , saying in a letter to Clinton that such a move would be devastating to their already beleaguered industry . The nation ' s largest exporter , Seattle-based Boeing Co. , which relies_on dozens of California-based suppliers to provide parts for its airliners , was a major proponent of maintaining China ' s MFN status . Clinton ' s decision came_on the same day Boeing confirmed that it is talking with &quot; a number of airlines in China , &quot; including Air China , about potential major sales of new aircraft . &quot; Certainly the decision on MFN removes a major barrier , &quot; Boeing spokesman David Jensen said . But he said it would be premature to speculate on any orders . Lawrence W . Clarkson , Boeing ' s vice_president for planning and international development , hailed Clinton ' s decision , noting that China &quot; is Boeing ' s fastest-growing market today &quot; and that China already buys one of every seven jets built by the company . Boeing ' s big Southern California subcontractors include Northrop Grumman Corp . in Los Angeles . China is also important to Douglas Aircraft , the jetliner unit of St . Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp . Among other things , Douglas this year will begin exporting kits for the assembly of 40 passenger jets in Shanghai as part of a co-production program with Chinese companies . &quot; The China market is extremely critical for Southern California ( because ) the commercial aircraft market has been in a deep downturn , &quot; said Douglas ' Schlansky . Douglas and Boeing estimate China will need between $ 40 billion and $ 65 billion worth of new airplanes over the next two decades . Clinton ' s move was also hailed by Hughes Aircraft Co . in Los Angeles , which Wednesday announced a joint_venture with Chinese companies to invest $ 100 million to $ 150 million over the next few years to manufacture and sell satellite receiving stations . &quot; We see China as a valuable market , particularly in the telecommunications realm , &quot; Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said , adding that the company expects China to spend about $ 1 billion on communications satellite systems alone over the next decade .
