   <HEADLINE> U.S. LAWMAKERS RENEW WARNING TO NORTH_KOREA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a breakdown in talks between a U.N. team and North_Korea , U.S. lawmakers issued new warnings Sunday about the consequences if Pyongyang does not agree to international monitoring to prevent development of a nuclear_weapons program . Calling the defense of South_Korea a &quot; sacred obligation , &quot; Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) said the North_Korean government ' s brinkmanship could ultimately endanger its survival . Pyongyang &quot; should make no mistake about our dedication , our intention and our absolute firmness in continuing the course of making_sure they do not become a nuclear_weapons state , &quot; Nunn said on NBC ' s &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; Tensions heightened over the weekend when North_Korea announced that it will continue unloading spent fuel at its main Yongbyon nuclear_reactor but would &quot; never allow &quot; the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the facility to determine whether fuel has been secretly diverted from energy to weapons use . North_Korea has repeatedly denied that it has any form of nuclear_weapons program , but U.S. intelligence agencies believe that enough enriched plutonium has been siphoned_off to make one or two crude bombs . After talks broke_down Saturday , part of the IAEA team left North_Korea , abruptly ending the latest effort in the 16-month crisis that has swung erratically between near-calamity and tentative cooperation . The collapse could open the way for punitive U.N. economic sanctions , which North_Korea has said it will treat as an act of war . &quot; We don ' t want a war , &quot; added Nunn , who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . But &quot; if North_Korea brings a war in reaction to any kind of sanctions , then they will bring_about the destruction of_their_own country. &quot; For months , the Clinton_Administration has tried a carrot-and-stick strategy to engage the Communist state , offering diplomatic and economic incentives in exchange for cooperation on its nuclear program . Pyongyang ' s latest actions indicate that tactic may have failed . Nunn said Pyongyang faces three alternatives -- and three different responses : First , cooperation , which would be rewarded with membership in the family of nations through &quot; trade and intercourse. &quot; Second , resisting nuclear_weapons monitoring , which would cause &quot; a very serious financial situation , which could lead to their own disintegration. &quot; And third , aggression , which would bring military defeat . &quot; The North_Koreans are playing brinkmanship -- this is their historical pattern -- but playing this game has very dangerous consequences , &quot; he added . Saying there are still methods of avoiding military confrontation , Sen . Bill Bradley ( D-N.J. ) suggested that the Clinton_Administration exert pressure through Japan ' s economic ties and China ' s energy links . &quot; So you have two vises right there that can begin to squeeze , that might indeed take_place if there were ever economic sanctions voted at the U.N. against North_Korea , &quot; he said , also on &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; U.N. Security_Council members met Friday to discuss the standoff , and more talks are scheduled at the United Nations on Tuesday . After the holiday weekend , the Clinton_Administration is expected to have to rethink its tactics on North_Korea ' s nuclear program . On Friday , the crisis appeared to take_on new urgency when the IAEA , the U.N. nuclear monitoring agency , notified the Security_Council that North_Korea was removing the reactor ' s fuel rods so quickly that evidence of diverting fuel to a weapons program could be erased &quot; within days. &quot; International concern mounted further over the weekend with reports_out of Japan that North_Korea may soon test an advanced version of the Rodong 1 missile , which could reach most of western Japan . Military analysts believe that the missile would be capable of carrying a nuclear_warhead if it were refitted for that purpose .</TEXT>
