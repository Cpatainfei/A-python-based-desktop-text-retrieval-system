   <HEADLINE> JAPAN , SOUTH_KOREA SEEK TO END MISTRUST ; ASIA : BOTH LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AT AN INTRANSIGENT NORTH_KOREA . HOSOKAWA SAYS JAPAN WILL NOT DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a looming threat to both countries from North_Korea ' s potential development of nuclear_weapons , Japan and South_Korea on Thursday focused their principal attention on removing mistrust and bitterness from their own relationship . The occasion was a visit by President Kim Young Sam , who arrived for a three-day stay before going_on to China . Mindful of continuing Korean mistrust of Japan after a 1910-45 Japanese colonial rule , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered Kim an unsolicited assurance that , even if Communist North_Korea armed itself with nuclear_weapons , Japan , as the only nation to suffer nuclear attacks , would never follow_suit . Emperor Akihito , at a black-tie banquet for Kim and his wife at the Imperial Palace , added an apology for &quot; the numerous immense sufferings . . . which my country inflicted . . . on the people of the Korean_Peninsula &quot; during Japanese rule . &quot; I have expressed my deep sadness over this fact some years ago , and my feelings have not changed , &quot; the emperor added in an unusually long toast . This was the first time an emperor had apologized without diplomatic negotiations in_advance . Hosokawa ' s nuclear demurral was his second . He made a similar statement when he visited Washington in February . North_Korea , in an apparent bid to justify its suspected nuclear development , has pointed repeatedly to Japan ' s use of plutonium in its nuclear_power plants as &quot; proof &quot; that Japan ultimately will develop nuclear weaponry . Plutonium can be used to make a nuclear bomb . Last Nov . 10 , just four days after a meeting in South_Korea with Hosokawa , Kim declared in an interview with The Times that he feared that Japan would go nuclear if North_Korea did . Kim responded to the emperor with a mild admonition that Japan must &quot; squarely face the past just as it happened and earnestly learn its lessons. &quot; But once that is done , South_Korea and Japan can &quot; enter a new era of strong neighborly ties . . . . We must_not let our past shackle our future , &quot; he said . In a speech he delivered today before Parliament , Kim proposed that &quot; we close this century of strife and friction and open a new era of genuine bilateral friendship and cooperation. &quot; Hosokawa and Kim agreed to continue close cooperation with the United States to persuade North_Korea to abandon nuclear development and allow full international inspections of its nuclear facilities . But Kim warned that &quot; there is a limit to our patience &quot; with North_Korean delaying tactics . Hosokawa , for his part , reiterated a pledge to act &quot; with responsibility &quot; to carry_out any sanctions the U.N. Security_Council might impose on North_Korea . Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Sato said in a speech that Japan should be prepared even to revise its laws , if necessary , to carry_out its part of any sanctions . At issue if sanctions are imposed is how Japan would halt the flow of an estimated $ 600 million worth of remittances to North_Korea made by Korean residents sympathetic to the Stalinist regime . &quot; The countries who are the recipients of the threat posed by the North_Korea nuclear problem are South_Korea and Japan . If Japan failed to implement completely U.N. sanctions , it would be branded an irresponsible nation , &quot; Sato said . A mistake in handling the North_Korean nuclear issue , he added , &quot; would invite the isolation of Japan in international society. &quot; Hosokawa was expected to face opposition from the Socialist_Party , his largest coalition partner that maintains friendly ties with North_Korea , if attempts are made to halt the flow of money to Pyongyang .</TEXT>
