   <HEADLINE> 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOON LANDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As I write this , it ' s been 25 years to the day since the first man set foot on the moon . Sadly , the U.S. space_program has taken a &quot; giant leap &quot; backward since that historic occasion . Even now , Congress is still trying to slash NASA ' s budget and cancel the Space_Station entirely , to_the_point where NASA , as your editorial noted ( July 20 ) , is left wondering whether Congress and the President really want a space_program at all . Where is all that money we supposedly saved by cutting_back the defense budget drastically at the end of the Cold_War ? Why couldn ' t some of that money be used to advance the space_program and keep some aerospace workers employed ? The knowledge we have gained from the space_program is invaluable , going_far beyond the bounds of space exploration itself . Why are we throwing it all away ? DENNIS F . HANRAHAN , La Habra * The story of the celebration at the White_House of the 25th anniversary of man ' s first walk on the moon appears inside your paper ! I looked_to see what stories appeared on the front page . Of course there were extremely important stories there but can the story about a wife suing her ex-husband for a share of his lottery winnings possibly be considered more important than the anniversary of the first moon walk ? Unfortunately , not only the newspaper but the evening news on commercial television brushed_off the anniversary with a story so brief that if you blinked , you missed it . Public television presented the full speech of Neil Armstrong and enough coverage that one could grasp the significance and flavor of the celebration taking_place in the White_House . KCET marked the occasion with two full hours of excellent programming on the Apollo missions . In your story a 12-year-old girl who was present at the White_House ceremony was quoted as saying , &quot; At first , I didn ' t really believe people could go_to the moon. &quot; It seems obvious she hadn ' t realized that people already had done so and it seems equally obvious why she may_not have known . EILEEN SCHULTZ , San Marino * What was the first word uttered from the surface of the moon ? Most of the sound-bite- happy TV retrospectives cut Neil Armstrong ' s first two syllables before his dramatic &quot; . . . Tranquility Base here . The Eagle has landed. &quot; The missing word is &quot; Houston. &quot; But thanks to TimesLink and a_few other sources , a number of us with a special_interest in historical accuracy on both moon and Earth can repeatedly confirm this significant bit of space trivia -- with pride . ALVIN HOUSTON LAWSON , Garden Grove * Astronaut Neil Armstrong , the first man to step_on the moon_on July 20 , 1969 , wanted to spend the evening of the 25th anniversary of that event at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics banquet in Los Angeles , where 500 people gathered to pay tribute to the contractors and subcontractors who designed and built the wondrous Apollo 11 . The White_House even advanced the time of its ceremony honoring Armstrong , Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins for Armstrong to fly to Los Angeles for the banquet . But there was a problem with the flight and he could not make_it in time for the banquet . So it is ironical that in 1969 , he boarded a spacecraft that got him to the moon as planned , but in 1994 , an airline could not get him to Los Angeles on schedule . How times have changed .
