   <HEADLINE> SURVIVORS BATTLE BREAST_CANCER WITH AWARENESS ; HEALTH : WOMEN WHO HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE DISEASE STRESS EARLY DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS AS THE KEYS IN LOCAL RALLIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dolly Montalvo will always remember her 45th birthday -- it was the day she was told she had breast_cancer . &quot; It was not a nice birthday_present , &quot; she said . Each year , 420 women in Ventura County find_out they have breast_cancer . The American Cancer Society estimates 100 of those women will die from the disease . The numbers may be depressing , but the survival rate is much higher now than it was 10 years ago , said Dr. Ann Kelley , chief of medicine at Ventura County Medical_Center . After marching Saturday with a small group from the Futurecare Cancer Treatment Center in Oxnard to the Esplanade Mall , Kelley joined Montalvo and about 50 other people at a rally in the mall to inform women about breast_cancer and announce that October is Breast_Cancer Awareness Month . A similar event was held Saturday in the east county , where participants marched from the Westlake Comprehensive Cancer Center to rally at a nearby park in Westlake Village . Organizers chose the theme &quot; Break the Silence &quot; for the event . Despite their efforts to talk to women in the mall Saturday afternoon , many didn ' t want to listen . While children stared at the pink balloons and carnations , most women ignored the information booths and pushed strollers past the podium . &quot; People are scared to talk_about this , &quot; said Rita Mendoza , a 57-year-old cancer survivor from Oxnard . &quot; It ' s too real for them. &quot; So Mendoza and Montalvo , both members of the Oxnard-based Latina Breast_Cancer Survivors , left the booth and shoved leaflets into the hands of shoppers who were walking past the tables . Montalvo , who found a cancerous lump while examining herself in the shower , said people still think_of a cancer diagnosis as a death sentence . * But she ' s proof that it ' s not . &quot; I ' m a six-year survivor , going_on seven , &quot; said Montalvo , now 52 , an office-skills instructor at Oxnard College . &quot; When I told my family , they were devastated . It ' s just like when someone dies , people don ' t know what to say . Cancer is synonymous with death , but it doesn ' t have to be any more. &quot; Now she uses her sense_of_humor to educate others . While tending a prosthesis booth Saturday , Montalvo told a small group of customers , &quot; The only thing you can ' t do after surgery is be a topless dancer or nurse a child. &quot; While humor helps Montalvo talk_about breast_cancer , some women are reluctant to discuss it at all . &quot; Some women find a lump and they are too scared to go_to the doctor , &quot; said Karen Wright , an administrator at Futurecare Cancer Treatment Center . &quot; We ' re trying to create a sense of urgency , a sense of hope for women so they will do self-examinations that will lead to early diagnosis and to treatment. &quot; Kelley said misinformation is as dangerous as the silence that has always surrounded cancer , especially breast_cancer . While she advocates a good diet and exercise for all patients , she said studies are divided on whether those factors alone can prevent cancer . And other medical breakthroughs , such_as the recent discovery of a breast_cancer gene , raise new problems . &quot; Tracking of the gene will benefit women with a family history of the disease , &quot; she said , &quot; but insurance_companies could also use gene testing to deny coverage to some women . There ' s a lot of questions that will need to be addressed. &quot; * Kelley advocates using gene testing to give &quot; psychological relief &quot; to women with a history of cancer in their families . But she emphasized that the only way a cure for cancer will be found is through research , which she called &quot; tragically underfunded. &quot; &quot; It ' s not fast enough and it ' s not good_enough , but we ' re working on it , &quot; she said . &quot; Women should know that treatment is there and it ' s getting better all_of the time. &quot; Montalvo , who has had two biopsies , a mastectomy and six months of chemotherapy , said a supportive family may be the most important factor . &quot; You need them just to be there to hug you when you need a hug , or to mop_up the buckets of tears , &quot; she said . &quot; My husband loves me for me , not for my body_parts . I hate to say this , but some husbands just can ' t handle it and I worry about those women . I think my scar is beautiful. &quot;</TEXT>
