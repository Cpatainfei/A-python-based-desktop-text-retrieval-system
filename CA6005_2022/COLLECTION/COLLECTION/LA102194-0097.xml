   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : COLLEGE DISTRICT OPPOSES PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trustees of the Los Angeles Community_College District , where minorities compose nearly three-quarters of the 104 # 000 students , have joined the growing roster of local public officials and groups to oppose Proposition 187 , the controversial immigration initiative . By a 6-0 vote Wednesday night , the district ' s Board of Trustees went_on record opposing the Nov . 8 ballot measure that , among other restrictions , would deny illegal immigrants access to the state ' s public colleges and universities . &quot; In a nutshell , folks , Proposition 187 is a demagogue ' s dream , &quot; said Trustee David Lopez-Lee , a USC professor who sponsored the board ' s resolution . Lopez-Lee also blasted Gov . Pete Wilson for supporting the measure , which Lopez-Lee said &quot; appeals_to the basest of emotions. &quot; Lopez-Lee complained that the measure would discriminate against legal Asian and Latino residents because they would be the most likely ones to have their citizenship status challenged . And he charged that federal_officials have never fully enforced existing federal provisions against hiring illegals . At present , the state ' s community_colleges generally accept illegal immigrants as students , although they pay the same higher fees as non-California residents . The Los Angeles district asks students if they are U . S . citizens , but only for the purpose of determining fees . Under the measure , the community_colleges , Cal State and University of California systems would be required to verify the citizenship status of new and existing students beginning in the spring , and would have to report suspected illegal immigrants to authorities . Proponents of the so-called &quot; Save Our State &quot; measure argue that illegal immigrants should not have access to publicly subsidized college educations . The measure would also bar illegal immigrants from a range of other state- and county-funded benefits , including non-emergency health_care . JOHN CHANDLER</TEXT>
