   <HEADLINE> ROYAL VISIT GIVES SHOW OF RESPECT ; COMMUNITIES : TOURS REFLECT THE STRIDES LOS ANGELES IMMIGRANTS HAVE MADE IN BUILDING CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS . MANY SEE IT AS A COMING-OF-AGE PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Japanese Emperor Hirohito visited here in 1975 , he dined with 500 notables at the Music Center , but he did not travel down 1st Street to visit Little Tokyo . This week , however , his son , Akihito , has gone_out of his way to pay his respects_to the Japanese American community . Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko have called_on the many institutions the community has built_in the two decades since Hirohito visited -- a massive cultural center and theater complex , a nationally prominent history museum , and a retirement home complete with an elaborate Japanese garden . At each stop , they have expressed understanding of the hardships and appreciation of the achievements of immigrants from Japan . Many Japanese Americans say they consider this visit a kind of coming-of-age party for a community that has struggled for more_than a century for acceptance in America -- and for respect from Japan . &quot; It ' s like a stamp of approval . . . a total acceptance and recognition of what we ' ve achieved up_to now , &quot; said Bruce Kaji , a real_estate developer and founding president of the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo . &quot; It ' s a tremendous opportunity for Japanese to see what Japanese Americans have had to suffer , how we ' ve overcome and how we ' ve succeeded. &quot; Japanese Americans say they have often felt that Japanese nationals looked down on them for their peasant origins and for their relative ignorance of Japanese culture . They watched their mom-and-pop stores squeezed_out of Little Tokyo by big Japanese corporations . But in recent years , they have learned to work with Japanese companies to raise money for community institutions . And the success of Japanese Americans in mainstream American institutions , from universities to law_firms to Congress , has helped gain the respect of Japanese nationals . The visit of the royal couple to the community before departing Wednesday for San Francisco meant different things to different generations . Ninety-two-year-old Fujie Goto , who grew_up in Hawaii and worked as a maid and laundress much of her life , was moved to tears when she shook the hands of the royal couple at her retirement home_in Boyle Heights . &quot; Aren ' t they sweet ? . . . To think that people like that can talk so nice to you , &quot; Goto said . But most young Japanese Americans have little interest in Japan and simply consider the emperor and empress foreign dignitaries , said Michael Okamura , a fourth-generation Californian . Nonetheless , Okamura , a 32-year-old banker , said he appreciated the chance to meet them at the history museum : &quot; It was great to have that connection again after so many generations. &quot; At the museum , the emperor and empress viewed the wicker_baskets in which emigrants from Japan packed their clothes at the turn_of_the_century . They saw the bullwhips and short-handled hoes that marked the harsh lives of the plantation workers , and photos of &quot; picture brides &quot; sent to meet husbands in America . They viewed a model of the U.S. internment_camp at Manzanar where thousands of Japanese Americans were incarcerated without due_process during World_War_II , and the computers with which families can look_up the internment history of their relatives . They lingered at each exhibit , seeming reluctant to be led away by their guide . Afterward , they talked with museum trustees , including Francis Sogi , a partner with the law_firm Kelley Drye &amp; Warren , and with Henry Ota , a lawyer and partner in Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro . * For first- and second-generation Japanese Americans , most of them older than the emperor , his visit brought_back memories of the values of their parents . Asked about those values , some issei and nisei began murmuring in Japanese the Imperial Rescript on Education -- a list of moral imperatives issued by Akihito ' s grandfather , Emperor Meiji , in 1890 and memorized by Japanese children on both sides of the Pacific for decades afterward . To Americans , this pledge of allegiance to Confucian values -- and the emperor -- was seen as a prescription for emperor worship and imperialist fanaticism , and it was abolished by the occupying forces after Japan ' s defeat . But to older Japanese Americans , most of its exhortations seem exemplary : Be dutiful to your parents , true_to your friends , study hard , cultivate the arts and work for the public good . &quot; We ' ve lost that , &quot; said Yoshiko Sakurai , 76 , a second-generation Japanese American . &quot; Countries don ' t have moral education anymore. &quot; Hitoshi Sameshima , 73 , said the visit of the emperor has reminded him that it was only recently that he has come_to understand what his parents were trying to teach him about the essential Japanese values of gaman , giri and on -- perseverance , duty and obligation . The younger generation seems to have rejected these values in favor of outspoken demands for their rights , he said . It all came_home to him recently when his daughter was pulled over by police while he was riding with her in her car . To his amazement , she argued with the police_officer , refused to sign the ticket , and later fought the citation in court -- successfully . &quot; I thought , oh my God , in my generation you ' d sign the ticket right away , &quot; Sameshima said . He said it is a good thing the younger generation is more assertive , but he is still a bit nostalgic for some of the old values . &quot; Our parents brought all that over and tried to instill it in us , &quot; he said . &quot; But as the generations move_on it fades away. &quot;</TEXT>
