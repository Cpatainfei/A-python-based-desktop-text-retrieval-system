   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187 ; ASIAN AMERICAN GROUPS ORGANIZE TO FIGHT MEASURE ; ACTIVISTS SAY THIS IS THE FIRST ISSUE TO DRAW SUCH A GRASS-ROOTS RESPONSE . STILL , THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR DENYING SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The campaign to defeat Proposition 187 has spawned an unprecedented grass-roots movement in California ' s diverse Asian American communities , bringing politically savvy third-generation Chinese and Japanese Americans working side_by_side with newer Korean , Vietnamese , Thai and Cambodian immigrants . &quot; Even though this is the most insidious , mean-spirited initiative , it really provides us with an organizing opportunity , &quot; said Miya Iwataki , co-chairwoman of Californians United Against Proposition 187 . The Nov . 8 ballot measure would prohibit health , education and social_services for illegal immigrants . Iwataki and other veteran activists in Southern and Northern California say this is the first time a statewide ballot measure has generated such interest in the Asian American community , which has a statewide population of more_than 2.8 million . They hope that the campaign ' s legacy will be a united Asian American political bloc that can translate into political clout . Not all Asian Americans oppose the so-called &quot; save our state &quot; initiative on the November ballot . Although they may_not be vocal or organized , many Asian Americans_plan to vote for Proposition 187 and believe that the measure will benefit them . Their rationale is no different from the measure ' s other supporters . They say California cannot afford to continue providing services to people who are here illegally when the state_government and residents are struggling in these financially strapped times . And , they add , the policy makes a mockery of the law . &quot; It ' s like saying , ' Hey , break the law , come_into our country and we ' ll provide you all_the services you need , ' &quot; said Gary Kim , president of the Korea American Republican Assn . of Los Angeles . &quot; People tend to see this as a race issue . But I see it as what is right and what is wrong. &quot; Chet Wong , a Chinese American teacher who was born in Los Angeles , compares illegal immigrants to unarmed invaders . &quot; We ' re being invaded across our borders , and the federal_government is not doing anything about it , &quot; he said . To date , the only organized Asian American group pushing Proposition 187 seems to be Asian Americans for Border Control in Sylmar . Spokesman Gil Wong says illegal immigrants are unfairly taking_advantage of American resources . His 10-member group is part of the bigger Orange County-based California Coalition for Immigration Reform . Wong added that Asian American organizations and activists opposing the initiative are acting_out of self-interest . Social_workers , lawyers , health_care_providers and teachers have a financial stake in having illegal immigrants , he said . &quot; They would n ' t have their jobs if there were no illegal immigrants . But the taxpayers are not in the business of giving them job security. &quot; On the other side , hundreds of volunteers and more_than 60 organizations -- ranging from the venerable Chinese American Citizens Alliance and Japanese American Citizens League to the younger Thai Community Development and United Cambodian Community -- form Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187 , the Asian contingent of Californians United Against Proposition 187 . In Los Angeles , organizers have targeted about 30 # 000 Asian American voters in heavily Asian communities . Volunteers , many of them students from area universities , are working the phones in the evenings to reach Asian American voters and encourage them to vote against Proposition 187 . According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates , Asians made_up less than 10 % of the more_than 1.1 million illegal immigrants living_in California in 1992 . Two-thirds of the 100 # 000 illegal immigrants from Asia were Filipinos . The legal_status of Asians is not the issue , opponents say . &quot; We ' re all going_to be affected whether we ' re illegal immigrants or we ' ve been born and raised here , as long as we ' re racially and ethnically visible people_of_color , &quot; said Iwataki , a third-generation Japanese American . &quot; If we look Asian , if we speak with an accent , we ' re going to be asked to provide documentation. &quot; Quynh Tram Nguyen , a Vietnamese who came_to California legally as a refugee in 1984 , says it is unfair to dismiss the contributions of newer arrivals to the state ' s work_force -- even if they are in the country illegally . Chanchanit Martorell , executive_director of the Thai Community_Center , the only service_agency for Thais in Los Angeles , says Proposition 187 would hurt her clients because many have overstayed their visas after coming here as tourists . Meanwhile , the United Cambodian Community organization is campaigning to defeat the measure even though most Cambodians have legal refugee status , said Vora Kanthoul , executive_director of the group . Based in Long_Beach , where an estimated 35 # 000 Cambodians live , the organization believes that the initiative could have the effect of picking on all people who look foreign and do not speak English well , he said . Volunteers for Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187 have used such major community functions as Nisei Week in Little Tokyo in August , the Moon Festival in Chinatown in September and the Korean Parade in Koreatown this month to spread the word . Last month , after two naturalization ceremonies at the Los Angeles Convention Center , volunteers registered 1 # 600 new voters -- half of them Asian . Two hundred volunteers are expected to attend the next two naturalization events Oct . 20 and 21 to sign_up more voters . Asians , who are 10 % of California ' s population , make_up about 5 % of the state ' s registered voters . In Los Angeles County , more_than 700 # 000 people with Asian Pacific Islander surnames are eligible to vote , but only a fourth are registered voters , according to Nancy Au , president of the Asian Pacific Planning Council . The immediate goal of Asian Pacific Islanders Against Proposition 187 is to defeat it . But the activists ' bigger dream is to use this campaign as a vehicle to organize and educate the disparate Asian communities whose differences between them have been more pronounced than their similarities . Because a majority of Asians in the United States arrived in the 1970s and 1980s , many are unaware of the history of legally sanctioned discrimination against Asians , Proposition 187 opponents say . &quot; The first undocumented immigrants were Chinese , not Mexicans , &quot; said Bill Tamayo , an immigration lawyer with the Asian Law Caucus in San Francisco , referring to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that barred Chinese laborers . This and subsequent statutes aimed at the Chinese were the only immigration laws in U.S. history directed at a specific nationality . Asians have a duty to share this history with Latinos , who have become the latest target of the immigrant bashing , Proposition 187 opponents say .</TEXT>
