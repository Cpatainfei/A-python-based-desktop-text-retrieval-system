   <HEADLINE> NIXON IGNORES YELTSIN SNUB , SAYS ' I REMAIN HIS FRIEND ' ; RUSSIA : FORMER PRESIDENT WAS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING GAFFE BY MEETING FIRST WITH OPPOSITION FIGURE RUTSKOI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ignoring a public snub , former U.S. President Richard Nixon said Thursday that his friendship and support for Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin remain untarnished . &quot; I came here as his friend and I remain his friend . I wish him well , &quot; Nixon said at a reception in his honor given by the U.S. ambassador . No high-ranking Russian official attended . A day earlier , an angry Yeltsin had announced that neither he nor any member of his government would receive the 81-year-old former President , one of Yeltsin ' s earliest supporters . Yeltsin aides said Thursday that Nixon ' s transgression was meeting with opposition leaders before first paying his respects_to Yeltsin . Especially offensive to Yeltsin was Nixon ' s Monday meeting with former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi , who was recently released from jail after being accused of treason in attempting to overthrow Yeltsin last October . Rutskoi now intends to run_for president of Russia . &quot; The president was absolutely right not to receive Nixon because the latter ' s schedule initially contained disrespect to Russian statehood , &quot; Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev said in a television interview . &quot; The problem is not that he met with representatives of the opposition , or people who are closer to criminals , to my mind , than to the opposition . The problem is that he did_it wrong , in the wrong order , ignoring courtesy and tact. &quot; But Nixon aide Dmitri K . Simes said it was the Yeltsin administration that had suggested the dates for Nixon ' s visit ; then , at the last moment , officials said Yeltsin would not be able to see Nixon until the very end of his trip . As if to further aggravate Russian-Western relations , Russian authorities Thursday arrested a man who they said was a German spy , the Interfax news_agency reported , citing &quot; a well-informed source. &quot; The arrest could not be confirmed , and no other details were available . If that report is true , the arrest would be the latest salvo in a new espionage war between Russia and the West that began last month with the American arrest of CIA official Aldrich H . Ames and his wife on charges of spying for Moscow . At the reception Thursday night , Nixon , the picture of diplomacy , steered clear of these sore spots and took pains to soothe Russia ' s wounded superpower pride . Nixon took_issue with recent suggestions that Russia is no longer a great_power to be reckoned with . &quot; Russia is a great_power , has been in the past and will be in the future , &quot; he said . Russia and the United States will continue to have differences , he said , but they will be more like the frictions between the Americans and Britain or France . &quot; The differences will be between friends , &quot; he said . Nixon also reminisced about previous visits to Moscow . Traffic , he said , is much fiercer than when he stayed in the Kremlin as the guest of Soviet leader Leonid I . Brezhnev . &quot; It ' s worse than the Santa Ana Freeway , &quot; he said . It is still unclear whether Nixon will meet with ultranationalist leader Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky .</TEXT>
