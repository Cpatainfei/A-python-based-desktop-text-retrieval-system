   <HEADLINE> ' THREE STRIKES ' LAW AND PIZZA CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Pizza Case Unlikely Focus of ' 3 Strikes ' Debate , &quot; Sept . 18 : Jerry Dewayne Williams , the man who stole the pizza from the children at the Redondo Beach Pier , has proven himself incapable of functioning in society . After four felony convictions , is there any doubt as_to what he is ? This will be his fifth felony conviction . At 27 years old , he has many_more years ahead of him to damage society , unless he is locked_up now . JOHN CROWLEY Redondo Beach * &quot; Life ? For a piece of pizza ? &quot; says Williams ' girlfriend . Williams , who takes drugs , robs , frightens children and chronically commits felonies with no apparent problem , but who faints if he eats pork , should get his values straight . If the thought of taking drugs , robbing , etc . made him faint or ill , like it does decent people , then he would n ' t be in this mess with &quot; three strikes. &quot; LAWRENCE PURCELL Echo Park * Reading about the &quot; pizza thief &quot; and similar cases makes two things &quot; strikingly &quot; clear : First , a &quot; three strikes &quot; law for serious felons is good and , second , that we either need to redraw the definitions of misdemeanor and felony or , more probably , create a new classification of crime -- something between a felony and a misdemeanor . People who steal a slice of pizza , or an apple from the store , realistically are not as bad as those who hurt other people . I don ' t care whether they injure people while trying to pull a gold chain off their neck or by knocking them down while running_away from police or by domestic violence or by manslaughter , etc . If someone criminally injures another , that should be considered a felony subject_to a &quot; three strikes &quot; law . The point is that now that we finally have a strict and severe law , we need to do some serious fine-tuning to allow proper use of the law . After all most of us who clamored for it wanted some true justice , not petty revenge . BARBARA ASPENSON Los Angeles * Re &quot; Denny Case Defendant to Be Tried_on Gun Charge , &quot; Sept . 13 : I am somewhat confused by Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti and the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . First of all , Antoine Miller , after an argument goes_into his house and returns to a vehicle armed with a gun . He then proceeds to fire at the occupants and subsequently , at point blank range , tried to fire into the face of the driver . The gun jammed . The crimes that were committed here are assault with a deadly weapon and attempted murder . This would also be a &quot; strike &quot; under the new law , a second strike because Miller is already on felony probation . If we are to have citizens feel safe and to protect them at all , why is Miller only being charged with being a felon in possession of a gun ? It would be reassuring to hear from our D.A. ' s office the reasons why such lenient treatment has been afforded here . Are the victims afraid to testify ? Should citizens arm themselves for protection ? What ? JACK GOLD Sylmar * Re &quot; Striking Out , &quot; editorial , Sept . 23 : So the RAND Corp . has reported that the cost of reducing crime in California by one-third is estimated to be $ 300 per taxpayer per year . Sounds like a bargain to me ! Where do I send the check to pay my share ? JAMES FREDERICK ELWELL Palos Verdes Estates</TEXT>
