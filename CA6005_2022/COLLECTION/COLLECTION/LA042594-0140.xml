   <HEADLINE> TURKEY ' S AID TO IRAQI KURDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Your coverage of the helicopter tragedy in northern Iraq ( April 15 ) fails to show Turkey ' s essential role in_Operation Provide Comfort . Not only does Turkey permit Allied forces to use Turkish air_bases , but the Turkish military is actively taking_part in this humanitarian operation . Turkey ' s humanitarian help to the Kurdish population in northern Iraq is not limited to its part in this operation . Turkey is helping Iraqi Kurds by providing food aid and even electric_power . Turkey recently furnished $ 15 million to the Iraqi Kurds to manage their daily economic needs . The terrorist PKK organization recently sabotaged the power_lines in northern Iraq to prevent Iraqi Kurds from using the electricity provided by Turkey , showing once again that this terror organization ' s activities are not only a threat to the Turkish citizens living_in this border areas but to the well-being of Iraqi Kurds . The map attached to the story also is flawed in the sense that it designates some provinces of Turkey as &quot; areas of Kurdish majority , &quot; as if Kurdish citizens of Turkey do not belong_to the population as_a_whole . The April 17 Column Left makes a substantial blunder as well by comparing the situation of the Kurdish populations in Turkey and Iraq . Turkey is governed by a democratic parliamentary system , and Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin know they are unique and different from the Kurds living_in the neighboring countries , which are ruled by theocracies or one-party systems . All Turkish citizens , regardless of ethnic background , have the right to participate actively in Turkey ' s multi-party system . In the last local elections , Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin cast their votes among the 14 parties that participated in the election and ignored boycott calls from the PKK organization . The participation rate in the election was more_than 92 % . The Democratic Labor_Party , which stated open sympathy with the PKK in the past , opted to withdraw from the election , evidently to avoid a total electoral defeat . Your reporter fails to understand Turkey ' s problem is not with its ethnic Kurdish population , but with a terrorist organization , which is based and financed from abroad .
