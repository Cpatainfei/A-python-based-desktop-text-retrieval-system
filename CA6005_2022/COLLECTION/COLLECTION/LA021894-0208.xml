   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; MOE-HUM , ANOTHER U.S. MEDAL ; ALPINE : ALASKAN ADDS A SILVER IN SUPER-G TO HIS GOLD IN DOWNHILL , MAKING HIM FIRST AMERICAN MALE TO WIN TWO SKIING MEDALS AT ONE OLYMPICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American skiers aren ' t only gloating , they ' re yawning . This , as Swiss stars call it quits , Austrians duck for cover and the_French get fried . Four days after mining gold in the Olympic downhill , Tommy Moe struck silver in the men ' s super-giant slalom on Thursday , placing second behind Germany ' s Markus Wasmeier by eight one-hundredths of a second . Wasmeier ' s winning time was 1 minute 32.53 seconds . Moe ' s time ? Well , it has come . The crowd of 50 # 000 at the Kvitfjell Alpine Center to cheer the host-country favorite , Kjetil Andre Aamodt , had to settle for singing birthday wishes to an adopted son , Moe , who is of Norwegian descent . Aamodt finished third . With the silver , Moe , who celebrated his 24th birthday , dispelled notions that his downhill victory was a fluke . &quot; I didn ' t want to let this opportunity pass me by just because I won the downhill , &quot; he said . &quot; I knew I had just as good a chance as anybody. &quot; No telling what Tommy Moe might do at the Olympics if he could stay awake . Another big race ? In the starting_gate , Moe said , he yawned three or four times before blistering the course set by his coach , Bill Egan . It has been that kind of week for the United States in Alpine . The course setter is determined by random draw of coaches for the top 15 skiers . The chance of Egan ' s name being drawn , then , was one in 15 . Moe , who seems to be adjusting well to fame , learned he was_on the cusp of U.S. Alpine history while pouring milk on morning cereal . &quot; I was looking_at the past medal_winners when I was having breakfast , &quot; he said . Between bites , Moe noted that no U.S. male Alpine skier had ever won more_than one medal in the same Olympics . would n ' t it be cool to do that , he said . So Moe took_care of history in almost no time , 1:32.61 to be precise . He was not about to neglect his good_fortune . The key to Thursday ' s race was obtaining an early starting position so he could get_on the course before it became rutted by other skiers , leading to increasingly slower times . &quot; You can set your own tracks , &quot; he said . This Moe is no stooge . Turned_out the top four finishers were among the first nine racers . Moe drew start No . 8 in the downhill and wore bib No . 3 for the super-G . &quot; I don ' t like to sit around and see people ' s times , &quot; Moe said . &quot; I just want to go. &quot; Moe ' s hopes for double_gold were quickly dashed , though . His reign atop the leader board lasted the time it took Wasmeier , next down the_hill , to cross the finish_line . Moe ' s excitement was also tempered as he awaited the times of the two race favorites , Aamodt , the defending Olympic champion , and Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli . Aamodt , skiing seventh , made a run at the leaders but settled for third . Girardelli , skiing next , took fourth . The course got sloppy soon afterward , making_it difficult for skiers to hold their lines . After the top 10 had skied , no racer posed a serious threat to the leaders . Seeing as how no countryman has yet claimed Alpine gold , Norwegians have taken_to the American whose great-great grandfather hailed from Oslo . You might have expected fans to acknowledge the birthday of Norway ' s Atle Skaardal , who skied first and was treated in the finish corral with birthday song and cake . But how did they know about Moe ? When he crossed the finish , the crowd reprised &quot; Happy Birthday. &quot; When he realized the song was for him , Moe waved to the crowd and blew a kiss . &quot; It was kind of surprising , &quot; he said . &quot; It just makes_it really easy for the Americans to come_to Norway and enjoy the whole scene . The whole atmosphere is just wonderful. &quot; Strange how one ' s stature can change in four days . Moe ' s mother , Joann Persons , who could not afford to make the trip from Whitefish , Mont. , to Norway , was en route Thursday . After hearing that the mother of the Olympic downhill champion could not be with her son , citizens of Whitefish raised the money to pay her way . Medals talk . &quot; I can ' t believe I have two medals , &quot; Moe said . &quot; It just feels_out of this world . . . . A lot of people in the world would like to be in my boots right now . I kind of feel_like I ' m in a dream . It ' s hard to explain how overwhelmed I am right now. &quot; Meanwhile , the rest of the skiing world turns green with envy . With still a week of Alpine remaining , the United States already has more medals than ski powerhouses Austria and Switzerland combined . With two gold medals and a silver , the United States has a chance to eclipse its best Alpine performance , at Sarajevo in 1984 , when Americans won three gold and two silver medals . Don ' t expect the United States to send flowers . &quot; Teams like the Austrians and the_Swiss , they ' re expected to win , &quot; Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , said . &quot; They let that get_to them . It ' s their fault for letting it get_to them . We get beat year in and year out and nobody cries_for us . We ' re in Europe for three months , but nobody cries_for us. &quot; Even Aamodt , the finest all-around skier in the world , concedes that Americans are not afraid to go_for the jugular in big events . Aamodt said Norwegians , himself included , have always needed daily affirmation . Moe has helped Norway realize that it ' s OK to be good . &quot; Even if you do something special , you shouldn ' t think you ' re something special , &quot; Aamodt explained of old Norwegian thinking . &quot; You ( the United States ) like to be No . 1 . It ' s the American_Dream . I think the American_Dream is finally coming_to Norway for the Olympics. &quot; Moe , one of the dreamers , was disappointed that he had missed his second gold by . 08 . But if he could have chosen the man he might lose_it to , it might have been Wasmeier . The 30-year-old veteran from Schliersee , who restores antique paintings and plays Mozart on his violin in his spare_time , is the Diann Roffe-Steinrotter of the German team . Both were tremendous longshots to win . Both won their Olympic golds this week in super-G . Both rebounded from serious injury . Wasmeier , as had Roffe-Steinrotter , won the 1985 world championship -- in giant slalom . Neither had done much since . Roffe-Steinrotter has not won a World Cup race since 1985 . Wasmeier has won only one super-G since 1988 . This week , Roffe-Steinrotter mentioned to Wasmeier the similarities . &quot; She said : ' You could win the super-G too , ' &quot; Wasmeier said . &quot; It was a joke . I was very surprised I could win this race today. &quot; So far , the Olympics have been_full of Alpine surprises . Moe had never finished higher than third in a downhill and had never placed higher than third in a super-G . Moe , who has never won a downhill combined , will try to do so next Friday in the slalom after having placed third in the downhill segment earlier this week . Moe can ' t hold Alberto Tomba ' s boots in slalom , but who wants to bet against him ? &quot; If I ' m going_to beat Girardelli in slalom , I ' d better start training tomorrow , &quot; Moe said . Meanwhile , Austria picks_up the pieces after super-G finishes of ninth , 11th and 37th . La Belle France ? It had two finishers in the top 20 . Switzerland had to hang its ski_cap on Marc Hangl , who finished 10th . The Swiss team also announced the retirement of Franz Heinzer , the great downhiller , at 32 . Heinzer will be remembered this week for perhaps the shortest Olympic run in history when he popped_out of a ski just as he left the starting_gate . Isn ' t this what Americans used to do ?</TEXT>
