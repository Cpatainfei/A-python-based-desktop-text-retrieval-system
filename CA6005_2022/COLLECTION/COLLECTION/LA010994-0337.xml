   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS DON ' T EXPECT MUCH FROM CLINTON TRIP ; SUMMIT : PRESIDENT HAS LITTLE TO OFFER BESIDES MORAL SUPPORT . HIS PRIORITY WILL BE TRYING TO SHORE_UP ECONOMIC REFORMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After lashing back at Western-guided reformers in their parliamentary elections , Russians will take a skeptical first look_at President Clinton this week as he visits the former Communist empire that the West had pledged so grandly to remake . Hardened by two years of promise and frustration , Russians don ' t expect much . Nor does Clinton have much to offer beyond a new slogan of moral support during three days of talks with President Boris N . Yeltsin . Mindful of budget restraints at_home , growing resentment here of foreign advice and Moscow ' s delays in_using money already set_aside , the White_House has announced that there will be no new aid package this time . Planned as a celebration of the free-market reformers ' expected triumph in a democratic new Parliament , the summit has become a pause for sober reflection by both leaders over how to preserve Russia ' s still fragile transformation -- Clinton ' s top foreign_policy priority -- in the wake of stunning election gains last month by neo-fascists and Communists . &quot; This visit manifests a new period -- a partnership without illusions , &quot; said Vladimir P . Lukin , Russia ' s ambassador to the United States . &quot; We should stop behaving as a couple that vacillates between passionate kisses of love and equally passionate irritations over presumed betrayal. &quot; Lukin , who was elected to the Parliament as a moderate reformer and will soon leave his diplomatic post , said in an interview that the new period should be characterized by a search for Russia ' s &quot; own unique approach to economic reform &quot; and a greater independence from the West . It is a proud sentiment voiced these days by many Russians who accepted Western-prescribed market reforms launched in early 1992 . Billions of dollars in promised Western aid barely materialized , and they instead received the pain of high inflation , creeping unemployment and troubling rates of homelessness and crime . The souring of Moscow ' s expectations -- after thunderous applause for Yeltsin in the U.S. Congress in June , 1992 , and three upbeat summits with Presidents George_Bush and Clinton -- was dramatized on Dec . 12 when hard-line opposition parties that view the United States as an enemy won 45 % of the vote here . Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , the neo-fascist whose movement rode the backlash to a first-place finish , said Thursday that Clinton ought to stay home and &quot; play his saxophone. &quot; &quot; All of you in the West have become rotten and moldy , &quot; he said . &quot; You want us to be weak and to rot together with you . . . . Rot without us. &quot; On Saturday , however , Zhirinovsky took_on a conciliatory tone . In an interview with CNN , he insisted he seeks to cooperate with world leaders and even said he has a &quot; good opinion &quot; of Clinton . Russians interviewed at random in Moscow last week seemed to regard Clinton with the same skepticism they hold for their own politicians . While it is fine for him to come shake Yeltsin ' s hand and learn about their country , many of them said , it would not reverse the post-Communist decline in their living standards . &quot; Maybe in the future something will result from this visit , but as of now I see no reason why I should feel exultation , &quot; said Lidia A . Larina , 37 , a teacher who lost her job last year in a budget cutback . &quot; As for reforms , maybe Russia has gained from them , but I can ' t see what . &quot; Anyway , &quot; she added , &quot; the United States and its President cannot be blamed for the poverty in Russia . It is we who must solve our internal problems. &quot; Radical free-marketeers , who got 16 % of the Parliament vote , say the do-it-yourself mood is a healthy sign that Russians are learning to take personal responsibility after seven decades of communism and two years of excessive faith in Western aid . But the radicals ' immediate problem is how to save their policies and jobs . Since mid-1992 , they have been thwarted by a conservative faction of the government that opposes rigorous anti-inflation conditions set by the International Monetary Fund on the bulk of Western credits and that has repeatedly violated them . The radicals under Economics Minister Yegor T . Gaidar , who designed the reforms , say the biggest threat to Russia is inflation -- about 900 % last year . Inflation , they say , has been caused by the government exceeding IMF targets on state spending to bail_out money-losing industries . They say the sooner those industries are forced to close , the sooner the economy can be restructured and stop shrinking . Conservatives , led by Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , see a greater threat in mass unemployment . To avoid politically risky factory shutdowns , they argue that the West should aid a more gradual transition to the free market -- high inflation and all . Largely because the Cabinet is too divided to pursue a consistent strategy , promised aid has stalled . The IMF , for example , is holding_up a $ 1.5-billion credit agreed to last summer and a standby loan of several billion dollars because the government has failed to close a huge budget_deficit . And Russia has yet to use a $ 70-million loan approved last year by the World_Bank to set_up an unemployment benefits program -- the first_step of a planned Western-aided &quot; social safety net &quot; to ease the pain of reform . This is because the Russian Finance Ministry has clamped_down on borrowing that doesn ' t generate a cash flow . After voters rebelled last month , Yeltsin was urged to choose between the government ' s rival factions , but there is no sign he has done so . Both Gaidar and Chernomyrdin are expected to keep their jobs in a long-delayed Cabinet reshuffle -- an apparent recipe for more deadlock . Amid conflicting signals from his Administration , Clinton appeared to come_down on the side of the radical reformers Wednesday when he endorsed &quot; more attempts to build a safety net to deal with consequences of reform ( in Russia ) but not an attempt to slow_down the reform effort. &quot; But unless it is attached_to new funds for social spending , Russians may ignore such advice . Clinton himself characterized his &quot; more reform , more therapy &quot; prescription as a &quot; bumper sticker &quot; about the way his Administration feels about Russia . To hear Clinton repeat that slogan loud and clear in Russia is the best the radicals can hope for after an election that left them badly wounded . &quot; It ' s more important what he says than what he provides in actual money , &quot; said Anders Aslund , a Swedish economist on Gaidar ' s advisory team . But if Clinton listens to moderate reformers and centrists in the new Parliament -- as he must do to overcome criticism for supporting Yeltsin ' s violent closure of the old one -- he will hear a wide range of ideas on how to remake Russia , some of which have not been tested . Clinton is also likely to hear such assertiveness from Yeltsin himself , as the Russian leader stakes out an increasingly independent foreign_policy . Yeltsin is expected to argue against an eastward expansion of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . But Russians may_not be paying_attention . Former President Ronald Reagan ' s swashbuckling 1988 visit here during the heyday of perestroika and the big-money promises of former President George_Bush will be a hard act for Clinton to follow . &quot; The Russian people will soon start thinking_about these summits the way they think_about space flights , &quot; said Mikhail Berger , a columnist for the newspaper Izvestia . &quot; It is important , it is undoubtedly an achievement , but it is somewhere way up there , very remote . You can watch it on TV , but it has no consequence in real life. &quot;</TEXT>
