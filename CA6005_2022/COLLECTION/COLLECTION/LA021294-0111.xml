   <HEADLINE> LINCOLN CLUB WANTS EL TORO ISSUE ON BALLOT ; BASE REUSE : INFLUENTIAL O.C. GROUP SAYS DECISION IS TOO BIG TO BE LEFT TO POLITICIANS . SUPERVISORS HAVE RESISTED VOTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frustrated by the political indecision over the future use of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , an influential conservative political group is pushing for a countywide vote on the issue this November . The Lincoln Club , using the results of a recent poll showing Orange County residents divided over the future use of El Toro , plans to pressure the Board of Supervisors to place the issue on the November ballot , to let county voters decide . County supervisors have long opposed a ballot initiative on El Toro because of the belief that to do so would be to abdicate their responsibility to plan the county ' s future . But Lincoln Club President Doy Henley said Friday that his Republican group commissioned the &quot; unbiased , non-conflicting &quot; poll out of concern that county officials may decide on a redevelopment plan -- including whether or not to place a commercial airport at El Toro -- based on who makes the most noise . &quot; We thought ( the El Toro issue ) was too big to leave to the politicians to tap_dance around , &quot; Henley said . Emphasizing the role that the base is expected to play in reviving the county ' s anemic economy , Henley added : &quot; I think this is a 100-year -- a multi-generational -- issue for the county of Orange. &quot; While the supervisors are not expected to readily agree to put the future of El Toro on the ballot , the Lincoln Club ' s entry into the issue is not likely to be ignored since the group ' s membership roster includes major political contributors . The club ' s involvement also indirectly adds momentum to a petition drive for an El Toro ballot initiative being organized by a Newport Beach community-based group . Henley said the Lincoln Club would not be involved in the signature-gathering campaign -- many of the club ' s members are split on whether a commercial airport should be included in the base conversion plan -- but some of its members are expected to provide funding for the petition drive . For now , the Lincoln Club is preparing to present the poll results to the supervisors &quot; to persuade ( them ) that an issue like this ought to appear on the ballot in a constructive way , &quot; Henley said . &quot; I don ' t think they will &quot; agree . The El Toro issue has divided the county since July , when a federal base-closure commission voted to shut_down the base by 1999 . South County cities oppose a commercial airport at El Toro out of fear that it will disrupt their quality_of_life . After six months of political infighting , the planning for El Toro ' s conversion from military to civilian use was recently turned_over to a nine-member board that includes the county supervisors , three Irvine council_members and one Lake Forest council_member . The business_community , South County homeowner associations and council_members from all 31 Orange County cities will be invited to serve on an advisory panel that will pick the top three redevelopment plans for the 4 # 700-acre base . One of the leading proponents of developing a commercial airport at El Toro said the Lincoln Club ' s involvement shows the &quot; tremendous unrest &quot; over the Board of Supervisors ' handling of the El Toro planning . &quot; This is a conservative county , the Lincoln Club is a conservative organization , and they are at_odds with the Board of Supervisors . It ' s just that simple , &quot; said the airport proponent who agreed to talk on condition that he not be named . Supervisor William G . Steiner said he would &quot; welcome any material &quot; brought_to the board by the local business_community . &quot; But by the same token , I think the process we have in place has to be played_out . And the business_community is going_to play a big advisory role in that process , &quot; Steiner said . Before the creation of the county ' s El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , Steiner said he would have supported a public vote on the_matter &quot; only as a last resort. &quot; &quot; Now , we have a leadership structure in place , &quot; he said . &quot; Not everybody agrees that it is the best one . But on an important issue like this one , you are going_to find some disagreement . To take this to a vote of the people now would create the public perception that elected officials had abdicated their authority. &quot; Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley , who represents the district that includes the base , and Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , whose district is next to the base , have expressed similar viewpoints in the past . They could not be reached for comment Friday . Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder , who previously remained open_to the idea of a ballot measure , also could not be reached for comment . Supervisor Roger R . Stanton , who along with Steiner had earlier proposed a ballot measure as a last option , said that the &quot; idea ( of a ballot measure ) has some merit , but I certainly would not want to commit to it &quot; until he has reviewed the Lincoln Club ' s poll results . Stanton said a non-binding ballot measure to get the public ' s viewpoint on the issue could be included with other &quot; outside data &quot; that will be gathered before a final_decision is made on El Toro . &quot; I would not either accept or reject the ( ballot ) proposal out of hand , &quot; Stanton added . The Lincoln Club_members &quot; are serious about the well-being of the county. &quot; County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said he was &quot; surprised &quot; that such a survey was taken . &quot; I think the ( Board of Supervisors ) will want to see what comes_out of the existing process , &quot; he said . Irvine Mayor Michael Ward , who is a member of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , also said it would be premature to hold a public vote before the planning process is completed . &quot; If you don ' t like what we come_up with , then take that to the voters , &quot; Ward said . &quot; Give the ( planning ) process a chance . Ward reiterated that the screening of development options would be neutral . &quot; I could have told ( the Lincoln Club ) the county was split over the airport issue , &quot; he said . The Lincoln Club ' s poll , taken two weeks ago , asked 400 Orange County residents for their opinions on El Toro and the local economy . Several base-conversion options were part of the survey , including a regional airport , international airport or no airport , said Henley . Henley would not release the results , but sources familiar_with the poll said that opinions on both sides of the airport issue were so close that they fell within the margin of error of five points . &quot; We were trying to find_out . . . how people really feel , &quot; Henley said . The poll , he added , will be presented to the supervisors as a representation of &quot; all_the people of Orange County , and not just Lake Forest or Irvine or whatever. &quot; Shortly after the base was placed on the closure list last spring , a Times Orange County poll showed there was no consensus on how the base should be redeveloped . But 54 % disapproved when specifically asked whether the base should be converted into an international airport . Last September , a UC Irvine poll showed 48 % favoring a commercial airport for passenger and cargo flights , 42 % were opposed and 10 % were undecided . The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three points . Of the 4 # 700 acres at the base , an airport would take_up between 1 # 500 and 2 # 000 acres , officials have estimated . &quot; Either ( the Board of Supervisors ) put it on the ballot or they assume responsibility and do the job they were hired to do , &quot; Henley said . &quot; If the board is going_to run ( the El Toro project ) , they should run it. &quot; If the issue is not placed on the ballot , Henley added , &quot; then there will be the next stage , which would be going_through the political deal , getting the signatures , which I would hope we would be above that. &quot; The petition drive for a countywide initiative has not been formally announced , and is not expected to be unveiled until next week , at the earliest . Organizers must notify the county registrar of voters by March 11 of their intent to circulate petitions for a ballot initiative . To qualify for the Nov . 8 ballot , 66 # 703 signatures must be gathered and submitted to the county no later than June 1 . Several sources close to the campaign said the ballot petition would call_for an amendment to the county ' s General Plan and require that a commercial airport be included in the final base-conversion plan for El Toro . One of the planners for the countywide initiative said privately that business_community leaders , including some members of the Lincoln Club , have agreed to spend between $ 50 # 000 and $ 150 # 000 on the petition-gathering effort , depending_on the number of volunteers who are enlisted .</TEXT>
