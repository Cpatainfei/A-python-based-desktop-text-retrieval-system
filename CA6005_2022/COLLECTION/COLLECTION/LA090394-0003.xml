   <TEXT> Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year , comes early this year . Very early . Earlier than it has for 18 years . So early , in fact , that it catches congregants winding_up their summer vacations . And now the rush is_on . The rush to shop for a nice new outfit . The rush to lay_in a supply of gefilte_fish , turkey , brisket and honey_cake . The rush to get tickets for the synagogue services that always bring_in the biggest crowds of the year . &quot; Lots of people find themselves not having looked_at the calendar , and suddenly wake_up with shock , saying , ' Oh my God , do I have my tickets ? Do I have a place to go and where do I go if I don ' t ? ' &quot; said Rabbi Harvey J . Fields of Wilshire Boulevard Temple . His temple ' s office , like many others , will be staffed Sunday and Monday , despite the Labor_Day holiday , to help those who were not quite paying_attention and expected the High_Holy_Days to start sometime in mid-September or later . * The timing for Rosh Hashana is governed by the Jewish_calendar , which follows the sun as well as the moon and stays_on course with the injection of seven leap months over a 19-year cycle . Sometimes Rosh Hashanah comes as late as October . But this year , the solemn , reflective period known as the Days of Awe opens on the eve of the New Year on Monday night , as the last barbecue fumes of Labor_Day waft away with the evening breeze . &quot; There ' s getting kids ready for school , buying clothes and books , and to have the holidays at_the_same_time , it ' s a lot of pressure , &quot; said Shimon Kraft , who owns a book and Judaica shop in the Pico-Robertson district . &quot; And also it doesn ' t feel_like Rosh Hashanah when it ' s 95 degrees outside . . . . it feels strange. &quot; &quot; If it gets any earlier , I don ' t what I ' m going_to do , &quot; said Elizabeth Kraft , his wife . Not to worry . The holidays will not fall this early again until 2013 . But for now , the aisles of kosher emporiums such_as Elat Market on Pico Boulevard were as jammed with shoppers Thursday and Friday as the display_cases were piled high with carp , whitefish , chicken and beef cuts . Another mob scene was expected Sunday and Monday . &quot; It ' s always like this before the Sabbath but with Rosh Hashanah it ' s even worse , &quot; Ingrid Paredes , a store employee , said as she looked down on the bedlam from an upstairs office . &quot; We ourselves would rather not walk downstairs because we ' d get stuck , &quot; she said . A shopper , Rahamim Cohen , a retired oil_industry executive from Iran , explained that in addition to main_courses , tradition requires the blessing of 10 symbolic foods , especially honey and apples &quot; so all_the year should be sweet. &quot; &quot; It takes days to get ready , but it ' s fun , &quot; said Anna Geller , a homemaker from the former Soviet_Union . &quot; I came_to this country 20 years ago and I learned about the holidays and I love it. &quot; But with the early onset of the New Year , feelings are decidedly mixed in synagogue offices . &quot; It ' s every rabbi ' s and executive_director ' s nightmare , &quot; said Sonia Silverblatt , executive_director of Temple Beth Am near Beverly Hills . With 2 # 500 people already signed_up , she said , as_many as 100 more will come_out of the woodwork during the final days of the old year , which is said to be the 5 # 754th since Creation . * According to Jewish belief , Rosh Hashanah is the beginning of a 10-day period when the fate of every soul for the next year is decided . Repentance , prayer and charity are said to avert a harsh decree , so it should come as no surprise that the synagogues are_full . Latecomers for tickets include people who are only seen at services once a year , members behind on their dues , regular worshipers who decide it ' s time to join the congregation , and families with last-minute guests from out of town . Although High_Holy_Day tickets at Los Angeles synagogues can cost $ 100 to $ 200 , with full membership going_for up_to $ 1 # 000 , rabbis and administrators say that no one will be turned_away for lack of money . There is generally room for the latecomers because there are often members who do not get_around_to telling the office they would be out of town for the holidays . But with a_few exceptions , no one gets_in without a ticket . This might seem strange . After all , nobody would think_of charging for attendance at regular weekly services . Indeed , the Christian way of passing the collection_plate would be unthinkable on the Sabbath , when observant Jews will not even touch money . A few smaller congregations announce an open-door_policy , following up with fund-raising appeals once the holidays are over . But with no weekly collection , most synagogues have come_to depend_on the High_Holy_Days income as one of a number of fund-raising tools , along with dinner dances , benefit_concerts and hard-sell solicitation of wealthy members . They could not have picked a better time of the year to charge admission . &quot; These are very serious days , days when we ' re being judged , when our fate is being sealed , and there is a religious euphoria or stirring , &quot; said Rabbi Yisroel Kelemer of Congregation Mogen David near Cheviot Hills . &quot; Synagogues have used this opportunity as a form of sustenance , &quot; Kelemer said . &quot; Giving to the synagogue definitely is charity , and charity is one of the three elements that erases a stern decree from God. &quot; According to David Ellenson , a history professor at Hebrew Union College ' s Los Angeles campus , tickets are a 20th-Century American phenomenon . &quot; It ' s only in a country with a separation of church and state that this occurs , &quot; he said . In Eastern Europe , where the forebears of most American Jews came from , synagogues were supported by wealthy patrons or by the government , he noted , as is the case in Israel today . Then there ' s security . What with the recent attacks on Jewish and Israeli targets in England , Panama and Argentina , not to mention the low-level anxiety of everyday life in the big city , tickets help control who is walking through the door . Dues and ticket sales also help support synagogue schools , said Rabbi Morton A . Wallack of Adat Shalom Synagogue in Palms . &quot; The Jewish community has an obligation to maintain Jewish education . No Jewish child is turned_away from a Jewish education , &quot; he said . &quot; Well , somebody has to pay the bill. &quot; Then he told a joke . A man shows_up at the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah without a ticket . He tells the usher that he belongs_to the other congregation around the corner and he only wants to say hello to his grandfather . &quot; Well , OK , &quot; comes the response . &quot; But you better not let me catch you praying ! &quot;</TEXT>
