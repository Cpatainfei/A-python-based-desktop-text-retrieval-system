   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : THE WEST ; OFFBEAT OFF THE SLOPES ; OUT-OF-THE-ORDINARY WINTER SPORTS THAT OFFER THRILLS ALONG WITH THE CHILLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deciding on a ski destination once depended_on such quaint notions as vertical drop and size ofskiable terrain . Today , even the most die-hard skiers can experience the high point of their ski week -- figuratively and literally -- off the slopes . And the more off-the-wall , the better . Not to slight sleigh rides or run_down snowmobiles , but they just don ' t cut it when your cutting edge is as sharp as your skis ' . Even heli-skiing , if you can afford it , isn ' t exactly news . So this season , try something different . Pilot a luge . Attend ice driving school . Go_up in a glider plane , or snap on crampons for a tour of icefalls at the bottom of a frozen canyon . No experience necessary . If you can ' t pry yourself from your skis , check_out the country ' s only recreational ski-jump school . You can learn daffies and other aerial maneuvers , or simply make like Eddie the Eagle , the popular , semi-blind English ski_jumper who soared his way to fame in the Calgary 1988 Winter_Olympics . Moose and more in Jackson Hole : If you ' ve always assumed that winter is a lousy time to view wildlife -- with most species in hibernation or departed for warmer climes -- high-tail it to Jackson Hole , Wyo. , and book passage with the Great Plains Wildlife Institute . &quot; There ' s more viewing time per animal in winter , &quot; says staff naturalist Lorrie Lee . &quot; The animals are down in the valley , so you don ' t have to drive so_much , and because it ' s cold , they don ' t move a lot . Everything is still , quiet , defined. &quot; Even on four-hour sunrise expeditions ( which depart from Jackson at 8 a.m. ) , winter clients see at least 10 species -- from elk , moose , buffalo and bighorn_sheep to bald_eagles and trumpeter_swans . The full-day expedition , meanwhile , includes lunch , a snowshoe walk and hands-on research . This year ' s major project : tracking porcupines for a fire-ecology study . Now , that sounds like a sticky business . Half-day sunrise expeditions cost $ 65 , or $ 35 for children 3 to 12 . Full-day expeditions are $ 135 for both adults and children . Vehicles are equipped with roof hatches , spotting scopes and binoculars . The Great Plains Wildlife Institute will pick you up at any hotel in Jackson . Telephone ( 307 ) 733-2623 . Build an igloo in Canada : Why would anybody -- besides an Inuit , that is -- want to learn to build an igloo ? &quot; Because it ' s odd and unusual , of course , &quot; says Trent Schumann of Calgary , Alberta-based Mountain Quest Adventure Co . &quot; Most people come for the novelty . For back-country skiers interested in overnight touring , we offer a formalized course -- snow architecture. &quot; If you ' re staying in Calgary or at any Banff , Alberta-area resort ( such_as Lake Louise or Sunshine Village ) and want to learn to build an igloo -- or snow cave or trench shelter -- Schumann will pick you up for a one-day or overnight excursion into the Kananaskis backcountry , about a half-hour south of Banff and a 75-minute drive from Calgary and Lake Louise . &quot; We give them snowshoes , walk a_few miles into the woods , pull_out the snow shovels and snow saws and start building , &quot; Schumann explains . &quot; Igloos are nicer than tents . It normally doesn ' t get much lower than freezing inside , which is pretty amazing , considering it can get_down to 20 below zero outside . &quot; An igloo-building day trip is about $ 60 , including tools , snowshoes , lunch and transportation . For about $ 143 , an overnight trip adds supper , winter camping gear , breakfast and lunch . Tel . ( 800 ) ANY-TREK ( 269-8735 ) . Ups and downs of Squaw Valley : Forget 55-degree cliff runs -- you can get dead vertical and live to tell about it at Squaw Valley U.S.A. , on the north shore of Lake Tahoe . Bungee Squaw Valley is at the edge of a 500-foot precipice , adjacent to the High Camp Lodge at 8 # 200 feet . The platform is 75 feet up , and your fall is a maximum of 65 feet -- so there ' s at least 10 feet between you and the ground . The operation claims more_than 15 # 000 jumps , by jumpers 10 to 87 , with nary a nick . Ready to take the plunge ? Five , four , three , two . . . one jump is $ 40 , additional jumps $ 15 . Your leap on video is $ 20 , photos $ 13- $ 15 . Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tel . ( 916 ) 583-4000 . Soaring over Telluride : The Peaks at Telluride , a Colorado hotel-spa complex and the town ' s only high-rise , boasts a small climbing wall . But another Telluride enterprise allows visitors to climb thousands of feet higher . &quot; Glider Bob &quot; Saunders takes you soaring above the town and ski area in his sail plane . Don ' t confuse this activity with para-gliding , which involves a parachute , or hang-gliding , where you launch yourself off a cliff . &quot; Hang-gliding is notorious for injuries , &quot; Saunders says . &quot; Sail planes are safer than golf . The most dangerous part of an airplane is the motor , and we don ' t have one . There ' s nothing to go wrong. &quot; The sleek craft -- there ' s space only for the pilot and one passenger -- is towed in the winter to an altitude of 12 # 000 to 13 # 000 feet and released . The high altitude might draw thrill-seekers , but Saunders says the quiet and scenery are the real attraction . Rides cost $ 75 for a half hour and $ 120 for an hour ( times are approximate. ) Telluride Soaring is located at the Telluride Regional Airport . Tel . ( 303 ) 728-5424 . Park City jumps and daffies : With a bit of instruction , even &quot; very timid , very nervous people &quot; can handle ski_jumps , says coach Larry Stone of the National Sports Foundation at Utah Winter Sports Park , site of the only recreational ski-jumping program in the United States . &quot; Of course , &quot; he adds , &quot; Forget it if you ' ve got a fear of heights -- better go cross-country skiing. &quot; Lessons begin on itty-bitty snow bumps . First-timers can come_away with an 18-meter jump ( about 40 feet ) , but that ' s length ; they only get two or three feet off the ground . There ' s also a 38-meter jump , but the 65- and 90-meter competition jumps are reserved for the kind of daredevils made famous in the opening shots of ABC ' s &quot; Wide World of Sports. &quot; Stone says that in the park ' s freestyle-aerial program , skiers with &quot; basic skills &quot; can tackle such aerial moves as helicopters ( a 360-degree spin ) , daffies ( a walking motion ) and splits . The statistics would seem to bear him out : Since the park opened in 1992 , officials have logged only a handful of injuries , none serious , in thousands of jumps . Lessons in distance jumping ( Fridays to Sundays ) and freestyle ( Saturdays beginning Dec . 31 ) are $ 20 for adults , $ 12 for ages 13 through 17 , $ 8 for 12 and under . National Sports Foundation clinics take_place from 1 to 3 p.m. , with sign-ups at noon . Tel . ( 801 ) 645-7660 or ( 801 ) 649-5447 . Whooshing in Calgary : You don ' t need to go faster than a speeding bullet to feel_like one at Canada Olympic Park in Calgary , built for the 1988 Winter Games . When you ' re blasting down the track only a_few inches above the ice , 30 miles an hour will do just fine . To ride the luge , a one-person open sled , you put_on a helmet and elbow_pads , lie on your back and guide the sled feet-first for a 35-second ride down the bottom third of the Olympic track -- 500 yards with five curves . Or you can join three other people on a new self-steering , self-braking sled called the Bob Bullet , which rockets down the entire Olympic one-mile run at speeds of up_to 60 miles per hour . Bullet riders are enclosed up_to neck level in the padded sled and wear seat_belts and helmets during the 1 1 / 2-minute ride . A ride_on the luge ( minimum age is 12 ) costs about $ 9 for the first run , $ 6 for subsequent runs . Minimum age for the Bob Bullet is 16 ; cost is $ 29 per person , per run ; subsequent runs are $ 26 . The luge operates Monday night s only , from 6-7 p.m. Bullet rides are offered Saturday and Sunday late afternoons , and Mondays at 7 p.m. through Feb . 26 . Tel . ( 403 ) 247-5490 . Reservations recommended . Ice walking in Jasper : During the summer months , a prime attraction of Jasper National_Park in Alberta , Canada , is a drive along the spectacular &quot; Icefields Parkway , &quot; a 142-mile-long highway that passes dozens of glaciers . But for an up-close-and-personal glimpse of ice and snow when you ' re ready for a break from the slopes at nearby Marmot Basin Ski Area , it ' s tough to beat the park ' s Maligne Canyon Icewalk . Three magnificent frozen waterfalls -- the highest of which is 120 feet -- are the highlights of the three-hour walking tour , which is 1 1 / 2 miles each way and takes you past limestone formations and snow and into huge caverns along a frozen river at the bottom of a 150-foot-deep canyon . &quot; Some years we can walk behind the falls , and it ' s as if you ' re in an ice cave , with an eerie bluish light , &quot; says park interpreter Murray Morgan . The canyon is a half-hour drive from Marmot Basin , about four hours from either Calgary or Edmonton . Jasper Adventure Center ice-walk tours begin at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Cost is about $ 16 , $ 8 for children 6 to 12 and includes boot s , crampons to help prevent slipping , and local transportation . Tel . ( 403 ) 852-5595 . Slick driving in Steamboat : Get_in a car and slide , skid and spin your way through a class on ice driving . And while you learn how not to lose_control on the highway , you can enjoy the thrill of doing just that -- in a safe environment . &quot; You don ' t need to go fast to get your adrenaline up , &quot; says Mark Cox , manager of the Bridgestone Winter Driving_School at Steamboat Springs , Colo . &quot; Especially when you ' re going sideways. &quot; Snow-banked guard rails &quot; pardon &quot; driver error on a mile-long road course with eight turns . Indoor classes explore concepts of car control in low-traction situations , such_as on rain-soaked pavement . &quot; An L.A. off-ramp the first day it rained was one of the slipperiest situations I ' ve ever encountered , &quot; Cox says . The half-day , level-one session , at $ 90 , includes about an hour of theory and two hours on the track . The one-day level-two course , $ 190 , adds videotape analysis and more hands-on practice . Level three , a day-and-a-half-long course , is $ 340 and focuses_on performance-oriented techniques . Phone ( 303 ) 879-6104 or ( 800 ) WHY-SKID ( 949-7543 ) .</TEXT>
