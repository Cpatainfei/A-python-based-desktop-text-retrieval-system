   <HEADLINE> GENETIC DISCOVERY MAY AID EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF DYSLEXIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a finding that could soon have a major impact on the diagnosis and treatment of dyslexia , scientists have identified genetic markers that should allow early identification of the reading disorder in high-risk children or even in fetuses , experts said Thursday . San Diego and Colorado researchers report today in the journal Science that they have linked the reading disorder , which arises in people with an otherwise normal intelligence , to a small region of chromosome 6 , one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that compose the human genetic blueprint . While they are racing to identify the gene in this region that causes dyslexia , they are also developing a genetic test that could identify the disorder long before a child attempts to begin reading . Using recently developed interventions and new techniques for diagnosing dyslexia at ages 5 to 6 , clinicians now can make significant improvements in the reading ability of perhaps half the children treated . But the diagnostic techniques are not widely available yet , and dyslexia , which affects 5 % to 10 % of the population , is not normally diagnosed until around age 8 . By that age , even the best interventions can help no more_than 25 % of dyslexics . Most researchers believe that the interventions would be even more effective if they could be applied at an earlier age , but there has previously been no way to determine the presence of dyslexia in younger children . With dyslexia , a person ' s ability to perceive and process words , numbers and other symbols is impaired . Often , letters or numbers may appear reversed , for example , making_it unusually difficult for a person to absorb the information on a page . A new genetic test for the disorder based on today ' s findings would be invaluable , said neuropsychologist Reid Lyon of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development . &quot; There is no doubt that we can make much greater improvements if it ( dyslexia ) is discovered earlier , &quot; he said . &quot; If one could identify these children well before they start school , for example , they could begin intensive training in time to avoid the potential for psychological trauma that reading deficits can cause in the classroom , &quot; said geneticist John DeFries of the University of Colorado , one of the study ' s co-authors . The finding could be &quot; extremely significant , &quot; said Will Baker , executive_director of the National Dyslexia Research Foundation . &quot; The issue we always deal with is the low self-esteem that the kids develop from failures in the classroom when their dyslexia isn ' t recognized . This discovery could change that. &quot; Researchers have previously localized the cause of dyslexia to changes in &quot; the back_end of the left side of the brain , ( in ) the temporal_lobe area , &quot; Lyon said . In August , furthermore , a New Jersey team reported that this region of the brain in dyslexics contains a deficiency in cells that specialize in comprehending rapid sounds . This lack of comprehension , suggested Paula Tallal of Rutgers University , may be a major factor_in the later difficulty in learning to read . Speculation about the source of these differences between dyslexic and normal brains has included exposure to viruses , chemicals or hormones during pregnancy and trauma in the womb . While those factors may play a role , DeFries and his colleagues have shown by twin studies that genetics is very important . In the new study , DeFries and his colleagues at the University of Colorado , Sequana Therapeutics in San Diego and Boys Town National Hospital in Omaha studied two different groups of dyslexics . One group comprised 50 sets of fraternal twins in which at least one twin was dyslexic . The second group consisted_of 358 individuals from 19 extended families with a history of dyslexia . By using recently developed genetic_engineering techniques to identify genetic markers in DNA from the blood of the subjects , the researchers were able to show that the suspected gene was in a region of chromosome 6 that could contain a_few genes or as_many as 200 . They are now trying to identify the specific gene involved . Although it could take several years to identify the gene , the new study promises to have an impact much sooner . &quot; We could , in principle at least , make informed guesses right now as_to whether particular children are at risk or not , &quot; University of Colorado geneticist Dale Fulker said . But practically speaking , he added , it will take Sequana Therapeutics six to 18 months to develop a genetic test that could make such determinations widely available . * Neuroscientist Gordon Sherman of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston cautioned , however , that the new study still must be replicated , noting that an earlier study linking dyslexia to chromosome 15 could not be replicated . Today ' s study , however , &quot; appears to be much more robust , &quot; he said . The new results , he said , brought him &quot; great excitement . . . . If you can diagnose this early and start to treat it , you can bypass some of the emotional problems that come_with being in school and failing and not knowing why -- and being treated in a very poor way. &quot;</TEXT>
