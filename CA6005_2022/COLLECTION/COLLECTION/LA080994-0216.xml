   <HEADLINE> PLACING_BETS ON A SINGLE EUROPE CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year after it was pronounced all but dead , the European Monetary System has defied projections and embarked_on a tentative but definite revival . The revival has rekindled hope among advocates of closer European integration that a single currency could become a reality throughout the European Union -- if not by the end of the century , then in the early 2000s . The prospect was set_out in the 1991 Maastricht Treaty , and its importance is rarely disputed . It is widely believed that the proposed European Monetary Union would not just simplify trade and other business_activities but would quickly drive EU member countries into a true political union . &quot; If the political will is there to push_forward with EMU , then you don ' t have to worry about anything else -- because EMU is the fastest way to derive political union , &quot; declared Stanley Crossick , chairman of the Belmont European Policy Center in Brussels . &quot; Conversely , if EMU looks_like ( it ' s ) falling_apart , there will be serious political consequences. &quot; It was in September , only a month after the EMS had escaped its deepest crisis , alive but seriously weakened , that British Prime_Minister John Major said publicly what many others believed but dared not speak . &quot; I hope my fellow heads of government will resist the temptation to recite the mantra of full economic and political union as if nothing had changed , &quot; Major warned . &quot; If they do recite it , it will have all_the quaintness of a rain_dance and about the same potency. &quot; It was difficult to dispute Major ' s flip analysis of the prospects of the EMS . Over a_few midsummer_days , currency dealers had basically blown apart the system that lies at the heart of Europe ' s efforts to achieve greater unity . Put simply , the dealers had bet billions -- and won -- on their conviction that the nine national currencies involved in the system ' s exchange_rate mechanism could not stay within the narrow bands of fluctuation that tied them together . To save the system itself , exhausted and defeated European Union finance_ministers met in Brussels and surrendered to the markets , loosening the narrow bands from 2.25 % ( 6 % for Spain and Portugal ) to a startling 15 % . The move eased speculative pressure , but it seemed to be the death_knell for eventual monetary union . The architects of a single European currency had always envisioned that their goal would be reached by a gradual narrowing of fluctuations , then a freeze and the eventual imposition of a single currency . This defeat -- followed by the 1992 departure of the Italian_lira and the_British pound from the exchange_rate mechanism and the distinct cooling of Germany , the EU ' s biggest country , toward the idea -- seemed to spell the end of the single currency dream . Today , the lira and the pound ( and the Greek drachma ) remain outside the exchange_rate mechanism , and German doubts on EMU persist , but an unexpected stability of the new , looser exchange_rate mechanism has brightened prospects . Instead of trying to push for competitive advantage through fluctuations of near 15 % , most central_banks have kept the value of currencies in close contact with each other . But the real test is whether this commitment is strong enough to meet the tough fiscal criteria necessary to begin the final stage of a monetary union . As detailed in the Maastricht Treaty , these would require countries to cut budget_deficits and reduce total debt . At present only Luxembourg would qualify as prepared_for the final step . However , advocates of European integration insist the necessary political will is there . Brussels Bureau researcher Isabelle Maelcamp contributed to this article .
