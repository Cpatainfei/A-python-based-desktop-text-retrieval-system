   <HEADLINE> CONCUSSIONS DRAWING MORE CONCERN ; PRO FOOTBALL : DOCTORS ARE MORE CAREFUL NOW ABOUT ALLOWING PLAYERS RETURN TO THE LINEUP AFTER THESE HEAD INJURIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Post-concussion syndrome , the new buzz words around the NFL this season , have come_down hard on quarterbacks Chris Miller of the Rams , Vinny Testaverde of Cleveland and Dallas ' Troy Aikman . Twelve days after suffering a concussion , Miller still complains of headaches , blurred vision and memory_loss . Testaverde is still groggy , and Aikman , floored one week by Arizona ' s Wilber Marshall , was in uniform the next week . The syndrome forced Chicago running back Merril Hoge and New York Jet wide receiver Al Toon to retire recently . Doctors once dismissed the syndrome as paranoia , but recent studies have proved otherwise . &quot; You used to send people home after a trivial car wreck , and they looked fine , &quot; said Dr. Alex Valadka , assistant_professor of neurosurgery at Baylor College of Medicine . &quot; Then they kept coming_back , complaining of headaches . In the past , you sent them home again , thinking they were crazy . But not anymore. &quot; NFL players need only a matter of weeks for broken bones or muscle tears to heal , but it can take several months for effects of a concussion to subside , doctors said . &quot; The Rams have to ask themselves what they want to do with Miller right now , &quot; Valadka said . &quot; I ' ve treated some high_school kids after they get their bell rung on Friday nights , and it ' s a tough question to face . &quot; Usually , it ' s the best player on the team and he ' s trying to get a college scholarship . So do you send him back and let him risk ending his career altogether , or keep him out ? &quot; A sports injury handbook published by Barrons instructs football_players who suffered concussions to &quot; lay off 28 days and seek medical advice before returning to the game. &quot; Aikman played in the Super Bowl last January after a serious concussion hospitalized him after the NFC Championship Game against San Francisco . Although Aikman played , that doesn ' t necessarily mean Miller should , Valadka said . &quot; There ' s not much that can be done at this time for him , &quot; he said . &quot; You can try some kinds of cognitive rehabilitation , but that takes time . The bad news is that this takes a long_time , but the good news is that everyone comes around. &quot; Dr. Sean Grady , an associate_professor of neurological surgery at the University of Washington , said the recovery time depends_on the person and the degree of the injury . &quot; Some people with his problem take_up to three months to fully recover , &quot; he said , &quot; where others are fine within a couple days. &quot; Grady compared the brain ' s role in a concussion to that of a bowl of Jell-O being shoved into a wall . &quot; The brain has the consistency of Jell-O and floats in water , &quot; he said . &quot; It shifts and moves with injuries . When the bowl stops ( hitting the wall ) , the Jell-O continues , then goes backward , vibrating back and forth. &quot; The concussion jars the brain , stalling the electrical signals from moving through the nervous_system , he said . Miller suffered his concussion when he was hit by New Orleans ' Ernest Dixon in the first_quarter of the Rams ' 37-34 loss to the Saints on Oct . 23 . He hit the back of his helmet on the Astroturf but remained conscious . He stayed in the game for the rest of the first_half and threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce . But Miller began feeling dizzy at halftime , and the Rams pulled him out for the second_half . An MRI test and CAT scan showed no brain damage , but Miller complained of pressure in his temples as if he had a bad head_cold . He still has trouble formulating plays and &quot; pre-snap stuff , &quot; and struggles to focus during game-plan meetings . His blurry vision prevents him from reading a newspaper and seeing playing cards during locker_room games with his teammates . &quot; Those are very typical effects from a concussion , &quot; Grady said . &quot; About 30 to 35 % of all people have those effects , and their MRI and CAT scans are completely normal. &quot;</TEXT>
