   <HEADLINE> THE LAST GASP OF A MORIBUND SYSTEM ; MEXICO : THE RULING PARTY GOES THROUGH THE MOTIONS FOR A CANDIDATE WHO ' S BANKING ALL ON A GHOST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time -- and almost certainly for the last -- Mexico ' s quasi-magical succession mechanism has been called into use twice to replace one leader : last November , when Luis Donaldo Colosio was appointed Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s successor , and now this past week as Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon was chosen to succeed the assassinated Colosio . The mechanism had never been strained as much , and in this , its last hurrah , while it has performed admirably , it is clearly showing the signs of its old_age . The presidential prerogative of personally selecting a successor worked again : Zedillo was Salinas ' choice , and his alone . As always , there was no pretense of a democratic process , no alternative candidacies , no debate , no primaries , no vote . As on some_other occasions , there were resistances , disgruntled though silent losers and , exceptionally , a lackluster cargada , the ceremony whereby thousands of pristas of all stripes and colors troop down to party headquarters or to the lucky candidate ' s home to express their support and , hopefully , begin lining_up for jobs in the next administration . The tragic circumstances in which the unveiling took_place , and the resigned reluctance with which Zedillo was accepted , did not allow_for much enthusiasm in the traditional buffalo charge that is such a distinctive_feature of Mexican politics . Still , one cannot but marvel at the way in which the entire political elite of a nation of 90 million inhabitants can rally to the cause of a second-best candidate without one single public dissenting voice , simply because a sitting president , presiding over a failed presidency , asked them to . But along with this impressive show of control , Salinas ' handling of the worst political crisis in the country ' s contemporary history also revealed the intrinsic and fatal weaknesses of the system . There has been no successful presidency in Mexico since Adolfo Lopez Mateos left_office in 1964 ; every_other administration has ended in discredit , disgrace and disarray . Thus the succession mechanism inevitably implies a drastic break between the outgoing leader and the incoming one ; it ' s the only way the new leader can overcome the opprobrium heaped upon his predecessor . The failed president takes the heat and the blame for everything ; the new one , whatever his responsibilities in the previous administration , acts_as if he played no role in the fiasco . Herein lies the reason so many Mexicans of all persuasions , including a surprising number of party and government officials , believe that the government of Carlos Salinas had something to do with the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio . They are wrong : For Salinas , the political consequences and emotional impact of the assassination are such_that it is inconceivable that Colosio ' s elimination could have been a desired and deliberate solution to any imaginable problem . But the tensions between Colosio and Salinas were so apparent , were growing so rapidly and extending_to so many spheres , that in an uninformed and eternally distrustful nation , the suspicions of misdeeds are unavoidable . Colosio had to break_with Salinas , even had he faced no rivals in his quest_for the presidency . Facing a strong contender like Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , and having to address the incessant unraveling of Salinas ' achievements , he had no choice . Zedillo would have no choice either , all other things being equal -- which they are not . He does not have the time , experience or political strength to consummate such a tricky maneuver even under ideal circumstances . So , if Zedillo cannot break_with Salinas , he will try a different tack : Run_on Colosio ' s martyred coattails , powered by the &quot; Pedro Infante effect. &quot; Infante was Mexico ' s star of stars in the 1940s and ' 50s , the golden years of the Mexican movie_industry . When he died in an airplane crash in 1956 , the outpouring of popular sentiment was extraordinary . Attending his funeral or following it on the radio remains a memorable moment in the lives of millions of Mexicans . Salinas and the PRI -- the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- are seeking to generate a similar groundswell in_relation_to Colosio , hoping they can thus propel Zedillo to victory . It was no accident that Zedillo mentioned Colosio 39 times in his 20-minute acceptance speech Tuesday . It may work , but the course is a risky one . If the Pedro Infante effect does not deliver the votes , the only other option is ominous . It entails playing to the Mexican people ' s fears of instability and violence , and promising order , a strong hand and a hard line -- a temptation that every Mexican president has encountered but that only Gustavo Diaz Ordaz in 1968 succumbed to . Mexico is a country where knowing what the people think or feel is no simple task . The sorrow , shock , despair or fear that are supposedly sweeping the nation ' s psyche today are easier to detect in politicians ' speeches and journalists ' cliches than in any palpable signs of popular sentiment . No one can tell if the current sympathy for Colosio will last , or whether it is transferable to another candidate just because he invokes the martyr ' s name . And there is no certainty that the clamor for law and order is greater than that for democracy . Going the low road and seeking to shut_down the already narrow confines of Mexican democracy means reversing the attempts at true electoral reform that the Chiapas uprising has generated . It means risking further unrest in the south , as well as post-electoral strife come August . It is indeed a non-starter . The country is in_trouble . The unanimity of the political elite on which its authoritarian system has rested for decades has resulted in the absurd situation whereby , as Carlos Fuentes has said , there seem to be only two men ( Salinas and Zedillo ) and a ghost ( Colosio ) who can rule Mexico . A clean election and a substantive campaign will not solve all_of the country ' s problems ; years of negligence and corruption require a lengthy cleanup . But they can help , and without them , few things seem possible . Mexico has for years been a nation where only outcomes count . The time has come_to begin building a process that makes outcomes largely irrelevant . The old process almost certainly is beyond repair .</TEXT>
