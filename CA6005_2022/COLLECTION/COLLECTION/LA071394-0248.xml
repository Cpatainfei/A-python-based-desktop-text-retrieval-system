   <HEADLINE> GOP SENT CONDOLENCES TO COMMUNISTS ; DIPLOMACY : CLINTON ' S MESSAGE TO NORTH_KOREA ECHOES NOTES ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS UPON DEATHS OF MAO TSE-TUNG AND STALIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When President Clinton expressed condolences to the North_Korean people for the death Friday of their president , Kim Il Sung , Republicans lambasted him for insensitivity to the families of the 54 # 000 Americans killed in the Korean_War . &quot; I don ' t think we sent any condolences when Mao Tse-tung died , &quot; sniffed Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) this week . But the record shows that is not true . In fact , Gingrich and some_other Republicans such_as Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) are attacking the Democratic President for an action quite similar to what their own party did when it occupied the White_House at the time of Mao Tse-tung ' s death . Files obtained by The Times from the Gerald R . Ford Presidential Library indicate that on Sept . 9 , 1976 , the day Mao died , the Republican President sent his condolences for the death of the Chinese leader -- whose troops fought side_by_side with Kim Il Sung ' s army against American forces in the 1950-53 Korean_War . &quot; Mrs . Ford joins me in extending_to you our deepest sympathy on the death of Chairman Mao Tsetung , &quot; wrote the Republican President in a signed note on White_House stationery . &quot; Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era . . . . Please accept my personal condolences. &quot; In a sense , Ford ' s condolences concerning Mao went one step further than Clinton ' s . They were addressed directly to &quot; Madame Mao &quot; -- that is , Jiang Qing , then a political_leader of the ultra-leftist , anti-American forces in Beijing . Thus , they gave a dollop of White_House recognition to Mao ' s wife , at a time when she and her allies , known as the &quot; Gang of Four , &quot; were striving to consolidate control of the Chinese leadership . ( They failed , and a month after Mao ' s death , she was imprisoned. ) If Clinton had followed Ford ' s example , he might have addressed his condolences to Kim Jong Il , who is Kim Il Sung ' s son . But he addressed his message to &quot; the people of North Korea. &quot; Clinton ' s condolence statement , issued Saturday , said in its entirety : &quot; On behalf of the people of the United States , I extend sincere condolences to the people of North_Korea on the death of President Kim Il Sung . We appreciate his leadership in resuming the talks between our governments . We hope they will continue as appropriate. &quot; * Dole , who is now preparing a possible run_for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination , has been the most determined and vehement critic of Clinton ' s condolence message on Kim Il Sung ' s death . But in 1976 , at the time of Ford ' s Mao Tse-tung condolence message , Dole was Ford ' s vice presidential running_mate . Dole ' s criticisms of Clinton have been picked_up and rebroadcast by conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh . &quot; Perhaps President Clinton has forgotten that Kim Il Sung was responsible_for the war that caused the loss of more_than 54 # 000 American lives and 100 # 000 Americans wounded , &quot; Dole declared last weekend . In fact , Mao was at least arguably responsible_for far more American deaths than his Korean counterpart . China intervened in the Korean_War in October , 1950 , at a time when Gen . Douglas MacArthur was driving North_Korean forces toward the Yalu_River border with China and American forces were widely thought to be within a_few weeks of victory . Well_over half of America ' s casualties in the Korean_War took_place after Mao ' s forces entered the conflict . * On Tuesday , Clarkson Hine , Dole ' s press secretary , insisted that there were &quot; significant differences &quot; between Ford ' s condolences and Clinton ' s . &quot; First , unlike President Ford , President Clinton took the liberty of extending his condolences ' on behalf of the American people , ' &quot; Hine said . &quot; If President Clinton wants to extend his personal condolences , Sen . Dole has no quarrel with that . The problem is that President Clinton signed the name of every American to the Kim Il Sung sympathy_card . Second , China had already taken positive , concrete steps to improve relations. &quot; Following Dole ' s criticisms , Clinton defended his message , saying that his condolence note concerning Kim Il Sung was &quot; to_the_point and appropriate and very much in the interest of the United States. &quot; Democratic Sen . Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) pointed_out Tuesday that the Eisenhower Administration sent its own condolences after the death of another brutal leader -- Josef Stalin , who died in 1953 .</TEXT>
