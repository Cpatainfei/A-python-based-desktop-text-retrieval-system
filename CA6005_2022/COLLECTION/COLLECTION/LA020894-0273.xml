   <HEADLINE> ANIMATION COMPANY NO LONGER IN ' TOONS ; TELEVISION : DESPITE SOME SUCCESSFUL SHOWS , ZODIAC ENTERTAINMENT FINDS IT IS TOO SMALL TO COMPETE IN THE CARTOON PRODUCTION BUSINESS . IT WILL CONTINUE AS A DISTRIBUTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Its British parent company pumped $ 35 million into the business over four years , and three of its cartoon shows made_it ont U.S. television . &quot; Widget , &quot; its cartoon about an environmentally conscious alien , was recommended for viewing by the National Education Assn . and was sold to 100 countries . But that was not enough to keep Zodiac Entertainment in the cartoon production business . The Studio City-based company announced late in December that its effort to find a niche as an independent producer in the fiercely competitive animation world was over . From now on , Zodiac will only be a distributor -- of its existing cartoon programs , and whatever distribution rights it picks_up from other animation firms . Meanwhile , Zodiac ' s once enthusiastic co-founders , Peter Keefe and Brian Lacey , have left the company to start a new animation venture . For children , the demise of Zodiac means no more new episodes of &quot; Widget , &quot; &quot; Mr. Bogus &quot; and &quot; Twinkle the Dream Being. &quot; For Zodiac , it is a stark illustration of the perils of battling the big animation studios . &quot; The business is nowadays very competitive . . . and it ' s not a business Zodiac can play in , &quot; said Kevin Morrison , Zodiac ' s president , who remains with the company . &quot; It ' s simply not a big enough player. &quot; Even in its heyday , Zodiac was a small operation ; in 1992 its revenue was only about $ 10 million . Zodiac withdrew from production only a month after its parent firm -- Britain ' s Central Independent Television -- agreed to merge with Carlton Communications , another U . K . entertainment concern . But Morrison denied that had anything to do with Zodiac ' s change_of_course . &quot; This was a business decision , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s been building over a number of years. &quot; According to Morrison , the business looked quite different when Zodiac was founded in 1989 by Central along with Keefe and Lacey , both animation veterans . The late- ' 80s independent American TV_stations had created great demand for syndicated programming . With such big producers as Walt Disney Co . and Warner Bros . still preoccupied with network TV , there seemed to be a niche for &quot; boutiques &quot; like Zodiac that could make cartoons for syndication . The trouble was that the majors soon recognized the same opportunity . Once they had organized themselves to exploit it , they shoved aside the small producers in the quest_for syndication dollars . &quot; Disney merely had to announce they were going_into that business and stations signed_up , &quot; Morrison recalled . &quot; Whereas Zodiac , which is a new and struggling company , said , ' We ' re going to do &quot; Widget , &quot; ' and people said , ' Who are you ? ' &quot; Morrison said Zodiac succeeded in overcoming this credibility problem . &quot; Widget &quot; is about a purple alien who goes_around transforming himself into various characters helping to solve environmental problems . In 1990 , Morrison noted , &quot; Widget &quot; played_on 80 % of independent U . S . stations and , the following year , it went_to five shows a week . And he said during the May &quot; sweeps &quot; week of 1992 , &quot; Mr. Bogus , &quot; a cat-and-mouse type cartoon , was the highest-rated weekly syndicated children ' s show . But Zodiac was having trouble getting what Keefe calls &quot; on-Broadway &quot; time_slots -- between 7 and 8 in the morning , and between 3:30 and 5:30 in the afternoon . &quot; The reality is you have to have ' on-Broadway ' time_periods , &quot; said Keefe , who was Zodiac ' s director of production and strategic planning . &quot; The number of children watching in those periods is quadruple that in other periods. &quot; One problem for Zodiac was its lack of advertising clout , Morrison said . For those prime slots , he explained , stations favor cartoon shows whose characters are also popular toys , or which are produced by big studios . It ' s a lucrative payoff for the TV_stations , because often the toy company guarantees to buy large blocks of their advertising time . In true Hollywood tradition , it is often the deal that counts in animation , not the show . Zodiac ' s shows &quot; were perceived by broadcasters as nines or 10s as programs , but as business_deals , they were fours , &quot; Keefe said . Other industry players said Zodiac could have found a way around such problems . Jeff Segal , president of MCA ' s Universal Cartoon Studios , suggested that the company could have worked like a subcontractor . If a studio wished to make a cartoon based on a toy or a comic_strip , they could turn_to Zodiac rather than going in-house . &quot; If the fifth network goes_ahead , and assuming CBS and Fox and the others stay in the animation business , there ' s always going_to be room for small boutiques that take_in a project they may_not have originated , &quot; Segal said . Ken Spears , vice_president of Ruby-Spears Productions , another animation independent , pointed to the example of Film Roman . The North Hollywood studio helped get the idea to take the popular comic_strip &quot; Garfield &quot; and turn the mischievous feline into a hit TV cartoon , with toy company advertising galore . &quot; They got_hold_of a popular character , &quot; Spears said . &quot; They ' ve been very successful and been able to continue based on a not very large volume of work. &quot; According to Morrison , adopting such strategies would mean betraying Zodiac ' s philosophy of putting programming first . Going &quot; cap in_hand &quot; to the big toy companies , he said , &quot; we regarded that as a prostitution of program-making. &quot; He added : &quot; Temperamentally , as a broadcaster , ( Central ) wants to make programming for programming ' s sake rather than because of the advertising tie-ins . They simply decided it wasn ' t the sort of game they wanted to be in and they would retire. &quot; Despite that retirement , Zodiac intends to remain an active player by distributing its existing cartoons and shows it will acquire from others . Morrison said Central ' s merger with Carlton -- whose Hollywood interests also include Technicolor Inc. , a film processing company , and Complete Post , a large post-production facility in Los Angeles -- will help Zodiac expand its distribution business . &quot; Widget , &quot; he predicted , will be around for many years as the purple alien character appeals_to new generations of children . &quot; The proof of all_of this will really be how many of the shows that are in syndication this week will also be in syndication in 10 years ' time . I bet you ' Widget ' is. &quot; As for Keefe and Lacey , they may end_up proving the current conventional wisdom on how small boutiques can prosper in the current animation market . The partners have an idea for a new series called &quot; Power Animals &quot; that is based on the 12 characters of the Chinese zodiac . And they hope to market it to stations in conjunction with a toy company .</TEXT>
