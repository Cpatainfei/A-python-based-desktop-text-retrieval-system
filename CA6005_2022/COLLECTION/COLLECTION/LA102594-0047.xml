   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; JAPAN LOOKS HOMEWARD -- TOWARD ASIA ; THE SHIFTS IN TRADE AND CULTURE ARE STARTING TO AFFECT RELATIONS WITH THE WEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Japan ' s government ministries to Tokyo ' s trendy youth districts , the scent of change is unmistakable : Japan -- an unquestioned ally of the United States for half a century and a passionate student of Western learning -- is looking_to its Asian neighbors , the East . The end of the Cold_War eased the need for security ties with Washington , and Asia ' s spectacular economic ascent has intensified national debate over Japan ' s fundamental interests . Should it tilt toward its Asian neighbors or stay anchored with the West ? In a sense , the debate goes_to the heart of Japan ' s identity itself , long perched between its traditional culture and modern economic and political development . More_than a century after Meiji Restoration reformists turned West to modernize Japan -- even discussing intermarriage to improve the racial stock -- the identification with Asia is growing , overriding a sometimes bitter history of conflict and colonization . Trade is exploding , growing twice as fast within the region as with the United States in the last five years . Government officials are voicing a growing desire to play a more active political role in the region and are being exhorted to do so by leaders such_as Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed and Lee Kuan Yew , the former Singaporean leader . As a result , more Japanese are beginning to assert an agenda of &quot; Asian values &quot; that could lead to differences with the West over human_rights , labor relations and other issues . Even the sacrosanct security relationship with the United States , a product of the American victory over Japan in World_War_II , is being reviewed . In a recent report to the prime_minister ' s office , a group of defense experts advised supplementing U.S.-Japan security arrangements with new ties to the United Nations and with Asian_nations . And among Japan ' s relentlessly trendy youth , Asia is clearly in_vogue . &quot; Asia is Exciting ! &quot; the young_women ' s magazine Crea declared in a cover story , underscoring the heightened interest in Asian languages , food , dance and travel -- even boyfriends . &quot; Now when the once overwhelming U.S. presence in the political and economic spheres has diminished somewhat and the Cold_War has crumbled , Asia is definitely assuming greater weight in Japanese policy , &quot; wrote Yoshibumi Wakamiya , an Asahi Shimbun editorial writer . &quot; We may be coming_to a crucial juncture that will finally straighten_out the warp in Japanese views of Asia that goes_back to the Meiji era. &quot; But the deepening ties with Asia do not necessarily mean that Japan is downgrading its relationship with America . The United States remains Japan ' s single largest market and security shield , and Japanese officials vigorously stress that the ties with Asia are not being built at America ' s expense . It is &quot; patently clear that the zero-sum arguments urging Japan to determine which is more important to its interest -- the United States or Asia -- have no meaning , &quot; Foreign Minister Yohei Kono declared earlier this month at the Shimoda Conference , an elite gathering of U.S. and Japanese scholars , politicians , journalists and business_executives . Kono said the U.S. military presence , its long history in Asia and the growing economic interdependence are keys to the region ' s stability and prosperity . The conference , held_in the western resort island of Awashima , devoted its agenda to Japan ' s role in Asia and the impact on U.S.-Japan relations . In a move unprecedented in its 27-year history , Shimoda ' s organizers invited participants from China , Hong Kong , Singapore , South_Korea , Malaysia , Thailand and elsewhere in the region . Gerald Curtis , a Columbia University political_science professor who attended the conference , concurred with Kono . &quot; The question of whether to leave Asia for the West or go_back to Asia from the West is simply not the way people are thinking , &quot; he said . &quot; Business and political_leaders are quite comfortable with the idea of maintaining intimate relations with the United States and having close relations with Asia. &quot; Others see a tilt coming_in Tokyo ' s policies . Asia ' s ascent as an economic superstar and China ' s emergence as an even more formidable military and political power of the future contrast with the growing image of the United States as a declining power saddled with criminals , drug_addicts and lazy workers . One of Japan ' s time-honored proverbs advises to &quot; move with the powerful , &quot; and that , to some , spells Asia . &quot; I believe Japanese officials and the mass media are preparing the public for a disengagement from the United States in favor of the United Nations and Asia , &quot; argued Chalmers Johnson , president of the Japan Policy Research Institute and former University of California political_scientist . Johnson cites Japan ' s solicitous policy toward China , the recent defense report urging new security ties with Asia and the tremendous economic resources being poured into the region as evidence . Whether he is right or wrong , such Look East sentiments are being increasingly aired . A current bestseller , for instance , urges Asian_nations to form a regional &quot; yen bloc , &quot; saying that Japan can survive without America . More sensational than specific , &quot; The Era of the Asian Yen Bloc : Farewell , America , &quot; by nationalist writers Shoichi Watanabe and Eikan Kyu , has nonetheless sold 100 # 000 copies in three weeks , a phenomenal performance by Japanese standards . Officials too are more willing to directly challenge U.S. leadership . At the recent Shimoda Conference , Japanese officials repeatedly insisted that they are becoming more assertive . But asked how , exactly , they want to assert themselves in Asia and with the United States , they had no ready answers , conferees said . &quot; The Japanese are quite ready to say no , but the question is , what do you say after no ? What constructive policies do you suggest ? They ' re not there , &quot; said Curtis , the Columbia professor . &quot; There is such a dearth of ideas and fresh thinking about what Japanese policies should be about anything. &quot; Tatou Takahama , a senior fellow with the Yomiuri Research Institute , reluctantly agreed . &quot; I have to admit the Japanese participants failed to provide clear answers , &quot; he recently wrote . &quot; It is quite unlikely that the Japanese participants will be able to come_up with impressive ideas on what role Japan should play in the Asia-Pacific region . . . because the majority of the Japanese are still hoping to maintain the status quo. &quot; At a time when wartime suspicions still limit Japan ' s political role , officials say the country ' s foremost contribution in Asia should be economic , leading the region toward greater prosperity . On this score , Japan has performed spectacularly , analysts agree . Japan is now Asia ' s main source of loans , technology and foreign_aid , and has provided the model of close government-business coordination that other Asian_nations have successfully followed . Since the late 1980s , Japanese manufacturers have shifted their offshore production in Asia from domestic products to those requiring higher_quality for the world export market . As a result , they have passed_on valuable skills in quality_control and other management methods to Asian employees . Asia now accounts_for 34 % of Japan ' s imports and 37 % of its exports , surpassing the United States in the latter category since 1991 . Japanese manufacturing investment in North_America plunged from $ 9.1 billion in 1988 to $ 4.1 billion in 1993 but rose in Asia from $ 2.3 billion to $ 3.6 billion during that same period . &quot; The most important fact of post-Cold War Asia is the degree to which it has been tied together by Japan , &quot; said Johnson , the research institute president . But he and Curtis argue that Japan must go beyond supplying loans , know-how and technology . Japan ' s most important role in Asia , they argue , is to offer its market as a replacement for the vast and open U.S. market to absorb the region ' s products . Japanese officials say they are doing just that . Imports from Asia grew from 28 % of the total in 1985 to 34 % in 1993 . Moreover , the proportion of manufactured imports increased from 7 % in 1980 to 41 % in 1993 , according to government figures . No longer simply importing raw_materials , Japan is now buying Korean steel , Taiwanese computer components , Malaysian televisions and Chinese apparel . Johnson , however , argues that Japan is not opening its markets fast enough , nor making enough headway in cutting the morass of red_tape that tends to keep_out new competitors . Japan ' s strategy invariably invites comparisons with its World_War_II &quot; Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere &quot; campaign to free Asia from white colonialists and enrich the region -- a slogan that Tokyo used to justify its own plunder and colonization . But Japan ' s current activities bear important differences -- not the least of which is the eager demand for them by Asians themselves . &quot; I believe on balance Japan is making the right move to quit identifying with Europeans or Americans as honorary whites , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; Japan ' s beginning to find its place in Asia , and its talk_of Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity -- not built at the point of bayonet but on true prosperity -- is as idealistic as the European Union. &quot; Foreign relations are trickier . Japan ' s wartime deeds still rankle in Asia , inhibiting policy-makers here from trying to assert much political leadership . The most notable exception is Japan ' s activities in Cambodia . Using the nation as a diplomatic testing ground , Japan sponsored the international conference on Cambodia ' s reconstruction in 1992 , pledged the largest amount of aid and sent volunteers to U.N. peacekeeping efforts there . U.S. analysts are scrutinizing Japan ' s diplomacy with China to watch for signs of tilt . They say the most notable sign was its disagreement with the United States over linking China ' s trade benefits to its progress in human_rights . Curtis said Japan ' s lack of support was one reason the Clinton_Administration abandoned its policy to link the two . Such behavior contrasts sharply with the past , when Japan essentially followed Washington ' s dictates . In general , most analysts agree , Japan ' s new assertiveness in Asia does not appear to conflict with the United States . &quot; The good news for Washington is that when the Japanese decide on_their_own , they pretty much end_up where we are , &quot; Curtis said . The area where the two nations still share the deepest ties is in security . The United States still guarantees Japan ' s defense , but both sides are beginning to question those arrangements . In a report for the RAND Corp. ' s National Defense Research Institute last year , Francis Fukuyama and Kongdan Oh said &quot; both the alliance and the broader U.S.-Japan relationship are experiencing a number of strains that will likely necessitate modification of the relationship. &quot; The end of the Cold_War dissolved the mutual threat and ideological glue holding the two sides together , and the more Japan tilts toward Asia , &quot; the more likely it is that the common_sense of purpose will be lost , &quot; the report said . U.S. analysts posed similar questions at Shimoda , asking why the United States should continue to defend Japan and guarantee the region ' s stability . Many cite U.S. economic interests as a major rationale -- but only if Americans are given a fair share of the region ' s growing economic pie . The situation is beginning to invite provocative debate . &quot; The security treaty only makes_sense if it is used as a quid_pro_quo to blast open Japan ' s market , &quot; Johnson argued . A Japanese analyst retorted , &quot; Any hint of looking_at that kind of policy would ignite a sense among Japanese to go toward foolish isolationism or an unfavorable anti-American sentiment. &quot; Sophia University professor Kuniko Inoguchi , who helped compile the defense report recommending that Japan broaden its security ties , is more diplomatic . &quot; It ' s not a zero-sum game . We will keep our biggest emphasis on U.S.-Japan , but at_the_same_time we have to get_along_with the neighbors , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' ve neglected that for the last 40 years , and it ' s high_time we pay our respects. &quot; Japan ' s heightened interest in Asia finds its most pleasant expression in culture , for instance the growing numbers of people here taking_up the food , dance and language of other Asian_countries . Japan ' s image of the rest of Asia has changed drastically from the 1970s , when it was seen as a poor , remote region bout which little was known beyond the popular pandas , Kan Kan and Ran Ran , that China sent as gifts or the plastic &quot; Hong Kong flowers &quot; that decorated Japanese toilets . But in the early 1980s , Asia began getting fashionable . An NHK-TV series on the old Silk_Road linking China to Europe sparked interest in the vast region of Central Asia and triggered a run_on books , photo albums and the_like . By the end of the 1980s , Hong Kong movies , Singaporean pop_music and Southeast Asian gigolos took_over . Tomoka Seki , 25 , reflects the new interest in Asia . She was initially drawn West , studying ballet and French in France for more_than two years . But living there showed her the negative side of Western culture , and the constant questions about where she came from sparked an awareness of herself as Asian , she said . Today , she studies Balinese dancing , Asian art and other aspects of the East . &quot; I ' ve realized not just the West but Asia is also fantastic , &quot; she said . Researcher Chiaki Kitada of The Times Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report . Shifting Trade_Winds Asia occupies more and more of Japan ' s trade while the U.S share is lagging .
