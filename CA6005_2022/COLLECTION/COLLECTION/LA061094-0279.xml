   <HEADLINE> POP NOTES : ELECTRIC CIRCUS ROCK RESURGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Electric Circus in Anaheim is back in business as an original-rock venue for local bands after a three-month hiatus due_to what club owner Allen Ornstein describes as &quot; a major license problem. &quot; Ornstein said that the club , at 314 N . Beach Blvd. , had a temporary entertainment license when it opened last year , but difficulties with local authorities ensued when it tried to get a permanent license . &quot; We never had a problem at the club ; police were never called , &quot; Ornstein said , noting that it took &quot; a lot of work , energy and money spent &quot; to get the Electric Circus back in action . Upcoming shows include the Sun Demons , Rhythm Lords and Barrelhouse tonight , Solomon Grundy and Mighty Smiley on Saturday , the Homewreckers on June 17 and Standing Hawthorn , Tremelo and Psychobud on June 18 . Ornstein plans to devote Fridays to roots music , Saturdays to alternative-rock bands and Sundays to reggae . Wednesdays and Thursdays will be dance-music nights , with disc_jockeys instead of bands . Shows start at 9 p.m. , with admission kept to $ 2 because , as Ornstein put it , &quot; everybody has less money these days. &quot; Instead of using outside promoters , as he did before the licensing difficulties , Ornstein plans to book the shows himself . Information : ( 714 ) 826-9686 . * A budding science career has been put_on hold so the Offspring can further its budding career in punk_rock . Bryan Holland , the singer and songwriter of the Orange County band , says he has taken a two-year leave_of_absence from USC , where he was six months into thesis research for a doctorate in microbiology . Holland ' s time has been in_demand lately with the band , which has ridden its alternative radio hit , &quot; Come Out and Play , &quot; onto the Billboard Top 200 albums chart -- the first album on an independent label by an Orange County rock_band to do so since Stryper came_along back in the ' 80s . &quot; I was cloning a mouse retrovirus , the same family as HIV , &quot; said Holland . &quot; Right now there ' s just no way I could give it the ( needed ) commitment . It gets more and more hectic every week . I was trying to do experiments , and it just wasn ' t working out. &quot; The Offspring will play to its biggest audience ever Saturday at the KROQ Weenie_Roast at Irvine Meadows . The rest of the summer is booked with tours of the United States and Europe .</TEXT>
