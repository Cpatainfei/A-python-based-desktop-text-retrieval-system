   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; WORK BEGINS ON QUAKE-DAMAGED VALENCIA LIBRARY ; RECOVERY : OFFICIALS SAY THE BUILDING COULD BE CLOSED FOR UP TO EIGHT MONTHS TO REMOVE ASBESTOS AND RESTORE THE INTERIOR . BRACING WILL BE ADDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Repairs began Thursday on the earthquake-damaged Valencia Library , which will be closed for up_to eight months as workers tear out much of the building ' s interior to remove asbestos . Officials had hoped to reopen the 24 # 000-square-foot library , the busiest of the county ' s 87 facilities , within three months after the earthquake ruptured a water_pipe in the building and damaged one-fourth of the library ' s 155 # 000 publications . But Alan Harsen , head of facilities services for the county ' s libraries , said the asbestos must be removed to meet building_codes . The interior of the building , at 23743 Valencia Blvd. , has been stripped nearly bare , except for empty metal bookshelves covered with plastic . The carpet and furniture have been removed because of asbestos contamination . About 40 volunteers and library staff_members worked three days after the earthquake to remove 80 % of the library ' s books , periodicals and other materials , but flooding caused about $ 750 # 000 in damage to those items . &quot; We ' ve lost quite a_few titles simply because they ' re not in print anymore , &quot; said Josefina Reyes , community library manager for the branch . Back files of magazines and government documents were also destroyed . The asbestos removal is expected to be completed in the next 30 days , after which the long process of replacing everything from the carpet to the ceiling tiles will begin . Harsen said additional bracing and other earthquake safety equipment will be installed during the rebuilding . He said bracing installed across the top of the bookshelves before the earthquake kept all_of the shelves upright and prevented more serious damage . Local library employees will work in a trailer next to the building , sorting through cartons containing more_than 100 # 000 books to be placed on the shelves . But Harsen said reshelving may_not start until December and the library probably won ' t be open for six to eight months . The Valencia branch is the only one of the 38 affected by the earthquake that remains closed , Harsen said . Santa Clarita residents are left with two much smaller branches in Newhall and Canyon Country , each open three days a week . A bookmobile and children ' s story program may be established at a temporary site near the Valencia Library , said Evelyn MacMorres , regional administrator for the north county libraries . The Newhall Library , at 22704 9th St. , is open from 1 to 8 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays , and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays . The Canyon Country branch , 18536 Soledad Canyon Road , is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays , 1 to 8 p.m. on Wednesdays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays .</TEXT>
