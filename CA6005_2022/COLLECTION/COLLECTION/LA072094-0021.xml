   <HEADLINE> NO CHOICE FOR HOSPITALS ; MEDICAL_SCHOOLS -- EVEN THOSE OPPOSED ON RELIGIOUS GROUNDS -- MAY SOON BE FORCED TO TEACH ABORTION TECHNOLOGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A while back , I overheard a conversation between two young physicians in residency training . One was an enthusiastic feminist fresh from medical_school , eager to begin practicing her pro-choice beliefs . The other , a war-weary veteran , said that she would not be doing any more abortions . &quot; I support a woman ' s right to choose , &quot; she said . &quot; But yesterday I aborted a baby , and it tore me up . You could see his little_fingers and toes . . . . &quot; There is real concern in the pro-choice community that doctors will not be available to meet the future demand for abortions . Though most physicians support choice in theory , many are turned_off by the abortion procedure itself . Some nurse-practitioners have proposed that they or others be permitted to do first-trimester abortions to take_up the slack . But there ' s a problem with this . According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute , statistics from 1988 , the latest year available , indicate that 167 # 680 , or more_than 20 % of abortions in this country are done after the first trimester . Second- and third-trimester abortions require considerable surgical training and expertise : In the third trimester , for example , one technique involves evacuating the brain contents from the skull in utero and compressing the emptied skull to facilitate vaginal delivery . ( Termination of the third-trimester child must be carried_out in utero , as termination after live delivery is against the law. ) To meet the expanded need for abortions , the Residency Review Committee for Obstetrics and Gynecology , which accredits training_programs for obstetrics and gynecology specialization , has proposed that residency-training programs in ob / gyn must provide broad training in abortion technology . But what if the training institution ' s religious or ethical beliefs forbid the taking of a human life , in or out of the womb ? Although individual residents can forgo abortion training for ethical reasons , there is no such &quot; conscience clause &quot; for the training hospital or institution . More_than 1 # 000 protest letters have been received by the residency review committee since the proposal was announced last October . A spokesperson says these objections will be taken into consideration when its subcommittee meets this week in Laguna Niguel . A compromise has been proposed by the committee wherein training institutions with moral objections to teaching abortion skills can refer trainees to other institutions that don ' t object . Well , on a moral plane , this won ' t work either . It would be tantamount_to refusing to turn_in a Jewish family to the Gestapo , while making_sure someone else with a less tender conscience did so . The family would still be killed , and the first_person morally culpable . When we talk_about physician-training institutions that object to abortion , we ' re talking mainly , but not exclusively , about Catholic hospitals . There are about 600 of these hospitals , often in underserved areas . Fifty of them have training_programs in obstetrics / gynecology . Three medical_schools also are Catholic institutions . None of these will participate in the active taking of a life , at any stage . Should they be forced to do so to qualify for accreditation , they will most likely close_down their ob / gyn programs . Obstetrics and gynecology has been defined as an important primary-care specialty . The loss of 50 programs would adversely affect medical_care for many of the more_than 50 million people Catholic hospitals serve each year . Without obstetric and gynecologic training for their students , medical_schools cannot be accredited , and most clinical training of medical_students is done through affiliated residency programs . How would the mighty AMA feel about three medical_schools biting the dust ? And it may_not stop there . Will Catholic institutions in the future be forced to provide &quot; euthanasia training &quot; to be accredited ? Will family medicine and surgery residency-accreditation committees also require mandatory abortion training ? And if institutions that still believe life is a good thing are forced_out of the field of medical education , how can medical_students or their teachers have a &quot; choice &quot; that meets their own moral expectations ? Remember , the student who wishes to learn abortion techniques can easily choose to train at one of the many hospitals that have such programs in place . Though Catholic institutions aren ' t politically correct these days , freedom_of_religion is still a national value . The proposed requirements for training , inasmuch as they are under the aegis of an institution with broad public responsibilities , are a clear affront to this freedom . Leaving religion aside , there is still this in the Hippocratic oath , to which we doctors have sworn for two millenia before it was abridged in 1957 : &quot; I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked , nor suggest any such counsel ; furthermore , I will not give to a woman an instrument to produce abortion. &quot;</TEXT>
