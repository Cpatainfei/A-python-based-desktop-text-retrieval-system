   <HEADLINE> WIVES ALSO KILL HUSBANDS -- QUITE OFTEN ; ABUSE : WOMEN MAKE_UP 40 % OF DEFENDANTS IN SPOUSAL MURDERS , UNDERCUTTING POLITICAL RHETORIC TO THE CONTRARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though O.J. Simpson vehemently denies that he murdered his former wife , his case has provoked media attention about husbands who kill their wives . Coincidentally with the Simpson case , the Department_of_Justice has just released the first detailed empirical study of &quot; murder in families. &quot; It contains surprising information that contrasts sharply with media headlines . The most shocking finding of this study , which analyzed nearly 10 # 000 cases , is that wives murder their husbands far more frequently than press reports would suggests . To put the issue in context , women in_general account_for only about 10 % of defendants charged with all murders . But for all spousal murders , women accounted_for more_than 40 % of defendants . And &quot; among black marital partners , wives were just about as likely to kill their husbands as husbands were to kill their wives. &quot; The real headline of this report , therefore , is that women kill almost as often as men do_in the context of family murders , though men much more often kill strangers -- nearly always other men . The other shocker in this report is that husbands who kill their wives are not treated more leniently than men who kill strangers , despite the media myth to the contrary . Indeed , they were as likely to be charged with first-degree murder , were no more likely to have their cases dismissed or diverted and were as likely to be convicted . Nor were their sentences significantly different , when relevant &quot; case characteristics &quot; such_as prior criminal_record were taken_into_account . Despite this hard data , the myths persist that spousal murders consist almost exclusively of husbands who kill their wives and are then treated leniently by the criminal justice system . Indeed , there is one figure that is missing from this otherwise thorough report : namely , whether women who murder their husbands are treated more leniently than husbands who murder their wives . The author of the report told me that data were available but not compiled . I asked if he would compile it and he did , faxing me new tables that compared the outcome of prosecution based on the gender of the victim and the accused . This previously unpublished analysis undercuts the myth that husbands who kill their wives are treated more leniently than wives who kill their husbands . Wives who kill their husband were acquitted in 12.9 % of the cases studied , while husbands who kill their wives were acquitted in only 1.4 % of the cases . Women who were convicted of killing their husbands were sentenced to an average of six years in prison , while men received an average sentence of 17 years for killing their wives . Sixteen percent of female spousal killers get probation , compared with 1.6 % for males . To be sure , some of the difference may be attributable to gender-neutral factors such_as prior record , provocation or mental_illness . But there is absolutely no support in this data for the claim that husbands who kill their wives are systematically treated with kid_gloves by the justice system . Despite the unexpected data , the Justice_Department press_release buried the politically incorrect information under the following headline : &quot; Wives are the most frequent victims in family murders. &quot; But even that conclusion obscures the real picture : that for all family murders -- which includes killing of parents and children as well as spouses -- 55.5 % of the victims were males and 44.5 % females , and &quot; female defendants were more likely than male defendants to have murdered a person of the opposite sex. &quot; The new data strongly suggest that spousal murder is not primarily a male versus female political issue , as some insist . Instead , it is primarily a psychological issue of pervasive familial violence on all sides , generated by the passions of family interaction . Misdiagnosing this psychological problem to fit into a political agenda will delay its proper treatment and cure .</TEXT>
