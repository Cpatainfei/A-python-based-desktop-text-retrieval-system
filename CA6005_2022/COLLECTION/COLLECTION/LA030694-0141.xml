   <HEADLINE> CANADA DEBATES BUILDING ROAD TO ARCTIC COAST ; NORTHWEST TERRITORIES : LINK WOULD OPEN A HUGE AREA TO DEVELOPMENT , WHICH COULD THREATEN ENVIRONMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This vast , harsh territory covering one-third of Canada is Ottawa ' s poor relation : isolated , underpopulated and living_on federal handouts . There are riches here -- gold , diamonds , copper , lead , silver and zinc -- but temperatures of minus 40 degrees or worse , 10 months of winter and dependence on air transport for moving goods make mining difficult and costly . Nellie Cournoyea and her territorial government want to change all that by slashing a 550-mile road across the central Arctic from Yellowknife to the coast at Coronation Gulf . That would open a huge new area for development , but it also would raise environmental questions . &quot; There is a clear realization that jobs and the economy are priority No . 1 in the 1990s , &quot; said John Todd , the territorial minister of nearly everything , including transportation , economic development and tourism . The Northwest Territories has only 58 # 000 people , most of them Indians , in 1.3 million square_miles . Unemployment is estimated at more_than 16 % , compared to 11.2 % nationally . Half of the jobs that exist are in government and most of the budget comes from Ottawa , the federal capital . One gold mine is operating in the region between Yellowknife and the sea , another is ready to resume production , a base metals project is_on the verge of starting_up and at least one diamond mine may open in the next few years . That could mean a bright future , and an all-weather road probably would attract more development . &quot; The advantage of a permanent road is that it could encourage other companies , &quot; said George Patterson , the territory ' s director of mineral policy . &quot; But it ' s only an option . It ' s being studied because of the number of mines that could come_into production. &quot; The price_tag : $ 450 million , plus another $ 37.5 million for a port near Coppermine on the sea . And a second price_tag : The environmental cost of cutting a road that will be heavily traveled through a pristine wilderness called the Barrens , the home of the musk_ox , caribou and grizzly_bear . That cost remains unknown , environmentalists say , but some believe nature can accommodate development . &quot; There ' s an all-weather road from Yellowknife clear to Edmonton , and if you go a kilometer off that road you are in the wilderness , &quot; said David Livingstone , director of renewable resources and the environment for the federal_Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . &quot; I agree that road access opens_up a whole new scale of impacts , but I still think that , with careful management , we can have both. &quot; Still , there are real dangers for the great wilderness , most of it north of the tree_line . It is a rocky tundra dotted with lakes , where polar_bears , Arctic_foxes , wolves and wolverines also roam . &quot; The road will change the face of that country , &quot; said Steven Matthews , a wildlife biologist for the territorial Department of Renewable Resources . &quot; The No . 1 issue is the grizzly , because . . . they require large tracts of undisturbed land. &quot; Other issues include the impact on migration of the Bathurst caribou herd , Canada ' s largest , and the effect of icebreaking for the Coppermine port on inter-island migrations of Peary caribou . Cournoyea is trying to sell the road project to Ottawa as a moneymaker . &quot; There is no doubt that opening access to the region will stimulate further exploration and development work , &quot; she said in her pitch last year . She estimated the net increase in the Canadian gross_domestic_product from new mines at $ 13.5 billion , new employment at more_than 210 # 000 person-years , new income_taxes at $ 1.2 billion and exports at $ 11.25 billion . Above all , from her standpoint , much of that new money would remain in the north . The Lupin gold mine 280 miles north of here regularly builds and maintains a winter road from Yellowknife at its own expense . This &quot; ice road &quot; across the frozen lakes and tundra is open about two months and is used to bring_in a year ' s worth of supplies . Other companies pay tonnage fees to use it . Metall Mining Corp . is finishing a feasibility study for a base metals mine at Izok Lake , 210 miles from the coast . The company needs a road to Coppermine and a port . Territorial officials fear that , if Metall Mining builds a road only from Izok Lake to the coast , all_the benefits will be exported , leaving Yellowknife and the rest of the territory with nothing . Noting that the the federal_government ' s reaction to Cournoyea ' s road proposal has been cool , territorial legislator Michael Ballantyne said : &quot; There is no spare change around anymore . It will probably have to be a combination of public and private participation. &quot; Once a road is built across the Barrens , people will use it -- not only mining_companies , but tourists , hunters and fishermen . For some , that raises another fear . &quot; I don ' t think they should build it , &quot; said Jonas Sangris , chief of the Yellowknife Dene Band , one of many Indian groups struggling for self-government on traditional lands . &quot; There ' s going_to be too many people up there. &quot;</TEXT>
