   <TEXT> &quot; Just say no. / Just use a condom. &quot; &quot; Wait until you ' re older. / Everybody ' s doing it. &quot; The messages teen-agers receive about sex today are confusing . The result is a lost generation . Many teens have never received explicit guidelines regarding sexual behavior and , therefore , are setting their own standards . The statistics on teen sexuality indicate that too many parents are not teaching their teen-agers to be responsible and that the educational system is not doing its job in this subject . According to a 1993 issue of Christianity Today magazine , every year , 1 million teen-age pregnancies occur and about 2 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) are reported . Today ' s teens also have to worry about disease more_than their parents did : 20 years ago , there were four types of STDs among teens ; today there are 30 , including the deadly AIDS virus , HIV . Among 14 to 23 year olds , AIDS has increased 72 % in the past two years , the magazine says . There are , however , solutions to the problem of premarital sex . First , sex education needs to revamped , the message needs to be clarified . To promote abstinence and then hand_out a condom is bewildering . Condom distribution cannot replace sex education . Condoms are a bad idea and a dangerous cop-out . Among the general population , the magazine says the failure rate of condoms is 15 % . Among teens , it is 18 % to 20 % . Even if properly used , condoms are not 100 % effective against preventing transmission of HIV . Not only do they give users a false sense of security , but condoms also send the message that teens have no control over their sexual_urges . Arming teens with the facts isn ' t enough . They must also be empowered by teaching abstinence and how to handle peer pressure . Only 17 % of girls planned their first intercourse , the magazine adds . This suggests that a vast majority were pressured into having_sex . If females ( and males ) were taught to handle high-pressure situations , they could become more comfortable asserting themselves and refusing sex . Abstinence seems like an old-fashioned idea but it is still applicable in modern-day life . Sexual abstinence is not only practical , but also gives a feeling of freedom -- freedom from worry about disease , pregnancy , and most of all , the loss of respect that can result from premarital sex . This respect issue seems to be largely ignored in sex education . Sex is supposed to be the ultimate expression of love between two people who have high respect for one another . But too often sex becomes exploitation , used to gain power and status . A recent example is the Lakewood Spur Posse scandal , where young_men accumulated &quot; points &quot; by sleeping_with a number of young_women . These women were used , then discarded . They were stripped of their dignity as they became another &quot; point. &quot; Young_men should learn that a woman is a human_being , not an object . Both sexes should have enough respect for themselves that they do not need to prove their worth by sexual_activity . My advice to parents and educators : Teen-agers need your support and guidance . We deserve your respect and do not enjoy being stereotyped as hormone-driven sex fiends . Unless these conditions are met , no amount of education will curb the spread of disease or reduce the number of teen pregnancies . My advice to my fellow teens : Respect yourselves and just say no .</TEXT>
