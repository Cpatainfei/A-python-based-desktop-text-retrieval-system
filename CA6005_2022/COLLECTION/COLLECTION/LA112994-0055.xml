   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : BREA ; VOLUNTEERS TO PREPARE GIFT BASKETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the 37th year , needy families will receive holiday food baskets and toys from the Brea Community Emergency Council , a volunteer organization supported by local service_clubs , PTAs and merchants . &quot; It ' s a wonderful group , &quot; said Judy Campos , who manages the city of Brea ' s human services division. &quot; They ( the volunteers ) assist all year round , just not with the baskets . They do everything from paying utility bills and prescriptions to buying eyeglasses. &quot; The city works with the Emergency Council , Campos said , by screening people who have applied for assistance . To be eligible for the holiday baskets , applicants must live_in Brea and show proof of financial need . &quot; We use the same income criteria that the schools use for their hot lunch program , &quot; Campos said . Applications for the holiday baskets are being accepted through Dec . 9 . Volunteers will begin assembling the baskets at 5 p.m. Dec . 15 in Pioneer Hall at Elm Street and Madrona Avenue in Brea . Among the workers will be city employees , high_school students , Scouts , service_club members and the Active Christians Today group from St . Angela Merici Catholic_Church . &quot; It ' s a very rewarding experience , &quot; said Emergency Council president Jill Kimble . Contents of the baskets are determined by the sizes of families and the children ' s ages , Kimble said . Names of recipients are kept confidential . Kimble said it takes about $ 5 # 000 to pay_for the food baskets . The nonprofit Brea Foundation has supported the holiday program for the past two years , and merchants are solicited for donations . Information on applying for holiday baskets or assisting the Emergency Council is available from the city Community Services_Department , at ( 714 ) 990-7776.ALAN EYERLY</TEXT>
