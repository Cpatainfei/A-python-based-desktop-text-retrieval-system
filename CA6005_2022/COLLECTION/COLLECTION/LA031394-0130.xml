   <HEADLINE> WHY ' THREE STRIKES ' MAY TAKE CALIFORNIA FOR A RIDE ; ACT OF FISCAL RECKLESSNESS MAY YIELD TO THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Would that complex and seemingly intractable problems like crime , welfare fraud and deteriorating schools were amenable to quick and facile solutions . A simple idea embodied by a catchy phrase , a stroke of the governor ' s pen , and , presto , the problem is_on the road to solution . Alas , it ' s not so easy . But no one seems to have told our state leaders . &quot; Three strikes and you ' re out &quot; is now law in California . Last week Gov . Pete Wilson signed the first of several bills destined for his desk , imposing life prison_terms without the possibility of parole for three-time felons . The notion of incarcerating for life incorrigible criminals has enormous appeal ; indeed , we support a much more precisely targeted -- and fiscally responsible -- version of the idea . But the bill passed_by the Legislature with blinding speed -- and promptly signed by the governor amid much talk_about getting &quot; tough &quot; on crime -- is anything but a reasoned , promising new tool to stop the bloodshed in our streets , homes and schools . It is , instead , an act of fiscal recklessness on the part of this state . And from first reports , it ' s a law already yielding to another sadly familiar law : the Law of Unintended Consequences . The three-strikes law casts far too wide a net . The law defines as &quot; strikes &quot; a number of felonies , most but not all_of which involve violence or attempted violence . ( One of the first felons to be charged under the law is a man who allegedly wrested 50 cents from a homeless man. ) Individuals who have repeatedly committed serious , but not always violent , crimes like residential burglary or selling drugs to a minor could be imprisoned for the rest of their lives . As a result , California ' s prison population of 120 # 000 inmates , already the largest of any state , easily could swell to more_than double_over the next 30 years . And while there is no clear evidence that this new law will deter crime , there is plenty of reason to believe that it will gridlock the criminal justice system through more and longer trials and fiscally contort California . Wilson ' s own Department of Corrections , in recent weeks , estimated that &quot; three strikes &quot; may cost as much as $ 5.7 billion annually by 2030 . But reliable cost estimates were unavailable , or seemingly were considered of no consequence by lawmakers , as the bill sped to passage . The Legislature and especially the governor , who values his reputation as a tough fiscal manager , have been inexcusably vague about exactly how this financially strapped state can afford to maintain an estimated 275 # 000 prison inmates to their graves . Where will the billions of dollars come from ? Will some college campuses , hospitals , libraries and schools be closed so new prisons can be built ? Will children be denied schoolbooks or immunizations so the necessary prison_guards can be hired ? Will some laid-off Californians get no unemployment relief or job training in_order to create the perverse welfare system this law calls_for -- one that , as Wilson said , will &quot; turn career criminals into career inmates &quot; ? The unseemly haste of the Legislature and the governor in enacting &quot; three strikes &quot; may be only the first act of a long-running crime-control drama this year . Other versions of &quot; three strikes &quot; are now moving through the Legislature , and backers of a tough &quot; three strikes &quot; ballot initiative seem unsatisfied with the bill Wilson signed . Even more troubling are Wilson ' s plans to move well beyond the &quot; three strikes &quot; concept and to seek passage of bills that would put first-time rapists and child_molesters in prison for life without the possibility of parole . These crimes are indisputably detestable but , apart from the truly incalculable expense such proposals would entail , would it be just or appropriate to impose such harsh punishment for a first offense ? Would it be constitutional ? Would it be cost-effective ? Would it deter others from committing crimes ? Crime is a problem in California , a deadly serious one . But addressing it calls_for more_than forceful speeches and fist-pounding . We need carefully targeted and fiscally responsible laws that are less likely to run_afoul of that infamous Unintended-Consequences Law .</TEXT>
