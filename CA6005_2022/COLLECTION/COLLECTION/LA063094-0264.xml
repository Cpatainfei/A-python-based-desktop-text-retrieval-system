   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; COUNCIL REVOKES CITY DISABLED-ACCESS CODE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cutting red_tape for developers and architects , Thousand Oaks council_members have revoked seven disabled-access policies that either conflicted with or replicated federal law . The policies , enacted in 1989 , were designed to make the city as accessible as possible to disabled residents or visitors.They detailed , for example , where builders should place parking_spaces for the physically handicapped , when developers should build wheelchair ramps and how engineers should design curb cuts . But when the state of California adopted new Disabled Access Regulations this spring , city officials deemed their own codes unnecessary . &quot; We had created a unique little circumstance in our city ( by imposing a separate set of rules on developers ) , &quot; said Barry Branagan , director of building and safety . &quot; We were really being silly by creating another layer -- even if it was just a perceived layer -- of bureaucracy. &quot; A_few of the city ' s now-rescinded rules were stricter than the state law . For example , Thousand Oaks had required that the grout between bricks be absolutely flush with the top of the brick , whereas California law allows a quarter-inch of slippage . But Mike Taylor , who sits on the city ' s disabled access advisory panel , said he thought the state laws will adequately protect all residents , including wheelchair users like himself . &quot; This is just going_to make things easier for people to interpret , &quot; he said . &quot; Instead of having a double ( city and state ) law , one law will be the only law. &quot; The council voted 4 to to rescind the policies . Councilwoman Elois Zeanah was absent . STEPHANIE SIMON</TEXT>
