   <TEXT> Amid a cacophony of distant sirens , helicopters and sputtering gas_mains , Caltech earthquake geologist James F . Dolan was taking testimony from the bowed picket_fences , whip-snaked foundations and buckled sidewalks north of the epicenter of Monday ' s 6.6 earthquake . The evidence he collected told a story of how in a pre-dawn instant the full force of the Northridge quake surged up from a point 10 miles beneath the ground to break the surface almost two miles north , in the front_yards of a_few suburban households in Granada Hills . His findings also seem to indicate that a complex web of several faults -- rather than a single one -- were involved in Los Angeles ' largest temblor in modern history . This is urban geology on the fly , the art of reconstructing seismic mechanisms forever hidden deep in the earth . From cracks in the asphalt , broken pipes and crumbled paving stones , Dolan identified what appeared to be a half-mile string of cracks and buckles several blocks north of the Simi Valley Freeway and one block south of the Mission Hills fault . As far as anyone could tell so far , it was the only point where the earthquake literally surfaced . In the widespread rubble left by the violent pre-dawn seismic spasm , the distinctive zig-zag imprint was easily overlooked . But Dolan , picking his way through debris in a battered pair of Italian hiking boots , had no trouble tracing the rupture , following the telltale signs like a trail of small crumbs dropped_in the suburban wilderness . In a gaping hole in the middle of Balboa Boulevard , it was evident to Dolan that gas_mains and water_pipes had been shoved together , crumpled and then jerked apart . Water bubbled from the gas_main and the heady reek of gas spewed from the water_main . Two blocks away on Amestoy Avenue , the action of the rupture shoved Cindy Carter ' s house off its foundations and displaced one end of the hedge by her front_door two feet to the west . Nearby , in front of Harold O ' Hallorn ' s modest ranch_house on Flanders Street , it buckled the sidewalk and popped the curbstones . Dolan surveyed the site and told the two homeowners : &quot; This is where all_the energy of that earthquake came_to the surface . I think you guys are at the proverbial ground zero . &quot; The upshot of all this , &quot; Dolan said , &quot; is that the back of the house on that side of the street and the back of that house across the street are a foot closer. &quot; Based on preliminary analysis , the evidence seems to suggest the quake involved the Mission Hills Fault , which runs north of the 118 Freeway . The easternmost portion of the extensive Oak Ridge fault system , which runs west to the sea , was the actual source of the vertical thrust that generated the quake , seismologists believe . This implicates a new portion of the intricate pattern of faults underlying the Los Angeles basin . At the Caltech Seismological Laboratory on Tuesday , scientists said the aftershock pattern also could involve portions of the San Fernando and Santa Susana fault zones . They even held_out the possibility that last week ' s swarm of earthquakes in Santa Monica could have been precursors to the Northridge quake . They believe the actual stretch of the Oak Ridge fault system responsible_for the Northridge quake is an offshoot called the Frew Fault , which apparently has not been_active for half a_million years . Caltech seismologist Kerry Sieh described the 20-million-year-old Oak Ridge Fault in the San Fernando Valley as very steep , capable of rupturing in a quake as strong as Monday ' s temblor about every 200 years . Seismologists Egill Hauksson of Caltech and Ken Hudnut of the U.S. Geological Survey cautioned that all_of the ideas about what faults may have been involved in Monday ' s quake were still only informed speculation . It may be months before scientists and earthquake experts like Dolan can assemble their educated guesses , insights and seismic data into anything resembling a complete picture of what happened so deep beneath surface in a_few seconds Monday morning . In the end , scientists hope that the information will give them an important insight into the inscrutable mechanisms driving the Pacific Plate past the North_American plate and elbowing Los Angeles on its slow journey north past San Francisco to Alaska . Earthquakes caused by thrust_faults , like the one thought to be responsible_for the Northridge quake , are especially difficult to analyze because they rarely cause any rupture on the surface . Compared to the dramatic fissures left in the aftermath of other earthquakes , the narrow rupture Dolan mapped Tuesday is no more_than a snag in the earth ' s fabric . But to geologists trying to penetrate the veil of asphalt and concrete that normally masks clues to the dozens of faults buried deep beneath the Los Angeles basin , it may be invaluable . &quot; All these faults are paved , &quot; Dolan said . &quot; In order to get access to the earthquake history normally , we have to dig_up city streets. &quot; As Dolan tramped through the debris around Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills , he crossed paths with half_a_dozen senior state geologists studiously working the same area like field analysts trying to decipher the sedimentary bedding of the Grand_Canyon . The small scars in the earth they were mapping will become the raw_material for heated scientific arguments in the weeks to come . &quot; A big earthquake like this really is a schizophrenic experience for us seismologists , &quot; Dolan said . &quot; It is really exciting scientifically , but the exhilaration of trying to understand what nature is doing wears_off when you are staring at buildings that collapsed and killed people. &quot; Times staff writer Kenneth Reich also contributed to this story . Finding_Faults Some scientists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey say Monday ' s Northridge earthquake probably occurred in the Oak Ridge Fault system . One quake geologist , Caltech ' s James Dolan , on Tuesday found a half-mile surface disturbance on the Mission Hills Fault in Granada Hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway and about two miles north of the epicenter in Northridge . Other scientists reported hat aftershocks have been occurring in two other fault zones , the Santa Susana and the San Fernando . These findings indicate that , as with several recent big quakes in California , more_than one fault may have been involved Monday .</TEXT>
