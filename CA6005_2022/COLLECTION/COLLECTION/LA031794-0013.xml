   <HEADLINE> NEWS BITES : FLORIDA TAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brown_sugar is ordinary refined sugar granules coated with a film of molasses . Florida Crystals Unbleached Cafe Sugar , on the other hand , is a &quot; minimally processed &quot; refined sugar -- 99.5 % sucrose , rather than 99.9 % -- so technically it ' s a pale tan , rather than brown . But it does retain , along with some trace_elements , a faint molasses-like flavor . The granules are superfine size , so it dissolves more readily than white sugar , and the molasses content also makes_it caramelize faster . In health and gourmet stores ; call ( 800 ) SUGAR-A1 for a store in your vicinity .

The Hardest-Working Man in Pizza In other pizza news , the World Pizza Championships were recently hosted by Italy .

Maestro Bertuzzo twirled two pizzas simultaneously to the strains of James Brown ' s &quot; I Feel Good. &quot; No Pizza Is an Island Domino ' s Pizza has opened in Iceland . The pizza invasion might have come earlier except that all vegetables in Iceland have to be grown in greenhouses located over hot_springs and geysers , because of the country ' s brutal climate and infertile rocky soil .
