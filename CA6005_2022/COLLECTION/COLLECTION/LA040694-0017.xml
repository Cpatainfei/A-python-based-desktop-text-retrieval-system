   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS : CLINTONOMICS IS FAILING THE MARKET TEST ; CLINTON TOOK INCENTIVE OUT OF THE ECONOMY BY RAISING TAX_RATES ; HIS RELIANCE ON LOW INTEREST_RATES RAISES THE INFLATION SPECTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The financial markets are giving us an early test of the Clinton economic_policy , and the results are not promising . President Clinton brushed_off concerns that his program of higher tax_rates and more regulation would hurt the economy . The tax increase , he said , would result in a smaller deficit , which , in turn , would mean lower interest_rates . And the lower interest_rates would provide enough economic stimulation to offset the adverse effects of higher taxes . For a_few months it seemed to be working , but the recent decline in_stock and bond prices has left interest_rates higher than they were when Clinton was inaugurated . Many people are about to dig_into their pockets to pay their higher taxes on April 15 and many will not get their usual refund . This decline in consumer liquidity hits the economy simultaneously with the sharp run-up in interest_rates . Clinton ' s economic_policy is the reverse of Ronald Reagan ' s -- and not because it taxes the rich . Reagan relied_on incentives to push the economy . With incentives driving the economic expansion , the Federal_Reserve was able to keep a tight grip on the money_supply . As a consequence , the economy grew while inflation fell -- a wonderful result . In contrast , Clinton took incentive out of the economy by raising tax_rates , and he regulates extensively . To drive the economy , he relies_on low interest_rates , or easy_money . This policy cannot work , because it results in too_much money being created . The money creation gets the attention of financial markets and the Federal_Reserve , and both raise interest_rates , thus choking_off the one factor driving the economy . When bondholders see a money-driven expansion , they expect inflation to follow in its wake , and they bail_out of their bond holdings . A wave of selling drives down bond prices , which is the same thing as driving_up interest_rates . The Federal_Reserve follows in turn . Its board of governors observes the sell-off of bonds and decides that it must reassure the financial market by raising interest_rates . Higher interest_rates are the Fed ' s way of slowing the growth of the money_supply . However , the Fed is fearful of stopping the economy in its tracks and usually raises interest_rates in a series of small steps that follow behind interest_rate increases in the market . In the meantime , the money that the Fed has already allowed to be pumped out is doing its work expanding the demand for goods and services . But the higher taxes and regulation make the effort necessary to expand supply less rewarding . Consequently , the demand pressure starts pushing_up prices instead of real output . The 1970s proved that high taxes and easy_money make a recipe for economic disaster . This policy boils_down to using inflation to drive the economy . But inflation sets_in_motion contractionary forces of its own -- rising interest_rates . Remember the 20 % prime rate that Ronald Reagan inherited from the stagflation of the 1970s . The 1990s are too soon to be repeating the policy mistake of the 1970s . Bill_Clinton may be too young and inexperienced to have learned the lesson of a money-fueled expansion , but his Treasury_secretary , Lloyd Bentsen , has lived through it before . Why aren ' t any alarms sounding in the Administration ? This question cannot be answered without taking ideology into account . The Clintons believe that Reagan ' s policy benefited the successful , who are going_to do_well in any case , and thus gratuitously worsened inequalities in the distribution of income . Incentives have been ruled_out because they are believed to result in excessive disparities in the distribution of income and wealth . These disparities are not acceptable to egalitarians who believe that a just society is one characterized by equality of result . Therefore , they choose to drive the economy with easy_money , while taxing away &quot; excessive &quot; rewards earned in the market . This ideological approach to economic_policy is never successful . It can work only until the monetary expansion heats_up inflation or expectations of inflation . Clinton , like others before him , believes he can have a successful economy without the incentives that produce successful people . This is a delusion that has harmed us before , and it will again .</TEXT>
