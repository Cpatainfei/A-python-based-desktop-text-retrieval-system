   <TEXT> Suspicion and fear of war returned to South_Korea on Saturday as President Kim Young Sam put his nation ' s armed forces on alert immediately after hearing of the death of North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung . Daily life in both Seoul and the North_Korean capital , Pyongyang , remained normal , however , and officials of the United States , which maintains 37 # 000 troops in South_Korea , said no signs of military movements had emerged and that American forces were not on alert . A Western diplomat in Seoul also said that fears of an imminent military confrontation , or even a significant rise in tensions , were overdrawn . Visual inspections showed that the Demilitarized Zone that separates the North and the South was &quot; quiet , calm and subdued , &quot; he said . &quot; North_Korean soldiers haven ' t even taken modest precautions to increase readiness , &quot; the diplomat said . &quot; Across the board , we are not aware of anything being done to prepare_for military hostilities. &quot; The South_Korean alert for its 625 # 000 soldiers was ordered in response to one that Seoul officials said the North ordered earlier in the day . North_Korea itself made no such announcement . Urging the people &quot; to attend_to your daily life without concern , &quot; Kim Young Sam said the South_Korean government can &quot; safeguard peace . . . under any circumstances . We are_well prepared. &quot; The alert underscored fears of what might happen in secrecy-shrouded North_Korea now that the Stalinist country has lost the only leader it has had since separate governments were set_up in the North and the South in 1948 . Soviet and U.S. occupation forces divided the onetime Japanese colony after World_War_II . The influence of the 1.1-million-strong North_Korean military is expected to increase with the demise of the 82-year-old charismatic leader who claimed , in propaganda , to have liberated Korea from Japan and who in fact launched the bloody 1950-53 Korean_War and a series of terrorist attacks against the South over the years . Kim ' s lifelong goal had been to reunify the country under Communist rule . Communist neighbor China will be one of the countries most affected by Kim Il Sung ' s death . Of the same generation and background as the leaders who have ruled China since 1949 , Kim was personally close to the late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and to current senior leader Deng Xiaoping , who will turn 90 in August . &quot; With the passing_away of Comrade Kim Il Sung , &quot; Deng said in a statement released Saturday night in Beijing by the official New China News_Agency , &quot; the Korean people lost a great leader and I a close comrade-in-arms and comrade. &quot; Historians recall that the last generation of Chinese leaders , Mao and Zhou En-lai on the mainland and Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan , all died during an 18-month period in 1975-76 . Cycles of natural disasters and deaths of elder leaders are viewed_as ominous signs_in Chinese politics . Because of his close personal and generational ties , Kim Il Sung ' s death of a reported heart_attack Friday is sure to increase speculation about Deng ' s own failing health and the ambitions of those who would replace him . The rapidity with which the government released Deng ' s statement Saturday was intended , in part , to quell this speculation by showing that the Chinese leader was up and alert to events , including the death of his North_Korean friend . For the Chinese , another troubling aspect of Kim Il Sung ' s death is that they feel much less comfortable with his eldest son and designated successor , Kim Jong Il , than they did with the father . Despite a public calm about the North_Korean nuclear issue , Chinese officials are known to be very worried about the prospect of a rogue nuclear_power on the Korean_peninsula . The younger Kim , 52 , took what was regarded_as the first_step Saturday toward the dynastic succession that his father had promoted for two decades , as North_Korea announced that he will head a committee to organize a funeral next Sunday . No foreigners will be allowed to attend the funeral , the announcement said . During a mourning period until the rites , Kim ' s body will lie_in state in the Parliament building and all forms of amusement will be banned throughout the country . Memorial rites are to be held_in all offices and factories , it added . Kim Young Sam said he was disappointed that he would not be able to meet Kim Il Sung in what was to have been the first-ever meeting between leaders of the North and the South . He had been scheduled to travel_to Pyongyang on July 25-27 . &quot; ( We ) were prepared to sit_down and discuss peace on the peninsula and the future of the two Koreas . It is sad , &quot; he said . Neither the North nor the South canceled plans for the summit , but staging it appears highly unlikely . Before the summit was announced , &quot; we were worried about all that talk_of war . Then , we were relieved by news of the summit . Now , we are back to worry again , &quot; a businessman visiting Seoul from Pusan said . An elderly pedestrian , who said he fled the North during the Korean_War , said he was worried about &quot; an abrupt incident &quot; occurring . &quot; But who knows ? This may shorten the time for unification. &quot; In Pyongyang , a correspondent for Russia ' s Itar-Tass news_agency reported that citizens were gathering in front of a massive statue of Kim . &quot; Some were crying , &quot; he said . No military movements or police reinforcements were seen , he added . The sudden_death of Kim , who welcomed former President Jimmy_Carter in Pyongyang last month , also interrupted talks that had just begun between the United States and North_Korea in Geneva aimed at resolving doubts about North_Korea ' s suspected development of nuclear_weapons . Carter ' s visit opened the door to both the planned Korean summit and the renewal of U.S.-North Korean talks . Television footage of the meeting with Carter had shown Kim in high spirits and apparent good_health . Carter himself described Kim as alert and well informed . Now visiting Japan , Carter issued a statement urging Kim Jong Il and other North_Korean leaders to &quot; honor the memory of their country ' s ' great leader ' . . . by maintaining the commitment toward peace that ( he ) made 2 1 / 2 weeks ago. &quot; The younger Kim now heads both the armed forces and the Korean Workers ' Party but had not taken_over the third key post in the North -- that of head of government , or president . Kim Il Sung , while retaining the presidency , had turned_over daily operation of the government to his son . Although the United States regularly conducts air surveillance of North_Korea , intelligence information about politics remains little more_than guesswork . Knowledge of Kim Jong Il is even more sparse than insights into how the government as_a_whole works . Possibilities of what may happen range from Kim Jong Il launching a war against the South to consolidate support within the armed forces to a sudden turn toward reform of a stagnating economy that has declined for three consecutive years . In between is the possibility of a power struggle among figures unknown to the West . Pessimists , who outnumber the optimists , believe that the son may be even more unpredictable than the father . Analysts in both Washington and Seoul presume Kim Jong Il will succeed his father . But the big question is for how long . Forecasts for a short reign -- &quot; anywhere from five minutes to five years &quot; -- prevail . Donald P . Gregg , former U.S. ambassador in Seoul , has said that South_Korea ' s history could suggest a potential scenario for the North . Much as in 1960-61 in the South , when an unstable government came_into power only to be ousted a year later by a coup , Kim Jong Il is likely to lead the country briefly and then be ejected by a general , he has said . Kim assumed leadership of the massive military only in December , 1991 . How much influence he has won with the only force capable of holding the country together is unknown . Kim had never served in the army until his father named him to run it . But recently , some analysts have noted that Kim ' s status as his father ' s anointed heir makes him the only possible leader who can bring legitimacy to a new government . To protect its own prerogatives and status , the ruling group needs at least his name , if not his actual decision-making power , these analysts say . A minority of experts have pointed_out that the shroud of secrecy over North_Korea has produced &quot; a tendency to demonize the son and short-circuit careful analysis. &quot; Actually , Kim Jong Il has been associated with attempts to bring_about economic reform since the early 1980s , they say .
