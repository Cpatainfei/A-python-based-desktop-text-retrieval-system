   <HEADLINE> ASSISTANT CURATOR TO SPEAK AT BOWERS ON AFRICAN ART TRADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a doctoral student in anthropology , Christopher Steiner surveyed studies of African art . He found a lot of attention paid to its original use in African society but not a word on how the works make their way to the art markets of Europe and America . He said he believes that is at least partly because African art_dealers and collectors would rather not acknowledge the economic side of their pursuit : the way in which ritual objects are transformed into commodities . Steiner , now assistant curator of anthropology at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural_History ( and an adjunct assistant_professor of art history at UCLA ) , will speak Thursday at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art about his studies of the transnational African art trade , and will screen a documentary_film based on his research , &quot; In and Out of Africa. &quot; Spending 18 months in the Ivory_Coast in 1987 and 1988 , Steiner studied the structure of the trade_in African art objects , and the way in which economic_value is conferred on objects by dealers , based on changing and subjective standards of &quot; authenticity. &quot; A book expanding on his dissertation , &quot; African Art in Transit &quot; ( Cambridge_University Press ) , was published this week . African art &quot; exists in three different worlds , &quot; Steiner said in a telephone_interview : the original world in which they were created and used ; the &quot; middle world &quot; of the African traders , mostly Muslims who feel no connection to ritual religions and see the objects as economic items ; and the world of American and European art markets , where &quot; objects are treated as aesthetic items &quot; divorced from their spiritual content . &quot; Studying the African art trade and the whole issue of authenticity raises issues of racism in this country , &quot; Steiner said , especially regarding attitudes toward the African traders . &quot; Collectors tend to view them as ignorant , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; They call them ' runners , ' &quot; people who &quot; don ' t understand the aesthetic value of what they ' re carrying. &quot; In reality , Steiner said , the African traders are &quot; very much aware of what they ' re doing. &quot; The film &quot; In and Out of Africa &quot; focuses_on a single art_dealer who travels from the Ivory_Coast to New York with a cache of items , often inventing fantastic tales about the objects for dealers . The one-hour documentary was produced in 1991 by Ilisa Barbash and Lucien Taylor , based on Steiner ' s research , and has won numerous festival awards . * Christopher Steiner will speak Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art , 2002 Main St. , Santa Ana . $ 5 , museum members ; $ 7.50 , non-members .
