   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; MUSLIM SHRINE WILL SOON BE GOOD AS GOLD ; A MASSIVE PROJECT TO GILD THE DOME OF THE ROCK HAS WEATHERED RIOTS AND POLITICAL DISPUTES , WITH HELP FROM KING HUSSEIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jordan ' s King Hussein had to sell_off a London villa to do_it . And a high-tech Northern_Ireland firm had to work_through more_than a year of riots , curfews and religious clashes to complete what it calls the largest and most complex electroplating job of its kind ever attempted . But , as 40 Palestinian and foreign workmen put the finishing golden touches_on the ancient , 15-foot-high crescent moon that soon will grace again the top of the third-holiest site of Islam , one of the world ' s most ambitious religious renovation jobs is nearing completion . Next Monday , in a ceremony in Amman , the capital_of_Jordan , far from the 5 # 000 glittering new gold_plates that adorn Jerusalem ' s ancient Dome of the Rock , King Hussein is scheduled to inaugurate the refurbished dome over the sacred shrine that Muslims believe marks the place -- the very rock -- where the Prophet Mohammed departed earth and ascended to Heaven . The fact that Jordan ' s Hashemite king , the official custodian of the Dome of the Rock and financier of its renovation , cannot travel_to the site to commemorate or even gaze upon the product of his $ 8-million investment , says much about the tribulations and politics that have accompanied the restoration , problems rooted in the shrine ' s location . The Dome and the adjacent Al Aqsa Mosque sit in the eye of a political storm that has raged for more_than a quarter of a century around the most disputed piece_of_land in the disputed city of Jerusalem -- the place Israelis call the Temple Mount , and the Muslims call Haram-esh-Sherif . Jews hold holy the Western Wall , which delineates one side of the mount , as a remnant of the temple built by King Herod . The Islamic shrines , which draw millions of Muslim worshipers each year , are , in fact , under Israeli occupation and control in the heart of the walled Old City that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war . It is land that the Israelis have vowed never to relinquish . But the land is also claimed by the Palestinians who lived_in the area through a succession of regimes and administrations that ended with Jordan . Through all_the claims and counterclaims , King Hussein , who is believed by most Muslims to be a direct descendant of the Prophet , remains the uncontested custodian of the Rock , the Dome that covers it and Al Aqsa Mosque . And that is a role so important to the king that he sold_off part of his family fortune to refurbish the treasures , and flatly refused a counter-bid to repair the leaking and sagging dome by King Fahd , ruler of oil-rich Saudi_Arabia and custodian of Islam ' s two other holiest sites in Mecca and Medina . Against this backdrop , Patrick O ' Hare , a veteran of complex Middle_East engineering projects , has successfully navigated through the politics of a city sacred to three religions . He is now nearing completion of a job he considers &quot; the highlight of my career. &quot; For O ' Hare and his Belfast-based Mivan Overseas Ltd. , replating the Dome of the Rock was not just another contract . It was a far greater challenge and far more rewarding , he said , than Mivan ' s last construction contract at Euro Disney . And far more meaningful than the construction of a full-sized replica of the Titanic that his company recently began . Not even the three grand palaces O ' Hare and his firm built for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein came_close , he said . * The challenges of the Dome were largely technical . Never before , O ' Hare said , has a fixed object as large as the Dome of the Rock ever been gold-plated in place . &quot; The process has been used before -- there were a couple domes done like this in California -- but it had never been done on this scale before anywhere in the world , &quot; the engineer said with pride , as workmen in an adjacent pre-fab workshop at the foot of the monument touched_up the golden crescent that will be reinstalled atop the dome on Inauguration_Day . To do the job , O ' Hare ' s company imported two giant cranes , 190 pounds of gold , 1 # 500 new brass sheets and 5 # 000 copper joints from Britain . Mivan also brought_in timber from the West_African country of Gambia to reconstruct the support structure under the dome . Workers imported and assembled on-site the sophisticated electroplating machinery that O ' Hare said accomplished the task at the rate of 40-square-meters per day -- &quot; I ' d like to think it ' s a world_record , &quot; he said . &quot; It was in bad shape , &quot; O ' Hare said of the dome , which was last restored not with gold plating but anodized aluminum in 1956 . &quot; The dome itself was leaking , and the lower structure was falling apart. &quot; One of the greatest challenges was to make_sure the dome wasn ' t too shiny . O ' Hare said the king wanted a traditional look , a &quot; relatively matte finish. &quot; Furthermore , the engineer explained , &quot; if it were a really bright finish , it would be like a mirror off the sun . From a distance , it would look black. &quot; As things turned_out , the politics inherent in the site presented O ' Hare and his workers with surprisingly few complications . &quot; It hasn ' t caused us any major problems , &quot; he said of frequent protest strikes by Palestinian factions that have shut_down most of East Jerusalem and the Old City for reasons unrelated to the work_on the shrine . &quot; We normally work_on the strike days , especially because of the nature of the project . They treat us very well . They give us special VIP treatment. &quot; In fact , O ' Hare added , for the first time in his life he has been stopped on the street and asked_for his autograph , which he routinely signs as &quot; Captain of the Dome Rockers. &quot; The most memorable moment of the operation , O ' Hare recalled , was when his team removed the canvas that veiled the dome during most of the restoration . &quot; People started cheering , &quot; he said , &quot; and it really was very moving. &quot; Few are moved by the sight of the glowing new dome as regularly and as deeply as Sheikh Mohamed Hussein . He is the grand imam at the Dome of the Rock , and his office is just a_few dozen yards from the shrine . &quot; Definitely , it is a beautiful , positive feeling every morning I see it , &quot; he said . &quot; It reminds me I am in al-Quds ( the Arabic name for Jerusalem ) , and it reminds me that I am of Islam . &quot; We are very happy with this , &quot; the imam observed . &quot; We are convinced that this particular plating is the very best money can buy. &quot; And , he said , the work made no significant changes to a shrine that is &quot; the only Islamic landmark that has remained virtually unchanged through all_the centuries. &quot; It was completed in 691 , about 60 years after the death of the Prophet . * What has changed , though , are the political developments that have swirled around the shrine in the seven months since Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed their historic declaration calling_for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories . The Israelis and PLO leaders agreed to discuss the fate of the Old City , that ancient , walled part of Jerusalem that includes the Temple Mount and the Islamic shrines , over the next five years . In the meantime , the violence spawned by that political process have impacted on the Dome of the Rock . The imam said security men have been forced to ban all non-Muslims from visiting the site for more_than a month after a Jewish settler killed about 30 Palestinians inside Hebron ' s Ibrahim Mosque , another holy site shared by both Muslims and Jews . &quot; On the one hand , &quot; the imam said of the restrictions , &quot; it was to protect the Muslims , so they could pray without getting massacred , and also we were afraid that the anger of the Muslims could endanger the non-Muslims who visit here. &quot; But now that the dome is nearly finished , the imam said , the Islamic board that oversees the shrine is reconsidering the ban . &quot; We are hoping to lift the embargo on non-Muslims , &quot; he said , &quot; not because the situation under ( Israeli ) occupation is getting better , but it is because the visitors who come here from so far away must be able to see this beautiful place as it is now. &quot; One man who cannot come , the imam conceded , is King Hussein . Jordan has no diplomatic relations with Israel , and King Hussein says he will not set foot in Israel or the occupied territories until the two nations conclude a peace pact . Imam Hussein said he has no religious objection to the inauguration ceremony that King Hussein plans in Amman next Monday . &quot; King Hussein , because he paid_for this work , has a right to celebrate anywhere he likes , &quot; the imam said . &quot; But we will celebrate only after Israel ends its occupation of our lands . We will not celebrate this renovation . We will celebrate liberation. &quot;</TEXT>
