   <HEADLINE> U.N. PEACE MISSION FLIES TO AFGHANISTAN TO END KILLING ; ASIA : TOLL PUT AT 2 # 500 KILLED AND 17 # 000 INJURED IN KABUL . HALF OF THE CAPITAL ' S POPULATION MAY HAVE FLED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Afghanistan ' s capital reduced to a shell-battered moonscape inhabited by thousands of hungry , homeless people , a U.N. peace mission flew to Kabul over the weekend to try to broker an end to nearly two years of brutal fratricide . &quot; Finding a solution is the main , if not the only , aim of our visit , &quot; the leader of the five-member mission , former Tunisian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mestiri , told reporters on his arrival in Kabul from Pakistan . The visit by the U.N. delegation was prompted by the unparalleled fighting that began in January in and around the mountain-ringed capital -- and the harsh consequences for the civilian population . An estimated 2 # 500 people have been killed and 17 # 000 injured in the street battles , artillery duels and aerial attacks that have raged in Kabul , the International Committee of the Red_Cross said . Although no one knows for_sure , half of the city ' s civilian population may have fled , leaving_behind about 800 # 000 people . Many who stayed have been uprooted by the street-to-street fighting and are living_in overcrowded , unsanitary public buildings . As the weather warms_up , health officials fear outbreaks of cholera and other diseases . &quot; It is clear that several hundred_thousand people living_in Kabul don ' t have a basic income to feed their families and don ' t have regular access to relief supplies , &quot; Martin Barber , acting director of the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan , said in Islamabad , Pakistan . For many , food has become the most pressing need . Warfare has deprived most Kabul residents of their paying jobs and simultaneously kept food supplies out . On Saturday , four private organizations distributed 90 tons of wheat_flour that had been trucked in from Pakistan , Barber said , but that will only provide rations to 25 # 000 people for 10 days . The main belligerents , President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his archrival , Prime_Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a hard-line Muslim fundamentalist , agreed to a cease-fire during the U.N. delegation visit , which should end today or Tuesday . According to U.N. officials , the Tunisian diplomat wants the widest possible exposure to Afghan leaders and ordinary people to see how the United Nations might best help stanch the Afghan bloodshed . After the Muslim moujahedeen took power from a Soviet-backed regime in April , 1992 , ending 14 years of civil_war , a new kind of fighting began -- among rival members of the Islamic coalition government . More_than 11 # 000 people have been killed as a result . Hekmatyar , who has had Pakistani backing , wants Rabbani to resign so an interim government can oversee new elections . The pro-Rabbani Cabinet countered March 25 with a proposed new political setup , whose keystone would be the U.N.-monitored convening of a loya jurga , or great assembly , whose decisions are obligatory for all Afghans . But Hekmatyar held_fast Sunday , telling the U.N. peace mission that Rabbani ' s resignation is the only way to end the fighting .</TEXT>
