   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; LISZT AND CHOPIN FROM FIALKOWSKA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Janina Fialkowska has been playing major works by Franz Liszt in regular appearances here since her first Ambassador Auditorium recital , in 1975 . But never with more authority and conviction than she displayed at her latest Pasadena concert Wednesday night . The Polish Canadian pianist offered an entire half-recital of Liszt pieces , five technical and musical hurdles testing not only bravura and endurance , but imagination and emotional projection as well . Fialkowska conquered all . She lit the inner fires of the &quot; Dante &quot; Sonata as effortlessly as she dominated its mechanical intricacies , reminding us that this is a work of delicacy and poetry as much as it is a potboiler . Before that , she produced irresistible ripples and cascades in &quot; Au bord d ' une source , &quot; sang out the tender rhetoric of &quot; Senza lentezza quasi allegretto &quot; ( from &quot; Apparitions &quot; ) and delivered all_the Romantic enchantment in &quot; Valse impromptu , &quot; after opening the group , and the recital , with the heroic fanfare of the Polonaise No . 2 . This demonstration of comprehensive virtuosity continued after intermission with masterpieces by Polish composers . Szymanowski ' s clangorous but mystical &quot; Metopes , &quot; Opus 29 , showed us contrasting facets in the 42-year-old pianist ' s musical makeup . Chopin ' s B-minor Sonata brought_to mind the old saw , &quot; You don ' t have to be Polish to play Chopin , but it doesn ' t hurt. &quot; Indeed , Fialkowska made every bit of this familiar score her own , individual statement , in particular the wondrous soliloquy of the third movement , the heart of the work . Her first two encores turned_out to be relics of an era before her birth : Myra Hess ' transcription of &quot; Jesu , Joy of Man ' s Desiring &quot; and the &quot; Caprice Espagnole &quot; by Moritz Moszkowski .</TEXT>
