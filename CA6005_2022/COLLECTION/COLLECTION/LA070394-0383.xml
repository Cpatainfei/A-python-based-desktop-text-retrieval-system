   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M . KRISTOF : MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK ; REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS COULD SAVE YOU MONEY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Delores G . had a sizable fortune after her husband died in the early 1980s . But within 10 years , more_than half her $ 500 # 000 cash estate had been lost in a series of speculative investments and financial cons . Rather than blame the con_men and promoters , Delores blames her losses on unreasonable expectations . She says she was a walking mark because she didn ' t know that &quot; safe &quot; investments don ' t promise double-digit returns in times of modest inflation . Delores fell_into a common trap . There are millions of people like her who simply don ' t understand how to gauge realistic investment expectations , experts say . But gauging what ' s reasonable is easy . And it can save investors from costly mistakes and protect them from financial cons . Now , as_many investors take a midyear look_at their investments , they would be wise_to consider whether their investment expectations are realistic in today ' s market . Normally , you can gauge expectations by looking_at rates paid on Treasury securities , says Mark W . Riepe , vice_president of Ibbotson Associates , a Chicago-based investment consulting and data products firm . If your time frame is two years , consider what two-year Treasuries pay . Every percentage_point above the Treasury yield is a step_up in risk , he notes . In other words , if someone is promising a 20 % return at a time when Treasuries are yielding 5 % , you ' re taking a huge risk . However , if Treasuries are yielding 15 % , a promise of a 20 % return might not be inherently dangerous . However , investors in_stock and bond markets should realize that return expectations are long-term by nature . Those who expect to need their money in less than two years should either keep their investments in cash equivalents -- such_as certificates_of_deposit and Treasury securities -- or recognize that they ' re speculating , says Neal Litvack , executive_vice_president of Fidelity Investments in Boston . Why ? Over short periods , the only thing you can reasonably expect of stock or bond returns is that they ' ll fluctuate . Often they ' ll fluctuate wildly . Between 1981 and 1990 , for example , the variation between the best and worst years in these markets was 37 % for stocks and 44 % for bonds , according to T . Rowe Price , a mutual_fund company headquartered in Baltimore . In other words , if your time horizon is short , you should expect to earn modest returns -- a_few percentage_points over the rate_of_inflation -- in safe investments . Or , you can speculate , in which case you could make or lose a fortune . Notably , many investors have forgotten that it is risky to invest in these markets with a short-term horizon because the markets were unusually calm for more_than a decade , says Richard Bernstein , manager of quantitative_analysis at Merrill Lynch in New York . However , now the markets are &quot; reverting to a more normal risk-reward relationship. &quot; Translation : &quot; If you want unusually high returns , you ' re going to have to give_up sleeping at night , &quot; Bernstein says . If you ' re investing in bonds , you need to have at least a two-year time horizon , says Litvack . If you ' re investing in_stocks , you should be committed to stick_with it for at least five years , he says . Those with a long_time frame can take_a_look at that investment category ' s history to determine what a reasonable rate of return should be . Since 1926 , big-company stocks have earned an average compounded rate of return equal_to 10.33 % , according to Ibbotson . Over the same period , small company stocks gained 12.36 % . Long-term government_bonds earned 5.02 % , Treasury_bills averaged a 3.69 % return , and inflation averaged 3.13 % . Because this period included such economically earth-shattering events as the Great Depression , World_War_II , the peak period for U.S. inflation and the &quot; oil crisis , &quot; not to mention the Korean , Vietnam and Persian_Gulf_wars and periods of recession and expansion , it ' s safe to assume that these returns are reasonable through thick and thin . If there ' s a global nuclear war , of course , all bets are off . Otherwise , long-term investors can reasonably expect about a 10 % return in_stocks and at least a 5 % return on government_bonds . Or , to put it another way , you can expect to earn 7 % to 8 % over the rate_of_inflation when investing in_stocks , and you can expect to earn 2 % to 3 % over the inflation_rate when investing in U.S._government bonds , Riepe says . The statistics on international investing don ' t go_back quite as far . However , Ibbotson has tracked global returns since the mid-1970s . Between 1975 and 1993 , a diversified portfolio of international stocks returned 15.75 % . A diversified portfolio of international bonds returned 12.48 % . * It ' s worth noting , however , that U.S. inflation -- and U.S. investment returns -- were higher over this fairly short period than they were in the nearly 70 years noted above . Since 1975 , U.S. inflation averaged 5.53 % , large-company stock returns averaged 14.21 % and returns on U.S._government bonds averaged 10.48 % . As for other investment categories : Tax-favored municipal_bonds earned an average of 3.71 % pretax over a 44-year period , according to T . Rowe Price . However , because U.S. tax_rates dropped_in the mid-1980s , returns on municipal_bonds rose . During the 15-year period ended Dec . 31 , municipal_bond yields averaged 8.39 % . ( Muni bond yields naturally go_in the opposite direction of tax_rates because investors buy them on the basis of after-tax returns . A 5 % municipal_bond has an after-tax return of roughly 7.1 % when you ' re in the 30 % tax_bracket . However , when you ' re in the 70 % tax_bracket , the same bond boasts a 16.6 % after-tax return . that ' s the amount you would have to earn on a taxable investment to have the same amount in your pocket from the tax-free investment. ) Real_estate investment_trusts , meanwhile , returned between 8.7 % and 15.3 % over the past 20 years , depending_on the type of REIT .</TEXT>
