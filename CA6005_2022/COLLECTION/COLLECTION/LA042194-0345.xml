   <HEADLINE> CREDITORS ' BID TO CONTROL LINCOLN MORTGAGE DENIED ; COURTS : BANKRUPTCY JUDGE GIVES FOUNDER SARVAK AT LEAST 90 DAYS TO PREPARE A PLAN TO REPAY $ 30 MILLION LOST IN SECOND TRUST DEED POOL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bid by creditors of bankrupt Lincoln Mortgage and Loan Co . to wrest control of the business from founder Kenneth E . Sarvak failed Wednesday as a federal bankruptcy judge ruled that Sarvak could remain in_charge for at least 90 days while preparing a financial reorganization plan . Sarvak , a 68-year-old real_estate investor , was given until July 13 to prepare a plan to repay creditors who invested more_than $ 30 million into his second trust_deed pool . A court-ordered audit found that Lincoln , based in Newport Beach , holds deeds to about $ 9 million worth of land , leaving investors with a $ 21-million shortfall . Though apparently profitable for Sarvak and its investors for most of its 20 years in business , Lincoln by 1990 had become a victim of the collapsing Southern California real_estate market and of several bad investments . The state_Department of Corporations also alleged in a civil suit filed earlier this year that the company and its investors were defrauded by Sarvak , who allegedly was cannibalizing the company by diverting investment funds to make promised interest payments to investors . Part of Lincoln ' s business was lending investors ' money to homeowners whose credit was not good_enough for them to borrow from a bank . The borrower would take a second_mortgage on the house and , in return , give Lincoln a deed to ensure that the company got its money back . That is known as the hard-money second_mortgage business . If the borrower cannot make the mortgage payments , the lender forecloses and takes the house . Until the company stopped making interest payments late in 1992 , investors earned returns as high as 14 % . Brochures for the company said that each investor ' s name would be recorded in county land records on each deed to reserve the investor a place in_line if the homeowner did not make loan payments and the house had to be sold to pay_off creditors . But records show that many investors ' names were never recorded , so their investments were unsecured by collateral . Through his lawyers , Sarvak has said that the case is a misunderstanding . He never lied to his investors , he said , and the documents he gave them did not require him to record their deeds . The Department of Corporations ' fraud suit , however , says he was required to do so . Though Lincoln apparently flourished during the 1980s , its fortunes declined with real_estate values in 1990 . By November last year , with the company facing a blizzard of lawsuits by disgruntled clients , Sarvak filed for protection from creditors in U.S. bankruptcy court . Federal bankruptcy law has allowed Sarvak to keep control of the company while planning its reorganization but requires court review and approval of significant transactions . Fearful that Sarvak might somehow dissipate Lincoln ' s already diminished assets , the creditors initially had sought to have the company ' s voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code converted to a court-ordered liquidation of assets under Chapter 7 . But after a nationwide telephone conference among themselves Tuesday , the creditors concluded that a liquidation might hurt them if Lincoln ' s land holdings were disposed_of at fire-sale prices . Instead , they asked Bankruptcy Judge John Wilson to leave Lincoln in Chapter 11 but to appoint an examiner to take_over administration of the company , said Emogene Butler , a Newport Beach real_estate_broker and co-chairwoman of the creditors committee . Butler , who said she has invested $ 600 # 000 with Lincoln , said creditors hoped the arrangement would protect the company ' s assets while allowing Sarvak to use his real_estate experience to get the most value out of the properties that the company owns . The examiner , however , declined to take_on the assignment , maintaining that the existence of several other companies owned by Sarvak and involved in separate bankruptcy proceedings would make the situation too complicated . And Judge Wilson agreed that selling Lincoln ' s property in a forced liquidation would almost guarantee further losses to creditors . &quot; As an individual investor , I ' m pleased that he didn ' t order liquidation , &quot; Butler said . &quot; Now we have at least 90 more days for Mr. Sarvak , under court supervision , to figure_out how to get money back without dumping the real estate. &quot; The extra_time could be important , she said , &quot; because there are signs out there that the ( real_estate ) market is coming back. &quot;</TEXT>
