   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; BRITAIN ' S LAVISH D-DAY PLANS LEAD TO BID TO CALL IT ALL OFF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suddenly the long-heralded 50th anniversary of D-day has become as controversial a political issue in Britain as it has elsewhere in Europe . After investing millions of dollars and thousands of hours of planning and preparation to commemorate the Allied invasion of France on June 6 , 1944 , many voices here are suggesting : Let ' s call the whole_thing off . The opposition Labor and Liberal_parties say ceremonies that should commemorate the servicemen who died on that fateful day have been turned_into a celebratory circus by the Conservative government . They claim that the anniversary , which will involve thousands of Americans , is being hijacked by the faltering government of Prime_Minister John Major to capitalize on patriotic good feeling shortly before local and Europarliament elections . The British Defense Ministry ' s initial position was : Nothing special for D-day but a big effort next year for V-E ( Victory in Europe ) Day . But Major , alert to the potential political gain , overruled this view and preparations proceeded apace , some involving the Americans , Britons and Canadians who landed on the Normandy beaches 50 years ago . He decided to have ceremonies with 13 heads_of_state and government from the Allied nations that participated in &quot; Operation Overlord , &quot; as the invasion was known . Tourist boards on both sides of the_English Channel , imagining hotels and restaurants full and cash_registers ringing , joined in to lure veterans and their relatives to the scene of the event that led to the end of World_War_II and the restoration of democracy in Europe . The Defense Ministry was assigned to handle military activities : parades , flyovers , fleet reviews , military museum exhibitions . The Heritage Ministry would supervise the civilian side of the anniversary . About 500 local events have now been planned in Britain alone . But somewhere along the way , planners got carried_away with street parties and booze fests in pubs -- in short , a national celebration to mark the anniversary , and thereby remind the world of Britain at its best . In the last few days , a deep reaction set_in , perhaps triggered by the announcement that the government would sponsor a huge jamboree in London ' s Hyde Park that seemed to have little to do with D-day . The British Legion , a leading veterans group , and the Normandy Veterans ' Assn . vehemently objected to Major ' s description of &quot; celebrations &quot; rather than &quot; commemorations &quot; to remember the thousands killed and wounded in the invasion . The veterans particularly objected to the Hyde Park hoopla , and in their cause they enlisted Dame Vera Lynn , a sweetheart singer who enchanted lonely World_War_II servicemen with &quot; we ' ll Meet Again. &quot; Late this week , after the_matter was raised in an argumentative House of Commons , the government belatedly agreed to solicit advice from veterans groups on how best to observe D-day . Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke , at Major ' s insistence , gave a series of interviews in which he stressed the commemorative nature of the events . And Eddy Hannath , general secretary of the Normandy Veterans ' Assn. , said , &quot; We are happier now than we were last week. &quot; In a public_opinion_poll published Friday , 65 % of those questioned said street parties and fireworks displays would trivialize the anniversary . The poll also showed that one in three did not know what happened June 6 , 1944 .</TEXT>
