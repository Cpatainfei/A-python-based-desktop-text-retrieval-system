   <HEADLINE> 1993 ; AN EMOTIONAL , MYSTIFYING YEAR TOUCHED BY TRAGEDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Real_life isn ' t in the same ballpark with sports when it comes_to playing fair . If something bad happens to you in sports , someone tries to make_up for it . They give you a draft pick , free_throws , five yards , a trip to first_base , a power_play . Real_life doesn ' t play by those rules . It can come_in and just take_over . Especially in a year like this one , it can leave you wondering , as Andrew Young did_in quoting Arthur Ashe ' s lifelong query at Ashe ' s funeral , &quot; Why , oh Lord , why ? &quot; You won ' t find the answer on the scoreboard , which made 1993 so sad and mystifying for anyone with an emotional investment in sports . The world lost Ashe , who made the connection between life and sports better than most people . And there were far too many other occasions to mourn . We were just getting used to the idea of real_life intruding_on sports in the form of big money , labor negotiations , corporate machinations . Then it all hit higher and harder in 1993 . The top sports story , in fact , was rooted in tragedy . Michael Jordan retired after leading the Chicago Bulls to their third consecutive National Basketball Assn . title , largely because he still was reeling from his father ' s murder . * To be sure , triumph also had its day this year . Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue_Jays was its chief spokesman , bounding home after ending the baseball_season with a once-in-a-generation swing . Revivals burst_out all_over . The Dallas Cowboys and Montreal Canadiens recaptured past glory . When history looks_back on ' 93 , it will recall a blistering pennant race in the National League West , a zestful debate over who ' s No . 1 in college football and a madcap heavyweight title fight . Still , problems that would have seemed extraordinary most years looked tame . The New York Mets , for instance , could be said to have experienced the worst year a baseball_team ever has had -- based on expectations , salaries and decorum . Except the Cleveland Indians ' year was much worse . Pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews were killed in a spring_training boating accident that seriously injured teammate Bobby Ojeda . When pitcher Cliff Young was killed in a car accident after the season , Cleveland was asking , why , why ? Ashe had started phrasing that question at age 6 , when his mother died . Eulogists invoked it 43 years later , after pure blind chance gave him the AIDS virus through a blood_transfusion . He was remembered for what he did_in between , to make this kind of scene possible : 1 # 400 people an hour passed his coffin in the state house of Richmond , Va. , a city that once denied him and every_other black child access to its public tennis_courts . &quot; Life , to him , was more_than a moment of triumph , &quot; Sen . Bill Bradley , D-N.J. , said at a memorial service in New York . &quot; It was a gift of time . His was a life well-lived. &quot; As much as anyone , Jordan is larger than life . But he felt the world was forming too tight a circle_around him , what with speculation about his gambling habits . He leaned_on his dad , even asking James Jordan to speak on his behalf during the playoffs . &quot; Makes me feel pretty good , you guys consider me a good substitute , &quot; the elder Jordan said at the time . Michael , stunned , left the stage in the fall , two months after his father was found dead . Basketball already was staggering from the loss of two players in their prime . The New Jersey Nets ' Drazen Petrovic was_on the verge of becoming the NBA ' s first European star when he was killed in an accident on a rain-slickened German road . Reggie Lewis already was a captain and fixture with the Boston Celtics before he collapsed on a practice court in July . Sports generally are spared that grief . But it kept happening . Race drivers Davey Allison and Alan Kulwicki were killed in a helicopter and plane crash , respectively . Jim Valvano , still vibrant as a basketball analyst , died of cancer , as did golf_pro Heather Farr . Houston Oilers lineman Jeff Alm was a suicide victim . Among other former athletes who died in 1993 , were baseball Hall of Famers Don Drysdale and Roy Campanella , whose storied careers were with the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers . Both had heart_attacks , Campanella on June 26 and Drysdale on July 3 . Julie Krone ' s milestone in the Belmont Stakes -- she became the first woman jockey to win a Triple_Crown race -- was shaded by the loss of Preakness winner Prairie Bayou , who broke_down and had to be destroyed . Krone herself , later in the season , suffered severe leg and ankle injuries while racing at Saratoga . Even when life imitated art , the result was tragic . Syosset High football_player Michael Macias was paralyzed when he was hit by a car while trying to copy a scene from the movie &quot; The Program. &quot; At least real_life occasionally pulled its punch , with grim news that could have been much grimmer . Monica Seles is expected to recover from the stabbing she suffered during a match . Paul Azinger , who finally won a major title at the PGA Championship , is given a good chance to fight_off lymphoma . Bobby Hurley , the Sacramento Kings ' rookie point guard , is improving from critical injuries he suffered in a car accident . Krone is expected to ride again . On the other hand , 1993 did provide the more exciting ebb and flow , the unexpected that keeps us tuned_in . You never know how things might fall -- possibly by parachute , which provided a burlesque interlude in Evander Holyfield ' s title decision over Riddick Bowe . You can ' t tell how the ball will bounce -- or if Leon Lett will take a poke_at it . The Mets would just as soon throw_away 1993 . They tossed_out most everything else : threats , fireworks , bleach , a manager and general_manager . It was mostly chaotic and , in the Vince Coleman cherry-bomb incident , criminal . The most infamous throwing was done_by team symbol Anthony Young , with his record 27-game losing_streak . When the streak ended , he said it wasn ' t a monkey off his back , &quot; it was the whole zoo. &quot; Yet the circus kept spinning . New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner returned from a suspension in characteristically tasteful , understated manner . He dressed as Napoleon atop a white_horse on the cover of Sports Illustrated . There was enough life in 1993 to keep a lot of people hoping . There ' s always a chance some kid will be as_good_as George Brett or Nolan Ryan , who said goodbye this year . For them , 1993 was a victory lap . For these people , too : -- Wayne Gretzky overcame back surgery and lifted the Los Angeles Kings to their first Stanley Cup_final . -- Mario Lemieux eclipsed even that . He overcame Hodgkin ' s disease and won the league ' s MVP award . -- A year after he won his first World_Series and four years after it looked as if he were finished , Dave Winfield got his 3 # 000th hit . -- Time was_on Chris Webber ' s side after all . His gaffe in calling a timeout that Michigan didn ' t have was costly in the NCAA final , but he was lauded only a_couple_of months later when he became the top choice in the NBA draft . -- Barry Bonds matched pay with productivity , sending the seemingly overmatched San Francisco Giants to 103 wins , only one short of the Atlanta Braves . -- Greg Norman , The Guy Who Always Chokes , won the_British Open . -- Paul Molitor , a good and unheralded soldier all his career , was the star of the World_Series . -- Dennis Byrd walked . Sometimes it ' s a wonderful life .</TEXT>
