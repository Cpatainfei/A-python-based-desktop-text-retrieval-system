   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; DAHLIN GIVES SWEDEN HEADY PERFORMANCE ; GROUP_B : STRIKER LEFT OFF 1990 CUP TEAM HEADS IN TWO GOALS IN 3-1 VICTORY OVER TUMULTUOUS RUSSIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Adding_to its laundry list of 1994 World Cup nightmares , Russia now can be haunted by the elusive Martin Dahlin . Dahlin , the brilliant Swedish striker , kept popping his head into Russia ' s front_door Friday night , scoring on two second-half headers and setting_up another goal in Sweden ' s 3-1 victory before 71 # 528 at Pontiac Silverdome . It was Sweden ' s first World Cup triumph in 20 years . Dahlin , the first black member of the national team , is more_than making_up for a career slump that cost him a place on the 1990 World Cup team . &quot; This was one of his best games , if not his best , &quot; Sweden Coach Tommy Svensson said . Svensson can only hope the victory was enough to propel his team into the second round , because Sweden must face Brazil next Tuesday without Dahlin , who picked_up his second yellow card of the tournament and must sit_out the team ' s final Group_B game . Difficult to imagine Sweden challenging Brazil without Dahlin . &quot; Of course it ' s a loss , &quot; said forward Tomas Brolin , who tied the score on a first-half penalty kick . &quot; But we have other players also . I think we are also in the second round. &quot; Dhalin scored the decisive goal in the 60th minute . The game had turned_in the 49th minute when Russian forward Sergei Gorlukovitch received a red-card ejection for taking Dahlin down from behind . The Russians , gasping to stay in the game at that point , could not endure having to play a man short . Sweden soon forced the issue when midfielder Jonas Thern , uncovered in the left corner , left-footed a pass that hooked into an oncoming Dahlin , who flicked a header to the right of goalkeeper Dmitri Kharine . Dahlin made_it 3-1 in the 82nd minute , this time heading in an extraordinary crossing pass , right to left , from forward Kennet Andersson . As do many humble stars , Dahlin downplayed his role . &quot; I got two great crosses from Thern and Andersson , &quot; Dahlin said . &quot; For me , it was only with my head . It was not so difficult. &quot; The Russians would beg to differ . &quot; Nobody on our defense could handle Dahlin , &quot; Yuri Semin , a Russian assistant coach , said . Rocked by dissension and turmoil , the Russians actually put a scare into Sweden , scoring the first goal in the fourth minute on Oleg Salenko ' s penalty kick . The score was set_up when Sweden ' s Roger Ljung tripped Alexander Borodiuk , who appeared poised to score in front of the Swedish goal . In a questionable strategy by Coach Pavel Sadyrin , Russia tried to sit on the lead , drawing whistles of derision from the crowd . In fact , in the 34th minute , Kharine received a yellow card for delaying play . Sadyrin , who has withstood mass defections and criticisms , also chose not to play Sergei Yuran , presumably one of Russia ' s top strikers . It might have been one of Sadyrin ' s last decisions involving the team ; sources told the Associated Press_on Friday that Sadyrin would resign as Russia ' s coach , or be replaced . Sadyrin did not face the media afterward , but his assistant said Yuran did not play because he had played poorly against Brazil . The Russian result seemed inevitable . Sweden tied the score , 1-1 , in the 39th minute on Brolin ' s penalty kick , set_up by -- who else ? -- Dahlin . After taking a sideline pass , Andersson , his back to the goal near the right corner , bounced the ball off his knee and then kicked it back over his head toward the goal , where Gorlukovitch was backing into Dahlin , who had position on the Russian . A penalty was called and Brolin easily drove his shot to the right of Kharine . Though it was tough for a while , the Swedes said they never felt threatened . &quot; I felt all_the game we were the better team , &quot; Dahlin said . &quot; It ' s not always good to score the first goal . We saw that against Cameroon. &quot; The Russians played their best defense in the locker_room , complaining about the red-card ejection that changed the game . &quot; Of course it hurt us , &quot; Semin said . &quot; I mean you ' re playing with only nine field players. &quot; With one game left in Group_B , Sweden trails Brazil by two points , six to four . Obviously , Tuesday ' s showdown won ' t be the same without Dahlin . &quot; I hope it doesn ' t matter , &quot; he said . &quot; I hope this enough to get_into the second round. &quot;</TEXT>
