   <HEADLINE> TEACH VALUES WITHOUT RELIGIOUS TONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I am responding to a letter from Peter R . Wilkinson ( Dec . 26 ) .I want to congratulate Wilkinson for his advocacy of teaching values in the public_schools . I am concerned that in teaching values , words might be used that resonate a religious tone and bring dogma into the picture where it does not belong . I hope that the teacher will emphasize that good values are not the exclusive domain of the religions and are not related to any rituals , legends , myths , traditions , vestments , visions , protocols , superstitions , prayers or fears of hell ' s fire and damnation . A practical value system adopted and used by all citizens can and should function entirely independent of any religious teachings . PATRICIA SHIRLEY Newport Beach</TEXT>
