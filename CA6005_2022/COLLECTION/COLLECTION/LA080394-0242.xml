   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; SECOND INTERIM WARDEN NAMED FOR LANCASTER STATE_PRISON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A second interim warden has been named to oversee the new state_prison in Lancaster while corrections officials wait for Gov . Pete Wilson to make a permanent appointment . Donald R . Hill , 51 , warden of the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi , moved to the Lancaster prison on Monday , prison spokeswoman Lynn Harrison said.He will also continue to serve as warden at the Tehachapi prison , although an assistant will oversee day-to-day operations at that facility . Hill succeeds John Ratelle , who was appointed interim warden in late February . While at Lancaster , Ratelle also was serving as warden for a state_prison in San Diego , commuting back to that city each weekend to be with his family . Ratelle originally was told he would be at Lancaster only for one to three months , and after five months of commuting he asked to be relieved , Harrison said . The Lancaster detention center , officially called California State_Prison -- Los Angeles County , opened in February , 1993 , under Warden Otis Thurman . During the prison ' s first year , two minimum-security and two maximum-security inmates escaped . Although all_of the prisoners were recaptured , the escapes are believed to have been a key reason that state officials removed Thurman from his post this past February . During Ratelle ' s tenure , he tightened security at the prison and disciplined correctional officers who were_on duty during one of the maximum-security escapes . No escapes occurred during Ratelle ' s watch . The new interim warden , Hill , wants to maintain a low profile , Harrison said , because the governor is said to be close to appointing another permanent administrator for the Lancaster prison , which houses more_than 3 # 000 inmates . When that appointment is made , Hill will return to the Tehachapi prison , she said .</TEXT>
