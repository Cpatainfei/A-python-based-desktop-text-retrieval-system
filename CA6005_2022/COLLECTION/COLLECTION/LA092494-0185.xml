   <HEADLINE> IRATE JUDGE THREATENS TO BAR TV IN SIMPSON CASE ; COURTS : ITO AGAIN DENOUNCES KNBC REPORTS . AS EVIDENCE HEARINGS CONTINUE , SEIZURE OF BRONCO IS RULED LEGAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito , infuriated by what he called a local television_station ' s inaccurate and irresponsible reporting on the O.J. Simpson case , threatened Friday to bar the station from the courthouse and said he may shut_down television coverage of the proceedings altogether . Ito ' s comments marked the second day in a row that he has angrily denounced reports stating that a pair of socks retrieved from Simpson ' s bedroom had been sent to a Maryland laboratory and subjected_to DNA tests , and that those test results pointed to Nicole Brown Simpson as the source of blood on the socks . Sources have told The Times that the report , aired by KNBC-TV , was incorrect and that no DNA test results have been returned on the socks . The flap over press coverage came amid a hearing on evidence in which both sides made gains . Ito ruled that a handwritten note from Nicole Simpson to her ex-husband should not be suppressed , but also found that police exceeded the scope of a warrant when they searched Simpson ' s home June 28 . Because of that , he suppressed several other items seized that day , including a communication between Simpson and his business lawyer about Simpson ' s divorce . With seven search_warrants in_dispute , Ito was unable to complete the arguments about evidence Friday , but said he expects to take_up the_matter again next week . Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday , which will mark the official opening of the trial . It comes just over three months after Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were found slashed to death in front of her Brentwood townhouse . O.J. Simpson was charged with both murders , but has pleaded not_guilty . The case has attracted enormous publicity , and Ito has struggled to curtail some aspects of the public discussion regarding the case . Although he has complained about some reports in the past , this week ' s dispute was by far the most serious and marked the first time he has accused a mainstream news organization of making a factual error . Joined by attorneys for both sides , Ito first disputed the KNBC reports about new DNA evidence during Thursday ' s hearing . But KNBC amplified its story that night , prompting Ito to attack the station and its reporter , Tracie Savage , at the opening of Friday ' s session . &quot; I ' m very concerned because this news operation was put_on notice yesterday that this was incorrect information , &quot; Ito said . &quot; They have chosen not only to republish it but to embellish upon it . This is fundamentally unfair . It ' s also fundamentally wrong. &quot; Seeking to put the reports to rest , Ito questioned Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark about the stories , specifically about KNBC ' s contention that two different DNA tests have been performed on the socks and that they both pointed to Nicole Simpson as the source of the blood . One of those tests is known as a PCR test , while the other , more definitive analysis is called an RFLP test . &quot; KNBC news reporter Savage has reported erroneously that the sock has been submitted to a DNA lab for DNA testing , &quot; Ito said . &quot; Is that ( report ) correct , Miss Clark . . . ? &quot; &quot; That is incorrect , &quot; Clark said . &quot; They also report incorrectly that two tests have been conducted , that PCR and RFLP tests have been conducted and that results have been returned , &quot; Ito continued . &quot; That is also incorrect ? &quot; &quot; That is also incorrect , &quot; Clark responded . On Thursday , KNBC stood firmly behind its story . But in a release Friday , the station ' s management was more circumspect . &quot; We will be responding directly to Judge Ito regarding the issues that he raised in court today , &quot; the statement said . &quot; We share Judge Ito ' s concern that the facts of this case be reported accurately , and we have reported accurately the information our sources have told us , just as we have reported accurately what happened in court today. &quot; In response to the KNBC reports , Ito said he would convene a hearing next week to consider cutting_off the station ' s access to the Criminal_Courts Building and to evaluate whether TV coverage of the case should continue at all . Prosecutors and defense_attorneys said they would accept whatever solution Ito proposed , but news organizations previously have fought for access to hearings in the case and are expected to contest this proposal as well . Legal experts warned that while Ito ' s anger is understandable , the judge may have little ability to strike back at KNBC . Any broader proposal to pull the plug on the televised coverage would certainly draw a vehement protest not only from television_stations but from newspapers and magazines . Because seating in Ito ' s courtroom is limited , many news organizations have been relying_on the television coverage to prepare their reports on the case . &quot; The problem for Judge Ito is that to pull the plug on the television would be to deny the public access to the most accurate information about the Simpson case , &quot; said Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor . The dispute also prompted defense_attorneys to accuse the Los Angeles Police_Department of conducting an organized attempt to deny Simpson a fair trial . They asked Ito to forward the_matter to the state_attorney general for investigation , or at least to seek an LAPD Internal Affairs probe into the source of some leaks . Clark , whose office previously has blamed the LAPD for leaks , endorsed defense_attorney Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. ' s suggestion that an Internal Affairs investigation be launched . At the Police_Department , officials privately fumed at the suggestion that they were to blame , but released a statement late Friday saying that an internal investigation already is under way and that procedures are in place to prevent leaks -- including a requirement that test results be transmitted directly from the laboratories to Judge Ito . &quot; On Sept . 22 , 1994 , the department initiated an Internal Affairs Division investigation to determine if there is a possibility that information may have been inappropriately released by any member of the department to the media , &quot; the statement said . &quot; As in all confidential personnel matters , the department cannot address any aspect of its internal investigation. &quot; The LAPD also called_on prosecutors and defense_attorneys to &quot; join in this effort by discussing ( it ) with their personnel who are involved in any manner in this investigation. &quot; This is not the first time that Simpson ' s lawyers have sought to stem the information being released about the case . In the weeks before and after Simpson ' s arrest , numerous news_reports contained details about the case , frustrating defense_attorneys who complained that potential jurors should not be exposed to that information . Simpson ' s lawyers blamed the district_attorney ' s office and the Police_Department for disseminating the information in those reports , many of which first appeared in The Times . But the latest dispute had added new intensity to the issue because of the contention that the KNBC reports were inaccurate and highly inflammatory -- especially coming so close to the beginning of the trial . &quot; Let ' s not even dignify it as a news leak , &quot; Ito said of the KNBC report . &quot; It ' s a fabrication. &quot; As the hearing Friday continued , Ito ruled that a search of Simpson ' s home was reasonable and that a note from Nicole Simpson to her ex-husband was properly seized . That note , whose existence had previously been unknown either to prosecutors or defense_attorneys , was read in court for the first time Thursday . Written in Nicole Simpson ' s handwriting and attached_to family videotapes , the note states : &quot; O.J. , I understand that this is probably too late , but I have to do_it for myself and the kids , or I would never forgive myself . I ' ll call Cathy from now on , and will only call_in an absolute emergency . Please believe me and return these calls immediately. &quot; A police_detective said he seized that note because he believed it suggested that Nicole Simpson was ending her relationship with her ex-husband , and thus possibly offered a motive for the killings . But Simpson ' s attorneys read the note differently , saying that Nicole Simpson was attempting to keep contact with her ex-husband even after their breakup . That belies the theory that she was being stalked , said Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys . In addition to the note , Ito ' s ruling cleared the way for prosecutors to introduce a tape of a television pilot titled &quot; Frogmen. &quot; That show features Simpson , who at one point holds a knife to a young_woman ' s throat . Police have said that Simpson received special knife training from the Navy SEALS_in preparation for that film , and they seized the tape believing that it would help demonstrate how Simpson could have committed the murders . Even though Ito ruled against the defense ' s efforts to strike those items , he agreed that a_few others were taken illegally . He ordered those items , which include a communication between Simpson and his business lawyer about his divorce from Nicole Simpson , suppressed . Ito also found that a note pad containing names and phone_numbers should not be admitted into evidence , and he similarly ruled_out the use of a videotape featuring highlights from Simpson ' s storied football career . That defense victory was quickly overshadowed , however , when Ito ruled against a defense attempt to contest the seizure of Simpson ' s Ford Bronco . The Bronco was parked outside Simpson ' s home when police arrived a_few hours after the killings . One of the detectives said he spotted a small bloodstain near the door handle , and it was that stain that officers said was largely responsible_for them deciding to jump the wall and enter Simpson ' s estate without a warrant . When they returned later with a warrant authorizing a search of the car and home , they seized the Bronco and subsequently tested it for blood . They also seized a number of items from inside the vehicle , including receipts , notes and equipment . Simpson ' s lawyers argued that the material should not be admitted as evidence . The initial warrant was incorrectly drafted , said Gerald F . Uelmen , one of Simpson ' s attorneys . Uelmen added that drafting mistakes cannot be taken lightly because the 4th Amendment requires that warrants be issued only upon a showing of probable_cause and &quot; particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized. &quot; In the affidavit for a warrant to search Simpson ' s home and car , Detective Philip L . Vannatter described the Bronco as being parked &quot; at the west_side of the residence headed north on Rockingham Avenue. &quot; Uelmen said that was incorrect , since it did not make clear that the car was_on a public street but rather implied that it was_on Simpson ' s property . Clark responded by calling that &quot; hair splitting &quot; and by reminding Ito that Vannatter had been up all night when he drafted the affidavit . When Ito said Vannatter was an expert with long experience in criminal investigations who should know better than to make drafting errors , Clark answered : &quot; He ' s also a human_being , your honor. &quot; After reviewing the affidavit and other court cases regarding warrants , Ito concluded that the statement about the Bronco ' s location was not enough to justify suppressing the warrant . Though the defense did not prevail in that search_warrant dispute , legal_experts said Simpson ' s lawyers have effectively used the issue to bolster their claims of investigative incompetence and malfeasance . Already , Ito has found that Vannatter recklessly disregarded the truth in preparing one warrant , and Friday ' s rulings show that he believes other officers exceeded the bounds of a second one . He deferred a decision about other specific items taken from the Bronco , however , promising to return to that topic on Wednesday . Both sides are next expected in court Monday morning , when the grueling task of picking a fair and impartial jury will begin . One thousand prospective jurors have been summoned , but about 700 already have indicated that they would have difficulty serving on a trial that could last as long as six months .</TEXT>
