   <HEADLINE> FOOD_STAMPS DENIED IN FRAUD CRACKDOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of an effort to crack_down on fraudulent claims , federal_officials said Wednesday they have denied 4 # 334 applications for emergency food_stamps by residents in the Los Angeles area during the last week . Crowds of more_than 1 # 000 earthquake victims continued this week to line_up at Dodger Stadium and three other large processing centers to obtain coupons that can be redeemed for food at grocery_stores , Department_of_Agriculture officials said . Last weekend , authorities arrested five people on charges of buying and reselling food_stamps outside a South-Central Los Angeles check-cashing store . More arrests are expected as a task_force of 29 undercover investigators fans_out across Southern California streets in search of fraudulent transactions . &quot; I think when you have so many hundreds of thousands of people who have stood on lines and are so desperate , we are going_to have many of those desperate people acting_out street crimes the same way they would in any instance , &quot; said Ellen Haas , assistant secretary for food and consumer services . Haas testified Wednesday , at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing on fraud and abuse in nutrition assistance programs , that illegal food_stamp trafficking exceeded $ 1 billion last year . In some cases , she said , coupons were exchanged for guns and drugs . The federal_government began distributing emergency food_stamps Jan . 24 . So far , 117 # 419 earthquake victims have received $ 35.7 million in vouchers , in addition to the more_than $ 60 million in food_stamps issued each month in Los Angeles County . The daily number of rejected applications has increased from 30 on Jan . 24 to 1 # 212 Tuesday as federal_officials employed various tactics to crack_down on fraud in Los Angeles . These include warning applicants through flyers and loudspeaker announcements that food_stamp fraud is punishable by fines up_to $ 250 # 000 , reducing the number of application sites from 29 to 16 and instituting a three-day waiting period before providing benefits . &quot; We are doing so_much aggressively to prevent ( fraud ) , &quot; Haas said . &quot; A lot of fraud isn ' t just street trafficking ; a lot of people are double-dipping. &quot; Once applications are received , inspectors use a state computer_system to check for repeat applications and use information from various sources to verify statements . Nationwide , food_stamp fraud often takes_place at some of the 207 # 000 retail_stores authorized to accept the vouchers . Last year , Department_of_Agriculture officials reported finding violations in 2 # 147 stores . In Illinois , authorities indicted 19 individuals and 12 corporations on fraud and money_laundering charges . &quot; The integrity of the food_stamp program is at stake , &quot; Sen . Richard G . Lugar ( R-Ind. ) told Agriculture_Department officials at Wednesday ' s hearing . &quot; The amount of press attention emphasizing fraud is devastating. &quot;</TEXT>
