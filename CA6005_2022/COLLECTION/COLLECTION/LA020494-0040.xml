   <HEADLINE> ON THE FEMININE SIDE ; NANCY MACKO ' S MULTIMEDIA SHOW BRINGS TOGETHER IMAGES OF GODDESSES AND HONEYBEES . IT BLENDS FEMALE SPIRITUALITY WITH THE POTENCY OF NATURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Brand Library Art_Galleries agreed to give Nancy Macko a solo show about three years ago , she decided she would do something different . Rather than attempt to fill the large main gallery with her two-dimensional prints and collages that garnered her a spot on Brand ' s schedule , the professor of art and director of the computer art program at Scripps College &quot; started thinking_about getting_off the wall , of doing an installation . It seemed so freeing and involving , &quot; she said . Macko asked herself , &quot; If I could do what I really wanted to do , what would it be ? &quot; Her answer was to create an ancient matriarchal temple within a modern context . Integrating her artistic skills with some research on women of the Bible , pre-biblical goddesses and honeybee society , she has abundantly fulfilled that goal in the &quot; Dance of the Melissae. &quot; Melissae is the plural of Melissa , the Greek word for bee . In Macko ' s multimedia installation , her handmade and computer-generated artwork brings_together images of the honeybee society -- including queen_bees , bee priestesses , the natural hexagonal form of the honeycomb and the molecular structure of glucose -- with abstractions of mythological goddesses . &quot; For Macko , the goddess symbolizes a female-centered spirituality and the bee society represents the feminine potency of nature , &quot; writes Mary Davis MacNaughton , director of Scripps College ' s Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery . &quot; Her temple-like space refers to an ancient polytheistic world before male gods overthrew female goddesses , when nature and spirituality were joined . Her honeycomb is a metaphor of connection ; it reminds us that we are part of nature , and not its master . &quot; Macko ' s work also suggests that science and art are linked though human imagination , for science , like art , not only observes the world but re-envisions it. &quot; The exhibit consists_of eight sections . On one end of the gallery is the &quot; Honeycomb Wall &quot; of 100 wood panels containing objects related to honeybees , references_to the geometry and chemistry of honey as well as printed images from linoleum blocks and Cibachrome prints of computer-generated images . Some of the panels have been treated with beeswax . Among the images are text statements such_as &quot; Pythagoreans worshiped bees as sacred creatures of Aphrodite &quot; and &quot; Honey was a symbol of resurrection. &quot; At the center , beneath the skylight , is &quot; Aphrodite ' s Lattice , &quot; a 12-by-12-foot hexagonal floor piece made of wax and lead . At its center is an elongated vase filled with honeycombs and computer chips . At the other end of the gallery stands the &quot; Stations of the Goddess , &quot; 11 thought-provoking displays made of various objects and perched on pedestals . Although they make reference_to the Stations of the Cross , &quot; they are not about guilt and forgiveness , &quot; Macko said . &quot; They ' re about life. &quot; Sly humor beams from such stations as &quot; Fertility / Fecundity , &quot; in which round plastic-like beads mingle with similarly shaped contraceptive_devices . In &quot; Nurturance , &quot; plastic baby bottles are filled with honey , but sport well known soda_pop names . &quot; daughters &quot; contains Macko ' s first pair of dress shoes and a photograph of her at age 3 wearing them . They rest_on a mirror that reveals , in words , her own sexual awareness . Next to the stations is the &quot; Vestments of a Bee Priestess , &quot; including a coral silk cocktail_dress that belonged_to her grandmother and a traditional beekeeper ' s helmet . One can see pictures of Macko in the outfit on the &quot; Honeycomb Wall. &quot; Macko has also adapted to the gallery walls ancient cave drawings that recall early honey hunters and gatherers . Her fascination with honey comes from , among other things , the fact that it &quot; has been around since the beginning of time , that it was the only sweetener and that the first alcohol came from honey . It was integrated with sexuality and sensuousness , &quot; she said . Enhancing her sensuous visual environment are the sounds of a cappella tap_dancing , the humming of bees , chants of Tibetan nuns and other rhythmic sounds , which emanate from a continuous audio track . The smells of beeswax , coriander and lavender also permeate the gallery . Macko said she is &quot; offering an alternative vision &quot; to the societal structure that has governed our lives since at least biblical times , but &quot; it doesn ' t have to be set_in stone. &quot; Her creation is just that : a personal rather than doctrinaire view of anything past or present . Also in the gallery are pastels by Nancy Popenoe . Among them are several evocative , almost surrealistic night scenes of Los Angeles area bungalows , corner cafes , liquor_stores and familiar dives . The hot light_within these energetic scenes draws one into the pictures , making one wonder what is going_on inside .
