   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEW ; SALONEN LEADS BRUCKNER ' S THIRD SYMPHONY AT BOWL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Esa-Pekka Salonen closed his four-program Hollywood Bowl visit this summer the same way he closed his portion of the Los Angeles Philharmonic ' s spring season in May -- with a two-work program offering elegant brevity in the first_half , followed by an early intermission and the swollen rhetoric of Anton Bruckner ' s Third Symphony in the post-interval . Thursday night , Salonen ' s willing Philharmonic colleagues again covered themselves with glory in a pristine , handsomely contoured , practically transparent performance of the D-minor Symphony . The immaculate nature of the playing , of course , only underscored , for the unconverted , the paucity of the Austrian composer ' s inspiration . Still , faced with this genuinely admirable achievement , one could understand again why Bruckner ' s humorless , endlessly self-conscious symphonic essays attract conductors and listeners : They drip with aspiration and sincerity and the longing for spirituality . Salonen &amp; Co. , who take this work_on their 11-city European tour next week , have polished their rather unsmiling performance to a shine , finding the quiet places and savoring them with all_the naturalness they lavish upon the large and numerous climaxes . For some listeners , these wondrous contrasts are only more proof that the Third Symphony is mostly air ; for others , such readings confirm the sublimity of the composer ' s text . Chacun a son gout . In the short first_half of this concert -- heard by a reported audience of 9 # 834 -- Olli Mustonen , Salonen ' s 27-year-old Finnish countryman , became the accomplished soloist in Maurice Ravel ' s universally beloved Piano Concerto in G . Mustonen sought and found striking articulation and easy fluency in the familiar work -- his technique is abundant and reliable . Even so , this proved no definitive performance . With all_the overstressing of melodies and brilliant , brittle playing , both pianistic and orchestral , the many subtleties of the work evaporated in the night air . Mustonen / Salonen got its rhythmicality and much of its jazziness , but little of its insouciance . There is magic here , but it emerges only from an aura of understatement and indirection . In all , this was as un-Gallic a reading as one might imagine .</TEXT>
