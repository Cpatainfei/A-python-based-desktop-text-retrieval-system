   <HEADLINE> BACK ON TRACK ; CAL STATE L.A. SPRINTER BARRY SMITH IS IN TOP FORM AGAIN AFTER A LONG FIGHT WITH HODGKIN ' S DISEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The odds were against Barry Smith before he entered the starting_blocks for the 200 meters in the 1990 State junior_college finals . The East Los Angeles College freshman finished third but was convinced he would have won if not for a tactical mistake . &quot; I was mad because I should have come_off the turn stronger , &quot; Smith said . No doubt he had the ability . But he also had Hodgkin ' s disease . Three weeks after the finals Smith took_on the most grueling challenge of his life . He underwent one operation to have a tumor removed from his neck and another to have his spleen removed . He went_for radiation treatment five days a week -- 137 sessions from July through December . The first sessions focused_on his head and neck , and then as the months wore_on , his chest and stomach . &quot; I was throwing_up every five minutes because of the radiation , but I never missed a treatment , &quot; said Smith , 23 . &quot; I hated it . I was marking the days_off the calendar until I would be a free man . You lose your sense_of_smell and sense_of_taste and everything tastes like dirt. &quot; Smith , who finished therapy two days before Christmas , 1990 , will have checkups every six months for the rest of his life . But all signs indicate he is in_remission . About 70 % to 80 % of Hodgkin ' s disease patients survive for at least five years after treatment . If the condition is treated successfully at an early stage , like Smith ' s , the disease is apparently cured . Smith said the radiation treatments sent tingling sensations throughout his body for more_than a year , but they are gone . The only visible signs are scars on his neck and abdomen from incisions . &quot; I don ' t feel bitter for what happened , &quot; Smith said . &quot; Everything happens for a reason . I guess God wanted to see how strong I was . I learned what life is all about and to take every step with each breath. &quot; Smith ' s first warning came during an athletics physical at East L.A. College in March , 1990 . He was cleared to compete in track but was referred to a nose , throat and ear_specialist because of a lump on his neck . Smith saw several other physicians before the diagnosis was made more_than two months later . Smith continued to compete , trying to keep his illness a secret from his coaches and teammates . But by the time the State meet rolled_around , a growth the size of a golf_ball had developed in the left side of his neck . * &quot; I didn ' t practice at all because I was always at the doctor taking tests , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I knew the State meet was my last race of the season and I wasn ' t going_to compete for a long_time . I never worried about dying . The only thing I stressed out about was when I would be back on the track. &quot; It would be many months and many ordeals later . Transportation for treatment in Long_Beach posed a problem for Smith , who lives_in Monterey Park . The effects of the radiation made him too ill to drive . He took the bus until drivers refused to let him on because of his constant vomiting . The American Cancer Society eventually provided Smith with taxi vouchers . The 5-foot-9 former State high_school champion lost his hair and watched his weight drop from 165 pounds to 114 . Smith ' s parents , Uera and Thelma , repeatedly asked him to return home to San Francisco while he was undergoing treatment . &quot; My mom cried when I told her I had cancer , but I told her I could get_through it alone , &quot; said Smith , the second-youngest of 10 children . &quot; My parents can ' t live with me forever , and I didn ' t want to burden my mom to see me the way I was. &quot; * Hodgkin ' s disease is a cancer that attacks the lymph_nodes and other lymph tissues . Three new cases per 100 # 000 people are diagnosed in the United States each year . The disease is more common in men and usually strikes people in their 20s and those between 55 and 77 . Smith ' s Hodgkin ' s disease was classified as &quot; A-1 , &quot; the least dangerous form . The cause of Hodgkin ' s disease is unknown . Smith ' s grandmother died of cancer and he speculates the cause may have been hereditary . &quot; I was saying my prayers , &quot; Smith said . &quot; If I died , I thought at least I accomplished something getting_out of the ghettos in San Francisco and going_to college. &quot; A physical_education major , Smith did not return to school full time until last year at Long_Beach City College . Doctors told Smith he would be able to return to competition in a year . But it turned_out to be two . And it was open for debate whether Smith could return to the form of his senior season at San Francisco Mission High , where he won the 200 in the 1989 State meet and ran a meet record in the 100 meters in the preliminaries . &quot; I ran in all-comer meets and didn ' t do too well , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I was so happy just to run ; I could have been last and not been disappointed. &quot; Smith surpassed those expectations last year . * He ran a personal best in the 200 of 20.63 seconds and advanced to the semifinals in the event in last June ' s USA Track_and_Field national championships in Eugene , Ore. , competing in a heat that included Carl Lewis , 1992 Olympic champion Mike Marsh and former 100 world record-holder Leroy Burrell . Smith also ran 10.37 in the 100 last year , just . 03 seconds off his best . In the State junior_college championship , Smith finished second in the 100 and the 200 and ran_on Long_Beach City ' s victorious 400-meter relay team to help the Vikings to the state title . Smith trained occasionally over the last two years at Cal State L.A. but did not take_up Coach Kevin McCarthy ' s offer to compete for the Golden Eagles until last month . &quot; I would see him working_out and told him he would be always welcome if he needed a school to go_to , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; I left an open_door for him and he accepted. &quot; With the addition of Smith , McCarthy is optimistic about the Golden Eagles ' chances for knocking_off four-time defending champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn . championships in May . &quot; If Barry does_well at ( the NCAA Division II ) nationals , we ' ll do_well at nationals , especially the relays , &quot; said McCarthy , who is hoping for a top-five national finish . Such optimism was evident April 17 at the Mt . San Antonio College Relays . Smith anchored the Golden Eagles ' 400 relay team to a mark of 40.52 -- the second-fastest college time in the state this season . &quot; Last year showed me I could run in the low 10s and 20s if I was healthy , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I want to do_well at nationals . I feel I can run with anybody when I get_in shape . &quot; When you ' ve beaten what I ' ve beaten , it ' s hard not to think that way. &quot;</TEXT>
