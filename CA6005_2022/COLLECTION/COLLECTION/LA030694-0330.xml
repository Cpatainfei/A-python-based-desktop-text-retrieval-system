   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : HE ' S JUST PETE -- BUT that ' s PLENTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans like Pete Sampras for the same reasons they used to like Dempsey , Ruth , Red Grange , Walter Johnson , Joe Louis , John Wayne -- or even John Daly . They adore raw power . They revere the guy with the knockout_punch , the home_run swat , the explosive touchdown run , the 100-m.p.h. fastball . The quick draw_in the western . Dirty Harry . The guy with the equalizer . They like to think they ' re for the underdog . But underdogs don ' t sell tickets . They flock to see the guys named &quot; Sultan_of_Swat , &quot; &quot; Brown Bomber , &quot; &quot; Galloping Ghost , &quot; &quot; Big Train. &quot; Guys nicknamed &quot; Rabbit &quot; don ' t get_it , don ' t fill seats . They get cult followings , not sellouts . &quot; Charlie Hustle &quot; is OK , but &quot; Iron_Horse &quot; makes you reach for the wallet . We have to get a nickname for Pete Sampras . &quot; Pistol Pete ? &quot; Nah . Too trite . Besides , a 129-m.p.h. serve is not a pistol , it ' s a railroad gun . Big Bill ( note the &quot; Big &quot; ) Tilden ' s serve like that was called &quot; cannonball. &quot; We don ' t like sending_out a representative known as &quot; Bunny &quot; or &quot; Bitsy. &quot; We like &quot; Rocky. &quot; We want to play the Borises and Ivans and Stefans of the world with someone whose nom de games strikes terror . But it ' s getting risky fastening a colorful nickname on a player in sport today . It can blow_up in your face . The Ivans can all turn terrible , the cannonballs can become soap_bubbles . It ' s getting so that John Wayne is getting killed in the third reel . Take tennis . It used to be the most formful of all sports . It was a monarchy . &quot; Unknown Wins Open &quot; was not even in the lexicography of the sport . Tennis was like the House_of_Tudor , a succession of kings . The crown was passed down . There was Tilden . Then there was Don Budge , followed by Jack Kramer , Lew Hoad , and then the great Laver , Connors and Borg . It was an aristocracy . Golf was a crapshoot by comparison . But , today , it has become a lottery . Look_at the Newsweek Champions Cup at the Hyatt Grand Champions resort here this week . Fourteen of the 18 top players in the world began this tournament . They were expected to run the ribbon clerks -- the unseeded -- out by nightfall Thursday . Instead , the ribbon clerks began raking_in all_the pots . By week ' s end , they had run_out of the game 1 ) Jim Courier , seeded second here and ranked No . 3 in the world ; 2 ) Andre Agassi , winner of Wimbledon and 19 other world titles ; 3 ) Sergi Bruguera , reigning French Open champion and No . 5 in the world ; 4 ) Goran Ivanisevic , the Croatian crusher , Wimbledon finalist and a ball-basher who had 957 aces to his credit last year ; 5 ) Michael Chang , French Open champion and winner of this tournament two years ago , seeded No . 6 here and ranked No . 8 in the world ; 6 ) Cedric Pioline , who reached the final in last year ' s U.S. Open , the first Frenchman in 64 years to do that ; 7 ) Marc Rosset , winner of the gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics and No . 16 in the world . And who had been left standing while all that carnage was being toted_up ? Well , there was one guy who was ranked No . 1 # 013 in the world , one guy who was 99th and another who was 49th . Guess who restored order ? Well , it was our own tennis version of Clint Eastwood . The guy with the . 357 Magnum . Pete Sampras . Wyatt Earp on a white_horse . The marshal . Pete put the ribbon clerks on the noon stage out of town -- with a little help from Stefan Edberg . Just when it looked_like the weekend would be for no-names only , Sampras and Edberg blasted into a semifinal pairing . A pity it was a semifinal , because this was a matchup worthy of Wimbledon . This was no semi-windup . This was Dempsey-Tunney . Sampras is coming_off a season in which he has won Wimbledon , the U.S. Open and the Australian Open in a row . And Edberg has won two Wimbledons , two U.S. Opens and two Australian Opens . There is no trouble finding a nickname for Master Edberg . This is tennis ' &quot; Mr. Smooth. &quot; Edberg ' s nom de courts should be &quot; the Mechanic. &quot; He plays tennis like the guy who came_to fix the plumbing . He takes_stock of the problem , drops his toolbox , ambles over to see exactly what it ' s going_to take , then he proceeds methodically to find the leak in your game . He ' s as unemotional as a border guard . He doesn ' t play tennis , he performs it . Like surgery . He ' s as patient as Mother Teresa . Playing Sampras in a three-set match is like fighting a bobcat in a closet . You don ' t have too_much time to figure_out strategy . It ' s tough playing a guy when your best hope is that he will miss . It ' s like hoping the alligator doesn ' t see you . &quot; It takes you a set just to get used to the pace of that ball coming at you , &quot; Edberg admitted after losing to Sampras Saturday , 6-3 , 3-6 . 6-4 . &quot; By the time you get ready to hit it , it ' s too late. &quot; Sampras is No . 1 in the world because he ' s going_in the game , so to speak , with a 54-card deck . That serve of his is worth 10 points a set . Those are points you more or less have to spot him . After all , he was the first guy in the game to have more_than 1 # 000 aces ( 1 # 011 ) last year . You might be able to see his ball better in daylight , but the ball goes faster in light dry air . In other words , in a monsoon or under water , you might stand a chance . At sea_level , forget it . He served 15-to-20 m.p.h. faster than Edberg all afternoon Saturday in what could have been a preview of this year ' s Grand_Slam finals . His balls came_in at nuclear velocities -- 128 , 122 , 124 m.p.h. against Stefan ' s top of 110 and usual 100 . Edberg needs only one breakthrough a set to win and he got_it in the second set , 6-3 , Saturday but , by the end of the third set , he looked_like a guy caught in a rockslide . You can see why Sampras needs a nickname . It has been a while since we had a Yank at court whose ball moves so fast it tends to disappear like a Koufax fastball on the way to the plate . We always find a sobriquet to fit our top guns . We haven ' t had one in tennis in this country in a while , leaning to guys who won with ( ugh ! ) two-handed_backhands . Now we have a guy who wins the old-fashioned way , he knocks you out . When a guy in golf gets this unstoppable , he becomes &quot; the Golden Bear. &quot; In basketball , he becomes &quot; Air Jordan. &quot; The times being what they are , it will probably have to be something like &quot; Laser Pete. &quot; But the rest of tennis probably wishes they would just call him illegal . Or maybe just raise the net when he ' s serving . * TODAY ' S FINAL : Petr Korda , who defeated Pete Sampras in the $ 6-million Grand_Slam Cup in December , challenges the No . 1 seed again in championship match at Indian Wells .
