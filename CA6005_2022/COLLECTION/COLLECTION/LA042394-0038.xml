   <HEADLINE> NO LANGUAGE_BARRIER ; COLLEGE BOARD TO OFFER FIRST TEST OF PROFICIENCY IN CHINESE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; It ' s nice to know that Chinese is finally being accepted , &quot; said Alhambra High_School junior Gary Chen as he prepared to join more_than 3 # 000 students nationwide on Tuesday in tackling the College Board ' s first test to measure proficiency in Mandarin_Chinese . Chen , 16 , a Chinese American , has studied Mandarin at his school for the past three years . He will be among about 250 students from the heavily Asian Alhambra , Mark Keppel and San Gabriel high_schools who will take the Chinese exam . The one-hour Mandarin test is only the second on an Asian language to make the College Board ' s foreign language roster . Until last year , when Japanese was added , only French , Spanish , German , Italian , Latin and modern_Hebrew had been offered . L . Ling-chi Wang , a UC Berkeley professor and chairman of the UC Task_Force on Asian Languages , says acceptance of the Mandarin test by the College Board is long overdue in_view of the dramatic growth of the Asian American population and of U.S. interests with East Asian_countries . The number of students taking Mandarin , the language spoken by a fifth of the world ' s people , increased by more_than 50 % between 1990 and 1993 in California ' s public_schools . Tests are required for students seeking admission to many colleges . Although the University of California and other colleges require applicants to take English and math tests , students can choose their third exam , which can be in a foreign language . The achievement tests -- known as SAT II -- are used in making admission decisions and sometimes to place students in the correct course level . The exclusion of Asian languages was ended in 1993 when the College Board , a consortium of schools and colleges formed in 1901 to offer college entrance exams , chose Japanese . The Japanese test was developed only after years of lobbying by the UC Task_Force on Asian Languages and pressure from the California Legislature , according to Wang . The big question now is whether to develop a test in Korean . People of Korean descent make_up one of California ' s largest Asian population groups after Filipinos , Chinese and Japanese . * College Board President Donald Stewart today will address a statewide conference on Asian languages in Pasadena and later will meet with Asian American scholars and Korean community leaders in Koreatown . &quot; We ' ve invited him to Los Angeles so he can see for himself the size of the Korean American community , &quot; said Edward Chang , a UC Riverside professor and a member of the UC task_force . Wang said there is a dispute over what was promised by the College Board . &quot; We had assumed all along that the agreement in 1991 was for four languages -- Japanese , Chinese , Korean and Vietnamese , &quot; Wang said . But Brian O ' Reilly , the board ' s director of operations and development , said the only thing the College Board agreed to was &quot; to take_on the development of tests in appropriate Asian languages. &quot; O ' Reilly acknowledged , however , that there is considerable interest around the country in including Korean . &quot; We are working hard to come_up with funding &quot; to study the possibility of developing a Korean test , he said , but no timetable has been set . As for Vietnamese , there has not been the same level of interest , he said . O ' Reilly said developing a Korean test would be &quot; a complete departure &quot; from the College Board ' s policy because Korean is taught in only a_few U.S. high_schools . But at a Koreatown news_conference this week , Asian American educators said about 30 # 000 youngsters of Korean ancestry attend more_than 1 # 000 community and church-related schools nationwide after school and on weekends because only four public_schools in the country offer the language . The students should be able to pursue their interests , they said . &quot; Oftentimes the College Board . . . doesn ' t understand the realities of the Asian American community , &quot; Don Nakanishi , director of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center , told the news_conference . &quot; The College Board should get_out of its East Coast perspective , &quot; he added . O ' Reilly called Nakanishi ' s remark unfair . &quot; We have offices in San Jose , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not fair any longer to say that we ' re Eurocentric . We have two tests ( in Asian languages ) . &quot; Alhambra High_School sophomore Jennifer Sun , 16 , who will be taking the Mandarin test , said she is thankful that &quot; a lot of people worked hard &quot; to make_it possible for her to take the test . &quot; This is very exciting , &quot; said Sally Chao , Alhambra High assistant principal . &quot; When I was going_to high_school , I was envious of the kids who spoke Spanish and French and could take the test. &quot;</TEXT>
