   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE RADAR SCANS SAHARA FOR SIGNS OF LOST CIVILIZATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The most advanced radar ever sent into space by NASA peered beneath the sand of the Sahara_Desert on Monday for traces of ancient river channels and lost civilizations . Two days into the 10-day flight , the radar aboard space shuttle Endeavour had mapped about 3 million square_miles of Earth ' s surface , an area equivalent_to half the United States . After some initial difficulty , the $ 366-million worth of radar equipment is providing unprecedented three-dimensional maps of deserts , mountains , oceans , rivers and cropland . Scientists hope these images will help them better understand environmental changes and provide the world ' s policy-makers with ways to preserve Earth . That is the future . There is also the past : Archeologists and historians want to see radar images of the Sahara , Arabian and Chinese deserts . &quot; This area is of particular interest , not only for past climate change . . . but also the archeology aspect is extremely exciting , &quot; said project scientist Diane Evans , a geologist at Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif . Previous radar images and pictures from space led to the discovery in Oman of what is believed to be the lost city of Ubar , called &quot; the Atlantis of the sands &quot; by Lawrence of Arabia . Excavators believe the city was an ancient trading center for frankincense . As Endeavour flew 138 miles over Algeria , the radar scanned the Central Sahara for ancient tributaries of the Niger_River . One of the three radar wavelengths can penetrate as much as 10 feet beneath the surface .</TEXT>
