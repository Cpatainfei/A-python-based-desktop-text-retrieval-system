   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : SCRIPT TO SCREEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Auguste Lumiere and his brother Lois are credited as the first to project a film to a paying audience--on Dec . 28 # 1895 . &quot; It can be exploited for a certain time as a scientific curiosity , but apart from that , it has no commercial value whatsoever , &quot; said Auguste about their combination camera / printer / projector . He obviously underestimated their achievement . Nearly a century later , more_than 300 films a year are produced in California , the average_cost of making a movie is almost $ 30 million , and movie_theater admissions are close to a_billion a year . When the credits roll , the contributions of hundreds may appear for a single film--whether the work was done on a studio backlot in the Valley , on location on a residential street in Van Nuys , or on an editing bench at a Valley post-production house . Job titles and number of personnel vary from film to film , but the process of filmmaking shown below is typical : ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) DEVELOPMENT Contract is negotiated with writer , and the source , such_as a novel , play or original screenplay , is converted into a workable script . PRE-PRODUCTION * Actors cast * Locations scouted * Background researched . * Set is designed and constructed . * Equipment , props , and costumes are rented or purchased * Detailed production budget / shooting schedule worked_up PRODUCTION The production of a movie can involve hundreds of behind-the-scenes personnel , specially trained people who do everything from building and painting sets to &quot; grips &quot; who transport and set_up equipment , props and scenery . Some of those on the scene : Directing Team * Director selects and stages what will be photographed in any given take , indicating where camera will be , deciding which takes should be used . When &quot; blocking &quot; a scene , the director tells a actor where to stand and when and where to move . * Assistant directors keep production running smoothly and on schedule , breaking_down script , arranging background action , managing extras . * Script supervisor keeps track of what is being shot , making_sure continuity is maintained . * Camera Crew Director of photography ( cinematographer ) determines how set will be lit , works with director on how shots will be set_up . * Camera operator operates camera , determining for sound crew where to position boom microphones . * Focus puller maintains camera during shooting , changing lenses and magazines and following focus . * Clapper / loader uses clapper board , loads film into camera , labels film cans and prepares film for shipment to lab . * Sound crew * Sound mixer works with director and cinematographer to decide where microphones should be placed , operates a mixing console into which microphones ' signals are fed and balanced on their way into tape_recorder . * Boom operator handles boom microphone or fits actors with smaller mikes * Cable handler ensures wires are properly run from mike to console or recorder * Electrical Crew Gaffer works with cinematographer to set_up shot , sometimes roughing_out lighting plan beforehand Best boy is second in command and assists gaffer Key grip works partly as a construction manager and back-up to the camera crew POST-PRODUCTION After shooting is completed , special_effects must be added , sound mixed and the film edited . * Special_effects cinematography usually requires a separate crew and special equipment to achieve techniques that provide illusions on screen . Techniques range from the use of miniatures to computerized effects . * Sound mixing combines all individual soundtracks for dialogue , music and sound_effects into a single composite master soundtrack . This is done_in a theater or studio on a special console . * Editing is done on upright or flatbed editing machines , or by using computerized video . Working closely with the director , the editor splices and cements film during the process . Several working prints are made before a final composite print is made . * After editing , master prints are made from the original negative . Duplicate negatives are then made and turned_into release prints , which are distributed for exhibition .
