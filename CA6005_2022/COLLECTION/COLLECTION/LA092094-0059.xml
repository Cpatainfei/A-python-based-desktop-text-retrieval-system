The Social Democratic Party , challenging Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the national level in October , is receiving only 29 % support in polls in Bavaria . The Christian Democrats ' other junior partner , the liberal Free Democratic Party , is receiving in polls nationwide less than the 5 % needed to get_into Parliament , which could indicate problems for Kohl in putting_together a national coalition if his party triumphs .</TEXT>
