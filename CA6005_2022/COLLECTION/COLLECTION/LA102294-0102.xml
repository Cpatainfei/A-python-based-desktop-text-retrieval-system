   <HEADLINE> COLD_WAR SECRECY TIED TO RADIATION PERIL ; ETHICS : CLOSED DEBATE ON GOVERNMENT ' S ATOMIC TESTING DECADES AGO MEANT CONTRACTORS , RESEARCHERS WERE UNAWARE OF HUMAN DANGERS , REPORT SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investigators reviewing the history of government-sponsored atomic experiments concluded Friday that Cold_War secrecy and bureaucratic sprawl created a patchwork of policies that unwittingly exposed many humans to potentially dangerous radiation . In a preliminary report , the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments found that senior government officials extensively debated the need for human experimentation and the policies that should govern it . But because that debate was often secret , many contractors and university researchers apparently were unaware of legal and ethical concerns surrounding the experiments they were paid to conduct . In 1954 , for example , Secretary_of_Defense Charles E . Wilson directed that human radiation experiments conducted by the Defense_Department should follow the strict code of medical ethics that emerged from the post-war Nuremberg trials . But he classified his directive &quot; top secret , &quot; which meant that it could not be shared with many involved in the programs . &quot; that ' s one of the most intriguing and perplexing problems we came_up with , &quot; said Ruth Faden , a medical ethicist from Johns Hopkins University named to lead the 14-member panel . &quot; We are still trying to figure_out why anybody in_his_right_mind would adopt an ethical policy and then classify it secret. &quot; Faden said that her panel , established by Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary last April , has largely documented the existence of some 400 government-sponsored radiation experiments that exposed humans to radiation between 1947 and 1977 . But Faden added that , by the time the huge data-gathering effort is completed , the number of experiments &quot; will probably be in the thousands. &quot; Among those are hundreds of experiments in which Energy_Department contractors intentionally released radiation into the general population to study its effects . That is many times more_than the 13 intentional releases the committee had known about earlier , including one in which radiation released from a planned rocket malfunction drifted over Los Angeles . In spite of appearances , however , committee_members said it was clear that the experiments were not conducted in an ethical vacuum . Faden said there were_active debates , some involving senior officials , university leaders and leading scientists , about what ethical guidelines should govern the experiments . Even when guidelines were drafted in the open and made available widely , they apparently were not always carried_out in the field . In many cases , scientists seemed unsure which government_agency ' s policy governed their research . In other cases , there was confusion over such questions as whether guidelines governing experimentation on normal , healthy adults extended_to those who were in institutions or gravely ill . While the committee found evidence of ethical debates , Faden said , &quot; it would be a mistake to leave the impression . . . that this discussion was a result of ethical soul-searching about whether this was something we ought to be undertaking as a nation. &quot; Much of the debate that took_place in late 1940s and early 1950s &quot; may well have been animated by straightforward legal concerns about liability -- we ' re not sure about that -- but also perhaps about insurance and public relations issues , &quot; Faden said . Secrecy also has hampered efforts to construct a full picture of the government ' s vast apparatus of experimentation . &quot; Significant collections of relevant material are still classified , &quot; the report said . The Energy_Department , which is being pressed by O ' Leary to be more forthcoming on nuclear matters , has said that it must protect much of the documentation on 250 tests in which radioactive lanthanum was intentionally released into the atmosphere by Los Alamos Laboratories in New Mexico . The Defense_Department has similarly refused to declassify information related to a 1949 experiment in which it released radioisotopes into the atmosphere from the Hanford Nuclear Plant in Washington state . Committee_members said that the Central_Intelligence_Agency also has been reluctant to locate and declassify documents about its participation in the planning of government-sponsored human experiments involving radioactivity . Only Faden and six of the committee ' s staff_members have been granted security clearances allowing them to comb through millions of pages of secret documents .</TEXT>
