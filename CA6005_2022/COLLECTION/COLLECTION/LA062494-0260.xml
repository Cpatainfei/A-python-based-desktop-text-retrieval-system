   <HEADLINE> FORECAST FOR ORANGE COUNTY BRIGHT , REPORT SAYS ; ECONOMY : IN SHARP CONTRAST TO L.A. COUNTY , STUDY SEES RAPID GROWTH IN JOBS , RETAIL AND HOME SALES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bolstered by a strong export market for its high-technology and medical products , Orange County ' s economy is growing far more rapidly this year than expected , according to a report released Thursday by Chapman University in Orange . In fact , university economists said , they expect the county to end 1994 well into a recovery from the lingering recession that began in 1990 . Encouraged by revised employment data and higher-than-expected levels of consumer and business spending , Orange County employers will add 10 # 000 jobs to their payrolls this year , predicted James Doti , the university ' s president and chief economic forecaster . He also said taxable retail sales and housing sales -- both strong indicators of consumer confidence -- will show appreciable growth . By contrast , Los Angeles County employers are expected to slash almost 30 # 000 jobs from their payrolls this year , Chapman economist Esmael Adibi said . A key difference between the two regional economies is that Los Angeles County is far more dependent_on aerospace and defense employment , which has plunged in recent years . The construction_industry in Los Angeles County is not likely to enjoy a &quot; mini boom &quot; like the one that seems to be starting in Orange County , according to Adibi . Average home prices in Los Angeles County should decline 3.3 % , for the fourth annual decrease in a row . However , the report also notes that personal_income in Los Angeles County is expected to grow by 3 % in 1994 , while retail sales should also grow slightly , with new-car sales leading the way . The Chapman Center for Economic Research is predicting a 17.8 % increase for Orange County in building_permit values this year , to $ 1.9 billion from $ 1.6 billion . The entire increase , Doti said , will come from increased home building . * Pent-up demand for housing after the minimal construction activity of the recession , he predicted , will nearly double housing production to about 13 # 000 units a year through the end of the decade . Adibi said he expects about 9 # 800 jobs to be added this year in the Inland Empire , where locally based employment remained constant during the recession . But construction in Riverside and San Bernardino counties will remain weak throughout 1994 , he predicted , and home prices are likely to drop 2.5 % following a 4.6 % average decline last year . Except for its emphasis on improvement in the Orange County economy , the Chapman midyear report is quite similar to a statewide study issued earlier this week by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project . In both reports , economists said California ' s economic recovery is under way but being held_back by interest_rate increases and continuing layoffs in aerospace . Chapman ' s Doti , however , disagrees_with UCLA forecasters , who maintain that income losses caused by January ' s Northridge earthquake are holding_back growth . There have been income losses , Doti said , &quot; but the spending that will result from the rebuilding effort will make_up for them .</TEXT>
