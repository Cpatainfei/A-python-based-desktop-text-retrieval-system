   <HEADLINE> SUMO DESERVES BETTER THAN A BELLY_LAUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sumo finally breaches the surface of an American newspaper ( &quot; One Sport Where a Match Is a Dinner Break , &quot; Laugh_Lines , May 24 ) and all we get is adolescent snickering over the same three stale , cliched jokes : They eat so_much . The matches are over quickly.They ' re so faaaat ! ! Not to mention the completely erroneous designation of the sport as sumo &quot; wrestling. &quot; Of course the article was intended as humor . But at the risk of sounding cranky and humorless , may I please point_out that quite a_few Americans are legitimately interested in sumo as a sport , and that many_more would be were it not that the only coverage it receives is unpleasantly close to ridicule ? Why not describe the techniques used by the rikishi , their years of rigorous training , their dedication to their sport -- which far exceeds that of spoiled , overpaid , drug-addled American athletes -- and the fact that many_a middle-aged businessman carries a higher percentage of body fat ? Sumo can be enjoyed as an exciting sport without resorting_to either drooling cultural reverence or characterization as the human equivalent of monster trucks . Those who wish to pursue thoughtful exchange on the grand sport of sumo are invited to contact the Pasadena Sumo Assn. , 686 S . Arroyo Parkway , Suite 299 , Pasadena , Calif . 91105 . ALEXA I .
