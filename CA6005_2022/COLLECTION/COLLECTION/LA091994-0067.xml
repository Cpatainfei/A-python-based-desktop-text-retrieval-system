   <HEADLINE> ALASKANS SHOW MIXED EMOTIONS ON EXXON RULING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Small commercial fishermen in this quiet port , among those pounded the hardest by the devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill , aren ' t throwing any parties to celebrate the $ 5-billion verdict delivered by a federal jury Friday against Exxon . Though most felt a weary triumph , and surprise , at the size of the punitive damages award , no one expects that much money to ever get here . Of more immediate concern was the job of unloading gear from their boats , as they ended their halibut and silver_salmon seasons . &quot; I felt better that the jury judged Exxon ' s story and said , ' Yeah , you should pay , you were responsible , ' &quot; said Chris Nerison , as he gazed over the 1 # 000 boats in Cordova harbor during the drizzly Sunday afternoon . But even Nerison , who fishes for salmon and herring , never expects anything close to $ 5 billion to wind_up in plaintiffs ' pockets . And other fishermen doubt they will get anything . &quot; I don ' t think so , &quot; said Thea Thomas , over a cup of coffee at The Reluctant Fisherman Inn . She fishes commercially for salmon and herring . At least she fished for herring until the fish failed to show_up last year , cutting her income by one-third . &quot; Any upbeat mood is because we ' ve had a pretty good year for the first time since the spill , &quot; she said , &quot; not the judgment. &quot; Thomas noted that the grinding pressure of poor fishing in various species , squeamishness over the quality of Alaskan fish -- particularly in Japan -- and other problems had plagued the fishing community year after year since the Exxon Valdez ran_aground in 1989 , producing the biggest oil spill in North_American history . Families broke_up , people committed suicide , parents couldn ' t send their kids to college , and the town ' s schools and library cut_back personnel and hours as fishermen had trouble paying boat mortgages while the litigation ground on . &quot; The banks let them go_for a_few years , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; Many lost their boats just in the last two years . It took a while for people to go broke. &quot; &quot; We ' ve taken a series of economic hits , &quot; said Margy K . Johnson , an innkeeper and the mayor of Cordova . &quot; One knocks you to your knees , a series renders you down and out. &quot; The punitive damage award -- or whatever survives Exxon ' s planned legal challenges -- will be apportioned among all plaintiffs winning claims for actual damages from the spill , including about 10 # 000 fishermen and at least 4 # 000 others -- from native villagers who lost subsistence harvests to such coastal businesses as fish hatcheries and processors . Brian O ' Neill , the Minneapolis lawyer who led the plaintiffs ' legal team , estimated that fishermen will receive anywhere from $ 25 # 000 to $ 250 # 000 each in punitive damages , with the payouts hinging_on their former production . An estimated $ 1 billion will be divided up by the 82 law_firms representing plaintiffs in the case . The $ 5 billion in punitive damages is second in the U.S. courts only to the $ 10.5-billion award Pennzoil won in 1985 from Texaco Corp . The Exxon decision dwarfs what had been the biggest civil award in an environmental case -- the $ 470 million that Union Carbide paid because of its role in the tragic chemical leak in Bhopal , India , in 1984 that killed 4 # 000 people . O ' Neill agreed with the skeptics in Cordova that the plaintiffs are unlikely to receive punitive damages anytime soon , though he expressed confidence the award eventually will arrive . &quot; I guess we ' ll slug it out for another year or so before we get the appeals out of the way , &quot; he said . &quot; I feel relieved that I ' m not going_to go_down in history as the world ' s biggest loser , &quot; added O ' Neill , who has worked_on the case since 1989 . Given the vast environmental disaster in this case , he asked rhetorically , &quot; How could you lose to Exxon ? &quot; For its part , Exxon says it already has paid $ 3.5 billion in cleanup costs . Also , in a previous phase of the trial , jurors awarded commercial fishermen $ 287 million for actual damages to their livelihood . Exxon also agreed to pay 3 # 500 native Alaskans $ 20 million in place of food they normally would have caught in Alaskan waters . Still to come_in the Exxon case are smaller trials , including what U.S. District Judge Russel Holland is terming the &quot; fourth phase &quot; of this summer ' s three-part trial . This case , which will be held before a new jury , will include halibut fishermen , shrimp fishermen , lodge owners , helicopter leasing firms and others citing lost income after the spill . Over in Valdez , the petroleum town where the Exxon Valdez took_on its fateful cargo , most workers and contractors on this end of the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline were glad to see Prince William Sound ' s hard-pressed commercial fishermen stand to be the potential beneficiaries of much of Friday ' s judgment . Over the clamor of a local rock_band Saturday night in The Pipeline Club -- where according to court testimony , Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood went drinking hours before his tanker left port -- there was sympathy for the fishermen as well . &quot; The oil field reaction is that they go_along with the fishermen , that Exxon deserves everything they get . They ' re people too , &quot; said one contractor for Alyeska . &quot; We ' re all happy they got something ; they haven ' t had anything , for years , &quot; said June Morgan , tending bar at the Club Bar , a fishermen ' s hangout near the Valdez harbor .
