   <HEADLINE> POSTSCRIPT ; GERMANY TAKES NEW LOOK_AT BUCHENWALD ' S HISTORY ; COMMUNIST-ERA EXHIBITS WILL BE OVERHAULED TO REFLECT SOVIET ROLE AND THE DIVERSITY OF INMATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In front of the barbed-wire fence and iron gate of Buchenwald concentration_camp stands a refurbished bear house , part of what once was the Buchenwald Zoological Garden for Nazi guards and their children in World_War_II . In the forest behind the wind-swept camp , temporary crosses and stones mark mass graves for thousands of inmates who died in Buchenwald after the war , when Soviet occupation forces held prisoners there . These new markers signal a sweeping renovation of Buchenwald memorials , one that historians say will give a broader and more accurate view of the camp near this historic German town about 150 miles southwest of Berlin . The current displays were designed by the Communist government of the former East_Germany and tend to glorify German Communist inmates ' resistance to the Nazis while giving short_shrift to the plight of Jews , Gypsies and other people who were imprisoned in the camp during World_War_II . There is no mention at all_of the Soviet-era camp operation in the displays . &quot; We want a historically true , proportional picture of the concentration_camp to be presented to the public , &quot; said Stuttgart University historian Eberhard Jaeckel , chairman of the committee overseeing the changes . &quot; There was an over-accentuation of Communist prisoners ( under the East_German administration ) . The commission realized early on that the role of Jewish inmates was neglected , that , in the last years of the war , more_than 90 % of the inmates were foreigners -- Poles and Russians. &quot; Under the new plan announced last month , the East_German portrait of Buchenwald will itself become an exhibit , Jaeckel said , &quot; to show how the camp was used to produce legitimacy for the regime of the German Democratic Republic. &quot; Politics , as before , will play a role in the depictions of what happened at Buchenwald . This renovation has been controversial , particularly among former Communist inmates who believe rightists are rewriting their history to play_down the resistance , and among Jews who fear that Nazi and Soviet crimes will be put_on a par ; about 56 # 000 people died in Buchenwald under the Nazis and about 7 # 100 under the Soviets , but many of the latter victims were Nazis . Museum officials have tried to assuage these concerns . The new museum plan calls_for three separate exhibits : the principal exhibit on the Nazi camp from 1937 to 1945 ; a smaller one on the Soviet era from 1945 to 1950 , and a third on East_Germany ' s use of Buchenwald as a museum until 1989 . The museum will be shut_down in the fall_for renovation and reopen next April for the 50th anniversary of the camp ' s liberation by Allied forces . Rikola Luettgenau , a historian who has helped to shape the concept for the new museum , says that East_German curators operated under the motto &quot; Preserve the fire from the past , not the ashes. &quot; Consequently , he says , the museum did not adequately show the horrors of World_War_II Buchenwald , the SS officers and how the camp fit into the Nazi state . Buchenwald was not only a prison and sometime execution camp . It was also a training center for 3 # 000 to 4 # 000 Waffen SS troops , and it provided forced labor for V-2 rocket production in an underground factory at an adjacent camp , Mittelbau-Dora . Waffen SS men and their families lived just outside the perimeter of Buchenwald ; the zoo was established to provide them with amusement and relief from job stress . &quot; For the SS , it was not a problem to have a zoo 20 meters in front of a crematory . We want visitors to ask these questions : Why did the SS have a zoo ? How did they live_in two worlds , a zoo and a concentration_camp ? &quot; Luettgenau said . Buchenwald was built_in 1937 to imprison Nazi political enemies . The following year , ethnic inmates -- Jews , Poles and others who did not fit into the Nazi scheme -- were locked behind the gate with iron letters spelling &quot; Jedem Das Seine &quot; ( &quot; To Each What He Deserves &quot; ) . More_than 250 # 000 people passed_through Buchenwald under the Nazis . The camp was not a mass extermination center_on the scale of Auschwitz , but thousands were executed . At least 8 # 484 Soviet prisoners_of_war were shot ; other prisoners were shot , hanged or received lethal injections ; many_more died of hunger and disease . Under East_German curators , the crematory became a memorial to Ernst Thaelmann , &quot; a leader of the German working_class &quot; shot in front of the building on Aug . 18 , 1944 . The plaque honoring him will remain under the new plan but with additional information , such_as the fact that he also was a member of the prewar German Parliament . Because Communists were among the first prisoners in Buchenwald , they held positions of power within the camp organization . They organized secret resistance groups that experimented with making explosives in a camp cellar , collected weapons and saved hundreds of children from starvation and death . At the end of the war , they helped keep prisoners from being marched_out of the camp with fleeing SS troops . But not all Communist inmates will be treated as heroes . Communist_Party files opened after the fall of the Berlin Wall_in 1989 suggest that some prisoners collaborated with the SS . Others apparently put the names of Jews and Gypsies on lists of inmates to be shipped out of Buchenwald , replacing their own comrades . Another exhibit will mention that some inmates working_at the camp hospital used lethal injections to kill prisoners whom they believed to be spies , and that power struggles between inmate groups also led to killings . The history of the liberation of the camp , and of Germany , also is being broadened . Communist camp survivors talk_of the camp ' s &quot; self-liberation , &quot; and indeed , inmates did take_over the guard towers and raise white_flags in the camp two days before the end . But the East_German exhibits showed only Red Army flags after the war , even though American soldiers were the first of the Allies to arrive_at Buchenwald . After the war , in exchange for part of Berlin , the Americans swapped control of Thuringen state with the Soviets , who took_control of the area . Buchenwald became the Soviets ' Special Camp No . 2 , one of seven in the occupation zone . Weimar residents say they knew the Soviets used the camp , but talk_of this was taboo in the old East_Germany . In 1990 , however , museum officials dug_up mass graves from the Stalin era confirming what everyone suspected -- that many inmates had died under the Soviets too . The graveyard will be permanently marked and integrated into the new exhibit on the Soviet era . Many of the current exhibits , meanwhile , will pass into the historical section on Buchenwald during the Communist East_German era .</TEXT>
