   <HEADLINE> NO END PREDICTED TO NOVELL-MICROSOFT RIVALRY ; COMPUTERS : DESPITE TALKS , COMPETITION IN NETWORKING WILL REMAIN FIERCE , ANALYSTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Novell Inc. and Microsoft Corp . will remain fierce competitors in computer networking and business applications despite the easing of hostilities between the two companies , analysts said . Novell ' s new chief_executive , Robert Frankenberg , met with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates last month for a broad discussion on cooperation between the two companies , Microsoft officials said Tuesday . &quot; There was nothing formal that came_out of it , &quot; said Bob Kruger , Microsoft director of strategic relations and standards . &quot; They talked_about getting_together a_couple_of times a year. &quot; Nevertheless , some analysts said they were pleased to hear about the meeting after years of antagonism toward Microsoft by recently retired Novell Chairman Ray Noorda . It was under Noorda that Novell actively encouraged investigations of Microsoft ' s business practices . The probes by European and U.S._government agencies were settled last month with an agreement widely seen as a victory for Microsoft , the world ' s largest software company . Analysts said Frankenberg ' s July 7 meeting with Gates at Microsoft ' s Redmond , Wash. , headquarters apparently signals an era of improved cooperation that could benefit customers who use products made by both firms . But they said the companies will remain fiercely competitive , both in Novell ' s core area of computer networking and in the word-processing and spreadsheet areas Novell recently entered through its acquisition of WordPerfect and Borland ' s Quattro Pro spreadsheet products . &quot; These two companies are_on a collision course , and it ' s their destiny to be competitive with each other , but they also need to work together , &quot; said Rick Sherlund , an analyst with Goldman Sachs . He and others said customers such_as big firms that use software made by both companies could benefit from any improvement in cooperation between Provo , Utah-based Novell and Microsoft . &quot; The level of complexity is increasing every day , and you want your vendors talking to each other , &quot; said Paul Merenbloom of Piper Jaffray . * Customers have complained that Microsoft ' s Windows operating software does not work well with Novell ' s Netware , which dominates personal_computer networking with 80 % of the market . Microsoft ' s Kruger acknowledged those complaints and said Microsoft is dedicated to improving the compatibility of Windows and Netware , including through the imminent release of Windows NT 3.5 , the latest version of its advanced operating system . He also said he hopes that with Novell being headed by Frankenberg , whom he described as &quot; more level-headed and pragmatic &quot; than Noorda , the two companies can make progress in other areas , such_as providing better service to customers that have mixed systems . Merenbloom noted that Microsoft and Novell have necessarily had professional working relationships for years despite the hostility between their top_executives . &quot; This isn ' t breaking_down the Berlin Wall , &quot; he said . Nonetheless , he said the meeting was an example of Frankenberg ' s determination to make changes &quot; which go right down into the cultural fibers of the company. &quot; &quot; I think what we ' re seeing from Frankenberg is the beginning of a restructuring of Novell , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
