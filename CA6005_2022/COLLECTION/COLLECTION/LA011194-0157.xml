   <HEADLINE> MILITARY INTERVENTION IN BOSNIA HIGH ON THE AGENDA ; SUMMIT : SOME URGE USING LONG-DEBATED NATO AIR STRIKES TO LIFT SIEGE OF SARAJEVO . OTHERS COUNSEL CAUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The thorny issue of military intervention in Bosnia pushed its way high onto the agenda of the first day of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization summit here Monday . As a communique was being drafted that would declare the organization ' s readiness to act against Serbian rebels in Bosnia-Herzegovina , some NATO leaders urged that the alliance employ long-debated air strikes to lift the siege of Sarajevo , while others counseled caution . President Clinton had set the tone of the debate in the morning by warning that any threats of intervention to relieve the &quot; strangulation &quot; of the Bosnian capital and other besieged areas had to be more_than mere words . &quot; The alliance must be prepared to act , &quot; the President told his NATO colleagues . Referring to the declaration to be issued at the close of the summit today , Clinton added : &quot; If we are going_to reassert this warning , it cannot be seen as mere rhetoric . Those who attack Sarajevo must understand that we are serious . &quot; In voting for this language , I expect ( NATO ) to take action when necessary. &quot; Earlier , NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner had told the assembled leaders , &quot; NATO has done everything which the United Nations have asked of it in the former Yugoslavia and we have done so rapidly and efficiently. &quot; The language concerning Bosnia in the draft of the final summit declaration repeated NATO ' s pledge that the alliance stood ready &quot; to carry_out air strikes in_order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo , the safe areas and other threatened areas. &quot; It was unclear whether NATO might consider targeting the battling Bosnian Croats and Muslims as well as the Serbs besieging Sarajevo . NATO leaders had hoped to downplay the Bosnian issue at this summit and concentrate instead on the &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; -- the offer to East European_countries to link up eventually with NATO . But the_French , who have the largest contingent of troops in the former Yugoslav federation , argued that the Bosnian issue be raised . The United Nations ' overall commander in the Balkans , French Gen . Jean Cot , has complained that he lacks authority from U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to defend soldiers engaged in humanitarian efforts . The French were supported by Belgian Prime_Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene , who after meeting Clinton on Sunday night , declared : &quot; We must seriously consider whether to carry_out air strikes . I think more and more countries agree that we should do this . We must give a signal. &quot; But British Prime_Minister John Major , who has often urged caution in the use of outside force in Bosnia , declared Monday morning that NATO should consider what &quot; realistic help &quot; could be given to &quot; keep Bosnians alive and encourage the peace process. &quot; But the Germans and Dutch repeated Clinton ' s assertion that Sarajevo must_not be allowed to be strangled by the Serbian siege . The issue of military intervention has been a touchy one for the nations of NATO , an organization that has been accused of dragging its feet over assistance to Bosnia ' s beleaguered Muslims . Woerner , sensitive to charges that NATO is a paper tiger with no real role in the post-Cold War era , has indicated his willingness to back NATO ' s use of air strikes and commitment of ground troops to police a cease-fire in Bosnia in the event of a peace settlement . But NATO maintains that any action must be approved by the U.N. Security_Council . Those in favor of military intervention in Bosnia say that it will save the Muslim community , defend established national boundaries , deny aggressors the fruits of their conquest and keep other countries in Eastern Europe from practicing &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; Opponents say that air strikes will only increase the bloodshed in the former Yugoslav republic , kill innocent civilians and risk retaliation against the Western soldiers currently serving under U.N. helmets to protect aid convoys . And in the end , they say , bombing will not stop the fighting .</TEXT>
