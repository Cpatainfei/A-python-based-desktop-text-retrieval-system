   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TEAM MOUNTS BLITZ TO SALVAGE HEALTH REFORM ; INSURANCE : CABINET OFFICIALS STREAM TO CAPITOL_HILL IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO RESCUE THE FLOUNDERING LEGISLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clinton_Administration Cabinet officials blitzed Capitol_Hill Friday in an urgent effort to rescue floundering health_care reform legislation . With the House Democratic leadership having chosen to delay action on health_care indefinitely , the Senate -- which is divided along partisan lines -- plodded deliberately through a fourth day of floor debate on its version of reform . The Administration is far short of assembling majorities in either house of Congress for its plans to provide universal health_insurance coverage . Ten Cabinet secretaries and other high-ranking members of the Clinton team huddled with the President for a morning breakfast then headed to Capitol_Hill for closed-door meetings with wavering Democratic members of Congress , who are refusing to support the blueprints of the party ' s own leadership . Offering an upbeat view , Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said the Cabinet was &quot; riled up and enthusiastic. &quot; &quot; The test of this Administration is not whether we ' re going to trip every once in a while but whether we ' re going to get_up , brush ourselves off and get_out there and keep working , &quot; she said after leaving the White_House . But the mood among Democrats in Congress was much more somber . In the House , there seems scant chance of success for the proposal put_together by Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) . It would require all firms to provide insurance for their workers , with the companies picking_up 80 % of the cost . House leaders said Friday that they will turn their attention to other issues before taking_up health_care . &quot; There ' s no magic date here , &quot; said House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) , deepening the gloomy assessment he offered Thursday when he announced that the debate scheduled for next week had been scrapped . &quot; We ' re going to take it up when it ' s ready to be brought_up , &quot; Foley told reporters , leaving open prospects for continued delay that might kill the bill ' s chances in this election year . Small business fiercely opposes the employer mandate contained in the Gephardt proposal . Hoping to disarm this opposition , Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) devised a plan calling_for voluntary expansion of insurance protection to bring coverage to 95 % of all citizens . If this voluntary effort does not work , a mandate would take_effect in the year 2002 in states where coverage did not reach the 95 % goal . The delayed mandate would require companies to contribute at least 50 % of the cost of insurance , less burdensome to business than the Gephardt formula . However , all Republicans and a significant number of dissenting Democrats seem unalterably opposed to any government requirement that employers provide health_insurance , whether the mandate takes_effect immediately or is held_in reserve . The Senate continued its debate Friday but members clearly had been shaken by the developments in the House -- the double blow of the delay on health_care and the unexpected defeat of the President ' s crime bill on a procedural vote . &quot; The Senate has entered the extremely frightened zone , &quot; said one senior Democratic aide . &quot; What they ' re doing out there today now is faking it. &quot; However , the aide said that Mitchell continues to make alterations in his bill to try to win votes , one senator at a time . Most of those changes , he said , are additions to the benefits package that have been demanded by various constituencies . As floor debate continued Friday , Sen . Christopher J . Dodd ( D-Conn. ) offered the first formal amendment to the bill , a proposal requiring all health_insurance policies sold after July , 1995 , to include prenatal care_for pregnant women and immunizations and check-ups for children . No significant test votes seem likely in the Senate until next week .</TEXT>
