   <HEADLINE> NO HAITI INVASION BEFORE SEPTEMBER , OFFICIALS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a steady drumbeat of threats aimed at frightening Haitian military_leaders out of power , the Clinton_Administration has set_aside any plan for armed intervention here until September at the earliest , U.S. and foreign officials said Tuesday . The main reason is practical , the officials said : The U.N. force that would be needed to provide order on the island after U.S. troops came ashore will not be ready before the fall . At the same time , Administration officials noted , Democratic leaders in Congress have asked President Clinton to hold_off , expressing fears that the U.S. public is not yet convinced that an invasion is justified . &quot; I don ' t think we ' re talking months , &quot; a senior U.S. official said when asked how long the option of military_action was being delayed , &quot; but weeks , sure. &quot; Asked if that meant that no invasion was likely before September , he nodded affirmatively . In Washington , a State_Department official involved in Haiti policy said it is becoming clear that no military_action would be launched in August . &quot; I don ' t think we ' re moving that fast , &quot; he said . And in Jerusalem , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said he is willing to wait for some time before recommending an invasion . &quot; I think we need to see if the sanctions won ' t work , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; The new , enhanced sanctions have only been in_effect for a limited period_of_time . Clearly nobody thinks the use of force is the most attractive option . . . . It may come_to that , but the President has not made that decision . He is continuing to go_forward with the ( sanctions ) , trying to put the maximum amount of pressure on the illegal government. &quot; The officials ' estimates conflicted with the Administration ' s own public threats against the regime of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the military_leader who overthrew Haiti ' s elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , in 1991 . Only a week ago , in Berlin , Clinton said the Cedras regime ' s continued existence is intolerable . &quot; We have got_to bring an end to this , &quot; he declared . But even while he is keeping the military option on the table , Clinton still hopes that Cedras will decide to leave without an armed confrontation , the officials said . Diplomats in the Haitian_capital said the main factor delaying military_action is the inability of the United States and its key allies to assemble an international force to handle peacekeeping duties after any invasion . A U.S. diplomat said there are three crucial problems in forming the force , which could include more_than 15 # 000 troops and civilian experts -- &quot; finance , mandate and command and control &quot; -- meaning the countries involved in organizing the plan have not settled_on how to pay_for the force , what it is supposed to achieve and who would run the operation . Those are major obstacles , said a diplomat from a country that has been asked to contribute to the force . &quot; Those three elements are the defining ones . Without all three in place , there is no international force. &quot; He added that his government ' s assessment is that it will take &quot; two or three months &quot; before the international unit is in place . &quot; My government will not take_part as things stand now , &quot; he said . He added that &quot; we fully expect the issues to be settled. &quot; The U.S. diplomat , looking distressed , agreed that &quot; nothing will happen ( regarding armed action ) until all three &quot; disagreements are resolved . Part of the problem is a change in the design of the international force . The original idea , which grew from negotiations between the Haitian military and Aristide in 1993 , was for a small U.N. force that would retrain the Haitian military and police as part of a settlement . But the force now under_consideration would be a much larger , U.S.-led operation that would maintain order , guarantee the safety of the Aristide government and the military and assume some degree of civil control . That shift is a major factor_in the difficulty of putting_together the force , according to other diplomats , because it costs far more and changes the role from one essentially of trainer to occupier . Last week , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Madeleine Albright , said a dozen or so nations , including some in Latin_America and the Caribbean , had agreed to join the United States in a peacekeeping force . But diplomats interviewed Tuesday stressed that those countries ' commitments are tentative . The nations include Argentina , Barbados , Belize , Brazil , Canada , Chile , France , Guyana , Jamaica , Panama , Suriname and Trinidad . Domestic U.S. politics are also a consideration in any possible Haiti actions , according to officials here and in Washington . Democratic leaders in Congress have warned Clinton that the public is not ready for military intervention and urged him to give economic sanctions longer to work . Last week , Senate Democratic leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) all weighed in publicly against an invasion . Administration officials said they took the legislators ' views seriously but refused to say whether they had pushed_back the possible time frame for military_action . Anthony Lake , Clinton ' s national security adviser , acknowledged Tuesday that the congressional leaders had urged caution and said the Administration promised to &quot; consult &quot; with Congress further before an invasion is launched . He suggested that Clinton would expect the nation to rally behind the U.S. forces . &quot; If the President were to order a military operation in Haiti , he would certainly go_to some lengths to explain to the American people with precision what our interests are , what the mission is . . . ( and ) when we expect to accomplish it , &quot; he said . Clinton faces a political dilemma in considering the timing of an invasion of Haiti , but it is long-term rather than short-term . Administration officials and military_officers said a well-planned U.S. invasion would take a_few days , at most , to overwhelm Haiti ' s lightly armed 7 # 000-member army . The problem , they said , would come afterward -- when U.S. and allied troops try to restore order . Supporters of the military regime already have threatened to go underground in the face of an invasion so they can launch terrorist attacks against occupation troops . Any peacekeeping operation would require &quot; many months , &quot; Christopher warned earlier this month . Freed reported from Port-au-Prince and McManus from Washington .</TEXT>
