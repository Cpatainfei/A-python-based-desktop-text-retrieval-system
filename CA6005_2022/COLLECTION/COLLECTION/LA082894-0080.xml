   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S ON THE MOVE , WHY DOES IT STAND_STILL ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a time of great change and national confusion , after a season of violence and rumor , Mexicans voted for the political_party that promised them least . Ernesto Zedillo , of Mexico ' s antiquated Institutional Revolution ary Party , was elected president . The PRI , as the ruling party is popularly called , is as truly a Mexican invention as the taco or machismo . It has ruled Mexico for most of this century ; it owes its endurance to a Mexican fear of chaos and a yearning for orden . Polls last week indicated that the older the voter , the more likely he or she was to vote for the PRI . The old in Mexico remember the early decades of this century -- the blood and the bodies -- as Mexican killed Mexican , and the victors romantically proclaimed the civil_war to be &quot; la Revolucion. &quot; After the Revolution , the PRI gave Mexico the stability of compromise . The Institutional Revolutionary Party , as its name implies , sought to reconcile institutional pragmatism with revolutionary rhetoric . Its genius was as go-between , mediating among competing Mexicos -- business and labor , land owners and peasants . Mexicans tolerated the PRI ' s corruption and mischief in exchange for orden . Though after extraordinary corruption in the presidential palace and the near-collapse of the economy in the early ' 80s , Mexicans wondered if the PRI was an invention appropriate to the age of steam . Last week , flush with victory , Zedillo offered to &quot; dialogue &quot; with the opposition parties . The PRI was thus again trying to play its role as mediator . In recent years , however , the ruling party has been torn by internal conflicts , pitting party_bosses ( &quot; dinosaurs &quot; ) against Ivy League &quot; technocrats. &quot; Rumors persist that PRI bosses were behind the assassination earlier this year of_their_own party ' s candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , in Tijuana . For the moment , the PRI represents an odd marriage of Tammany_Hall politicos and Ivy League graduates . Yale-educated Zedillo replaces Harvard-educated Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Many Americans say they will miss Salinas . People sigh : &quot; At last , Mexico had a president who spoke our language. &quot; But Salinas was preceded to the United States by peasants who journeyed north looking_for work after the Revolution . Decades before Salinas introduced microeconomics to Mexico , Mexican peasants returned from the United States with rumors of dollars and Frank Sinatra records . In Mexico_City today , there are fancy new hotels and international boutiques to cater to business_executives from all_over the world . But all_over Mexico , the poor are_on the move . And the poor in Mexico are getting younger and younger -- the average age is 15 . Half of Mexico has yet to reach puberty . Half of Mexico wasn ' t of_age to vote this time around . Zedillo is not the face of future Mexico . Mexico is a teen-age girl . She has acne , but is just beginning to date . She wears a T-shirt that reads &quot; HARD ROCK CAFE. &quot; Mexico is looking_for a job . Mexico is_on the move , leaving the village for the city , leaving custom for possibility , leaving home for Monterrey , Mexico , or for Monterey , Calif . We Americans , of course , are terrified of teen-aged Mexico . We much prefer Mexicans with Harvard degrees . During the debate over the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , not a_few in the United States wondered : How are we ever going_to compete with a teen-ager who is willing to earn in a day what we pay ourselves for an hour ? For decades , cynics in Mexico noted the way the PRI &quot; points to the left and then moves to the right. &quot; The rhetoric of the party was fiery and leftist ; the interest of the party was power , held tightly from on top -- an oligarchy of media billionaires , police_chiefs with mansions and presidential relatives with millions invested in tourist hotels . This year , what distinguished the presidential elections was the presence of two true opposition parties -- one on each flank of the PRI . On the left stood Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party . The last time around , six years ago , Cardenas came_close enough to winning the presidential race to require massive fraud by the PRI . This year , the rhetoric and the revolutionary agenda -- the old nationalism and state-development model -- were soundly defeated . After an Indian rebellion in Chiapas and the kidnaping of millionaires in Mexico_City , Mexicans were wary of the rhetoric that had romanced their grandfathers . On the right , coming_in second , was the National Action Party ' s candidate , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos . The PAN is pro-business , friendly to the Catholic_Church , friendly as well to U.S. business interests . It emerged from the elections as the party of Mexico ' s middle_class -- something new in Mexico ' s history . Imagine a parade : In the Election_Day parade , the campesinos and the university Marxists rode the PRD float . The blond beauty queens and the Northern Mexican business_executives were_on the PAN float . On the PRI float , there was Zedillo , surrounded by overweight labor chiefs and pale MIT graduates . The PRI float had the least glamour . Yet , the PRI won . It was as though Mexicans were voting for nothing . It was as though the PRI victory was hollow . Talking to Mexicans last week , I had the sense that the vote for the PRI was not one of affection or ideological solidarity . People , rather , wanted the status_quo . Mexicans chose the PRI because it promised least . &quot; Poor Mexico , &quot; goes the old saw . &quot; So far from God , so close to the United States. &quot; If Americans in recent years have feared proximity to Mexican teen-agers in the international labor_market , Mexicans have their own reason to worry . For generations , Mexicans have called people in the United States &quot; norteamericanos. &quot; ( It was the polite way of saying &quot; gringos. &quot; ) Now , of course , after NAFTA , Mexico is waking_up to the idea that she , too , is a norteamericana . Her future is tied to her old antagonist , the gringo , and to Canada , a country she barely knows . In Southwestern United States , Americans fret about illegal aliens . Throughout Mexico , there are Wal-Marts and satellite dishes that pull_in the Playboy Channel and the Dallas Cowboys . Mexico broods : As her future turns north , how shall she remain distinctly separate ? Mexican ? The persons who have fewest answers are those at the top . The writers , the academics , the politicians of Mexico are offering Mexico no idea of what she is becoming . The dreams , the ambitions , the schemes are coming from the bottom of society . Mexico is stirring , moving , growing . Mexico is starting to shave . Mexico is converting to evangelical Protestantism or listening to Madonna . Mexico wants a job washing dishes at the new Italian restaurant on Sunset Boulevard . Had there been fraud in the elections ? The international cast of observers assembled in Mexico thought the fraud was less than usual . The PRI didn ' t , after all , need to steal ballots or stuff the ballot_boxes with the names of the dead . After all , the PRI had an easy victory . Yale would replace Harvard at the Mexican White_House , Los Pinos . But at a time of Indian rebellions and rock_concerts ; at a time of kidnapings and NFL football games in Mexico_City ; at a time when everything was changing everywhere in Mexico , it only seemed last week that nothing had changed .</TEXT>
