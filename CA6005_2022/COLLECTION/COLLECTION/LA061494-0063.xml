   <HEADLINE> WORLD_VIEW ; RICH-POOR GAP WIDENS AROUND THE GLOBE ; ABOUT 20 % OF THE EARTH ' S PEOPLE NOW CONTROL NEARLY 85 % OF ITS WEALTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 20th Century , an era of unparalleled economic progress and improved living conditions , may ultimately be judged instead by a starkly different trend : the staggering gap between rich and poor . The latest numbers reveal painful divisions . At the close of the century , the richest 1 billion people -- or 20 % of world population -- control almost 85 % of global wealth , while the poorest 1 billion command less than 2 % , according to the new Human Development Report , a survey by the U.N. Development Program . The disparity means the top layer of society earns 60 times the income of the bottom , a gap that has doubled -- from 30 to 1 -- in just three decades . The bottom_line : In the mid-1990s the meek show no signs of inheriting the Earth . Nowhere are the dimensions of the gap and its impact more egregious than here on the Arabian_Peninsula . Despite modest oil discoveries in the 1980s , Yemen is growing poorer compared to its oil-rich neighbor Saudi_Arabia . The paltry per capita income in the Arab world ' s poorest country plummeted 14 % between 1989 and 1992 , to $ 1 # 374 . Even before a civil_war erupted in Yemen last month , poverty permeated Sana , the capital and legendary city reputedly founded by Noah ' s son Shem . A downtown section has been transformed by hovels made of plastic cartons and large tin_cans held together by baked mud . &quot; Night City , &quot; where cinder-block homes were illegally erected overnight , has sprouted on the capital ' s hilly outskirts . And across from the Yemeni president ' s home , squatters have pulled_together a vast camp from bits of old tin , plastic sheeting , wood and stones . The ominous gap between rich and poor is evident around the globe . &quot; The underlying factor_in all this world disorder is the sheer power of uncontrolled great wealth in the hands of a_few nations , coexisting with the absolute poverty everywhere . The laws of the jungle operate , &quot; former Tanzanian President Julius K . Nyerere has written_of the post-Cold War world . &quot; The rich developed countries continue to get richer and more developed while the poor stay poor -- not always only relatively . In the last decade the peoples of Latin_America and of Africa , as well as in many parts of Asia , have seen their desperately low standard_of_living decline even further . The income and technology gap between North and South gets geometrically wider all_the time. &quot; According to U.N. figures , poverty is the most acute problem of the developing world . More_than a third of the people in these countries live below the poverty_line . Worldwide , more_than 1 billion people are surviving on the equivalent of $ 1 a day . Disparities between the prosperous and poor are visible in myriad ways : * In California , sixth-graders work_on computers in air-conditioned classrooms while kids in Mozambique use sticks and bark to learn to write in open-air classes . One of four South_African children does not go_to school at all . * A designer handbag in Paris costs $ 1 # 500 , more_than the annual per capita income in more_than 40 countries . * Media conglomerates merge in New York to open an information superhighway while 40 % of the population in Russia , so recently a superpower , plummets below the poverty_line . * Rival British and American shipping_companies vie to build the world ' s largest and most luxurious cruise liners while hundreds of thousands of homeless live atop massive garbage_dumps in Mexico_City and Manila . The poverty gap will affect both rich and or poor on every continent . Some regions now face being so powerless , so marginalized by poverty , that they will fall_off the world ' s political and economic map for generations . Other areas can expect an explosive backlash in a world where the communications revolution makes comparative living conditions highly visible . &quot; Poverty is the greatest threat to political stability , social cohesion and the environmental health of the planet , &quot; warns the new U.N. report . &quot; These disparities . . . deserve the urgent attention of policy-makers. &quot; The gap may even threaten the patterns of change . Shortly before his election as U.N. secretary_general in 1992 , Boutros Boutros-Ghali said bluntly in an article in the Mediterranean Quarterly : &quot; Democracy cannot take_root unless certain minimal institutions and an adequate living standard exist. &quot; In the post-Cold War world , where equality and empowerment are catchwords , the poverty gap is also a symbol of division . It is rapidly becoming a barometer of global trouble . &quot; A new Iron_Curtain between North and South . . . will be reinforced as a result of the gap between the standards_of_living in the rich and poor countries , &quot; Boutros-Ghali predicted . The result will be a &quot; process of marginalization &quot; that &quot; practically leaves no place for the Third_World or Africa , except where humanitarian aid is concerned , &quot; he concluded . The prospects for progress are not uniformly bleak . Between 1960 and 1992 &quot; all countries have made substantial progress in human development , &quot; the UNDP report notes . Over the past half a century , world income increased sevenfold ( in terms of real gross_domestic_product ) and income per person more_than tripled . The human development index -- calculated_on the basis of income , life_expectancy , literacy and education -- doubled in developed countries and increased by 80 % even in the poorest countries . &quot; But this gain has been spread very unequally -- nationally and internationally -- and the inequality is spreading , &quot; the report says . In the United States , Europe and Japan , for example , living conditions made unprecedented strides in 25 years . Average life_expectancy increased from 51 to 63 years . Average per capita consumption of goods and services increased by 70 % . And enrollment in primary education neared 90 % , according to the World_Bank . Yet worldwide , all but the richest 20 % saw their share of world income drop between 1960 and 1991 . And poverty drags_down the quality_of_life . In the squatter camps of Sana , the Yemeni capital , many toilets are no more_than holes_in_the_ground , and water must be bought from trucks . Few kids are in schools , and thousands of men with paintbrushes , shovels or squat daily on street_corners hoping to be hired . Up to 40 % of Yemen ' s labor_force is unemployed , and more_than one in five Yemenis lives in absolute poverty . Yemen ' s crisis is all_the more conspicuous in context . Across the border in Riyadh , the Saudi capital , construction costs for the new airport , the world ' s most modern , ran more_than half of Yemen ' s annual gross_domestic_product . The Saudi airport boasts an indoor oasis , 3 # 000 square_feet of stained-glass_windows , walls of marble quarried in Italy and etched with Koranic verses in England , and a bronze-domed mosque for 5 # 000 . But facilities like this tell only part of the story . On average , Saudis live 17 years longer than Yemenis , and only one-fifth as_many Saudi children die before age 5 , according to the UNDP report . The average Saudi has three years more education resulting in 23 % higher literacy . Petrodollars may have skewed the gap , but Saudi_Arabia -- which ranks 67th on the UNDP ' s human development index -- is far from the top rank . And at 142nd of 173 countries surveyed , Yemen is not the worst . However , the impact on the two Arab neighbors is symptomatic_of the poverty gap and its dangerous effects . &quot; Yemen has its own peculiar problems , but a lot of what is happening here is like what is happening in the world , &quot; said Amat Alim Sowswa , Yemen ' s deputy minister of information and its highest-ranking female official . &quot; As it gets_worse , we ' re going to witness a kind of revolution of the poor in all forms of unrest that is eventually bound to spill_over into rich areas too , &quot; she said . The lower end of the global gap is represented by the abysmal poverty in Africa , where many countries are worse off in the 1990s than they were at independence in the 1960s . In 1965 , Ghanaians were better_off than South_Koreans or Thais . The UNDP index now ranks South_Korea 32nd , Thailand 54th -- and Ghana 134th . World_Bank data suggests that even the most productive African_countries -- Ghana , Nigeria , Tanzania and Zimbabwe -- are unlikely to reduce poverty for at least another generation . At optimistic growth_rates , others could take decades to return to income levels of the 1970s -- and another half a century to turn the tide . With twice the U.S. population , Africa ' s total wealth is just slightly above Belgium ' s . The gap is not limited to income . In health services , industrial countries average one doctor per 400 people , while developing countries average one per 7 # 000 -- and some African states have only one per 36 # 000 , the UNDP reports . Wealth is most heavily concentrated in Latin_America . The inequities are the greatest in Brazil , Guatemala and Honduras . In Brazil , the top 20 % earn 32 times more_than the poorest 20 % -- up from 26 to 1 in just two years , the UNDP reports . The divide in Brazil is largely geographic , between the wealthy , industrialized south and the poor , largely agricultural north . The regional disparity includes 17 years in life_expectancy and 33 percentage_points in literacy and 40 % in per capita income . Elsewhere , the biggest challenge for post-apartheid South_Africa is the internal gap . It ranked 93rd on the UNDP index . But as a separate country , white South_Africa would rank 24th , above Spain , while black South_Africa would rank 123rd . &quot; Not just two different peoples , these are almost two different worlds , &quot; the UNDP concludes . The internal gap is not limited to poor countries . In the industrialized world , wage differentials in manufacturing also widened during the 1980s in 12 of 17 member countries surveyed by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development . Some reasons for the growing divisions are systemic , others political : * The collapse of socialism and its safety net of benefits , along with the introduction of competitive free markets , have led to soaring increases in both poverty and wealth in Asia , Africa and Europe . Conditions have declined most sharply in the former Soviet Bloc . They are now more critical than in the West during the 1930s Depression or Latin_American in the &quot; lost decade &quot; of the 1980s , according to a new UNICEF report . In nine former East Bloc countries -- Russia , Ukraine , Poland , Romania , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary and Albania -- plummeting gross_domestic_product levels have left 20 % to 70 % of the populations living_on or below the poverty_line . &quot; Some cases in the Second World are now worse than in the Third_World , &quot; said Eric Thurman , president of Opportunity International , a Chicago-based human development group . Internally , China ' s economic reforms have led to record growth -- and a record gap between vibrant urban_centers in Beijing and Shanghai and distant backwaters like Qinghai and Tibet . In Vietnam , economic liberalization has fostered both the rise of a new class of business people and brokers and an estimated 15 % unemployment . More_than 700 # 000 workers in state-owned companies have been let_go , while about 100 # 000 demobilized soldiers are jobless , contributing to a new class of street people . * Lengthy wars -- fought by forces oblivious to cost and allowed to drag_on by an uninterested post-Cold War world -- are setting_back Third_World countries to pre-colonial conditions . Paid_for by its diamonds and oil , Angola ' s two-decade-old civil_war has turned developed areas into shattered landscapes . Without outside aid , up_to half a_million people would soon starve there , relief groups say . The demise of the Cold_War also cost many countries virtually the only leverage they had in winning funds or attention from either East or West . * Aid still goes largely to former strategic allies rather than to poor countries . &quot; Aid is still based on the shadows of the past . The world has not adjusted its sights to post-Cold War realities , &quot; said Mahbub ul Haq , chief architect of the U.N. human development index . &quot; For example , the United States gave 16 times the amount per capita for El_Salvador over Bangladesh , which has a population 22 times larger and five times poorer than El_Salvador . But is El_Salvador such a strategic place today ? &quot; Based on current patterns , foreign_aid is unlikely to help close the gap . Often it perpetuates inequities . Better-off recipient countries get more_than $ 240 per person , for example , while the worst-off states often get less than $ 1 per person a year , reports the Overseas Development Council . * Inefficiency , corruption , bad_debts , protectionism and skewed priorities also deserve much of the blame . &quot; At a time the entire world is reducing military expenditures an average of 3.6 % a year , the two poorest regions of the world -- sub-Sahara Africa and South Asia -- are increasing spending on arms , &quot; Haq said . India and Pakistan have for several years spent nearly twice as much on arms as Saudi_Arabia , which is 20 times richer , he added . In contrast , Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948 and invested a third of its resources in health , education and housing . It ' s now the most prosperous Central_American_country , with one of the highest human development ratings in the Third_World . Unlike East Asia ' s major investments in basic education and health , most African_countries decreased social expenditures in the 1980s -- up_to 64 % in Gambia , 70 % in Nigeria and 82 % in Sierra_Leone , the World_Bank reported . * Several countries with adequate resources to narrow the gap are choosing not to address poverty . &quot; Brazil is rich enough to deal with poverty problems and so is the United States . We ' re not for the same reason Brazil isn ' t : We don ' t want to , &quot; said John W . Sewell , president of the Overseas Development Council in Washington . Despite the gap , human progress is likely to continue to make significant strides . &quot; Social indicators -- average literacy , life_expectancy , mortality and others -- are improving . On average , those are much better than they were in the developing world 40 years ago , &quot; Sewell said . &quot; But that ' s like the man with his head in the oven and his foot in the icebox . The average temperature doesn ' t tell the story. &quot; Researcher Pat Welch in The Times Washington bureau contributed to this article .
