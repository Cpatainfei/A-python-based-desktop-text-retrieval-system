   <HEADLINE> O.C. ENTERPRISE : CLEANING_UP ON NATURAL_GAS CARS ; HUNTINGTON BEACH AUTO SHOP FINDS A LUCRATIVE NICHE CONVERTING VEHICLES TO RUN_ON THE LOWER-EMISSIONS FUEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A walk_around the Eikelberger shop is like strolling through the past and future of the automobile . The past is represented by a black and burgundy 1938 Ford pickup_truck awaiting delivery to a customer , or the rare 1951 Chrysler-powered Allard JTX roadster being restored . The future is tucked_away at the far end of the shop , where Bryce Eikelberger is drilling mounting holes under the hood of a new white Ford F-series pickup . It is there that the Eikelbergers convert cars and trucks to run_on natural_gas , an alternative fuel that delivers nearly the same performance as gasoline at lower cost and with far lower emissions . Alternative Fuel Technologies in Huntington Beach is one of a handful of conversion shops around Southern California . The company grossed $ 1.8 million last year converting about 365 vehicles to run_on either gasoline or natural_gas . Despite competitive bidding , the company said its profit_margins are respectable because of the special expertise required . Bruce Eikelberger , Bryce ' s dad and the shop ' s founder , says the conversion business is being threatened by new rules from the state Air Resources Board . To keep afloat , he said he is ready to branch_out his company into other kinds of business -- or move_out of state . &quot; We ' re looking_at offshore things and flat getting_out of state . There are other states that don ' t have these problems , &quot; he said . For now , though , Alternate Fuel Technologies has been making a good business from the alternative fuels craze . Parked in his shop is a Federal Express delivery_van , one of several he is converting , and a white Ford pickup , being converted for the city of San Gabriel . He said other customers have been Southern California Gas , the governments of San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties and the South Coast Management District . But the biggest customer has been the city of Long_Beach , for whom AFT has converted about 250 vehicles -- from police_cars to garbage_trucks . Municipalities and fleet operators have been enticed to undertake the $ 4 # 000 vehicle conversions because there are various grants and incentives available , all_in the name of clean air . The gas_company alone offers an incentive of $ 1 # 700 per converted vehicle . &quot; We want to clean_up the air , &quot; said Mike Marelli , natural_gas vehicle sales manager for the Southern California Gas , which itself has 60 vehicles operating_on the fuel it sells and another 140 on order . Alternate Fuel Technologies is one of seven recommended converters in the area , he said , adding : &quot; They do_good work. &quot; Bruce Eikelberger said that the conversion business was a natural for the company . He built his life around cars , first as a mechanic and engineer in a top racing shop in the 1960s and later on_his_own as a vehicle customizer . And early on , he discovered the appeal of alternative fuels . In the 1970s , he converted a van to run_on propane . When a gasoline shortage hit in the latter part of the decade , Eikelberger recalls driving by the gas_lines . As a result , he developed a small business around propane conversions -- although it was dwarfed by the larger business of converting vans to four-wheel drive . In 1990 , natural_gas became more widespread as an alternative vehicle fuel . Government_agencies , the gas_company and fleet operators started installing refueling stations around the Los Angeles Basin as a way of fighting air_pollution . Besides the obvious benefit of cleaner air , natural_gas is also cheaper than gasoline , he said . The amount of gas that is equivalent in energy content to a gallon of gasoline would cost about 75 cents . It also burns so cleanly that engines last longer , according to Eikelberger . He said his propane-powered 1979 Dodge van has similar properties to natural_gas -- and has run 400 # 000 miles without an engine rebuild . But natural_gas fuel tanks are bulky . A tank that could hold 35 liquid gallons has only the equivalent storage_space for five gallons of gasoline . Engines running_on natural_gas have a little less pick_up and speed as gasoline burners . And there is still a limited number of refueling sites . Eikelberger said he has tried to counter the disadvantages . Tanks are usually installed in car trunks or in the beds of pickup_trucks where they do no interfere with interior space . The vehicles are configured so that they can run either on gasoline or natural_gas with the flip of a switch -- so the driver is never stranded . In the case of Long_Beach ' s natural gas-powered police_cars , Eikelberger said the engine automatically switches to gasoline for extra performance when the driver stomps on the pedal , such_as would be the case when becoming involved in a high-speed chase . There are no switches to change between fuel tanks . &quot; Police_departments are a hard_sell so we make_it the most user-friendly thing we possibly can , &quot; he said . &quot; The cop doesn ' t touch a thing. &quot; Long_Beach has converted 250 vehicles , about halfway to its goal of 500 , said Ralph Crouch , the city ' s general supervisor of acquisition . He said Alternate Fuel Technologies has lived_up_to the terms of its contract and &quot; I haven ' t had a problem &quot; with their work . Alternate Fuel Technologies once had 12 employees , but Eikelberger said he had to lay off six at the end of last year . He blames the layoffs on the new rules issued by the state Air Resources Board . The rules say that companies must test their natural_gas conversion equipment on every type of engine set for installation for at least 100 # 000 miles before it can be certified for use , the same types of tests that are required now of gasoline_engines . Such tests are so expensive and the market so limited at present , Eikelberger said , that equipment makers are not willing to make many of the tests . Without equipment that has been tested , vehicles can ' t be converted to natural_gas . &quot; The ARB , with its arrogant attitude , has pushed a lot of industry out of California and are putting a lot of conversion houses out of business , &quot; he said . An Air Resources Board spokesman could not be reached for comment . Alternate Fuel Technologies may be the next to go . Now 52 , Bruce said he is nearing retirement and is considering moving the business to New Mexico . He would pass_on the operations to Bryce , 31 . It would certainly keep things in the family . Bryce is the only one of his four sons who has shown a major interest in the vehicle conversion business and Bruce Eikelberger ' s wife -- Bea Dallas , the company president -- handles the paperwork . If the conversion business gives_out , he said , they can always concentrate_on the another automotive specialty -- such_as restoring old cars or finding other kinds of custom work , such_as building a car that is designed to break speed records for natural gas-powered vehicles , which is under construction in the shop . Being flexible is how the business has survived for 14 years at its present Huntington Beach site . &quot; This is a niche business . We climb into a niche until it gets crowded , then we look_for a new one , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
