   <HEADLINE> AS REFORM FALTERS , U.S. MAY SHIFT FOCUS TO EX-SOVIET STATES ; RUSSIA : DEPARTURE OF REFORMERS FROM CABINET IS VIEWED AS SERIOUS . TREASURY_SECRETARY BENTSEN ENCOURAGES MOSCOW TO STAY THE COURSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States may turn its attention away from Russia and more toward other former Soviet republics , senior U.S. officials said Sunday as they expressed discouragement over the departure of economic reformers from the new Cabinet of Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . Such a shift would make Yeltsin ' s task of redrawing the Russian economy into a free-market system more difficult after 70 years of Communist rule , but it would underscore how seriously the United States views the realignment taking_place in Moscow . The officials , traveling with Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on his return from a 12-day visit to Russia and Asia , had been notably upbeat as they left Moscow eight days earlier at the end of President Clinton ' s meetings with Yeltsin . But the departures of Deputy Prime_Minister Yegor T . Gaidar and Finance_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov have left them deeply disappointed and uncertain about the course that Yeltsin ' s government will follow . The shake-up occurred after nationalists and others seeking to slow_down , or reverse , the redesign of the Russian economic_system strengthened their hands after parliamentary elections Dec . 12 . In a written statement issued Saturday night , Bentsen encouraged Russia to remain on the reform course . &quot; Russia ' s economic future depends_on the vigor with which it implements President Yeltsin ' s commitment to reform , &quot; he said . &quot; I am troubled by some of the indications we are getting_out of Russia . There is no way to have a healthy economy without controlling inflation , and no way to slow inflation without controlling budget_deficits and credit growth. &quot; The statement goes_to the heart of the differences over the course that Russia should take : The United States and others advocating &quot; shock_therapy &quot; are pressing Yeltsin to rein_in those who would continue pumping out rubles to support failing , inefficient industries unable to survive without costly government support that is fueling inflation . Bentsen pointed_out in his statement that the support offered to Russia by the international financial_institutions &quot; will depend_on Russia taking credible measures to reduce inflation. &quot; In Moscow , there were signs_over the weekend that the message is getting_through . Russian Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , who shaped the new Cabinet , met Saturday with Fyodorov and urged him to stay as finance_minister . Fyodorov continued to insist on greater_power to block inflationary government spending -- a condition Chernomyrdin has refused -- and said he would press his cause in a meeting with Yeltsin this week . As his spokesman rejected &quot; the mechanical transfer of Western economic methods to Russian soil , &quot; Chernomyrdin also telephoned Russia ' s representative at the International Monetary Fund in Washington to press for an IMF mission to Moscow soon . Russia is counting_on the IMF and the World_Bank for loans and grants . The United States is committed to a two-year aid program valued at $ 4.1 billion . But any slackening in the plan to bring_down inflation and impose strict standards on the economy to keep the privatization program on course will cause the IMF to retreat , a senior U.S. official said . &quot; Chernomyrdin is in a panic , &quot; said Swedish economist Anders Aslund , who resigned Friday as an adviser to the Russian government . &quot; He realizes that all this Western money may dry_up &quot; unless reformers stay . Another likely result of the reformers ' departure , an official traveling with Bentsen said , would be a new attention on the former republics , which have complained that they are getting short_shrift and are concerned that Russia will get too strong . Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux in Moscow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
