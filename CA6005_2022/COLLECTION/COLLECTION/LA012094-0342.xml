   <HEADLINE> BENTSEN CAUTIONS CHINA ON RIGHTS ; DIPLOMACY : TREASURY_SECRETARY TELLS BEIJING TRADE STATUS HANGS IN BALANCE . BUT HE ADDS THAT ITS HUMAN_RIGHTS RECORD IS IMPROVED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told China ' s senior leadership Wednesday that while Beijing has improved its human_rights record , the progress is still insufficient . But that message , suggesting that China cannot yet count_on renewal of its favorable trade benefits , was countered early today by a Treasury official who said that some progress is being made in negotiations . The official said the Administration is optimistic that agreement on the sensitive issue of prison labor can be reached before Bentsen leaves Beijing on Friday . That issue is once again coming_to a head in the cyclical relationship between China and the United States , particularly in the area of human_rights , because President Clinton must decide by July 3 whether to continue preferential trade treatment . Under an executive order he issued last May 28 , Clinton said the renewal will not be granted in 1994 unless China complies with a 2-year-old agreement with the United States limiting the export of products made by prisoners and allows freer emigration , particularly of dissidents and their families . Under the Clinton order , China must also make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights and meet a number of conditions . It must release political and religious prisoners , treat other prisoners humanely , permit international radio and television broadcasts to reach the country and protect &quot; Tibet ' s distinctive religious and cultural heritage &quot; in the wake of Chinese repression there . &quot; What we ' re looking_for is concrete progress . Some of that has been made , &quot; Bentsen said at a news_conference after meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng and with Finance_Minister Liu Zhongli . &quot; We expect and anticipate more. &quot; Bentsen appeared to go_out of his way to give a nod to the progress China has made in reducing its infant_mortality_rate and educating its people . Some within the Administration have argued that these developments should also be considered in the trade decision . At the heart of current talks , officials said , is an effort to gain access to prisons suspected of being work_camps where a variety of export goods , including diesel_engines , socks , sheepskin and leather , are manufactured or processed . U.S. Customs Commissioner George J . Weise told Congress in September that only one of five requests to inspect such sites had been granted , in violation of a U.S.-Chinese accord reached in 1992 . A Treasury official said the Administration is negotiating over how many sites can be visited , as well as over additional steps to ensure compliance with the 1992 agreement . Importing the products of prison labor is a violation of U.S. law . But other issues remain , and it was unclear whether resolution of the prison question would itself guarantee for China the preferential trade status . The focus_on human_rights during Bentsen ' s four-day visit to China masks key economic goals . A senior Treasury official said Bentsen is pressing China to allow such U.S. financial service operators as banks and investment_companies to conduct business freely , and he wants enforcement of rules against copyright violations . Bentsen is also urging China to move ahead with economic reform , with U.S. assistance . The prominence of the human_rights issue on a visit by the Clinton_Administration ' s chief economic spokesman reflects the melding of politics , diplomacy and economics that is occurring in the post-Cold War world . And the_matter was given added weight because it was presented not by a State_Department official but by a senior Cabinet member whose brief does not normally encompass such issues . Some have argued that human_rights and economic matters , particularly trade issues , should be kept_apart -- or that economic_growth will lead to improved living standards and a more relaxed political atmosphere that will bring limits on repression . The Administration , with some dissent from senior officials , has persisted_in linking the two . China has been host in recent weeks to a series of U.S. political figures , whose approaches to the human_rights issue reflect the divisions of opinion over it back home . Sen . J . Bennett Johnston ( D-La. ) said on a visit here two weeks ago that it would be &quot; unthinkable &quot; for the United States to remove China from the list of countries given &quot; most favored nation &quot; status , which makes their U.S.-bound exports taxable at the lowest levels . House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) arrived shortly afterward , representing those closely linking adherence to universal human_rights standards with renewal of the preferred trade status . And in recent days , former President George_Bush , who repeatedly resisted congressional attempts to force him to take a harder line toward Beijing , was also here , renewing his longstanding friendship with China ' s officialdom . The flurry of interest in human_rights problems here demonstrates the cycle of political attention paid to the subject and to the flow of U.S.-Chinese relations , as well as a realization within the Administration that it ignored China during the first_half of 1993 and that it needs to develop its policy options . The relationship soured last summer shortly after the conditional one-year trade status extension was granted , but it has been improving in recent weeks -- a textile dispute was just settled -- and is being capped with the first visit by a Cabinet member of Bentsen ' s status during the Clinton_Administration . Bentsen said in his news_conference that he emphasized to the Chinese leadership that U.S. concerns over human_rights reflect the thinking of the American people , the President and the Congress . A senior Treasury official said later that the secretary reminded his hosts that he served 22 years in Congress -- he was a senator from Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance_Committee when Clinton picked him for the Treasury post -- and consulted with members of Congress before making the trip . The message was this : China should not hold_out hope that the Administration is isolated on this issue , or that it lacks the will to resist Johnston and other influential members of Congress who seek increased trade with China and who cite examples of progress in arguing for a more relaxed approach . Among the examples was one cited by Bentsen : the release from prison of two Tibetans , including a tour guide who had frequent contact with Westerners who criticized Beijing . Premier Li was said by the Treasury aide to have replied that he understands the role of Congress but that it is the executive_branch that will make the decision -- suggesting that the secretary ' s message had not immediately taken_hold or was being ignored . In its account of Bentsen ' s meeting with Li , the official New China News_Agency hinted that Beijing may be ready to make concessions , saying that Li said the two nations should take &quot; practical steps &quot; to put the relationship on a more normal footing . Similarly , the Chinese account said , Li called_for emphasizing the points of agreement while putting aside &quot; differences in ideologies and concepts of_values , &quot; code words for human_rights . Li also dangled in front of Bentsen the prospect of opening to U.S. exports the vast Chinese nation , with 1.2 billion people -- &quot; a huge potential market ( that ) takes interest in American technology and equipment , &quot; the news_agency said .
