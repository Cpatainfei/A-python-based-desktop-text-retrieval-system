   <HEADLINE> EX-ADVERSARIES IN COLD_WAR START JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES ; EUROPE : U.S. TROOPS JOIN SOLDIERS FROM 12 NATIONS ON THE CONTINENT FOR MANEUVERS IN WESTERN POLAND . RUSSIA IS CONSPICUOUS BY ITS ABSENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Soldiers from the United States and 12 European_countries on both sides of the former East-West divide met on a remote training field here Monday , opening what military_leaders called a historic era in post-Cold War cooperation . Onetime enemies from NATO and the now-defunct Warsaw Pact stood shoulder to shoulder for the first time on the soil of a former East Bloc nation in the first of several military exercises to be held this year under the Atlantic Alliance ' s new Partnership for Peace program . &quot; I never thought I would be in Poland with NATO except to fight the Russians , &quot; said German army Capt . Lothar Pfenning , who grinned in disbelief as military_bands blasted the national_anthems of the 13 armies in this tiny town near Poznan in western Poland . No Russian troops took_part in the military maneuvers , but NATO officials said they were absent only because Russia joined the Partnership for Peace program after invitations to the event had been extended . Russian army Lt . Col . Alexander Strelsky , who attended as an observer , said his country did not participate because it recently hosted bilateral training maneuvers with the United States . &quot; You can ' t do everything at one time , &quot; Strelsky said . But the Russian absence was conspicuous , as was Strelsky ' s refusal to answer questions about the political dimensions of the maneuvers . Russia has made no secret of the discomfort it feels about NATO courting its former East Bloc client states . It is particularly sensitive about military activity in Poland , which historically has served as a buffer between Russia and Germany . Poland , one of the most eager NATO aspirants , has been equally insistent that Russia not be allowed to interfere with its integration into Western institutions , including NATO . &quot; Poland participated in World_War_II along with the Allied forces as a winner but , because of the political solution that came_after the war , fell_under the influence of the Soviet_Union , &quot; said Polish Prime_Minister Waldemar Pawlak . &quot; These military exercises taking_place 50 years after the end of World_War_II bring a new dimension to European cooperation. &quot; In opening the five-day exercises , U.S. Gen . George A . Joulwan , NATO ' s supreme Allied commander in Europe , said the meeting of Eastern and Western forces marked a new chapter in European history . Joulwan said the once-hostile armies should start acting_as &quot; the vanguard &quot; of a peaceful Continent &quot; from the Atlantic to the Urals , &quot; language clearly intended to comfort the Russians . &quot; Five years ago , we traced each other across an Iron_Curtain as adversaries , &quot; Joulwan said . &quot; Today we come_together to train as partners and friends , dedicated to building a Europe whole and free , democratic and at peace. &quot; Poland and other East European_countries view the weeklong exercises as an important step toward eventual NATO membership , even though NATO has offered no such assurances . The meeting was originally intended as a bilateral Polish-American maneuver but was expanded to include NATO and the Partnership for Peace countries at the urging of the Poles , who wanted the distinction of being the first country to host such an event . NATO , meanwhile , was eager to show_off its popularity among its former enemies , especially on the territory of one of them . &quot; We wanted to make_sure the first exercise was in Eastern Europe so it didn ' t look_like NATO was spoon-feeding the Partnership for Peace program to the Eastern countries , &quot; said one NATO official who asked not to be identified . &quot; This way it is a politically significant event. &quot; Indeed , although billed as a military exercise , the assembly of 920 soldiers from six NATO and seven former Warsaw Pact countries was mostly a political event played_out before hundreds of journalists and political_leaders from Poland and across Europe . Organizers interrupted maneuvers for television_cameras and on-the-spot interviews , although the public relations extravaganza got sticky several times when rifle-toting soldiers mistook media convoys for military decoys and ordered them off the road . The exercise included no mock battles , concentrating instead on peacekeeping activities envisioned under the Partnership for Peace program . NATO foreign_ministers endorsed it in January as a way to integrate former Eastern adversaries and nonaligned European_countries into NATO peacekeeping operations , with the possibility of other cooperation . Twenty-two countries have signed partnership agreements . In the course of the week , soldiers will sightsee in Poznan , attend rock_concerts , lift weights , go_to church and compete in sports events , but they will participate in only one battle exercise : a shooting contest at a firing_range . &quot; It is mostly a dog-and-pony show , &quot; said U.S. Army Staff Sgt . Robert Fox . &quot; This is very low-stress compared to the way we normally train. &quot; But Fox and other soldiers -- from the United States , Britain , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Denmark , Italy , Germany , Lithuania , the_Netherlands , Poland , Romania , Slovakia and Ukraine -- said the exercises had already given them a chance to meet other soldiers in a noncombat environment . Many said they had made_good friends among armies on the other side of the former Cold_War divide , exchanging gifts and drinking beer into the late evening . &quot; We are soldiers here and not politicians , and that makes_it easy , &quot; said Bulgarian army Maj . Angel Dimitrov . &quot; The last person who wants to go_to_war is a soldier. &quot;</TEXT>
