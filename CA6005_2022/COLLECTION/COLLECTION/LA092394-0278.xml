   <HEADLINE> TOUGH SETUP ; SHAPING A YOUNG VENTURA VOLLEYBALL TEAM THE CHALLENGE FOR EX-OLYMPIAN MCFADDEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Miki McFadden hopped off the exercise bicycle , lay on her back on the floor and lifted her legs straight up against a wall . &quot; A bodybuilder told me a long_time ago that this is good to get the circulation flowing back to the head , &quot; said McFadden , her shirt drenched with perspiration . &quot; I didn ' t believe him at first , but it works. &quot; Now , McFadden must find the way to unravel another mystery , like how to mold a young and inexperienced women ' s volleyball team at Ventura College into a competitive unit . It won ' t be an easy assignment for the former setter on the U.S. Olympic team in her first season at Ventura . The Pirates have only two returning players from a team that was 13-8 ( 13-5 in Western State Conference play ) in 1993 , and the freshmen need considerable refinement . Still , McFadden says she is up_to the task . &quot; It ' s going_to be tough but I ' m pretty patient , &quot; McFadden said . &quot; I really enjoy seeing ( the players ) get better. &quot; Once , when women ' s volleyball was taking its first serious steps_in the United States , it was McFadden who captured the looks of coaches and peers alike . She was born and raised in Honolulu , Hawaii , and became an outstanding outside hitter at Punahu High in her hometown . Later , McFadden played_at USC , although college volleyball was only a club sport then . But Southern California was already the volleyball mecca in this country and a breeding ground for the national team , and McFadden wanted a shot at playing in the Olympics . McFadden got her wish and made the American team in 1966 after a U.S. Volleyball Assn . tournament that doubled as a tryout . &quot; For me , playing in college was fun but it was real low-keyed , &quot; McFadden said . &quot; But the national team was serious. &quot; In 1967 , the United States won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg , Canada , but McFadden skipped the competition to marry Dan McFadden , a former basketball_player at Yale . They later divorced but have two sons , Danny , a freshman infielder at El Camino College , and Kevin , a high_school soccer player who lives with his father in New Jersey . In 1968 , McFadden was a setter on the U.S. squad that finished eighth at the politically charged Olympics in Mexico_City . That was the year Mexican troops opened_fire on several thousand unarmed students who were staging a rally at a plaza 10 days before the Games started . It was also the year American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos created an uproar with their Black Power salute at the medal ceremonies for the men ' s 200 meters . McFadden remembers the events distinctly . &quot; I got_to be very good friends with those guys , especially John Carlos , &quot; McFadden said . &quot; A group of us went_out to dinner the night before ( the incident ) . They were in a lot of turmoil and had a lot of feelings . They said they were going_to do something but didn ' t say what . &quot; I watched them from the stands and I remember thinking , ' What are they doing ? ' We never thought_of it being a real big deal. &quot; McFadden remained with the American team through a sixth-place finish at the 1971 Pan American Games in Cali , Colombia , but retired before the 1972 Olympics in Munich because of tendinitis in the knees . Still , McFadden spent several days in Munich , where 11 Israeli athletes were murdered -- two in the Olympic Village -- by Palestinian terrorists . Those were also the Olympics of glory for Mark Spitz and his seven gold medals in swimming and of despair for American sprinters Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson , who missed their quarterfinal heats in the 100 meters because of a schedule snafu . &quot; John Carlos got me a pass to the Olympic Village and I was there the day before the shootings . I was at the airport the day it happened , &quot; McFadden said . &quot; Later , when I got home , I opened LIFE magazine and saw myself in a picture , sitting behind Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson in the stands . Those were a lot of exciting times. &quot; After a hiatus to have her sons , McFadden became a teacher and volleyball coach at Punahu in the early ' 80s and then at El Segundo High from 1986 until last year . She was given the Ventura job when Sharon McAlexander , a friend and former foe from UCLA , resigned after last season and recommended McFadden . The Pirates were successful under McAlexander -- two WSC titles in four seasons -- and McFadden is hoping to keep that tradition alive .</TEXT>
