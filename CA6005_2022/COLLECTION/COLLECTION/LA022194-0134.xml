   <HEADLINE> ASTEROIDS , ICE KEYS TO NEW LIFE THEORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All life on Earth may owe its origin to fire and ice , as a rain of immense meteorites shattered the thick ice sheathing a primordial ocean more_than 4 billion years ago , according to a new theory presented by scientists Sunday . In a sharp departure from the conventional scientific view of how life began , several leading authorities told the American Assn . for the Advancement of Science that such cataclysmic impacts may have intermittently melted frozen oceans and triggered in their depths a cascade of chemical_reactions that spontaneously created the elemental building_blocks of life . Redolent with religious and philosophical implications , the origin of life is the fundamental mystery of organic_chemistry . By what process were the molecules that led to living things first assembled ? The new theory was developed by Jeffrey Bada , a respected authority on marine chemistry at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , and Stanley Miller , the UC San Diego chemistry expert who first demonstrated in the laboratory how all_the elements needed for life could spontaneously combine to create the amino_acids , simple sugars and DNA bases that are necessary for life . To frame their theories about the beginning of life , scientists only have the rules of chemistry and informed speculation about the state of the early Earth . There are no fossils or direct geological or astronomical evidence to guide them as they try to understand chemical_reactions that took_place when the Earth was barren and the sun was a fainter , cooler star . Some scientists have suggested that primeval lightning may have sparked the crucial chain_reaction in an atmosphere rich_in ammonia and methane -- just like the famous experiment Miller carried_out in 1953 , but on a planetary scale . Other experts have proposed that comets or cosmic_dust might have carried the seeds of life to Earth . Still others argue that the sun was so faint in its youth that the Earth must have been a frozen ball -- unless it was warmed by a &quot; greenhouse &quot; atmosphere rich_in carbon_dioxide . That , however , would have smothered any organic chemical_reaction . The new theory is an effort to reconcile those contradictions , along with the requirements of organic_chemistry and what planetary scientists have determined about the violent conditions on primitive Earth 4 billion years ago . The result is a plausible explanation of how , under a devastating celestial bombardment , life began over and over and over again . &quot; There is no evidence that the origin of life took_place only once . The origin of life may have taken_place several times , and several times it may have been annihilated by impacts , &quot; said Bada , who presented the new theory Sunday at the annual conference of the nation ' s oldest and largest organization of scientists . The presentation drew a packed auditorium of planetary scientists and chemists in large part because of Miller ' s stature as a leader of such theorizing for four decades . Bada and Miller believe that the organic molecules that serve as seeds of life arose at the bottom of ancient oceans crusted with ice 1 # 000 feet thick . At that time , the sun was so faint that the temperature at Earth ' s surface never rose higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit below zero , according to planetary scientists . The ice would have served as a blanket to keep most of the ocean warm and fluid . Scientists believe those ancient oceans could have been more_than two miles deep . &quot; You have a very frozen planet . Most of the ocean was still unfrozen , &quot; Bada said . &quot; And this is where I think you could have some pretty interesting organic chemistry. &quot; Battered by the fiery impacts of asteroids greater than 50 miles in diameter , the ice would have thawed and refrozen repeatedly , perhaps as often as every 100 # 000 years . &quot; Impacts could periodically melt this frozen planet , &quot; Bada said . Under the new theory , any organic material would have been trapped beneath the ice when the oceans refroze , preventing the raw_material for organic molecules from being destroyed in the atmosphere . Thus -- in that rich , protected stew -- the first self-replicating molecules could have come_into being , Miller and Bada said . Subsequent impacts could have easily annihilated those precursors to life , the scientists suggested , just as a large meteor impact is widely believed to have caused the demise of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago . &quot; The Earth ' s surface was being traumatized by impacts , &quot; said David Stevenson , a professor of planetary sciences at Caltech . &quot; Along would come an impact and blast the hell out of an area and destroy early life . Life may have started several times over . &quot; So perhaps we should ask not when life began , but when did life persist ? &quot; he said . Stevenson , like Miller and Bada , said he was skeptical of the theory that comets or meteorites might have seeded Earth with the building_blocks of life . Although it is well-known that meteorites and cosmic_dust can contain some amino_acids , there is no evidence that enough survived impact to fertilize the planet . Efforts to find traces of extraterrestrial amino_acids in Antarctica and Greenland , where they might have been preserved in pristine ice , turned_up only one sample that shows any trace of organic_compounds from outer space . That trace , from ice that formed more_than 4 # 000 years ago , is so faint that scientists believe it is proof that &quot; cosmic rain &quot; could not have served as the source for the chemical_reactions that led to life . &quot; The amounts are pitifully small , &quot; Bada said . &quot; It is a pretty dilute soup to do any kind of organic chemistry. &quot; However the process was triggered , life on Earth began in &quot; a geological instant , &quot; the scientists said Sunday . But their notion of an instant does not quite match that of most people . &quot; We have been adding_up the time it might take_for life to develop , &quot; Miller said . &quot; The whole process could take_place in 10 million years or less. &quot;</TEXT>
