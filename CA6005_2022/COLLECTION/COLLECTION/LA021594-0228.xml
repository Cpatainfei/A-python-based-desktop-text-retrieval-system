   <HEADLINE> BACK_UP BOSNIA THREAT , U.S. ENVOY TELLS U.N.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trumpeting the new resolve of the Clinton_Administration , U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the U.N. Security_Council on Monday that diplomacy will not stop the slaughter in Sarajevo or the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina unless it is &quot; backed by a willingness to use force. &quot; In a speech to the council during an unusual public session , the American ambassador also added a new warning to the Bosnian Serbs : that they will face retribution if they attempt to harm foreign relief workers in retaliation for any North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air_raids . &quot; The United States will advocate strong action by this council if the Bosnian Serbs follow_through on their threats to restrict the movement of international relief workers , &quot; she said . As more_than 40 ambassadors filled the council_chamber with rhetoric railing against the savagery in Bosnia , both President Clinton and the United Nations denied reports that the international_organization intends to ease NATO ' s demand that the Serbs -- under threat of air strikes -- withdraw all heavy_weapons from the Sarajevo area or turn them over to the United Nations by next Monday . News_reports had indicated that some U.N. peacekeeping officers would be satisfied if the Serbs simply left their artillery batteries in place for distant U.N. monitoring by radar . &quot; I expect that the terms of the NATO agreement will be followed , &quot; Clinton told a news_conference . &quot; Keep_in mind , the secretary_general of the United Nations asked us to take action . We agreed to take action . . . . And we were assured all along the way that our allies in NATO and . . . the secretary_general agreed . So , I don ' t believe there is a fundamental misunderstanding on that point. &quot; Joe Sills , spokesman for Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , said in a news briefing at U.N. headquarters that &quot; there is no difference in the goals being pursued by the U.N. and NATO. &quot; That seemed underscored in Sarajevo , where Lt . Gen . Michael Rose of Britain , commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia , said that &quot; the total exclusion zone for heavy_weapons around Sarajevo will be implemented &quot; before the end of the week and that &quot; any heavy_weapons there will be either under U.N. control or subject of an air attack. &quot; The Serbs , however , were a long way from turning_over their weapons . Two artillery pieces were handed to peacekeepers Monday , bringing the total under U.N. control to 28 . Some analysts estimate that the Serbs have more_than 500 heavy_weapons around Sarajevo . U.S. officials said in Washington that the few pieces of artillery and other heavy_weapons that the Serbs had turned_in during the previous 24 hours were &quot; not significant. &quot; &quot; Most of what they were turning_in was old , not serviceable , &quot; one said . &quot; All we ' ve really deprived them of is spare parts. &quot; Meanwhile , Charles Redman , special U.S. envoy to the Bosnia peace talks in Geneva , met with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo at the start of a two-day visit . It is assumed that Redman is trying to explore all facets of Bosnia ' s bargaining position at the negotiations . The Clinton_Administration , while calling_for air strikes in Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to withdraw or neutralize their heavy_weapons , has promised its European allies , in a change of policy , to take an active part in the peace negotiations . In a related development , the German government announced the arrest in Munich of 38-year-old Dusko Tadic , a Bosnian Serb prison_guard accused of torturing and murdering Muslims in Bosnian detention camps . In denouncing the alleged crimes of Tadic and others like him in Bosnia , the German Federal Prosecutor ' s Office said , &quot; Through murder , rape , deportation and the obliteration of whole villages , those responsible are pursuing a goal of decimating the non-Serb populace. &quot; The public_debate in the Security_Council was called_at the request of Bosnia and several nonaligned governments to discuss the situation in the wake of the bloody massacre in a Sarajevo marketplace Feb . 5 . Russian diplomats joined in the request , seeking to discuss their proposal for a U.N. administration in Sarajevo . The council agreed to allow any U.N. member to speak , but it ruled that no resolution would be taken_up at the session . The meeting began with Bosnia ' s U.N. ambassador , Muhamed Sacirbey , hailing the threat of air strikes . &quot; For those who only understand the language of force and the logic of war , &quot; he said , &quot; this step will be the first to counter their aggression and terrorism. &quot; Fears had arisen last week that Russian Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov would use a council meeting to try to eliminate the threat to bomb artillery positions of the Serbs , who are longtime political and cultural allies of Russia . But , in the face of NATO solidarity , the Russians abandoned the maneuver at the end of last week , and Vorontsov told the council that a Russian proposal for a U.N. administration in Sarajevo is a complement to the air strike threat , not a substitute . The Russian position drew praise from both Albright and French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee . &quot; We are happy to state that we share the same position , &quot; Merimee told Vorontsov . In fact , the good feelings expressed in the Security_Council even enveloped the United States and France . The two nations had been jousting over Bosnia policy several weeks ago . But they embraced each other ' s positions after the Sarajevo marketplace massacre enraged the world and persuaded leaders in both countries that something had to be done . British Ambassador David Hannay sounded a central theme of the session when he stressed that , while the threat of air strikes is real , the need for a negotiated settlement is vital . &quot; Delay and procrastination do not , in Bosnia , lead to things getting better , &quot; he said . &quot; They lead to them getting worse. &quot; Times staff writer Art Pine contributed to this report .</TEXT>
