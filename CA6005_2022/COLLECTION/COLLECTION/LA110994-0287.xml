   <HEADLINE> AMY BIEHL ' S KILLERS GO_ON HUNGER_STRIKE ; PROTEST : THE THREE SOUTH_AFRICAN MEN CONVICTED OF MURDERING THE NEWPORT BEACH SCHOLAR AND SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS IN PRISON ARE DEMANDING POLITICAL AMNESTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The three young_men convicted of murdering scholar Amy Biehl of Newport Beach have embarked_on a hunger_strike to demand political amnesty , state radio said Tuesday . Mongezi Manqina , 22 , Mzikhona Nofemela , 19 , and Vusumzi Ntamo , 23 , were each sentenced Oct . 26 to 18 years in prison . Judge Gerald Friedman said they killed Biehl simply because she was white . SABC radio said Tuesday that the three black_men -- all members of the militant Pan Africanist Congress , who are being held_in prisons near Cape_Town -- were demanding that their crime be seen as political . Biehl ' s mother , Linda , said from her Newport Beach home Tuesday that she does not support amnesty for her daughter ' s killers because she does not believe the crime was politically motivated . &quot; When I saw the three accused , I saw the one particularly that thrust the knife up_to the hilt in Amy ' s heart , and he had no remorse . He looked_at us with pride : ' I did this. ' It was not a political crime , &quot; Linda Biehl said . &quot; They didn ' t know Amy as a politician . They didn ' t even know who she was . In Amy ' s case , it was just , ' Hey , let ' s get her ; she ' s white. ' &quot; A 26-year-old Fulbright scholar , Biehl was in South_Africa helping to educate voters . She was set_upon by a mob chanting anti-white slogans on Aug . 25 , 1993 , when she drove black friends home to the impoverished Guguletu township outside Cape_Town . She was bludgeoned and stabbed to death . &quot; They ' re trying to get attention . . . and working_through this , &quot; Linda Biehl said of her daughter ' s killers . If the three men can demonstrate that their crime was politically motivated , admit their guilt and give a full account of their actions , they could qualify for amnesty under a bill now before the South_African Parliament . Biehl ' s mother said when she visited the townships , residents said they shared her belief that her daughter ' s murder was not politically motivated . &quot; Most people we talked to in the townships are not political people ; they are just normal people who do not view it as a political crime , &quot; Linda Biehl said . &quot; These people just saw it as a murder . ( The attackers ) were considered by a lot of people as just sort of hooligans . They were not really respected citizens in the township . The people in these townships want to see these guys punished . They want law and order . &quot; Obviously , they were raised in a system , in a society , where they are termed by most sociologists as the lost generation , but there needs to be some kind of justice system . They cannot just commit lawless acts under the guise of political acts , &quot; she said . Biehl said that although she had been aware that the men could seek amnesty , the news was another blow to the grieving family . &quot; Isn ' t it amazing ? I thought we were almost through_with it , &quot; she said . The family traveled_to South_Africa after their daughter ' s murder , and Biehl said she was given a copy of the amnesty bill during a visit with the country ' s minister of justice . A fourth defendant , a juvenile , still awaits trial in South_Africa . Times staff writer Debbie Kong contributed to this report .</TEXT>
