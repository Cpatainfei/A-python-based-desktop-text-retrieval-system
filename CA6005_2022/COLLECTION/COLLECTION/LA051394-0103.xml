   <HEADLINE> TAKING TIME TO LOOK CLOSELY ; THERE IS A WORLD OF TREASURES AT THE DESERT_TORTOISE NATURAL AREA , BUT YOU NEED PATIENCE TO APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF THE WILD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two hours of hiking across rugged terrain in the morning sun has Chuck Boland complaining about the television generation . People expect instant gratification . That is the point he ' s trying to make . &quot; To enjoy the desert , you have to walk in it and go slowly , &quot; says Boland , a Bureau of Land Management naturalist . &quot; You have to watch . You have to listen. &quot; Patience . It is more_than a virtue at the Desert_Tortoise Natural Area , a federal wildlife preserve outside California City , two hours north of the San Fernando Valley . Patience is the reality of this place . The landscape used to crawl with Xerobates agassizi , a native California tortoise . In 1973 , the BLM set_aside these 40 square_miles in the Mojave_Desert because the biome supported 200 tortoises per square_mile . Today , drought , disease and human encroachment have caused that population to dwindle to some 20 per square_mile . So when visitors arrive , either for the guided tour or to walk a marked path , Boland doesn ' t mind if they search for half a day without so_much as glimpsing a tortoise . &quot; It gives them a sense of what ' s really happening out here , &quot; he says . It also gives them an opportunity -- if they are patient -- to enjoy some of the desert ' s other jewels . That lightness , that dry aromatic odor . . . one could breathe that only on the bright edges of the world , on the great grass plains or the sagebrush desert . . . something soft and wild and free . -- Willa Cather , from &quot; Death Comes for the Archbishop &quot; Another dry winter has scared_away most of the wildflowers . Life in the western Mojave runs its course in subtle grays and greens and browns . This is the land of creosote , with its gnarled branches and small waxy leaves that deflect the sun ' s full strength . The bushes reach to chest-height but not much higher , then die_off at their centers and grow outward . They progress in sturdy fashion , in expanding rings across the desert floor . You must look closer to the ground to find vibrancy . The horsebrush is covered in tiny white wool and the prickles of the stubby cholla cactus shine silver and gold in daylight . Cheesebush leaves smell as strong as Limburger if you rub them between your fingers . &quot; You take what you can get , &quot; says Carol Panlaqui , a member of the Desert_Tortoise Preserve Committee , a nonprofit organization devoted to raising funds for the federal area . &quot; that ' s the way it goes_in the desert . One year is good and the next is not so good. &quot; And this long , low valley wavers in the heat , buttressed by the Sierra_Nevada range to the west and the Rand Mountains east . A hollow wind blows , fluttering the odd , inflated seed pods that hang from the otherwise sparse branches of the paperbag bush . &quot; We called him Tortoise because he taught us , &quot; said the Mock Turtle angrily . -- Lewis Carroll , from &quot; Alice ' s Adventures in Wonderland. &quot; Few humans might venture to this preserve were it not for the prospect of spotting one of the armor-plated creatures . They are land-locked turtles protected by high-domed shells . The Iroquois hold that mankind first found a home on the Giant_Tortoise ' s ever-expanding back . In fact , these creatures grow to roughly the size of a toaster . Sluggish with their elephantine legs , they poke about like short-sighted old_men , eyes blinking . During the summer , tortoises rest in cool burrows . A given creature will dig several burrows in the half-mile area of its home_range . Summer burrows run shallow . Winter burrows , used from October through February , can extend 10 feet down . Only from March through May will the tortoises become truly active , venturing forth in the mid-morning and late afternoon , foraging for wildflowers and drinking from standing pools . &quot; People like them because they are wild and they ' re cute , &quot; Boland suspects . &quot; And they are different-looking. &quot; But the very highway that leads visitors here has proved to be the reptile ' s downfall , says Bob Parker , a wildlife biologist for the BLM . Roads bring road-kill , which attracts ravens . The blackbirds quickly discover that young tortoises have soft shells and tasty meat . Even more dangerous are people who come_to mine and ranch and tear across the land on their motorcycles . And , Boland says , it occasionally becomes faddish to drive to the Mojave and bring_back a pet tortoise . A good number of them are subsequently returned to the desert . They return with urban diseases . The desert_tortoise was placed under the Endangered Species Act in 1990 after the BLM surveyed the tortoise population in all_of its desert areas and found a 50 % decline since the mid-1980s . According to a recent University of Florida study , a chief cause was a mysterious upper respiratory_tract infection . The decrease proved even greater -- as high as 90 % -- at the Desert_Tortoise Natural Area . Boland explains that people are more apt to release pet tortoises at the preserve , and disease spreads quickly . Until the Desert knows That Water grows His Sands suffice But let him once suspect That Caspian Fact Sahara dies . -- Emily Dickinson A black-tailed hare springs from beneath its bush and skitters , rocket-fast , ears pricked_up , across the sand . These sightings occur less frequently now than in past years . Like the tortoise , the hare and other Mojave fauna have suffered from a deadly combination of natural and man-made conditions . Predators such_as kit_foxes and golden_eagles have also dwindled . Of all_the creatures on the high desert , antelope_squirrels remain plentiful . So do lizards , squirming across the sand or remaining absolutely still , blending into rock and sand as they sunbathe . &quot; We have a lot of people who come_out here just to look_at the lizards , &quot; Boland says . &quot; They ' re the prettiest things out here. &quot; The zebra lizard boasts light and dark rings on its tail . Colorful blotches mark the sides of the uda . When sunning , this creature performs spasmodic pushups . The larger whiptail_lizard uses its exaggerated appendage to slither along . Boland warns visitors not to try to catch these reptiles . The energy a lizard expends fleeing from human hands can leave the creature fatally dehydrated . &quot; In the desert , &quot; the naturalist explains , &quot; the line between living and dying is very fine. &quot; Another lesson . People must learn to be respectful , he says , to enjoy from afar . Oh ! that the desert were my dwelling place . -- Lord Byron Humans provide an interesting sight here . Visitors walk in awkward steps with their heads down , whispering , pointing . It is a matter of searching for clues . Animal tracks . The flutter of a cactus_wren . The rattle of a rattlesnake . Countless burrows dot the ground : large ones for tortoises , smaller for squirrels and mice , smaller still for the lizards . A ring of grass and forbs betrays the location of a harvester ant colony . The ants , carrying seeds into their hole and tossing_out the refuse , germinate a circle of land a foot in diameter . And there are scats . Benjamin Altieri and his mother , Lisa , visiting from Berkeley , come_upon hare droppings . The 7-year-old boy has a pet rat at_home and recognizes the green pellets . &quot; We call them turds , &quot; he says . Coyotes leave larger grayish droppings . Owls regurgitate clumps of hair , fur , feathers and bone . Tortoise scats are cigar-shaped and can be used to determine which direction the reptile was traveling . &quot; Nature is neutral . Man has wrested from nature the power to make the world a desert or to make deserts bloom. &quot; -- Adlai Stevenson Turds are fine , but Benjamin wants to see a tortoise . Some mornings , if Boland knows that a school group is scheduled to arrive , he will survey his preserve , checking near burrows , looking_for tortoises so he can bring visitors back later in the day . &quot; They ' re ecstatic when they see a tortoise , &quot; he says . On this morning , hours of searching bring no such ecstasy . that ' s the way it goes_in the desert . Benjamin and his mother must satisfy themselves with examining a stuffed specimen on display in the parking_lot . The BLM has considered increasing its tortoise population by artificial means . Bringing in food , such_as alfalfa hay , has not succeeded at other sites , Parker said . The tortoises became ill . Irrigating to promote wildflower growth during drought years has proved too costly . So the tortoises , given protection from man , are left to rebound on_their_own . And Boland hopes that , in the absence of a tortoise sighting , visitors will take the time to notice what they can see . The cholla and the hare . The uda and the cactus_wren . &quot; that ' s the whole message , &quot; he says . &quot; If I can instill an appreciation for the desert . . . that ' s how you save the desert. &quot; Act to Preserve More of Desert The Senate passed legislation April 14 to preserve 6.3 million more acres of the 25-million-acre California desert , a national treasure that encompasses 90 mountain_ranges , more_than 100 # 000 archeological sites , waterfalls , wetlands and 760 species of wildlife . This action virtually assures that the California Desert Protection Act will become law this year . It will create 74 wilderness areas and three new national_parks , protecting portions of the fragile desert from off-road vehicles , mining exploration and new livestock grazing . The comparatively tiny Desert_Tortoise Natural Area , set_aside by the Bureau of Land Management in 1973 , is located amid these new federal areas but is not a part of them . WHERE TO GO Location : Desert_Tortoise Natural Area , in the Mojave_Desert northeast of California City . Getting there : North on Highway 14 to the California City turnoff . At California City , take Randsburg Mojave Road northeast and follow the signs . ( Last portion of road is unpaved. ) Hours : Open daily . Naturalist on_duty from March through May . Parking is free . Price : Self-guided and guided tours are free . Call : ( 619 ) 384-3707 .</TEXT>
