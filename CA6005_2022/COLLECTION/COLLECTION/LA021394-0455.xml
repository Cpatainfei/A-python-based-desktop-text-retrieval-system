   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; PREPAREDNESS ; IDEA FILE : SEISMIC VETO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How It Works Give earthquake experts veto power over local zoning decisions and construction plans to ensure seismic safety . As part of every zoning request or construction proposal , an earthquake engineer would have to certify that a proposed building or home incorporates all precautions necessary to ensure they can withstand a major earthquake . To make certain that contractors comply , no building would be certified for occupancy until independent earthquake specialists had inspected the actual construction . To ensure that owners of older buildings comply with retrofitting requirements , the earthquake engineers would have authority to close a building or bridge if repairs are not undertaken in a timely way . Benefits The recent Northridge quake underscored the effectiveness of proper engineering when it comes_to avoiding damage or injuries . Experts say that making a building strong enough to withstand most quakes only adds about 10 % to its cost . Although earthquake engineers and scientists often serve as consultants on major projects or advise local governing bodies on building_codes , their advice often is ignored . As memory of a major quake fades , so usually does the zeal with which earthquake regulations are enforced . Short-term or Long-term Impact ? Short-term . Enough is known already about earthquake engineering precautions that stringent enforcement of existing regulations would dramatically enhance safety . Already building_codes are being strengthened as a result of the Northridge quake . As engineering expertise improves and new techniques are developed , however , earthquake experts could ensure they are adopted in new buildings and retrofitted to older structures . With sufficient local political power , scientists could ensure that quake safety is not sacrificed in the name of keeping_down costs or encouraging local development . Supporters Rental tenants , office workers , students tend to back the idea . Opponents Many developers and building owners oppose the idea . Governing bodies may be reluctant to cede such power to non-elected experts . There also is nothing to prevent scientists from being co-opted by real_estate interests or the construction_industry . The Costs Added administrative costs . Higher builing costs . Reality Check Unlikely .</TEXT>
