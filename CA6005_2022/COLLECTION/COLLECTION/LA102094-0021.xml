   <HEADLINE> GARDEN FRESH : PARADISE PRESERVED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Quinces , Aphrodite ' s apples , are at once patrician and earthy . The fruit , golden as the sun , resembles a rumpled pear covered with downy bloom -- the dust of centuries . A ripe quince ' s perfume is a mix of musk and jasmine , lilacs , guavas and apples . The scent from a bowl can fill a room and drive you crazy . How is it that a fruit the ancients revered , a fruit still esteemed around the world , is neglected here ? Probably because the pale flesh of raw quinces is rough and astringent . But poach slices in syrup , stew chunks with honey , brush halves with sweet butter and slowly roast them , and their rosy color and complex perfume will fill your senses . Whether in leaf or winter ' s bareness , the quince tree makes a fine specimen . Limbs are dark and lightly crooked ; fruit dangles * Jonathan Gold and Counter Intelligence are_on vacation . brightly on the bough . Trees grow slowly to 10 feet , but you can keep them at six to seven . And you can grow a tree in a half-barrel . In spring , there are cream-to-blush blossoms the size of a doll ' s teacup . Spring through fall , broad oval leaves are new-green -- in late autumn , they turn pumpkin and flutter to the ground . Don ' t have a place for a tree ? Coax yours into a handsome shrub , perhaps against a wall . * Quinces are self-fruitful and need no pollinizer -- one tree alone makes fruit . Quince has modest chilling requirements , so it ' s that rare pome fruit that thrives in balmy climates . Quinces actually prefer moist , heavy soil -- clay people , rejoice ! An old wives ' tale has it that quinces thrive on neglect . Forget it -- nothing and nobody does ! All they ask_for is sun and a fair amount of water . Happily in Southern California , the trees are little bothered by disease . Should you have a problem , consult a local county agricultural adviser . Now ' s a good time to buy a potted tree and set it in the garden , or ( less expensive ) order bare-root for delivery in spring . Quinces ripen in September and October . Orange quinces are large and roundish , with deep golden flesh that turns the richest red of all when cooked . Pineapple quinces have a hint of pineapple in their white flesh . Less tart than Pineapple , Smyrna has pale-yellow flesh and keeps especially long . Green-gold Champion has delicately flavored flesh . Van Deman , Burbank ' s cross between Orange and Portugal , produces ample spicy fruit . Cook ' s Jumbo has white flesh and is enormous . * Around the turn_of_the_century , quince trees flourished in America ' s gardens and quinces were common in the kitchen . In &quot; The Joy of Cooking &quot; editions of the ' 30s , ' 40s and ' 50s , Irma S . Rombauer had a recipe for a quince liqueur she described as &quot; given by a French priest to his friends. &quot; As a recipe in a book ought , it mirrors the times : Four quarts of ground quinces stirred into three gallons of rye_whiskey . Along with cherry bounce , blackberry cordial and peach brandy , the cleric ' s liqueur was pulled from later editions . Though one quince recipe was ejected , another was added . To me , paradise jelly has only one rival -- the fabulous currant preserve from Bar-le-Duc in northern France . Over the years , as cooks do , I ' ve fiddled_with Rombauer ' s recipe . I use crabapples for their incomparable jelly-making quality , and I add tiny seeds of vanilla_bean . The whiff of vanilla is marvelous , and the specks suspended in the rose jelly are enticing . Sometimes , instead of vanilla , I lay a lemon , rose or nutmeg geranium leaf in the jar before pouring in the jelly . These days you won ' t find many recipes for quince in books , but you can use quinces in any recipe calling_for apples . For example , inspired by Cecil Beaton ' s iced apples in &quot; The Alice B . Toklas Cook Book , &quot; I made a divine dessert by poaching thin slices of fruit -- half-apples / half-quinces -- in lemon-flavored syrup until translucent , chilling them 24 hours in a deep dish , then unmolding them . Their pectin holds the shape and their color is breathtakingly rosy . Serve with custard sauce . Remember to add gratings of quince to compositions of apples or pears -- particularly pies , tarts and puddings . They ' ll turn it rosy . And don ' t forget the exotic uses of fruit with meats -- quinces are superb with lamb and beef . Then look_into chutneys and pickles , liqueurs and cordials , quince wine . . . . * If you ' ve never tasted quince , get yourself to a market with a European , Latino or Middle Eastern clientele and ask_for a tin of Mexican dulce de membrillo , French cotignac or Greek pastokithonia -- or there may be ayva helvasi from Turkey or something from Morocco . This is the quintessence of quince , a sweetened puree slowly cooked down to jellied candy . My husband has made_it , a labor_of_love . But then , it is Aphrodite ' s fruit . * Sources : Fruit -- at the market . Trees -- Cook ' s Jumbo , Orange , Pineapple and Smyrna , bearing age in 5- and 15-gallon containers , at ( or shipped year-round from ) Pacific Tree_Farms , 4301 Lynwood Drive , Chula Vista , Calif . 91910 ; Orange , Smyrna and Van Deman shipped bare-root January through May from Raintree Nursery , 391 Butts Road , Morton , Wash . 98356 ; Champion , Pineapple and Smyrna shipped bare-root January through March from Sonoma Antique Apple Nursery , 4395 Westside Road , Healdsburg , Calif . 95448 . * You must use a good strong knife and a steady hand to cut quinces . The flesh discolors as quickly as apple and pear , so keep pieces in a bowl of water with a splash of lemon_juice . Do not core fruit , as stems and seeds have pectin and will be removed during draining anyway . To waste not one whit of paradise jelly makings , I make paradise jam with the contents of the dripping bags . It ' s homely but delectable . Puree the leftover fruits together , then press them through a fine sieve to retrieve the gritty bits . Combine in a heavy saucepan : four measures puree , three measures sugar , and a small lump of unsalted butter . Stir with a wooden spoon over low heat until thick -- watch so it doesn ' t scorch . A scented geranium leaf in the jar is a fine addition . Pot up and process as you do the jelly . PARADISE JELLY 2 1 / 4 pounds quinces , fuzz rubbed_off 2 pounds crabapples or use juicy , slightly tart apples such_as Gravenstein , McIntosh or Jonathan 1 cup picked-over cranberries Cool water 4 cups sugar 1 vanilla_bean , slit in half lengthwise , seeds scraped out Coarsely chop quinces and crab-apples separately , cutting pieces same size . Separately cook quinces , crab-apples and cranberries in 3 nonreactive saucepans , with water to barely cover each fruit . Bring to boil , turn heat to low and simmer until fruits are soft but not mushy . Overcooking reduces pectin . Line each of 3 strainers with dampened kitchen cloth and set over 3 bowls . Turn_in fruits and let drip . When dripping slows , tie cloths into bags and suspend over bowls to finish dripping overnight . Do not squeeze bags . Combine sugar and vanilla seeds , using back of spoon to separate clumps and mix seeds evenly through sugar . In large , heavy , nonreactive saucepan , combine 2 cups crabapple juice , 1 1 / 2 cups quince juice and 2 / 3 cup cranberry_juice ( reserve excess juice for another jelly ) . Bring to boil_over medium heat and simmer 5 minutes . Skim_off froth . Turn heat to low and mix_in sugar . Stir with wooden spoon , meanwhile washing_down any sugar crystals that form on sides of pan with brush moistened with cold water ( this keeps crystals from forming in jelly later ) . When sugar has dissolved , raise heat until syrup simmers rapidly . Cook without stirring until syrup reaches 222 degrees on candy_thermometer , or until spoonful of syrup , turned_on its side over pan , slides off in sheet , about 12 minutes . Remove from heat and skim_off any foam . Immediately pour into sterilized canning jars , leaving 1 / 4-inch head space . Wipe rims , set_on new lids and screw rings on tightly . Set_in kettle and cover with hot water by 1 inch . Cover , bring_to boil and boil 5 minutes . At high altitude , add 1 minute for every 1 # 000 feet above sea_level . Lift_out jars and set away from draft to cool undisturbed overnight . Check seal ; center of lid should not wobble when pressed . If it does , replace lid and boil jar as before or keep jar refrigerated . Store in cool , dry place . Makes 5 ( 8-ounce ) jars .
