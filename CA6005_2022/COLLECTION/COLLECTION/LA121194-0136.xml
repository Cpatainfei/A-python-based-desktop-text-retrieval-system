   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; JACQUES PARIZEAU ; CREATING A NEW NATION FROM FRENCH QUEBEC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To his admirers , Jacques Parizeau is the avuncular , albeit formal , ex-college professor and economist , focused with brilliant intensity on a nearly 30-year-old dream of making his native province of Quebec a new nation , independent from the rest of Canada . To detractors , he is an arrogant fantasist , dwelling on archaic rivalries between English- and French-speaking Canadians and bent_on breaking_up a country that a recent U.N. study ranked the world ' s most livable . Parizeau , 64 , was elected premier of Quebec on Sept . 12 , on a platform of independence and a promised province-wide referendum on the issue within 10 months . It should have been a moment of undeniable triumph for Parizeau , leader of the Parti Quebecois , which has long advocated separation as the best route for preserving Quebec ' s French language and culture in North_America . Instead , his victory was immediately cast as ambiguous , at best . The Parti Quebecois won only 44.7 % of the popular vote , well below what was forecast . That was good_enough for 77 seats in the 125-member provincial Parliament , only because the opposition was split between two other major parties , the Liberals and the Parti Action Democratique . Meanwhile , polls show support for independence -- or sovereignty as it ' s called here -- dropping to between 32 % and 42 % of the Quebec electorate . The decline troubles some separatists , notably Lucien Bouchard , opposition leader in the Canadian national Parliament and Parizeau ' s sometimes uneasy partner in the movement for Quebec sovereignty . Bouchard has said there shouldn ' t be a referendum until the separatists are sure they can win . ( This interview was conducted before Bouchard ' s recent life-threatening illness. ) If Parizeau is disheartened , however , he does not show it . His only concession to the polls is a slight adjustment in his target date for the referendum -- now slated , he says , for some time in 1995 . As is his custom , he concedes few obstacles to Quebec independence , whether it ' s the large public_debt it would inherit or the concerns of Quebec ' s influential English-speaking minority . Parizeau ' s politics extend into his personal life . A widower with two children , Parizeau , in 1992 , married Lisette Lapointe , an activist in his political_party . Talking recently in his office in the provincial_capital , Parizeau speaks flawless English with a plummy accent -- perhaps influenced by his study at the London School of Economics . He is fond of irony and underlines it with deep laughter , but the dominant impression is of the former professor imparting a lesson . * Question : Most Americans probably see Canada as a success and a good place to live , even with its problems . Their first question to you might be , why do you want to leave it ? Answer : It ' s something that has matured for a long_time , and that ' s why it takes such a democratic form . There is no violence . Everything is concentrated_on the vote . . . . Here you have a lot of people living_in a country that has an excellent reputation abroad , but we just refuse to live with each other . . . . Quebeckers have had a long history on this continent , and they ' ve been shoved , moved , into all sorts of situations within Canada . When the Canadian confederation took_place in 1867 , a lot of people in Quebec said , &quot; Could we have a referendum ? &quot; They said , &quot; Oh , no . In the_British tradition , the Parliament can do anything , excluding changing a man into a woman , and , therefore , no referendum &quot; -- and that was that . We entered confederation . This time around , we ' re nice . We say we ' re going to have a referendum before we get_out . that ' s a remarkable improvement in_relation_to the shoving that we ' ve known in the past . . . . People ( in Quebec ) are rather confident that they can define their own future , and we ' ve come_to the point where we ' re going to define our own future . So it ' s a long , long evolution , with times when it was one step_forward , two steps backward , and times when it was two steps_forward , one step backward . But we ' re coming_to an end . Q : Is it still your intention to have the referendum on independence in 1995 ? A : Yes . Q : The latter part of ' 95 , the early part of ' 95 ? When ? A : On the path of history , who gives_a_damn ? Q : The latest polls show opposition to sovereignty at around 60 % of Quebec voters , and no sovereigntist party or position has ever won a majority vote_in Quebec . Given that , what ' s the source of your optimism that you will win a majority vote for independence ? A : I ' ll put the question the other way around : How do you have an idea as potent as the independence of a country that , in vote after vote , gets between 40 % and 50 % of the votes and say , &quot; I ' m sure it ' ll vanish &quot; ? Some politicians can be more skillful than others and get beyond the 50 % . Others might be less skillful and get below 50 % . I can ' t say , &quot; I ' m a superb tactician and I ' m sure I ' ll get beyond 50 % . &quot; Other people will have to comment on how skillful I am . But it ' s now a question of tactics and strategy . Get me a half-dozen Ontarians who put their feet to the Quebec flag , and I ' ve got_it . . . . Q : How does the United States come_into this equation ? Obviously , you have an interest in keeping the United States neutral and in getting quick U.S. recognition of Quebec if you win a referendum . A : I can ' t and shouldn ' t imagine that the ( Clinton ) Administration would do anything other_than the usual words : &quot; ' We prefer that Canada remain as_a_whole , but the future lies_in the hands of Canadians and Quebeckers. &quot; We ' re happy with this and , by the way , everyone is in Canada , both federalist and separatist . . . . We ' ve been discussing with the State_Department and Commerce and the National Security_Council , &quot; What happens , if . . . . &quot; And it really boils_down to . . . will we be a member of NAFTA ( the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ) ? I think , in relevant circles in the United States , it ' s well known that the trade between Quebec and the United States is 40 % of the trade between the United States and Mexico . There are people in the States who have been discussing the fate of Chile within NAFTA . Trade between Quebec and the United States is nine times -- nine times ! -- the trade between Chile and the United States . Trade been the United States and Quebec is 2 1 / 2 times the trade between the United States and Brazil . So , of course , we will become members of NAFTA . And it ' s quite clear , within the relevant circles in the United States , that the main reason why the free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada came_through , despite considerable opposition within English Canada , was the fact that in Quebec it was a nonpartisan issue . Both parties ( within Quebec ) were , in fact , free_traders . . . . There are going_to be hitches . Some of the negotiators in the United States have never quite stomached the fact that cultural properties were excluded from these agreements . They obviously are going_to try to reopen these talks with Quebec . But we won ' t be without allies , under such circumstances . Our best allies , our strongest allies , will be English Canada . Q : Over the last 20 years , Quebec has become increasingly multicultural . Yet , the roster of Parti Quebecois members in the National Assembly is entirely white and only one member comes from a family that speaks English at_home . Is this a concern to you and , if so , what do you do to improve your credibility with minorities and English speakers ? A : What you say is not entirely historically correct . . . . Mr. ( Joseph ) Facal ( the Parti Quebecois M.P. from Fabre , near Montreal ) does not belong_to a visible minority , but he comes from Uruguay . He was born there . I know Uruguay is not among the so-called minorities , but it just happens he ' s from there . I suppose there are presentable minorities these days and non-presentable minorities or cultural communities . we ' ll never have a great number of them until such time as these cultural minorities split their vote . At the present_time , they ' re all voting Liberal . So be it . But it doesn ' t represent a smear on our reputation . . . . It ' s not that we don ' t try , but until such time as some of these people in the cultural minorities will accept , will take_a_chance , with the Parti Quebecois , we won ' t have many representatives . . . . We always reach_out . We will and we continue . Q : Restrictive language laws have created much controversy here . Some members of your party_favor reimposing the ban on English on outdoor signs . Some also favor extending the requirement that all business be conducted in French to small businesses with as few as 10 employees . Do you anticipate such changes in the law ? A : We want a society that normally functions in French . Undoubtedly , that legislation , to start with , was a shock in our society . But it did help a great_deal to have that thing understood , that we want to operate normally in society in French . One of the essential things here is that businesses operate , at least internally , in French . Externally , if you ' re in contact with markets in the United States , you won ' t start to negotiate in French with St . Louis . But , internally , they should operate in French , as they do_in French in France and as they do_in German in Germany . That is the logical thing to do . Laws help . At one point , laws overkill . And that ' s always a question of judgment . At what point have your laws created enough of the environment that you ' ve accomplished your purpose ? . . . There ' s a great_deal to be done with_respect_to businesses , particularly small business . It ' s not a normal situation where you ask people here if you can ' t speak English , you can ' t have this or that job in a company that has 20 employees . It ' s not a normal situation . So , we ' ll insist , and we ' ll go_on doing that sort of thing , until we think we ' ve reached a normal situation . Q : What do you say to young English speakers who say they don ' t think they can fulfill their potential in Quebec and need to move elsewhere ? A : Well , it ' s probably inevitable as a reaction , and life corrects this as time goes_by . You can imagine being 17 or 18 and saying that sort of stuff , and then you realize that when you become a young parent , you send your kids to the_English school where you went , it ' s still there . And when your wife is_sick , you send her to the ( English-speaking hospital ) and that half the radio_stations in Montreal are English speaking . . . . All these kids are bilingual , the large majority . But they say , are they ( the Parti Quebecois ) going_to suppress our schools ? Will the ( hospitals ) still be there ? Well , the ( hospital ) will be there . Their schools will be there , the Montreal Repertoire Theater will still be there . . . . The constitution of a sovereign Quebec will incorporate all these things . . . . Q : I ' d like to ask a_few economic questions . Some recent analyses suggest that with its provincial debt and its share of Canada ' s national_debt , an independent Quebec would be among the most indebted nations on Earth . A : Oh yes , heavens , because of Canada . Canada is , and because Canada is , we are . They ' re quite right . Q : How would that affect Quebec ' s ability to take_on the additional responsibilities that come_with independence ? A : The additional responsibilities come_with additional tax sources . . . . We want to administer our own taxes . And we can make an effort , once we have shouldered our part of the debt , to try to start to stop that indebtedness . The situation of the federal . . . deficit is much worse than the provincial situation . They ' re in a jam now . . . . Government programs on top of one another , both governments trying to do the same thing with_respect_to the same people . There ' s a huge wastage . There ' s something like at least $ 3 billion of wastage because of that overlapping of federal and provincial programs . . . . Until we ' ve conducted our own studies , and they ' ve just been started , we can ' t be any more specific , but $ 3 billion seems a reasonable explanation . Q : You ' ve said you intend to use Canadian money as Quebec currency should Quebec achieve independence . Isn ' t it a distinct disadvantage for an independent country to turn_over its monetary policy to another nation , as you would be doing ? A : You ' re quite right , but as the judge says , it ' s the balance of inconvenience . We won ' t have anything to say on monetary policy for quite a while , but what else is new ? All we ' re saying , for the present_time , is look , we ' re going to have a go at administering our own taxes , defining our own laws and signing our own treaties . And who knows , as time goes_by , and as people in English Canada recover their smile again , maybe we can talk a little about monetary policy. *</TEXT>
