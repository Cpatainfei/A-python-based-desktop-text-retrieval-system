   <HEADLINE> RELEASE RATE OF CFCS IS SLOWING , RESEARCHERS SAY ; ENVIRONMENT : INTERNATIONAL PACT TO PHASE_OUT OZONE-DEPLETING CHEMICAL ' IS TAKING_EFFECT , ' UCI PROFESSOR SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The increase in concentration of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere has been reduced by half since industrial nations agreed to phase_out manufacture of the ozone-depleting chemical , researchers said Monday . &quot; An international agreement is taking_effect . The countries of the world are actually following it , &quot; said F . Sherwood Rowland of UC Irvine . Despite that good news , experts said chlorofluorocarbons already released into the atmosphere will continue to savage ozone , the natural chemical that protects Earth from the sun ' s harmful radiation . At a symposium at the national meeting of the American Assn . for the Advancement of Science , researchers reported that the chlorofluorocarbons , or CFCs , increased at the rate of 4 % annually through the 1980s , but the rate has now slowed to about 2 % . CFCs are used in refrigeration and industrial processes . They once were used as a propellant in aerosol cans . Researchers discovered in the 1970s that the chemical broke_down into chlorine in the atmosphere and that the chlorine was depleting the ozone_layer . Without ozone , the Earth has no protection from ultraviolet solar rays , a form of radiation that can cause skin_cancer and damage genetic material . In 1987 , industrial nations signed an agreement to phase_out CFCs . That agreement has since been updated twice , with the latest calling_for a ban on most CFCs by 1996 . But Rowland said some CFC molecules already in the atmosphere will take_up to a century to decay . Another researcher , C.R. Booth of Biospherical Instruments , a contractor for the National Science Foundation , said a network of instruments around the world have proven a direct link between the loss of ozone and a sharp increase in ultraviolet_radiation . Booth said instruments in Antarctica , Alaska , South_America and San Diego have all detected increases in ultraviolet_radiation . &quot; There is a strong and very predictable correlation in rises in ultraviolet_light and decreases in ozone , &quot; Booth said . The instruments , which measure ultraviolet_radiation spectra that are damaging to skin and to DNA , detected record levels of ultraviolet in the Antarctic . At Palmer Station , a U.S. facility in Antarctica , instruments recorded in a_few weeks more harmful ultraviolet_radiation than is seen in an entire year in San Diego , Booth said . This is the result of a so-called &quot; ozone_hole &quot; that has been detected over the South Polar region every spring for a number of years . Recent measurements have detected an ozone depletion over the South_Pole of up_to 70 % during some days . Raymond C . Smith , a UC Santa Barbara researcher , is studying the biological effects of the decreased ozone near the South_Pole . He said that beneath the ozone_hole there is a 6 % to 12 % decline in the population of phytoplankton , a microscopic algae that is the foundation of the food_chain in the far southern seas .</TEXT>
