   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : JUSTICE 101 ; A COURTROOM PRIMER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smith , Broderick , Bobbit , and soon , live from Los Angeles , Menendez II and Simpson . A stream of televised , high profile trials over the past few years has brought the courtroom into the living room . Some viewers might grow bored as the cases bog_down in the minutiae of real-world legal procedures . So , let ' s pause for a brief civics lesson , and to consider the thousands of other cases that move through the courts of Los Angeles each year . Even without the glare of publicity , each follows the same tortuous path , often at a snail ' s pace . The wheels of justice turn slowly for a reason . Although each case is different , bringing with it varying factual circumstances and legal issues , every criminal case follows certain steps . A simple case usually takes from six months to a year ; a complex case can take years . This is especially true of murder cases in which the death_penalty is sought . The Simpson case , in comparison , can be said to be moving at the speed_of_light . A Criminal Case Goes To Trial 1 ) FILING or INDICTMENT : Police may arrest someone on suspicion of committing a crime , but only the district_attorney or city attorney can file charges . The district_attorney handles felonies , the city attorney misdemeanors . In some cases , prosecutors use the grand_jury , which has the power to subpoena witnesses . If the grand_jury issues an indictment , the case heads directly to Superior_Court . 2 ) ARRAIGNMENT : The arraignment , or formal reading of the charges , occurs before a Municipal Court judge . The exception is grand_jury cases , which bypass Municipal Court . Suspects must be arraigned within 48 hours of arrest , or within 72 hours if the arrest occurs over the weekend . 3 ) PRELIMINARY HEARING : The hearing is a mini-trial to determine whether the prosecution has brought enough evidence to show that a crime occurred and that the defendant probably committed it . If the Municipal Court judge agrees such evidence exists , the defendant is &quot; bound over &quot; for Superior_Court trial . A defendant is entitled to the hearing within 10 days of arraignment , but it is usually postponed with the defendant ' s consent , known as &quot; waiving time. &quot; 4 ) PLEA NEGOTIATIONS : Some charges are usually dismissed in exchange for the plea to other counts . Prosecutors and defense_attorneys generally agree on the sentence , but their arrangement is not binding on a judge . After the plea , the probation department prepares a background report on the defendant and recommends a sentence . The judge is not bound by that report , either . The sentence can vary on a number of variables , including the seriousness of the crime and the defendant ' s history of past crimes . 5 ) SUPERIOR_COURT : The journey through Superior_Court again begins with an arraignment . A defendant has the right to a trial within 60 days , but most agree to &quot; waive time. &quot; If a defendant pleads guilty or &quot; no contest , &quot; a sentencing date is set . If the plea is not_guilty , the judge will schedule dates to hear various legal motions , usually filed by the defense . The motions can challenge , for example , whether police obtained evidence legally . 6 ) TRIAL : There are two types of trials . A trial by a judge , sitting without a jury , is known as a &quot; bench &quot; or &quot; court &quot; trial . Most defendants opt_for trial by jury . Each lawyer is given a certain number of &quot; preemptory challenges , &quot; which they can use to strike a juror without explanation . After 12 jurors are chosen , two to six alternate jurors are chosen . Trial Issues * BURDEN OF PROOF : Because defendants are presumed innocent , the prosecution has the burden_of_proof and presents its evidence first . If the case continues , the defense may present witnesses . The defendant is under no obligation to testify , and jurors are instructed not to consider it if he doesn ' t . * VERDICT : If the jurors can ' t agree on a verdict , a mistrial is declared and prosecutors will decide whether to retry the case or dismiss the charges . If the defendant is found guilty , a sentencing report is prepared by a probation_officer and the judge imposes sentence , usually within three months after the verdict . The verdict may be appealed . Tough Sentences California ' s state_prison population is about 125 # 319 . More_than a third of them were sentenced in Los Angeles County . As of Aug . 1 , 1994 : Los Angeles County - 37.3 % San Diego County - 8 % Orange County - 4.9 % Santa Barbara County - 4.9 % Sacramento County - 4.2 % Volume of Cases Los Angeles , Orange and Ventura counties account_for a third of all criminal cases and civil lawsuits filed_in California . 1992-93 State Total : 1 # 017 , 798 Los Angeles County : 291 # 203 Orange County : 77 # 136 Ventura County : 21 # 311 Judicial Burden Cases per judge in Los Angeles , Orange and Ventura counties are about the same , but in sprawling Los Angeles County many_more judges share the load . Fiscal 1992 State total Number of Judicial Positions : 928 Number of cases Per Position : 113 * Los Angeles County Number of Judicial Positions : 295 Number of cases Per Position : 161 * Orange County Number of Judicial Positions : 71 Number of cases Per Position : 157 * Ventura County Number of Judicial Positions : 16 Number of cases Per Position : 164 Pleading Guilty Nearly all criminal cases are resolved by guilty pleas . Only a small percentage of cases actually result in trials . Percent pleading guilty : Statewide Total : 79.3 % Los Angeles County : 68.5 % Orange County : 92.1 % Ventura County : 87.5 % * Judge Robert M . Letteau , supervising judge for the Van Nuys branch of the Los Angeles County Superior_Court , says the 23 Van Nuys and 16 San Fernando judges are experimenting with ways to make the cases flow more smoothly . They fill for each other , and some Superior_Court judges have agreed to take felony pleas in Municipal Court , clearing many cases before they can become backlogged . According to Letteau , there are about 65 cases outstanding per judicial position . The two courts have shared space since the San Fernando Courthouse was damaged in the Jan . 17 earthquake . &quot; We ' re getting the work done . I think we ' re processing the cases as efficiently as we can. &quot; -Robert M .
