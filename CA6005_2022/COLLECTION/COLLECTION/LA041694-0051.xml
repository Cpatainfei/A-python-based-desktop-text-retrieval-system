   <HEADLINE> FEDERAL_COURT CLEARS WAY FOR EXECUTION ; CAPITAL_PUNISHMENT : SHARPLY DIVIDED PANEL RULES THAT TRIPLE-MURDERER IN WASHINGTON MAY BE HANGED WITHIN 42 DAYS . APPEAL TO SUPREME COURT IS PLANNED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sharply divided federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Friday that a Washington man may be hanged within 42 days , even though he is entitled to 90 days to file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court . The 6-5 decision came as the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the final appeal of triple-murderer Charles R . Campbell , who has been_on Death Row in Washington state for more_than a decade . He sought further review by all 26 9th Circuit judges , a process that is theoretically possible but never has been carried_out . In February , the 9th Circuit , also by a 6-5 majority , rejected Campbell ' s claim that execution by hanging violates the U.S. Constitution ' s bar against cruel_and_unusual_punishment . After it upholds a death sentence , the 9th Circuit Court usually grants an automatic stay to allow an appeal_to the Supreme Court . However , the court ' s majority said that &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; justified different treatment in this case , noting that the 9th Circuit was criticized by the Supreme Court two years ago for failing to resolve Campbell ' s appeals . &quot; We are under a duty to ensure a prompt resolution of the_matter , &quot; said the majority , led by J . Clifford Wallace , the 9th Circuit ' s chief judge . Appellate Judge Stephen Reinhardt , joined by four colleagues , issued a blistering dissent . &quot; Our decision demonstrates once again that in capital_punishment cases , the current federal judiciary is less concerned with rules_of_law and constitutional principles than with ensuring that defendants are executed speedily , &quot; Reinhardt wrote . &quot; By our decision , we pronounce our willingness to hang Campbell first and submit the serious constitutional issues he raises &quot; on cruel_and_unusual_punishment to the Supreme Court for decision later , Reinhardt wrote . &quot; So the 9th Circuit returns , at least for now , to the rough Western justice of frontier days : Hang ' em first , ask questions later. &quot; James Lobsenz , Campbell ' s attorney , said he will appeal_to the Supreme Court immediately . It is possible that either Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor , who handles emergency appeals from the 9th Circuit , could grant Campbell a stay , or that the full court could issue a stay if five of the nine justices vote to do so . But legal observers said a stay is unlikely . Now 39 , Campbell was convicted of slashing the throats of two women and a child in Clearview , Wash. , in 1982 . The women had testified in a 1976 trial in which Campbell was convicted of attacking and sodomizing one of them . There has been a stay_of_execution in_effect since March 28 , 1989 , because of appeals on various issues . The Supreme Court has declined to review the case twice . &quot; We ' re extremely pleased that the 9th Circuit has finally cleared the way &quot; for the execution , said Paul D . Weisser , an assistant attorney_general in Washington who has been critical of the lengthy appeal process . This will allow &quot; justice to be done at long last , &quot; Weisser added . The prosecutor said 9th Circuit officials told him that the stay_of_execution will be lifted immediately . Under Washington law , that would permit the execution to be conducted &quot; within 30 judicial days , &quot; meaning an execution date of May 27 . &quot; We anticipate that there is going_to be a flurry of activity between now and that date as Campbell concocts various mechanisms to try to forestall that date , &quot; Weisser said . &quot; We will do whatever we have to do to ensure that the execution occurs on_time , without further delay. &quot; The majority_opinion noted that the 9th Circuit ' s action does not prevent Campbell from seeking a further stay_of_execution with the Supreme Court . &quot; However , &quot; Reinhardt objected , &quot; that should not ease the conscience of any member of this court or serve as an excuse for anyone ' s failure to perform his or her duty properly. &quot; Reinhardt said the 9th Circuit was obligated to issue a stay unless Campbell made a frivolous claim or appealed solely to delay matters . Campbell ' s claim that hanging constitutes cruel_and_unusual_punishment , Reinhardt said , clearly is not a frivolous claim for a variety of reasons , including the fact that Washington is one of only two states that permit execution by hanging . The other is Montana . Washington law gives a condemned individual the choice of death by hanging or lethal injection . But Campbell declined to choose , and under the law , that means execution by hanging . Laurie Levenson , a Loyola University criminal_law professor , said Friday ' s majority_opinion &quot; is a clear indication that the 9th Circuit got the message from the Supreme Court and will move to expedite death_penalty cases. &quot; Levenson said Campbell faces an uphill battle in his attempt to gain a stay from the Supreme Court . Levenson also said Friday ' s opinions reflect the continuing deep divisions within the 9th Circuit on all aspects of the death_penalty . All six judges in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents . The five dissenters were appointed by President Jimmy_Carter .</TEXT>
