   <TEXT> * &quot; Protecting Human Guinea_Pigs &quot; ( Jan . 16 ) clearly demonstrates the need for strong regulation , oversight , and enforcement to prevent scientists from performing medical experiments on human_beings without their consent . However , when it comes_to immoral and unethical business practices , a separate standard seems to apply . The Environmental Protection Agency reported a_few years ago that in one year alone , 1987 , industry was permitted to spew at least 22.5 billion pounds of toxic and cancer-causing chemicals into the nation ' s air , land and water . Are we not all unwilling guinea_pigs to this toxic onslaught ? If we hold individuals responsible_for their actions how , and why , is industry permitted to get_away with committing such abominable acts ? LARRY SIEGEL Torrance * The article described Turner syndrome individuals as mentally_retarded . There is no relationship between Turner syndrome and mental_retardation . Because Turner syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality and early studies were conducted with inadequate sampling , inaccurate assumptions have continued to be made by those without experience with Turner syndrome or understanding of the condition . In fact , the over 2 # 500 Turner syndrome women in our organization are as bright and competent as any other group of individuals . Many , including myself , are professionally educated and face the same struggles of career and family facing all professionals . Also , the article ' s point on the studies of human_growth_hormone in Turner syndrome does not show any understanding of the complexity of the issues involved . Placebo controls are the cornerstone of medical scientific_research . The girls participating in the NIH trials deserve our gratitude and admiration , not pity . They and countless others using growth_hormone , in studies or otherwise , have given us much information that shows an increase in growth velocity and indicates strongly an increase in final adult height . These additional inches do much to improve the ability of Turner syndrome women to contribute to society to their fullest potential and be accepted as the competent , worthwhile beings they are and not the defenseless , defective little_girls the article depicts . LYNN-GEORGIA TESCH Executive_Director Turner Syndrome Society Wayzata , Minn . * What is most evident to me in the wake of Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary ' s recent revelations of unethical nuclear experimentation on humans is that there have always been in our society groups of people who are considered expendable . The expendables include people_of_color , the mentally and physically infirm , and the poor of all races . Evidence clearly establishes that not just medical and educational_institutions , but criminal justice , military and social_service agencies have regarded these groups as less than deserving of their full attention and concern unless they could be used to make the unexpendables ' lives more comfortable . The Tuskegee syphilis experiments showed African Americans the hazards of placing blind trust in government institutions . It has often been said that evil occurs when good people are silent . Only when white , middle-class , healthy America awakens to and becomes angry at a government which uses_up its &quot; expendable &quot; citizenry and repeatedly lies to cover it up will these atrocities stop .
