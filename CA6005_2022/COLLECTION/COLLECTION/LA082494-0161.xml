   <TEXT> Nature easily beats any human efforts to capture energy from the sun : Nothing matches photosynthesis , the process by which plants use chlorophyll to convert light into food . A study by a University of Southern California chemist shows that a purple_bacteria found in pond_scum uses light energy with almost 95 % efficiency -- more_than four times that of the best manufactured solar_cells . By better understanding the bacteria ' s energy-conversion process , the chemist , Chi Ho Mak , believes it may be possible to one day re-create it as an artificial solar_energy cell . Mak and Reinhold Egger of the University of Freiburg , Germany , have used a supercomputer to create a model of chlorophyll ' s energy conversion process . In the purple_bacteria the two studied , photosynthesis began when a special pair of chlorophyll molecules absorbed a unit of green_light radiation ( a photon ) . In a reaction lasting only three-trillionths of a second , the chlorophyll transferred a high-energy electron to a nearby molecule of a substance called pheophytin , storing the solar_energy in what amounts to a biochemical battery . A complex series of chemical_reactions then converted the energy of the electron into products the bacterium needed to live , grow and reproduce . The research has a long way to go , but it is a first_step toward re-creating a photosynthetic reaction center in a manufactured device . Running_on Air : Student researchers at UC Riverside have come_up with a novel twist on that much-sought-after vehicle , the non-polluting , gasoline-free automobile . They ' ve developed a modified golf_cart that runs_on the electricity generated by hydrogen and oxygen in the air around us . The cart uses a fuel_cell originally developed for space applications . When hydrogen stored in a tank comes_into contact with oxygen and phosphoric_acid , it gives_off electrons that are collected in the fuel_cell , which then becomes a source of electricity . The only byproduct is water_vapor . The fuel_cell promises to be about 2 1 / 2 times more efficient than the internal_combustion engine . The hydrogen itself is produced at UC Riverside ' s Solar Hydrogen Research Facility , by a solar-powered electrolyzer that splits ordinary water molecules into individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms . James Heffel , the project manager , believes the hydrogen can be produced for the equivalent of $ 2 to $ 3 a gallon . Such fuel-cell vehicles could meet the zero-emissions standards recently adopted by the California Air Resources Board . In theory , they would have greater range than electric_cars that have to be recharged from an outlet . The Sound of Location : When bats fly , they send_out a sonar signal to guide them along . But how does one bat distinguish its own signal from those of hundreds of other bats around it ? The answer to this question has relevance , it seems , not only for mouse-like flying mammals and sonar-guided torpedoes but for electric_companies trying to locate downed power_lines . Inspired by the bat ' s enviable signal-processing capabilities , Edward Titlebaum , a professor of electrical_engineering at the University of Rochester in New York , developed a series of codes for the Navy several years ago . The codes guaranteed that signals from sonar-guided torpedoes remained distinct and did not become crossed . Now Titlebaum is working with engineers from Rochester Gas &amp; Electric Corp . to apply these codes to help track_down faulty power_lines . Now utilities must wait for customers to telephone complaining of a downed line . Titlebaum ' s idea is to outfit each power_line with a transmitter that every so often sends a distinctive signal back to the utility . A missing signal would indicate that a line was down . Using a family of codes known as hyperbolic congruence frequency hop codes -- in which a signal hops across several frequencies per second -- Titlebaum was able to create these distinguishable signals . The reason these codes are distinctive is that only one or two frequencies are congruent . A correlation receiver looks_for the exact sequence of frequencies it is supposed to receive .</TEXT>
