   <HEADLINE> MULCH TYPES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are many kinds of mulch to choose from , including : ORGANIC Bark Chips and Ground Bark . Attractive and often used as a decorative material . It decomposes very slowly . On the downside , bark can harbor pests such_as earwigs , termites and sow_bugs . Compost . Homemade or purchased is an excellent source of organic matter that improves the soil . It can be bought or made from materials found in the yard , such_as grass clippings and leaves . If not properly composted , compost may contain weed seeds . Grass Clippings and Leaves . Readily available for most gardeners . If not dried first , grass and leaves can mat and reduce water penetration . It is best to compost them , as this will kill weed seeds . Hay and Straw . Promotes good water penetration and makes an attractive mulch . May contain grain seeds , however , which can germinate . Leaf_Mold . Adds acidity to our alkaline soils . It also looks attractive and natural . This can be found bagged in the nursery . Newspapers . Readily available , but they aren ' t as visually attractive as other types of mulch . They also tend to blow around in the wind . Peat_Moss . Adds acidity to alkaline soils and contains very few weeds . It is expensive and resists wetting when dry . Pine Needles . Add acidity to the soil and break_down slowly . They should only be used on acid-loving plants . Pressed Paper . Heavy fibrous paper for mulching , such_as Hortopaper , is made specifically for mulching . It has good water and air penetration but does tend to tear after transplanting , or if it ' s walked on . Sawdust . Improves the organic content of the soil , but if it mats , it will inhibit water penetration . It decomposes rapidly and may blow away . This may also contain an organic_compound that can harm young plants . INORGANIC Used Carpet . It ' s visually unattractive and can produce an offensive odor when wet , but is one of the most long-lasting and durable methods of mulching . Black Plastic . It ' s been used for years to smother undesirable weeds . The plastic breaks_down in a_few months , however , and is not very attractive , often requiring a top mulch , such_as bark . Weeds grow easily through any holes . Clear Plastic . Similar to black plastic , but will encourage weed growth unless you place a top mulch on it . Weeds grow easily through any holes . Woven Polypropylene and Nonwoven Polyester . Allows air and water penetration . It is very effective and generally long-lasting , although it can be expensive and unattractive , requiring a top mulch . Photodegradable Plastic . Lasts indefinitely if not exposed to light . Crushed Stone or Gravel . An attractive mulch , but tends to become infested with weeds if used alone . It is also expensive and may get hot in the sun .
