   <HEADLINE> ROLE OF RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN GOP SWEEP CALLED TOP STORY ; POLL : JOURNALISTS SURVEYED PICKED POPE JOHN PAUL II AS THE BIGGEST RELIGION NEWSMAKER OF 1994 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The role of the religious right in November ' s Republican election sweep was the top religion story of 1994 , according to a national poll of journalists specializing in religion news coverage . Having led millions of voters to the polls , the Christian coalition and abortion foes are now expected to use their political muscle on such issues as abortion funding and school prayer . Besides ranking the top stories in the 50-item poll , members of the Religion Newswriters Association picked Pope John Paul II as the religion newsmaker of 1994 . Members cover religion news for newspapers , wire_services and news magazines . They cited the pontiff ' s authorship of a best-selling book ; his instruction halting discussion of priesthood for women ; his success in getting the U.N. Conference on Population and Development in Cairo not to endorse international abortion rights ; the church ' s new Catechism ; the Pope ' s many trips and health_problems , and his appointment of conservatives as new cardinals . In summary , one association member said the Pope had been &quot; awesomely influential. &quot; A distant runner-up for religion newsmaker of the year was Paul Hill , an ex-minister convicted of killing an abortion doctor and escort . Hill , said an association member , &quot; put a face &quot; on the extremist wing of the anti-abortion movement . Among others nominated for religion newsmaker were President Clinton ; House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich ; former President Jimmy_Carter , and Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn . There was no clear-cut winner of the association ' s &quot; Into the Darkness &quot; designation , given to those who withhold information from the reading public . However , the most votes went_to the Episcopal Church ' s House of Bishops for keeping secret a draft statement on human sexuality . The No . 2 story in religion in 1994 , according to the poll , was Pope John Paul ' s instruction to his bishops ending discussion of priesthood for women . The U.S. bishops , in a related development , acknowledged sexism in the church and encouraged women to assume non-priestly leadership positions . Optional use of female altar servers was permitted . A &quot; Re-Imagining &quot; conference in late 1993 in Minneapolis , called to rethink women ' s concepts of God , ranked No . 3 in the poll . The conference brought angry protests , threats to withhold donations and the firing of a Presbyterian_Church ( USA ) executive . Ranking No . 4 was Hill ' s conviction for killing the abortion doctor and escort . Other developments that made the top 10 list included : * Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed an agreement beginning Israel ' s withdrawal from Gaza and the West_Bank ' s Jericho area and granting Palestinians a measure of self-government . Later , the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to PLO leader Yasser Arafat , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his foreign_minister , Shimon Peres , for their peace efforts . Also , the Vatican and Israel established diplomatic relations . * The Church_of_England ordained 32 women priests . Opposition to such ordinations prompted an Episcopal parish and a retired Episcopal bishop in Texas to convert to Roman_Catholicism . * Forty-eight members of a doomsday sect , the Order of the Solar Temple , were found dead after fires in two Swiss villages . Another five sect members were found dead in Canada . * A &quot; painful ordeal &quot; of several months ended for Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin when an alleged victim of sexual abuse dropped him from a lawsuit . U.S. bishops received a detailed resource manual on how to deal with sexual abuse of minors by church personnel . * In his new book , &quot; Crossing the Threshold of Hope , &quot; Pope John Paul discussed why God has allowed so many religions to exist and attempted to show the &quot; common fundamental element and the common root of these religions. &quot; * The United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo concluded that population_control cannot be disentangled from women ' s rights and urged economic betterment for women and families . Among other developments ranked as significant were : * While recognizing that doctrinal differences still divide them , 39 Roman_Catholic and evangelical scholars signed a statement pledging to reduce conflicts between their traditions and to cooperate on common concerns such_as abortion and parental choice in schools . * Ending nearly half a century of racial separation , the all-white association of Pentecostal denominations voted to disband to clear the way for a new multiethnic organization , the Pentecostal Churches of North_America , open_to an estimated 16 million U.S. Pentecostals . * Enormous interest in angels was reflected in prime_time TV_programs and a flood of books and angel-themed products . * The first draft of a proposed human sexuality statement created a furor within the Evangelical Lutheran_Church in America , which affirmed certain homosexual relationships . A second draft was called &quot; more moderate. &quot; * Oregon voters approved physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill . * True Love Waits , a Southern Baptist Convention campaign encouraging teen-agers to abstain_from sex until they marry , spread to church groups across the nation . * The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Constitution was violated when the New York Legislature created a special school district for disabled children of a Hasidic Jewish group . * Nelson Mandela was inaugurated as South_Africa ' s black president after his African National Congress swept an all-race election .
