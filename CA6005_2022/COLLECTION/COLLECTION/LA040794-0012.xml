   <HEADLINE> THE BEAR IS JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR ; RUSSIA : THE DAYS OF BEING THE WEST ' S LACKEY ARE OVER , AS THOSE WHO STAND FOR A STRONG , PROUD NATION COME TO THE FORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Back in the bad old days , the American media had only negative things to say about the Soviet_Union . Not that there was really much information offered , but whatever it was , it was all negative . In TV reports even the skies over Moscow were always gray . Now , of course , things have changed . Americans get a far greater quantity and variety of information concerning Russia . But , considering how many U.S. news bureaus are stationed there , it is still amazing to see what is missed . For example , no note has been made -- at least in any of the mainstream media -- of what I think is a truly significant event . On March 4 , the influential Nezavisimaya Gazeta ( Independent Newspaper ) published the results of a monthly poll , conducted by the highly regarded Moscow-based Vox Populi Public_Opinion Research Institute . The poll , &quot; Russia ' s 100 Leading Politicians , &quot; is considered by both the Establishment and the public as an accurate reflection of a politician ' s rating . The latest results were a shocker . For the first time in more_than a year , Yeltsin slipped from first place to second . Prime_Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin took_over the top spot . Acting quickly to heal whatever wound this news might have dealt to Yeltsin ' s ego , Chernomyrdin chastised the media for &quot; sensationalizing meaningless political ratings &quot; -- something he would hardly have done , had he indeed considered those ratings meaningless . But there was more . Vitaly Churkin , Russia ' s deputy minister of foreign affairs , a key player in putting the Bosnian Serbs in synch with the NATO-energized peace process , saw his standings in the poll catapulted from a tie for 99th place , in January , to a tie for 18th . Third place went_to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov , a name unfamiliar to most Americans , Russia-watchers included ( but then , it took most of them a long_time to pay_attention to Vladimir Zhirinovsky ) . Meanwhile , America ' s darling reformist Yegor Gaidar slipped from 3rd place to 9th . Chernomyrdin , Churkin and Luzhkov have all demonstrated that , first , they firmly believe_in Russia ' s inherent greatness and will stand_up for its interests both in the &quot; near abroad &quot; ( the former republics ) and elsewhere ; second , that they have faith in Russia ' s ability to solve its problems , and , most important , this troika has never hidden its distaste for Western recipes -- economic or political . In a country not accustomed to polling , not involved in the game-playing that becomes inevitable when polling becomes at least as much of a political instrument as a method of gauging attitudes , the results of a monthly poll , which have been consistent for more_than a year and suddenly undergoes dramatic change , should be taken seriously . Between the end of the Gorbachev years and the summer of 1993 , Russia offered the West a unique window of opportunity . The country was at a crossroads . Disenchanted and disillusioned with their past , the people were prepared to accept a radically different future . A George Marshall would have been quick to capitalize on this . He would have mapped_out a strategic plan to channel funds and investments to pressure points in Russia . This time , America would not have to go it alone , as after World_War_II in Europe , but could work with its European and Japanese allies . The results would have been spectacular . Alas , there was no George Marshall . In fact , there never existed any coherent policy , let alone grand strategy , toward post-Soviet Russia . Instead there persists the pernicious and arrogant view that America won , and Russia lost , the Cold_War and therefore Russia should be treated as a defeated foe . A foe that must please America if it expects to be rewarded . In Russia , a country that was not defeated and whose people never considered themselves vanquished , this policy has fed anti-American sentiment , set people against reformists seen as being pro-Western and slammed shut that window of opportunity . It has brought_to the forefront politicians who stand_for a strong , proud Russia that marches to its own drummer . They are neither Zhirinovsky-like ultra-nationalists , nor Communist_Party ideologues . They are conservative pragmatists who will pursue Russia ' s interests , and they are here to stay . Not long ago , I attended a news_conference in Washington . Addressing the audience on the issue of Russian-U.S. relations , one of the most knowledgeable journalists in that area , Martin Walker of the Manchester Guardian , said : &quot; The time when Russia agreed to play pet poodle to George_Bush and Bill_Clinton is gone_for good. &quot; He did not say the bear was back , but I think the poll no one here has paid_attention to says just that .</TEXT>
