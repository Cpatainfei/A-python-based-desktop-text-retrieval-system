   <HEADLINE> GOVERNMENT WILL FREE UP AIRWAVES FOR COMMERCIAL USE ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : ACTION WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE BANDS AVAILABLE FOR USE ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration on Thursday freed up a slice of the nation ' s airwaves for new commercial communications technologies and proposed that an even bigger chunk of government-controlled airwaves be relinquished for future commercial use . The changes -- which could begin as early as this summer and continue into the next decade -- could help the government raise billions of dollars by nearly doubling the proportion of the airwaves it could make available to businesses for wireless phone , data , video transmission and other telecommunications services . Such mobile communications services represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the $ 300-billion telecommunications industry . Telephone and computer engineers , among others , are rushing to develop products that will allow users to send and receive faxes , voice , video and other information from devices as portable and unobtrusive as a wrist_watch . The freeing up of airwaves was proposed after the Coast Guard , Department_of_Energy and other government_agencies agreed -- after a year of bitter negotiations -- to relinquish control over 200 megahertz of valuable radio_frequency . A hertz is a unit of frequency in a radio_spectrum that ranges from cosmic rays to TV and radio_waves . Broadcasters , phone_companies , satellite operators and others use these airwaves to transmit voice , video and other information . But each service ties_up slices of radio_spectrum . The 200-megahertz chunk is significant : The FM radio band uses just 20 megahertz , for example ; cellular_phones use another 50 . Under the accord , some military activities , such_as air_defense radar systems and military communications links , would be forced to move outside the block of airwaves being reallocated to make_way for commercial use . Experts expect the proposal to provoke a huge lobbying campaign pitting business against military interests . The Commerce_Department is giving all parties about three months to comment on its proposals , after which they may be modified . Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown hailed the proposal as an important step toward opening_up the telecommunications industry to more competition and innovation . He said a quarter of the airwaves will be immediately turned_over to the Federal Communications Commission for allocation to private commercial interests . &quot; This plan has great commercial value as we attempt to construct an information superhighway that reaches all_the American people , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It will clearly promote competition in communications , which should have the effect of driving down prices for all consumers. &quot; The FCC has said it hopes to raise between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion when it begins auctioning airwaves this summer that have been designated for a new wireless technology called personal communications services . Larry Irving , assistant secretary_of_commerce for communications and information , who coordinated work_on the Commerce_Department plan , said he does not believe that freeing up such a huge block of frequencies will depress prices for the other frequencies the FCC contemplates auctioning . But the FCC has not yet adopted auction rules . Agency officials said they have the discretion not to auction the 200-megahertz block of government-controlled airwaves and instead allocate them by lottery or through administrative_hearings .</TEXT>
