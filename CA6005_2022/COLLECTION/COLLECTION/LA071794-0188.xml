   <HEADLINE> REAL_ESTATE BECOMING A DANGEROUS PROFESSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have been a licensed real_estate_broker for 17 years , and it was with horror that I read about the abduction of the Val Verde agent . Increased visibility in the market has made the female real_estate_agent more of a target for weirdos.Even though the industry has addressed the issues of safety from time to time , not one person , company or association has taken the proactive step of declaring a direct change of policy to insure their agents ' welfare . At best , most offices only suggest prudent conduct . It should become mandatory that new clients must first come_to the office and register upon meeting the agent . The client ' s driver ' s license should be kept_on file . A telephone_number should be verified . A colleague or member of the management team should accompany their agents while showing vacant homes or remote properties . Advertising that mentions that a home is unoccupied should not be permitted . Open_houses have been problematic for many years . They present a chance for the wrong people to enter a home freely for the wrong reasons . Numerous burglaries have been reported where one party gets the real_estate_agent ' s attention and another searches for valuables . They have also been the sites of attacks and murder . How long can the real_estate industry ignore this danger before some one has the courage to affect much needed procedural changes to limit their agents risk ?
