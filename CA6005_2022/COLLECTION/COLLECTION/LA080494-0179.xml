   <TEXT> The convention hall near the National Congress was festooned with flags bearing Islamic symbols and posters of Jerusalem ' s Dome of the Rock shrine . About 100 Argentine right-wing activists and Shiite Muslims filled the audience . In the front row sat diplomats from the Iranian Embassy . The embassy ' s cultural affairs officer , Imam Mohsen Rabbani , rose . &quot; Israel , &quot; he intoned in accented Spanish , &quot; must disappear from the face of the Earth. &quot; He and a dozen speakers who followed quoted Iran ' s late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and called_for unity in the fight against Zionism and the satanism of the West . Such rhetoric and trappings would not be unusual in the Middle_East . But this was the other side of the world : downtown Buenos Aires , three years ago . Rabbani ' s activities in Argentina are attracting new attention in the wake of the terrorist bombing last month that killed nearly 100 people at a Jewish community_center . That suicide bombing , an airliner bombing in Panama the next day , a 1992 attack that destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires and other incidents in recent years point to what U.S. officials and security experts believe is a little-noticed presence of radical Islamic groups in Latin_America . The Rabbani meeting , described for The Times by people who were present , has not been tied to any act of violence . And both Rabbani and the leaders of Argentina ' s small Shiite community have condemned the bombings . But officials here are now questioning whether Iranian diplomats such_as Rabbani have had a role in indoctrinating or aiding terrorists , who can use Latin_America ' s lax security to their advantage . The armed branch of Hezbollah , the fundamentalist Party of God based in Lebanon , and other violent groups are thought to have been planting agents and recruiting sympathizers in Latin_America since the mid-1980s , using the general flow of mainstream Arab and Muslim immigrants as cover , terrorism experts say . Of the millions worldwide who hold the Muslim faith , only a small percentage are fundamentalists , and an even smaller number are extremists who advocate violence . Although proof is still being accumulated , American and Israeli officials have blamed the two Argentina bombings on Hezbollah , which has been exchanging blows with Israel in Lebanon for more_than a decade . A legal political_party that has militant wings , Hezbollah is also suspected in two bombings in London last month . Its political_leaders deny involvement . Many parts of Latin_America make an ideal landscape for terrorists : porous borders ; inept law_enforcement combined with weak investigative skills ; large Jewish , Arab and other communities drawn from conflict-ridden parts of the world ; established rings of smugglers , drug_traffickers and arms merchants , and entrenched traditions of corruption . In Argentina , a long string of anti-Semitic attacks has gone virtually unpunished for nearly two decades . &quot; Hezbollah is mainly engaged in terrorism in Europe and the Middle_East , but it has migrated to Latin_America , &quot; said Robert Kupperman , a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . &quot; There are a lot of Israelis ( in Latin_America ) -- a lot of targets -- and it ' s a springboard to the United States . . . . The purpose behind the ( latest ) bombings is that Hezbollah wants to show it has a long arm and can reach anywhere. &quot; Argentina has the largest Jewish community in Latin_America , at about 250 # 000 ; the population of Arab descendants is more_than triple that number . The scope of Hezbollah ' s ability to attack in Latin_America is not known . The actual membership may be quite small , and little hard evidence of the clandestine group ' s activities is available . But investigators and intelligence specialists cite the following factors_in addition to the two Argentina blasts : * The day after Buenos Aires ' seven-story Jewish community_center was reduced to rubble on July 18 , a suicide bomber said to be Lebanese and unable to speak Spanish or English boarded a commuter flight in Colon , Panama , near the Atlantic end of the Panama_Canal . When he detonated the bomb , all 21 people aboard were killed , including 12 Jewish and Israeli businessmen , and three U.S. citizens . * In a report earlier this year , Argentine intelligence identified the jungle region at the border with Paraguay and Brazil as a potential base of operation for Middle Eastern terrorists . The area has an estimated 30 # 000 Lebanese Shiites , many there illegally . The car and explosives used in the 1992 embassy attack were reportedly traced to the region . &quot; They ( Hezbollah radicals ) have the capability to do something in Brazil , probably Caracas ( Venezuela ) , and I ' d say most of the major urban_areas of Latin_America , &quot; said Vincent Cannistraro , a former senior CIA officer who is an international security_consultant in Washington . * A senior leader of the Abu Nidal organization , a renegade group of radical Palestinians , was arrested in Lima , Peru , in 1988 , thwarting a reported plan to blow_up the Israeli Embassy and a synagogue there . In 1992 , seven alleged members of Islamic Jihad -- another radical fundamentalist group in the Mideast -- were arrested in Quito , Ecuador , by Interpol agents who claimed the men planned attacks on the Israeli ambassador in Bogota , Colombia . * Venezuela last month expelled four Iranian diplomats and declared the Iranian ambassador persona_non_grata . All were accused of plotting to kidnap an Iranian defector , who later provided evidence implicating other Iranian officials in the Argentina bombings . Despite these indications , some Argentine observers are skeptical that a significant Middle Eastern terrorist network exists in their country . Rather than an entrenched Hezbollah organization , they see a more ad-hoc union formed for specific operations . &quot; I think there could easily be an alliance ( of Middle Eastern terrorists ) with groups here that are not necessarily Islamic , such_as the neo-Nazis , who are not of great importance but who are nevertheless dangerous , &quot; said Norberto Mendez , a social_scientist who teaches courses on fundamentalism at the University of Buenos Aires . &quot; The fundamentalist Shiites here probably have nothing to do with ( the July 18 bombing ) . They would be such obvious suspects . . . . That they have ties with Iran , there is no doubt . But that does not link them with terrorism. &quot; Abdul Karim Paz , an Argentine convert to Islam who runs the Al-Tahuid mosque in Buenos Aires , said Wednesday that while he supports Hezbollah ' s struggle in Lebanon , he would end that support if it were proved that the group carried_out the Buenos Aires bombings . People outside the Mideast should not be brought into Hezbollah ' s conflict with Israel , he said . And Argentina ' s ambassador to the United States , Raul Granillo Ocampo , told a U.S. congressional hearing this week that Argentina ' s Shiite community is too small to have a terrorist infrastructure . Still , in Buenos Aires the investigation is focusing_on two fronts : the evident existence of a local support network for the terrorists -- perhaps including unwitting participants -- and the Iranian Embassy ' s possible role in the planning or execution of the bombings . Investigators believe they have pieced together the steps leading to the purchase and rigging of the car_bomb used July 18 , and judicial officials have indicated that they want to question up_to five Iranian diplomats , some of whom have left the country . Separately , U.S. forensic specialists dispatched here are trying to determine the bomber ' s physical characteristics . They have little evidence : His remains are among body_parts collected in 10 bags . So far , five Argentines have been detained for questioning , including men who bought and refurbished a Renault van that was later used as the car_bomb . But there is no indication at this point that the men had knowledge of the bombing . In fact , Argentine officials concede their investigation is_full of holes . &quot; As far as the police are concerned , the investigation is very advanced , &quot; Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf told the_Argentine newspaper Clarin . &quot; But being able to prove it judicially , where the suspect has rights and can refuse to testify , is another matter . Argentina cannot act like Israel , which determines who is politically guilty and then bombs them. &quot; Argentine officials contend that their investigation is hampered by their inexperience with international terrorism -- and because a ruthless national security apparatus was dismantled after democracy replaced military dictatorship a decade ago . The lack of expertise was obvious in the investigation of the 1992 Israeli Embassy bombing . No arrests were made except for four Pakistanis who were quickly released for lack of evidence . President Carlos Saul Menem , who is of Syrian descent but has sided with Israel on several foreign_policy matters , has gone_to great lengths to assure Jewish leaders -- and the world -- that this time his government has undertaken a thorough investigation . But critics , including several Jewish leaders , question the political will of some government officials , especially in law_enforcement , where some officers are said to have fascist sympathies . An army intelligence_agent was arrested after an arsenal and Nazi literature were found in his house . Alejandro Sucksdorf was not discreet : Signs_on the fence around his house bore swastikas . &quot; I do not have the least doubt that the ( July 18 ) bomb was the child of the impunity surrounding earlier acts of terrorism , &quot; said Sergio D . Widder , the representative in Argentina of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center . Jewish groups have documented 30 anti-Semitic incidents in Argentina in the last 20 years . In fact , initial suspicion after the July 18 bombing fell on neo-Nazi groups , in part because the bomb exploded at the hour of a regularly scheduled meeting of a committee assigned to study newly released government files on Nazis in South_America . The meeting had been canceled unexpectedly . But because of the skill and evident advance planning involved in the attack , the hateful but not well-organized neo-Nazi groups were dismissed as likely suspects . U.S. officials admit they did not note the arrival of Islamic fundamentalists in Latin_America until the 1992 bombing . But they now say they believe Hezbollah clerics began working in Lebanese communities in Argentina , Brazil and Paraguay in the mid- and late 1980s , at the height of the Lebanese civil_war , and that Hezbollah cells began to form . &quot; The explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 came as a bolt from the blue , &quot; said a U.S. official who specializes in terrorism . &quot; I don ' t think we ever had any thought or any inkling that Hezbollah had an operational presence in Latin_America . &quot; After we began looking , a lot of concern centered_on the tri-border area . . . . It turns_out that Hezbollah has been working there for several years , beginning with an effort to do fund raising for their operations in Lebanon. &quot; Brazilian police and the_Argentine National Intelligence Service became interested in the tri-border cities of Ciudad del Este in Paraguay and Foz do Iguacu in Brazil , after learning of contacts between alleged Hezbollah members and arms traffickers in the area , Clarin said , citing the_Argentine intelligence report . Long known as a center for contraband and prostitution , the region is a bustling place of intrigue . Arabic is heard as much as , or perhaps more_than , Spanish in Ciudad del Este , and shopping there can just as easily net a visitor a fake passport or an automatic_rifle as a watch . The borders are also heavily forested , law-enforcement vigilance is virtually nonexistent , and tens of thousands of foreign tourists arrive every year to visit the nearby Iguacu Falls . To prove how easily the borders can be crossed , two reporters from an Argentine magazine traveled_to the area less than 48 hours after the community-center bombing , as President Menem was claiming borders had been closed to prevent the escape of possible suspects . &quot; Here we check no one , &quot; a Paraguayan immigration police_officer told the magazine Gente . &quot; Anyone can come_through here , from anywhere in the world and work in whatever occurs to him. &quot; Diplomats also say Argentina ' s passport is easily reproduced . In their investigation , Argentine authorities are relying heavily on the testimony of the Iranian defector in Venezuela who implicated up_to five members of Iran ' s diplomatic_mission in Buenos Aires . Monoucher Motamer is said to have sought asylum after the Iranians allegedly tried to kidnap him . The incident prompted the Venezuelan government to expel the diplomats and ban the ambassador . Unconfirmed Argentine news_reports have since suggested that Motamer was a CIA agent . Menem has said Argentina will break diplomatic relations with Iran if its involvement is proven . Many in Argentina ' s Arab and Muslim communities fear they are being made a scapegoat . Arabs from Lebanon , Syria and Egypt -- most of them Christian -- began migrating to Argentina in the middle of the 19th Century in search of business opportunities and , much later , to escape war . &quot; There are two types of victims here -- the dead and wounded , and now there are the victims of ideological repression , ( suffering ) a type of witch hunt , &quot; said Gabriel Ali , a representative of a local Muslim organization . If terrorism in Argentina caught the world by surprise , Panama as a scenario was even less expected , and some diplomats and officials think there may_not be a Middle_East connection in the bombing . Panama does not share Argentina ' s history of overt anti-Semitism . But it has long been a haven for fugitives of all sorts , and it is a well-known center for money_laundering and other shady dealings . The suicide bomber was said to have had a clumsily forged U.S. passport . He apparently had not been in Panama very long . The case is still under investigation , but officials in Washington said the attack -- atypical of Hezbollah in_style and method -- reflected advance intelligence and preparation : The bomber knew what flight would be carrying Israeli and Jewish businessmen . Such planning reflects deep roots in the area , the officials said . Times staff writers Doyle McManus and Robin Wright in Washington contributed to this report . Terrorist Group Profiles Among the terrorist organizations believed active in Latin_America : * Hezbollah : Iranian-backed radical Shiite Islamic group . Most active in Mideast . Spiritual adviser : Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah . * Abu Nidal : Known as Fatah Revolutionary Council in the Mideast , and headed there by terrorist Abu Nidal .

Claimed responsibility for attacks on U.S. Embassy and Marines in Lebanon in 1983 . Believed to be part of Hezbollah . The Latin Connection Many parts of Latin_America make an ideal landscape for terrorists . U.S. officials admit that they did not notice the arrival of Islamic fundamentalists in Latin_America until 1992 . Countries where terrorists are believed to be_active are shown in white . PANAMA BRAZIL PARAGUAY ARGENTINA Tri-border region ( Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay ) is a center for prostitution and smuggling . It is also a reputed support base for Hezbollah . Ingredients for Terrorism * Porous borders * Lax law_enforcement * Large immigrant communities from conflict-ridden parts of the world * Established rings of smugglers and arms merchants * Traditions of corruption</TEXT>
