   <HEADLINE> WHAT TO DO IF YOU can ' t PAY MORTGAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : We never believed this would happen to us . We have owned our house for many years and currently owe several months of mortgage payments . The equity in our house is somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 60 # 000- $ 70 # 000 , but since I lost my job recently , I can neither make the mortgage payments nor do I want to move somewhere else . I have heard about a deed in lieu of foreclosure , but do not understand how it works . Can you explain ? ANSWER : None of us can anticipate what the future will bring . Once in a while , calamity strikes , and then we have to face these very hard questions . Before addressing the deed in lieu of foreclosure issue , let me outline for you a number of steps when dealing with your mortgage lender . At the outset it must be pointed_out that if you want the lender to cooperate with you , there has to be an equal level of cooperation on your side . Indeed , according to the Freddie Mac guidelines on alternatives to foreclosure , the secondary mortgage market gives a mortgage lender broad discretion to extend relief &quot; to a borrower who encounters hardship , is cooperative and has proper regard for fulfilling obligations . . . . &quot; The first possible relief is referred to as &quot; temporary indulgence. &quot; Here , the lender , on request , may grant the borrower a short period_of_time -- usually not more_than three months -- to cure any delinquency . However , this is merely temporary relief , and by the end of the short period_of_time , the borrower must be completely current . Another approach is a repayment plan . Here , the borrower is given a fixed period_of_time -- usually not to exceed one year -- in which to bring the mortgage current by immediately making and continuing to make payments in excess of the monthly mortgage payment . It is advisable to set_down this repayment plan in a written document , signed by both the lender and the borrower . Lenders also can enter into what is known as a &quot; special forbearance relief agreement , &quot; in which the regular monthly mortgage payments are suspended or reduced for a period of up_to 18 months from the due_date of the first unpaid monthly installment . At the conclusion of this relief period , the regular_payments must be resumed , and more important , a comprehensive plan must be agreed upon so as_to repay the amount that has been suspended . In this case , the lender must satisfy itself that the default is curable , and based on the current financial and appraisal data , the lender must be satisfied that there is a likelihood that the borrower will be able to comply with the repayment plan . Clearly , the burden is_on the borrower to document and justify the plan , so as_to satisfy the lender ' s requirements . If you are in the military , the Soldier ' s and Sailor ' s Relief Act provides various forms of relief , but you should check with your military or civilian lawyer to determine your eligibility under that Act . The deed in lieu of foreclosure is another remedy that may be available to you . Under this arrangement , you deed your property to the lender ( or to whomever the lender designates ) and this is in lieu of ( instead of ) foreclosure proceedings . This arrangement is an acceptable and customary procedure when , for example , the borrower is deceased and the estate is willing_and_able to transfer the property , or the borrower has filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy , and the trustee has abandoned interest in the property . There are a number of requirements to accomplish a deed in lieu , and each lender will have their own set of guidelines . Generally speaking , however , the following requirements are usually imposed by a lender that is willing to accept the deed in lieu : 1 -- The borrower has a valid and documented reason for default that is beyond the borrower ' s control . 2 -- The borrower has demonstrated that he or she has made and can make prudent financial decisions since the default . 3 -- The borrower has been cooperative and has provided any and all necessary documentation to the lender . Additionally , the borrower must permit the lender to have reasonable access to inspect the inside of the property . 4 -- The borrower must be willing to make a financial contribution , if this is at all possible . 5 -- If the lender has escrowed money for the payment of future taxes and insurance , the borrower must be willing to forgo reimbursement of these escrowed funds . Additionally , the lender will not even consider taking the property as a deed in lieu unless the property has been listed for_sale at market_value , and all attempts to sell the property have failed . Finally , there can be no outstanding liens or other encumbrances on the property , since the lender wants to be able to take the property free and clear of any other claims against it . When a lender takes property as a deed in lieu , presumably the borrower ' s credit history has already been tarnished ; after all , the borrower has probably not been making mortgage payments for several months . However , it is my understanding that a deed in lieu does not get reported as a foreclosure proceeding on your credit history , and thus if the lender is willing to accept the deed in lieu of foreclosure , at least you may be able to avoid even further negative credit history . I strongly suggest that you contact your lender immediately , and have a face-to-face discussion with them . If your lender is no longer in your hometown , send them a letter and then call and make arrangements to talk to the most senior official at that mortgage lending company . The final option , of course -- which should be used only as a last_resort -- is for you to file bankruptcy . When someone files for bankruptcy , there are many protections that automatically apply from the day the bankruptcy petition is filed with the Bankruptcy Court . The most important protection under the bankruptcy law is what is known as &quot; the automatic stay. &quot; If you are in bankruptcy , no legal_action can be taken against your house unless the lender requests the court for permission to &quot; lift the stay. &quot; This means that the lender goes before the bankruptcy judge , in open hearing , and petitions the court to permit the foreclosure to take_place . Depending_on the circumstances , including the amount of equity you have in your house and the possibility of getting_back on your feet financially , the Bankruptcy Court may or may_not lift that stay .
