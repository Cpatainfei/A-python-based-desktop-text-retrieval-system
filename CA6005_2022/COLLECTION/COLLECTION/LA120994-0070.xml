   <TEXT> L.A. Abstraction : A diverse array of paintings , drawings , collages and prints by Lorser Feitelson ( 1898-1978 ) and John McLaughlin ( 1898-1976 ) at Tobey C . Moss Gallery outlines important connections and differences between the two Los Angeles abstractionists . This historically minded exhibition is most engaging , however , in its presentation of rarely seen pieces -- curious experiments the artists undertook and rejected , as they struggled to discover their mature , signature styles . In the earliest works , McLaughlin and Feitelson clearly crossed paths . Two small paintings from 1949 look as if they belong_to the other artist ' s oeuvre : McLaughlin uncharacteristically explored colors and curves , and Feitelson limited his picture to straight_lines and a black-and-white palette . Examples of McLaughlin ' s inquisitiveness abound . A compact still_life from 1946 reveals the magnitude of his leap to non-representational images in the mid-1950s . An actual tabletop from 1959 , painted in a clunky , computer-graphics pattern , and an all-over , interlocking pink-and-green gouache from 1960 reveal two approaches he momentarily flirted_with , but wisely did not pursue . In contrast , Feitelson is the more consistent , less inventive artist . Early sketches containing figure studies and preliminary designs for larger linear compositions suggest that his abstract canvases are meant to be seen in_relation_to bodies twisting and turning_in space . A single , vertically oriented stripe painting from 1953 stands_out as Feitelson ' s quirkiest work . Its odd combinations of burgundy , lavender , orange and lime green bands create a queasy , aggressive rhythm absent from his more graceful paintings of curved forms and flowing lines . Unlike McLaughlin , whose minimal paintings break free_of their sources , Feitelson ' s images refer back to their roots , suggesting similarities to popular graphic designs . * Tobey C .
