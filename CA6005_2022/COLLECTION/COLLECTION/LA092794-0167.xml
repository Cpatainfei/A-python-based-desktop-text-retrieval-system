   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; COLUMBIA TRISTAR VIDEO ANNOUNCES DEAL TO DISTRIBUTE IN FORMER SOVIET_UNION ; MOVIES : THE VENTURE WITH VARUS VIDEO HOPES TO CUT INTO THE MARKET FOR ILLEGALLY COPIED FEATURE_FILMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to reach millions of film lovers in the former Soviet_Union , Columbia TriStar Home Video announced a deal here Monday to distribute its tapes throughout Russia , the Baltics , and the Commonwealth of Independent States . In association with Varus Video , a Russian-Greek joint_venture , Columbia TriStar will be releasing Columbia , TriStar and Orion Pictures feature_films , along with the foreign and independent movies distributed by those companies . Sales in the venture ' s first year could approach a_million video-cassettes , said Christopher Deering , Columbia TriStar ' s executive_vice_president . Columbia TriStar hopes that by offering high-quality tapes , with lip-synced dubbing in the local language , video-happy consumers in the former Soviet_Union will eschew cheaper , illegal copies . Russians imported 64 million blank videocassettes last year , 90 % of which were used to make illegal copies of movies , said Chris Abel-Smith , managing director of Varus Video . Varus is also the distributor for Warner Home Video , the division of Warner Brothers that began distributing its videos in the former Soviet_Union in February . &quot; There ' s a very receptive market , &quot; Deering said . &quot; We are getting inquiries , unsolicited , from all_over , from stores ( that ) want to be in legal business with high-quality products. &quot; Video pirating has been so severe that the Motion_Picture Export Assn . of America imposed a boycott on the Russian market in June , 1991 . The ban was lifted in January , 1993 , after Russia founded an intellectual property agency and drafted laws to control the problem . Despite the government ' s effort to crack_down on the problem , illegally copied videos can be bought for 9 # 000 to 15 # 000 rubles ( $ 3.72 to $ 6.20 at the current exchange_rate ) in virtually every street kiosk in Russia . They include copies made from laser discs , duplicates of promotional copies and &quot; rag copies &quot; -- those shot with a video camera in a movie_theater right off the screen . &quot; We can now respectfully ask_for enforcement , now that we ' re officially in the marketplace , whereas , before , people could always say we have no choice but to pirate cassettes or to buy pirated cassettes , because it was the only thing on the marketplace , &quot; explained Ben Feingold , president of Columbia TriStar Home Video . Columbia TriStar releases -- including &quot; Platoon , &quot; &quot; The Fisher King &quot; and &quot; Flatliners &quot; -- went_on sale Monday for 25 # 000 rubles ( $ 10.32 ) . Tapes will be sold to individuals -- an estimated 8 million Russian households have video players -- and to video rental stores .</TEXT>
