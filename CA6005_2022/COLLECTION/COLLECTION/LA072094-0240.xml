   <TEXT> Lou Levinson , a color specialist at MCA / Universal Inc. , recalls with little nostalgia his many years in the trenches of movie post-production , converting film negatives into video images that could be shown on television screens around the world . &quot; If you ' re working with a good movie , that ' s fine , but a bad movie is torture , &quot; says Levinson , whose credits include &quot; E.T. &quot; and &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark. &quot; &quot; With a bad film , you can go so brain-dead it takes a tremendous amount of self-discipline to do a quality job. &quot; that ' s because a telecine colorist -- a telecine is the machine that converts film to video -- must scan the same film up_to eight times to make_it available in all_of the television formats now used around the world . It ' s painfully repetitive -- and expensive . The first pass can take 30 hours or more , at up_to $ 500 an hour . But with new European , American and Japanese high-definition television_systems threatening to create the need for even more of the same , film studio engineers have joined forces to create a method for transforming film negatives to the ones and zeros of the Information Age . Their goal : to create an electronic workhorse for the industry called the &quot; digital film master , &quot; or DFM . If successful , the effort will not only make life easier for post-production workers , it will also result in a digital film standard that could revolutionize the way Hollywood film archives are managed . With a digital duplicate of a film ' s original negative , a computer workstation can be used to transform the images , quickly and economically , into virtually any viewing format . Thousands of formatted master tapes that now need to be stored and maintained -- and are vulnerable to fading , fires and other dangers -- would no longer need such vigilant protection . &quot; Studios feel possibly if they can get a digital representation of the film more akin to a computer data storage tape , it might allow them a more secure and pristine representation of their investment , &quot; says M . Michael D ' Amore , vice_president of business development at Simi Valley-based BTS Broadcast Television_Systems Inc. , one of the key technology companies involved in the project . The digital film master could help film maintain its position as the industry ' s production standard of choice in an era of steadily improving video technology and increasing use of computerized special_effects . Such effects must be reproduced on optical film before they can be edited into a motion_picture , resulting in a loss of picture quality . With the DFM , however , movie_makers could potentially create effects directly on the digital duplicate , thus gaining better resolution -- and saving time and money . &quot; We thought if we could find a resolution high enough to capture everything that ' s on the film , we should be able to take that one digital recording and make all_the other versions we need , &quot; says Christopher J . Cookson , senior_vice_president of technical operations for Warner Bros . &quot; It ' s just a matter of putting_together the science that already exists with a different set of assumptions. &quot; With current technology , the process for converting a film into multiple video formats requires that a work negative , or &quot; interpositive , &quot; be struck from the original . It is then scanned through a telecine system that translates the picture into a digital recording . The telecine can output the image according to various specifications . The process is repeated to conform_to domestic and foreign transmission standards as well as the popular viewing formats : a &quot; pan-scan &quot; version that selectively frames a film ' s wider image for TV ; a &quot; letterbox , &quot; or smaller image , that retains a film ' s original dimensions ; and a wide-screen version for a new , increasingly popular type of European TV . The Film Technology Council of the Motion Picture-Television Industry Assn. , which is leading the effort , wants to streamline the process to a single scan . It believes this will be possible by stretching the limits of high-definition television . With an HDTV telecine system that corresponds closely to film ' s 35-millimeter screen dimensions , high-resolution images can be scanned to a data storage system resembling a large videocassette . But creation of a digital film master requires a recording unit with even more memory than an HDTV videocassette -- no small challenge . So far , the only machine that comes_close is an existing HDTV cassette_recorder jointly developed by BTS and Toshiba Corp . of Japan . After several months of testing by Warners ' Cookson and his team , the recorder is now being modified to expand its data storage capacity . &quot; I think we ' ll get there within two years , &quot; says D ' Amore of BTS . There is no question in the minds of its innovators that DFM technology can work . But once it does , the group will face another challenge : making the system affordable by promoting its adoption as an industry standard . &quot; In order to bring_down equipment costs , we would probably need the DFM to be accepted by film libraries industrywide , &quot; says Richard Stumpf , Universal ' s senior_vice_president of engineering and development . He estimates that each library will need to spend about $ 1.5 million to get the system up and running . &quot; But some could share the same facility , and the post-production community might even want to offer this as a service , &quot; he says . To address those and other issues , the technology council invited representatives from 10 major film libraries to meet last year . According to Update , the trade group ' s newsletter , the idea was met with &quot; general enthusiasm. &quot; Creating a Digital Master With the advent of high definition television and the proliferation of other new television formats around the world , film engineers are searching for a way to simplify the process of transferring film images to video . The creation of a Digital Film Master would eliminate the need to scan the film negative separately for each different video format , and could also be used to build secure and versatile digital film archives .
