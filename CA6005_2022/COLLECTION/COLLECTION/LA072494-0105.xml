   <TEXT> When he left home for the streets of Hollywood six years ago at age 12 , Levi Brett found a labyrinth of horrors . Besides the daily anxiety of seeking food and shelter , he saw other teen-agers shot , stabbed and gang-raped . Friends died of AIDS and drug overdoses . He begged , stole , numbed himself with drugs and once contemplated suicide . Now 18 , Brett still roams his old Hollywood haunts about three times a week , but with a black pouch bulging with safe-sex and drug-needle-cleansing materials such_as bleach kits , condoms and other paraphernalia . He has a new life as a peer outreach counselor -- someone who advises others his age -- at the Los Angeles Youth Network , a shelter and services organization for homeless youths in Hollywood . &quot; It ' s not what I say to them , but who I am -- they know me , the way I communicate , &quot; Brett said of the youths he counsels . &quot; Every time I go_out , I accomplish something . They ' re becoming more educated . They now ask which condoms are better and whether their bleach kits can be reused -- questions which they would n ' t ask an adult. &quot; The Los Angeles Youth Network is just one of a growing number of innovative programs on the Westside that employ teen-agers to counsel their peers on such issues as HIV prevention ; teen pregnancy ; tobacco , drug and alcohol_abuse , and suicide prevention . Although formalized teen peer counseling and education -- initially employed against drug use -- have existed for decades , the practice has been growing in popularity and has spread to other subjects . High_schools are using peer tutors for academic help in math and English . School administrators have set_up on-campus health clinics employing peer educators . Social agencies are increasingly using teen-agers to counsel gang members and mediate disputes . Alex , a homeless 17-year-old temporarily staying_at the Los Angeles Youth Network , prefers counseling from his peers rather than from adults . In a comment typical of others his age , he said : &quot; I feel uncomfortable around older people . I ' d rather talk to someone my own age who understands and is going_through what I ' m going_through -- someone I can trust. &quot; The recent proliferation of peer education projects on the Westside mirrors a national trend . About 40 # 000 peer education programs exist in schools nationwide , up from an estimated 20 # 000 five years ago , and such programs are growing in colleges , social agencies and church ministries , said Barbara Varenhorst , a member and former president of the National Peer Helpers Assn. , a national network of peer programs based in North Carolina . Many experts believe the expansion of peer counseling is filling a void in the lives of today ' s youths . Shattered families , drug and alcohol_abuse , and parental neglect have robbed many young people of a support network for their problems . Advocates say the surge in peer programs is also a compensation for the increasingly disparate ratio in many schools between students and adult counselors or mentors . &quot; I ' ve worked with young people for many years and know that adolescence is a lonely time , &quot; said Varenhorst , who started the country ' s first in-school peer counseling program in Palo Alto in 1970 . &quot; But never have I seen so_much loneliness as in this particular period . There are no adults around and peers are raising peers . Some schools have one adult counselor per 1 # 000 kids. &quot; Statistics point to the gulf between teen-agers and their parents and other adults . A 1986 Emory University Medical_School survey widely cited by experts asked 600 Atlanta-area high_school seniors who they would talk to about an alcohol or drug problem . Seventy percent said they would tell a friend , 20 % said they would go_to their parents and 8 % said they would tell siblings . There is a paucity of scientific_research comparing the effectiveness of teen peer counseling and education programs to programs that use adults to teach teen-agers . But many educators believe a mountain of anecdotal evidence proves the value of peer education , especially regarding sexual and reproductive health issues . &quot; Teens identify with teens and get most of their information and advice from their friends , not their parents , &quot; said Wendy Arnold , a founder of the Peer Education Program of Los Angeles in West Los Angeles , which educates teen-agers on AIDS-related issues . &quot; Mainstream educators are realizing that important information hasn ' t been getting_through and that the vehicle of communication has to change . The time is ripe to bring_in innovative strategies. &quot; In today ' s world , what youths don ' t know can kill them . As a result , many peer programs concentrate_on disseminating information on such topics as AIDS and safe_sex . The Los Angeles Unified School District has set_up on-campus health centers in four high_schools that use teen counselors to educate their classmates on a variety of preventive health measures . The clinics were installed about seven years ago and remain noteworthy for the variety of services offered , including counseling for sexually transmitted diseases and family_planning and prevention of HIV infection . The school district also has more_than 2 # 000 peer conflict mediators , working primarily in the city ' s elementary_schools . In addition , more_than 1 # 000 peer tutors work kindergarten through 12th grade to help students studying math and English . On a recent school_day at Los Angeles High_School in Hancock Park , Dana Shellmire , 15 , and Tyren McElwee , 16 , instructed a 10th-grade class on drug prevention . Before the two began their seminar , the class was typically boisterous as the harried adult teacher tried to keep the students ' attention . But when the teen-agers started the program , the students paid_attention . A seven-minute video , using Tyren ' s friends as actors , showed a mock trial of drugs and alcohol , with both substances judged guilty of first-degree murder . To demonstrate the pitfalls of peer pressure , Tyren and Dana then acted_out a skit depicting a party , with one playing a drug pusher and the other declining the narcotics . Other students were then chosen from the class to perform in an improvised skit that showed ways to refuse drugs . After the hourlong session , the students seemed impressed . &quot; If a grown-up was saying all this , I ' d listen but I would n ' t pay_attention , &quot; said 15-year-old Destiny Cooks . &quot; ( Adults ) just yell at you instead of talking to you . But these counselors talk more like our age , they ' re going through the same thing we ' re going through. &quot; Beverly Sokol , a teacher at the school , says that when she has addressed a class on similar touchy subjects there have been lots of yawns , rustling of papers and note-passing . &quot; When another kid comes_up , they ' re all quiet , &quot; she said . &quot; I remember this one kid counselor just walked up , whipped out this big rubber thing and started putting a condom on it , talking all_the while . I couldn ' t have done that at her age -- it would probably be difficult for me now. &quot; Said Sokol : &quot; All the girls in the class then started giving the guys a hard_time by saying , ' Yeah , you ' re going to be wearing this now. ' &quot; Ursula Lewis , one of the program ' s coordinators , said that teen audiences are not the only beneficiaries . &quot; The teen counselors get a great boost in self-esteem and confidence . They know they ' re being looked_at , and if they do something wrong they ' re busted . If they say it enough , they have to live it , &quot; she said . Childrens Hospital Los Angeles in Hollywood recently developed a two-year peer education program called Project SNAPP -- Skills and Knowledge for AIDS and Pregnancy Prevention . The program is unique because it uses youth educators who are teen-age parents or infected with HIV themselves , project organizers said . Besides visiting six L.A. unified middle_schools in the Hollywood , Wilshire and central Los Angeles areas , the peer counselors also fan_out to local teen social_service agencies . On a recent afternoon , peer educators Ken Benard , 23 , and Connie Garay , 19 , conducted a seminar for a small group of homeless youths at Options House , a teen shelter in Hollywood . The meeting started slowly with card and handshake games meant to enlighten the participants about the dangers of wanton sexual behavior . But the atmosphere electrified when Benard blurted_out that he is HIV-positive , explaining that he probably contracted the disease in his earlier years as a drug abusing and sexually promiscuous runaway . Questions soon tumbled forth from his young audience . &quot; How did you feel after the first test results ? &quot; &quot; Do you know who you got_it from ? &quot; &quot; Do you have any symptoms yet ? &quot; &quot; Can you die from HIV or AIDS ? &quot; Benard painstakingly answered the questions . But his young charges were clearly shaken -- he looked_like one of them . &quot; I was shocked that he could be so open_to people he hardly even knows , &quot; said Desiree , a 13-year-old who was left homeless by two crack-addicted parents . &quot; He looked just like a healthy normal person . You can ' t look_at everyone and know. &quot; After Benard finished talking , Garay told her story . Madly in_love with her boyfriend , she became pregnant with identical_twins just shy of her 15th birthday . Always an honor student , she left home and dropped_out of high_school to take_care of her children . After one year , her boyfriend left her . She related the desperation of being a teen-age mother . Constant work . Sleepless nights tending to the babies . Little help . Bus trips holding two squirming children . Dreams of college deferred . &quot; My children are without their father and we have little money , &quot; she said . &quot; I regret having kids before I can really give them what they need , a house , career , a family. &quot; Monique , a homeless teen-ager , wanted to know where the babies ' father lives . Another participant , Mike , 15 , asked if the birth was by Cesarean_section . Desiree wondered if Garay still yearns for a career . After only one hour , there were some sober reactions . &quot; These two really learned the hard way -- it didn ' t seem like some TV_show , &quot; Mike said . Such comments hearten the counselors , many of whom draw_on their experiences for motivation . As Levi Brett , the Hollywood outreach counselor who lives_in a shelter for homeless youths , makes his usual trek through the district ' s streets among pimps , pushers and perverts , he sometimes can ' t help thinking_of all_the adults who terrorized , abused or neglected him . The thought gives him special incentive . &quot; When I was homeless , I was scared , frightened and there was no peer outreach at the time , &quot; he said . &quot; Adults always used to talk_down to me like I was some worthless piece of garbage . But now we ' re doing so_much for ourselves -- you start to believe_in yourself again. &quot;</TEXT>
