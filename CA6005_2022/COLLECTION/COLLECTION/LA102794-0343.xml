   <HEADLINE> FORD SHIFTS INTO HIGH_GEAR ; COMPANY POSTS RECORD PROFIT ; INDUSTRY HEADS FOR ITS BEST YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ford Motor Co . reported the best third quarter in its history Wednesday and said the U.S. auto industry could be in_for a prolonged expansion that could yield strong sales and profits for several years to come . Ford , the nation ' s second-largest car builder , said it made $ 1.12 billion from July through September , compared to $ 463 million in the third quarter of 1993 . The strong profit resulted from brisk U.S. vehicle sales , improvement in European operations and a strong performance by Ford ' s financial services arm . Quarterly sales totaled $ 30.6 billion , up from $ 24.5 billion last year . Ford ' s performance surpassed that of Chrysler Corp. , which earlier reported earnings of $ 651 million . Both Ford ' s and Chrysler ' s results stood_in stark contrast to General Motors Corp. , whose auto operations lost money . Together the Big Three earned $ 2.3 billion in the third quarter , compared to $ 773 million a year ago . For the year , Detroit auto_makers have already earned $ 9.6 billion and appear certain to surpass the industry record of $ 11.2 billion earned in 1988 . The auto industry ' s performance over the past two years has been a main driver of the nation ' s economy . And auto industry officials say they are just revving_up their engines . &quot; We expect the vehicle demand in the U.S. will continue to be healthy , &quot; Ford Chairman Alex Trotman said . &quot; There should be plenty of life left in this cycle. &quot; With demand for vehicles high , the auto_makers have been boosting profits by reducing marketing_costs . For instance , the average incentive offered consumers by Ford was $ 725 per vehicle , down $ 135 from a year ago . David McCammon , Ford ' s treasurer and vice_president of finance , predicted industry sales will hit 15.5 million this year , up 9 % from last year . Barring an unexpected sharp increase in interest_rates , annual sales could peak at a record 16.5 million to 17 million vehicles before the next downturn in the economy , McCammon said . Wall_Street recently bid down auto stocks , reacting to GM ' s poor performance and fearing higher interest_rates could curb demand . On Wednesday , the Big Three were all among the most heavily traded shares on the New York Stock_Exchange . Ford shares added 37.5 cents to $ 29.25 and Chrysler gained 25 cents to $ 47.75. But GM fell 62.5 cents to $ 40.75. Last week , GM , the nation ' s No . 1 auto_maker , reported third-quarter earnings of $ 552 million , but that was all attributed to its non-auto operations . Its North_American auto operations lost $ 328 million , and its European auto earnings fell as well . GM ' s problems were tied to two strikes , production problems and high labor costs . &quot; GM ' s problems are of its own making and not indicative_of problems in the industry as_a_whole , &quot; said David Garrity , an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York . &quot; As long as demand holds_up -- and there is every indication it will -- auto earnings should continue to do well. &quot; Ford ' s earnings were a record in a quarter that is typically the weakest because of plant shutdowns for vacations , retooling of factories for model changes and higher costs for vehicle introductions . Ford earned $ 1.71 billion in the second quarter , its highest three-month profit ever . &quot; They beat everybody ' s expectations , &quot; said Nick Lobaccaro , an analyst with S.G. Warburg &amp; Co . &quot; They showed good progress all across the board. &quot; In Europe , Ford reported its first quarterly profit in five years . It earned $ 25 million , contrasted with a loss of $ 217 million last year . The company ' s financial services group continued to perform strongly , with earnings of $ 523 million , compared to $ 391 a year ago . Ford is undergoing a major reorganization aimed at reducing costs and integrating engineering and design operations worldwide . It is also making record capital spending on new vehicles , engines and transmissions . In its U.S. automotive operations , Ford earned $ 578 million , up from $ 333 million a year ago . It sold nearly 1.1 million cars and trucks , an increase of 17.5 % over a year ago . Ford made a profit of $ 865 on each vehicle it sold in the third quarter . Chrysler earned about $ 1 # 000 per vehicle , while GM lost $ 296 on each . GM , which lost nearly $ 18 billion in North_America in the last four years , has made great strides in turning_around its operations . It has closed inefficient plants , laid_off workers and wrested savings from suppliers . &quot; They ' ve run_out the string on those things , &quot; said David Healy , analyst with S . G . Warburg &amp; Co . &quot; The only way to cut costs now is to bring_out new models that are less complex and costly and easier to produce . But that will take time. &quot; Comeback for Auto_Makers Bolstered by record earnings from Ford Motor in the third quarter , the nation ' s Big Three automakers appear headed for their best year ever in 1994 . The Big Three automakers made $ 2.3 billion from July through September , roughly triple what they earned in the third quarter of 1993 .</TEXT>
