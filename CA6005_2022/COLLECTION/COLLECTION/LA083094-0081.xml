   <HEADLINE> GLOBAL AGRICULTURE ; CULTURE ; RICE NO LONGER EQUALS LIFE IN JAPAN ; GRADUAL OPENING OF THE MARKET SEALS THE FATE OF TRADITIONAL SYSTEM . CHANGES IN SOCIETY ALREADY HAVE DRASTICALLY CUT CONSUMPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Japan still has the character of a farm village , with a very consensus-oriented society , &quot; said Keizo Mochida , an agricultural economist at Wako University in Tokyo . &quot; Rice is the bottom_line in that , because to grow rice you have to cooperate with others for irrigation . Rice created the foundation of Japanese society. &quot; In daily life , the central role of rice is fading . The average person consumes 150 pounds of the grain each year , but that is down 40 % since 1962 . The percentage of Japan ' s population in farm households has fallen from 41 % in 1955 to 13 % today . The average age of farmers is now 56 , up from 37 in 1960 . Mochida sees change reflected in his students , who prefer whiskey or beer to sake , the Japanese rice wine . &quot; Overall , Japanese characteristics are disappearing , &quot; he said . &quot; You can call it internationalization . . . . But we want rice to survive . It symbolizes Japanese scenery and an attachment to the land . We don ' t want small mountain villages to die. &quot; Remote villages , where old ways_of_life change most slowly , have faced decline since the end of World_War_II . Even when sons take_over the family land , they often have trouble finding wives willing to endure the rigors of farm life . The only thing keeping many mountain villages alive is the outmoded national rice policy , which keeps prices at 10 times the world level . The policy has also brought stability -- for better or worse -- to less isolated areas , as people hang_on to small holdings they otherwise might sell . The old system might someday have collapsed under the weight of its own inefficiencies . But its fate was sealed by Japan ' s agreement in December , in a key contribution to a new global trade accord , to gradually open its rice market . Then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa described the move , taken under tremendous pressure from the United States , a top rice exporter , as a &quot; painful , heartbreaking decision. &quot; After nearly three decades of declaring that Japan would not import even a grain of rice , Tokyo was forced in rapid succession last year first to approve emergency imports -- because of a production shortfall caused by bad_weather -- and then to agree that beginning in 1995 it would import a minimum of 400 # 000 tons , with that figure rising to 800 # 000 by the year 2000 . Quotas will ultimately be replaced by gradually reduced tariffs , further opening the market to international competition . So far , the government , which controls all rice imports , marks_up foreign rice prices close to the level at which domestic rice is sold . This ensures that Japanese rice remains most popular , and provides profits that can be used to subsidize farmers . But eventually foreign rice will enter Japan at prices that undercut domestic varieties . Everyone in Japan , from the remotest hamlets to the halls of Parliament , is affected by the upheaval . Farmers ponder the future of their children , their land and their villages . &quot; How will the people who leave farming find other jobs ? &quot; asked Kenetsu Sasaki , 44 , a farmer in Tominaga Higashi , 25 miles from the northeastern city of Sendai . &quot; People here can commute to the city . But remote communities will collapse. &quot; There are only six full-time farmers left in his hamlet of 48 homes . But almost all families have kept their land , taking other jobs and growing rice on weekends . Sasaki farms 19 acres , a large spread by Japanese standards , with 97 % of his land in rice . Ten years from now , through leasing or possibly purchasing land from others , he hopes to have assembled nearly 40 acres . He hopes his 10-year-old son will follow him into farming , but figures he would need to work 75 acres to profit in the face of future foreign competition . Except in Japan ' s less-populated northern island of Hokkaido , farming on this scale -- while very modest by American standards -- has been virtually unimaginable in Japan . Japanese rice fields typically are divided into tiny plots of less than half an acre , surrounded by raised walkways that hold_back water and allow_for terracing of hillsides . The average Japanese rice farm is just under 2 acres , compared to 280 acres in the United States . Labor hours per acre are about 24 times greater in Japan . The result is that producing rice here costs more_than $ 2 # 000 a ton , compared to $ 200 a ton in the United States . The roots of this system go_back to a poor harvest in 1917 . Production fell just 7 % , but rice was subject_to rampant speculation , hoarding and market cornering in the unregulated capitalism of those days . By July of 1918 , the price of rice had doubled . Angry women in a fishing village on the Sea_of_Japan stormed rice stores in a protest that triggered rioting nationwide . The most serious was in Osaka , where hundreds of thousands took_to the streets . The Rice Riots lasted 50 days , involved 1 million people , and were suppressed by 50 # 000 soldiers . They led to a new Rice Law that provided_for government intervention in rice markets . Government control of rice was further strengthened in 1942 by the wartime Food Control Law . This law , which remains in_effect today , was designed to ensure that affordable rice was available to consumers and that farmers received sufficient payment to ensure production . Until the mid-1950s it worked mainly to consumers ' benefit . But then , as Japan achieved self-sufficiency in rice , it became a way for the Liberal Democratic Party , which governed from 1955 to 1993 , to funnel wealth to the countryside . The farm lobby became a key ingredient in the LDP ' s lock on power . No prime_minister dared reform the system or allow rice imports . Because even part-time rice farming remained profitable , farm families were unwilling to sell their land to their neighbors , which would have allowed the creation of larger , more efficient farms -- but also might have accelerated the depopulation of the countryside . Last summer , reformers headed by Hosokawa took power just as Japan experienced its worst rice harvest in decades . Emergency rice imports broke the spell of the old &quot; not one grain &quot; mantra , and Tokyo capitulated in the December trade talks . Whereas just two years ago analysts saw the Food Control Law as an unassailable sacred_cow of Japanese politics , Agriculture Ministry officials now indicate that a draft bill abolishing the law is likely to be introduced to Parliament this fall . New legislation would aim at freeing rice distribution and encouraging farmers to assemble larger , more economical plots of land . In essence , Japan ' s large and remarkably open black_market on rice would be legalized and the countryside would be commercialized . Such a result would be a victory for people like the flamboyant Isonobu Kawasaki , Japan ' s most famous accused rice criminal , who has long claimed that the current system does more to hold_back farmers than to help them . Kawasaki ' s brush with the law began in 1982 . By then , Japan ' s capacity for rice production exceeded demand and the government was paying farmers to hold part of their land out of production , a program that continues today . Participation is mandatory , but Kawasaki refused . The official agricultural cooperative handling rice purchases under the Food Control Law retaliated by refusing to buy his crop . Kawasaki responded by illegally selling his rice directly to consumers . Kawasaki ' s black_market shop prospered , and soon he was buying other farmers ' crops for resale . Thousands of others quietly took the same path . It is now estimated that out of the typical annual production of 10 million tons of rice , 6 million is distributed through legal government channels , 2 million is consumed by farmers and their relatives , and 2 million enters the black_market . Kawasaki , 58 , who comes from the part of Japan where the 1918 Rice Riots began , is now being prosecuted for illegal rice sales , the first and only such prosecution in more_than a decade . Yoshiyuki Hoshino , a Tokyo rice retailer , thinks the changes promoted by rebels like Kawasaki and by pressure from Washington mean the ultimate destruction of specialty shops like his , an open-fronted wooden storefront stacked with rice sacks that evokes the aura of a simpler Japan . Resigned to that fate , Hoshino has none of the traditional expectations that his son should take_over the shop . &quot; In the past , we thought_of rice and life as being the same , &quot; he said . &quot; Now my own son eats bread for breakfast and goes_off to work . Rice meals take time . It ' s not just Japan , the whole world is progressing . There ' s nothing you can do about it . So_long as a_few people preserve traditional culture , isn ' t that OK ? Rice won ' t disappear. &quot; Times researcher Chiaki Kitada in Tokyo contributed to this report .</TEXT>
