   <HEADLINE> NEW ' 3 STRIKES ' CHARGES FILED AGAINST OXNARD MAN ; CRIME : SECOND SET OF COUNTS FACING DEFENDANT RESULTS FROM ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT CELLMATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 52-year-old Oxnard man who allegedly tried to rape his cellmate while awaiting sentencing under the state ' s new &quot; three-strikes &quot; law was charged Wednesday under the tough statute a second time . Roosevelt Carlton McCowan is the first defendant charged under the three-strikes provision twice in Ventura County and might be the first in the state , authorities said . McCowan already faced a 25-years-to-life sentence for stealing 18 bottles of cologne when he was charged last month with attempted forcible sodomy and attempted sodomy in a corrections facility , both felonies . Either charge could be used as a basis for a second 25-years-to-life sentence , since each new felony beyond the original three can trigger a three-strikes prosecution . Prosecutors announced their decision to seek the second three-strikes conviction against McCowan for the sodomy case during an arraignment Wednesday in which the stocky , bearded defendant pleaded not_guilty . Enacted six months ago , the three-strikes law requires the long prison_term for anyone convicted of a felony who has two prior serious or violent felonies . Consequently , McCowan could be ordered to serve back-to-back sentences of 25 years to life if the sodomy charges against him lead to a conviction , Deputy Dist . Atty . Bob Calvert said . &quot; If a judge wanted to , he could stack two 25-year-to-life sentences , &quot; Calvert said . McCowan ' s attorney , Deputy Public_Defender Douglas W . Daily , said prosecutors are abusing their authority . &quot; My concern is when you throw enough weak cases in the air , the probability is that after a while something will stick , &quot; he said . McCowan is one of a handful of Ventura County defendants charged so far under the three-strikes law . But his case has drawn an inordinate amount of attention because he was first charged under the new law for petty theft , instead of a violent or drug-related offense . In selling the three-strikes law to the public , supporters promoted it as a way to rid California streets of violent offenders and drug dealers . Ventura County Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury has said that McCowan is violent and argued that the three-strikes law is being put to good use in his case . Saddled with a long rap sheet -- including convictions for assault , burglary and robbery -- McCowan was accused of stealing 18 bottles of cologne from an Oxnard Sav-on Drugs store March 8 . That was just one day after Gov . Pete Wilson signed the three-strikes measure into law . Because McCowan had a previous theft offense when he stole the cologne , he was convicted of felony petty theft by a Superior_Court jury July 21 -- paving the way for a mandatory three-strikes sentence . Two days after the cologne conviction , as his attorneys prepared an appeal , McCowan ' s 31-year-old cellmate told guards at the Ventura County Jail that McCowan had tried to rape him . The man , who had been serving a short jail term for petty theft , testified at a preliminary hearing that McCowan chased him around their small cell for more_than an hour while trying to molest him . Prosecutors originally charged McCowan with forcible sodomy . But a judge reduced the charge to attempted forcible sodomy after hearing the victim ' s testimony . Superior_Court Judge Allan L . Steele set a jury trial in the sodomy case for Oct . 23 . Daily has filed a motion to overturn the cologne conviction . A hearing is set for Sept . 9 in Superior_Court . Prosecutor Calvert said the district_attorney ' s office did not consider McCowan ' s cologne conviction when deciding to charge him as a three-strikes defendant a second time . In court papers , prosecutors cite a 1978 residential burglary and a 1988 robbery as his first two strikes , and reasons he should receive 25 years to life in prison if convicted of attempted sodomy . &quot; We evaluate each case on its merits and make the decision , and that ' s what we did_in this case , &quot; Calvert said .</TEXT>
