   <HEADLINE> CLINTON NAMES DEVAL PATRICK FOR CIVIL RIGHTS POST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton nominated Deval L . Patrick , a Boston lawyer with extensive civil_rights experience , on Tuesday to head the Justice_Department ' s civil_rights division -- a position that has been vacant for nearly a year . Conservatives , who led a successful fight against Clinton ' s first choice , University of Pennsylvania professor C . Lani Guinier , immediately branded Patrick &quot; a stealth Guinier , &quot; prompting Clinton to question whether they were acting in good_faith and to charge that they &quot; don ' t give a rip about civil rights. &quot; Patrick , 37 , who like Guinier is black , grew_up near one of the poorest public housing projects on Chicago ' s South_Side . But he won a scholarship to a prestigious prep_school and another to Harvard as an undergraduate and worked in Africa as a Rockefeller traveling fellow . He subsequently earned a Harvard law_degree . He served as a clerk for Los Angeles Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals . With those credentials , &quot; he could have had probably any job he wanted with just about any law_firm in America , &quot; Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said as she introduced him at a White_House ceremony . Instead , she said , he chose to practice civil_rights law with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , where he represented Death Row inmates and handled extensive voting_rights litigation . For eight years , Patrick has worked for a top Boston law_firm , where he has spent nearly a third of his time on pro bono public_service cases . Patrick said that he is &quot; humbled &quot; by the nomination and feels as though he is &quot; standing . . . on the shoulders of those courageous advocates of every type and kind who have had the guts to stand_up in some court somewhere and give the Constitution life. &quot; Clint Bolick , vice_president of the conservative Institute for Justice , who led the criticism of Guinier by labeling her &quot; Clinton ' s quota queen , &quot; issued a press_release only hours before Patrick was formally nominated , saying that he &quot; appears to be a stealth Guinier. &quot; &quot; He has no paper trail , &quot; he said , referring to Guinier ' s extensive and controversial writings , some of which Clinton later disavowed . &quot; But ( he ) is part of the same pro-quota chorus that produced Guinier. &quot; Clinton responded to the criticism with unusual bite . &quot; The truth is that a lot of those people are going_to be exposed , because they never believed_in the civil_rights laws , they never believed_in equal_opportunity , they never lifted a finger to give anybody of a minority race a chance in this country , &quot; Clinton said . Carl Stern , the Justice_Department ' s chief spokesman , said that neither Patrick nor the Administration supports quotas as a means of achieving affirmative_action . &quot; I think the public is getting tired_of distortions . Mr. Bolick is committed to gutting the civil_rights laws . The fox shouldn ' t be choosing who guards the chicken house. &quot; The responses to criticism of Patrick stood_in sharp contrast to the Administration ' s less aggressive posture when Guinier was under_attack . When Clinton eventually bowed to political pressure and withdrew her nomination , civil_rights leaders openly condemned the Administration for failing to support her and for denying her the opportunity to defend and explain her views before the Senate Judiciary Committee , which would have conducted her confirmation_hearing . Clinton ' s second choice , District_of_Columbia Corporate Counsel John Payton , withdrew in December after opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus over his failure to vote_in local elections and his apparent unfamiliarity with a major voting_rights case . This time , Rep . John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , former chairman of the caucus , praised Patrick as an &quot; outstanding choice &quot; and said that &quot; his combination of credentials and life experience will be a boon to the ( Justice ) department. &quot; Clinton ' s failure to fill the post has been viewed by critics as a failure to convert campaign pledges into action and has contributed to the appearance of disarray at the department , where Deputy Atty . Gen . Philip B . Heymann unexpectedly resigned Thursday , citing differences of style and chemistry with Reno . An announcement of Heymann ' s successor could come_by the end of the week , Administration sources said . The choices appear to include Charles F . C . Ruff , a former Watergate prosecutor and Justice_Department official who was Reno ' s first choice for the job ; Pentagon general counsel Jamie Gorelick , who helped guide Reno ' s nomination through the Senate Judiciary Committee , and Ronald K . Noble , assistant Treasury_secretary for enforcement . Clinton , a supporter of capital_punishment , acknowledged at the White_House ceremony that he disagrees_with an argument Patrick helped advance to the Supreme Court that the death_penalty should be struck_down as racially discriminatory . Reno also opposes the death_penalty , although she has pledged to enforce it . Patrick litigated two cases with Guinier when both worked for the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People . They had discussed the possibility of his nomination to the post , according to sources who know them both . Guinier was said to have expressed concern over the possibility that her friend would be &quot; brutalized &quot; by the confirmation process but hoped that he would take the job .</TEXT>
